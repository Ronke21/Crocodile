<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels, ten powered and coupled driving wheels, and two trailing wheels. In the United States and elsewhere the is known as the Santa Fe type, after the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway that first used the type in 1903.

==Overview==
The wheel arrangement evolved in the United States from the 2-10-0 Decapod of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF). Their existing 2-10-0 tandem compound locomotives, used as pushers up Raton Pass, encountered problems reversing back down the grade for their next assignments since they were unable to track around curves at speed in reverse and had to run very slowly to avoid derailing. Consequently, the ATSF added a trailing truck to the locomotives which allowed them to operate successfully in both directions. These first locomotives became the forerunners to the entire family.

The trailing truck allows a larger, deeper firebox than that of a . Like all ten-coupled designs, the long rigid wheelbase of the coupled wheels presented a problem on curves, requiring flangeless drivers, lateral motion devices and much sideplay on the outer axles. To limit this problem, the coupled wheels were generally small, up to in diameter, which in turn generated the problem of insufficient counterweights to balance the weight of the driving rods.

The &#x27;s inherent problem was the low speed restriction on the type, which was about . Further, the had other inherent restrictions. The massive cylinders that were required on locomotives in the United States for high tractive effort had the result that no reasonably sized valves could admit and exhaust steam at a sufficient rate to permit fast running. In addition the , like the , had its main rod connected to the middle coupled axle, very near to the centre of gravity, which created a violent nosing (waddling) action when operating at speed. The peak of the design limitations was reached in the United States in 1926 and was overcome with the advent of the superior 2-10-4 design.

==Usage==
Locomotives with a wheel arrangement were used in a number of countries around the world, including those in North America, Western Europe, China, the Soviet Union and Africa. Continental Europe saw a fair number of , although the type was always less popular than Mikados and 2-10-0 Decapods. A large number of European were tank locomotives, taking advantage of the symmetrical nature of the wheel arrangement.

===Argentina===
The metre gauge General Manuel Belgrano Railway in Argentina operated the E2 series of 2-10-2 locomotives. In 1956, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan constructed a batch of ten 2-10-2s based on this design for the isolated Ramal Ferro Industrial Río Turbio (RFIRP) 750 mm gauge railway in the southern Patagonian Desert, to haul coal from Río Turbio for shipping from Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz. These required modification by Livio Dante Porta to achieve their full potential. Ten more powerful examples were introduced into service in 1964.

===Belgian Congo===
Two classes of locomotives were used in the Belgian Congo.
* Two locomotives were built by Forges, Usines et Fonderies de Haine-Saint-Pierre for the in 1937, numbered 60 and 61. They had cylinders and coupled wheels, with a working order mass of .
* One locomotive was built for the by Société Anonyme John Cockerill in 1947, numbered 901 and later renumbered 802. It had cylinders and coupled wheels, with a working order mass of , a grate area of and a tractive effort at 65% boiler pressure of .

===Canada===
In 1916, Canadian Government Railways (CGR) took delivery of ten built by ALCO. After CGR became part of Canadian National Railways (CNR) in 1918, these locomotives were designated Class . Ten more were delivered from the Montreal Locomotive Works in 1918, and another 25 slightly modified in 1920 that were lighter. Canadian Locomotive Company produced five in 1924. Ten ALCO&#x27;s named were acquired from the Boston and Albany Railroad in 1928. Canadian Locomotive Company produced the last series of for CNR, a batch of 15 in 1929, and 18 in 1930.

The began to be scrapped in the mid-1950s, with the last models being used until 1961. There are two surviving CNR locomotives. One is No. 4008, on display at the CNR Station in Rainy River, Ontario, and the other is No. 4100, on display at the Canadian Railway Museum in Delson, Quebec.

===China===

The mainstay of Chinese steam was their locomotives. This was the wheel arrangement of the Chinese QJ class locomotives that were based on the Soviet locomotive class LV and built by Datong Locomotive Works from 1959. They were produced until 1988 and were still in widespread service until the final steam runs in 2005.

After retirement, some of these QJ class locomotives found their way to the United States, where they are used in revenue freight and excursion service. In Train Festival 2011, Multipower International restored two Chinese locomotives to Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Part 230 specifications and delivered them to the Railroad Development Corporation.

===Germany===

Examples on the German railway systems included classes BR84 and BR85, both standard tank locomotive designs built in 1935 and 1937 respectively, and class BR95, a tank locomotive built in 1922 by the Prussian State Railways as the Prussian T 20.

From 1936, the German railways built 28 three-cylinder tender freight locomotives of class BR45, which were the most powerful steam locomotives on the system.

Further examples, still in regular service, are the metre-gauge DR Class 99.23-24 on the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways and the 750 mm-gauge DR Class 99.77-79 on the Rügen narrow-gauge railway.

===Greece===

SEK (, Hellenic State Railways) class Μα (or class Ma; Mu-alpha) was a class of 2-10-2 steam locomotives built by Ansaldo and Breda in 1953. They were numbered Μα 1001-1020.

The Μα locomotives were the last steam locomotives acquired by SEK before conversion to diesel traction. They were designed and built in Italy by Breda (10 units) and Ansaldo (10 units) in 1953–1954, while some parts (including whole tender underframes) were made by Nuove Reggiane. The length of the locomotive with the tender was 24.93 m, the maximum height 4.51 m and service weight 136 t. The boiler operated at , and their rated power was . Maximum speed was 90 km/h.

Due to various technical problems, only two years after introduction they were modified by Henschel (1957–1958). The boilers were converted to burn heavy fuel oil.

These locomotives were based at Aghios Ioannis Rentis and Thessaloniki depots and were used mainly for freight trains and for some express passenger trains on Piraeus–Thessaloniki and Thessaloniki–Idomeni mainlines until the early 1970s, when they were withdrawn by the Hellenic Railways Organisation (successor of SEK) due to complete conversion to diesel traction.

Only two examples survived the 1984-1985 steam locomotives scrappings. One of them, 1002 was set on display as part of the theatre , at Rouf station in Athens. The other one is at Thessaloniki old railway station, not preserved.

=== India ===
The Bombay Port Trust had a pair of 2-10-2 tank locomotives, numbered 25H and 26H, for hump shunting, weighing in at 105.5 tons. Built by Nasmyth, Wilson and Company in 1922, they had driving wheels, and cylinders. Both were withdrawn and scrapped in 1976.

===Mozambique===

While the wheel arrangement was not very common in Africa, the Lourenco Marques system in Mozambique ( or CFM) had altogether 37 locomotives of this type, in three classes.
* Nine locomotives of the Series 200, numbered 201 to 209, were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works between 1915 and 1919.
* Six more Santa Fe type locomotives of the Series 214, numbered 214 to 219, were built by Henschel and Son in 1951.
* Twenty-two locomotives of the Series 250, numbered 251 to 272, were built by Henschel in 1955.

===Philippines===
The Manila Railroad Company (now the Philippine National Railways) acquired ten 200-class locomotives in 1922 from the American Locomotive Company (Alco) and was purchased alongside the 4-8-2 170-class. Based on Henry Kirke Porter&#x27;s acclaimed design of the 45 class, these were intended to replace the original Scottish-built tank locomotives as well as a small group of 4-4-2 tender locomotives that were acquired from the company&#x27;s predecessors.

They were serviced to haul heavy freight trains on the South Main Line between Manila and . This class also had one of the largest cylinders of any unarticulated Cape-gauge locomotive according to Alco, but it comparatively had small boilers and grills. Their arrival also called for larger turntables in both ends of the line, making them some of the largest and most powerful locomotives that entered Philippine service.

Out of ten locomotives, four managed to survive World War II, all of which were still in active service in 1952. However, these locomotives were retired after the MRR turned to upgrading its fleet to diesel locomotives in 1956. Not a single unit was preserved.
===Poland===

Twenty-five OKz32 2-10-2 tank locomotives were built by H. Cegielski – Poznań and delivered to PKP between 1934 and 1936. They were used mainly to work passenger trains between Kraków and Zakopane, a difficult railway line, steep in places, with many sharp curves, and requiring three direction changes. One has been preserved in working condition.

===Romania===

Romania designed its 151.000 Class as freight locomotives to serve on the Căile Ferate Române (CFR). These locomotives used a straightforward two-cylinder engine with coupled wheels and a total weight in working order of . The heating surface of the boiler was , of which were superheated, while the grate area was . At a tractive effort of , they were the most powerful steam locomotives built in Romania.

Two of these locomotives were built by the Malaxa Works in 1939 and 1941, numbered 151.001 and 151.002. Number 151.002 was preserved.

===South Africa===

On , this wheel arrangement was first used by the South African Railways (SAR) in 1927. Two Class 18 steam locomotives, the most powerful non-articulated locomotives to see service on the SAR, were introduced on the line between Witbank and Germiston in an attempt to ease problems that were being experienced with increasingly heavy coal trains. It was designed by Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1922 to 1929, and built by Henschel and Son in Germany. They were three-cylinder locomotives, with the two outer cylinders using Walschaerts valve gear and the inner cylinder using Gresley conjugated valve gear, actuated by the motions of the outer cylinders.
One more locomotive, the Class 20, was designed for branch line work on light rail by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer from 1929 to 1936. Only one locomotive was built by the SAR at its Pretoria Mechanical Shops at Salvokop in 1935.

In 1950, this sole Class 20 locomotive was modified to an experimental condensing locomotive, equipped with a condensing tender that was ordered from Henschel in Germany in 1948. Beginning in 1951, tests with the condensing Class 20 were conducted in the Eastern Transvaal and the Karoo. The positive results of the condensing trials proved the viability of condensing locomotives in South Africa and led to the introduction of the Class 25 condensing locomotive fleet in 1953.

===Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Union, locomotives were used to haul heavy freight trains. Two series were relatively common, the FD (for Felix Dzerzhinsky) with more than three thousand built through the 1930s, and the LV (Lebedyansky, modified by the Voroshilovgrad plant).
The FD class was developed from ALCO and Baldwin heavy freight locomotives that were imported to the Soviet Union, where they were designated as the Ta and Tb classes respectively. The first FD class locomotive was built at the Voroshilovgrad Locomotive Plant in 1931.

In 1932, the Voroshilovgrad plant began with the mass production of FD20 locomotives. In the process of production, their construction was improved constantly. Production was interrupted at the outbreak of the Great Patriotic war in 1941 and was only resumed in 1942, when four locomotives were built in Ulan Ude. The total production was 2,927 locomotives of FD20, and 286 locomotives of FD21. The two subclasses only differed in respect of their types of superheater.
In 1958, 1,054 FD class locomotives were sold to China, where they worked until the 1980s. A much lesser number were sold to North Korea at around the same time.

The Soviet locomotive class LV was developed from the previous L class 2-10-0 locomotive by the Voroshilovgrad plant. It used a feedwater heater to increase thermal efficiency and was the most efficient freight steam locomotive in the Soviet Union, with thermal efficiency of 9.3%. The first prototype was named OR18-01 (October Revolution plant, 18 ton axle load). A total of 522 LV class locomotives were built. Several were preserved, including the first, OR18-01, and the last, LV-0522.

===Spain===

In Spain, the wheel arrangement was represented by one series of 22 locomotives. They were initially ordered for the , but RENFE kept the entire series in reserve. Built between 1941 and 1944 in the factory in Barcelona for hauling heavy coal trains, they were amongst the most powerful steam locomotives in Europe. They had three cylinders, but used simple expansion and were known as &quot;Santa Fe&quot; locomotives. 
===United States===

In the United States, the type was produced between 1903 and 1930. The first were the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&amp;SF) engines of the 900 and 1600 series, which were an early type with few advantages over the Decapod, save their ability to operate in reverse without derailing. By 1919, the AT&amp;SF was building the definitive type, with the trailing truck supporting a large firebox. These were of the AT&amp;SF 3800 class. One of them, AT&amp;SF engine No. 3829, was equipped with an experimental two-axle trailing truck to become the first Texas type.
About 2,200 Santa Fe types were built, including about 500 of the two United States Railroad Administration (USRA) First World War standard designs. There were two USRA standard , the heavy version with an engine weight of and the light version with an engine weight of . The Santa Fe had the most with 352 engines.

Of the built for the Santa Fe, only one has been preserved. AT&amp;SF No. 940 is on static display outside the Santa Fe depot, now a Visitor Center, in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.
The heaviest were ten locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Reading Railway , weighing , engine only.

At , the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s 2800 class rebuilds probably had the highest calculated tractive effort of any two-cylinder steam locomotive, although the adhesive weight was only .
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ordered its first from Baldwin in 1914. From 1914 to 1956, their bore numbers commencing with &quot;6&quot;, hence the nickname &quot;Big Sixes&quot;. Designated the S class, there were several sub-classes. The first of the Big Sixes was retired in 1951 and were all scrapped by 1960.
The Southern Railway (SOU) ordered its first batches of fifty-five Ss class steam locomotives (Nos. 5000–5054) from Baldwin in 1917. The second batches of twenty-five (Nos. 6350–6374) were built by the American Locomotive Company&#x27;s (ALCO) Richmond Works in 1918 originally for SOU&#x27;s Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific (CNO&amp;TP) division. The latter batches were later moved to the SOU&#x27;s main division and renumbered to 5055–5079 when they were proved to be too bulky for the CNO&amp;TP tunnels&#x27; tight clearances. After receiving the last batches of Ss types, the SOU received fifty more (Nos. 5200–5249) from ALCO&#x27;s Brook Works in a USRA Light Santa Fe design which were classified as Ss-1. Both classes were assigned to SOU&#x27;s Asheville division, banking and hauling heavy freight trains up the steep Saluda Grade and Old Fort Loops in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Between the late 1930s and the early 1950s, all of the Ss and Ss-1 steam locomotives were retired and scrapped with none surviving into preservation.

The Union Pacific Railroad rostered 144 locomotives, under the designation of TTT (Two-Ten-Two). They were divided into classes TTT-1 through TTT-7, but all had the same cylinder dimensions, driving wheel diameter and boiler pressure. Of these, only one locomotive survives; Union Pacific 5511 was donated to the Railroading Heritage of Midwest America, who are restoring the locomotive to operation.

The Denver and Rio Grande Western rostered ten locomotives, under the class designation of F-81, rostered as Nos. 1400–1409, and purchased from Alco in 1916. None survived into preservation, all of them being scrapped between 1952 and 1955.

<text>When Worlds Collide is a 1933 science fiction novel co-written by Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie; they also co-authored the sequel &quot;After Worlds Collide&quot; (1934). It was first published as a six-part monthly serial (September 1932 through February 1933) in &quot;Blue Book&quot; magazine, illustrated by Joseph Franké.

==Synopsis==
Sven Bronson, a Swedish astronomer working at an observatory in South Africa, discovers a pair of rogue planets, Bronson Alpha and Bronson Beta, which will soon enter the Solar System. In eight months, they will pass close enough for gravitational forces to cause catastrophic damage to the Earth. Sixteen months later, after swinging around the Sun, Bronson Alpha (a gas giant) will return to pulverize the Earth and depart. Bronson Beta (discovered to be Earth-like and potentially habitable) may remain and assume a stable orbit.

Scientists led by American Cole Hendron work desperately to build an atomic rocket to transport enough people, animals and equipment to Bronson Beta to save humanity from extinction. Various other countries do the same. The United States evacuates coastal regions in preparation for the first encounter. As the planets approach, observers see through their telescopes cities on Bronson Beta. Tidal waves sweep inland at a height of , volcanic eruptions and earthquakes add to the deadly toll, and the weather runs wild for more than two days. Bronson Alpha grazes and destroys the Moon.

Three men receive permission from Hendron to take a floatplane to check out conditions across the United States and meet with the President in Hutchinson, Kansas, the temporary capital of the United States. All three are wounded fighting off a mob at their last stop, but manage to return with a precious sample of an extremely heat-resistant metal one of them had noticed. This solves the last remaining engineering obstacle: no material had been found before to make rocket tubes capable of withstanding the heat of the atomic exhaust.

Five months before the end, desperate mobs attack the camp, killing over half of Hendron&#x27;s people before they are defeated; the defenders take up the rocket, hover, and blast the enemy with its deadly exhaust. With the rocket tube breakthrough, the survivors are able to build a second, larger ship that can carry everyone left alive (instead of only 100 of the roughly thousand people Hendron had recruited). The two American ships take off, but lose contact with each other. Other ships are seen launching from Europe; the French ship&#x27;s tubes melt, causing it to crash. The original American ship makes a successful landing, but it is unknown if anyone else made it. The survivors find that Bronson Beta is habitable. They also find a road.

The sequel, &quot;After Worlds Collide&quot;, details the fate of the survivors on Bronson Beta.

==Adaptations and influences==
&quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; had far-reaching influences on the science fiction genre. The themes of an approaching planet threatening the Earth, and an athletic hero, his girlfriend, and a scientist traveling to the new planet by rocket, were used by writer Alex Raymond in his 1934 comic strip &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. Jack Williamson&#x27;s 1934 short story &quot;Born of the Sun&quot; also used the concept of a scientist and his fiancée escaping the destruction of the Earth in a hurriedly constructed &quot;ark of space&quot;. The 1940–1941 newspaper comic strip &quot;Speed Spaulding&quot;, an adaptation credited to the novel&#x27;s authors, was more directly based on the novel. The themes of escape from a doomed planet to a habitable one also can be seen in Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster&#x27;s 1938 comic &quot;Superman&quot;.

The novel was adapted as the 1951 film &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, produced by George Pal and directed by Rudolph Maté, which in turn was adapted into a comic book by George Evans in &quot;Motion Picture Comics&quot; #110 (Fawcett Comics, May 1952).

In 2012, the British composer Nigel Clarke wrote a large-scale work for brass band inspired by the film and likewise titled &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;.

<text>Tanglewood is a music venue and festival in the towns of Lenox and Stockbridge in the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts. It has been the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra since 1937. Tanglewood is also home to three music schools: the Tanglewood Music Center, Tanglewood Learning Center, and the Boston University Tanglewood Institute. Besides classical music, Tanglewood hosts the Festival of Contemporary Music, jazz and popular artists, concerts, and frequent appearances by James Taylor, John Williams, and the Boston Pops.

==History==

=== Early beginnings ===


The history of Tanglewood begins with a series of concerts held on August 23, 25 and 26, 1934, at the Interlaken estate of Daniel Hanna, about a mile from today’s festival site. A few months earlier, composer and conductor Henry Kimball Hadley had scouted the Berkshires for a site and support for his dream of establishing a seasonal classical music festival. He found an enthusiastic and capable patron in Gertrude Robinson Smith. Within a few months they had organized a series of concerts featuring the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, where Hadley once had been the associate conductor. Staged in an amphitheater built on the estate&#x27;s show horse ring, the first concert was attended by Sara Delano Roosevelt, the President&#x27;s mother. Heartened by the success of this effort, Robinson and Hadley organized another well received series of concerts in Interlaken the following summer.

==== Boston Symphony Orchestra era begins, 1936 ====
After two seasons featuring the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), under the direction of Conductor Serge Koussevitzky, was invited to perform at the 1936 festival held at Holmwood, the home of Margaret Vanderbilt in nearby Lenox. The BSO gave its first concert in the Berkshires on August 13, 1936. For nearly eighty years the BSO has remained the crown jewel of the music festival.

==== Festival moves to Tanglewood, 1937 ====
In 1937 the festival site was moved to &quot;Tanglewood&quot;, an estate donated by Mrs. Gorham Brooks and Miss Mary Aspinwall Tappan, daughter of William Tappan and Caroline Sturgis. &quot;Tanglewood&quot; took its name from &quot;Tanglewood Tales&quot;, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, while he lived in a cottage located on the estate.

The season consisted of six concerts over two weeks given inside a temporary tent erected around a plywood shell. Event press noted how the concerts had already become high society events.

On August 12, 1937, a thunderstorm interrupted a performance of Richard Wagner&#x27;s Ride of the Valkyries. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that &quot;Gertrude Robinson Smith strode purposefully to the stage when the concert stopped and addressed the record crowd of 5,000, haranguing: &#x27;Now do you see why we must have a permanent building for these concerts?&#x27; In minutes, more than $30,000 was raised.&quot;

==== Music Shed opens, 1938 ====
The following year, the Eliel Saarinen-designed, fan-shaped Shed (now known as the Koussevitzky Music Shed, or simply &quot;The Shed&quot;) was constructed, with some 5,100 seats, giving the BSO a permanent open-air structure in which to perform. Broad lawns extend beyond the Shed, providing outdoor space for concert goers and sweeping views of Stockbridge Bowl and Monument Mountain in the distance. At the opening ceremony for the Shed on August 4, 1938, Gertrude Robinson Smith&#x27;s dedication comments were recorded and can be heard today.

=== Later history ===
The Boston Symphony Orchestra has performed in the Koussevitzky Music Shed every summer since 1938, except for the interval 1942–45 when the Trustees canceled the concerts and summer school due to World War II, and during summer 2020, when performances were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Shed was renovated in 1959 with acoustic designs by BBN Technologies. In 1986 the BSO acquired the adjacent Highwood estate, increasing the property area by about 40%. Seiji Ozawa Hall (1994) was built on this newly expanded property. Leonard Bernstein conducted the Boston Symphony at Tanglewood. In 1986, a then 14-year-old Midori would debut with the BSO and snap two E-strings, one on the concertmaster&#x27;s Stradivarius, playing Bernstein&#x27;s Serenade after Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;. In August 1990, Bernstein would conduct what proved to be his final concert, which Deutsche Grammophon would later release as a live recording on CD.

==== Aaron Copland ====

Following his death in 1990, composer Aaron Copland&#x27;s ashes were scattered over the Tanglewood Music Center. There is a memorial garden with a bust of Copland on the Tanglewood grounds.

== Young musicians ==
In addition to hosting world-renowned programs of classical, jazz, and popular music, Tanglewood provides musical training. In 1940 conductor Serge Koussevitzky initiated a summer school for approximately 300 young musicians, now known as the Tanglewood Music Center. Also nearby is the Boston University Tanglewood Institute (BUTI), a program that collaborates with young musicians. Days in the Arts (DARTs) is for middle school students and is another organization that collaborates with Tanglewood. Other youth-symphony organizations have performed at either the Music Shed or Ozawa Hall, including the Norwalk Youth Symphony, from Norwalk, Connecticut, the Empire State Youth Orchestra, from Albany, New York, and the Greater Boston Youth Symphony (currently known as the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras).

==BSO and Tanglewood music directors==
* Serge Koussevitzky (1936–1949)
* Charles Munch (1949–1962)
* Erich Leinsdorf (1962–1969)
* William Steinberg (1969–1972)
* Seiji Ozawa (1973–2002)

* Andris Nelsons (2014–present)

== Facilities ==
* The Koussevitzky Music Shed was inaugurated in 1938, with major acoustic refurbishment made in 1959. Originally unnamed, the Shed was re-dedicated to TMC&#x27;s founder in 1988. Most BSO, all Pops and some TMC orchestra concerts are held there.
* Seiji Ozawa Hall opened in 1994 and is the place where most Tanglewood chamber concerts, as well as TMC orchestra concerts, now take place. Designed by William Rawn Associates, Architects, Inc. of Boston, Massachusetts, Seiji Ozawa Hall has been ranked one of the two Best Concert Halls in the U.S. built in the past 50 years, one of the four Best Concert Halls ever built in the U.S., and the 13th Best Concert Hall in the world (from Leo Beranek&#x27;s &quot;Concert Halls and Opera Houses&quot;). Seiji Ozawa Hall has received numerous awards for its architecture, including a National American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Interior Architecture (2000) and a National American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture (1995). The acoustics of the hall were designed in conjunction with the architect by R. Lawrence Kirkegaard, of Kirkegaard Associates.
* The Aaron Copland Library, Theatre, Chamber Music Hall and additional administrative, performance and practice buildings are spread throughout the Tanglewood grounds.

<text>The Whitehall Mystery is an unsolved murder that took place in London in 1888. The dismembered remains of a woman were discovered at three sites in the centre of the city, including the construction site of New Scotland Yard, the new police headquarters. The incident belongs to the so-called Thames Torso Murders.

==Discoveries==
On 11 September 1888, a right arm and shoulder were discovered on the muddy shore of the River Thames in Pimlico. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper had initially suspected that the arm was placed in the water as a medical students&#x27; prank.
On 2 October 1888, during construction of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s new headquarters, to be known as New Scotland Yard, on the Victoria Embankment near Whitehall in Westminster, a worker found a parcel containing human remains. The female torso was discovered in a three-month-old vault that made up part of the cellar. It was placed there at some point after 29 September when Richard Lawrence, a workman, had last been inside the unlocked vault. The body had been wrapped in cloth, possibly a black petticoat, and tied with string. The torso was matched by police surgeon Thomas Bond to the previously found arm and shoulder.

On 17 October 1888, reporter Jasper Waring used a Spitsbergen dog, with the permission of the police and the help of a labourer, to find a left leg cut above the knee that was buried near the construction site.

The head and remaining limbs were never found, and the identity of the victim was never established.

==Speculation==
Newspapers suggested a connection between this murder and the Jack the Ripper murders in and around the Whitechapel district that were occurring simultaneously, but the Metropolitan Police ruled out any connection between the cases. An inquest was opened by Westminster&#x27;s coroner, John Troutbeck, on 8 October. It determined that the woman had been &quot;of large stature and well-nourished&quot;, and suggested that she had been approximately 24 years old and 5 feet 8 inches in height. The uterus had been removed from the body. The right arm had been severed by someone with knowledge of human anatomy, had been tourniqueted to stem blood flow, and due to the lack of muscle contraction, was removed post-mortem. It was also revealed that the victim had been wearing a broché satin dress at the time of death.

The dress had been manufactured in Bradford, England, from a pattern estimated as three years old. Pieces of newspaper found with the remains were from the &quot;Echo&quot; of 24 August and an issue of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of unknown date. Although the cause of death was unknown, the victim had not suffocated or drowned. However, the coroner was unable to exclude haemorrhaging as the cause of death.

Besides the uterus being absent, the left lung had severe pleurisy; nothing was found to indicate that the victim had borne children; the heart was healthy and the right lung, liver, stomach, kidneys and spleen were normal. She had been dead for around six weeks to two months and had fair skin and dark hair. Furthermore, the condition of the hand recovered suggested the decedent was not an individual who was accustomed to manual labour.
==Popular culture==
The board game &quot;Whitehall Mystery&quot; (published in 2017 by Fantasy Flight Games) is based on the case. Players represent either the police (cooperating to hunt and arrest the murderer) or the culprit (who tries to evade the police and reach three locations on the board – a map of London).

It has become a point of trivia and irony that Scotland Yard, arguably the world&#x27;s best-known police building, was originally built (it later moved to a new location) on a crime scene related to an unsolved murder.

<doc id="876668" wikidata="Q6195984" url="?curid=876668" title="Jim Kaat">
<text>James Lee Kaat (; born November 7, 1938), nicknamed &quot;Kitty&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player and television sports commentator. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a left-handed pitcher for the Washington Senators / Minnesota Twins (–), Chicago White Sox (–), Philadelphia Phillies (–), New York Yankees (–), and St. Louis Cardinals (–). His playing career spanned 25 years.

Kaat was an All-Star for three seasons and a Gold Glove winner for 16 seasons. He was the American League (AL) leader in shutouts (5) in 1962, and the AL leader in wins (25) and complete games (19) in 1966. In addition to his 283 career wins, he has three 20-win seasons. Kaat won 190 games with the Senators/Twins (winning all but one with the latter), second most in club history and most since the team moved to Minnesota; he also has the most Gold Glove Awards of any Twin with 12.

After a brief stint as a pitching coach for the Cincinnati Reds, Kaat became a sportscaster and for the next 22 years called games for the New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins. Following a brief retirement in 2006, Jim Kaat was back in the broadcast booth calling Pool D for the 2009 World Baseball Classic in Puerto Rico, called games for NESN in 2009, and worked for the MLB Network from its inception in 2009 until August 2022.

Kaat was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Golden Days Era Committee as a part of the class of .

==Early life==
Kaat was the youngest of four children born to John and Nancy (Bosma) Kaat. He attended the schools of Zeeland, Michigan, and is a 1956 graduate of Zeeland High School. During his high school years, he excelled at basketball and baseball. 

Kaat attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, and pitched for the school&#x27;s Flying Dutchmen baseball team, before being signed by the Washington Senators as an amateur free agent in 1957.

==Baseball career==
Kaat spent all of 1957 and 1958 in the minor leagues before breaking into the majors in 1959. After pitching in 16 games spread out over the next two seasons, Kaat became a permanent member of the pitching staff when the team moved west in 1961 to become the Minnesota Twins. On July 24, 1963, Kaat threw a complete-game shutout and hit a home run for a 5–0 Twins win over the Indians. Minnesota pitchers have only homered in the same game in which they threw a shutout three times, and Kaat did so twice; the second occurrence was on October 1, 1970.

On July 23, 1964, he gave up two home runs to Bert Campaneris, who was making his major league debut in the game. Kaat was a member of the 1965 Twins team that won the American League pennant. He started three games in the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, matching up with Sandy Koufax on all three occasions, including a complete game victory in Game 2.

His best season was in 1966, when he led the league with 25 wins and 19 complete games. He finished fifth in the MVP voting and was named the American League Pitcher of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. The National League&#x27;s Sandy Koufax won the Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote; it was the last year in which only one award was given for all of Major League Baseball. Although his 1967 season was somewhat of a let down compared to 1966 (he finished 16–13 with a 3.04 ERA), he went on a tear in September and nearly pitched the Twins to another World Series appearance — cruising to a 7–0 record with a 1.51 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 65 innings pitched. However Kaat sustained a season-ending arm injury in the third inning of the second-to-last game of the season and the Boston Red Sox swept the final two games to win the American League pennant.

In 1974, he set a record for largest gap between 20-win seasons at eight, a mark not surpassed until David Cone broke the mark in 1998. Kaat recorded his third 20-win season in 1975, when he pitched to a 20–14 record with a 3.11 ERA. This was also the only year of his career in which he received votes for the Cy Young Award, finishing fourth. Although Kaat would pitch a few games a year out of the bullpen over the course of his career, he was primarily a starting pitcher until 1979, when he became a relief pitcher in a season which he split between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. He had been traded with Mike Buskey from the Chicago White Sox to the Phillies for Dick Ruthven, Alan Bannister and Roy Thomas on December 10, 1975. With the St. Louis Cardinals in 1982, Kaat earned his only World Series ring, working in four games out of the bullpen in the 1982 World Series.

Kaat was an All-Star three times (1962, 1966, 1975), and won the Gold Glove Award for defensive skill a record 16 consecutive times (1962–1977). His record for career Gold Gloves by a pitcher is now second to Greg Maddux&#x27;s 18. Kaat used the same baseball glove for 15 seasons.

In 1983, he became the last major league player to have played in the 1950s and the last player for the original Washington Senators to retire. Kaat is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades. At the time of his retirement, Kaat&#x27;s 25-year career was the longest of any pitcher in major league history. He is now third all-time, behind Nolan Ryan&#x27;s 27 seasons and Tommy John&#x27;s 26 campaigns. Kaat also set a 20th-century record by playing during the administrations of seven U.S. Presidents — Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jr., Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. This mark was equaled by Nolan Ryan when he retired after the 1993 season, the first year of the administration of Bill Clinton.

===Career statistics===
== Post-baseball activities ==
=== Coaching ===
Upon retirement as a player, Kaat served a short stint with the Cincinnati Reds as the club&#x27;s pitching coach. When Pete Rose took over in 1984 as the Reds&#x27; player/manager, he made good on a promise to Kaat, his former Philadelphia Phillies teammate, and hired the former hurler for his coaching staff. Kaat would coach part of the 1984 season and all of 1985, a year in which he guided Cincinnati rookie Tom Browning to a 20–9 record. &quot;At least I can say I had a 20-game winner every year I coached,&quot; Kaat used to joke.

===Other roles===
In January 2018, Jim Kaat was hired by the Minnesota Twins as a Special Assistant. Kaat&#x27;s role is &quot;to help assist Twins president Dave St. Peter in business, marketing and community initiatives&quot;.

Kaat had his number 36 retired by the Twins on July 16, 2022.

He has written a best-selling book, &quot;Still Pitching&quot;, and has started a sports management company, Southpaw Enterprises, Inc., solely representing pitchers. Kaat was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame in 2001.

In May 2022, Kaat released his third book, &quot;Good as Gold: My Eight Decades in Baseball&quot;.

===Baseball Hall of Fame===
In 2014, Kaat appeared for the second time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Golden Era Committee election ballot for possible Hall of Fame consideration for 2015, which required 12 votes. He missed getting inducted by two votes. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2021, and was formally enshrined on July 24, 2022.

==Broadcasting career==
=== Early broadcasting career ===
As was stated during the television broadcast of the seventh game of the 1965 World Series, Kaat was a broadcaster on local radio in Minnesota. Following his stint as pitching coach, he went into sports broadcasting full-time starting out as the chief baseball correspondent for &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from 1984–85.

His first full-time broadcasting job was with the Yankees was during the 1986 season, where he called around 100 games for WPIX. He only lasted one season as the Yankees replaced him with Billy Martin, who was between managing stints and who was purposely brought in to second-guess Lou Piniella. In between broadcasting stints for the Yankees, he spent six years (–) as an announcer for the Twins.

In 1986, Kaat was the backup announcer for NBC Sports&#x27; coverage of baseball with Phil Stone (for the April 19 Minnesota–California contest) and Jay Randolph (the July 14 Cincinnati–Atlanta contest). In 1988, he covered the College World Series and the MLB playoffs and World Series for ESPN and also served as an analyst for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics.

=== 1990s ===
From –, Kaat served as an analyst for CBS television, teaming with Dick Stockton and then, Greg Gumbel (for whom Kaat also called the College World Series with for CBS from 1990–1993) in . Besides calling four American League Championship Series for CBS (1990–1993), Kaat served as a field reporter with Lesley Visser (1990–1992) and Andrea Joyce (1991) during the World Series. Kaat also covered three World Series Trophy presentations for CBS (1990–1992). Over the course of Game 2 of the 1992 ALCS, Kaat was stricken with a bad case of laryngitis. As a result, Johnny Bench had to come over from the CBS Radio booth and finish the game with Dick Stockton as a &quot;relief analyst&quot;. There was talk that if Kaat&#x27;s laryngitis did not get better, Don Drysdale was going to replace Kaat on TV for Game 3 and possibly the rest of ALCS while Bench would continue to work on CBS Radio. In 1993, he filled in for Lesley Visser until late August as CBS&#x27; primary field reporter after she suffered injuries in a bizarre jogging accident in New York City&#x27;s Central Park.

In 1994, he was the lead analyst on &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; for ESPN&#x27;s coverage of Major League Baseball. In 1995, he was nominated for a New York Emmy Award for &quot;On Camera Achievement&quot;. Also in , Kaat called the American League playoffs with Brent Musburger for ABC/The Baseball Network including the Yankees–Seattle Mariners Division Series and the American League Championship Series.

He served his second stint as an announcer for Yankees games on the MSG Network/YES Network (–), where his straight-shooting style was much in the mode of former Yankees broadcasters Tony Kubek and Bill White. In addition, he was on the team which won the &quot;Outstanding Live Sports Coverage – Single Program&quot; New York Emmy for covering Dwight Gooden&#x27;s no-hitter on May 14, 1996 and David Wells&#x27;s perfect game on May 17, 1998.

=== 21st century ===
Towards the end of his second stint with the Yankees, his workload decreased. In 2006, he only broadcast 65 games. Despite his decreased workload, Kaat won another Emmy for on-air achievement in 2006.

In an on-air broadcast on September 10, , with booth partner Ken Singleton, Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance in the booth was to be a Yankee–Red Sox game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed due to rain. Kaat later announced that he was going to record a special farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first game of Saturday September 16&#x27;s doubleheader on Fox along with Tim McCarver and Josh Lewin. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to the Yankee fans, an opportunity that the previous night&#x27;s rainout had deprived him of doing on the YES Network.

After his retirement from calling Yankees games full-time, Kaat has made several single-game appearances on various networks. Kaat made a special one-inning appearance, during the third inning, on the YES Network on June 30, 2008 during a Yankees–Rangers game. He also appeared live via telephone, during a Yankees–Blue Jays game on July 13, 2008, to discuss the recent death of Bobby Murcer. He joined the &quot;TBS Sunday Baseball&quot; team, for a single game on May 4, .

In , Kaat joined the recently launched MLB Network as a color commentator for their &quot;MLB Network Showcase&quot; series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees (YES) Network, Kaat&#x27;s Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, urged him to get back into the game. He also called Pool D in Puerto Rico for the 2009 World Baseball Classic games for an international feed.

Kaat broadcast the 2021 American League Division Series between the White Sox and Astros for MLB Network. During Game 2, he attempted to make a joke, saying that the team should &quot;get a 40-acre field full of them&quot; in reference to White Sox third baseman Yoán Moncada, who is Cuban. The comment evoked an unfulfilled promise during the Reconstruction era of 40 acres and a mule to freed slaves. Kaat apologized later in the broadcast for his &quot;insensitive, hurtful remark&quot;. On June 2, 2022, Kaat again made headlines when he referred to New York Yankees pitcher Nestor Cortés Jr. as &quot;Nestor the Molester&quot; during a broadcast. The next day, Cortés tweeted about Kaat, &quot;He reached out to me and apologized for his remark last night, but he didn&#x27;t need to. We all make mistakes and feel 100% there was no malice intended.&quot;

After a four decade broadcasting career, Kaat announced his retirement on August 18, 2022 effective after that day&#x27;s Yankees-Blue Jays game.

Kaat married his fourth wife, Margie, in 2009.

Kaat&#x27;s grandparents were born in the Netherlands. They hailed from Zeeland, and Kaat grew up in Zeeland, Michigan.

During the offseason, Kaat resides in Stuart, Florida.

<text>Emma Elizabeth Smith ( 1843 – 4 April 1888) was a murder victim of mysterious origins in late-19th century London. Her killing was the first of the Whitechapel murders, and it is possible she was a victim of the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, though this is considered unlikely by most modern authors.

==Life==
Smith&#x27;s life prior to her murder in 1888 remains mysterious. Police files were gathered during the investigation, but most of these are missing, apparently taken, mislaid or discarded from the Metropolitan Police archive before the transfer of papers to the Public Record Office. In the surviving records, Inspector Edmund Reid notes a &quot;son and daughter living in Finsbury Park area&quot;. Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote:
At the time of her death in 1888, Smith had lived in a lodging-house at 18 George Street (since renamed Lolesworth Street), Spitalfields, in the East End of London for approximately eighteen months, paying 4d for a bed.

==Murder==
Prior to being fatally assaulted, Smith was last seen by fellow resident, 54-year-old Margaret Hayes, at 18 George Street, at approximately 12:15 a.m. on Tuesday, 3 April 1888, the day after the Easter Monday bank holiday. According to Hayes, Smith was standing near Farrant Street, talking with a man dressed in dark clothing and a white scarf. She is believed to have been attacked at the junction of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, approximately 75 minutes later. The location of this assault was approximately 300 yards from her lodging house. She survived the attack and, although injured, managed to walk back to her lodging house.

Upon her return to her lodging house, Smith told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of whom was a teenager. Mrs Russell and one of the other lodgers, Annie Lee, took Smith to the London Hospital, where she was treated by house surgeon George Haslip. She fell into a coma and died at 9 a.m. the following day. Medical investigation by the duty surgeon, Dr G. H. Hillier, revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. The police were not informed of the incident until 6 April when they were told an inquest was to be held the next day. The inquest at the hospital, which was conducted by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, was attended by Russell, Hillier, and the local chief inspector of the Metropolitan Police Service, H Division Whitechapel: John West. The inquest jury returned a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown.

Chief Inspector West placed the investigation in the hands of Inspector Edmund Reid of H Division. Reid noted in his report that her clothing was &quot;in such dirty ragged condition that it was impossible to tell if any part of it had been fresh torn&quot;. Walter Dew later described the investigation:

Smith had not provided descriptions of the men who had attacked her and no witnesses came forward or were found. The investigation proved fruitless and the murderer or murderers were never caught.

==Whitechapel murders==
The case was listed as the first of eleven Whitechapel murders in Metropolitan Police files. Although elements of the press linked her death to the later murders, which were blamed on a single serial killer known as &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings. With the exception of Walter Dew, who said he thought that Smith was the first victim of the Ripper, the police suspected it was the unrelated work of a criminal gang. Smith either refused to or could not describe her attackers in any form of detail, possibly because she feared reprisal. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation.

<text>Claudia Augusta (; January 63 – May 63) was the only daughter of the Roman Emperor Nero. She was born to the emperor&#x27;s second wife, the Empress Poppaea Sabina. Claudia and her mother were honored with the title of Augusta by Nero. She was born in Antium on 21 January 63 and later died five months after, of an unknown illness.

Nero and Poppaea Sabina mourned her death and Claudia was declared a goddess. Gold statues were placed in temples and circus games were held in Claudia&#x27;s honor while a shrine and a priest were dedicated to her shortly afterward.

<doc id="876695" wikidata="Q717251" url="?curid=876695" title="Alexius, Metropolitan of Kiev">
<text>Alexius (, &quot;Aleksii&quot;; before 1296–1378) was Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; (from 1354) and presided over the Moscow government during Dmitrii Donskoi&#x27;s minority.

==Biography==

Alexius, whose name at birth was Eleutherius, was a son of Фе­о­до­р (Theodore) Biakont and Mary, his father was a boyar from Chernigov who settled in Moscow and founded the Pleshcheev boyar family. He took monastic vows at the Epiphany Monastery of Moscow around 1313, at which time he was given the religious name of Alexius. In 1333 or so, he joined the household of Metropolitan Theognostus. In 1340, Alexius was appointed the metropolitan&#x27;s deputy in Vladimir and twelve years later was consecrated as Bishop of Vladimir.

By the will of Symeon the Proud, Alexius was appointed adviser to his brothers – Ivan and Andrew. After visiting Constantinople, he was chosen to become the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; in 1354. When Dmitry Donskoy and Vladimir the Bold were young, Alexius was their spiritual tutor and served as regent at the same time. He took the side of Dmitrii Donskoi in his struggle against Tver and Nizhny Novgorod, where he once sent Sergius of Radonezh to suspend service in churches and monasteries, until the political strife was over.

In 1357, Alexius was summoned by Jani Beg, the Khan of the Golden Horde, to cure his mother Taydula Khatun of blindness. The metropolitan&#x27;s success is held to have prevented a Tatar raid on Moscow.

In 1360s, Alexius founded the Andronikov, Chudov, and Alekseyevsky monasteries. He promoted Metropolitan Peter&#x27;s canonization by the Russian Orthodox Church. Shortly before his death, Alexius fruitlessly tried to convince Sergius of Radonezh to become his . Alexius was an author of a number of sermons and epistles. He was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1448 and is revered as one of the patron saints of Moscow.

== Feast days ==
12 February, (the day of his repose), 20 May, (the day of the uncovering of his relics) and 5 October, (Synaxis of the Hierarchs of Moscow). His relics are venerated in Ephiphany Cathedral in Elokhovo.

==Popular culture==
The 2012 film The Horde is a highly fictionalised narrative of how Alexius healed Taidula from blindness.

<doc id="876704" wikidata="Q12005038" url="?curid=876704" title="Tabu Records">
<text>Tabu Productions was an American record label founded by Clarence Avant in 1975. It focused on R&amp;B and funk.

==History==
Avant founded the label after Sussex Records went out of business in June 1975. Tabu Record&#x27;s flagship release, &quot;Stormin&#x27;&quot; by Brainstorm, was released in 1977. Tabu Records had a short-lived distribution pact with RCA, which lasted a year before moving to CBS Records.

The label focused on R&amp;B and funk but expanded into other genres such as jazz and disco. Its artists included the Argentine composer and pianist Lalo Schifrin, who composed and scored theme songs for numerous television series, including &quot;&quot;, and released two projects on Tabu (&quot;No One Home&quot;, 1979) and the S.O.S. Band (&quot;Take Your Time (Do It Right),&quot; 1980) Jazz singer Sharon Ridley (Full Moon), pianist Manfredo Fest.

Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis were hired to produce the S.O.S. Band&#x27;s fourth studio album for Tabu, &quot;On the Rise&quot; (1983), which was certified gold on January 16, 1984. While recording in S.O.S.&#x27;s home stomping grounds in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 24, 1983, a freak snowstorm hit, grounding all flights from the city. The duo was scheduled to perform as a part of the Time in San Antonio at the Hemisfair Arena that night but couldn&#x27;t make it. Subsequently, Prince, who owned and managed the Time, fired them on April 18, 1983. The duo stayed in Los Angeles and became songwriter-producers for artists like New Edition, Boyz II Men and most notably, Janet Jackson.

Working with Jam and Lewis gave Tabu a much-needed shot in the arm. They brought Cherrelle and Alexander O&#x27;Neal (the original Time lead vocalist) to the label and both did well; O&#x27;Neal released his self-titled studio album in 1985, and Cherrelle&#x27;s &quot;Fragile&quot; hit the American R&amp;B charts in 1984. The SOS Band had more hits with &quot;Just The Way You Like It&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Sands of Time&quot; in 1986, the album of which was certified gold on April 6, 1987. So influential was the sound that Robert Palmer covered Cherrelle&#x27;s &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Mean to Turn You On&quot; in 1986, and Beats International covered the S.O.S. Band&#x27;s &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot; in 1990. In 1985, Cherrelle and Alexander O&#x27;Neal dueted on &quot;Saturday Love,&quot; which was a hit in the UK but caught on later with American radio. Other acts like Kid Fire and Demetrius Perry recorded on this label.

==Sony era==
Tabu Records, in its deal with CBS, became associated with Sony Music Entertainment in November 1987 when the Japanese group bought CBS Records. During this period, Tabu released &quot;Diamonds in the Raw&quot; (1989) by the S.O.S. Band, which performed disappointingly. In 1991, Alexander O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s &quot;All True Man&quot; was the last album Tabu Records released under the new Sony regime.

==A&amp;M era==
In 1991, the label resurfaced under PolyGram&#x27;s A&amp;M Records, who distributed it from 1991 until 1993, releasing four albums and about 20 singles. Avant was hired to run Motown (another PolyGram label), and, in August 1993, he brought Tabu Records under its aegis. It released collections by the S.O.S. Band, Alexander O&#x27;Neal and Cherelle, while signing other artists such as Lucky Dube and Identity Crisis. However, this reappearance was short-lived as well.

In 1999, Seagram bought PolyGram and merged it with the MCA family of labels, which became Universal Music Group. Shortly after, Tabu Records was absorbed into A&amp;M Records.

==Re-issues==
In 2002, Avant brought Tabu Records to EMI&#x27;s reissue label the Right Stuff, which began to re-release Tabu Record&#x27;s catalogue.

In 2012, Demon Music Group announced it acquired the licensing rights of the Tabu Records catalogue. The company announced the news on Facebook on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2013 and released a trailer of the label&#x27;s return on YouTube. The licensing agreements come with reissues of the entire catalog on compact disc as well as digital download and Vinyl. The Tabu catalogue of Alexander O&#x27;Neal and Cherrelle were made available on iTunes in Fall 2012.

Greatest-hits albums by the S.O.S. Band, Cherelle, and Alexander O’Neal were released through Universal Music, as part of its Icon series, during 2012.

<text>Tilt-up, tilt-slab or tilt-wall is a type of building and a construction technique using concrete. Though it is a cost-effective technique with a shorter completion time, poor performance in earthquakes has mandated significant seismic retrofit requirements in older buildings.

With the tilt-up method, concrete elements (walls, columns, structural supports, etc.) are formed horizontally on a concrete slab; this normally requires the building floor as a building form but may be a temporary concrete casting surface near the building footprint. After the concrete has cured, the elements are &quot;tilted&quot; to the vertical position with a crane and braced into position until the remaining building structural components (roofs, intermediate floors and walls) are secured.

Tilt-up construction is a common method of construction throughout North America, several Caribbean nations, Australia, and New Zealand. It is not significantly used in Europe or the northern two thirds of Asia. It is gaining popularity in southern Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, Central and South America.

Concrete elements can also be formed at factories away from the building site. Tilt-up differs from prefabrication, or plant cast construction, in that all elements are constructed on the job site. This eliminates the size limitation imposed by transporting elements from a factory to the project site.

==Construction==

Tilt-up construction requires significant organization and collaboration on the building site. The chronological steps that need to be taken for a tilt-up project are: site evaluation, engineering, footings and floor slabs, forming tilt-up panels, steel placement, embeds and inserts, concrete placement, panel erection and panel finishing. Once the pad (casting surface or floor slab) has cured, forms are built on top. Dimensional lumber, a high quality plywood or fiber board that has at least one smooth face is typically used, although aluminum or steel forms are also common. Carpenters work from engineered drawings designed for each panel or element to construct on site. They incorporate all door and window openings, as well as architectural features and other desired shapes that can be molded into the concrete. Studs, gussets and attachment plates are located within the form for embedding in the concrete. The forms are usually anchored to the casting surface with masonry nails or otherwise adhered to prevent damage to the floor slab.

Next, a chemically reactive bondbreaker is sprayed on the form&#x27;s surfaces to prevent the cast concrete from bonding with the slab. This allows the cast element to separate from the casting surface once it has cured. This is a critical step, as improper chemical selection or application will prevent the lifting of the panels, and will entail costly demolition and rework.

A rebar grid is constructed inside the forms, after the form release is applied, spaced off the casting surface the desired distance with plastic &quot;chairs&quot;. The rebar size and spacing is generally specified by the engineer of record.

Concrete is then poured, filling the desired thickness and surrounding all steel inserts, embedded features and rebar. The concrete is then settled through vibration to prevent any voids or honeycomb effects. The forms are removed when the concrete is cured; rigging is attached and a crane tilts the panel or lifts the element into place. In circumstances when space is at a premium, concrete elements can be cast one on top of the other, or stack cast. Quite often a separate casting pad is poured for this purpose and is removed when the panels are erected.

Cranes are used to tilt the concrete elements from the casting slab to a vertical position. The slabs are then most often set onto a foundation and secured with braces until the structural steel and the roof diaphragm is in place.

==Structure==
Concrete tilt-up walls can be very heavy, sometimes over . Most tilt-up wall panels are engineered to work with the roof structure and/or floor structures to resist all forces; that is, to function as load-bearing walls. The connections to the roof and floors are usually steel plates with headed studs that were secured into the forms prior to concrete placement. These attachment points are bolted or welded. The upper attachment points are made to the roof trusses. Interior walls may be present for additional stiffness in the building structure as necessary, known as shear walls.

Insulation can be applied to either side of the panels or cast as an integral part of the panel between two layers of concrete to create sandwich panels. Concrete has the ability to absorb and store energy and is high mass, which regulates interior temperature (thermal mass) and provides soundproofing and durability.

Like all concrete construction, tilt-up buildings are fire-resistant. In addition, wall panels can be designed to sag inward when damaged, which minimizes collapse (this can also be done with prefabricated panels).

==Uses==
Tilt-up was first used in America circa 1905. In 1908 Robert Akin patented the tilt-slab method of concrete construction used in the construction of the Schindler House. Early erection was done using tilt tables, but the development of the mobile crane and truck mixers allowed tilt-up construction to grow. Tilt-up gained widespread popularity in the post World War II construction boom. Tilt-up was not used successfully in Australia until 1969.

Most early tilt-up buildings were warehouses. Today the method is used in nearly every type of building from schools to office structures, houses to hotels. They range from single story to more than seven and can be more than 29 metres (96 feet) in height.

An early example of this method is found in the innovative Schindler House, built in 1922 in West Hollywood, California. Architect Rudolf Schindler claimed that with the assistance of a small hand-operated crane, just two workmen were needed to raise and attach the tilt-up walls.

The first tilt-up built home in Ontario, Canada was built in 2017.

==Appearance==
Early tilt-up architecture was very minimalist and boxy. Recent techniques have expanded the range of appearance and shape.

Many finish options are available to the tilt-up contractor, from paints and stains to pigmented concrete, cast-in features like brick and stone to aggressive erosion finishes like sandblasting and acid-etching. Shapes are also a feature that have become dominant in the tilt-up market, with many panels configured with circular or elliptical openings, panel tops that are pedimented or curved, facades that are curved or segmented and featured with significant areas of glazing or other materials.

==Association==
The Tilt-Up Concrete Association (TCA) is the international trade association for tilt-up concrete construction. TCA is a membership-based association, with nearly 500 members worldwide. TCA members can be contractors (general contractors or tilt-up subcontractors), engineers, architects, developers, consultants, suppliers, specialty trade firms, educators and students.

TCA offers primarily educational, networking and exposure benefits to its members. TCA also offers an Achievement Awards program annually, recognizing the best examples of tilt-up construction over a variety of end uses.

==Risks==
In the wake of the 2011 Joplin tornado in which seven people were killed in a Home Depot when the panel walls collapsed after the store was hit by an EF5 tornado, engineers in an article published in &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; criticized the practice. They said that once one wall falls, it creates a domino effect. Twenty-eight people in an un-reinforced training room in the back of the building survived. According to a study of the collapse, the tornado hit the south corner of the store and lifted the roof up causing the west walls to collapse into the store. The walls on the east side (where the people survived) collapsed out. Only two walls remained standing. Engineers said that stronger roof-to-wall connections might have tempered the collapse. Two other big box stores at the corner that had concrete block construction (an Academy Sports + Outdoors and Walmart) lost their roofs but the walls remained intact. Those buildings were not directly hit by the tornado but the Home Depot building suffered a direct hit. Three people died in the Walmart, but 200 survived. The engineers told the Star that when concrete blocks fail they usually break apart, and do not come down in huge slabs. Home Depot, which has hundreds of stores built with tilt-up, said it disagreed with the finding and that it would use tilt-up when it rebuilt the Joplin store.

Shortly after publication of the Kansas City Star article, the technical committee of the Tilt-Up Concrete Association (TCA) formed a task force to investigate the claims presented in the article. With the cooperation of Home Depot, the task group performed detailed engineering calculations, research and investigation of the claims posed in the article. This task force consisted of a nationwide group of practicing structural engineers with a diverse range of experience in tilt-up construction and &quot;big box&quot; buildings. The final report was published on January 12, 2012. &quot;The information provided in these findings will help Association efforts to promote the benefits of site cast Tilt-Up construction and dispute many of the claims presented in The Kansas City Star article.&quot;

===Findings of the Task Force===
One of the conclusions of the Task Force&#x27;s report was &quot;Recommend to ICC and direct
to building owners the use of storm shelters in lieu of designing buildings for high
winds. The TCA should develop specific Tilt-Up based storm shelter designs for winds
of up to 200 MPH that would compete against alternative masonry, precast, or
cast-in-place designs. Storm shelter design is addressed in 2009 IBC, section 423 and ICC-500.&quot;

<doc id="876707" wikidata="Q6691539" url="?curid=876707" title="Love You Forever">
<text>Love You Forever is a 1986 children&#x27;s picture book written by Robert Munsch and illustrated by Sheila McGraw. The story centers on a mother who sings a lullaby to her son at each stage of his life. During his childhood, she becomes frustrated with his rebellious nature, yet always sings to him after he falls asleep. The mother and son grow older, with the former becoming sick due to old age, and one day unable to sing the lullaby. The son sings the song for her, then sings it to his newborn daughter.

==Plot==
The story details the cycle of life by chronicling the experiences of a young son and his mother throughout the course of the boy&#x27;s life and describing the frustrating behavior exhibited by him throughout his youth. 

Despite her occasional aggravation caused by her son&#x27;s behavior at 2 years old, 9 years old, and as a teenager, the mother nonetheless visits his bedroom nightly to cradle him in her arms, and sing a brief lullaby promising to always love him:

&quot;I&#x27;ll love you forever&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ll like you for always&quot;

&quot;As long as I&#x27;m living&quot;

&quot;My baby you&#x27;ll be&quot;

After her son enters adulthood and moves across town, his elderly mother occasionally sneaks into his bedroom at night to croon her customary lullaby. 

However, she gradually grows old and frail, and her grown son visits his feeble, sickly mother for the final time. 

When the son first arrives, his mother tries to sing her lullaby to him, but she is too weak to finish. The son then cradles his mother in his arms and sings the lullaby for her in reciprocation for the unconditional love that she had shown him throughout his life, changing the last line to &quot;my mommy you&#x27;ll be.&quot; 

After returning home, the son pauses at the top of the stairs for a long moment (perhaps grieving the death of his mother). He then goes into the nursery, cradles his newborn daughter, and sings his mother&#x27;s signature lullaby for her, implying that the cycle will continue. 

==Creation==

The book was written after Munsch and his wife had two stillborn babies. It began as a song that Munsch would sing in his head for his two babies as singing it out loud was too emotional. During a performance at a theatre in the University of Guelph, the short song turned into a full story that was later published as a book.
Munsch and his wife have since adopted three children.

==Reception==
&quot;Love You Forever&quot; was listed fourth on the 2001 &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; All-Time Bestselling Children&#x27;s Books list for paperbacks at 6,970,000 copies (not including the 1,049,000 hardcover copies). In 2001, Maria Shriver wrote in &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;: &quot;I have yet to read this book through without crying. It says so much about the circle of life, youth, parenting, and our responsibility for our parents as we grow older. The message is so simple yet so profound. &quot;Love You Forever&quot; is a great gift for anyone with a child, or even for your own parents.&quot; Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children.&quot;

Some readers dislike the portion of the story where the mother sneaks into her grown son&#x27;s home. One &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewer states that &quot;Love You Forever&quot; is a divisive children&#x27;s book. &quot;Either it moves you to tears and you love it, or it makes your skin crawl and you detest it...&quot; A commentator wrote &quot;it&#x27;s either a touching account of a mother&#x27;s unending love or the ultimate helicopter parenting gone bad.&quot;

==Media appearances==
The book is prominently featured in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with the Cake&quot;. In the episode, Joey performs a dramatic reading of the book at Emma&#x27;s first birthday (as he had forgotten to get a present and saw the book nearby), moving everyone to tears. Joey later realizes that he has forgotten to prepare for an upcoming audition and decides to recite the book as a dramatic monologue.

The book was read by Madeleine Stowe to Tori Barban in the movie &quot;The Christmas Hope&quot;, the third movie in &quot;The Christmas Shoes&quot; trilogy.

Playwright Topher Payne wrote an alternative ending to the story, in which the mother is forced to recognize the son&#x27;s need for personal space, and they instead agree to share their time doing things together.

In the season eleven episode “Decision Time” of the tv series Heartland, Amy reads the book to her baby.

In the &quot;Manifest&quot; episode &quot;All-Call,&quot; Eden is briefly shown reading the book.

In &quot;Savage Dragon&quot; issue 120, Dragon reads the book to Angel Murphy; both characters express disapproval of its content, and in a subsequent issue&#x27;s letter column, both a letter-writer and series creator Erik Larsen refer to the book as &quot;creepy&quot;.

<text>Robert Clayton Shantz (born September 26, 1925) is an American former professional baseball left-handed pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from through , and won the 1952 American League Most Valuable Player Award as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics. A three-time All-Star, Shantz won eight consecutive Gold Glove Awards and won a World Series championship with the 1958 New York Yankees. He is the last living Philadelphia Athletics player, the oldest living MLB MVP, and the only living player who debuted in MLB in the 1940s.

He also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Houston Colt .45s, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, and the Philadelphia Phillies. Shantz began his career as a starting pitcher, but about halfway through he converted to a competent relief pitcher. In 1951, he added the knuckleball to his repertoire. Standing only , Shantz had a career record of 119 games won, 99 games lost, and an earned run average (ERA) of 3.38.

==Career==
Shantz graduated from Pottstown High School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in 1943. He signed with the Philadelphia Athletics as a free agent and made his MLB debut in 1949. In 1952, Shantz led the American League (AL) in wins (24) and won the AL Most Valuable Player Award. In the process, he led the A&#x27;s to a 79–75 record and fourth-place finish in the American League, their last winning season in Philadelphia. In a September 1952 game, Shantz&#x27;s left wrist was broken after he was hit by a pitch thrown by Walt Masterson of the Senators. The following season, Shantz injured his shoulder in a game against the Boston Red Sox. Shantz saw only limited action for the rest of 1953 and pitched only eight innings in 1954. After the 1954 season was complete, the Athletics were sold and moved to Kansas City for the 1955 season.

On February 19, 1957, the Athletics traded Shantz, Art Ditmar, Wayne Belardi, Jack McMahan, and players to be named later (PTBNL) to the New York Yankees for Rip Coleman, Milt Graff, Billy Hunter, Mickey McDermott, Irv Noren, Tom Morgan, and a PTBNL. The Yankees sent Jack Urban to the Athletics and the Athletics sent Curt Roberts and Clete Boyer to the Yankees to complete the trade. He led the league in ERA in his first year with the Yankees, but was never a regular starting pitcher afterwards.

A highly skilled fielder, Shantz won eight consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 1957 to 1964 (American League, 1957–60; National League, 1961–64; in 1957 the award was rendered for both leagues). Shantz also was selected for the All-Star Game in 1951, 1952 and 1957. In the fifth and final inning of the 1952 All Star Game, the left–handed Shantz exhibited his distinctive sidearm delivery and sharp curve and control and struck out three consecutive National League hitters: Whitey Lockman, Jackie Robinson and Stan Musial.

Shantz appeared in relief three games each in the 1957 and 1960 World Series with the Casey Stengel managed New York Yankees. Shantz was selected in the 1960 MLB expansion draft by the Washington Senators from the New York Yankees; the Senators then traded Shantz to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Bennie Daniels, Harry Bright, and R. C. Stevens. The Houston Colt .45s selected Shantz from the Pirates in the 1961 MLB expansion draft. On May 7, 1962, the Colt .45s traded Shantz to the St. Louis Cardinals for John Anderson and Carl Warwick.

On June 15, 1964, the Cardinals traded Shantz, Ernie Broglio, and Doug Clemens to the Chicago Cubs for Lou Brock, Jack Spring, and Paul Toth. The Cubs sold Shantz to the Philadelphia Phillies in August 1964. He retired after the 1964 season.

In his 16-year major league career, Shantz recorded a .195 batting average (107-for-548) with 60 runs, 20 doubles, one home run, 46 runs batted in and 47 walks. Defensively, he posted a .976 fielding percentage which was 19 points higher than the league average at his position.

==Personal life==
He is the brother of former Major League catcher Billy Shantz. He is married to Shirley Vogel, and they have four children, Bobby, born in 1954, followed by Kathy, Teddy, and Danny, born in 1965.

Shantz became the last surviving player who played under Connie Mack after the death of Bill Harrington in 2022, and the last living player to debut in MLB in the 1940s after the death of Tommy Brown in 2025. Following the death of Larry Miggins in December 12, 2023, Shantz became the third-oldest living MLB player.

<doc id="876719" wikidata="Q908600" url="?curid=876719" title="DPT vaccine">
<text>The DPT vaccine or DTP vaccine is a class of combination vaccines to protect 
against three infectious diseases in humans: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus (lockjaw). The vaccine components include diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and either killed whole cells of the bacterium that causes pertussis or pertussis antigens. The term toxoid refers to vaccines which use an inactivated toxin produced by the pathogen which they are targeted against to generate an immune response. In this way, the toxoid vaccine generates an immune response which is targeted against the toxin which is produced by the pathogen and causes disease, rather than a vaccine which is targeted against the pathogen itself. The whole cells or antigens will be depicted as either &quot;DTwP&quot; or &quot;DTaP&quot;, where the lower-case &quot;w&quot; indicates whole-cell inactivated pertussis and the lower-case &quot;a&quot; stands for &quot;acellular&quot;. In comparison to alternative vaccine types, such as live attenuated vaccines, the DTP vaccine does not contain any live pathogen, but rather uses inactivated toxoid (and for pertussis, either a dead pathogen or pure antigens) to generate an immune response; therefore, there is not a risk of use in populations that are immune compromised since there is not any known risk of causing the disease itself. As a result, the DTP vaccine is considered a safe vaccine to use in anyone and it generates a much more targeted immune response specific for the pathogen of interest.

In the United States, the DPT (whole-cell) vaccine was administered as part of the childhood vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) until 1996, when the acellular DTaP vaccine was licensed for use.

== History ==

Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTP; now also &quot;DTwP&quot; to differentiate from the broader class of triple-combination vaccines) vaccination was licensed in 1949. Since the introduction of the combination vaccine, there has been an extensive decline in the incidence of pertussis, or whooping cough, the disease which the vaccine protects against. Additionally, the rates of disease have continued to decline as more extensive immunization strategies have been implemented, including booster doses and increased emphasis on increasing health literacy.

In the 20th century, the advancements in vaccinations helped to reduce the incidence of childhood pertussis and had a dramatically positive effect on the health of populations in the United States. However, in the early 21st century, reported instances of the disease increased 20-fold due to a downturn in the number of immunizations received and resulted in numerous fatalities. During the 21st century, many parents declined to vaccinate their children against pertussis for fear of perceived side effects, despite scientific evidence showing vaccines to be highly effective and safe. In 2009, the journal &quot;Pediatrics&quot; concluded the largest risk among unvaccinated children was not the contraction of side effects, but rather the disease that the vaccination aims to protect against.

DTP vaccines with acellular pertussis (DTaP; see below) were introduced in the 1990s. The reduced range of antigens causes fewer side effects, but results in a more expensive, shorter-lasting, and possibly less protective vaccine compared to DTwP. High-income countries have mostly switched to DTaP. As of 2023, global production of aP remains limited.

=== Vaccination rates ===
In 2016, the CDC reported that 80.4% of children in the US had received four or more DTaP vaccinations by 2 years of life. Vaccination rates for children aged 13–17 with one or more TDaP shots was 90.2% in 2019. Only 43.6% of adults (older than 18) have received a TDaP shot in the last 10 years. The CDC aimed to increase vaccination rate among 2-year-olds from 80.4% to 90.0%

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 89% of people globally had received at least one dose of DTP vaccine and 84% had received three doses of the vaccine, completing the WHO-recommended primary series (DTP3). The WHO also tracks the DTP3 completion rate among one-year-olds on a yearly basis. Yearly DTP3 completion rate is considered a good proxy for the completeness of childhood vaccination in general.

== Combination vaccines with acellular pertussis ==

DTaP and Tdap are both combination vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The &quot;a&quot; indicates that the pertussis toxoids are acellular, while the lower-case &quot;d&quot; and &quot;p&quot; in &quot;Tdap&quot; indicate smaller concentrations of diphtheria toxoids and pertussis antigens.

=== DTaP ===

DTaP (also DTP and TDaP) is a combination vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, in which the pertussis component is acellular. This is in contrast to whole-cell, inactivated DTP (or DTwP). The acellular vaccine uses selected antigens of the pertussis pathogen to induce immunity. Because it uses fewer antigens than the whole-cell vaccines, it is considered to cause fewer side effects, but it is also more expensive. Research suggests that the DTwP vaccine is more effective than DTaP in conferring immunity, because DTaP&#x27;s narrower antigen base is less effective against current pathogen strains.

=== Tdap ===
Tdap (also TDP) is a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine. It was licensed in the United States for use in adults and adolescents on 10 June 2005. Two Tdap vaccines are available in the US. In January 2011, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the use of Tdap in adults of all ages, including those age 65 and above. In October 2011, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, the ACIP recommended that unvaccinated pregnant women receive a dose of Tdap. On 24 October 2012, the ACIP voted to recommend the use of Tdap during every pregnancy.

The ACIP and Canada&#x27;s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that both adolescents and adults receive Tdap in place of their next Td booster (recommended to be given every ten years). Tdap and Td can be used as prophylaxis for tetanus in wound management. People who will be in contact with young infants are encouraged to get Tdap even if it has been less than five years since Td or TT to reduce the risk of infants being exposed to pertussis. NACI suggests intervals shorter than five years can be used for catch-up programs and other instances where programmatic concerns make five-year intervals difficult.

The WHO recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining the DTP vaccine with vaccines against &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type B and hepatitis B. Evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is compared to the individual vaccines has not yet been determined.

A 2019 study found that state requirements mandating the use of the Tdap vaccine &quot;increased Tdap vaccine take-up and reduced pertussis (whooping cough) incidence by about 32%.&quot;

== Related combination vaccines ==

=== Excluding pertussis ===
DT and Td vaccines lack the pertussis component. The Td vaccine is administered to children over the age of seven as well as to adults. It is most commonly administered as a booster shot every 10 years. The Td booster shot may also be administered as protection from a severe burn or dirty wound. The DT vaccine is given to children under the age of seven who are unable to receive the pertussis antigen in the DTaP vaccine due to a contraindication.

=== Additional targets ===
In the United States, a combined inactivated polio (IPV), DTaP, and hepatitis B DTaP-IPV-HepB vaccine is available for children. In the UK, all babies born on or after 1 August 2017 are offered a hexavalent vaccine: DTaP, IPV, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and hepatitis B (DTaP-Hib-HepB-IPV in short).

As of 2023, most of the DTP vaccine procured by UNICEF is of the DTwP-HepB-Hib (pentavalent whole-cell) type. The UNICEF plans to procure the DTwP-HepB-Hib-IPV (hexavalent whole-cell) vaccine starting in 2024.

== Contraindications ==
The DPT vaccine should be avoided in persons who experienced a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to a past vaccine containing tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis. It should also be avoided in persons with a known severe allergy to an ingredient in the vaccine. If the reaction was caused by tetanus toxoids, the CDC recommends considering a passive immunization with tetanus immune globulin (TIG) if a person has a large or unclean wound. The DPT vaccine should also be avoided if a person developed encephalopathy (seizures, coma, declined consciousness) within seven days of receiving any pertussis-containing vaccine and the encephalopathy cannot be traced to another cause. A DT vaccine is available for children under the ages of seven who have contraindications or precautions to pertussis-containing vaccines.

== Side effects ==

=== DTaP ===
Common side effects include soreness where the shot was given, fever, irritability, tenderness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Most side effects are mild to moderate and may last from one to three days. More serious but rare reactions after a DTaP vaccination may include seizures, lowered consciousness, or a high fever over . Allergic reactions are uncommon, but are medical emergencies. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, dyspnea, wheezing, swelling of face and throat, syncope, and tachycardia and the child should be rushed to the nearest hospital.

=== Tdap ===
Common side effects include pain or swelling where the shot was given, mild fever, headache, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach ache. Allergic reactions are possible and have the same presentation and indications as described above for allergic reactions in DTaP. Any individual who has experienced a life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving a previous dose of diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis containing vaccine should not receive the Tdap vaccination.

In pregnant women, research suggests that Tdap administration may be associated with an increased risk of chorioamnionitis, a placental infection. Increased incidence of fever is also noted in pregnant women. Despite the observed increase in incidence of chorioamnionitis in pregnant women following Tdap administration, there has been no observed increase in the incidence of preterm birth, for which chorioamnionitis is a risk factor. Research has not discerned an association between Tdap administration during pregnancy and other serious pregnancy complications such as neonatal death and stillbirth. An association between Tdap administration during pregnancy and pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders (such as pre-eclampsia) has not been identified.

== Immunization schedules and requirements ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the DTP vaccine is part of the National Immunisation Program (NIP). The vaccine is administered to infants in a series of doses: the first three doses are given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, followed by a fourth dose at 18 months and a fifth dose at 4 years. Adolescents receive a single booster dose at 12-13 years.

Adults are recommended to receive a dTpa booster every 10 years, especially those in close contact with infants. Pregnant women are advised to receive a dTpa booster during each pregnancy, ideally between 20-32 weeks of gestation, to protect newborns from pertussis.

=== France ===
In France, children are given DTaP-Hib-HepB-IPV vaccines at 2 months (first dose) and 4 months (second dose) with a booster at 11 months of age. A tetravalent booster for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and poliomyelitis is given at 6 years, at 11–13 years, then at 25, 45, 65 years of age, then every 10 years.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, pertussis is known as &quot;kinkhoest&quot; and DKTP refers to the DTaP-IPV combination vaccine against diphtheria, kinkhoest, tetanus, and polio. DTaP is given as part of the National Immunisation Programme.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, Td/IPV is called the &quot;3-in-1 teenage booster&quot; and protects against tetanus, diphtheria and polio. It is given by the NHS to all teenagers aged 14 (the hexavalent vaccine is given to infants and provides the first stage of protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and polio, as well as pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type B and hepatitis B). Subsequent boosters are recommended for foreign travellers where more than 10 years has passed since their last booster. This is provided on the NHS free of charge due to the significant risk that an imported case of polio could pose to public health in Britain.

=== United States ===
The standard immunization regimen for children within the United States is five doses of DTaP between the ages of two months and fifteen years. To be considered fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) typically requires five doses of Tdap. The CDC recommends that children receive their first dose at two months, the second dose at four months, the third dose at six months, the fourth dose between 15 and 18 months, and the fifth dose between 4–6 years. If the fourth dose of the DTaP immunization regimen falls on or subsequent to the recipient&#x27;s fourth birthday, the CDC states that only four doses are required to be fully vaccinated. In the instance that an individual under 18 has not received the DTaP vaccine, individuals should be vaccinated on the schedule in accordance with the vaccination &quot;catch up schedule&quot; provided by the CDC.

Infants younger than twelve months of age, specifically less than three months of age, are at highest risk of acquiring pertussis. In U.S., there is no current tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination (whooping cough) recommended or licensed for new born infants. As a result, in their first few months of life, unprotected infants are at highest risk of life-threatening complications and infections from pertussis. Infants should not receive pertussis vaccination younger than six weeks of age. Ideally, Infants should receive DTaP (name of whooping cough vaccine for children from age 2 months through 6 years) at 2, 4, 6 months of age and they are not protected until the full series is completed. To protect infants younger than twelve months of age not vaccinated with Tdap against pertussis, ACIP also recommends adults (e.g., parents, siblings, grandparents, childcare providers, and healthcare personnel) and children to receive Tdap at least two weeks before being in contact with the infant.

The CDC recommends that adults who have received their childhood DTP series receive a Td or Tdap booster every ten years. For adults that have not received the DTP series, the CDC recommends a three-part vaccine series followed by a Td or Tdap booster every ten years.

==== In pregnancy ====
According to the CDC&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines, one dose of Tdap is recommended during each pregnancy to ensure protection against pertussis in newborn infants. Optimal timing to administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy is between 27 through 36 weeks gestation. If Tdap is administered early in pregnancy, it is not recommended to administer again during the 27 through 36 weeks gestation period as only one dose is recommended during pregnancy. In October 2022, Boostrix (Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed [Tdap]) was approved for immunization during the third trimester of pregnancy to prevent pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, in infants younger than two months of age.

Pregnant women who have not previously vaccinated with Tdap (i.e., have never received DTP, DTaP, or DT as child or Td or TT as an adult) are recommended to receive a series of three Td vaccinations starting during pregnancy to ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus. In such cases, administration of Tdap is recommended after 20 weeks&#x27; gestation, and in earlier pregnancy a single dose of Tdap can be substituted for one dose of Td, and then the series completed with Td. For pregnant women not previously vaccinated with Tdap, if Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, it should be administered immediately postpartum. Postpartum administration of TDaP is not equivalent to administration of the vaccination during pregnancy. Because the vaccine is administered postpartum, the mother is unable to develop antibodies that can be transferred to the infant in utero, consequently, leaving the infant vulnerable to the diseases preventable by the Tdap Vaccine. Postpartum administration of the TdaP vaccine to the mother seeks to reduce the likelihood that the mother will contract disease that can be subsequently passed on the infant, albeit there will still be a two-week period prior to the protective effects of the vaccine setting in. Postpartum administration is an extension of the concept of &quot;cocooning&quot;, a term that refers to the full vaccination of all individuals that may come into direct contact with the infant. Cocooning, like postpartum Tdap administration, is not recommended by the CDC. Cocooning depends on ensuring full vaccination of all individuals that the infant may come into contact with, and there may be financial, administrative or personal barriers that preclude full and timely vaccination of all individuals within the &quot;cocoon&quot;.

<text>This article details the various tables referenced in the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES) block cipher.

All bits and bytes are arranged in big endian order in this document. That is, bit number 1 is always the most significant bit.

==Initial permutation (IP)==
This table specifies the input permutation on a 64-bit block. The meaning is as follows: the first bit of the output is taken from the 58th bit of the input; the second bit from the 50th bit, and so on, with the last bit of the output taken from the 7th bit of the input.

This information is presented as a table for ease of presentation; it is a vector, not a matrix.

==Final permutation (IP−1)==
The final permutation is the inverse of the initial permutation; the table is interpreted similarly.

==Expansion function (E)==
The expansion function is interpreted as for the initial and final permutations. Note that some bits from the input are duplicated at the output; e.g. the fifth bit of the input is duplicated in both the sixth and eighth bit of the output. Thus, the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits.

==Permutation (P)==

The P permutation shuffles the bits of a 32-bit half-block.

==Permuted choice 1 (PC-1)==
The &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; halves of the table show which bits from the input key form the left and right sections of the key schedule state. Note that only 56 bits of the 64 bits of the input are selected; the remaining eight (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64) were specified for use as parity bits.

==Permuted choice 2 (PC-2)==
This permutation selects the 48-bit subkey for each round from the 56-bit key-schedule state. This permutation will ignore 8 bits below:

Permuted Choice 2 &quot;PC-2&quot; ignored bits 9, 18, 22, 25, 35, 38, 43, 54.

==Substitution boxes (S-boxes)==

This table lists the eight S-boxes used in DES. Each S-box replaces a 6-bit input with a 4-bit output. Given a 6-bit input, the 4-bit output is found by selecting the row using the outer two bits, and the column using the inner four bits. For example, an input &quot;011011&quot; has outer bits &quot;01&quot; and inner bits &quot;1101&quot;; noting that the first row is &quot;00&quot; and the first column is &quot;0000&quot;, the corresponding output for S-box S5 would be &quot;1001&quot; (=9), the value in the second row, 14th column. (See S-box).

==Key Generation==
The main key supplied from user is of 64 bits. The following operations are performed with it.

=== Drop Parity bits ===
Drop the bits of the grey positions (8x) to make 56 bit space for further operation for each round.

After that bits are permuted according to the following table,

The table is row major way, means,

Actual Bit position = Substitute with the bit of row * 8 + column.

=== Bits Rotation ===
Before the round sub-key is selected, each half of the key schedule state is rotated left by a number of places. This table specifies the number of places rotated.

• The key is divided into two 28-bit parts

• Each part is shifted left (circular) one or two bits

• After shifting, two parts are then combined to form a 56 bit temp-key again
=== Key Compression ===
• The compression P-box changes the 56 bits key to 48 bits key, which is used as a key for the corresponding round.

The table is row major way, means,

Actual Bit position = Substitute with the bit of row * 8 + column.
After this return the Round-Key of 48 bits to the called function, &quot;i.e.&quot; the Round.

<doc id="876722" wikidata="Q2344749" url="?curid=876722" title="Stephen Gould (tenor)">
<text>Stephen Grady Gould (January 24, 1962 – September 19, 2023) was an American heldentenor and leading interpreter of Richard Wagner&#x27;s stage works. He performed around 100 times at the Bayreuth Festival, notably as Tannhäuser starting in 2004, and later Siegfried and Tristan. In 2022, his performance in all three roles earned him nicknames such as Iron Man.

Gould appeared at leading opera houses worldwide. His non-Wagner repertoire included the roles of Paul in Korngold&#x27;s &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot;, Bacchus in Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, the title role of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, the Emperor in Strauss&#x27; &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, the title role of Verdi&#x27;s Otello, Aeneas in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, and the title role of William Bolcom&#x27;s &quot;McTeague&quot;. In concert, he performed in Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;, and Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Stephen Grady Gould was born in Roanoke, Virginia, on January 24, 1962, the son of Loren Gould, a Baptist minister, and Annie (née Brown), a pianist who taught at schools. Gould first studied as a baritone at Olivet Nazarene University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1984. He later studied at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston with John Moriarty, and then became a member of the Lyric Opera of Chicago Center for American Art.

In 1989, he stepped in for Chris Merritt at the Los Angeles Opera as Argirio in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Tancredi&quot;, alongside Marilyn Horne. Without a permanent operatic engagement, Gould auditioned for the first U.S. tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and was accepted, performing in male roles for over 3,000 performances.

=== Tenor ===
After leaving &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, Gould thought that his singing career was effectively over, until he met and began studying with John Fiorito, a voice teacher connected to the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, who completely reworked Gould&#x27;s vocal technique so he could sing heldentenor repertoire. On Fiorito&#x27;s advice, Gould temporarily abandoned performing and studied with Fiorito for three years in the evenings in conjunction with a day job. In January 2000, he first appeared in a heldentenor role at the Landestheater Linz as Florestan in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;. He was invited by Zubin Mehta to perform as Melot in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; at the Bavarian State Opera in 2001, in a production directed by Peter Konwitschny. In 2002, he appeared as Aeneas in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; by Berlioz at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino with Mehta, and a year later at the same festival as Verdi&#x27;s Otello. He performed his first leading Wagner role at the Landestheater Linz in 2002 as Tannhäuser.

==== Bayreuth ====
Gould first appeared at the Bayreuth Festival in 2004 as Tannhäuser, conducted by Christian Thielemann. In 2006 he performed at the festival in the role of Siegfried in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, staged by Tankred Dorst and conducted again by Thielemann. &quot;Tannhäuser&#x27;s character is more appropriate to me than Siegfried&quot;, said Gould to &quot;Forum Opéra&quot; in December 2007. He first performed as Tristan there in 2015, directed by Katharina Wagner and conducted by Thielemann. He appeared as Siegmund in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in 2018, and as Parsifal in a concert performance in 2021. Gould performed at the festival around 100 times in 20 productions. Singing Tannhäuser, Siegfried and Tristan at the 2022 festival earned him the nicknames Wagner Marathon Man and Iron Man. &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; was then the production staged by Tobias Kratzer, with the title role as a sad clown, and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; was staged by . Gould said in an interview then: &quot;Wagner is meditation, a mantra&quot;, hoping for spiritual depth, not entertainment.

==== Vienna State Opera ====
Gould first performed at the Vienna State Opera as Paul in the 2004 production of Korngold&#x27;s &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot;. He performed Wagner roles several times there over the years. He appeared as Erik in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; from 2007, as Bacchus in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; by Richard Strauss from 2012, in the title role of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in 2016, as Tristan in 2018, as the Emperor in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; by Richard Strauss in 2019, and as Verdi&#x27;s Otello in 2020. At the State Opera, he appeared on stage in 105 performances.

==== Other opera houses ====
Gould appeared as Paul in &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot; in the opera&#x27;s British premiere at the Royal Opera House in London in 2009, praised for his portrayal of the character &quot;gripped by the memory of his dead wife&quot;. He performed the title role of &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in Geneva, as Tannhäuser at Las Palmas and also in Rome, and as Otello in Tokyo. He appeared at the Dresden Semperoper in new productions of &quot;Die Liebe der Danae&quot; by Richard Strauss and &quot;Otello&quot;; as Tannhäuser in Tokyo, Paris and Geneva; as Erik in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in 2010, the Bavarian State Opera and the Palermo Opera; as Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in Trieste; as Bacchus in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;; and as Parsifal at the Graz Opera. In a new production of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle in Tokyo, he took the roles of Loge, Siegmund and Siegfried. In 2016, he performed the title role of William Bolcom&#x27;s &quot;McTeague&quot;. He appeared as Aegisth in &quot;Elektra&quot; by Richard Strauss in a concert performance in Berlin.

==== Concert ====
In concert, Gould performed Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony and Missa solemnis, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;, and Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. Gould worked with conductors such as Daniel Barenboim, Ádám Fischer, Zubin Mehta, Seiji Ozawa, Kirill Petrenko, Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen.

=== Personal life ===
Gould lived alternately in the United States and Austria or Germany.

On August 25, 2023, he announced his retirement from singing &quot;due to health reasons&quot;; he had to cancel three major roles at the Bayreuth Festival. He announced a diagnosis of terminal bile duct cancer via his personal website on September 5. Gould died in Chesapeake, Virginia, on September 19, 2023, at age 61.

== Recordings ==
Gould&#x27;s performances in Bayreuth were broadcast internationally and recorded, including &quot;Siegfried&quot; with Thielemann in 2009. He recorded &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, with Nina Stemme as Isolde and the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin conducted by Marek Janowski in 2012 and &quot;Siegfried&quot; with the same orchestra and conductor in 2013. He recorded a DVD of act 2 from &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, with Christine Goerke as Isolde, the National Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Gianandrea Noseda in 2019. The same year, he appeared as the Emperor in a recording of &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; by Strauss taken at the Vienna State Opera conducted by Thielemann. A reviewer noted: &quot;Every note is there with complete security, and the slightly dusky colour of his voice give him a particular colour.&quot;

In concert, Gould recorded Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and chorus conducted by Donald Runnicles in 2003. He recorded the tenor solo of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 as part of the live recordings of all Mahler symphonies with Riccardo Chailly conducting the MDR Rundfunkchor, the opera chorus Leipzig, the GewandhausChor, the Thomanerchor and the Gewandhausorchester, as part of the International Mahler Festival in Leipzig in 2011. He recorded Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; in 2020 with the MDR Rundfunkchor, the Staatsopernchor Dresden and the Staatskapelle Dresden joined by members of Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, conducted by Thielemann, singing the role of Waldemar.

== Awards ==
Gould received a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Opera Recording category for his performance in the Deutsche Grammophon recording &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014. He was awarded the title of an Austrian Kammersänger in 2015.

==Publications==
His book, &quot;Performing Wagner: A Singer’s Perspective on the Major Tenor Roles&quot;, was a result of Zoom conversations between Gould and F. Peter Phillips during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contains chapters on the roles of Tannhäuser, Tristan, Siegfried, Lohengrin and Parsifal, Further two chapters deal with conductors, stage directions and vocal technique. The epilogue, &quot;Colleagues Remember Stephen Gould&quot; features tributes from Ekaterina Gubanova, Petra Lang, Michael Volle and others. Katharina Wagner contributed the foreword.

<text>, initialed as SMFG until 2018 and SMBC Group since, is a major Japanese multinational financial services group and holding company. It is the parent of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), SMBC Trust Bank, and SMBC Nikko Securities. SMBC originates from the 2001 merger of Sumitomo Bank with the Sakura Bank, itself a successor to the Mitsui Bank, and the group holding entity was created in December 2002 after which SMBC became its wholly-owned subsidiary. 

SMBC Group operates in retail, corporate, and investment banking segment worldwide. It provides financial products and services to a wide range of clients, including individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities. It operates in over 40 countries and maintains a presence in all International Financial Centres as the 12th biggest bank in the world by total assets. It is one of the largest global financial institutions in project finance space by total loan value. It is headquartered in the Marunouchi neighborhood of Tokyo. 

SMBC Group is the second-largest of Japan&#x27;s three so-called megabanks, with $2 trillion of total assets at end-March 2023, behind Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ($2.9 trillion) and just ahead of Mizuho Financial Group ($1.9 trillion). As of 2024, SMBC group was listed as 63rd largest public company in the world according to Forbes Global 2000 ranking. It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.

== History ==

SMBC was formed by the merger of the Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank in April 2001. Its history could be viewed as going back to 1683, the date of first documented banking operations by Mitsui Takatoshi. The group&#x27;s two main historical components, Mitsui Bank and Sumitomo Bank, were established as modern private banks in the Meiji era, in 1875 and 1895 respectively. SMBC Group also incorporates several of the National Banks in Meiji Japan which were numbered in accordance with their chronological date of establishment until 1880: 

* the 5th National Bank, est. 1875 in Osaka, formed by former Samurai from the Satsuma Domain and merchants from Northern Kyushu, later relocated to Tokyo and merged 1898 into the 32th Bank (see below); 
* the 15th National Bank, est. 1877 in Tokyo, reorganized 1897 as , collapsed 1927 in that year&#x27;s financial crisis, eventually merged 1944 into Teikoku Bank; 
* the 32nd National Bank, est. 1878 in Osaka, merged 1920 into the Fifteenth Bank; 
* the 38th National Bank, est. 1878 in Himeji, merged 1936 with several other local banks to form the , itself merged 1973 with Taiyo Bank to form Taiyo Kobe Bank; 
* the 51st National Bank, est. 1878 in Kishiwada, merged 1940 with several other banks to form Hannan Bank, itself merged 1945 into Sumitomo Bank; 
* the 55th National Bank, est. 1878 in Izushi, merged 1928 with Tajima Bank, which itself was absorbed by the Bank of Kobe in 1945; 
* the 56th National Bank, est. 1878 in Akashi, later Goroku Bank, another participant in the merger that formed the Bank of Kobe in 1936; 
* the , est. 1878 in Kurume, acquired 1912 by Sumitomo Bank; 
* the , est. 1878 in Tottori, acquired 1928 by Kobe Okazaki Bank (est. 1917) which was another of the banks that formed the Bank of Kobe in 1936; 
* the 94th National Bank, est. 1878 in Tatsuno, absorbed 1917 by the 38th Bank; 
* the 106th National Bank, est. 1878 in Saga, acquired 1941 by Sumitomo Bank; 
* the 131st National Bank, est. 1879 in Kasukabe then relocated to Kano, merged 1881 into the 32nd National Bank; 
* the 137th National Bank, est. 1879 in Sasayama, split 1942 into two banks, one of which was absorbed by the Bank of Kobe; 
* the 142nd National Bank, est. 1879 in Chōshi, merged 1881 into the 32nd National Bank. 

At the time of the merger, the combined entity was of similar size to Deutsche Bank and to the pending merger that would soon form Mizuho Bank. 

===Early years===

The newly created bank was plagued with bad assets from the Japanese banking crisis. This led to several corporate actions taken by SMBC to clean up its balance sheet and raise capital, including writing off non-performing loans and selling its stake in Goldman Sachs.

SMBC announced on July 30, 2002 that it would establish a holding company by December and reorganize three related companies, its subsidiary Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company, Sumitomo Mitsui Bank Leasing, and The Japan Research Institute, a sister think tank, as subsidiaries of the holding company. The holding company had a capital of 1 trillion yen, and SMBC CEO Takashi Nishikawa and Chairman Akira Okada each served as president and chairman of the holding company.

In July 2002, SMBC announced that it would repay 2,000 billion yen of public funds, which had been accepted in the form of perpetual subordinated bonds. The funds were part of a total of 1.5 trillion yen that had been injected into the Japanese banking system following the financial crisis of the late 1990s. In 2005, SMBC announced a three-year repayment plan, and in October of that year, it repaid an additional 323.6 billion yen. SMFG initially targeted repaying all of its public funds by the end of the 2006 fiscal year. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and Mizuho Financial Group (MHFG) also had the same goal. These moves were due to a number of factors, including the active resolution of non-performing loans, which had stabilized the financial system, and the increased repayment capacity of the banks. The Financial Services Agency had also encouraged banks to repay their funds early, and some banks, which were reluctant to have their management interfered with by the authorities, had responded.

In December 2002, SMBC began considering a takeover of the Aozora Bank, which was established after the collapse of the former The Nippon Credit Bank. The Aozora Bank President Hiroshi Maruyama expressed reservations about the proposal, as it would have made it difficult for the bank to go public and repay public funds from the proceeds of the IPO. SMBC competed with a joint venture between the US investment firm Cerberus and the German bank HypoVereinsbank, and the US financial company GE Capital. The offer price was about 100 billion yen, and Cerberus also offered the same amount. However, Cerberus, as a major shareholder of Aozora Bank with a 12% stake, had the right to purchase the bank first if the offer price was the same as that of the other bidders. In April 2003, Cerberus announced the acquisition of the Aozora Bank.

In March 2003, SMBC initiated a reverse merger with its subsidiary, Wakashio Bank (est. June 1996), to secure financial resources to cover large deferred losses from its equity holdings. Although SMBC was technically dissolved and Wakashio Bank became a company that survived, under the Japanese Commercial Code, the surviving entity took the name Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., just like the disbanded bank name. SMBC President Yoshifumi Nishikawa and chairman Akishige Okada became president and Chairman of the new entity respectively. Hiroyasu Ichikawa, President of Wakashio Bank, assumed the position of senior managing director. The purpose of the merger was to generate about 2 trillion yen in book profits (merger surplus) by making the Wakashio Bank the surviving company, and to eliminate the hidden losses of SMBC, such as those on stocks. The profit, then, was used to accelerate write-offs of the bank&#x27;s unrealized securities losses and boost sales of its shareholdings to reduce risk from the fluctuation of stock prices. Post the merger, the new entity grew rapidly through organic and inorganic growth strategy. The assets expanded from 102.4 trillion yen in 2003 to more than 200 trillion yen by the end of 2019, making it the 12th largest bank in the world. 

On July 14, 2004, UFJ Holdings announced that it had decided to enter into negotiations with Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG) for a management integration. In response, on July 30, SMFG announced that it had made a management integration proposal to UFJ. On August 8, it was reported that SMFG had sent a formal proposal document summarizing the detailed terms of the integration plan to MTFG. In response to MTFG&#x27;s plan to provide an investment of approximately 500 billion yen, SMFG said that it would invest at least 500 billion yen and up to 700 billion yen. SMFG proposed a merger ratio of &quot;1 to 1.&quot; The recent stock prices of SMFG and UFJ were 1 to 0.77 on average over the past six months, which was an exceptionally favorable condition for UFJ shareholders. However, in February 2005, MTFG and UFJ signed a merger agreement with a merger ratio of &quot;1 to 0.62.&quot; SMFG officially decided to withdraw its management integration proposal to UFJ and notified UFJ in writing. On January 1, 2006, MTFG and UFJ Holdings merged to form Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. While SMBC eventually lost the contest, it was credited with increasing competition within Japan&#x27;s once staid banking industry. 

In February 2005, it was revealed that SMFG was in negotiations with Daiwa Securities Group, with a view to a possible merger of the two companies. The two groups had already established a joint venture, Daiwa Securities SMBC, a specialist in corporate transactions, but they were considering merging their holding companies to achieve a complete integration of the groups as a whole. They hoped to achieve this as early as the 2005 fiscal year. However, on April 8, Daiwa Securities Group Holdings President Shigeharu Suzuki said, &quot;There are no benefits to a merger at this time, and we have no plans to begin negotiations with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group.&quot;

In September 2006, SMFG acquired SMBC Friend Securities, which was a majority-owned subsidiary of SMBC with a 40% stake.

SMFG announced on October 17, 2006, that it had repaid all of its public funds. MUFG repaid the funds it had inherited from its predecessor, UFJ Bank, in June. MHFG repaid its public funds in July, which had once approached 3 trillion yen. SMFG had initially targeted repaying its public funds by the end of the fiscal year, but it moved up the repayment schedule out of concern that it would be &quot;half a lap behind&quot; the other megabanks.

In December 2006, SMFG announced that it would consolidate its headquarters functions in the Ōtemachi district of Tokyo. Since the merger in 2001, SMFG had its head office in the former Mitsui Bank building in Hibiya, with some headquarters functions in Marunouchi. The new headquarters is located next to the former Sumitomo Bank building, and the move was completed in October 2010. SMFG President Masayuki Oku said, &quot;By consolidating our headquarters, we can improve efficiency and realize advanced and fast-paced operations.&quot;

===Subsequent development===

On April 27, 2007, SMFG and Mitsui &amp; Co. announced that they would invest a total of ¥400 billion in Central Finance Co., Ltd, a credit card company affiliated with MUFG Group. SMFG would effectively own 20% of CF, giving it a controlling stake. This move was seen as an effort by SMFG to strengthen its credit card business, which was lagging behind those of other megabanks. The move was initiated by CF last summer, without the knowledge of MUFG. Central Finance had been in talks with SMFG since then. Meanwhile, MUFG had been trying to merge CF with its close credit card company, Jaccs. However, CF President Tatsuo Tsutikawa and other executives opposed MUFG&#x27;s plan. &quot;It was not an option for us to stay with MUFG,&quot; Tsutikawa said. &quot;Our unique characteristics would not have been allowed to flourish.&quot; At that time, CF was also considering a merger with Quoq Card, a credit card company in the SMFG.

In July 2007, SMBC acquired a portion of the shares of Daiei&#x27;s credit card subsidiary, OMC Card, from the struggling retailer for ¥74.8 billion. SMBC then became OMC Card&#x27;s parent company. With the addition of OMC Card to its existing subsidiaries, Sumitomo Mitsui Card and Central Finance, SMBC&#x27;s total cardholder base exceeded 40 million, surpassing its rival, Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS (37 million). SMBC President Masayuki Oku said, &quot;We want to build a group that balances the strengths of banks, credit card companies, and retail card companies.&quot;

In July 2008, SMBC Group bought a 2.1 percent stake in Barclays Bank for £500m.

Since 2008, the Singapore branch has become SMBC&#x27;s regional hub in Asia Pacific while global headquarters is still maintained in Tokyo, Japan.

In February 2009, Citigroup, a US financial company in the midst of a restructuring, announced its intention to sell its Japanese subsidiary, Nikko Cordial Securities, a retail brokerage firm. SMFG, along with MUFG and MHFG, expressed its intention to buy the company. In the final round of bidding on April 20, SMFG submitted the highest bid. On May 2, SMFG officially announced the acquisition of Nikko Cordial Securities and the major businesses of Nikko Citigroup Securities for ¥545 billion. In October 2009, SMBC purchased all of the operations of Nikko Cordial Securities and certain businesses of Nikko Citigroup, such as the domestic stock and bond underwriting business among others, before reorganizing them into a new subsidiary company, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., in April 2011. SMBC Nikko Securities becomes investment banking arm of SMBC group and offers equity and debt financing, trading, and merger and acquisition advisory services worldwide with the main base in Japan.

In April 2009, SMFG began considering a preliminary merger of its corporate brokerage business with Daiwa Securities Group, as part of a comprehensive partnership. The corporate brokerage firm Daiwa Securities SMBC, in which SMFG owns 40% and Daiwa owns 60%, was to be merged with part of Nikko Citigroup Securities, with SMFG increasing its stake in the new entity. On May 12, 2009, Daiwa Securities Group President Shigeharu Suzuki said, &quot;a merger of Daiwa Securities SMBC and the major departments of Nikko Citigroup Securities was natural given the two companies&#x27; competition.&quot; He also said, &quot;a full-scale merger of Daiwa Securities (a retail brokerage firm) and Nikko Cordial Securities was not in the cards.&quot; However, the full-scale negotiations that began in mid-July dragged on longer than expected. SMFG wanted to increase its stake in Daiwa SMBC from 40% to over 50%, but Daiwa was reluctant. On September 10, 2009, SMFG and Daiwa Securities Group announced that they would dissolve the joint venture for Daiwa Securities SMBC. Daiwa would buy all of the SMFG-owned shares, which represented 40% of the total, for ¥173.9 billion. Daiwa Securities SMBC would be renamed Daiwa Securities Capital Markets and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiwa.

The bank steadily increased its tier 1 capital ratios from 12.19% in 2014 to 16.69% as reported in March 2018. Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, Moody&#x27;s and Fitch Ratings assigned SMBC&#x27;s an A1, A and A rating respectively (as at March 2018).

In March 2015, SMBC Group bought HK$6.58 billion (JP¥105 billion, US$849 million) of new Bank of East Asia shares, raising SMBC&#x27;s stake in the Hong Kong lender to 17.5% from 9.7%. In January 2019, SMBC Indonesia merged with PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk, also known as Bank BTPN. The group owned 96.89% ownership of the bank since the merger was completed on 1 February 2019, with Bank BTPN as the surviving brand. Indonesian authorities approved the merger in December 2018, while Japanese authorities approved the merger a month later.

In April 2016, Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing completed the acquisition of General Electric Group&#x27;s Japan-based leasing business.

In January 2019, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) raised its stake in PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Negara Tbk (BTPN) to 96.9 percent, increasing its position from its previous 39.92% stake at IDR4,282 per share. Bank BTPN focuses on serving the mass market segment consisting of pensioners, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), productive poor communities; consuming class segment; and the corporate segment in Indonesia. Post acquisition, the entity was merged with SMBC&#x27;s subsidiary in Indonesia. In a summary of the proposed merger of BTPN and Bank Sumitomo Indonesia, the total assets and total equity of the merged bank reached a total IDR 178 trillion and IDR 26.92 trillion respectively, using financial position as of 31 May 2018. Upon the merger, BTPN became the 8th largest bank in Indonesia by total assets. In August 2024, BTPN changed its name to PT Bank SMBC Indonesia Tbk.

In March 2020, SMBC Group agreed to buy a 4.9 percent stake in Ares Management. As part of this agreement, the group will make a US$384 million equity investment into the firm.

In April 2023, SMBC announced a plan to triple its stake in US investment bank Jefferies Financial Group bringing total ownership to as much as 15%. It was part of a broader collaboration between the two companies that would allow SMBC to take on larger rivals while advising and lending to investment-grade companies globally, in addition to working in leveraged finance and mergers and acquisitions.

In August 2024, it was reported that SMBC Group was in the race with Emirates NBD to acquire a majority stake in Yes Bank.

===Corporate governance===

As of 2024, SMBC group operates with a Board of Directors comprising 13 members with diverse expertise, experience, and backgrounds, including a variety of genders and nationalities. A majority of the board—seven members—are outside directors. The chairman of the board, who does not have responsibilities related to day-to-day business operations, provides independent oversight of the executive officers and directors. 

Outside directors also chair and serve on both legally mandated and voluntarily established committees. These directors can request reports on compliance, risk management, and other key matters, helping ensure that the company&#x27;s governance system operates effectively and independently.

Over the years, the group has made several adjustments to its governance framework. In 2002, it established voluntary Nominating, Compensation, and Risk Committees as internal committees of the Board of Directors, followed by the addition of an Audit Committee in 2005. The company listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010 to enhance transparency in financial reporting and diversify funding methods. In 2015, SMFG formalized its corporate governance guidelines.

By 2017, the group transitioned to a Company with Three Committees structure, increasing the number of outside directors and appointing them as chairpersons of the three legally mandated committees. In 2024, outside directors constituted the majority of the Board of Directors. A Sustainability Committee was also established in 2021, chaired by an outside director, to address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.

The group&#x27;s corporate governance system is designed to enhance oversight and expedite decision-making. The company conducts annual evaluations of the effectiveness of its Board of Directors and committees to identify areas for improvement. Core subsidiaries, such as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and SMBC Nikko Securities, employ a Company with Audit and Supervisory Committee system as described in the Companies Act.

===SMBC Aviation Capital===
SMBC Aviation Capital, formerly RBS Aviation Capital, is one of the world&#x27;s largest aircraft leasing companies. Headquartered in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin and with locations in Amsterdam, Beijing, Hong Kong, Kyiv, Moscow, New York, Seattle, Miami, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and Toulouse, the company employs 160 people.

In 2012, the company was acquired by the Japanese consortium of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Company Limited (SMFL) and Sumitomo Corporation for US$7.3 billion which was the largest ever global sale of an aircraft leasing business. The sale completed on 1 June 2012 and the business was renamed SMBC Aviation Capital.

The company currently has a portfolio of 453 aircraft (273 owned and 180 managed) with a further 203 aircraft on order from Airbus and Boeing, made up of a mix of A320neos, A320-200s, B737-800s and B737 MAXs. It has more than 150 airline customers in over 50 countries worldwide, including a range of traditional carriers alongside start-up airlines.

Its strategy is to own and lease technologically advanced, efficient and frequently-used aircraft types. SMBC Aviation Capital maintains a young fleet with an average weighted age of 4.7 years. The company has a BBB+ rating from Fitch.

The company is now in its 15th year in business. In July 2016, the company completed a debut US$500 million unsecured notes offering, which was eight times over-subscribed.

==Branding==

===Group name===

The group was identified by its holding entity name, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), until early of 2018. By March 2018, the group established &quot;SMBC Group&quot; as its master brand name. Since then, the corporate group has been referred to as SMBC Group instead of SMFG. The press release by the company stated the move is to associate the brand with the group&#x27;s core banking business, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.

===Corporate logo===

SMBC Group&#x27;s corporate logo uses &quot;Rising Mark&quot; sign. The background color is trad green, fresh green. The &quot;SMBC&quot; name is shown on the right side of the rising mark with white block letters.

===Mascot character===

In 2014, SMBC Group created an original mascot character called &quot;Midosuke&quot;, which imitates an otter. The body of the character is green in color, the neck of it is covered by a scarf with the color similar to SMBC group&#x27;s rising mark logo. The character was designed by Tsuneo Goda (Dwarf Co., Ltd.). Originally, it was used mainly for official LINE accounts but later it has been used as commercials character, face design of cash cards or debit cards, and merchandise for bank customers.

===Sponsorships===

SMBC and Singapore Open have a title sponsorship deal since 2016, making the Singapore top golf tournament commercially known as SMBC Singapore Open. The Singapore Open is a golf tournament in Singapore that is part of the Asian Tour schedule. The event has been held at Sentosa Golf Club since 2005 and since 2017 has been part of the Open Qualifying Series, giving up to four non-exempt players entry into The Open Championship.

In April 2015, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation became a Gold Partner (banking category) for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.

Since 2014, SMBC has owned the naming rights for the Japan Series.

==Digital banking==

===IC cash card===
As of 2017, SMBC issued IC cash cards at the bank&#x27;s counters (only applicable to ordinary design deposit cash cards; cards of other designs and non-savings accounts are not eligible for immediate issuance).

An IC cash card is a single cash card that can be used with three method of identification: biometric authentication, IC chip or magnetic stripe, by setting the limit and registering biometric information (finger vein pattern). With this cash card, the security of usage improved since transactions relies on IC chip recording data and the pattern of past transactions that combined IC chip recording data and biometric authentication.

===Artificial Intelligence===

SMBC has been an early adopter of AI in its banking operation in Japan. It is the first Japanese bank to use IBM Watson since 2014 to support operators at its call center. AmiVoice, a voice recognition solution provided by SMBC, transforms inquiries into text on a real-time basis as a speech recognition system, while IBM Watson gives customers responses taken from service manuals and Q&amp;As, thereby allowing digital operators to provide timely and correct answers to callers.

===Jenius Bank===

The group presence in digital banking is represented through its Jenius platform, which initially launched in Indonesia in 2016 under its subsidiary Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional (BTPN). Designed to cater to tech-savvy and mobile-first customers, Jenius in Indonesia provides services in digital financial solutions, offering features such as seamless account management, innovative savings tools, and integrated payment options.

Building on this success, SMBC extended its digital banking initiative to the U.S. market with the establishment of Jenius Bank, a division of SMBC MANUBANK (formerly Manufacturers Bank), in mid-2023. Jenius Bank in the U.S. operates as a fully digital bank without physical branches, focusing on personal loans, savings, and checking accounts. By December 2024, it had surpassed $1 billion in deposits. Jenius Bank also plans to expand its services to include investment products and online securities brokerage.

==Exposure to SMEs==

Compared with its two megabank rivals, SMBC group has a greater exposure on retail customers and small and medium-size enterprises rather than large corporate clients. The group has implemented several strategic initiatives to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across various regions. For instance, the SMBC Asia Rising Fund is a dedicated initiative aimed at supporting the growth of SMEs across Asia by providing access to financing and fostering cross-border business opportunities. By focusing on SMEs, the fund seeks to drive regional economic development while empowering smaller businesses to expand their operations and compete on a global scale. In November 2024, SMBC&#x27;s Asia Rising Fund made a strategic investment in MODIFI, a digital trade finance platform. This partnership aims to empower SME exporters in Asia by providing innovative cross-border financing solutions, enhancing their ability to expand international trade operations.

In Indonesia, SMBC holds a significant stake in Bank BTPN which focuses on providing financial services to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), as well as underbanked social groups.

Domestically, SMBC&#x27;s Wholesale Business Unit supports the growth of domestic companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by providing tailored financial solutions. These services include financing, investment management, payments, M&amp;A advisory, leasing, and real estate brokerage.
The group&#x27;s loan balance reached ¥19.6 billion ($143 million) for mid-sized corporates and SMEs during the year ending March 2022. Notably, in the January to March 2022 quarter, the average loan balance for SMEs and mid-sized companies exceeded that of large corporates.

On the risk perspective, the SME exposure is seen as higher risk assets by rating agencies. For instance, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch ratings mentioned that SMBC group&#x27;s exposure to mid-sized corporates and SMEs, while providing higher margin, may leave asset quality more susceptible to economic downcycles than peers.

==Environmental policy and record==

SMBC group has outlined several initiatives related to sustainability and climate change. The company has committed to achieving net-zero operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 and portfolio emissions by 2050. Its efforts include implementing transition finance, supporting renewable energy projects, and facilitating the early retirement of coal-fired power plants. The group has also introduced environmental and social due diligence into its credit assessments and set mid-term GHG reduction targets for sectors such as power, oil and gas, and real estate. Additionally, the establishment of a Sustainability Division supports the company’s approach to managing climate-related risks and integrating sustainability into its operations.

SMBC was among the first Japanese Bank to adopt the Equator Principles, an international set of social and environmental standards for financial institutions launched in 2003. The bank updated its policy to exclude the funding of ultrasupercritical coal power.

In regard to green financing, SMBC has been involved in funding renewable energy projects globally, amounting to three trillion yen. As one of the leading players in finance for offshore wind power and solar energy generation, SMBC has been funding renewable power plant projects with a total capacity of more than 10 GW by 2018. Since 2016, the bank has supported 44 project finance deals in renewable energy area. The projects consist of 20 solar energy, 17 wind energy, 3 Geothermal Energy, 2 Hydropower, 1 Biomass 1 Submarine power cable, 1 waste-to-energy in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Australasia.

However, international environmental groups have criticized SMBC for failing to adhere to its social environmental standards, because SMBC is still involved in the financing of coal projects such as the Vung Ang 2 and Nghi Son 2 coal power station in Vietnam. In December 2019, a research released at United Nations Climate Change conference named SMBC Group among the top three private lender to coal developers between January 2017 and September 2019.

SMBC also involves as one of lead arrangers for a massive oil pipeline under construction in Uganda and Tanzania. The construction of East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline is a part of a push to open oil fields around Uganda’s Lake Albert to international markets, which will be connected to the port of Tanga in Tanzania. The required investment value is estimated at US$3.5 billion. With 1,443 kilometres of length, it will be the longest heated pipeline in the world. International organizations warned the environmental risks to fresh water sources including Lake Victoria, which supports the livelihoods of more than 30 million people in the region.

Having said this, news reported that SMBC is to reconsider its prolific funding of coal-fired plants, the first of the nation&#x27;s major banks to do so.

==Controversies==

===Administrative actions imposed by FSA in 2006===

In 2006, the group was subjected to administrative actions by Japan&#x27;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) under Article 26 of the Banking Law. These measures were imposed following findings by the Fair Trade Commission of Japan (JFTC), which revealed that SMBC had violated Article 19 of the Anti-Monopoly Law by abusing its dominant position in the sales of interest-rate derivative products between 2001 and 2004. The JFTC identified multiple instances of misconduct, including coercive sales practices for interest-rate swaps, and further internal investigations revealed systemic governance and compliance failures within SMBC. These issues stemmed from a profit-driven culture that prioritized sales targets over legal and ethical compliance, inadequate internal controls, and insufficient risk awareness regarding antitrust regulations.

The administrative actions mandated several corrective measures to address SMBC’s governance deficiencies and compliance failures. Sales operations for interest-rate derivative products in the corporate sales department were suspended for six months, from May 15, 2006, to November 14, 2006, except when customers voluntarily expressed interest. Additionally, SMBC was prohibited from establishing new corporate sales departments for one year, until May 14, 2007. To enforce long-term compliance, SMBC was required to overhaul its governance framework, including establishing a customer-oriented sales system, improving internal auditing, strengthening compliance oversight, and ensuring thorough training for employees on legal and ethical standards. Specific reforms included clearer accountability for executives and employees involved in the misconduct, enhanced systems for handling customer complaints and inquiries, and stricter controls over financial instrument sales practices.

===Yakuza exclusion ordinances===
Since 2011, Japan&#x27;s law regulators enacted a series of efforts to battle organized crime activities in the country. This includes exclusion ordinances that made it illegal to do business with yakuza gang members. In 2013, the Financial Services Agency, Japan&#x27;s financial watchdog, started an investigation of the three mega banks over possible ties to organised crime after Mizuho banking group was accused of lending more than US$2 million to people affiliated with organized crime groups in Japan. The probe also focused on compliance practices and risk management systems of the banks.

In order to distance themselves from the yakuza, the Japanese Bankers Association&#x27;s members, including SMBC Group, started to compile their own lists on yakuza and other so-called anti-social forces to keep undesirable persons from using their services.

===2012 SMBC Nikko Securities insider trading probe===

In June 2012, an employee of SMBC Nikko securities was arrested for alleged insider trading due to suspicions of having leaked information on tender offers. The employee allegedly provided leaked information on tender offers for at least more than 10 firms to a company top personnel and other recipients. One such piece of information was regarding a management buyout bid by a wine trading house, Enoteca Co., before the takeover bid was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange&#x27;s Second Section in February.

The said employee worked for SMBC Nikko on secondment from Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui&#x27;s banking unit since October 2009. He was the deputy head of investment banking at that time and was loaned from SMBC bank. He became the first banker from a major Japanese brokerage to be detained for suspected insider trading since 2008. He was ultimately convicted by Yokohama District Court in 2013 and charged with prison sentence of 2 years and 6 months.

As a consequence of this event, The Tokyo Stock Exchange fined SMBC Nikko Securities 80 million yen (US$1.02 million).

===2021 SMBC Nikko Securities Stock Manipulation Scandal===

SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. has been embroiled in a major stock price manipulation scandal, resulting in significant legal and financial consequences. The Tokyo District Court, on February 2023, fined the company 700 million yen (about $5.3 million) and imposed an additional penalty of 4.47 billion yen. This ruling stemmed from allegations that the brokerage had engaged in illegal practices to manipulate the closing prices of 10 stocks listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange between 2019 and 2021.

As part of the verdict, Teruya Sugino, the former deputy head of SMBC Nikko’s equities division, was sentenced to 18 months in prison. However, the sentence was suspended for three years due to his role in violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. According to the court, SMBC Nikko used approximately 4.4 billion yen of its own funds to place large buy orders just before market close, artificially boosting stock prices. These inflated prices were then used in block trades, where the brokerage mediated transactions between major shareholders and investors. The firm was suspected of using its proprietary trading desk to illegitimately maintain the price of stocks in block trades.

The court determined that the firm profited unlawfully, gaining around 1.09 billion yen from the scheme. Sugino was specifically implicated in one of the block trades. The court concluded that there was a significant failure in SMBC Nikko&#x27;s internal supervision, with Sugino bearing substantial responsibility for his role in facilitating the scheme, despite being aware of its illegality. In addition to Sugino, five other SMBC Nikko executives, including former Vice President Toshihiro Sato, have been indicted in the scandal. On 13 April, prosecutors charged the vice president and filed new criminal charges against the firm. On 14 February 2023, a court ordered SMBC Nikko Securities to pay a fine of 700 million yen ($5.3 million) and an additional penalty of around 4.47 billion yen for manipulating stock prices.

===Omori branch employee fraud===
A former deputy branch manager of the Omori branch illegally operated the foreign currency deposit transaction system from November 2015 to June 2016. The employee was accused of stealing around ¥190 million (US$1.84 million) by manipulating the bank&#x27;s foreign exchange trading system.

===Hugh Rodley bank raid===
A group of criminal hackers including Hugh Rodley, security insider Kevin O&#x27;Donoghue, and Soho sex shop owner David Nash were found guilty of an attempted high-tech robbery of £229m from Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation&#x27;s London branch in September 2004. Henchmen Jan Van Osselaer and Gilles Poelvoorde were also found guilty of conspiracy to steal. The plot was discovered by Sumitomo Mitsui staff, and no money was stolen. Another accused, Bernard Davies, died before trial.

===Bank of East Asia dispute with Elliott Management===
Hedge fund activist investor Elliott Management filed a lawsuit against BEA in July 2016 in Hong Kong court over a share placement transaction. Elliott Management, which held 7% of listed shares of BEA, had included majority of the bank&#x27;s directors, its CEO and chairman in the lawsuit. The transaction in question was on BEA&#x27;s issuance of new shares to Japan&#x27;s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) in 2015. Elliott cited &quot;allegations of unfairly prejudicial conduct&quot; and &quot;alleged serious corporate governance failings&quot;.

In response, BEA applied to have Elliott&#x27;s petition against them &quot;struck out&quot;. This case was heard by Mr. Justice Jonathan Harris from 17 to 19 July 2017.

<doc id="876728" wikidata="Q1518589" url="?curid=876728" title="The Muppet Movie">
<text>The Muppet Movie is a 1979 musical road comedy film directed by James Frawley and produced by Jim Henson, and the first theatrical film to feature the Muppets. A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, the film was written by &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; writers Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns. Produced during the third season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the film tells the origin story of the Muppets, as Kermit the Frog embarks on a cross-country trip to Los Angeles, encountering several of the Muppets—who all share the same ambition of finding success in professional show business—along the way while being pursued by Doc Hopper, a greedy restaurateur with intentions of employing Kermit as a spokesperson for his frog legs business.

The film stars Muppet performers Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, and Dave Goelz, as well as Charles Durning and Austin Pendleton, and it features cameo appearances by Bob Hope, Dom DeLuise, James Coburn, Cloris Leachman, Richard Pryor, Telly Savalas, Edgar Bergen (in his final film appearance before his death), Orson Welles, Carol Kane, Steve Martin, and Mel Brooks, among others. Notable for its surreal humour, meta-references and prolific use of cameos, &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; was released by Associated Film Distribution in the United Kingdom on May 31, 1979, and in the United States on June 22, 1979.

The film received critical praise, including two Academy Award nominations for Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher&#x27;s musical score and their song, &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot;. &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; was followed by seven feature films starring the Muppets, as well as several more television series and media. In 2009, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

The story opens with the Muppets sitting down for a private screening of a movie that acts as an origin story of how they all met.

Kermit the Frog lives a simple life in a Florida swamp. After he plays his banjo and sings &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot;, he is approached by Bernie, a talent agent who encourages him to pursue a career in show business. Inspired, Kermit sets off on a cross-country trip to Hollywood.

He meets Fozzie Bear, who is working as a hapless stand-up comedian, and invites him on his journey. The two set out in Fozzie&#x27;s 1951 Studebaker but are pursued by entrepreneur Doc Hopper and his assistant Max, who try to convince Kermit to be the new spokesfrog of Hopper&#x27;s struggling French-fried frog legs restaurant franchise. Horrified, Kermit refuses, and he and Fozzie drive away. Unwilling to accept Kermit&#x27;s refusal, Hopper follows the pair and resorts to increasingly forceful means of persuasion. In an old church, Kermit and Fozzie meet the rock band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, and the band&#x27;s manager Scooter, who help them disguise their car. Driving on, they meet and are joined by Gonzo and his girlfriend Camilla the Chicken, who are also interested in becoming movie stars. They trade in their failing vehicle at a used car lot, where they meet Sweetums. They invite Sweetums to come with them, but he runs away. The others drive away, only for Sweetums to emerge and reveal that he had only gone to pack his things.

The group meets Miss Piggy at a county fair, and she and Kermit become love-stricken with each other. When they meet for dinner that night, Hopper and Max sneak up on Miss Piggy and abduct her as bait to lure Kermit. When Kermit arrives at the designated location, mad scientist Professor Krassman tries to brainwash him into performing in Hopper&#x27;s advertisements, but Miss Piggy knocks out Hopper&#x27;s henchmen and causes Krassman to be brainwashed by his own device. However, immediately after the fight, Miss Piggy receives a job offer and abandons a devastated Kermit.

Joined by Rowlf the Dog and reunited with Miss Piggy, the Muppets continue their journey to Hollywood, but their car breaks down in the desert. Sitting at a campfire, the group realizes that they will likely miss the audition the next day. Kermit wanders off, ashamed for bringing his friends on a fruitless journey, but personal reflection restores his commitment. He returns to camp, where he discovers that the Electric Mayhem have come to their rescue, having learned of their plight by reading ahead in the film&#x27;s script. The Mayhem offer to drive the group the rest of the way in their bus.

The group is warned by a reformed Max that Hopper has hired an assassin, Snake Walker, to kill Kermit. Kermit decides to face his aggressor and proposes a Western-style showdown in a nearby ghost town. There, they find inventor Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker. Kermit and his friends are saved when one of Dr. Honeydew&#x27;s inventions, &quot;insta-grow&quot; pills, enlarges Mayhem drummer Animal, who frightens away Hopper and his henchmen.

Once the Muppets reach the Hollywood studio, they meet executive Lew Lord, who signs them to a &quot;standard &#x27;rich and famous&#x27; contract&quot;. The first take in their attempt to perform the script goes awry when Gonzo crashes into the prop rainbow, and an explosion blows a hole in the roof of the studio; a rainbow shines through the hole and illuminates the Muppets. Joined by Muppet characters from other Henson productions, including &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot;, and &quot;The Land of Gorch&quot;, the Muppets sing the final verse in a reprise of &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot; as the film ends; just as Sweetums tears through the screen, elated that he caught up with them.

==Production==
===Development===
After the popularity of the Muppets had grown following the success of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Lew Grade agreed to finance the production of the film and signed the deal with his company ITC Entertainment, which helped Jim Henson finance the film. After the film&#x27;s production greenlit, Jim Henson and selected team members traveled to California various times to develop the script, music, and infrastructure in Hollywood to shoot the film. James Frawley was hired to direct the movie due to the film&#x27;s challenges.

During Frawley and Henson&#x27;s first meeting in London, they were concerned that the Muppets would not blend well in real life. Along with Frank Oz and the team, they filmed and tested how the characters would appear in real-world locations during the first few days of June 1978 in a UK meadow. During filming tests, a cow was ambled near Fozzie for an unexpected rear look at a comparison between fake and natural fur hair. The camera tests attracted the investment of ITC Entertainment. On July 3, 1978, Henson flew to Los Angeles again to begin shooting for the film.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on July 5, 1978, and continued for 87 days during summer and fall of that year. Each minute took a day to be filmed. Filming locations included Albuquerque, New Mexico as well as various parts of Los Angeles and Northern California, including the San Fernando Valley. The Western street scenes were filmed on the former Columbia Ranch, then known as The Burbank Studios. Additionally, the interior shots were filmed at CBS-MTM Studios. All the sets were elevated by five feet to allow the puppeteers to perform. According to Henson, the principal photography of the film was slower than in television. No effects were added after filming concluded.

Austin Pendleton recalled that the film was shot on &quot;a very unhappy set, because Jim [Frawley] was very unhappy directing that movie. And I noticed that was the only time the Muppet people used an outside person to direct a Muppet movie. They never did that again. After that, it was either Jim Henson or Frank Oz. And I would have liked to have been in one of those, because those sets were very harmonious. But this was not.&quot;

Several shots required Muppets standing and acting in a full-body shot. To perform Kermit sitting on a log, Henson squeezed into a specially designed metal container complete with an air hose (to breathe), a rubber sleeve which came out of the top to perform Kermit and a monitor to see his performance, and placed himself under the water, log, and the Kermit puppet. He was also assisted in this operation by Kathryn Mullen and Steve Whitmire. During breaks, cups of ice tea were given to Henson through the rubber sleeve since he could not easily leave the tank. Rescuers had to stand by the tank to pull Henson out if the tank leaked or the air supply had difficulties. The scene took five days to be filmed.

To have Kermit ride a bicycle in a full-body shot, a Kermit puppet with legs was posed onto the seat and his legs and arms were attached to the pedals and handlebars. An overhead crane with a marionette system held the bicycle through strong strings invisible to the camera, guiding the bicycle forward. The crane and system were out of the camera&#x27;s frame of vision. Specially made, remote-controlled puppets were placed on the set and controlled by puppeteers out of the frame. A dancing Kermit and Fozzie Bear were operated by Henson and Oz in front of a blue screen, and they were composited onto a separate reel of the stage. For scenes involving Fozzie driving a Studebaker, cables, TV monitors, puppeteers, and its Muppets were filled in. A dwarf would sit in the trunk and control via remote control. A television monitor showed what was ahead.

The closing reprise of &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot; featured a crowd of more than 250 Muppet characters—virtually every Muppet that had been created up to that point in time. According to Henson Archivist Karen Falk, 137 puppeteers were enlisted from the Puppeteers of America (along with the regular Muppets performers) to perform every Muppet extant. Prior to the day-long filming of the shot, Henson gave the enthusiastic participants a lesson in the art of cinematic puppetry. The scene involved 150 puppeteers performing in a pit that was 6 feet deep and 17 feet wide. In September 1978, Edgar Bergen, Henson&#x27;s idol who appeared in a cameo role, died shortly after completing his scenes. Henson was asked by his family to say a few words with Kermit for his memorial service. Henson agreed, and he attended Bergen&#x27;s memorial service for its speech. Henson dedicated the film to his memory.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s music and lyrics were written by Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher. Regarding the music&#x27;s composition, Williams said; &quot;Jim Henson gave you more [creative] freedom than anybody I&#x27;ve ever worked with in my life. I said, &#x27;You want to hear the songs as we&#x27;re writing them?&#x27; He said, &#x27;No. I&#x27;ll hear them in the studio. I know I&#x27;m gonna love them.&#x27; You just don&#x27;t get that kind of freedom on a project these days.&quot; &quot;Never Before, Never Again&quot; was originally sung by Johnny Mathis, but was changed to Miss Piggy when Jim Henson thought it would be funnier if she sang it to herself. Mathis would later sing the song in the television special &quot;The Muppets Go Hollywood&quot;.

&quot;Movin&#x27; Right Along&quot;, &quot;Never Before, Never Again&quot;, and &quot;I Hope That Somethin&#x27; Better Comes Along&quot; were shortened in the film, compared to their soundtrack versions, for continuity purposes. The latter, a duet between Rowlf and Kermit, contained references that the studio considered too mature for children, although the song appeared complete in the British theatrical and home video debut versions.

==Release==
&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; had a royal premiere at the Leicester Square Theatre in London on May 31, 1979, attended by Princess Anne. In the United States, the film premiered with a celebration at the Coconut Grove in Hollywood, Los Angeles. It was later released with limited release in New York City, Toronto, Los Angeles, Wichita, Kansas City, Austin, and the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex on June 22, 1979. The film rolled out gradually throughout the United States and Canada. In celebration of the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary, &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; returned to theaters for two days on July 25 and 30, 2019. The film also returned to theaters to celebrate its 45th anniversary on June 2 and 3, 2024, via Fathom Events.

===Marketing===
In May 1979, CBS aired &quot;The Muppets Go Hollywood&quot;, a one-hour television special that promoted the then-upcoming release of &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;. In April, the film had been promoted when the Muppets hosted &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Additionally, a book adaptation of &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, adapted by Steven Crist, was published by Peacock Press/Bantam Books.

In Austin, Texas, then-CBS affiliate KTBC-TV and American International Traveler sponsored a contest where adults who paid to see the film in the area were eligible to win a free trip to Hollywood.

===Home media===
&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; was the first film by ITC Films to be released on home video when Magnetic Video issued it in May 1980, having acquired the video rights to ITC&#x27;s films. It was reissued in 1982 and 1984 by CBS/Fox Video. On January 29, 1993, Buena Vista Home Video re-released the film under their Jim Henson Video label on VHS and LaserDisc, pricing at $24.99. The movie was reissued again on VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Video and Jim Henson Home Entertainment on June 1, 1999, followed by a DVD release on June 5, 2001. After Disney&#x27;s acquisition of the film as part of the core Muppets franchise, the film was reissued as a Walt Disney Pictures release and was re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on DVD on November 29, 2005, as part of the &quot;Kermit&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Edition&quot; line. Disney released the film as the &quot;Nearly 35th Anniversary Edition&quot; on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on August 13, 2013. The film now streams in 4K Ultra HD on Disney+.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its first six days at the Leicester Square Theatre, it grossed $31,884. The film would later earn over $65 million in the United States and Canada, returning $32 million in box office rentals. For 32 years, &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; was the highest-grossing puppet film until the release of &quot;The Muppets&quot; in 2011.

The film&#x27;s successful theatrical release encouraged Lew Grade into furthering his own film distribution company, which later backfired with the massive box office failures of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; (from EMI) and &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; (from ITC), both released by Associated Film Distribution just a year later.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; currently holds an approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of , based on reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus says &quot;&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, the big-screen debut of Jim Henson&#x27;s plush creations, is smart, lighthearted, and fun for all ages.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film received highly positive reviews in the United States. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars. In his favorable review, he was fascinated that &quot;&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; not only stars the Muppets but, for the first time, shows us their feet.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; offered equal praise, stating that the film &quot;demonstrates once again that there&#x27;s always room in movies for unbridled amiability when it is governed by intelligence and wit.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;surely one of the summer&#x27;s most entertaining films,&quot; which &quot;does a fairly nice job of trying to be all things to all people. Which is not an easy job.&quot; Dale Pollock of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;The Muppet Movie&#x27; is a winner... Script by Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns incorporates the zingy one-liners and bad puns that have become the teleseries&#x27; trade mark, but also develops the Muppets themselves as thinking, feeling characters.&quot; Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote that &quot;with the exception of Brooks&#x27; wacky scene and Steve Martin&#x27;s funny bit as a snooty waiter, the cameo appearances by such stars as Bob Hope and Richard Pryor tend to slow the action down just as the bland musical numbers by Paul Williams and Kenny Asher interrupt the flow of the movie. Still &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; should entrance both young and old as the Muppets further endear themselves with their crazy antics, their playful puns and their very human characteristics.&quot; Rex Reed, in the same newspaper, reacted more enthusiastically to the film, remarking that &quot;if there&#x27;s any doubt, &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; will make believers and fans out of the worst pessimists. These lovable characters are so real and so endearing that I was never aware of the human hands making them work from mysterious hiding places. The Muppets made a wide-eyed, child out of me, and I hope they continue to do so until I&#x27;m in my wheelchair.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;as you might well expect, it is hip, funny, technically ingenious, fast-moving, melodious, richly produced, contemporary and equally and utterly beguiling to grown-ups and small persons.&quot; Katrine Ames of &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated, &quot;&#x27;The Muppet Movie&#x27; is a delectable grab bag of influences — stories by L. Frank Baum and Lewis Carroll, Westerns, the Crosby-Hope and Garland-Rooney movies — as well as its own inventive devices. The result is a kind of &#x27;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&#x27; with a plot attached. Its charm — and success — lie primarily in its loving pokes at Hollywood conventions and in the lovable characters who do the poking.&quot; John Skow of &quot;Time&quot; magazine offered a more mixed response, saying that &quot;the transition from the yank-&#x27;em-off-if-they-bomb lunacy of the TV show to the coherent narration of the film is not a complete success. Muppet magic remains a bewildering succession of wonderful bits, and perhaps the movie&#x27;s best occurs when Rowlf the Dog, who is a barroom pianist, commiserates with Kermit, who has just been deserted by Miss Piggy. The two sing a nice, rueful song about women—the can&#x27;t-live-with-them, can&#x27;t-live-without-them kind of thing.&quot;

Michael Hanton of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote that &quot;I was looking forward to a combination of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, and &quot;Intolerance&quot;. What I got was more like &quot;Gidget&quot;, &quot;The Great Race&quot; and &quot;Love Boat&quot;&quot;; he also remarked that Fozzie Bear stole the show from his favorite character, Miss Piggy.

In the United Kingdom, it received mixed to positive reviews. Tim Radford of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;another film spun slightly longer than it should have been&quot;, adding that &quot;the humour remains decently dry and self-deprecating throughout; on the other hand there isn&#x27;t nearly enough of it, and a good 40 or 50 minute idea is padded to the obligatory hour and a half with songs, travelogue, flashbacks and a certain amount of mooning about.&quot; Patrick Gibbs of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; remarked that &quot;after the Wombles moved, as they did recently, from the small screen to the big, so the Muppets inevitably follow, rather more successfully, I think, for James Frawley’s &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; is a clever construction.&quot; He also said that &quot;the style is cunningly varied at intervals by the appearance in virtually two-line parts of such people as Milton Berle, James Coburn, Dom DeLuise or Elliott Gould, not to mention Orson Welles, each in his own comic persona. Songs also help to add variety to a very hazardous undertaking; not at all to my taste, it comes off, I would say, as well as possible.&quot; Alexander Walker of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; supplied the film with its most positive review in the country, calling it &quot;the most original little show in town, and adding that it offered:

<doc id="876732" wikidata="Q339199" url="?curid=876732" title="Poincaré map">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in dynamical systems, a first recurrence map or Poincaré map, named after Henri Poincaré, is the intersection of a periodic orbit in the state space of a continuous dynamical system with a certain lower-dimensional subspace, called the Poincaré section, transversal to the flow of the system. More precisely, one considers a periodic orbit with initial conditions within a section of the space, which leaves that section afterwards, and observes the point at which this orbit first returns to the section. One then creates a map to send the first point to the second, hence the name &quot;first recurrence map&quot;. The transversality of the Poincaré section means that periodic orbits starting on the subspace flow through it and not parallel to it.

A Poincaré map can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system with a state space that is one dimension smaller than the original continuous dynamical system. Because it preserves many properties of periodic and quasiperiodic orbits of the original system and has a lower-dimensional state space, it is often used for analyzing the original system in a simpler way. In practice this is not always possible as there is no general method to construct a Poincaré map.

A Poincaré map differs from a recurrence plot in that space, not time, determines when to plot a point. For instance, the locus of the Moon when the Earth is at perihelion is a recurrence plot; the locus of the Moon when it passes through the plane perpendicular to the Earth&#x27;s orbit and passing through the Sun and the Earth at perihelion is a Poincaré map. It was used by Michel Hénon to study the motion of stars in a galaxy, because the path of a star projected onto a plane looks like a tangled mess, while the Poincaré map shows the structure more clearly.

== Definition ==
Let (R, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) be a global dynamical system, with R the real numbers, &quot;M&quot; the phase space and &quot;φ&quot; the evolution function. Let γ be a periodic orbit through a point &quot;p&quot; and &quot;S&quot; be a local differentiable and transversal section of &quot;φ&quot; through &quot;p&quot;, called a Poincaré section through &quot;p&quot;.

Given an open and connected neighborhood formula_1 of &quot;p&quot;, a function 
:formula_2
is called Poincaré map for the orbit γ on the Poincaré section &quot;S&quot; through the point &quot;p&quot; if
* &quot;P&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;
* &quot;P&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) is a neighborhood of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;P&quot;:&quot;U&quot; → &quot;P&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) is a diffeomorphism
* for every point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;U&quot;, the positive semi-orbit of &quot;x&quot; intersects &quot;S&quot; for the first time at &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
==Example==
Consider the following system of differential equations in polar coordinates, formula_3:
:formula_4
The flow of the system can be obtained by integrating the equation: for the formula_5 component we simply have
formula_6
while for the formula_7 component we need to separate the variables and integrate:
:formula_8
Inverting last expression gives
:formula_9
and since 
:formula_10
we find
:formula_11
The flow of the system is therefore
:formula_12
The behaviour of the flow is the following:
* The angle formula_5 increases monotonically and at constant rate.
* The radius formula_7 tends to the equilibrium formula_15 for every value.
Therefore, the solution with initial data formula_16 draws a spiral that tends towards the radius 1 circle.

We can take as Poincaré section for this flow the positive horizontal axis, namely
formula_17: obviously we can use formula_7 as coordinate on the section. Every point in formula_19 returns to the section after a time formula_20 (this can be understood by looking at the evolution of the angle): we can take as Poincaré map the restriction of formula_21 to the section formula_19 computed at the time formula_23, formula_24.
The Poincaré map is therefore :formula_25

The behaviour of the orbits of the discrete dynamical system formula_26 is the following:
* The point formula_27 is fixed, so formula_28 for every formula_29.
* Every other point tends monotonically to the equilibrium, formula_30 for formula_31.

== Poincaré maps and stability analysis ==

Poincaré maps can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system. The stability of a periodic orbit of the original system is closely related to the stability of the fixed point of the corresponding Poincaré map.

Let (R, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) be a differentiable dynamical system with periodic orbit γ through &quot;p&quot;. Let
:formula_2
be the corresponding Poincaré map through &quot;p&quot;. We define

:formula_33
:formula_34
:formula_35

and 

:formula_36

then (Z, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) is a discrete dynamical system with state space &quot;U&quot; and evolution function

:formula_37

Per definition this system has a fixed point at &quot;p&quot;.

The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is stable if and only if the fixed point &quot;p&quot; of the discrete dynamical system is stable.

The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is asymptotically stable if and only if the fixed point &quot;p&quot; of the discrete dynamical system is asymptotically stable.

<doc id="876733" wikidata="Q2660418" url="?curid=876733" title="Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation">
<text>is a Japanese multinational banking financial services institution owned by the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, which is also known as the SMBC Group. It is headquartered in the same building as SMBC Group in Marunouchi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. 

SMBC was established in 2001 through the merger of The Sakura Bank, which originated from the Mitsui zaibatsu and was founded as Mitsui Bank in 1876, and The Sumitomo Bank, which originated from the Sumitomo zaibatsu and was founded in 1895.

==Digital banking==

===IC cash card===
An IC cash card is a single cash card that can be used with three method of identification: biometric authentication, IC chip or magnetic stripe, by setting the limit and registering biometric information (finger vein pattern). With this cash card, the security of usage improved since transactions relies on IC chip recording data and the pattern of past transactions that combined IC chip recording data and biometric authentication.

As of 2017, SMBC issued IC cash cards at the bank&#x27;s counters (only applicable to ordinary design deposit cash cards; cards of other designs and non-savings accounts are not eligible for immediate issuance).

===Artificial Intelligence===

SMBC has been an early adopter of AI in its banking operation. It is the first Japanese bank to use IBM Watson since 2014 to support operators at its call center. AmiVoice, a voice recognition solution provided by SMBC, transforms inquiries into text on a real-time basis as a speech recognition system, while IBM Watson gives customers responses taken from service manuals and Q&amp;As, thereby allowing digital operators to provide timely and correct answers to callers.

==SMBC branch in Tokyo Disneyland==
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation is the only bank that has a branch office in Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. The branch is the legacy of Mitsui Bank, which was a member of the Mitsui Group when Oriental Land was established. Tokyo Disney Resort project was done by Mitsui Fudosan.

The branch office in Tokyo DisneySea has an unmanned ATM section called &quot;Nihonbashi Branch Tokyo DisneySea Branch&quot;, but staff are still assigned to the &quot;Urayasu Branch Tokyo Disneyland Branch&quot; (store number 593) in Tokyo Disneyland. The operating hours follow normal bank operational time. It was possible to open an account and no limitation of total handled customers, but now it is limited only to Urayasu citizens and related parties. The passbook design and the card design are not different from the one issued by ordinary SMBC&#x27;s branches and cannot be visually differentiated. Previously, the Disneyland branch office also handled foreign currency exchange.

Note, SMBC is not a participating company nor official sponsor of Tokyo Disney Resort. For instance, Disney characters have been used by the Bank of Mitsubishi UFJ as an image character for over half a century since it was adopted by Mitsubishi Bank in 1962.

<text>Dolls Point is a small suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Dolls Point is located 17 km south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the St George area. Dolls Point is in the local government area of the Bayside Council.

==History==
Dolls Point was originally a deserted landscape, which was considered uninhabitable. The origins of the name are unclear but legend has it that it was named for an escaped convict who took shelter in the dire landscape to hide from the authorities.

The area between Cooks River and Georges River was originally known as Seven Mile Beach. It was changed to Lady Robinsons Beach in 1874 to honour the wife of Governor Sir Hercules Robinson. Cook Park is named after Samuel Cook who advocated it as a public pleasure area.

Historic Primrose House became the Royal South Sydney Community Health Centre.

==Geography==
Dolls Point takes its name from the geographical formation on Botany Bay. Cook Park runs along the eastern border and the beach stretches from Dolls Point to Sandringham Bay. Dolls Point is a quiet residential suburb that has managed to maintain an uncluttered landscape. Its village feel makes it a family friendly neighbourhood. It is home to fine sailing, water views and abundant parkland. 

===Dolls Point beach===
One of the main attractions is &quot;Doll Point Beach&quot;, which has the whitest sand in Sydney. Fishing and kite surfing are popular activities in the beach. The beach sets out at the rock groyne and continues to the southwest for 550 metres past a seawall and a small tidal pool to a western deviation in the sandy shore at a groyne in front of a sailing club in Georges River. The beach is fairly precipitous and reflective, which is opposite of the deep 1 km wide river mouth to Towra Point.

==Commercial area==
A small group of shops, along with the Sans Souci Library, are located at the intersection of Clareville Avenue and Russell Avenue, on the border with Sans Souci and Sandringham.

==Population==
According to the of Population, there were 1,633 residents in Dolls Point. 60.2% of people were born in Australia. 57.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek at 12.0%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 23.3%, No Religion 21.4%, Eastern Orthodox 20.1%, Not stated 8.2% and Anglican 7.3%.

<doc id="876739" wikidata="Q6226121" url="?curid=876739" title="John Churchill Chase">
<text>John Churchill Chase (1905–1986) was a cartoonist and writer. He was known for his editorial cartoons and his works on the history of his native New Orleans and Louisiana in the United States.

==Career==

After high school in New Orleans, Chase attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. He worked as assistant cartoonist to Frank King at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; on the popular comic strip &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; and other cartoons, before returning to New Orleans in 1927 to become editorial cartoonist for the &quot;New Orleans Item&quot;. He would continue this role through 1964, by which time the newspaper had become &quot;The States-Item&quot;. Chase&#x27;s chief character in his cartoons was &quot;Mr. New Orleans&quot; or &quot;The Little Man&quot;, who was typically dressed in a 19th-century long coat with a top hat, bushy moustache and glasses.

He is the author of the book &quot;Frenchmen, Desire, Good Children and Other Streets of New Orleans&quot;. This book went through several popular editions from the 1960s through 1997, and has gone on to be widely acclaimed as a great chronicling of the history of New Orleans through the naming of its streets.

Chase&#x27;s other works include the book &quot;Louisiana Purchase: an American Story.&quot;

He composed editorial cartoons on television on WDSU during the 1960s. Other art works of his included a mural depicting the history of New Orleans in cartoons for the main branch of the New Orleans Public Library. In a departure from his usual work, in 1960 Chase produced a large &quot;Transfiguration&quot; in stained glass over the vestibule of St. Dominic Catholic Church in New Orleans.

Chase taught New Orleans history at Tulane University, sometimes collaborating with Pie Dufour on classroom instruction, and cartooning at the University of New Orleans. For many years, his cartoons graced the football game programs at Tulane University, which maintains an exhibit of his artworks for their football programs.

He also created cartoons and illustrations for projects outside of New Orleans. One of his notable projects was a series of cartoons featuring the Texas Longhorns&#x27; mascot &quot;Bevo&quot; for the University of Texas at Austin in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Tributes==
A small street in the New Orleans Central Business District was named &quot;John Churchill Chase&quot; after his death. This was a section of street formerly named Calliope (one of a series of streets in the area named after the Muses). This street runs perpendicular to the Mississippi River, through the New Orleans Warehouse District, about two blocks downriver (north, at this point) from the Crescent City Connection Bridge.

<doc id="876744" wikidata="Q8058700" url="?curid=876744" title="Younkers">
<text>Younkers Inc. () is an American online retailer and former department store chain founded as a family-run dry goods business in 1856 in Keokuk, Iowa. The retailer had evolved over more than 150 years to include a presence in locations throughout Iowa and bordering states in the Midwest region of the United States. Younkers became influential as it acquired several rivals throughout the 20th century both inside and outside of Iowa. The chain itself was sold by the late 1990s, with ownership transferring out of state, and its Des Moines-based headquarters closed by 2003 as a part of a corporate consolidation. Following its last sale in 2006, Younkers operated as a subsidiary of The Bon-Ton, with locations in seven Midwestern states, primarily in shopping malls. the chain operated more than fifty locations in the region. On August 29, 2018, Younkers closed its doors one last time.
== History ==

===Beginnings===

The company was founded by three Polish Jewish immigrant brothers Lipman, Samuel, and Marcus Younker, who opened a general store in Keokuk, Iowa, in 1856. Herman Younker, a younger half-brother to the three founders, opened a dry goods store in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1874. Following Samuel&#x27;s death in 1879, the Keokuk store was closed and the Des Moines location became the main store. The future novelist and newspaper editor Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd worked as a clerk at the Younkers store in Des Moines in 1889. In 1899 the Younker brothers&#x27; main store in downtown Des Moines was moved to 7th and Walnut Streets, and it operated at the same location for 106 years before closing on August 12, 2005. The downtown Des Moines store became known for its Tea Room restaurant, which opened in 1913 and closed shortly before the store did. It also installed Iowa&#x27;s first escalator, known as the &quot;electric stairs,&quot; in 1939.

=== Younkers Incorporated ===
A series of additions, enlargements, and mergers resulted in the company changing its name to Younkers Incorporated. The department store in downtown Des Moines was purchased in 1912. The company started growing in the 1920s by acquiring other department stores throughout Iowa, including Wilkins Department Stores (1923), Harris-Emery (1927), and J. Mandelbaum and Sons (1928). The Iowa-based retailers Brintnall&#x27;s of Marshalltown and Davidson&#x27;s of Sioux City were acquired in 1948 and Yetters of Iowa City was acquired in 1949. Younkers began expanding outside of Iowa during the 1950s and opened its first shopping mall store in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1955. (It acquired another Omaha department store, Kilpatrick&#x27;s, in 1961.) By 1978 Younkers had 28 stores in five states.

===Fires===
In November 1978, a fire broke out in the Younkers store in the Merle Hay Mall in Des Moines, killing 11 people. To date, it is the most devastating fire in Des Moines&#x27; history, and destroyed the original Younkers at the mall. It is also the third deadliest department store fire in US history. The fire was caused by faulty wiring.

In the early hours of March 29, 2014, a fire ravaged the former Younker Brothers Department Store in downtown Des Moines while it was under renovation. The eastern, original 1899 building partially collapsed in the fire and was demolished; the western 1909 Wilkins Department Store building, that Younker&#x27;s had expanded into in 1924, was still standing and undergoing renovation.

===Acquisitions of Brandeis and H.C. Prange===
Younkers was operated by the Equitable of Iowa insurance company from 1979 to 1992 after being a publicly traded company since 1948. Under Equitable&#x27;s ownership, Younkers acquired all 11 locations of the Omaha-based Brandeis department store chain in 1987. After returning to public ownership on the NASDAQ on April 22, 1992, Younkers purchased the 22 stores of the H.C. Prange chain in Wisconsin and Michigan.

===Acquisition by Proffitt&#x27;s===
After a hostile takeover bid by Carson Pirie Scott was rejected in 1995, Younkers&#x27; shareholders agreed to a friendly merger by Proffitt&#x27;s, Inc., of Knoxville, Tennessee. The merger was completed in December 1996. Proffitt&#x27;s would later acquire Carson Pirie Scott, and in 1998 Proffitt&#x27;s acquired Saks Fifth Avenue to form Saks Incorporated. In 2003, Saks closed Younkers&#x27; headquarters in Des Moines and merged its operations with those of Carson Pirie Scott in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

===Sale to The Bon-Ton===
Saks sold Younkers and its other Northern Department Store Group stores (Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner&#x27;s, Boston Store, and Herberger&#x27;s) to Bon-Ton Stores in a $1.1 billion (~$ in ) deal that was completed on March 6, 2006.

On January 31, 2018, Bon-Ton announced that they were going to close 42 locations nationwide including 9 in the state of Wisconsin between February and April 2018.

It was further announced on April 17, 2018 that Bon Ton Stores would be closing doors and began liquidating all 267 stores after two liquidators, Great American Group and Tiger Capital Group, won an auction for the company. The bid was estimated to be worth $775.5 million. This included all remaining Younkers locations after 162 years of operation. According to national retail reporter Mitch Nolen, stores closed within 10 to 12 weeks.

On August 29, 2018, Younkers closed its doors and shut down.

===Sale to BrandX.com, Inc===
On September 10, 2018, of Merrillville, Indiana-based CSG Generation acquired all trademark and intellectual property assets of The Bon-Ton (York, Pa.). Subsequently, in early 2021, CSC Generation sold all the acquired assets of Bon-Ton to New York-based BrandX.com in a private sale.

In May 2022 BrandX.com announced that Younkers would reopen with a physical location in 2023.

<text>:&quot;See Johanan (name) for more rabbis by this name&quot;.

Johanan bar Nappaha ( Yoḥanan bar Nafḥa or Napaḥa), also known simply as Rabbi Yochanan or Johanan [[Patronymic#Aramaic|bar]] Nafcha (180–279 CE), was a leading rabbi and second-generation &quot;Amora&quot; during the Talmudic era.

Johanan&#x27;s opinions are quoted widely across the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. The compilation of the Jerusalem Talmud is generally ascribed to him.

==Name==
He is generally cited as &quot;Johanan,&quot; but sometimes by his cognomen only, which he himself uses once; but he is never cited by both together.

Opinions vary on whether &quot;bar Nappaha&quot; (literally &quot;son [of the] blacksmith&quot;) derives from his father&#x27;s profession, from the name of his ancestral region, or perhaps represents a physical or psychological quality.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Johanan&#x27;s early years were spent in Sepphoris in the Roman-ruled Galilee (then part of Syria Palaestina province). He traced his descent from the tribe of Joseph. His father, a blacksmith, died prior to his birth, and his mother died soon after; he was raised by his grandfather in Sepphoris.

Judah ha-Nasi took the boy under his wing and taught him Torah. Due to the disparity in ages, though—Johanan was only fifteen years old when Judah died—Johanan was not one of Judah&#x27;s prime students; rather, he studied more under Judah&#x27;s students. It is said that initially he sat seventeen rows behind Abba Arikha in the school taught by Judah, and could not comprehend the discussions. In later life, Johanan recalled teachings that he had gleaned from the early Sages who moved to Usha. Hanina bar Hama taught him homiletic Bible interpretation—except of the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—and probably medicine, in which he became skilled.

He studied Torah diligently all his life, even selling a field house and an olive shed that he had inherited from his parents in order to be able to devote his time to study. As he expressed it, he exchanged the things that God created in six days for the things the delivery of which required forty days. After that was spent, he lived a life of poverty. For some time, he was compelled to work to support himself. But soon he felt impelled to return to his school, where he earned, not without a struggle, the encomiums of his masters. At last, owing to the universal homage paid to him, the patriarch accorded him a pension, and soon a lecturer&#x27;s place was found for him.

===Leadership===
In Sepphoris, Johanan quickly became popular for his lectures, with crowds flocking to hear him. 
However, Johanan moved to Tiberias at some point before Hanina&#x27;s death. The two had disagreed on two points of ritual, and Johanan, not wishing to oppose his master at his home, decided to move. It is doubtful whether they ever met again. However, Johanan maintained close relations with his other teachers to the end of their days. This was particularly the case with Hoshaiah Rabbah. He, too, moved from Sepphoris to Caesarea, where he opened a college and whither Johanan often went from Tiberias to consult him on difficult problems. Johanan continued these visits during the last 13 years of Hoshaiah&#x27;s life, but they were merely social visits, Johanan no longer needing Hoshaiah&#x27;s help: &quot;He that pays his respects to his teacher is considered as one waiting on the Divine Presence&quot;.

Rabbi Johanan was sitting [and] reading in the synagogue of the Babylonians in Sepphoris. There passed in front of him a governor [with the rank of] Minister, but he (R. Johanan) did not stand up before him. They sought to have him beaten. He (the governor) said to them: &#x27;Leave him alone. He was busy in what concerns the law (custom) of his Creator&#x27;.

In the 3rd-century CE, Johanan officiated in the synagogue of Maon and was called to render a decision in the case of a ritual slaughterer (&quot;shochet&quot;) who had improperly slaughtered a chicken and whether or not he was to be held liable on that account. Johanan opened an academy in Tiberias, and let anybody in if they wanted to learn, a controversial move at the time. The academy soon drew large numbers of gifted students, native and foreign, among them Abbahu, Rabbi Ammi, Rabbi Assi, Eleazar ben Pedat, Hiyya bar Abba, Jose bar Hanina, Shimon bar Abba, and Rabbi Isaac Nappaha. As many of his disciples accepted and taught his decisions, and as he himself visited and lectured at other places, his fame spread far and wide. In the Diaspora, whither his teachings were carried by his students, his authority was almost as great as in his native land, and few contemporary scholars in Babylonia opposed him. Johanan himself recognized no foreign authority except that of Rav, his senior schoolmate under Judah haNasi. Johanan kept up a correspondence with Rav, and addressed him as &quot;our master in Babylonia.&quot; After Rav&#x27;s death Johanan wrote to Rav&#x27;s colleague Samuel of Nehardea, but addressed him as &quot;our colleague in Babylonia.&quot; Samuel sent him a complete calendar covering the intercalations for a period of sixty years; Johanan, however, admitted merely that Samuel was a good mathematician. But when Samuel transmitted to him a mass of disquisitions on the dietary laws, Johanan exclaimed, &quot;I still have a master in Babylonia!&quot; He even resolved to pay him a visit, but rumor made him believe that Samuel had in the meantime died. Johanan was long considered the greatest rabbi in the Land of Israel, and after the deaths of Rav and Samuel, the greatest authority recognized by Babylonian Jews as well.
Because of the principle of &quot;halacha k&#x27;battra&#x27;i&quot; (the &quot;halachic&quot; ruling being according to the rabbi with the latest ordination from the Land of Israel in those days, felt to be uninterrupted from the direct line from the &quot;Sanhedrin&quot;), he is quoted so many times and one will notice that every &#x27;participant&#x27; in that discussion attempts to align themselves with his opinion. In a sense, once his name is mentioned in a discussion on halachic ruling, it &#x27;kills the discussion&#x27;, as his ruling are considered final.

===Personal details===
Johanan is the subject of many stories. He treated his servants with great kindness: &quot;Did not He that made me in the womb make him?&quot; He was blessed with many children, but lost ten sons. The last one is said to have died by falling into a caldron of boiling water. The bereft father preserved a joint of the victim&#x27;s little finger, which he exhibited to mourners in order to inspire resignation. &quot;This is a bone from the body of my tenth son,&quot; he would say. However, he himself was not resigned at the death of his brother-in-law Shimon ben Lakish, his fellow amora, whom he affectionately called &quot;my counterpart&quot;. He mourned for him long and deeply, weeping often and crying, &quot;Bar Lakish, where art thou? O Bar Lakish! &quot; At last he became melancholy, and for three years and a half could not attend his college; but it seems that he finally recovered his health and resumed his labors.

It is said that Johanan had an agreeable presence and a pleasing disposition; he was considered kind and considerate to the stranger as well as to his brethren; to the non-observant as to the pious; to the am ha&#x27;aretz as to the haver; for this he was beloved by his teachers and honored by all.

He is believed to have never left Israel in all his life, a rare feat for rabbis in those days, who frequently visited Babylonia.

He was known for being healthy and beautiful, and reportedly lived more than one hundred years. The Talmud relates of him: &quot;He that wishes to see the beauty of Rabbi Johanan, let him bring a silver chalice when it comes out of the silversmith&#x27;s refinery, and let him fill it with the red kernels of a pomegranate, and then let him adorn the chalice around its brim with red roses, and then place it between the sunlight and the shade. The emanating radiance would be somewhat similar to the beauty of Rabbi Johanan.&quot; He was accustomed to sit outside the mikveh in the evening, saying: &quot;Let the daughters of Israel look at me when they come up from the mikveh and their children will be as handsome as I am and they will learn Torah like I do.&quot; He then said a special verse so no jealousy or haughtiness would result from this.

===Death===
On his death-bed he ordered that he should be dressed neither in white nor in black, but in scarlet, so that on awaking after death he would not feel out of place in the company either of the pious or of the wicked.

Eleazar ben Pedat succeeded Yohanan as head of the Tiberias school.

==Teaching==
He thoroughly analyzed the Mishnah, discovering many contradictory decisions in it. He sought to reconcile these, but as that could not always be done, he perforce rejected many laws adopted in the Mishnah, preferring the authority of baraitas taught by his former masters Hiyya and Hoshaiah.

He established broad rules that apply in many cases; for example, he held that the &quot;halakha&quot; always follows a &quot;s&#x27;tam mishnah&quot; (an undisputed anonymous &quot;mishnah&quot;). He had rules for &quot;tanna&quot; (&quot;Mishnah teacher&quot;) to follow in cases of dispute. Some such laws had been formulated by others but had proved insufficient. Johanan, therefore, elaborated and supplemented them, and most of his rules are to this day considered authoritative. All of them were collected in the &quot;geonic&quot; period in the &quot;Order of the Tannaim and Amoraim&quot; (סדר תנאים ואמוראים; abridged, סתו&quot;א), which is ascribed to Nahshon ben Zadok of the ninth century.

Later Talmudists, seeing that Johanan&#x27;s name appears more frequently in the Gemara than anyone else&#x27;s, ascribed to him the compilation of the Jerusalem Talmud. Modern scholars believe that he began the compilation, which was not completed until over a century after him.

In his religious decisions, Johanan was comparatively liberal. He blamed the destruction of the Temple by the Romans on the strictness of rabbis when applying religious verdicts. He sided with Judah II in the repeal of the prohibition against using oil made by pagans. He permitted Greek to be studied by men (because it enabled them to defend themselves against informers) and by women (because familiarity with Greek was considered attractive in women). He allowed the painting of decorative figures on the walls. Under certain circumstances, he permitted emigration from Eretz Yisrael: &quot;If you are mentioned [nominated by the Romans] for office, make the Jordan your boundary friend [escape over the Jordan], even on a semiholiday&quot;.

He was one of the most prolific aggadists. Midrash Tehillim has, erroneously, been ascribed to him.

<doc id="876766" wikidata="Q2904859" url="?curid=876766" title="English Madrigal School">
<text>The English Madrigal School was the intense flowering of the musical madrigal in England, mostly from 1588 to 1627, along with the composers who produced them. The English madrigals were a cappella, predominantly light in style, and generally began as either copies or direct translations of Italian models. Most were for three to six voices.

==Style and characteristics==
Most likely the impetus for writing madrigals came through the influence of Alfonso Ferrabosco, who worked in England in the 1560s and 1570s in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s court; he wrote many works in the form, and not only did they prove popular but they inspired some imitation by local composers. The development that caused the explosion of madrigal composition in England, however, was the development of native poetry—especially the sonnet—which was conducive to setting to music in the Italian style. When Nicholas Yonge published &quot;Musica transalpina&quot; in 1588, it proved to be immensely popular, and the vogue for madrigal composition in England can be said to truly have started then.

&quot;Musica transalpina&quot; was a collection of Italian madrigals, mostly by Ferrabosco and Marenzio, fitted with English words. They were well-loved, and several similar anthologies followed immediately after the success of the first. Yonge himself published a second &quot;Musica transalpina&quot; in 1597, hoping to duplicate the success of the first collection.

While William Byrd, probably the most famous English composer of the time, experimented with the madrigal form, he never actually called his works madrigals, and shortly after writing some secular songs in madrigalian style returned to writing mostly sacred music.

The most influential composers of madrigals in England, and the ones whose works have survived best to the present day, were Thomas Morley, Thomas Weelkes and John Wilbye. Morley is the only composer of the time who set verse by Shakespeare for which the music has survived. His style is melodic, easily singable, and remains popular with &quot;a cappella&quot; singing groups. Wilbye had a very small compositional output, but his madrigals are distinctive with their expressiveness and chromaticism; they would never be confused with their Italian predecessors. 

The last line of Gibbons&#x27; &quot;The Silver Swan&quot; of 1612,
:&quot;More Geese than Swans now live, more Fools than Wise.&quot;
is often considered to be a lament for the death of the English tradition.

One of the more notable compilations of English madrigals was &quot;The Triumphs of Oriana&quot;, a collection of madrigals compiled by Thomas Morley, which contained 25 different madrigals by 23 different composers. Published in 1601 as a tribute to Elizabeth I of England, each madrigal contains a reference to Oriana, a name used to reference the Queen.

Madrigals continued to be composed in England through the 1620s, but the air and &quot;recitative music&quot; rendered the style obsolete; somewhat belatedly, characteristics of the Baroque style finally appeared in England. While the music of the English Madrigal School is of generally high quality and has endured in popularity, it is useful to remember that the total output of the composers was relatively small: Luca Marenzio in Italy alone published more books of madrigals than the entire sum of madrigal publications in England, and Philippe de Monte wrote more madrigals (over 1100) than were written in England during the entire period.

<text>The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation (Xerces Society) is a non-profit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates considered to be essential to biological diversity and ecosystem health. It is named in honor of an extinct California butterfly, the Xerces blue (&quot;Glaucopsyche xerces&quot;).

The Society collaborates with federal and state agencies including the US Department of Agriculture, as well as scientists, land managers, educators, and citizens to promote invertebrate conservation, applied research, advocacy, public outreach and education. Examples of Xerces Society activities include advocating for invertebrates and their habitats, petitioning for the designation of endangered status for applicable species such as the monarch butterfly,
and public education projects. Ongoing projects include the rehabilitation of habitat for endangered species, public education about the importance of native pollinators, and the restoration and protection of watersheds.

The organization was founded by butterfly scientist Robert Michael Pyle from Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies and was reincorporated with the Oregon Secretary of State on April 14, 1988.

== Initiatives ==

=== Bee City USA ===
The Xerces Society started the Bee City USA program to encourage cities to encourage native pollinators by planting more native plants, providing more pollinator habitats, and limiting unnecessary pesticide spraying.

=== Bee Campus USA ===
The Xerces Society started the Bee Campus USA program to include pollinator gardens in communities and campuses to provide habitats for local pollinators.

The following colleges and universities participate in the Bee Campus USA program.

== Litigation ==
In August 2024, the Xerces Society and Center for Biological Diversity won a lawsuit against the USDA&#x27;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) over its widespread use of pesticides to address grasshopper and cricket infestations over millions of acres across 17 western states.

<text>In mathematics, a group is said to be complete if every automorphism of is inner, and it is centerless; that is, it has a trivial outer automorphism group and trivial center.

Equivalently, a group is complete if the conjugation map, (sending an element to conjugation by ), is an isomorphism: injectivity implies that only conjugation by the identity element is the identity automorphism, meaning the group is centerless, while surjectivity implies it has no outer automorphisms.

== Examples ==
As an example, all the symmetric groups, , are complete except when }. For the case , the group has a non-trivial center, while for the case , there is an outer automorphism.

The automorphism group of a simple group is an almost simple group; for a non-abelian simple group , the automorphism group of is complete.

== Properties ==
A complete group is always isomorphic to its automorphism group (via sending an element to conjugation by that element), although the converse need not hold: for example, the dihedral group of 8 elements is isomorphic to its automorphism group, but it is not complete. For a discussion, see .

== Extensions of complete groups ==

Assume that a group is a group extension given as a short exact sequence of groups

with kernel, , and quotient, . If the kernel, , is a complete group then the extension splits: is isomorphic to the direct product, . A proof using homomorphisms and exact sequences can be given in a natural way: The action of (by conjugation) on the normal subgroup, , gives rise to a group homomorphism, . Since and has trivial center the homomorphism is surjective and has an obvious section given by the inclusion of in . The kernel of is the centralizer of in , and so is at least a semidirect product, , but the action of on is trivial, and so the product is direct.

This can be restated in terms of elements and internal conditions: If is a normal, complete subgroup of a group , then is a direct product. The proof follows directly from the definition: is centerless giving is trivial. If is an element of then it induces an automorphism of by conjugation, but and this conjugation must be equal to conjugation by some element of . Then conjugation by is the identity on and so is in and every element, , of is a product in .

<text>Black moon is a term first recorded in 2016. It is not a term used in astronomy. No single, universally accepted definition exists. Among the meanings ascribed to it are these: a second new moon that appears in the same month; the third new moon in an astronomical season with four new moons; the absence of a new moon in February; or the absence of a full moon in February. 

== Definitions, frequency, dates ==
=== Month with two new moons ===
One use of the term is for the occurrence of a second new moon in a calendar month. This is analogous to the by-month definition of a blue moon as the second full moon in a month. February is too short for a second new moon to occur. This event occurs about every 29 months.

The assignment of a calendar date to a new moon, and in which month a second new moon occurs, depends on the time zone. For example, the new moon of 2016-10-01T00:11 UTC occurs on 1 October for Europe, Asia and Oceania, making it the first of two new moons in October. However, for the Americas the date is still 30 September, making this the second new moon of September.

Calculated in UTC, instances of a second new moon in a calendar month between 2010 and 2020 are:

* 2011-07-30
* 2014-01-30
* 2014-03-30
* 2016-10-30
* 2019-08-30

=== Season with four new moons ===
Another use of the term is for the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This is analogous to the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; definition of a blue moon as the third full moon in a season with four full moons. A season lasts about three months and usually has three new moons. This event occurs about every 33 months.

There is no dependency on time zones in this definition as the seasons are tied to the winter solstice. Instances of four new moons in a season are:

* 2012-05-20 
* 2015-02-18 
* 2017-08-21 
* 2020-05-22 or 2020-08-19. This depends on the exact definition of the seasons: If northern summer is deemed to begin at the June solstice then the 2020-06-21 new moon occurs in northern summer. If the seasons are defined in quarter tropical years from the December solstice then the 2020-06-21 new moon occurs in northern spring.

=== Month without full moon ===
Another use of the term is for the absence of the full moon from a calendar month. This can occur only in February; it happens about every 19 years. When February is without full moon, then the preceding December or January &quot;and&quot; the following March or April will have two full moons each.

As with the case of two new moons in a month, whether a black moon by this definition occurs depends on the time zone. Calculated in UTC, instances of a month without full moon between 1990 and 2040 are:

* February 1999
* February 2018
* February 2037

=== Month without new moon ===
Another use of the term is for the absence of the new moon in a calendar month. This can occur only in February; it happens about every 19 years. When February is without new moon, then the preceding December or January and the following March or April will have two new moons.

As with the case of two new moons in a month, whether a black moon by this definition occurs depends on the time zone. Calculated in UTC, instances of a month without new moon between 1990 and 2040 are:
* February 1995
* February 2014

* February 2033

== Paganism ==
In some aspects of paganism, particularly amongst Wiccans, the black moon is considered to be a special time when any rituals, spells, or other workings are considered to be more powerful and effective. Others believe rituals or workings should not be conducted at these times.

==Criticism of terminology==
* The term &quot;black moon&quot; is not formally established in astronomy and is used at best in the popularization of astronomy.
* There is no single definition of the term &quot;black moon&quot;.
* The new moon itself cannot be observed.
* The lack of a new or full moon in February can only be assigned to the month, not to any particular date; as such, this is also not observable.
* The event of a black moon is an artefact of how the Gregorian calendar or the seasons map onto lunations. There is no physical or geometric difference between a black moon and other instances of a new moon.

<text>A wet moon (also called a Cheshire moon) is the visual phenomenon when the &quot;horns&quot; of the crescent Moon point up at an angle, away from the horizon, so that the crescent takes on the appearance of a bowl or smile. A wet moon occurs when the crescent Moon is low above the horizon and at a point more or less directly above the Sun&#x27;s (invisible) position below the horizon. This in turn is determined by the positions of the Moon and Earth in their respective orbits, the inclinations of these orbits relative to one another and to Earth&#x27;s celestial equator, and the observer&#x27;s latitude on Earth. Wet moons occur routinely in the tropics (where the Sun and Moon rise and set nearly vertically), but rarely in the polar regions (where the Sun and Moon rise and set at a glancing angle or not at all).

By contrast, a dry moon is one where the crescent of the moon is at any other angle.

==Name==

The terms &quot;wet moon&quot; and &quot;dry moon&quot; originate from Hawaiian mythology, where it was thought that the Moon appeared as a bowl that would fill up with rainwater. The period when this is most common, January 20 to February 18, corresponds with Kaelo the Water Bearer in Hawaiian astrology and makes the Moon known as the &quot;dripping wet moon&quot;. As summer comes, the crescent shape shifts, pouring out the water and causing the summer rains. After the &quot;bowl&quot; empties, it dries out and rights itself, creating the &quot;dry moon&quot;. However, others say that this is a wet moon because it permitted the water to pour out.

The term &quot;Cheshire moon&quot; is a reference to the smile of the Cheshire Cat from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

==Explanation==
The annual path that the Sun appears to follow against the background of relatively fixed stars is known as the ecliptic. Since the Moon&#x27;s orbit is inclined 5.14° to the ecliptic, the Moon will always remain within about 5° north or south of the ecliptic. For half of a sidereal month (with respect to the stars), the Moon is either north or south of the ecliptic. The two points where the Moon&#x27;s orbit intersects that of Earth are called the lunar nodes; at the ascending node, the Moon moves north of the ecliptic, while at the descending node, it moves south. Eclipses occur at these points, hence the name &quot;ecliptic&quot;. The nodes precess around the ecliptic axis at the rate of one circuit every 18.6 years. The ecliptic makes the steepest angle to the horizon at the equinoxes. Since the crescent Moon appears near the Sun, the crescent would appear to lie on its back when low above the horizon around the equinoxes.

<text>Wan Ok Phansa (, ; literally &quot;day of going out of Vassa&quot;, ออก in Thai meaning exit or leave) is the last day of the Thai-Lao observance of Vassa. It occurs in October, three lunar months after the beginning of Vassa, known as &quot;Wan Khao Phansa&quot; ().

The day is celebrated in the Isan province by illuminated boat processions ( &quot;lai ruea fai&quot; , &quot;lai huea fai&quot; ), notably in Nakhon Phanom Province on the Mekong and in Ubon Ratchathani city on the Mun River.

The main ceremonies feature boats of 8–10 metres in length, formerly made of banana wood or bamboo but now sometimes of other materials. The boats are filled with offerings such as &quot;khao tom&quot; (glutinous rice sweets wrapped in banana leaves) and decorated on the outside with flowers, candles and lamps. The boats are launched in the evening.

Additionally, some celebrants individually launch their own, smaller, vessels. Boat races also take place around this time in many places throughout the country as a way to please the Nāga spirits.
Along the Mekong River, people launch little hot air balloons, acting as lanterns, around the night of Wan Ok Phansa.

Launching the boats (or the lanterns) symbolizes one&#x27;s wishes but also getting rid of unnecessary negative feelings.

==Etymology==

&quot;Wan&quot; () means &quot;day&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot; () means &quot;to exit; to leave&quot;, and Phansa () is the Thai word for Vassa.

<doc id="876827" wikidata="Q2285362" url="?curid=876827" title="Band society">
<text>A band society, sometimes called a camp, or in older usage, a horde, is the simplest form of human society. A band generally consists of a small kin group, no larger than an extended family or clan. The general consensus of modern anthropology sees the average number of members of a social band at the simplest level of foraging societies with generally a maximum size of 30 to 50 people.

==Origins of usage in anthropology==
&#x27;Band&#x27; was one of a set of three terms employed by early modern ethnography to analyse aspects of hunter-gatherer foraging societies. The three were respectively &#x27;horde,&#x27; &#x27;band&#x27;, and &#x27;tribe&#x27;. The term &#x27;horde&#x27;, formed on the basis of a Turkish/Tatar word &quot;úrdú&quot; (meaning &#x27;camp&#x27;), was inducted from its use in the works of J. F. McLennan by Alfred William Howitt and Lorimer Fison in the mid-1880s to describe a geographically or locally defined division within a larger tribal aggregation, the latter being defined in terms of social divisions categorized in terms of descent. Their idea was then developed by A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, as a model for all Australian indigenous societies, the horde being defined as a group of parental families whose married males all belonged to the one patrilineal clan. &#x27;Horde&#x27; from the outset bore stereotypical connotations of Australian Aboriginal societies as primitive, closed, rigid and simple, and came to be discarded not only for its implication of &#x27;swarming savages&#x27; but also because it suggested a fixed tribal-territorial entity which compromised the actual field data, the field data allowing for a far more fluid concept of the group.

In 1936, Julian Steward reformulated Radcliffe Brown&#x27;s highly restrictive definition, by proposing the idea of a band society at the hunter-gatherer level which could be patrilineal, matrilineal or a composite of both. Over time, &#x27;band&#x27; has tended to replace the earlier word &#x27;horde&#x27; as more extensive comparative work on hunter-gatherer societies shows they are not classifiable as simply closed patrilineal groups, and better approached in terms of a notion of a flexible, non-exclusive social band, having bilateral relations for marriage and other purposes with similar groups in a circumscribed territory.

In 1962, Les Hiatt invalidated Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s theory of the horde, demonstrating that the empirical evidence from Aboriginal societies contradicted Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s proposal that hordes are always based on patrilineal descent.

The word &quot;band&quot; is also used in North America, for example among the indigenous peoples of the Great Basin. With African hunter-gatherers, for instance among the Hadza, the term &quot;camp&quot; tends to be used.

== Characteristics ==
Bands have a loose organization. They can split up (in spring/summer) or group (in winter camps), as the Inuit, depending on the season, or member families can disperse to join other bands. Their power structure is generally egalitarian. The best hunters would have their abilities recognized, but such recognition did not lead to the assumption of authority, as pretensions to control others would be met by disobedience. Judgments determined by collective discussion among the elders were formulated in terms of custom, as opposed to the law-governed and coercive agency of a specialized body, as occurred with the rise of the more complex societies that arose upon the establishment of agriculture.

==Definitions and distinctions==
A. R. Radcliffe-Brown defined the horde as a fundamental unit of Australian social organizations according to the following five criteria:
# It denotes people who customarily share the same camp and lifestyle.
# It is the primary landowner of a given territory.
# Each horde was independent and autonomous, regulating its social life by a camp-council, generally under the direction of a headman.
# Children pertained to the father&#x27;s horde
# A unified horde identity was affirmed in all relations with external tribes.

In his 1975 study, &quot;The Notion of the Tribe&quot;, Morton Fried defined bands as small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak leadership that do not generate surpluses, pay taxes or support a standing army.

Bands are distinguished from tribes in that tribes are generally larger, consisting of many families. Tribes have more social institutions, such as a chief, big man, or elders. Tribes are also more permanent than bands; a band can cease to exist if only a small group splits off or dies. Many tribes are subdivided into bands. On occasion hordes or bands with common backgrounds and interests could unite as a tribal aggregate in order to wage war, as with the San, or they might convene for collective religious ceremonies, such as initiation rites or to feast together seasonally on an abundant resource as was common in Australian aboriginal societies. Among the Native Americans of the United States and the First Nations of Canada, some tribes are made up of official bands that live in specific locations, such as the various bands of the Ojibwa tribe.

== Examples ==
Band societies historically were found throughout the world, in a variety of climates, but generally, as civilisations arose, were restricted to sparsely populated areas, tropical rainforests, tundras and deserts. With the spread of the modern nation-state around the globe there are few true band societies left. Some historical examples include the Shoshone of the Great Basin in the United States, the San people of Southern Africa, the Mbuti of the Ituri Rainforest in Central Africa, and many groups of indigenous Australians, such as the Pitjantjatjara from Central Australia and the Palawa from Tasmania.

<doc id="876840" wikidata="Q369424" url="?curid=876840" title="Bobcat Goldthwait">
<text>Robert Francis &quot;Bobcat&quot; Goldthwait (born May 26, 1962) is an American comedian, actor, director, and screenwriter. He is known for his black comedy stand-up act, delivered through an energetic stage persona with an unusual raspy and high-pitched voice. He came to prominence with his stand-up specials &quot;An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait—Share the Warmth&quot; and &quot;Bob Goldthwait—Is He Like That All the Time?&quot; and his acting roles, including Zed in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; franchise and Eliot Loudermilk in &quot;Scrooged&quot;. Since 2012, he has been a regular panelist on the radio-quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;.

Goldthwait has written and directed a number of films and television series, most notably the black comedies &quot;Shakes the Clown&quot; (1991), in which he also starred, &quot;Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot; (2006), &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot; (2009), &quot;God Bless America&quot; (2011), and the horror film &quot;Willow Creek&quot; (2013); episodes of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; (2004–07), and &quot;Maron&quot; (2013–15); and several stand-up specials, including &quot;Patton Oswalt: Tragedy Plus Comedy Equals Time&quot; (2014).

He has also worked extensively as a voice actor, with voice roles in &quot;Capitol Critters&quot; (1992–95), &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997), and &quot;&quot; (1998–99), and has provided the voice of Pop Fizz in the &quot;Skylanders&quot; video game series since the character&#x27;s debut in 2012&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Robert Francis Goldthwait was born on May 26, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, the son of Kathleen Ann (Welch), a department store employee, and Thomas Lincoln Goldthwait, a sheet metal worker. He was raised in a working-class Catholic family.

At an early age, Goldthwait decided on a career as a comedian, inspired by enjoying making his friends laugh. During his time at St. Matthew&#x27;s Grammar School, Goldthwait would host performances for his friends regularly, among them being future voice actor Tom Kenny. Goldthwait would experiment with new content, and developed a strong liking for props.

&quot;I had nuns for all my grammar school, and there I was just told that I was not funny and that I was fat—it was just my first dealings with critics, actually. And I really did. I had like a nun telling me I was fat. It’s no wonder as an adult I had &quot;manorexia&quot; for, like, ten years. And then in high school I still went to a Catholic school but I had these teachers that were kind of very encouraging. You know, Tom Kenny and myself were doing stand-up comedy when we were fifteen. I remember in physics class falling asleep, and the physics teacher going &quot;Well, you know, they did a show last night, and they’re on another journey,&quot; and the guy was cool with it, you know? And I had an English teacher that was the same way: Santo Berlotti, who was very encouraging of me writing and stuff.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grouchoreviews/298&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Goldthwait and Kenny graduated from Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School in East Syracuse, New York. They formed a comedy troupe called The Generic Comics. In their mid-teens, they saw an ad for an open-mic night in Skaneateles that featured comedian Barry Crimmins with the moniker &quot;Bear Cat&quot;. He and Kenny went to the event and performed under the monikers Bobcat and Tomcat, respectively, as a tribute to Crimmins. Early in his career, Goldthwait also co-wrote with Martin Olson, who is listed as writer on his first two comedy specials &quot;Share the Warmth&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Watch This Show&quot;.

In 1984 he co-starred in the George Carlin HBO TV show Apt. 2C of which only the pilot episode was ever made.

==Career==
===Stand-up===
Goldthwait became recognized as a solo stand-up comedian and had a record &quot;Meat Bob&quot; and two televised concert specials in the 1980s: &quot;An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait —Share the Warmth&quot; and &quot;Bob Goldthwait —Is He Like That All the Time?&quot; He became known for his unique brand of comedy, which combines elements of political satire and often bizarre or unsettling black comedy.

In the 1990s, Goldthwait and Robin Williams appeared on the same bill together, but not as a comedy team, using the names &quot;Jack Cheese&quot; and &quot;Marty Fromage&quot;. Later, Goldthwait used the name Jack Cheese when he appeared in &quot;Tapeheads&quot;. When Williams made a cameo as Mime Jerry in Goldthwait&#x27;s &quot;Shakes the Clown&quot;, he was billed as &quot;Marty Fromage&quot;.

&quot;Q:Tell me a little bit about Jack Cheese and Marty Fromage.A:Well, all that was is Robin and I would perform sometimes—like, sometimes I would perform as Jack Cheese, and honestly, this is twenty years ago, when me showing up at a club would actually be something you’d have to keep on the downlow. Now, you put my real name there, and there’s still plenty of empty seats. So it&#x27;s when Robin and I would go out here in the Bay Area and do comedy, and we would just be performing under fake names just because of other concert obligations and stuff. So it was just so we could go out and write, yeah.&quot; (2009)

During the fall of 1993, Goldthwait performed stand-up material as an opening act for Nirvana on what would be their final North American tour. He had been selected for the slot due to frontman Kurt Cobain being a fan of his comedy, and the two developed a friendship over the course of the tour. He also appeared in a promo video for the band&#x27;s album &quot;In Utero&quot; and once fooled an interviewer during a phone interview, impersonating Dave Grohl. At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1993, Goldthwait rappelled nude from a catwalk of the stage at the Oakland Coliseum as Kurt Cobain led a countdown.

Goldthwait filmed a half-hour HBO special in 1995, and another comedy album in 2003 &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mean to Insult You, But You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait&quot; and in 2004 his stand-up was featured in Comedy Central&#x27;s animated series &quot;Shorties Watchin&#x27; Shorties&quot;. 

===Acting===
Goldthwait has appeared in several films. His first major role was Zed in the &quot; Police Academy&quot; franchise. He starred in &quot;One Crazy Summer&quot;, &quot;Burglar&quot;, &quot;Scrooged&quot;, and &quot;Hot to Trot&quot;. In 1992, Goldthwait directed, wrote, and starred in &quot;Shakes the Clown&quot;. He also made an appearance as a writer in &quot;Radioland Murders&quot;.

In 1985, Goldthwait appeared in Twisted Sister&#x27;s official video to &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; and &quot;Be Chrool to Your Scuel&quot; from &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;.

In 1992, Goldthwait appeared as a guest-co-host of the second episode of &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;. He appeared as a relative of Peggy Bundy on the &quot;Married... with Children&quot; show where he and his wife dropped one of their numerous offspring on the Bundys. Later in 1992, Goldthwait was a guest star as an excitable and peculiar psychiatrist in the second episode, season one of the sitcom, &quot;Golden Palace&quot; (starring Betty White, 
Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty, Don Cheadle, and Cheech Marin).

===Talk show guest appearance controversies===
In 1993, Goldthwait appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, where he tossed furniture and ran around the set, then into the audience.

In April 1994, as a guest on one of the last episodes of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, Goldthwait became demonstrably upset that the program was being canceled. At the time, it was widely believed that Paramount Studios had refused to renew Hall&#x27;s contract because &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; was moving to CBS, and Goldthwait took his anger out on Paramount. He stood on the set&#x27;s couch, spray-painted &quot;Paramount Sucks&quot; on a glass wall, and threw video equipment around the studio. Hall was forced to try to restrain Goldthwait and security was called to the set.

On May 9, 1994, Goldthwait appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, where he briefly lit the guest chair on fire using lighter fluid and a lighter. As a result, he became the first Tonight Show guest to be charged with a crime for what he did on the show. He was fined $2,700 plus the cost of the chair ($698); he was also required to tape several public-service announcements about fire safety. Despite banishment rumors, Leno invited Goldthwait to appear seven days later for a bit with Goldthwait buried up to his neck in dirt.

In August 1994, these incidents were the basis of the plot of his subsequent appearance on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, in which the fictional talk show hires him in the hope of improving the show&#x27;s ratings if he does another stunt.

These incidents also inspired a &quot;MadTV&quot; pseudo-PSA on fire safety.

=== Later work ===
Goldthwait was in four episodes of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;: &quot;Bobcat&quot;, &quot;Surprise&quot;, &quot;Anniversary&quot;, and an uncredited appearance in the episode &quot;Kentucky Nightmare&quot;.

One of the most recognizable features of Goldthwait&#x27;s performances is his voice. He has voiced characters on the television series &quot;Capitol Critters&quot; (1992), &quot;The Moxy Show&quot; (1993–1995), &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot; (1995–1999), &quot;The Tick&quot; (1995), &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;&quot; (1998–1999), &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot; (2003–2006), and &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; (2000). Goldthwait has also appeared as himself hosting the comedy quiz show &quot;Bobcat&#x27;s Big Ass Show&quot; (1998). Goldthwait was also a semi-regular guest in the later seasons of the Tom Bergeron-version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 1998.
Goldthwait was a featured guest on the August 20, 2009, episode of Adam Carolla&#x27;s podcast. And on August 26, 2009, he returned to guest on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; with old friend Robin Williams, during which he revealed a tattoo on his buttocks of an anthropomorphized cymbal with a mustache and slanted eyes (a pun on the Chinese symbol tattoo).

Goldthwait appeared in September 2010 on an episode of &quot;LA Ink&quot;, where shop owner Kat Von D gave him a tattoo of a potato, impaled on a fork, on his upper right arm. Goldthwait chose the design to remind himself of where he came from and to tell close friends and family that he had not lost his sense of humor. He also displayed his older tattoo of a cymbal with a moustache on his buttocks.

Goldthwait appeared on the May 4, 2012, episode of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;. Goldthwait was a voice guest in Season 4 of &quot;Adventure Time,&quot; voicing Ed in the episode &quot;Web Weirdos&quot;. Goldthwait appeared on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; on May 12, 2012, to talk about his film &quot;God Bless America&quot; and play the game &quot;Not My Job&quot; (he won). He then made his debut as one of the show&#x27;s panelists on the July 14, 2012.

In 2012, he voiced a character known as Pop Fizz, an overexcited gremlin chemist with the ability to drink his potion and become a rampaging monster, for the hit video game series &quot;Skylanders&quot;, starting with &quot;&quot;. Pop Fizz appeared in &quot;&quot; as Super Gulp Pop Fizz, &quot;&quot; as Fizzy Frenzy Pop Fizz, and &quot;&quot; as Big Bubble Pop Fizz. He later reprised the role of Pop Fizz in the 2016 Netflix series &quot;Skylanders Academy&quot;. The show ended in 2018.

===Directing===
Goldthwait began directing &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2004. While there, ratings for the show increased to over 2 million viewers per night, and jumped 50% with teens; however, in May 2006 Goldthwait left to pursue his film career. Goldthwait maintains contact with Kimmel and still directs for television and film. He returned to directing segments for &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in the summer of 2007.

====&quot;Shakes the Clown&quot;====
&quot;Shakes the Clown&quot; is a dark comedy about a birthday-party clown (Goldthwait) in the grip of depression and alcoholism, who is framed for murder. Different communities of clowns, mimes and other performers are depicted as clannish, rivalrous subcultures obsessed with precedence and status. This was Goldthwait&#x27;s bitter satire of the dysfunctional standup comedy circuit he knew as a performer.

====&quot;Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot;====
Goldthwait&#x27;s third feature film &quot;Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot; (originally titled &quot;Stay&quot;) starring Melinda Page Hamilton was in the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was part of the &quot;Independent Dramatic Features&quot; competition. &quot;Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot; is about a youthful, impulsive instance of oral sex performed on a dog which opens the door to a black comedy about the complexities of honesty. It was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the &quot;Dramatic Features&quot; category. The film was bought by Roadside Attractions &amp; Samuel Goldwyn Films at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival for the North American rights to the film, and was released on October 20, 2006. Gaumont bought the international rights to the film. It was released on February 21, 2007, by Gaumont in France, and on March 16, 2007, in the UK. On May 4, 2007, it was presented as John Waters&#x27; annual selection of a favorite film within Maryland Film Festival.

====&quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot;====
Goldthwait&#x27;s fourth feature film, &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot;, was released on July 24, 2009, on video-on-demand providers before its limited theatrical release on August 21. It starred Robin Williams, Daryl Sabara, and Alexie Gilmore. The web site for the 2009 Sundance Film Festival described it as a &quot;lusciously perverse, and refreshingly original comedy that tackles love, loss, and our curious quest for infamy&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot; 3 out of 4 stars, but commented that the material could have been even darker in its satire, and he questioned whether it was the director&#x27;s intention.

====&quot;God Bless America&quot;====
&quot;God Bless America&quot; premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and screened within Maryland Film Festival 2012.

====&quot;Willow Creek&quot;====
&quot;Willow Creek&quot; premiered at the 2013 Independent Film Festival of Boston and screened within such festivals as Maryland Film Festival. The film made its debut on the West Coast at the Arcata Theatre Lounge in Arcata, California, on May 31, 2013, near its filming location of Willow Creek, California.

On July 20, 2013, &quot;Willow Creek&quot; had its international premier at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal.

In 2017, &quot;American Bigfoot&quot;, Goldthwait&#x27;s short documentary about the Ohio Bigfoot Conference featured Alexie Gilmore and Bryce Johnson of &quot;Willow Creek&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rei/bigfoot-barackman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Call Me Lucky&quot;====
In 2015, Goldthwait premiered &quot;Call Me Lucky&quot;, his documentary on the life and work of comedian/activist Barry Crimmins, at the Sundance Film Festival.

====&quot;Joy Ride&quot;====
In August 2019, Goldthwait and fellow comedian Dana Gould set out to film their two-person stand-up show, but the project was postponed when the pair were in an auto accident on the way to the first performance. After recovering, they were able to film four shows in February 2020. Joy Ride was released in October 2020 and received a 100% from Rotten Tomatoes.

===&quot;Misfits &amp; Monsters&quot;===
On July 11, 2018, Goldthwait&#x27;s anthology television series &quot;Bobcat Goldthwait&#x27;s Misfits &amp; Monsters&quot; premiered on truTV.

<text>Bezalel ben Abraham Ashkenazi () ( 1520 – 1592) was a rabbi and talmudist who lived in Ottoman Israel during the 16th century. He is best known as the author of the Shitah Mekubetzet, a commentary on the Talmud. Among his disciples were Isaac Luria and Solomon Adeni.

== Biography ==
Ashkenazi was one of the leading Eastern Talmudists and rabbis of his day. He was probably born in Palestine. Descended from a family of German scholars, most of his life was spent in Egypt Eyalet, where he received his Talmudic education from David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra and Israel de Curial. During the lifetime of his teachers, Ashkenazi was regarded as one of the highest authorities in the Orient, and counted Isaac Luria and Solomon Adeni among his pupils. In Egypt his reputation was such that he could abrogate the dignity of the nagid, which had existed for centuries and had gradually deteriorated into an arbitrary aristocratic privilege. When, in 1587, a dispute occurred in Jerusalem over the extent to which scholars not engaged in business should contribute to the taxes paid by the Jewish community to the pasha, Ashkenazi, together with several other rabbis, took the stand that Jewish scholars, being usually impelled by love alone to emigrate to Palestine, and being scarcely able to support themselves, should be relieved from all taxes.

In the same year, Ashkenazi travelled to Palestine, settling in Jerusalem, where he was recognized as important by both Sephardic and Ashkenazi communities. The conditions in Jerusalem were at this time very critical; and it was mainly due to Ashkenazi&#x27;s influence that the congregations of the city were not dissolved. German Jews, who normally did not recognize the jurisdiction of the Sephardim and who, being largely scholars, refused to pay the Jews&#x27; tax, nevertheless recognized Ashkenazi&#x27;s authority. However this arrangement between the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim seems to have been solely due to the personal influence of Ashkenazi; asvit ended immediately after his death.

== &quot;Shitah Mekubezet&quot; ==
Ashkenazi is known principally as the author of &quot;Shitah Mekubezet&quot; (, &quot;Gathered Interpretation&quot;). This work, as its title indicates, is a collection of glosses on the greater part of the Talmud, in the style of the &quot;Tosafot&quot;, including much original and foreign material. The great value of the &quot;Shitah&quot; lies principally in the fact that it contains numerous excerpts from Talmudic commentaries which have not otherwise been preserved.

Ashkenazi himself wrote only short marginal annotations in his edition of the Talmud. Solomon Adeni, his student, edited the annotations into the commentary to Kodashim as it exists today (both versions), including a vast quantity of original material.

&quot;Shitah Mekubezet&quot; contains expositions of the Talmud taken from the works of the Spaniards Nahmanides, ben Adret, and Yom-Tov of Seville, and from those of the Frenchmen Abraham ben David, Baruch ben Samuel, Isaac of Chinon, etc. The study of the &quot;Shitah&quot; is particularly valuable for understanding the Tosafists, because the work contains some of the older and unedited &quot;Tosafot&quot;; besides, glosses of Asher ben Jehiel and of the disciples of Perez ben Elijah are partly contained in it.

==Other works==
Ashkenazi is also the author of a collection of responsa, which appeared after his death (Venice, 1595).

His &quot;Methodology of the Talmud,&quot; and his marginal notes to the Jerusalem Talmud, which were still extant at the time of Chaim Joseph David Azulai, are preserved in manuscript at Jerusalem.

<text>Kelmscott is a village and civil parish on the River Thames in West Oxfordshire, about east of Lechlade in neighbouring Gloucestershire. Since 2001 it has absorbed Little Faringdon, which had been a separate civil parish. The 2011 Census recorded the merged parish&#x27;s population as 198.

==Kelmscott Manor==

Kelmscott Manor is a Cotswold stone house, built in about 1570 during the Great Rebuilding of England and extended late in the 17th century. It was the country home of William Morris from 1871 until his death in 1896. He drew great inspiration from the unspoilt authenticity of the house&#x27;s architecture and craftsmanship, and its organic relationship with its setting. Kelmscott Manor now belongs to the Society of Antiquaries of London. Morris renamed his London town house Kelmscott House after Kelmscott when he bought it in April 1879. He named his private press, which he started in 1891, Kelmscott Press.

==Parish church==
The nave of the Church of England parish church of Saint George was built in about 1190 in the transitional style between Norman and Early English, and the chancel is probably of the same date. The building has transepts that were added in about 1260. The clerestory of the nave was added in the 15th century. Many of the windows of the nave and chancel are Perpendicular Gothic additions, including the east window of the chancel. The church is a Grade II* listed building. 

In the churchyard is the tomb of William Morris, designed by Philip Webb. Morris featured the church in his novel &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;, when in the final part of the book the Guest is taken there for the feast. St George&#x27;s parish is now part of the Benefice of Shill Valley and Broadshire, which includes also the parishes of Alvescot, Black Bourton, Broadwell, Broughton Poggs, Filkins, Holwell, Kencot, Langford, Little Faringdon, Shilton and Westwell. In the village, next to the pub The Plough Inn, are the remains of a 14th or 15th century cross.

<doc id="876849" wikidata="Q1004895" url="?curid=876849" title="Rocket Festival">
<text>The Rocket Festival (, ) is a merit-making ceremony traditionally practiced by ethnic Lao people at the beginning of the wet season in various villages and municipalities in Northeastern Thailand and Laos. The festivities typically include music and dance performances, competitive processions of floats, dancers, and musicians on the second day, and the competitive firing of homemade rockets on the third day. Local participants and sponsors take advantage of the occasion to enhance their social prestige, as is customary at traditional Buddhist folk festivals throughout Southeast Asia.

Bun Bang Fai is celebrated in all provinces across Laos, but the most popular one used to be held along the bank of the Mekong river in the capital, Vientiane. However, because of considerable urbanization and safety measures, the festivals are now celebrated in nearby villages, including Naxon, Natham, Thongmang, Ban Kern, and Pakkagnoung.

The festival in Thailand also includes special programs and specific local patterns like Bang Fai (parade dance) and a Beautiful Bang Fai float such as Yasothon on the third weekend of May, and continues to Suwannaphum District, Roi Et, on the first weekend of June, and Phanom Phrai District during the full moon of the seventh month in the Lunar year&#x27;s calendar each year. The Bang Fai festival is not only found in Isan, Northeasthern Thailand, North Thailand, and Laos, but also in Amphoe Sukhirin, Narathiwat.

==History==

These Buddhist festivals are presumed to have evolved from pre-Buddhist fertility rites held to celebrate and encourage the coming of the rains, from before the 9th century invention of black powder. This festival displays some earthy elements of Lao folklore. Bun Bang Fai originates from ancient times when ethnic Lao people believed in many gods and is mentioned in tales, such as &#x27;The Tale of Pha Daeng–Nang Ai&#x27; () and &#x27;The Tale of Phaya Khankhak&#x27; (). In the literature of Laos, such stories refer to the firing of rockets to the heavens to communicate with the God of Rain () and persuade him to send the rains to the earth in a timely fashion for cultivation.

Early European explorers who passed through Laos in the 1800s recorded witnessing the rocket festivals in the country. Louis de Carné, in 1866, described a celebration in southern Laos where bamboos loaded with powder went off, producing violent explosions. Furthermore, Etienne Aymonier, visiting Laos in 1883, described Bang Phoai (Bang Fai) as strong tubes of bamboo fretted with cords, or rattans, in which powder was stuffed.

The powder was manufactured in the country by mixing ten parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) with three pieces of wood charcoal and a part and a half of sulphur. These rockets were then deposited on trestles at the pagoda. The rockets were paraded around the temple before they were launched the next day. The celebration occurred in May or June.

Anthropology Professor Charles F. Keyes advises, &quot;In recognition of the deep-seated meaning of certain traditions for the peoples of the societies of mainland Southeast Asia, the rulers of these societies have incorporated some indigenous symbols into the national cultures that they have worked to construct in the postcolonial period&quot;. Giving the &quot;Bun Bang Fai or fire rocket festival of Laos&quot;, as one example, he adds that it remains &quot;far more elaborate in the villages than in the cities&quot;.

==In Laos==

Bun Bang Fai is held over the sixth Lunar month, usually around May and June, coinciding with the plantation and the beginning of the rainy seasons. Several months before the festival, an organizing committee is formed in each future host village to discuss the festival. Weeks before the festival, bamboo rockets are built and decorated by monks and villagers.
The festival usually lasts two days and begins early in the morning with the associated religious rituals performed by the monks in the temple. Early in the afternoon, a Buddhist procession starts in which villagers carrying money trees circle the central ordination hall, in which there is a Buddha statue, three times in a clockwise rotation on the sound of traditional music (). The money trees are then offered to the monks in a Buddhist ritual believed to garner religious merit. Afterwards, rockets from all involved villages are displayed in the court of the temple, followed by a celebration with traditional music and dance that can last up to the early morning of the next day.

The second day begins with a morning ceremony of food offerings from villagers to the monks in the assembly hall of the temple (). The food usually includes sticky rice, cakes, and other sweets that the faithful line up to place in the monks’ almsbowls during the sermon. In addition, other food dishes are portioned out in small bowls and offered to the monks on rattan trays. The religious leader of the village ritually presents the food to the monks by reciting the five precepts of Buddhism. The monks, in return, offer the teachings of the Buddha by chanting sutras and sermons. During the sermon, the faithful address prayers to their ancestors and do the Yaat Nam, which consists of having water blessed by a monk before pouring it, drop by drop, on the earth. After the ceremony, a meal is shared by all participants. The faithful believe these offerings grant a long life to anyone who gives with a serene heart.

The religious ceremony is followed by a street parade through the village with pickup trucks displaying the rockets on the sound of the Khene (), cymbals, and long drums. Teams of contestants dance and chant traditional folksong, with the team&#x27;s leader chanting first and then the others repeating (). Contestants are divided into groups based on the size of their rocket. The competition begins with the firing of the rockets skyward. For each rocket category, scores are given based on how high and far the rocket flies. Builders of failed rockets are thrown in a muddy pond and forced to drink Lao-Lao ().

== In the United States and France ==
Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, tens of thousands of Lao people left the country as refugees who resettled in other countries, most of them in the United States and in France. The Lao built Lao Buddhist temples () to serve as cultural centers. Traditional Lao holidays such as Lao New Year and Bun Bang Fai are celebrated in addition to the official host countries’ holidays. In France, Bun Bang Fai is celebrated in Paris and other cities; there is a community of Laotians in France. Bun Bang Fai has been celebrated in Bretignolles. In the United States, there are more than forty Wat Lao.

The celebration in both the United States and France lasts two days and proceeds as in Laos, beginning with a religious ceremony followed by a display and parade of rockets in the Wat with traditional Laoof Soeng Bang Faince on the Soeng Bang Fai music. Unlike in Laos, however, the procession does not conclude with the firing of the rockets, as they are not allowed to be launched because of safety measures. Instead, only small, handcrafted rockets are launched.

===In the National Air and Space Museum===
Frank H. Winter, curator of the Rocketry Division of the National Air and Space Museum, stated that: &quot;Lao Rocket is special and unique that has a thousand years of traditional celebration associated with this great looking rocket. It would be wonderful to have a Lao Rocket on display in the National Air and Space Museum so that the public can learn from it.&quot;

In 2005, Lao Bang Fai was chosen to be displayed at the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. The deputy abbot of Wat Lao Buddhavong in Virginia acknowledged that &quot;this event is historic and brings recognition and visibility that all Laotians can be proud of&quot;. Bun Bang Fai was launched in 1994 by the Lao community and has been celebrated each year since. The religious ceremonies are performed inside the museum on the campus of the University of Washington.

==In Northeastern Thailand==
Villages may have floats conveying government messages. They may also include fairs. In recent years, the Tourism Authority of Thailand has promoted the events, particularly in the Thai provinces of Nong Khai and Yasothon. The Bun bang Fai celebration in the past were in Yasothorn, Roi Et, Kalasin, Srisaket, Mahasarakham, and Udon Thani.

===Yasothon&#x27;s festival===
Since March 1, 1972, the separation of Yasothon from Ubon Ratchathani, Yasothon has staged its Rocket Festival in Thailand annually over Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in the middle of May.

The principal theme of any &quot;Hae Bangfai&quot; is the Phadaeng and Nang Ai legends. Many floats depict the couple and their retinue. &quot;Hàe&quot; typically end in a wat, where dancers and accompanying musicians may further compete in traditional folk dance. All groups prominently display the names of their major sponsors. Recalling the fertility rite origins of the festival, parade ornaments and floats often have phallic imagery. The festivities also include cross-dressing, both cross-sex and cross-generational, and alcohol. Perhaps the most popular beverage is a neutral grain spirit called Sura (), but more generally known as &quot;Lao Whiskey&quot; (, &quot;Lao lao&quot;) in Laos and &quot;Lao Khao&quot; (, &quot;white alcohol&quot;) in Thailand. Sato () may also be on offer.

On May 9, 1999, a &quot;Lan&quot; 120 kg rocket exploded 50 meters above ground, just two seconds after launch, killing four people and wounding 11.
==Bang Fai (the rockets)==
Bang Fai skyrockets are black-powder bottle rockets. Tiny bottle rockets are so-called because they may be launched from a bottle. In the case of the similar appearing Bang Fai, also spelled &quot;Bong Fai&quot;, the &#x27;bottle&#x27; is a &quot;bong&quot;, and a section of bamboo culm is used as a container (and only colloquially as a pipe for smoking marijuana).

Related to the Chinese Fire Arrow, Bang Fai are made from bamboo bongs. Most contemporary ones, however, are enclosed in PVC piping, making them less dangerous by standardizing their sizes and black-powder charges. Baking or boiling a bong kills insect eggs that otherwise hatch in dead bamboo and eat it. Vines tie long bamboo tails to launching racks. The time it takes for the exhaust to burn through the vines (usually) allows a motor to build up to full thrust; then the tails impart in-flight stability. Ignition comes from a burning fuse or electric match.

Bang Fai come in various sizes, competing in several categories. Small ones are called &quot;Bang Fai Noi&quot; (). Larger categories are designated by the counting words for 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000: &quot;Meun&quot; (), &quot;Saen&quot; (), and the largest Bang Fai, the &quot;Lan&quot; (). &quot;Bang Fai Lan&quot; are nine metres long and charged with 120 kg of black powder. These may reach altitudes reckoned in kilometres, and travel dozens of kilometres downrange. Competing rockets are scored for the apparent height, distance, and beauty of the vapour trail. A few include skyrocket pyrotechnics. A few also include parachutes for tail assemblies.
==Folktales==
===Nang Ai, Phadaeng, and Phangkhi===


Nang Ai (), or in full, &quot;Nang Ai Kham&quot; (), is the queen of pageants, and the Phadaeng is her champion. She is known as the most beautiful girl. He, an outsider, wants her, but he must win a rocket festival tournament to win her. He becomes part of a love triangle. Phangkhi and Nang Ai have been fated by their karma (, ) to have been reborn throughout many past existences as soulmates. Stories about the couple, however, say that in many past existences, she has been a dutiful wife and that he only wanted to satisfy himself. She becomes fed up and prays never to be paired with him again. Nang Ai is reborn as the daughter of Phraya Khom (, which means Lord Khmer; but even if her father was a Cambodian overlord, Nang Ai Kham is still the genuine article), while Phangki is reborn as the son of Phaya Nak, the Grand Nāga who rules the Deeps. Phangki is not invited to the tournament, and Phadaeng&#x27;s rocket fizzles. Nang Ai&#x27;s uncle is the winner, so her father calls the whole thing off, which is considered to be a very bad omen. Pangkhii shapeshifts into a white squirrel to spy on Nang Ai; she has him killed by a royal hunter.

Pangkhii&#x27;s flesh transforms into meat equal to 8,000 cartloads. Nang Ai and many of her countrymen ate this flesh, and Phaya Nak vows to allow no one to remain living who had eaten of the flesh of his son. Aroused from the Deeps, he and his watery myrmidons rise and turn the land into a vast swamp. Nagas personify waters running both above and below ground, and nagas run amok are rivers in spate; all of Isan is flooded. Phadaeng flees the flood with Nang Ai on his white stallion, Bak Sam, but she is swept off by Naga&#x27;s tail, not to be seen again. Bak Sam is seen in parades sporting his stallion&#x27;s equipage; legend says that he dug a lick called &quot;Lam Huay Sam&quot;. Phadaeng escapes. His ghost then raises an army of the spirits of the air to wage war on the Nagas. The war continues until both sides are exhausted, and the dispute is submitted to King Wetsawan, king of the North, for arbitration. His decision: the cause of the feud has long since been forgotten, and all disputants must let bygones be bygone.

The legend is retold in many regional variations. One 3000-word poem translated to English &quot;is especially well known to the Thai audience, having been designated as secondary school supplementary reading by the Thai Ministry of Education, with publication in 1978. There is even a Thai popular song about the leading characters.&quot; The original was written in a Lao-Isan verse called &quot;Khong saan&quot;; it has sexual innuendo, puns, and double entendre.

Keyes on page 48 wrote that &quot;Phra Daeng Nang Ai&quot; is a version of Kaundinya, the legendary founder of Funan, and Soma, the daughter of the king of the Nāga. Keyes also wrote that such legends may prove a valuable source of toponyms.

===Toad King===
Some said that Bang Fai is launched to bring rain, as in the Tourism Authority of Thailand link. However, a reading of the underlying myth, as presented in Yasothon and Nong Khai, implies the opposite: the rains bring on the rockets. Their version of the myth:

When the Lord Buddha was in his Bodhisattva (Pali) incarnation as King of the Toads Phaya Khang Khok, and married to Udon Khuruthawip (Northern Partner-Knowing-Continent), his sermons drew everyone away from Phaya Thaen (), King of the Sky). Phaya Thaen then withheld life-giving rains from the earth for seven years, seven months, and seven days. Acting against the advice of the Toad King, Phaya Naga, King of the Nāga (and personification of the Mekong), declared war on Phaya Thaen and lost.

Persuaded by Phaya Naga to assume command, King Toad enlisted the aid of termites to build mounds reaching to the heavens, and of venomous scorpions and centipedes to attack Phaya Thaen&#x27;s feet, and of hornets for air support. Previous attempts at aerial warfare against Phaya Thaen in his own element had proved futile; but even the Sky must come down to the ground. On the ground, the war was won, and Phaya Thaen sued for peace. Naga Rockets fired in the air at the end of the dry season are not to threaten Phaya Thaen, but to serve as a reminder to him of his treaty obligations made to Lord Bodhisatta Phaya Khang Khok on the ground. Phaya Nak was given the duty of Honor Guard at most Thai and Lao temples.

After the harvest of the resulting crops, Wow thanoo, man-sized kites with a strung bow, are staked out in winter monsoon winds. They are also called &quot;Túi-tiù&quot; from the sound of the bowstring singing in the wind, which sings all through the night, to signal Phaya Thaen that he has sent enough rain. All participants (including a wow thanoo) were depicted on murals on the front of the former Yasothon Municipal Bang Fai Museum, but were removed when it was remodeled as a learning center.

An English-language translation of a Thai report on &quot;Bang Fai Phaya Nark Naga fireballs&quot; at Nong Khai gives essentially the same myth (without the hornets and wow) from Thai folk.

==Etymology==
* Bun (, ) merit is from Pali Puñña merit, meritorio (पुण्य), ion, virtue, and Sanskrit पुण्य, puṇya, meritorious, good, or virtuous works.
* Bang (, (alternative spelling: บ้อง, &quot;bong&quot;)) is a cutting, specifically of bamboo.
* Fai (, ) is Fire.
* Prapheni () is from Sanskrit परंपर, &quot;parampara&quot;, meaning an uninterrupted series, regular series, succession &#x27;to be&#x27;handed down in regular succession&#x27;; from Pali paraṁparā 7795 paraṁparā series, tradition.

==In popular culture==
The 2006 Thai martial arts film, &quot;Kon Fai Bin&quot;, depicts the Rocket Festival. Set in 1890s Siam, the movie&#x27;s hero, Jone Bang Fai (&quot;Fireball Bandit&quot;), is an expert at building the traditional bamboo rockets, which he uses in conjunction with Muay Thai martial arts to defeat his opponents.

Thai political protests in April 2010 similarly had Red Shirts firing in downtown Bangkok.

In 2013, Vangvieng&#x27;s Bun Bang Fai was featured in the 2013 film, &quot;The Rocket&quot;. In the film, a young boy named Ahlo wanted to enter the rocket-making contest, hoping to win a big cash prize and prove that he was not cursed.

<doc id="876867" wikidata="Q7646298" url="?curid=876867" title="Surin Elephant Round-up">
<text>The Surin Elephant Round-up is a cultural festival held every year in Surin Province, Isan, Thailand. Usually the event is organized during the third week of November on the weekend. The festival has its origins in the royal hunts which were conducted in Surin Province during medieval times. The indigenous residents of Surin, the Kuy, have been traditional practitioners of corralling elephants and training them as working animals. When the Ayutthaya Kingdom came into power these hunts were converted into a public extravaganza and wild elephants were replaced with tame ones. The festival, in its contemporary form, was first organized in the 1960s when civil war in Cambodia and the steady decline in economic value of elephants forced the elephant handlers (mahouts) to seek occupations in the entertainment and tourism industry.

The modern two-day event includes a variety of shows displaying the physical prowess and skill of the animals, such as soccer games and tugs of war with the Royal Thai Army. Elephants painting pictures, playing polo, and whirling hula hoops on their trunks are also incorporated into the show. Numerous floats are put on display. The venue for the event, Si Narong Stadium, has been dubbed the &quot;world&#x27;s largest domestic elephant village&quot; by the Tourism Authority of Thailand.

==Ancient tradition==
Since ancient times wild elephants, believed to number in the thousands, roamed freely in the forests around Thailand. In Surin these elephants were rounded up, corralled and captured in hunts which were highly ritualistic and involved many mythological aspects. These hunts also served an economic purpose, as the captured elephants were tamed and used as pack animals or sometimes as war animals. These ritual hunts were noted by historians as ancient as Strabo, Arrian, and Megasthenes. The hunters, who mainly came from the tribe of Kuy people, performed several rituals before, during and after performing the actual hunt. These included divination from bones, wearing special clothes believed to possess protective powers, praying to the lassos for the strength to restrain the elephants and praying to ancestors. They also prayed to terrestrial and woodland spirits to grant success to the hunt.

==Emergence as a spectacle==

===14th to 18th century===
While the Ayutthaya Kings were in power, the elephant hunts were converted into a public spectacle and lost much of their ritualistic element. The round-ups became a royally sponsored event where local dignitaries and overseas guests were invited to savour the spectacle. Among these notable foreign dignitaries, who attended the event through royal invitation was François-Timoléon de Choisy. He wrote in his diary that the king had arranged a special round-up for his foreign guests even though the real event date had not arrived.

===Late-19th century to 1960s===
As the post-war era neared its end, the elephant round-up became progressively more staged and less of a real hunt. It became common to use tame or even trained elephants during the event. The round-ups were enacted primarily for the entertainment of royal guests. For example, King Chulalongkorn, also called Rama V, had a round-up specially staged for the Russian Prince Nicholas II in 1891 during the latter&#x27;s world tour as a crown prince. Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore visited Thailand and its provinces during 1903 and was bestowed with a royal invitation to see the round-up as an envoy of the NGS. She wrote about her experience, titling the story &quot;The Greatest Hunt in the World&quot;. In her printed story she related that the monarch of Siam and his entourage came to stay at the summer palace for the roundup which they sponsored. Dignitaries came by cruiser or rail, and locals mostly arrived by boat. She said that hunters worked for many hours and used various tactics to herd elephants numbering in their hundreds towards the &quot;kraal&quot;. The krall was an enclosure, the broadness of whose walls was about two meters and it had an inner enclosure made out of thick teak logs which measured up three and half meters in height. Iron bands buttressed the wooden walls. According to her account, more than 250 elephants were rounded up that year. Some were unintentionally hurt as they stomped and trumpeted during the round-up, but these received immediate care.

Over time, the round-ups grew progressively staged. The elephants utilized in the round-ups were often tame, who had to play the role of wild animals. This move from actual to artifice preceded the influx of tourism and therefore tourists never witnessed a real hunt. By 1938, the round-up had transitioned so far into a staged event that ladies in the audience were asked to choose which elephant ought to be captured next. The round-ups were abandoned in 1938, although a special &quot;last&quot; round-up was officially sponsored by the monarchy in 1962. It was staged in honour of King Frederik IX of Denmark and his wife Ingrid, who visited Thailand in early-1962.

==Re-emergence as a contemporary cultural festival==
Less than 34 years after the event lost royal patronage, it re-emerged as a prominent social festival with less ritual and more flair. According to some sources the first such round-up was organized and celebrated in 1955, while according to others the first event was celebrated in the 1960s. Either way, the first modern event was held on a modest scale in the Tha Tum subdistrict of Surin Province.

The festival was then moved to Surin proper. Nowadays, elephants and their trainers travel 100 km to Surin to participate in the festival. The ritualistic elements and traits of the festival have all but disappeared and the festival has become a pure tourist festival.

==Events held during the modern festival==
===Preparation===
The Kuy hunters who are singled out to perform in the round-up perform a morning ritual called the &quot;Pak Kum Luang&quot; almost an entire week before the festival. This ritual includes praying at the Pakam shrine, which is sacred to the lasso, as their elders had done in ancient times and then offering pigs heads, chickens, wine, jos sticks and herbs. When the required sign is obtained, the elders blow the hunters horn which signals that the 60 km long trek to the festival can commence. The journey is usually undertaken using trucks. The elephants and their mahouts arrive with at least five days to spare and spend this time roaming the streets while offering rides and practicing for their performance. The wives of the mahouts travel alongside them.

===Festival===

On Friday morning, a marching procession of approximately 300 elephants starts moving through Surin city from the railway station toward the elephant roundabout on Prasat Road in the southernmost neighborhood of the city.

The elephants carry dignitaries who dismount their steeds on arrival. Some elephants carry mahouts in authentic replicas of battle outfits from the Thai–Khmer–Laos battles. Intermingled with the elephant procession are students of local schools and their teachers in traditional dress, who are dancing and playing music.

Once all the elephants have arrived, the banquet begins. The tables for the banquet measure 400 meters in length and are customarily decorated with traditional silk cloth.

The food is presented before the elephants; leftovers are taken home by the local people. On 14 November 2003, the buffet set a Guinness World Record for &quot;largest elephant buffet&quot; when 269 Asian elephants came together to devour over of fruit and vegetables.

On Saturday, the entire company of elephants and their mahouts congregate at the Elephant Stadium just after daybreak. The ceremony at the stadium begins with a speech from the chairperson of the ceremony, after which baby elephants are paraded through the stadium. Then the processional march of bull elephants takes place. Next, the Kuy hunters pray to the lasso and showcase their skills at capturing elephants. They display how elephants were captured by hunters working alone, and how sometimes elephant riders were used to capture other elephants. Tame elephants which could be utilized to corral wild ones have been bred by the Kuy people since ancient times and are called Khonkies or Koomkies.

After the elephant capture technique displays, there are displays of acrobatics, matches of soccer and polo, and displays of tasks performed by tamed elephants, such as logging. Another event which displays the raw strength of Surin&#x27;s elephants is the elephant vs. army tug of war contest. The contest starts with 50 army personnel against the biggest bull elephant. As the bull beats the soldiers, 15 more are added until there are 100 soldiers matched against a single bull, and even then the bull usually wins.

The finale of the show is re-enactment of a historical battle between Siamese and Burmese forces. The forces are dressed in traditional colours with red for Siam and blue for Burma. They take up positions according to traditional battle tactics, with a front row of foot soldiers, central portion of elephants protecting the &quot;king&quot; elephant in the middle and a rear guard. The battle ends with Siamese victory.

Along with the elephant show the stadium hosts a mini-half marathon called &quot;Mueang Chang&quot;. The Red Cross Society also holds a cultural performance with the elephant show. The elephant show is repeated on Sunday morning.

<text>George Albert Boulenger (19 October 1858 – 23 November 1937) was a Belgian-British zoologist who described and gave scientific names to over 2,000 new animal species, chiefly fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Boulenger was also an active botanist during the last 30 years of his life, especially in the study of roses.

==Life==
Boulenger was born in Brussels, Belgium, the only son of Gustave Boulenger, a Belgian public notary, and Juliette Piérart, from Valenciennes. He graduated in 1876 from the Free University of Brussels with a degree in natural sciences, and worked for a while at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Brussels, as an assistant naturalist studying amphibians, reptiles, and fishes. He also made frequent visits during this time to the &quot;Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle&quot; in Paris and the British Museum in London.

Boulenger developed a lifelong passion for animals, which led him to study zoology at the University. During his university years, he gained recognition at the Musee d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, Brussels and was hired as an assistant naturalist in 1880. Two years later, he joined the British Museum&#x27;s Department of Zoology as a first-class assistant, under the leadership of Dr. Gunther. Boulenger held this position until his retirement in 1920.

After his retirement from the British Museum, Boulenger studied roses and published 34 papers on botanical subjects and two volumes on the roses of Europe. He died in Saint Malo, France.

According to biographical accounts, he was incredibly methodical and had an amazing memory that enabled him to remember every specimen and scientific name he ever saw. He also had extraordinary powers of writing, seldom made a second draft of anything he wrote, and his manuscripts showed but few corrections before going to the publisher.

Boulenger also played the violin, could speak French, German, and English apart from reading Spanish, Italian and a bit of Russian. As a zoologist, he also had a working knowledge of both Greek and Latin.

By 1921, Boulenger had published 875 papers totaling more than 5,000 pages, as well as 19 monographs on fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. The list of his publications and its index of species covers 77 printed pages.

He described 1,096 species of fish, 556 species of amphibians, and 872 species of reptiles. He was famous for his monographs on amphibians, lizards and other reptiles, and fishes, for example, his monographs on the fishes of Africa.

He was a member of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists and was elected its first honorary member in 1935. In 1937, Belgium conferred on him the Order of Leopold, the highest honor awarded to a civilian.

His son, Edward George Boulenger (1888–1946), was also a zoologist and held the post of Director of the London Zoo Aquarium.

==Work on cave-dwelling fish==
In 1897, King Leopold II of Belgium started to recruit naturalists to help create the Congo museum. Boulenger was named chairman for this commission.

His main discovery in 1921 was a strange fish from the Congo. It was eyeless and lacked pigmentation. He recognized it as new and unrelated to any extant epigean (eyed, surface) species of Africa. He wrote a brief paper describing this new species of cave fish, the first ever described from Africa. He called it &quot;Caecobarbus geertsii&quot;, from &quot;caeco&quot; = blind, &quot;barbus&quot; = barb, and &quot;geertsii&quot;, honoring a mysterious person, M. Geerts, who provided him with the specimen. Today, it is known as the Congo blind barb or African blind barb.

==Honours==

*&quot;Hyphessobrycon boulengeri&quot; 
*&quot;Labeobarbus boulengeri&quot; 
*&quot;Lepidiolamprologus boulengeri&quot; 
*&quot;Xenophysogobio boulengeri&quot; was named for Boulenger, who provided &quot;some guidance&quot; (translation) in the completion of Tchang&#x27;s paper.

In the above lists, a binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than the genus to which it is currently assigned.

;Fish genera named after Boulenger

<doc id="876872" wikidata="Q204725" url="?curid=876872" title="Addams Family Values">
<text>Addams Family Values is a 1993 American supernatural black comedy film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and written by Paul Rudnick, based on the characters created by Charles Addams. It is the sequel to &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991). The film features almost all the main cast members from the original film, including Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd, Christina Ricci, Carel Struycken, Jimmy Workman, and Christopher Hart. Joan Cusack and Carol Kane joined the cast for this film.

Compared to its predecessor, which retained something of the madcap approach of the 1960s sitcom, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; is played more for very dark and macabre laughs. The film revolves around the family&#x27;s adjustments to the birth of new baby Pubert. Subplots include Uncle Fester marrying the new nanny Debbie Jellinsky, who is a serial killer intending to murder him for his inheritance; and teenagers Wednesday and Pugsley Addams being sent to summer camp.

The film was released by Paramount Pictures on November 19, 1993. In contrast to its predecessor&#x27;s mixed reception, the film was well received by critics; however, it was not as financially successful, with a box office gross of $111 million against a budget of $47 million. In the decades since its release, the film has become acclaimed for its humor and performances. This would be Julia&#x27;s final theatrical film released during his lifetime; he would appear posthumously in one more film, &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1994). The film was followed by another sequel, &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot;.

==Plot==
Gomez and Morticia Addams have a baby, hiring the nanny Debbie Jellinsky to care for their newborn son Pubert. This is after a number of failed attempts by his siblings Wednesday and Pugsley to kill him, for which Gomez and Morticia gently rebuke them.

Unbeknownst to them, Debbie is a serial killer who marries and then murders rich bachelors to collect their inheritances. After she seduces Uncle Fester, Wednesday becomes suspicious of her intentions. To maintain her cover, Debbie tricks Gomez and Morticia into believing Wednesday and Pugsley want to go to summer camp.

Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to Camp Chippewa, managed by the bubbly counselors Gary and Becky Granger. There, they are singled out by the campers, including popular and snobbish girl Amanda Buckman, for their macabre appearance and behavior. Joel Glicker, a nerdy bookworm and fellow outcast, becomes attracted to Wednesday. Debbie and Fester become engaged.

At her bachelorette party, Debbie is repulsed by the Addams family and their relatives. At their wedding, Fester passionately and with great emotion declares his everlasting devotion, while Debbie offers a lackluster response. On their honeymoon, she tries unsuccessfully to kill Fester by throwing a boombox into the bathtub.

Frustrated, Debbie forces him to cut ties with his family; when they try to visit Fester and Debbie at their home, they are turned away. The Addamses are alarmed to find that Pubert has transformed into a blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked and blond-haired baby. Grandmama attributes this to his disrupted family life, and Gomez becomes horribly depressed.

Back at Camp Chippewa, the counselors cast Wednesday as Pocahontas in Gary&#x27;s Thanksgiving play, &quot;A Turkey Named Brotherhood&quot;. When she refuses to participate, she, Pugsley, and Joel are all sent to the camp&#x27;s &quot;Harmony Hut&quot; and forced to watch hours of wholesome family entertainment movies and television shows.

Afterwards, the three feign cheerfulness, and Wednesday agrees to take part. However, during the performance, she returns to being her true self. With help from Joel, Pugsley, and the other outcasts, they capture Amanda, Gary, and Becky by igniting the pilgrim set. Later, Wednesday and Joel share their first kiss before she leaves, with Joel staying behind to lead their friends to ensure the camp&#x27;s permanent destruction. Pugsley and Wednesday return home in the campsite&#x27;s stolen van.

Debbie tries to kill Fester by blowing up their mansion, but he survives. She then pulls a gun and reveals that she never loved him and was only after his money. Thing helps Fester.

Fester later apologizes to Gomez at the Addams mansion, Wednesday and Pugsley return, successfully reuniting the family at last. Just then, Debbie arrives, holds them at gunpoint, and straps them into electric chairs to kill them all.

The Addams family listens to her sympathetically, as she explains that as a child and young (self-proclaimed) ballerina, she killed her parents Sharon and Dave after they gave her a Malibu Barbie doll on her 10th birthday rather than her desired ballerina Barbie. Then, as an adult, murdered her first two husbands for incredibly frivolous and materialistic reasons.

Meanwhile Pubert, now restored to his normally pale and mustachioed self, escapes from his crib with a knife and reaches the family via a series of improbable events. As Debbie lowers the switch to electrocute the Addamses, Pubert connects two loose wires, rerouting the electrical current through her instead, destroying her in spectacular fashion. All that remains are a pile of ashes, her shoes, and her credit cards—the means of the family&#x27;s salvation.

Some time later, the Addamses and their relatives gather to celebrate Pubert&#x27;s first birthday, with Joel also attending. Fester laments Debbie&#x27;s loss, but soon becomes smitten with Dementia, a new nanny Cousin Itt and his wife Margaret Alford have hired for their child.

Out in the family graveyard, Joel attempts to ask Wednesday out by asking about having a future with a husband, though she turns him down. She then tells him Debbie was a sloppy husband killer, and that Wednesday would have scared her husband to death and made sure not to be caught. As he lays flowers on Debbie&#x27;s grave, a hand emerges from the earth and grabs him, prompting Wednesday to smile as he screams.

==Production==
The &quot;family values&quot; in the film&#x27;s title is a tongue-in-cheek reference by writer Paul Rudnick to a 1992 speech (&quot;Reflections on Urban America&quot;) made by then-vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle. In the speech, Quayle controversially blamed the 1992 Los Angeles riots on a breakdown of &quot;family values&quot;.

Production of &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; began in Los Angeles on February 8, 1993. According to Anjelica Huston, it became increasingly clear during filming that Raul Julia&#x27;s health was deteriorating. He had trouble eating and was losing weight as a result. He died on October 24, 1994, less than a year after the film was released. Sequoia National Park, particularly Sequoia Lake, in the Sierra Nevada of California, was the site of the movie&#x27;s &quot;Camp Chippewa&quot;.

==Music==

=== Michael Jackson&#x27;s involvement ===
American singer Michael Jackson was supposed to feature a song in the film, called &quot;Family Thing&quot;. The song is mostly rumored to have been removed due to the child sexual abuse allegations against Jackson; in reality, it was because of contractual differences with Paramount Pictures. The song has since been leaked online. Jackson is referenced in the film via a poster in the Harmony Hut advertising his 1992 single &quot;Heal the World&quot;, which horrifies Joel.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Addams Family Values&quot; opened at number 1 at the US box office in its opening weekend with a reported gross of $14,117,545. In its second week, the film dropped to number 2 behind &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, and in its third week to number 3 behind &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; and &quot;A Perfect World&quot;. Its final box office gross in the United States and Canada was $48,919,043, a significant decline from the previous film&#x27;s domestic total of $113,502,426. Internationally it grossed $62 million, for a worldwide total of $110.9 million.

===Critical response===

&quot;Addams Family Values&quot; was well received, garnering significantly better reviews than the first film. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 75% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;New, well-developed characters add dimension to this batty satire, creating a comedy much more substantial than the original&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, a grade up from the &quot;B&quot; earned by the previous film.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wondered if &quot;the making of this sequel was sheer drudgery for all concerned&quot;, then answered herself by writing: &quot;There&#x27;s simply too much glee on the screen, thanks to a cast and visual conception that were perfect in the first place and a screenplay by Paul Rudnick that specializes in delightfully arch, subversive humor&quot;. Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; was slightly less enthusiastic than Maslin: &quot;It remains perilously slim in the story department, but glides over the thin ice with technical razzle-dazzle and an exceptionally winning cast&quot;. Richard Schickel, writing for &quot;Time&quot;, was even less enthusiastic than Klady, calling the film &quot;an essentially lazy movie, too often settling for easy gags and special effects that don&#x27;t come to any really funny point&quot;. Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert had disliked the first film. Siskel gave &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; a mixed review and accused Sonnenfeld of caring more about how the film looks than how the jokes play. Ebert, however, gave the film three stars out of four and thought that, unusually for a sequel, it improved upon its predecessor. He enjoyed the various subplots and recommended the film.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Art Direction (Ken Adam, Marvin March), but lost to &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;; and Huston was nominated for the 1993 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her performance as Morticia, a reprise of her Golden Globe-nominated performance in the 1991 original. The film also won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song for the Tag Team track &quot;Addams Family (Whoomp!)&quot;. &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; was nominated for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs. In 2016, James Charisma of &quot;Playboy&quot; ranked the film #15 on a list of &quot;15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals&quot;.

==Home media==

The &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; video game was produced by Ocean Software.

The film was released on VHS and DVD in 2000 with only two theatrical trailers as special features. It was re-released in 2006 with the first film on a single disc, with no new features.

In October 2019, the film debuted on the Blu-ray format when Paramount Pictures released double feature of &quot;Addams Family&quot; and &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; on Blu-ray in the United States, along with standalone releases. In Australia, the film was released on VHS by Paramount Home Entertainment (Australasia) in 1994. In 2002, the film was released on DVD with theatrical trailers in the extra features.

==Legacy==
In retrospect, Barry Sonnenfeld recalled: &quot;I was disappointed in the box office for the second film. I think the first film is more romantic and the second film is funnier. Part of the reason it didn&#x27;t do as well is that the marketing of the movie was so similar to the first one that people didn&#x27;t think it was going to be any value-added and I really wanted to push the Pubert of it all and the Fester of it all. Instead, the whole campaign was back with the original Addams Family, so it wasn&#x27;t really promising anything new. I think that&#x27;s in part why it didn&#x27;t do as well. Many people love it as much or more as the first one&quot;.

In the decades since its release, the film has been reassessed with retrospective acclaim. Once a source of mixed reception, the film&#x27;s dark humor and satire have become lauded. Ricci&#x27;s and Cusack&#x27;s performances have also received praise, with Cusack&#x27;s role in particular becoming the source of several memes and tribute videos on YouTube dedicated to her performance.

<doc id="876875" wikidata="Q286359" url="?curid=876875" title="Sarah Kerrigan">
<text>Sarah Louise Kerrigan, the self-styled Queen of Blades, is a character in Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;StarCraft&quot; franchise. She was created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, and her original appearance was designed by Metzen. Sarah Kerrigan is voiced by Glynnis Talken Campbell in &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;&quot;, Tricia Helfer in &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;, &quot;Heart of the Swarm&quot; and &quot;Legacy of the Void,&quot; and Vanessa Marshall in &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;.

Kerrigan first appears in &quot;StarCraft&quot; as a twenty-six-year-old Ghost, a psychic trained both physically and mentally as an expert espionage agent and assassin. Initially the second-in-command of Sons of Korhal, a revolutionary movement against the oppressive Confederacy of Man, she is captured by the insectoid Zerg and genetically mutated into a human/Zerg hybrid completely under the control of the Zerg Overmind. Initially one of the Zerg&#x27;s most powerful agents, she gains control of the Zerg after the destruction of the Overmind, and seeks dominance over the galaxy. Kerrigan&#x27;s life before her infestation is further explored in the &quot;StarCraft&quot; novels &quot;Uprising&quot; and &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, while &quot;Queen of Blades&quot; elaborates on her infested character.

As one of the major characters of the series, Kerrigan has been critically praised by video game journalists for her believability and character depth, and is frequently featured in lists of the top video game women, villains and characters in general. Her reception in regards to gender representation in video games has been more mixed. She has been considered to challenge some hetero-normative gender roles while adhering to others, and to also have an overly sexualized design.

==Character design==
The character of Kerrigan was created by Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with her physical appearance designed by Metzen. Kerrigan was not originally intended to be a major character, and was only meant to appear on a single level. Initially based around the character Tanya Adams in the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; series, Kerrigan was named after Nancy Kerrigan, who at the time was involved in a feud with Tonya Harding. However, Kerrigan&#x27;s character grew on the developers, who decided to give a far greater role to the throw-away character. Kerrigan&#x27;s self-proclaimed title is the &quot;Queen of Blades&quot;, which is gradually introduced to other characters to the point where it is synonymous with her. Chris Metzen has explained that it was meant to be an honorific title; a blade is a weapon designed to rip enemies to pieces, making the title fitting for Kerrigan, who evolved to be the greatest agent of the Zerg Overmind.

In an interview Glynnis Talken Campbell, Kerrigan&#x27;s voice actress from &quot;Starcraft&quot; and &quot;&quot;, described Kerrigan&#x27;s change in personality during her infestation as &quot;going from good girl to bad girl&quot;, and has said it was more of a change in personality than voice when providing her voice work. Kerrigan&#x27;s voice also consisted of many grunts, growls and screams, and her unique infested voice was provided by doubling up Campbell&#x27;s voice. She has also claimed that, were she to pen a &quot;StarCraft&quot; film or novel, she would rather have Kerrigan&#x27;s relationship with Jim Raynor—the series&#x27; primary male protagonist—portrayed as one of admiration, sacrifice, and &quot;them saving each other&#x27;s butts&quot; than actual romance due to &quot;StarCraft&quot;&#x27;s action-oriented nature. While Campbell expressed interest in returning to voice the character in &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, and even voiced Kerrigan in the trailer for the game, she confirmed in February 2009 that she would not be reprising the role. Campbell stated that her work in the trailer was considered an audition of sorts and that Blizzard had decided to go in a different direction. Tricia Helfer replaced her, voicing Kerrigan in &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot; as well as the expansions &quot;Heart of the Swarm&quot; and &quot;Legacy of the Void&quot;. The third actress to voice Kerrigan was Vanessa Marshall in the 2015 crossover video game &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;.

===Personality===
Having been conscripted into the Confederate Ghost program as a child due to her psychic potential, Kerrigan is described in the manual for &quot;StarCraft&quot; as never having been given the chance for a normal life. Her rigorous training and the use of neural implants to control her mental abilities leave her withdrawn and introverted. Despite this, Kerrigan exhibits qualities of courage and daring, and is an effective tactician. She is also described as a moral character, exemplified in her opposition to Arcturus Mengsk using the Zerg against the Confederacy. However, after her transformation by the Zerg, Kerrigan is freed from her inhibitions—as well as her neural conditioning—and indulges her darker traits (though &quot;Heart of the Swarm&quot; implies that at least part of her villainy was due to the influence of a fallen Xel&#x27;naga named Amon). Her attitude, combined with her natural intelligence, makes her extremely calculating and manipulative. A hint of her former moral sensitivity is to be noted when towards the end of the Zerg campaign of &quot;Brood War&quot;, she states how she feels weary of slaughter for the first time since her transformation. Kerrigan has also become far more physically aggressive, relishing close quarters combat so much that at one point in the novel &quot;Queen of Blades&quot;, she begins absent-mindedly licking the blood of her victims from her fingers.

One of the core elements of Kerrigan&#x27;s personality is that of her manipulation by others, and her lack of identity. Her reversion to human form by Raynor allowed her to finally develop an identity for herself, though found her emotions torn between a man that she loved (Raynor) and a man that she despised (Mengsk).

==Depiction==

Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is described as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel &quot;Queen of Blades&quot; describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device. When off-duty, she is described as wearing casual clothing and always being equipped with at least a combat knife.

Kerrigan&#x27;s infestation by the Zerg signaled a major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she is described in &quot;Queen of Blades&quot; as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan&#x27;s eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect&#x27;s legs. Kerrigan&#x27;s fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down to the level of her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.

Kerrigan ascended into Xel&#x27;naga form by consuming the essence of Ouros, the last remaining Xel&#x27;naga, marking a complete overhaul for her appearance. Her physique resembles that of her human form, though her skin turns a metallic gold color with flames along the surface, and she has a pair of angelic wings. Kerrigans final canon appearance is in the &quot;Legacy of the Void&quot; epilogue cutscene, where she is shown to have returned to her human form.

==Appearances==

===In &quot;StarCraft&quot;===
Sarah Kerrigan appears in &quot;StarCraft&quot; (1998) halfway through the first chapter of the game. She and Confederate officer Jim Raynor are tasked by Arcturus Mengsk, the leader of the militant rebel group Sons of Korhal, with starting a revolution on the fringe colony world of Antiga Prime by assassinating the presiding officers of the ruling Confederacy of Man. In response, the Confederacy blockades the planet as the insectoid Zerg Swarm begin to invade the surface, and Mengsk orders Kerrigan, against her wishes, to plant a psi emitter—stolen Confederate technology that attracts Zerg to it—to lure the Zerg into breaking the blockade, allowing the Sons of Korhal to escape. The Sons of Korhal then directly attack the Confederate capital world Tarsonis. During the attack, Mengsk, without consulting his officers, uses the psi emitters to ensure the complete destruction of the planet by the Zerg. The Zerg are subsequently attacked by the Protoss, a race of psionic aliens who attempt to stop further Zerg advancement and conquest. Kerrigan is sent with a detachment of troops to stop the Protoss from interfering with the Zerg rampage, but her position is overrun by the Zerg, and Mengsk refuses to rescue her as punishment for questioning his orders. Raynor deserts Mengsk in disgust, and Kerrigan is presumed dead.

However, as the second chapter begins, the player is charged by the Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a chrysalis on the planet Char. When the chrysalis hatches, it reveals Kerrigan has been infested with Zerg DNA, making her a powerful Zerg and Terran hybrid. In addition to her radically altered appearance, her personality has drastically shifted, putting her in allegiance with the Zerg. Raynor, drawn to Char by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails in an attempt to rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan, who is now aligned with the Zerg, does not see him as a threat. After breaking into a Terran science vessel, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan&#x27;s attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders. However, through a temporary mental connection, the Overmind is able to use Zeratul&#x27;s memories to locate the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm to invade the planet, although Kerrigan remains behind on Char to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.

===In &quot;StarCraft: Brood War&quot;===
Following the Overmind&#x27;s death at the hands of Tassadar in the conclusion of &quot;StarCraft&quot;, Kerrigan regains her independence from the Zerg hive mind and dedicates her efforts to becoming the leader of the Zerg Swarm. She presents herself on the Protoss colony world Shakuras, where she informs Zeratul and the Protoss of a new Overmind growing on Char, manipulating them into destroying Zerg forces running rival to her goals. She also gains an ally in Samir Duran, an apparently infested ex-Confederate Ghost who infiltrates the newly arrived forces of the United Earth Directorate (UED), and attempts to sabotage their mission to enslave the Zerg. The UED is successful in capturing the new Overmind, and Kerrigan exploits the threat of the UED to forge an alliance with Mengsk, Raynor and his new Protoss allies, turning around the war against the UED. However, Kerrigan quickly betrays this alliance and strikes at the armies of Raynor and Mengsk, heavily damaging both groups. Accompanied by Duran, Kerrigan returns to Shakuras to abduct the Protoss leader Raszagal, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the new Overmind on Char, after which all Zerg fall under Kerrigan&#x27;s control. Zeratul attempts to rescue Raszagal, but kills her when he realizes her mind has been destroyed by Kerrigan&#x27;s brainwashing. Kerrigan, surprised by his actions, allows him to live. Soon after, Kerrigan&#x27;s position on Char is attacked by a vengeful Protoss fleet, the remnants of the UED&#x27;s invasion force and a mercenary fleet commanded by Mengsk. Despite being outnumbered, Kerrigan&#x27;s forces prevail, crippling her enemies and eradicating the UED fleet, thereby securing a dominant position in the sector.

===In &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;===
Kerrigan returns in &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot; (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen explained that in the years after &quot;Brood War&quot;, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan&#x27;s withdrawal has little to do with any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of &quot;Brood War&quot; to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know much about him, but in the time after &quot;Brood War&quot;, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.

In &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, Kerrigan launches an attack on the Terran Dominion colonies, in pursuit of various pieces of a Xel&#x27;naga artifact. Coincidentally, Jim Raynor is also pursuing these artifacts under the employment of a secretive group called the Moebius Foundation. Raynor&#x27;s forces and Kerrigan battle throughout the pursuit. It is revealed that the Mobius Foundation is controlled by Valerian Mengsk, the son of Arcturus Mengsk, who opposes his father&#x27;s methods of ruling of the Dominion. Valerian explains to Raynor that the Xel&#x27;naga artifacts, when pieced together, have the power to return Kerrigan to her human form. At one point, Zeratul suddenly appears on board Raynor&#x27;s ship, allowing him to discover an ancient Xel&#x27;naga prophecy that Kerrigan must live as she will save the universe from a coming war against Protoss-Zerg hybrids. After learning this, Raynor mounts an invasion on Char in collaboration with Dominion forces under the control of Valerian, to eliminate the Zerg and rescue Kerrigan. The Xel&#x27;naga artifact releases an energy blast that kills the Zerg, and mostly returns Kerrigan to her human form. Raynor then carries the weakened Kerrigan over the ruined battlefield to safety.

===In &quot;StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm&quot;===
Kerrigan is the main character in &quot;StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm&quot;. After regaining her human form, Kerrigan is brought by Raynor to a secret research facility run by Valerian Mengsk to determine if she can still control the Zerg. However, the facility is attacked by Dominion forces and while Kerrigan and Valerian escape, Raynor is captured. Mengsk&#x27;s publicly announces he has executed Raynor, and while planning to enact revenge against him, Kerrigan is approached by Zeratul, who tells her to travel to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg. On Zerus, Kerrigan learns that a being called Amon stole a large portion of the Zerg from the planet and bound them to the Overmind, making them Amon&#x27;s slaves as part of his plot to destroy both the Zerg and Protoss and remake life in his own image. Kerrigan learns that the Overmind created her as an attempt to free to Zerg from Amon&#x27;s control. Kerrigan chooses to increase her power by entering a chrysalis, transforming again into a Zerg and Terran hybrid, though this time retaining her original personality. Mengsk contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor was not killed, but is being held as a hostage. He threatens to kill Raynor if she goes to war against the Dominion. With help from Valerian and Raynor&#x27;s forces, Kerrigan manages to rescue Raynor, but is rejected by him for choosing to return to her Zerg form. Now in full control of the Zerg, Kerrigan launches an attack on the Dominion&#x27;s main world, Korhal, to defeat Mengsk. Valerian convinces her to permit civilian evacuation. As a result, Raynor and his raiders reinforce her assault on the imperial palace. Confronting Mengsk, Kerrigan is almost killed by the Xel&#x27;naga artifact before Raynor disables it. Kerrigan kills Mengsk, and leaves Raynor to prepare the swarm for the fight against Amon.

===In &quot;StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void&quot;===
During the events of &quot;Legacy of the Void&quot;, Kerrigan enters into an alliance with Artanis while investigating the Xel&#x27;Naga &quot;homeworld&quot; Ulnar, which the pair discover is in fact a colossal space station. Some time after Artanis&#x27;s reclamation of the Protoss homeworld, Aiur, Kerrigan sends a psionic call to Raynor and Artanis: she proposes an alliance to permanently defeat Amon, since he will only arise again in a few thousand years if he is not dealt with. During the assault of the Void by the joint forces of the Terran Dominion, Zerg Swarm and Protoss, the full context of Zeratul&#x27;s prophecy about Kerrigan is made clear; only a fellow Xel&#x27;Naga is capable of killing Amon, and Kerrigan is the only one who can ascend to that status. The allied forces are successful in defeating Amon. As Kerrigan is charging her power to finally kill Amon, she warns Jim to leave the area for his safety. The game&#x27;s final cutscene is set two years later. Raynor is alone in a bar on the planet Mar Sara. Without further explanation, Kerrigan appears in the background, out of focus, in her human form and ghost armor. She asks Jim if he is ready to leave, and he gladly joins her; on screen text states they are never seen again.

===In &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;===
Kerrigan appears as a playable character in Blizzard&#x27;s non-canon crossover video game &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;.

===In novels===
Kerrigan appears in several &quot;StarCraft&quot; novels that greatly expand her backstory before the first &quot;StarCraft&quot; game. The novel &quot;Uprising&quot; portrays Kerrigan&#x27;s training as a Ghost assassin from an early age, where she is subjected to intense psychological abuse from her Confederate trainer, Lieutenant Rumm. When she was a young girl, an accident, most likely involving her powers, kills her mother and puts her father in a vegetative state. Consequently, Kerrigan is terrified to use her psionic abilities, and refuses Rumm&#x27;s demands to show her power, even when he threatens to kill her father. Kerrigan is eventually subdued with mental implants and used as a top Confederate assassin until she is rescued by Arcturus Mengsk. The novels &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Crusade&quot; and &quot;Queen of Blades&quot; provide novelisations for Kerrigan&#x27;s actions in Episodes I and II of &quot;StarCraft&quot; respectively. &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Crusade&quot; develops the implied relationship between Jim Raynor and Kerrigan, while &quot;Queen of Blades&quot; serves to demonstrate Kerrigan&#x27;s complete transformation by the Zerg, her removal of her inhibitions and morality, and its effect on her former love, Raynor.

In addition, Kerrigan briefly appears in Gabriel Mesta&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of the Xel&#x27;naga&quot;, set between &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Brood War&quot;, in which she attempts to secure a Xel&#x27;naga artifact on the independent colony world Bhekar Ro, but fails when it eradicates her forces. Kerrigan is also observed in &quot;Shadow Hunters&quot;, the second novel in &quot;The Dark Templar Saga&quot;, a trilogy that acts as a precursor to &quot;StarCraft II&quot;. After sensing a nexus of joined human minds caused by protagonist Jake Ramsey at the end of the first novel, Kerrigan sends Zerg forces to its location, infesting the half-dead body of a Dominion-funded black marketeer, Ethan Stewart. As the attack is the first Zerg activity for years, it inadvertently raises the suspicions of Arcturus Mengsk, who wonders what could have motivated it.

==Reception and legacy==
Kerrigan has consistently received positive reviews from video-game journalists. &quot;GameSpot&quot; attributed the popularity of &quot;StarCraft&quot; to the reception of the game&#x27;s characters, including Kerrigan. Her transition from Terran to Zerg was particularly praised, and they opined that the reason her face appeared on the box art for &quot;Brood War&quot; was due to how recognizable she had become. Following her appearance in &quot;Brood War&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; commented favorably on the evolution of Kerrigan&#x27;s character through &quot;StarCraft&#x27;s&quot; storyline, and also described her as one of the most memorable villains in gaming. In 2007, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Games&quot; opined she was one of the &quot;most fascinatingly complex and memorable characters of all time&quot;. Following her appearance in &quot;StarCraft II&quot; and its expansions, numerous video-game journalists described Kerrigan among the best villains in gaming, with many commenting on the complexity of her character. &quot;Game Informer&#x27;s&quot; Liz Lanier opined that Kerrigan was &quot;as brutal as she is misunderstood.&quot; Rich Antoniello from &quot;Complex&#x27;s&quot; described her life as a &quot;tragic tale of nearly Shakespearean proportions&quot;, and Hanuman Welch considered her the most evil woman in video gaming. Kerrigan&#x27;s voice acting has also received positive reception. Her portrayal in &quot;StarCraft&quot; by Glynnis Talken Campbell, was praised by &quot;GameSpot&quot;, while Tricia Helfer won &quot;Best Performance by a Human Female&quot; for her voicing of Kerrigan in &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot; at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards.

Kerrigan&#x27;s reception in relation to gender representation in video games, however, has been mixed. Writing in &quot;Nordlit&quot; and &quot;Games and Culture&quot; respectively, academics Sarah Stang and Gregory Blomquist cite Kerrigan as a rare example of a monstrous feminine character who is playable, empowered, and conventionally attractive, in contrast to feminine monsters such as The Mother in &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;, who is a &quot;physically grotesque&quot; antagonist for the player to kill. Stang, however, considers Kerrigan&#x27;s storyline to have patriarchal elements which undermine her empowerment; Kerrigan is infested against her will by the Overmind, who is voiced by male actors and who she refers to as her father, and Raynor&#x27;s work to remove her infestation, also against her will, is said to turn her from being a femme fatale to a damsel in distress for him to protect. Stang concludes that while Kerrigan is more complex and designed less misogynistically than other monstrous women in gaming, she cannot be considered an example of positive female empowerment. Similarly, Blomquist comments that Kerrigan &quot;teeter[s] on two binaries that both empower and disempower her&quot;. He criticized her over-sexualization, such as her exaggerated hip swing when walking and her feet resembling stiletto heels, which he argued is impractical for her frequent close combat fights and was only added to be visually appealing for male viewers. However, Blomquist also comments on Kerigan subverting hetero-normative gender roles, such as by penetrating Mengsk, the patriarchal Terran leader, with her skeletal wings before killing him, and also considers her sardonically referring to herself as &quot;Queen Bitch of the Universe&quot; as an empowering reclamation of the term &#x27;bitch&#x27;. Reviewing &quot;Heart of the Swarm&quot;, video-game journalist Alec Meer from &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; said that &quot;initially laudable attempts&quot; to make Kerrigan a strong female were undermined by the game only using men to talk her out of making violent decisions. He was particularly critical of the sexualization of both her human and infested forms, calling her appearance a &quot;disasterpiece of exploitation&quot;.

Kerrigan is featured in numerous &quot;StarCraft&quot; merchandise, including toys and miniature statues. Due to the complexity of Kerrigan&#x27;s infested appearance, she is cited as a particularly difficult character for cosplaying, though attempts have been praised. Dwight Schrute dresses as Kerrigan&#x27;s infested appearance for a Halloween party on a 2011 episode of &quot;The Office&quot;. The character is the subject of the song &quot;Queen of Blades&quot; by Swedish band Avatar on their 2009 album &quot;Avatar&quot;. In 2012, Dutch musician Maduk and Canadian singer Veela released the song &quot;Ghost Assassin&quot;, a dedicated anthem for Kerrigan&#x27;s arc throughout the &quot;StarCraft&quot; franchise.

<text>Amram bar Sheshna or Amram Gaon ( or ; died 875) was a gaon or head of the Academy of Sura in Lower Mesopotamia in the ninth century.

He authored many responsa, but his chief work was liturgical. He was the first to arrange a complete liturgy for the synagogue. His siddur (&quot;Siddur Rav Amram&quot; or &quot;Seder Rav Amram&quot;), which took the form of a long responsum to the Jews of al-Andalus, is still extant and was an important influence on most of the current rites in use among Rabbinic Jews.

==Biography==
Amram ben Sheshna was a pupil of Natronai ben Hilai, Gaon of Sura, and was exceptionally honored with the title of Gaon within the lifetime of his teacher. Eventually, he broke away from his teacher and started his own seat of learning.

Upon Natronai&#x27;s death, about 857, the full title and dignities of the &quot;geonate&quot; were conferred upon Amram, a title which he held for 18 years, until his death.

==Responsa==
He is the author of about 120 responsa, most of which were published in Salonica in 1792 in a collection entitled &quot;Sha&#x27;arei Tzedek&quot;, touching almost every aspect of Jewish jurisprudence. They afford insight into Amram&#x27;s personality as well as religious practice among Jews of that period. For example, the ruling that interest may not be exacted even from non-Jews, nor even such minor profits as the Talmud designates as &quot;the dust of interest&quot;, these being allowed only when customary in non-Jewish business circles. It is characteristic of Amram&#x27;s method to avoid extreme stringency; thus he decides that a slave who has embraced Judaism but desires to postpone circumcision until he feels strong enough for it, is not to be hurried. He combats superstition and places himself almost in opposition to the Talmud when he protests that there is no sense in fasting on account of bad dreams since the true nature of dreams is not known. Amram&#x27;s rules concerning the methodology of the Talmud are of considerable value.

==Siddur Rav Amram==

The most important work of Amram, marking him as one of the most prominent of the geonim before Saadiah, is his prayer book, the so-called &quot;Siddur Rav Amram&quot;. Amram was the first to arrange a complete liturgy for use in synagogue and home. His book forms the foundation both of the Spanish-Portuguese and of the German-Polish liturgies, and has exerted great influence upon Jewish religious practice for more than a thousand years, an influence which to some extent is still felt at the present day. For Amram did not content himself with giving the mere text of the prayers, but in a species of running commentary added many Talmudic and gaonic regulations relating to the prayers and their associated ceremonies. His siddur, which was made familiar by the many excerpts quoted from it by the medieval liturgical writers, and which served as the model for Saadia&#x27;s and Maimonides&#x27; own prayer texts, was published complete for the first time in Warsaw, in the year 1865 under the title &quot;Siddur Rav Amram Gaon&quot;.

The work as published is composed of two parts. The second part containing the selichot and pizmonim for the month of Elul, for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, is certainly not the work of Amram, but appears to belong to a much later period. Even the first portion, which contains the prayers proper, is full of interpolations, some of which, such as the kedushah for private prayer, are evidently later additions in the manuscripts. But not much weight can be attached even to portions of the book which are specifically given under the name of Amram; many of the explanations are certainly not by him, but by the editors who appended his name to them, speaking of him in the third person. These explanations of the prayers make no reference to any authorities later than the following: Natronai II, Amram&#x27;s teacher (17 times); Shalom, Natronai&#x27;s predecessor in the gaonate (7 times); Judah, Paltoi, Zadok, and Moses, geonim before Amram (once each); Cohen Tzedek (twice); Nahshon and Tzemach, contemporaries of Amram (twice each); and Nathan of unknown date. The only authority mentioned of later date than Amram is Saadia. This indicates that the additions to the text of the prayers must have originated in Amram&#x27;s time. Certainty on this point, however, can only be obtained by a comparison of the printed text with the manuscripts; that of Almanzi, according to the specimens given by Luzzatto, varies considerably from the printed text. Israel ben Todros (1305) mentions some azharot as having been composed by Amram; but no trace of these can now be found.

===The text===
No early manuscripts of this prayer book survive, and later manuscripts appear to be heavily edited to conform with the rites in use at the time: we therefore cannot be certain of the exact wording preferred by Amram Gaon himself. Evidence for this is:

*The manuscripts differ widely among themselves
*The text of the prayers often differs from the surviving responsa of Natronai Gaon and other contemporary authorities, and occasionally even with the halachic commentary of the siddur itself
*There are many instances where a later authority, such as Abraham ben Nathan&#x27;s &quot;Sefer ha-Manhig&quot; or David Abudirham, argues for text A &quot;as prescribed by Amram Gaon&quot; as against text B &quot;found in popular usage&quot;, but the current version of Amram Gaon shows text B.

===Relation to current rites===
The &quot;Siddur Rav Amram&quot; was originally sent to the communities of Spain, in response to a request for guidance on the laws of prayer. However, it never seems to have been adopted by them as a package deal, though they respected the individual halachic rulings contained in it. On the contrary, they appear to have edited it to suit their own requirements, so that the wording of the manuscripts and the printed version often contains variants likely to be derived from early versions of the Spanish rite. None of these early versions survives, but secondary evidence such as the Sefer ha-Manhig and the Siddur Rav Amram itself indicates that in certain respects these were different from the Sephardic rite in use today and nearer to other old European rites such as the Provençal, Italian and Old French rites, which reflect varying degrees of Palestinian influence. The later Sephardic rite has been revised to bring it into closer conformity with the rulings of the halachic codes, which themselves often reflect the opinions of the Geonim, and is therefore of a more purely Babylonian character: thus, paradoxically, it has moved away from the current wording of the &quot;Siddur Rav Amram&quot; and towards what was presumably its original wording.

Conversely, the &quot;Siddur Rav Amram&quot; was a major source used in the standardization of the nusach Ashkenaz, which was already akin to the old European family. For this reason, to a modern reader the wording of the &quot;Siddur Rav Amram&quot; appears far closer to an Ashkenazi than a Sephardi text, a fact which misled Moses Gaster into believing that the Ashkenazi rite was based on the Babylonian while the Sephardic rite was essentially Palestinian.

<text>Geoff Moore (born February 22, 1961) is an American contemporary Christian music singer. He began recording as a solo artist in 1984. In 1987, he formed Geoff Moore and The Distance, his touring band, which released eight albums generating a string of No. 1 radio hits throughout their 10+-year tenure. In 1998, Geoff retired the band from full-time touring. After a &quot;farewell tour&quot;, Moore has continued as a solo artist, releasing eight more records between 1999 and 2015. &quot;The Next Thing&quot; was released in April 2016, making it his 25th album to date.

== Early years ==

Moore was born in Flint, Michigan in 1961. His father played baseball for the Toledo Mud Hens, and later ran a steel fabrication plant. He attended Holly Area Schools at Patterson Elementary, Holly, MI through grade six and then started attending Brandon Schools in Ortonville, MI. He began singing while he was at Taylor University living in Wengatz Hall. At the time that he became a classmate to White Hearts future lead singer, Rick Florian, when he stood in for the lead singer of his roommate&#x27;s band. He graduated from Taylor in 1983. Newly married, he moved to Nashville soon after college. He was able to break into the music industry with the assistance of Michael W. Smith when the two met in the clothing store where Moore worked. He signed a publishing contract with Paragon Music, and began writing songs and singing on demo recordings. While with Paragon he wrote songs for fellow Christian singer and songwriter, Steven Curtis Chapman. Since that time, they have become best friends and have co-written numerous songs together, including the title track on Chapman&#x27;s 1992 Dove Award and Grammy winning release &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;.

During the mid-1980s, Moore recorded three solo albums released on the Power Discs label, including &quot;Where are the Other Nine?&quot;, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; and &quot;The Distance&quot;. After signing to Sparrow Records in 1987, he put together a touring band, called &quot;the Distance&quot;, to continue with his career.

== Geoff Moore and the Distance ==

In 1988, Geoff Moore and the Distance released their first official album together, entitled &quot;A Place to Stand&quot;. They also recorded &quot;Foundations&quot; in 1989 for Sparrow Records. After a year of touring, they jumped to Forefront Records and recorded &quot;Pure and Simple&quot; in 1990.

They followed in 1992 with &quot;A Friend Like U&quot;. This album would garner them their first real US Christian radio exposure with its title song. This started their most prolific period with the Grammy-nominated albums &quot;Ev-O-Lu-Tion&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Homerun&quot; in 1995. This album produced US Christian radio hits like &quot;Evolution Redefined&quot;, &quot;Life Together&quot; and &quot;Home Run&quot;. The video for &quot;Home Run&quot; featured former Major League All-Star pitcher Tim Burke.

In 1995, Benson released a compilation of hits from Moore&#x27;s first solo albums titled &quot;The Early Years&quot;. The following year the band released a double-disc greatest hits compilation which contained new unreleased bonus tracks as well as a live performance from Rome, Georgia. In 1997, the band released &quot;Threads&quot;, another Grammy-nominated album which featured a cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot; as its lead single. After more than ten years with the Distance, which he called &quot;an incredible journey&quot; in the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, Moore decided to disband the group and go his own way in 1998. In 1999 Moore returned to the studio to begin work on a new solo record. This began a new season of his music career which is still active today.

The Distance members were:

* Roscoe Meek – guitar (1990–1995)
* Guy Platter – guitar (1993–1994)
* Dale Oliver – guitar (1987–1989)
* Lang Bliss – drums (1987–1989)
* Arlin Troyer – bass guitar (1987–1990)
* Geof Barkley – keyboards, vocals (1988–1998)
* Gary Mullett – bass guitar (1990–1998)
* Greg Herrington – drums (1990–1994)
* Chuck Conner – drums (1995–1998)
* Joel McCreight – guitar (1996–1998)

== Solo career ==

In 1999, after a short time off, Moore emerged with his eponymous solo album on Forefront Records. In 2002 he followed it up with &quot;A Beautiful Sound&quot;. Near the end of 2005 he released two new studio albums independently, &quot;Every Single One Part I&quot; and &quot;Every Single One Part II,&quot;. The albums combined original songs and re-recorded selections from the out of print Forefront Records albums with The Distance.

Moore&#x27;s next project &quot;Speak to Me&quot;, released in 2007 on Rocketown Records was nominated for a Dove Award for Inspirational Album of the Year. After putting together &quot;All Along the Road Part I&quot; and &quot;All Along the Road Part II&quot;, a re-release of &quot;Every Single One&quot; with alternate tracks, Moore released &quot;Saying Grace&quot;, a collection of songs that reflect back to his upbringing, expressing &quot;gratefulness&quot; for family, for tradition, and grace in the midst of uncertainty. In 2013, Moore compiled &quot;25 Favorites&quot;, a &quot;best of&quot; double-disc, including the re-recorded material and remastered songs.

In 2015, work began on &quot;The Next Thing&quot;, his first crowdfunded recording that is scheduled to release in April 2016.

In addition to songwriting, recording, and touring, Moore enjoys hunting, fishing, and other outdoor pursuits. He and his wife have been married for 32 years, and have two sons and two adopted daughters from China.

<doc id="876881" wikidata="Q58124" url="?curid=876881" title="Zlatko Lagumdžija">
<text>Zlatko Lagumdžija (born 26 December 1955) is a Bosnian diplomat and politician serving as Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations since July 2023. He previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2001 to 2002 and from 2012 to 2015. Lagumdžija was also Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2001 to 2002. He was president of the Social Democratic Party (SDP BiH) from 1997 to 2014.

Lagumdžija was born in Sarajevo in 1955. His father Salko was mayor of Sarajevo in the 1960s. Lagumdžija graduated from the University of Sarajevo in 1981. He did postdoctoral research at the University of Arizona. Subsequently, he taught at the University of Sarajevo and later chaired the department of management information system at the Economics Faculty.

Lagumdžija began his political career during the Bosnian War as deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, advising then-president Alija Izetbegović. He accompanied Izetbegović at almost all of the peace plan negotiations during the war. 

In the 2000 parliamentary election, the SDP BiH formed a coalition with the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina to gain the majority and force the nationalist parties out of power. Lagumdžija became both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The SDP BiH-led government facilitated the passage of the Election Law, a prerequisite to Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s accession to the Council of Europe. Lagumdžija&#x27;s party led the government until the 2002 general election, when the nationalist parties were elected back into power. He then served as member of the national House of Representatives.

As president of the SDP BiH, Lagumdžija took part in many constitutional reform talks, most notably in those regarding the 2010–2012 government formation. Following the 2010 general election and the SDP BiH&#x27;s emergence as the largest party in the House of Representatives, a government was formed around the SDP BiH and the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, with Lagumdžija once again becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving until 2015. Following the 2014 general election and a poor showing of the SDP BiH, he resigned as president of the party. In 2019, he was removed from the SDP BiH due to political activity in his own new political party.

Lagumdžija is a member of the Club of Madrid, an independent non-profit organization created to promote democracy and change in the international community.

==Education==
Lagumdžija earned his high school diploma as a part of the Youth For Understanding exchange student program in Allen Park, Michigan in 1973. 

His subsequent education was at the University of Sarajevo, where he earned a BS in 1977, an MS in 1981 and a PhD in 1988 in the field of Computer science and Electrical engineering.

In 1989, as a Fulbright Program participant, Lagumdžija did postdoctoral research at the University of Arizona in the Department of Management Information Systems and the Center for the Management of Information.

==Academic career==
Lagumdžija began teaching at the University of Sarajevo in 1989 as a professor of management information system and informatics at the Economics Faculty and Projected Information Systems and Group Support Systems at the Electrical Engineering Faculty.

He served as the chair of the department of Management and Information Systems at the Economics Faculty since 1994 and the director of the director of the Management and Information Technologies Center (an organizational unit of the Economics Faculty) since 1995.

Lagumdžija&#x27;s particular academic interests lie in the areas of Group Support Systems and management information systems. He is the author of six books and over a hundred papers in the field of management information systems.

At the end of the Bosnian War, Lagumdžija helped to secure funds from the Soros Foundation with which to rebuild the Group Support System facility at the University of Sarajevo. The strategic objective of the Management and Information Technologies Center, which housed the GSS facility, was to &quot;assist and promote the transition of Bosnia and Herzegovina to a democratic, market-driven economy.&quot; 

As part of that mandate, the Center held sessions for key business and government leaders as well as students at the University of Sarajevo utilizing GSS technology to assist them in thinking about and planning for the economic reconstruction of Sarajevo.

==Political career==
===Wartime political career===
Lagumdžija began his political career during the Bosnian War as deputy prime minister, advising then-president Alija Izetbegović. 

In one particular case he advised him not to sign the Vance–Owen Peace Plan: &quot;Mr Izetbegović was not endorsing it, but thinking out loud and saying perhaps the plan would not be so bad, that we could live with it. And some of us told him, &#x27;Anyone who signs this plan will be dead, and not just politically…&#x27;&quot; he told a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter in February 1993. 

Izetbegović signed the peace plan in March 1993. In May 1992, Lagumdžija was with Izetbegović, Izetbegović’s daughter Sabina and his bodyguard, returning from the Lisbon negotiations, when they were surrounded at the Sarajevo International Airport by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, kidnapped and driven in a convoy to Lukavica, in Serb-held territory.

In April 1993, Lagumdžija met with a group of citizens from Srebrenica who had journeyed through the Serb lines to Sarajevo. They informed him of the desperate situation of Srebrenica and the eastern Bosnian enclaves. In an effort to highlight the plight of Srebrenica, Lagumdžija suspended humanitarian aid donations for Sarajevo until aid was delivered to the eastern enclaves. A month later, United Nations (UN) Commander Philippe Morillon visited Srebrenica and declared the citizens under the protection of the UN.

===Post-war political career===
As a member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP BiH), Lagumdžija served as member of the national House of Representatives from 2002 to 2012. He was the president of the SDP BiH from 1997 to 2014.

At the 2000 parliamentary election, the SDP BiH formed a coalition with the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a party founded and led by former wartime prime minister Haris Silajdžić, to gain the majority and force the nationalist parties out of power. They gathered a coalition of many other small parties to create the &quot;Alliance for Change&quot;. Lagumdžija became the Foreign Minister, a post he served in from 2001 until 2002, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, serving until 2002. After protracted negotiations, disagreements and delays, he signed the Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name=&quot;NN 2/2004 (17.3.2004.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When the SDP BiH came into political power on a platform of economic reform and anti-corruption, Lagumdžija was lauded by the Western powers as the hopeful &quot;face of a pluralistic, united Bosnia.&quot; The SDP BiH-led government facilitated the passage of the Election Law, which was not only an important step towards democracy, but also a prerequisite to Bosnia&#x27;s accession to the Council of Europe. The SDP BiH led the coalition government until the October 2002 general election, when the public, dissatisfied at the pace of political reform, elected the nationalist parties back into power.

On 18 May 2019, Lagumdžija was removed from the SDP BiH due to his political activity in his own new political party, the Social Democratic Movement, which was in the process of being founded, and which was also supported by Bosnian Presidency member and former SDP BiH vice-president Željko Komšić.

====2010–2012 government formation====

Following the 2010 general election, a process of formation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Council of Ministers (i.e. the national government) had begun. The resulting election produced a fragmented political landscape without a coalition of a parliamentary majority more than a year after the election. The SDP BiH, led by Lagumdžija, and the Bosnian Serb autonomist Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), each had 8 MPs of the total 42 MPs of the House of Representatives.

The major Croat (HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990) and Serb parties (SNSD and SDS) contended that a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement existed in which the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers rotates between the three constitutional nationalities. In this case, it would be the turn for a Croat politician to chair the Council. As the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH) and the Croatian Democratic Union 1990 (HDZ 1990) received the overwhelming share of Croat votes in the 2010 general election, the parties demanded that a member of one of them receive the position of Chairman. The SDP BiH on the other hand, claimed that the only necessity is the ethnicity of the individual, and not the party, demanding the right to appoint a Croat Chairman from SDP BiH ranks, calling upon the right of having assumed most votes nationwide.

The European Union and the Office of the High Representative repeatedly attempted negotiations to appease the Bosniak–Bosnian and Serb–Croat divided political blocs, in parallel to the Bosnian constitutional crisis, all ending in failure. The Bosniak-Bosnian coalition insisted that the seat would have to go to them as the party that received the largest number of votes, while the Serb–Croat alliance insisted that due to the fact that according to tradition, the next Chairman of the Council of Ministers must be an ethnic Croat, it must come from an authentic Croat party (Croatian Democratic Union), and not the multi-ethnic SDP BiH.

A round of talks between party leaders was held in Mostar on 5 September 2011, hosted by Croat politicians Božo Ljubić and Dragan Čović, with Milorad Dodik, Mladen Bosić, Sulejman Tihić and Lagumdžija in attendance. The parties agreed to a further round of discussion in mid-September. A meeting between the six major party leaders was held in Sarajevo on 15 September, hosted by Lagumdžija. Topics discussed at the meeting included holding a national census, military assets and the Sejdić-Finci ruling. On the same day, an EU spokesperson warned that the country risked losing funding through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance if the political situation did not stabilize. Another meeting on 26 September 2011 failed as well.

An agreement was finally reached on 28 December 2011 between the six political parties: the Social Democratic Party, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the Croatian Democratic Union, the Croatian Democratic Union 1990, the Serb Democratic Party and the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats. Vjekoslav Bevanda, a Bosnian Croat, became the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

Following the government&#x27;s formation and Bevanda&#x27;s appointment, Lagumdžija again became Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving until 2015.

====Constitutional reform====

As “credible efforts” towards the implementation of the Sejdić–Finci ruling remained the outstanding condition for the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, in June 2012, Czech Commissioner Štefan Füle launched a High Level Dialogue on the Accession Process (HLAD) with Bosnia and Herzegovina, tackling both the Sejdić–Finci issue and the need for a coordination mechanism for the country to speak with a single voice in the accession process. Talks were held in June and November 2012, with little success.

In the summer of 2012, HDZ BiH leader Dragan Čović and Lagumdžija agreed on the indirect election of the Bosnian Presidency members by the Bosnian Parliament, but the deal was not turned into detailed amendments. The HDZ BiH kept calling for electoral reform to prevent new Komšić cases. The same Željko Komšić left the SDP BiH shortly after, in dissent with the agreement which would have excluded him from acceding to power again. The SDA also opposed it, as it would have created a further asymmetry, with one Presidency member (from Republika Srpska) elected directly, and two elected indirectly.

In February 2013, the European Commission decided to step up its involvement, with the direct facilitation of talks by Füle, in coordination with the Council of Europe&#x27;s secretary-general Thorbjørn Jagland. In March and April 2013, with the support of the Director-General for Enlargement Stefano Sannino, the EU Delegation in Sarajevo facilitated a series of direct talks between party leaders, with no concrete outcome.

==Controversies==
===Algerian Six===

In the end of 2001, six citizens of Algerian origin (the so-called &quot;Algerian Six&quot;) were accused of planning a terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Sarajevo. They were taken into custody in October, and the Bosnian government, headed by Lagumdžija, revoked their citizenship in November. After a 3-month-process, the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina ordered their release based on lack of evidence.

However, Washington came out with a request for their extradition because &quot;the U.S. still believes they are a threat to American interests and that the US Government refused to publicly disclose evidence to the court in Bosnia and Herzegovina because it would endanger its methods of intelligence-gathering.&quot; While the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina was deciding about this request, protests broke out in front of the Sarajevo prison. Eventually, Lagumdžija&#x27;s government yielded to the demand, and the six were deported to Guantánamo Bay. In 2009, an investigation by the Cantonal prosecution of Sarajevo against Lagumdžija, the ex-Federal Minister of Interior Tomislav Limov and others involved was launched but later dropped. Another one was launched three years later, but it was dropped quickly too. Two of the three that returned to Bosnia still hold Lagumdžija responsible for their illegal imprisonment and filed a lawsuit against the state.

===&quot;Coup d&#x27;état affair&quot;===
In September 2003, Lagumdžija and Munir Alibabić, the former director of the Federal Intelligence and Security Service (FOSS), were accused of conspiring to take over the government by Ivan Vuksić, the FOSS director at the time. The accusations were based on the illegal recordings of telephone conversations between the two men. The Sarajevo daily paper &quot;Dnevni avaz&quot; picked up the story and ran a series of articles which attacked Lagumdžija and blamed him of being behind the August 2003 explosions that had taken place in Sarajevo. He denied the accusations and released a public statement to the court, which read in part, &quot;Any well-informed and well-intentioned person will know that all these accusations are based on vicious lies, and that their progenitors are provoking a situation, which would bring them to face justice in court in any organized democratic state.&quot; The court dismissed the accusations, Lagumdžija eventually sued &quot;Dnevni avaz&quot; for libel and the newspaper was ordered to pay him 10,000 BAM in damages.

==Personal life==
Zlatko is married to Amina Lagumdžija, and has three children. His father Salko (1921–1973) was the 22nd mayor of Sarajevo from 1965 to 1967.

<text>The Sopot International Song Festival or Sopot Festival (later called &quot;Sopot Music Festival Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;Sopot Top of the Top Festival&quot; from 2012–13 and &quot;Polsat Sopot Festival&quot; in 2014) is an annual international song contest held in Sopot, Poland. It is the biggest Polish music festival altogether with the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, and one of the biggest song contests in Europe. Over the years, Elton John, Gloria Gaynor, Demis Roussos, Alla Pugacheva, Scorpions, Anastacia, Maryla Rodowicz, In-Grid and other popular performers from around the world performed at the festival.

The contest was organised and transmitted live by the public Polish Television (TVP) between 1994 and 2004. The following year, the concert was broadcast by the private media station TVN for the first time and remained on TVN until 2009. From 2012 to 2014, the concert was broadcast and organised by Polsat. It was later cancelled by the broadcaster. The 2015 festival was not televised, however it returned in 2017 on TVN.

==History==

The first Sopot festival was initiated and organised in 1961 by Władysław Szpilman, assisted by Szymon Zakrzewski from Polish Artists Management (PAGART). The first three editions were held in the Gdansk Shipyard hall (1961–1963), after which the festival moved to the Forest Opera. The main prize has been Amber Nightingale through most of its history.

Between 1977 and 1980 it was replaced by the Intervision Song Contest, which was still held in Sopot. Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, the Sopot International Music Festival often changed its formulas to pick a winner and offered many different contests for its participants. For example, at the 4th Intervision Song Festival (held in Sopot August 20–23, 1980) two competitions were effective: one for artists representing television companies, the other for those representing record companies. In the first the jury considered the artistic merits of the songs entered; while in the second, it judged the performers&#x27; interpretation.&quot;

The festival has always been open to non-European acts, and countries like Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mongolia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa and many others have been represented in this event.

The contest lost popularity in Poland and abroad in the 1980s, declining further during the 1990s, and the rather unconvincing organisations by TVP made the authorities of Sopot give the organization of the 2005 Sopot International Song Festival to a private TV channel, TVN.

Since 1999, there was no contest. TVP chose to invite well-known artists instead, featuring the likes of Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, The Corrs, Lionel Richie, UB40, Ricky Martin and Simply Red to perform. In 2005, TVN brought the international competition back, taking over from TVP, and in 2006 invited Elton John and Katie Melua. The Sopot International Song Festival is usually considered bigger than the Benidorm International Song Festival because of its ability to attract star performers.
In 2010 and 2011, the festival did not take place due to renovation of the Forest Opera. Since 2012, it is called &quot;Sopot Top Of The Top Festival&quot; and is broadcast annually by Polsat. In 2014, the name was changed to &quot;Polsat Sopot Festival&quot;. In 2015, Polsat decided not to organize the festival. However, the city authorities decided to organize a one-day festival in Sopot this year, but without a television broadcast.

In 2016, the concert did not take place due to the lack of a television partner, which initially was to be TVP. After a year of break, the decision was made to restore the festival. Since 2017, it has been organized and broadcast by TVN again.

The festival also provided opportunity to listen to international stars. In the past, it featured Charles Aznavour, Demis Roussos, Boney M, Gloria Gaynor, Petula Clark, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Shirley Bassey, Village People, Kool and the Gang, Vanessa Mae, Sabrina, C.C.Catch, Annie Lennox, Paul Young, Marillion, Scorpions, Alphaville, Kim Wilde, Bonnie Tyler, Jimmy Somerville, Erasure, Belinda Carlisle, Vaya Con Dios, Chris Rea, Bryan Adams, Tanita Tikaram, La Toya Jackson, Rick Astley, Shakin’ Stevens, Londonbeat, Bad Boys Blue, Technotronic. Kajagoogoo, Limahl, Goran Bregovic, Norah Jones, Anastacia, Maryla Rodowicz, Ricky Martin, In-Grid, Alla Pugacheva and many others.

==Winners by year==

This list includes only winners of the most prestigious contests within the Sopot Music Festival. Sometimes one contest has overshadowed another with time. &quot;Grand Prix de disque&quot; was the most prestigious award between 1974 and 1976 and the Intervision Song Contest during 1977–80. Since the 1980s, the main prize of the festival is the &quot;Amber Nightingale&quot; award.

The festival has also given prizes for &quot;Best Interpretation&quot; in the 1960s, and &quot;Winner Of The Polish Day&quot; on and off from the 1960s to the 1980s.

<doc id="876894" wikidata="Q138861" url="?curid=876894" title="Four corners (Canada)">
<text>The four corners is a quadripoint near 60° N 102° W where four Canadian provinces or territories meet. These are the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan and the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. It came into being with the creation of Nunavut on April 1, 1999.

==Geography==
The four corners area is located between Kasba Lake to the north and Hasbala Lake to the south. It is located by an area of marginal taiga forest, which happens to be the only place in Nunavut which is not Arctic tundra or ice cap. It is hundreds of kilometres from any road or railway, but can be accessed from nearby Kasba Lake Airport/Water Aerodrome as well as from Points North Landing near Wollaston Lake.

During the winter of 1961–1962 (37 years prior the formation of Nunavut), a survey crew led by Lionel E. Boutiler installed 85 survey monuments along the northernmost section of the Saskatchewan–Manitoba border. The crew worked from south to north along the Second Meridian as defined in the system of Dominion Land Surveys. The final monument, designated  157, officially marked the intersection of the boundaries of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Unlike the standard survey monuments along the provincial and territorial borders, Monument 157 is an aluminum obelisk that stands about one metre tall. Photos can be seen in the original survey report. On the top of the monument is a cap that states &quot;5 years imprisonment for removal&quot;.

The exact location of Monument 157 (measured with modern GPS technologies) is (NAD83). This places it roughly 421 metres west of 102° W and roughly 63 metres south of 60°N. Elevation is 347.9 metres.

The establishment of Nunavut in 1999 led to the creation of Canada&#x27;s only quadripoint. In the legal definition of Nunavut, its border is specified as &quot;Commencing at the intersection of 60°00′ N latitude with 102°00′ W longitude, being the intersection of the Manitoba, Northwest Territories and Saskatchewan borders&quot;. Since the intersection does not lie exactly at those coordinates, the laws left a legal ambiguity regarding the exact commencement point of the boundary.

In 2014, the Survey General Branch (SGB) of Natural Resources Canada acknowledged there was a problem with the legal boundary definition; it decided that the boundary should commence at Monument 157.
Specifically it decided that the first leg of the boundary should be a 472 km geodesic line running from Monument 157 to the first turning point at 64°14′N 102°00′W(NAD27).
This decision confirmed that in the eyes of Natural Resources Canada, the two territories and two provinces do indeed meet at a quadripoint.

In September 2014, the federal government paid for an official survey of the 472 km line. The survey crew, following instructions from the SGB, installed 48 new Canada Lands survey monuments along the geodesic line. As of 2021, the ambiguous legislation has not been repealed or updated to acknowledge the existence of the surveyed boundary, but based on legal precedent from the Dominion Land Survey, the surveyed boundary legally prevails over the description of the boundary in the original legislation.

<text>Elizabeth Josephine Brawley Hughes (December 22, 1839 – March 1926) was an advocate of women&#x27;s rights in the United States West region. George W. P. Hunt described her as the Mother of Arizona.

==Biography==
Elizabeth Josephine Brawley (she dropped her first name later in life) was born on a farm near Meadville, Pennsylvania, on December 22, 1839, to John R. Brawley and Sarah Haskins. After graduating from Edinboro State Normal School, she was a teacher for two years in Pennsylvania public schools.

While a student at Edinboro, she met Louis C. Hughes, whom she married in 1868. Because of a Civil War wound, Louis moved to the Arizona Territory in 1871 and Josephine followed in 1872 with their first child, Gertrude. Josephine and the baby traveled first by rail to San Francisco, then by boat to San Diego, and finally by stagecoach to Tucson. During the trip, Hughes carried a loaded rifle in one arm and her infant daughter in the other. According to a biography by Louise Boehringer in the January 1930 edition of the &quot;Arizona Historical Review&quot;, at the time of Josephine&#x27;s arrival, &quot;Only two other (Eastern) homemakers were established in Tucson when the young wife and mother reached her destination–Mrs. Charles Lord (wife of Dr. Lord) and Mrs. C. Scott (wife of Judge C. Scott).&quot; Thus, Hughes may have been the third English-speaking woman in Tucson.

The family lived in an adobe home like the rest of &quot;The Old Pueblo&quot; (a nickname for Tucson), but it did contain the town&#x27;s first cistern. Hughes had three children after Gertrude: John, Josephine, and a child that died at age two. 

Hughes taught in the first public school for girls in Tucson. She also worked in the office of her husband&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Arizona Star.&quot; 

In 1893, Louis was appointed territorial governor by President Grover Cleveland. Their son, John T., later served in the first state Senate.

Louis died in 1915 and John in 1921, leaving Hughes with no other family in Arizona. She moved to California to be closer to her daughter, where she died in 1926.

The Arizona State Capitol building in Phoenix has a bronze plaque in its rotunda in Josephine&#x27;s honor, placed December 16, 1926.

==Activism==
Hughes was the first president of the Arizona Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Association. The Arizona WCTU, like the national WCTU, believed that women needed the right to vote so that they could regulate alcohol and other forms of vice in their communities. She traveled around the Arizona Territory denouncing &quot;Demon Rum&quot; and promoting temperance. 

In 1891, as the push for Arizona statehood began, Hughes helped to found the first woman suffrage organization in Arizona Territory. The organization hoped that women&#x27;s right to vote would be included in the state constitution. From 1891 to 1900, she was a major advocate for the women&#x27;s suffrage bill, which was vetoed in 1900 by Governor Alexander Oswald Brodie. Despite her efforts, Arizona&#x27;s women did not gain the right to vote until 1912. 

==Accomplishments==

<text>The Congress for Democracy and Progress (, &quot;CDP&quot;) was the ruling party in Burkina Faso from 1996 until the overthrow of Blaise Compaoré in 2014.

==History==
The party was founded in February 1996 by merger of the Organization for Popular Democracy – Labour Movement and nine parties supportive of it (the National Convention of Progressive Patriots–Social Democratic Party, the Party for Democracy and Rally, the Movement for Socialist Democracy, the Union of Social Democrats, the Group of Revolutionary Democrats, the Rally of Social-Democrat Independents, the Party for Panafricanism and Unity, the Union of Democrats and Patriots of Burkina and the Party of Action for the Liberalism in Solidarity), as well as factions of the Group of Patriotic Democrats and the Burkinabé Socialist Bloc.

From 1992, when the office of Prime Minister was reestablished, until Blaise Compaoré was ousted in 2014, all Prime Ministers of Burkina Faso were members of the CDP, along with most other national officials, and the party held the most seats in Parliament.

In the parliamentary election held on 5 May 2002, the party won 49.5% of the popular vote and 57 out of 111 seats.

In the 13 November 2005 presidential election, the CDP candidate, President Compaoré, won 80.35% of the popular vote. At the May 2007 parliamentary election, the party expanded its majority, winning 73 seats.

In 2012, Assimi Kouanda was elected as the CDP&#x27;s National Executive Secretary.

The party still had representation in parliament after the overthrow of Compaoré in October 2014, as well as following the November 2015 general elections.

The CDP held its sixth ordinary congress in Ouagadougou on 9–10 May 2015. Eddie Komboïgo, a businessman who had been a Deputy in the National Assembly prior to its 2014 dissolution, was elected as President of the CDP, while Compaoré was designated as Honorary President. On 11 July 2015, Komboïgo was designated as the CDP&#x27;s candidate for the October 2015 presidential election. Komboïgo was subsequently barred from standing, and the CDP had no presidential candidate; however, it won 18 out of 127 seats in the concurrent parliamentary election. Meanwhile, party leaders were accused of involvement in the failed September 2015 coup, leading to the arrest of Komboïgo as well as a party vice-president, Léonce Koné. Together with various other opposition parties, the CDP formed the Coalition for Democracy and National Reconciliation on 16 October 2016; seeking to promote political reconciliation, it was mostly composed of forces that had backed Compaoré. The coalition stood in opposition to President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré and the ruling People&#x27;s Movement for Progress (MPP), but it was distinct from the main opposition coalition, the Coalition of Democratic Forces for Real Change led by Zéphirin Diabré.

On 19 April 2017, the CDP criticized the forthcoming trial of Compaoré (&quot;in absentia&quot;) and members of his government in connection with efforts to suppress the October 2014 protests that led to the fall of the government. According to the CDP, the trial was a politically motivated &quot;witch hunt&quot; and &quot;a clear violation of the rule of law&quot;.

She is known for starring as Bridget Hennessy on the ABC sitcom &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; (2002–2005), Penny on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; (2007–2019), and as the title character in the HBO Max comedic thriller &quot;The Flight Attendant&quot; (2020–2022). The last earned her nominations for Primetime Emmy Awards and Golden Globe Awards.

Cuoco has also played Billie Jenkins in the fantasy series &quot;Charmed&quot; (2005–2006), voiced the title role in the animated series &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; since 2019, and played the lead role in the comedy thriller series &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; (2023).

She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014 and in 2017 founded Yes, Norman Productions.

==Early life==
Kaley Christine Cuoco was born on November 30, 1985, in Camarillo, California. She is the elder daughter of Layne Ann (née Wingate), a homemaker, and Gary Carmine Cuoco, a real estate agent. Her father is of Italian descent while her mother is of English and German ancestry. Her sister, Briana, is an actress and singer who competed on the fifth season of &quot;The Voice&quot; who co-starred with her on the HBO Max series &quot;The Flight Attendant&quot; and on &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; as Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. As a child, Cuoco was a ranked amateur tennis player, a sport she took up when she was three years old. She stopped playing at the age of 16 to pursue a career in acting.

==Career==
===1995–2006: Early work and &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;===
Cuoco made her first feature film appearance as the young Karin Carter in the 1995 action thriller &quot;Virtuosity&quot;. From 2000 to 2001, she appeared on the CBS sitcom &quot;Ladies Man&quot; and in 2000 she portrayed former &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; star Maureen McCormick in the TV film &quot;Growing Up Brady&quot; as well as starring in the Disney Channel original film &quot;Alley Cats Strike&quot;. In September 2002, she began a starring role as Bridget Hennessy on the ABC sitcom &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot; (afterwards &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;). Bridget was the oldest child, despite Cuoco being six years younger than Amy Davidson, who played her younger sister.

In addition to the final season of &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;, Cuoco had starring roles on the NBC miniseries &quot;10.5&quot;, the ABC Family original film &quot;Crimes of Fashion&quot;, the independent film &quot;Debating Robert Lee&quot;, and in the film &quot;The Hollow&quot; at the same time. She also voiced the character of Brandy Harrington, a 14-year-old anthropomorphic mixed-breed dog, on the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Brandy and Mr. Whiskers&quot;. She voiced the character of Kirstee Smith in &quot;Bratz&quot; from 2004 to 2005. In the eighth season of the TV series &quot;Charmed&quot;, she appeared as Billie Jenkins, a powerful young witch with the powers of telekinesis and projection. Executive producer Brad Kern stated that Cuoco&#x27;s character was initially brought in as a possible spin-off.

===2007–2016: &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and other roles===

In September 2007, Cuoco began starring in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, playing Penny, a Cheesecake Factory employee and aspiring actress who lives across the hall from physicists Dr. Leonard Hofstadter and Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Prior to the 2010–2011 season, she earned US$60,000 an episode for the series, the same as her co-stars. In 2010, the cast negotiated a raise for each actor to make US$200,000 per episode. As of August 2014, Cuoco and her co-stars from &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons each earned an estimated US$1 million per episode.

In late October 2012, Cuoco enlisted the help of her sister Briana to organize a flash mob on the set of the show, in which she and the cast and crew surprised the studio audience by suddenly lip syncing and dancing to Carly Rae Jepsen&#x27;s song &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot;. A video of the event was posted on YouTube and became a viral success. A clip from the performance was also played during Cuoco&#x27;s January 8, 2013, appearance on the late-night talk show &quot;Conan&quot;.
Cuoco starred in the Lifetime film &quot;To Be Fat like Me&quot;, which premiered on January 8, 2007. She played a minor role in the &quot;Prison Break&quot; episodes &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;, as well as starring in the comedy horror spoof &quot;Killer Movie&quot; in 2008. She also appeared in the 2010 film &quot;The Penthouse&quot;. In 2011, she posed nude in &quot;Allure&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual &quot;Naked Truth&quot; feature. That same year, she appeared in the films &quot;Hop&quot; and &quot;The Last Ride&quot;. She was also chosen to host the Teen Choice Awards in 2011, as well as the People&#x27;s Choice Awards in 2012 and 2013. She is a regular on Priceline.com commercials as the daughter of William Shatner&#x27;s character.

===2017–present: &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; animated series and &quot;The Flight Attendant&quot;===
In October 2017, Cuoco founded Yes, Norman Productions, a television production company which entered an exclusive multi-year first-look production deal with Warner Bros. Television. Her first project through Yes, Norman was an adaptation of the book &quot;The Flight Attendant&quot;, written by author Chris Bohjalian, which was developed into a comedy-drama series of the same name. Cuoco starred in the series as Cassie Bowden, and also served as executive producer. &quot;The Flight Attendant&quot; premiered on November 26, 2020, on WarnerMedia&#x27;s streaming platform HBO Max to widespread critical acclaim, and was renewed for a second season on December 18, 2020.

In October 2018, it was announced that Cuoco would voice the title character of the DC Universe adult animation series &quot;Harley Quinn&quot;, and also serve as executive producer. The series premiered on November 29, 2019, to critical acclaim. In September 2020, it was announced that the series was renewed for a third season and would move to HBO Max.

In August 2019, it was announced that Cuoco would executive produce the upcoming CBS comedy &quot;Pretty&quot;, which is written and also executive produced by Lindsey Kraft and Santina Muha. In April 2020, Cuoco joined the cast of the upcoming action comedy film &quot;The Man from Toronto&quot; as the female lead alongside Kevin Hart and Woody Harrelson.

In March 2021, it was announced that Cuoco would play Doris Day in an upcoming limited series based on A. E. Hotchner&#x27;s 1976 biography, &quot;Doris Day: Her Own Story&quot;. She will also serve as an executive producer of the series. In May 2021, her production company expanded its Warner Bros. Television overall deal.

==Personal life==
While working on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, Cuoco privately dated co-star Johnny Galecki for roughly two years, until December 2009. She later told &quot;CBS Watch&quot; in September 2010 that they have remained on good terms since ending their relationship.

On September 13, 2010, Cuoco broke her leg in a horse-riding accident and missed the filming of two episodes of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.

In October 2011, she became engaged to addiction specialist Josh Resnik, but ended their engagement by March 2012. She became engaged to professional tennis player Ryan Sweeting in September 2013, after three months of dating. They married on December 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California. On September 25, 2015, it was announced that she and Sweeting had decided to divorce. The divorce was finalized on May 9, 2016.

Cuoco began dating equestrian Karl Cook in late 2016. They became engaged on November 30, 2017, Cuoco&#x27;s 32nd birthday, and were married on June 30, 2018. In September 2021, the couple announced their separation, stating &quot;we have realized that our current paths have taken us in opposite directions&quot;. In June 2022, their divorce was finalized.

Cuoco confirmed her relationship with actor Tom Pelphrey in May 2022. Five months later, she announced on Instagram that they were expecting their first child together. Cuoco gave birth to their daughter Matilda on March 30, 2023. They announced their engagement on August 14, 2024.

<text>Charles H. Kraft (born 1932 in Connecticut) is an American anthropologist, linguist, evangelical Christian speaker, and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Intercultural Communication in the School of Intercultural Studies at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, where he taught primarily in the school&#x27;s spiritual-dynamics concentration. In the domain of religion, his work since the early 1980s has focused on inner healing and spiritual warfare. He joined Fuller&#x27;s faculty in 1969. In the 1950s he served as a Brethren missionary in northern Nigeria. He has served as a professor of African languages at Michigan State University and UCLA, and taught anthropology part-time at Biola University. He holds a BA from Wheaton College, a BD from Ashland Theological Seminary, and a PhD from the Hartford Seminary Foundation, titled &quot;A Study of Hausa Syntax&quot;.

In 1982, with fellow Fuller missions professor Peter Wagner, Kraft became an early proponent of the teaching and ministry models of John Wimber, and helped popularize the &quot;Third Wave of the Holy Spirit&quot;, which Wimber&#x27;s Vineyard Movement represented. He was also an influential figure in the development of spiritual mapping, which drew on the Church Growth movement.

== Main interests ==

Kraft writes and teaches about biblical Christianity and culture (including contextualization), communicating biblical Christianity, anthropology and Christianity, cross-cultural Christian theology, worldview, spiritual warfare, inner healing, generational curses, and Anti-Masonry. In addition to his work at Fuller, Kraft is the president and founder of Deep Healing Ministries, a deliverance ministry, and conducts seminars and exorcisms around the world. He lives in California with his wife. He serves as the Vice-President of Hearts Set Free Ministries, where he conducts seminars on spiritual warfare, healing, and deliverance.

His most influential and controversial work is &quot;Christianity in Culture&quot; (1979). He proposed an approach to contextualization using the &quot;dynamic equivalence&quot; method of Bible translation as a model to describe how Christianity itself must be translated into a culture by adopting new forms that communicate biblical meanings.

He has taught and ministered in Nigeria, Korea, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Australia, India, Denmark, Norway, England, Holland, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany.

<text>Despina Malea (; born 22 July 1969), known as Despina Vandi (), is a Greek singer. Born in Tübingen near Stuttgart, Germany, Vandi&#x27;s family returned to Kavala, Greece when she was six years old.

After moving to Athens in the early 1990s, Vandi signed with Minos EMI and released two albums &quot;Gela Mou&quot; (1994) and &quot;Esena Perimeno&quot; (1996). She then began an exclusive collaboration with songwriter/producer Phoebus and achieved commercial success with her third album, &quot;Deka Endoles&quot; (1997), followed by the multi-platinum &quot;Profities&quot; (1999), as she established a more &quot;pop&quot; stage performance style and image, becoming one of the most prominent artists of the laïko/pop genre.

Her single &quot;Ipofero&quot; (2000) became the best-selling single of all-time in Greece. Following Phoebus&#x27; departure from Minos EMI, Vandi followed him to the newly formed independent label Heaven Music and released &quot;Gia&quot; (2001), which became and remains her biggest commercial success, as well as one of the best-selling albums of all time in Greece and Cyprus. Vandi also released the album abroad and the self-titled single &quot;Gia&quot;, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Airplay and making her the first Greek artist to top a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. She returned with &quot;Stin Avli Tou Paradeisou&quot; (2004), which was certified multi-platinum and became her fourth album to achieve six-figure sales. In 2007 &quot;10 Hronia Mazi&quot;, a ten-year celebration of her collaboration with Phoebus was released, followed by her eighth studio album &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot;. In 2012 she released the album &quot;Allaxa&quot;, which was certified 2× platinum sales and has been her first double platinum record since 2005.

Vandi has won three Arion Music Awards, ten MAD Video Music Awards, seven Pop Corn Music Awards, and a World Music Award, becoming the first Greek artist recording in Greece to ever win the award. On 14 March 2010, Alpha TV ranked Vandi the fourth top-certified Greek female artist in the nation&#x27;s phonographic era (since 1960), with 11 records having been certified platinum or multi-platinum and three gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry of Greece. According to Heaven Music, as of 2007, Vandi has sold one million records in Greece. In the aftermath of her success, Vandi gained the title of the &quot;queen&quot; of Greek music. From 2013 to 2015, she was one of the four artists/coaches participating in the Greek version of &quot;The Voice&quot; called &quot;The Voice of Greece&quot;. And she was one of the four artists/coaches in Rising Star in 2016.

==Life and career==
===Early years (&quot;Gela mou&quot; &amp; &quot;Esena Perimeno&quot; 1994–96)===
Vandi&#x27;s first album was released in 1994 under the Minos EMI label, titled &quot;Gela Mou&quot; (Smile at Me). The album was distinguished by the self-titled song &quot;Gela Mou&quot;, as long as by the song &quot;Den iparhi tipota&quot; and her duet &quot;To Adieksodo&quot; (No Way Out) with the popular and acclaimed singer Giannis Parios. Both songs were written by Vassilis Karras.

In 1996, Vandi released her next album, &quot;Esena Perimeno&quot; (You&#x27;re The One I&#x27;m Waiting For). Singles on the album include &quot;Esena Perimeno&quot;, &quot;Den Pethainei I Agapi&quot;, and &quot;Efiges&quot;. Most of the songs were written by her friend and now musical director Tony Kontaxakis. Although a few of her first songs received some airplay, the first two albums themselves had mild success. Together the albums have sold under 30 thousand copies. A statement made by Vandi implied the combined album sales to be in the range of 10–27 thousand copies.

===Beginning of Phoebus era and breakthrough (&quot;Deka Entoles&quot; &amp; &quot;Profities&quot; 1997–99)===
1997 would be the year Vandi would make her breakthrough in mainstream Greek music as she teamed up with popular songwriter Phoebus. Phoebus wrote the songs of Vandi&#x27;s next album, &quot;Deka Entoles&quot; (Ten Commandments), which was certified double platinum and sold 100,000 copies in Greece. Vandi&#x27;s partnership with Phoebus would turn out to be one of the most notable in the Greek recording industry and they would continue to have commercial success for a decade and more (they celebrated their 10-year partnership with the release of 10 Hronia Mazi (10 Years Together)). With the success of &quot;Deka Entoles&quot; Vandi quickly became popular in the Greek music industry with a string of hits and popular appearances.

In 1998 Vandi released the platinum cd-single &quot;Spania&quot;, while later that year, she experimented with acting. She was asked to play a guest star role in the hit television show &quot;Dio Xeni&quot; (Two Strangers). Vandi accepted the role and made her first appearance on television. She played a singer of a local small city, who was able to change the sexuality of the main gay character. She managed to gain good reviews for her acting talent.

Vandi&#x27;s next album &quot;Profities&quot; (Prophecies) was released in 1999 and was certified gold the day of its release and platinum in 2 days. It eventually became triple platinum, selling 150 thousand copies. Big hits from the album were the songs: &quot;Apapa&quot;, &quot;To Giatriko&quot;, &quot;To Koritsaki sou&quot; and &quot;Sta Dosa Ola&quot;. Later that year Vandi gave her first sold-out solo concert at the concert hall of Lycabettus with 7,000 people in attendance.

===Move to &quot;Heaven music&quot; and commercial peak (&quot;Gia&quot;, 2000–01)===
In 2000, Despina Vandi released the single &quot;Ipofero&quot; (I Suffer). The single was certified six times platinum and was awarded as being the most successful single of all time in Greece, based on sales at the Virgin Megastores, which reached 150 thousand copies. An honorary award was given to her by Richard Branson of Virgin in London, England.

In 2001 Despina Vandi and Phoebus signed in with Heaven Music, a new break-out record label, owned by the Antenna Group. Despina&#x27;s following album &quot;Gia&quot; (2001), meaning &quot;Hi&quot; was a double album including 21 new songs. The album was certified 4× platinum in only 11 days and became one of the best-selling albums of all time in Greece. Many of the songs on the album became hits not only Greece, but also in neighboring countries such as Cyprus, Turkey and Lebanon. Shortly after, Vandi gave an open free concert in Thessaloniki singing in front of a crowd of more than 60,000 people.

At the 2002 &quot;World Music Awards&quot;, Vandi was awarded as the World&#x27;s &quot;Best Selling Greek Artist&quot;. It was the first time that this award was given to a Greek artist who actually lived and worked in Greece. For her acceptance speech, Vandi said &quot;Above all though, I would like to thank my Greek fans around the world. I dedicate this award to all the Greeks who have supported me with their love all these years and it is because of them that I find myself here at this moment.&quot;

Following the success of &quot;Gia&quot;, Despina released a CD single titled &quot;Ante Gia&quot; (Goodbye) in 2002, with the title track being a remix of &quot;Gia&quot;. The single achieved double platinum status. &quot;Gia&quot; and &quot;Ante Gia&quot; were then compiled and re-released as &quot;&quot;Gia &amp; Ante Gia: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;&quot;, along with four previously unreleased remixes.

===&quot;Live&quot;, International exposure and motherhood (2003–04)===
In 2003 the double album &quot;Despina Vandi Live&quot; was released, containing performances from the singers&#x27; concerts around Greece. The album included the greatest personal hits of her 9-year career in the Greek music industry (1994–2003), as long as many songs by other artists, covering a wide variety of genres (from rock-entehno to laïko and traditional Greek music). The album featured also two new songs: &quot;Fevgoume Kardia mou&quot; and &quot;O, ti Oneirevomoun&quot;. It was certified platinum, selling more than 60,000 copies.

In the meantime, with &quot;Gia&quot; having been certified multi-platinum in Greece and Cyprus, some of the songs broke out into the international market in neighboring countries. Seeing potential in an international career, she embarked on one in 2003.

Her first three international singles, &quot;Gia&quot; (2003), &quot;Opa Opa&quot; (2004) and &quot;Come Along Now&quot; (2005) entered the charts around the world. Her first internationally distributed albums are named after the songs &quot;Gia&quot; and &quot;Come Along Now&quot;. &quot;Gia&quot; and &quot;Opa Opa&quot; have both charted on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Airplay charts, with &quot;Gia&quot; reaching number 1 for two weeks on the latter and &quot;Opa Opa&quot; reaching number 3 on the Hot Dance Radio Airplay of &quot;Billboard&quot;. In addition to the Billboard Charts, &quot;Gia&quot; reached number 1 on the biggest radio stations in the US, WKTU, KKDL and WPYM. Also, &quot;Gia&quot; reached number 1 at the Club Charts of Music Week in Great Britain and became the number 1 dance song of the year in USA, Germany, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Italy, France, Spain, Turkey, Cyprus and Sweden. All three singles reached No. 1 on the Australian charts. The song &quot;Gia&quot; gave to her the award for the best dance artist for the year 2004 in Portugal and she makes a big concert for her European public. Except from &quot;Gia&quot;, and the song &quot;Opa Opa&quot; reaching number 1 in Russia, Turkey and Australia. In the first days of October 2004 Despina Vandi makes four big concerts in New York, Atlantic City, Chicago and Toronto. All these concerts was sold out

The song &quot;Come Along Now&quot; became the second best selling single in Russia and the biggest to audience radio station of Russia, Hit FM, awarded to her an honorary award in a special concert for her. Vandi also made an appearance on the hit international show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; where she performed her song &quot;Gia&quot; as she was included in some of that week&#x27;s best-selling popular music artists.

Vandi&#x27;s work has been remixed by celebrated global DJs and producers, such as Armand Van Helden, Milk &amp; Sugar, Nick Skitz, Roger Sanchez, Junior Vasquez, Pete Tong, Bass Bumpers, DJ Gregory, Level K, XTM, Minimal Chic and Highpass amongst others. The albums &quot;Gia&quot; and &quot;Opa Opa&quot; have also been &quot;Records of The Week&quot; on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s dance shows. At the end of August (2004) Despina performed live at the Beatstock Festival in New York.

===Comeback – &quot;Stin Avli tou paradeisou&quot; (2004–06)===

Vandi&#x27;s next studio album was released at the end of 2004, titled &quot;Stin Avli Tou Paradisou&quot; (In The Garden of Paradise). Although it sold significantly less than &quot;Gia&quot;, it reached double platinum status in 2005, becoming her fourth album to reach six figure sales

The album was repackaged as a special edition and included 5 new songs, including the song &quot;Amane&quot;, a duet with Giorgos Mazonakis. The actress Katiana Balanika guest stars in the song&#x27;s music video along with Vandi and Mazonakis. The special edition of the album was released in Greece, Cyprus, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. In Turkey the album reached number 2 of the Turkish charts and the Turkish newspaper &quot;Hurriyet Daily News&quot; named Despina Vandi as the Queen of Greek Pop. For the winter season 2005–06 Vandi performed at Rex with Giorgos Mazonakis. In July 2006, Despina gave a concert in the theater of Lycabettus in Athens singing many of her popular songs.

Despina Vandi released the CD single &quot;Kalanta&quot; (Carols) in Greece on 22 November 2006, which reached double platinum status after two weeks from the release of the CD single. The videoclip of &quot;Kalanta&quot; was released on 19 December, soon followed by the video of her next hit single, &quot;Mehri Mai Mina&quot; (Till The Month of May). Vandi and Mazonakis once again collaborated for the winter season 2006–07.

On 10 October 2007 (10/10) Vandi released her new single &quot;Thelo&quot; (I Want) simultaneously on all radio and TV stations across Greece at 10 am. It marked her 10-year anniversary of collaborating with Phoebus. The song reached the top of the Nielsen&#x27;s Radio Airplay chart for Greece for six consecutive weeks.

On 6 March 2008, Vandi released the third single from the album, titled &quot;Agapi&quot; (Love). The single was on the MAD TV Charts for six weeks with one week at number one. On 24 April 2008, the fourth single titled &quot;Fantasou Apla&quot; (Simply imagine) was released.

Vandi was featured on the gold-certified album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; by German electronica act Schiller, which was released in early 2008, providing vocals for the song &quot;Destiny&quot;, composed by Phoebus. She performed the track with Schiller on 17 June 2008 at the MAD Video Music Awards 2008, where she won the category of &quot;Best Female Artist&quot; and also performed &quot;I Gi Ki I Selini&quot; (Earth and Moon).

On 24 June 2008, the album &quot; Deka Hronia Mazi&quot; was repackaged with the title &quot;10 Hronia Mazi: It&#x27;s Destiny&quot;, including the song &quot;Destiny&quot; by Schiller featuring Despina Vandi.

Vandi was involved in the Global One music project. She attended a recording session in Beijing with Chinese pop star Wei-Wei and Brazilian samba singer Daniela Mercury, while also attending the project&#x27;s first official press conference. The project&#x27;s goal, driven by international record producer Rob Hoffman, was to have one artist representing their country &quot;Global One&quot; songs in their native language, as well as in the English language, in efforts to pool together as many languages and cultures as possible to promote their artistry on a global level.

In the end of 2008, Vandi began an international tour and on 10–12 October she performed three sold-out concerts in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. She later performed in charity concerts in Cyprus, where she was awarded the platinum award for her album 10 Hronia Mazi in Cyprus, after she had already received the platinum certification for the sales of the album in Greece. On 15–24 May 2009, she performed in a five venue tour of the United States and Canada. Following her tour in America, she collaborated with Goin&#x27; Through for a lengthy tour throughout Greece.

=== &quot;Iparhi Zoi&quot; (2009) &amp; move to &quot;The Spicy Effect&quot; ===
On 16 June, Vandi made a dynamic comeback, after a year&#x27;s absence, with the pop-rock song Iparhi Zoi (There&#x27;s still life). The song was written by Phoebus and it was presented on 24 June in the Mad Video Music Awards 2009. On 29 June, Despina gave the opening concert in Thessaloniki for the Long Hot Summer Tour. After 32 sold-out concerts the tour sold 150,000 tickets. With this tour Vandi broke the record for pre-sale tickets to the concert in the Olympia pre-selling 3,000 tickets. The tour was, also, the most successful tour of 2009.

Following the departure of her songwriter and collaborator Phoebus from Heaven Music, Vandi officially announced on 2 November 2009, that she also has chosen to leave Heaven Music and signed in with the record label founded by Phoebus, called &quot;The Spicy Effect&quot;.

On 11 December, Vandi returned to the Greek nightlife, singing at club Politia in Thessaloniki alongside Goin&#x27; Through. On 12 December, Heaven Music, released the compilation &quot;Despina Vandi – Greatest Hits 2001–2009&quot;. Vandi later performed at &quot;Thalassa People&#x27;s Stage&quot; with the group &quot;48 Ores&quot;. The show began on 15 April and lasted until July. Vandi later appeared on 14 March on &quot;Chart Show&quot;, a show broadcast by Alpha TV where her certifications and sales figures were chronicled, ranking her in the 4th position among Greek female singers in the phonographic era.

=== C&#x27;est La Vie (2010) ===
In 2010 Vandi presented her new song, &quot;Koritsi Prama&quot;, exclusively for the listeners who wοn VIP invitations from Dromos 89.8 FM radio. &quot;Koritsi Prama, Part 1&quot;, was released on 22 March and was the lead single from her eighth studio album, &quot;C&#x27; est la vie&quot;. The pop song written by Phoebus was the first release coordinated by The Spicy Effect label. The music video was filmed on 22 March at &quot;Diogenis Studio&quot;. The song was the first half of a two-part work Vandi released &quot;Koritsi Prama, Part 2&quot;, two months later, on 14 May 2010.

The new album of Despina Vandi, called &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot;, was released on 13 June with &quot;Real News&quot; newspaper. It was her first album to be released along with a newspaper, following a popular tendency of the Greek musical industry, as an effort to deal with the reduction in the disc sales. The newspaper, along with the album, sold more than 100,000 copies. On the other hand, this release choice resulted in the album receiving no official certification of gold sales, for the first time for a Vandi album after her early releases at the first half of the 1990s. On 14 June, Vandi performed live at the MAD Video Music Awards, presenting her new song &quot;Kommati Ap&#x27; Tin Kardia Sou&quot;. The song was also the following single of the album &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot; and was released on 7 June 2010. The video clip was released on 5 July 2010 and made positive impressions, revealing a &quot;rock side&quot; of Vandi. The third single of the album, &quot;Erota Theli I Zoi&quot;, was released to radio stations on 13 September 2010. The music video, filmed on the Greek island of Hydra, was uploaded on 19 October 2010 on Spicy&#x27;s YouTube Channel.

Furthermore, the German band Schiller, who had worked with Vandi in the past, released a new song featuring her as vocals, called &quot;Sunday&quot; and included it in their album &quot;Breathless&quot;, the international version of Schiller&#x27;s album &quot;Atemlos&quot;. The song was also included in the album &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot;.

Vandi was also the first artist who took part in the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert series of the music channel MTV Greece. The concert took place in the theater &quot;Hora&quot; in Kypseli on 9 June. She later went on a tour around Greece, along with Elli Kokkinou. After the successful concerts all over the Greece, Vandi performed live on 31 October at HMV Forum of London. It was the first time for Vandi in London and it was also a sold out. After the concert, she appeared at the music scene VOX and after five months, the show finished on 6 March. On 14 June 2011 Despina Vandi appeared on Mad Video Music Awards 2011 and performed the song &quot;Gi&#x27; Alli Mia Fora&quot; (For one more time).

=== Allaxa (2012) === 
In November 2011 a digital single was released by Vandi called &quot;Mou &#x27;His Perasi&quot;, as a promo to Despina&#x27;s forthcoming album. The music was written by Gavrilis Mosas and the lyrics by Phoebus. The video clip, filmed in the area of the Messolonghi lagoon was also released the same month. The song&#x27;s release was followed by another digital single taken from her 9th studio album, called Girismata. On late 2011 Vandi&#x27;s appearances began at the nightclub FEVER along with Elli Kokkinou and Nikos Ikonomopoulos.

On 2012 the album &quot;Allaxa&quot; was released, marking Vandi&#x27;s return to a more laïko genre after the poorly received C&#x27; est la vie&quot; album. Apart from Phoebus there is a collaboration with songwriters such as Eleni Giannatsoulia, Olga Vlahopoulou, Vangelis Kostantinidis and Gavrilis Mosas. The album was certified double-platinum sales and re-established Vandi&#x27;s commercial success with multiple hits such as: &quot;Mou &#x27;His Perasi&quot;, &quot;Girismata&quot;, &quot;To asteri mou&quot;, &quot;To nisi&quot; (its videoclip was filmed in the island of Skiathos) and &quot;Katalavaino&quot;.

=== Eurovision TV presenter – The Voice – De Me Stamatises (2013–14) ===

Despina has been offered many times to represent Greece in Eurovision song contest but she never accepted. On 15 January 2013 the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) announced that it had reached an agreement with private music channel MAD TV to take on the organisation and production of a national final to select a song to represent Greece in the contest. Despina Vandi was selected to host the event along with actor Giorgos Kapoutzidis. It was the first time that a well-known singer hosted such an event. The following year, Vandi and Kapoutzidis hosted again the event, called &quot;Eurosong 2014: a MAD Show&quot;.

In 2013–2014 Vandi was one of the four artists/coaches participating in the Greek version of The Voice, along with Antonis Remos, Melina Aslanidou and Michalis Kouinelis. The winner of the show&#x27;s first season, Maria Elena Kyriakou, was on Vandi&#x27;s team.

On the meantime Despina&#x27;s digital single &quot;Hano Esena&quot; produced by Dimitris Kontopoulos was released on 2013, receiving positive reviews and remaining 10 weeks at the top of the airplay chart.

In December 2014 Vandi released her new album &#x27;De Me Stamatises&#x27; (including 10 tracks). It was the first album since 1997, in which none of the songs was written by her long-time producer Phoebus. Instead, she collaborated again with various songwriters, among them: Dimitris Kontopoulos, Eleni Giannatsoulia, Olga Vlahopoulou, Giorgos Sampanis, Nikos Moraitis and Vasilis Gavriilidis. The first three new singles &quot;Kalimera&quot;, &quot;Ola allazoun&quot; and &quot;Kane kati&quot;, were released right after her return to Heaven Music.

Inspired by the musical, she released the album &quot;To Diko Mou Cinema&quot; (2019), including covers of notable songs from popular Greek films produced in the 1960s and 1970s.

In 2019, she produced and presented the travel show &quot;My Greece&quot;. Vandi visits a variety of Greek towns and villages showcasing their traditions, culture, local food, and history.
&quot;My Greece&quot; is currently in its third season.

As of October 2022, she was a member of Barking Well Media, founded by Nikos Koklonis, where she hosted a variety of shows, including &quot;Chart Show&quot;, &quot;Just the 2 of Us&quot;, &quot;The X Factor&quot;, and &quot;My Greece&quot;.

In 2024, she collaborated with rap artist Mente Fuerte, and together they reached No. 1 on the Official IFPI Airplay Chart by Media Inspector with the song &quot;Panselinos.&quot; The track also achieved significant success in the digital domain, becoming double platinum in digital sales.

==Personal life==
Although born in Germany, Vandi&#x27;s family was from Kavala, Greece, where she and her family moved when she was six years old. As a result, she did not learn German, unlike the rest of her family. She has one older brother and an older sister. Living in a lower-middle-class family, her dream was to become either an actress or a singer but she always knew that she should have something more solid as a background so she went on to study psychology, philosophy, and education at the University of Thessaloniki. When she first began singing, she used the stage name of &quot;Elli Mara&quot; before adopting the &quot;Vandi&quot; moniker, to hide that she was singing from her parents.

From 2003 to 2021, Vandi was married to Demis Nikolaidis, ex-international soccer player and former president of AEK. They have two children: a daughter Melina (born February 2004) and a son Giorgos (born August 2007).

Since 2021, Vandi has been in a relationship with Greek actor .

On 18 August 2008, Vandi was in a car accident on Kifissias Avenue in Kifissia, Greece. The car she was in, driven by her chauffeur, slipped on an oil slick that leaked from a tanker truck causing the car to crash into the truck ahead of her. After drivers helped pull her out of the vehicle, she was transported by ambulance to the general hospital in Athens. Vandi only suffered a cut to her head and got stitches.

<text>Korabl-Sputnik 3 ( meaning &quot;Ship-Satellite 3&quot;) or Vostok-1K No.3, also known as Sputnik 6 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft which was launched in 1960. It was a test flight of the Vostok spacecraft, carrying two dogs; Pcholka and Mushka (&quot;little bee&quot; and &quot;little fly&quot;; affectionate diminutives of &quot;pchela&quot; and &quot;mukha&quot;, respectively), Mice, rats, plants, rabbits, and flies, as well as a television camera and scientific instruments.

Soviet space plans for the next several months were ambitious and included Vostok missions, planetary probes, military reconnaissance, and scientific satellites but the first were given priority. However, the Mars shots ended up going first in October and only after those missions flew could the next Vostok test took place. There was still wrangling over the exact design of the Vostok ejector seat and it was eventually decided to eject the cosmonaut at a relatively low altitude instead of an enclosed capsule like had been originally envisioned. There was also the possibility that the Vostok&#x27;s retrorocket could fail and leave the cosmonaut stuck in orbit. It was too late in the spacecraft&#x27;s design phase to add a backup retrorocket but it could be solved by putting the Vostok into a low enough orbit that it would decay in ten days; the spacecraft had enough consumables onboard to last that long.

Korabl-Sputnik 3 was launched at 07:30:04 UTC on 1 December 1960, atop a Vostok-L carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was successfully placed into low Earth orbit and Western observers quickly noticed that the orbit was lower than the previous Vostok test flights. All spacecraft systems functioned normally right up until reentry. On the 17th orbit, ground controllers issued the commands to perform the deorbit burn. The retrorocket activated but the capsule did not separate from the instrument module. The APO self-destruct system then activated followed by total loss of data. It was obvious that something went very wrong and the spacecraft had been destroyed, but it would take a while to figure out what it was.

Analysis of telemetry data confirmed a malfunction of the infrared orientation sensor. The attitude control jets maneuvered Korabl-Sputnik 3 into the wrong orientation for reentry, resulting in an unpredictable landing point--Boris Chertok calculated that it would land somewhere in China. The flight control system missed the required time marker for the atmospheric entry measured by a G-force sensor, activating the APO and blowing the descent module to pieces. Both Pchyolka and Mushka were killed in the resulting disintegration. They were the last dogs to die in a Soviet space mission, after Laika, who was never intended to survive her Sputnik 2 flight, and Chaika and Lisichka, perishing after the rocket carrying their &quot;Korabl Sputnik&quot; spacecraft disintegrated 20 seconds into the flight. An official TASS announcement confirmed that Korabl-Sputnik 3 had been destroyed upon reentry.

The backup Vostok spacecraft and booster were erected on LC-1 and on 22 December, the dogs Damka and Krasavka lifted off. All went well though the core stage burn. At T+304 seconds, a command was issued to the Blok E stage to begin pressurizing the fuel feed system for engine start. However, telemetry indicated that the command was never received. The Blok E engine activated at T+321 seconds but cut off after 111 seconds of operation instead of the intended 355 seconds and orbital velocity could not be attained. Sensing the loss of acceleration from the Blok E, the spacecraft system issued the normal command to separate from the rocket stage. It began to fall back to Earth and the increasing heat of reentry triggered the separation sequence between the instrument and descent modules.

The descent module was tracked to a reentry point somewhere in north central Siberia some 3,000 kilometers (1,868 miles) downrange from the Baikonur launch complex. Engineer Fedor Vostokov was assigned to lead the recovery team due to his expertise in designing the cabin that housed the dogs. He met with a military explosives expert and they boarded an Il-18 aircraft and picked up a search and rescue team in Krasnoyarsk. The explosives expert was needed to disarm the potentially still live APO system in the capsule. An aerial search near Tura on December 23 failed to find any sign of the capsule but another attempt the next morning found that it had landed in a snow bank on a plateau, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Tura.

The rescue team waded through deep snow and frigid temperatures, below -30C, to the capsule. The cabin was still inside but the ejector mechanism had launched itself without taking the cabin with it for reasons unknown but possibly due to high G-loads during descent. The explosives expert quickly disconnected the wires for the APO system. Upon opening the GKZh container, Damka and Krasavka were found shivering but alive despite two days of being trapped in there. The other biological specimens had died as they were unable to handle the cold. The landing spot was at a latitude of 64N and there were less than 4 hours of daylight at this time of year so the rescue team had to get the capsule out of there before dark. An Mi-4 helicopter extracted the capsule but could barely handle its two ton bulk. It had to fly the capsule 600 kilometers (372 miles) to Turukhansk to be picked up by an An-12 transport aircraft (the An-12 could not land near Tura due to the lack of a suitable runway there).

Postflight analysis found that the Blok E stage&#x27;s gas generator had failed at T+425 seconds and resulted in premature engine shutdown. The flight also resulted in a redesign of the ejector seat to ensure it would work properly on manned missions. As the dogs had otherwise been successfully recovered, Korolev believed the Soviet state media should acknowledge the aborted launch but Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev refused as he was unwilling to publicly admit to two unsuccessful missions in a row. The flight was not officially admitted to until the glasnost era of the late 1980s.

<text>SMS was the second of two s of the Imperial German Navy, launched in 1911 and named after the German Franco-Prussian War veteran General August Karl von Goeben. Along with her sister ship, was similar to the previous German battlecruiser design, , but larger, with increased armor protection and two more main guns in an additional turret. and were significantly larger and better armored than the comparable British .

Several months after her commissioning in 1912, , with the light cruiser , formed the German Mediterranean Division and patrolled there during the Balkan Wars. After the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, and bombarded French positions in North Africa and then evaded British naval forces in the Mediterranean and reached Constantinople. The two ships were transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 16 August 1914, and became the flagship of the Ottoman Navy as &#x27;, usually shortened to &#x27;. By bombarding Russian facilities in the Black Sea, she brought Turkey into World War I on the German side. The ship operated primarily against Russian forces in the Black Sea during the war, including several inconclusive engagements with Russian battleships. She made a sortie into the Aegean in January 1918 that resulted in the Battle of Imbros, where sank a pair of British monitors but was herself badly damaged by mines.

In 1936 she was officially renamed TCG (&quot;Ship of the Turkish Republic &quot;); she carried the remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit in 1938. remained the flagship of the Turkish Navy until she was decommissioned in 1950. She was scrapped in 1973, after the West German government declined an invitation to buy her back from Turkey. She was the last surviving ship built by the Imperial German Navy, and the longest-serving dreadnought-type ship in any navy.

== Design ==

As the German (Imperial Navy) continued in its arms race with the British Royal Navy in 1907, the (Imperial Navy Office) considered plans for the battlecruiser that was to be built for the following year. An increase in the budget raised the possibility of increasing the caliber of the main battery from the guns used in the previous battlecruiser, , to , but Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Navy, opposed the increase, preferring to add a pair of 28 cm guns instead. The Construction Department supported the change, and ultimately two ships were authorized for the 1908 and 1909 building years; was the first, followed by .

 was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of fully loaded. The ship displaced normally, and at full load. was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by twenty-four coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of , though she exceeded this speed significantly on her trials. At , the ship had a range of . Her crew consisted of 43 officers and 1,010 enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten SK L/50 guns mounted in five twin-gun turrets; of these, one was placed forward, two were &quot;en echelon&quot; amidships, and the other two were in a superfiring pair aft. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve SK L/45 guns placed in individual casemates in the central portion of the ship. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve SK L/45 guns, also in individual mounts in the bow, the stern, and around the forward conning tower. She was also equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one in the stern, and one on each broadside.

The ship&#x27;s armor consisted of Krupp cemented steel. The belt was thick in the citadel where it covered the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. The belt tapered down to on either end. The deck was thick, sloping downward at the side to connect to the bottom edge of the belt. The main battery gun turrets had faces, and they sat atop barbettes that were equally thick.

==Service history ==

The Imperial Navy ordered , the third German battlecruiser, on 8 April 1909 under the provisional name &quot;H&quot; from the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg, under construction number 201. Her keel was laid on 19 August; the hull was completed and the ship was launched on 28 March 1911. Fitting-out work followed, and she was commissioned into the German Navy on 2 July 1912.

When the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912, the German General Staff determined that a naval Mediterranean Division () was needed to project German power in the Mediterranean, and thus dispatched and the light cruiser to Constantinople. The two ships left Kiel on 4 November and arrived on 15 November 1912. Beginning in April 1913, visited many Mediterranean ports including Venice, Pola, and Naples, before sailing into Albanian waters. Following this trip, returned to Pola and remained there from 21 August to 16 October for maintenance.

On 29 June 1913, the Second Balkan War broke out and the Mediterranean Division was retained in the area. On 23 October 1913, (Rear Admiral) Wilhelm Souchon assumed command of the squadron. and continued their activities in the Mediterranean, and visited some 80 ports before the outbreak of World War I. The navy made plans to replace with her sister , but the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on 28 June 1914 and the subsequent rise in tensions between the Great Powers made this impossible. After the assassination, Souchon assessed that war was imminent between the Central Powers and the Triple Entente, and ordered his ships to make for Pola for repairs. Engineers came from Germany to work on the ship. had 4,460 boiler tubes replaced, among other repairs. Upon completion, the ships departed for Messina.

=== World War I ===
==== Pursuit of and ====
Kaiser Wilhelm II had ordered that in the event of war, and should either conduct raids in the western Mediterranean to prevent the return of French troops from North Africa to Europe, or break out into the Atlantic and attempt to return to German waters, on the squadron commander&#x27;s discretion. On 3 August 1914, the two ships were en route to Algeria when Souchon received word of the declaration of war against France. bombarded Philippeville, French Algeria, for about 10 minutes early on 3 August while shelled nearby Bône, in accordance with the Kaiser&#x27;s order. Tirpitz and Admiral Hugo von Pohl then transmitted secret orders to Souchon instructing him to sail to Constantinople, in direct contravention of the Kaiser&#x27;s instructions and without his knowledge.

Since could not reach Constantinople without coaling, Souchon headed for Messina. The Germans encountered the British battlecruisers and , but Germany was not yet at war with Britain and neither side opened fire. The British turned to follow and , but the German ships were able to outrun the British, and arrived in Messina by 5 August. Refueling in Messina was complicated by the declaration of Italian neutrality on 2 August. Under international law, combatant ships were permitted only 24 hours in a neutral port. Sympathetic Italian naval authorities in the port allowed and to remain in port for around 36 hours while the ships coaled from a German collier. Despite the additional time, ″s fuel stocks were not sufficient to permit the voyage to Constantinople, so Souchon arranged to rendezvous with another collier in the Aegean Sea. The French fleet remained in the western Mediterranean, since the French naval commander in the Mediterranean, Admiral Lapeyrère, was convinced the Germans would either attempt to escape to the Atlantic or join the Austrians in Pola.
Souchon&#x27;s two ships departed Messina early on 6 August through the southern entrance to the strait and headed for the eastern Mediterranean. The two British battlecruisers were 100 miles away, while a third, , was coaling in Bizerta, Tunisia. The only British naval force in Souchon&#x27;s way was the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which consisted of the four armored cruisers , , and under the command of Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge. The Germans headed initially towards the Adriatic in a feint; the move misled Troubridge, who sailed to intercept them in the mouth of the Adriatic. After realizing his mistake, Troubridge reversed course and ordered the light cruiser and two destroyers to launch a torpedo attack on the Germans. ″s lookouts spotted the ships, and in the darkness, she and evaded their pursuers undetected. Troubridge broke off the chase early on 7 August, convinced that any attack by his four older armored cruisers against —armed with her larger 28 cm guns—would be suicidal. Souchon&#x27;s journey to Constantinople was now clear.

 refilled her coal bunkers off the island of Donoussa near Naxos. During the afternoon of 10 August, the two ships entered the Dardanelles. They were met by an Ottoman picket boat, which guided them through to the Sea of Marmara. To circumvent neutrality requirements, the Ottoman government proposed that the ships be transferred to its ownership &quot;by means of a fictitious sale.&quot; Before the Germans could approve this, the Ottomans announced on 11 August that they had purchased the ships for 80 million Marks. In a formal ceremony the two ships were commissioned in the Ottoman Navy on 16 August. On 23 September, Souchon accepted an offer to command the Turkish fleet. was renamed and was renamed ; their German crews donned Ottoman uniforms and fezzes.

==== Black Sea operations ====

===== 1914 =====
On 29 October bombarded Sevastopol in her first operation against Imperial Russia, though the Ottoman Empire was not yet at war with the Entente; Souchon conducted the operation to force Turkey into the war on the side of Germany. A shell struck the ship in the after funnel, but it failed to detonate and did negligible damage. Two other hits inflicted minor damage. The ship and her escorts passed through an inactive Russian minefield during the bombardment. As she returned to Turkish waters, came across the Russian minelayer which scuttled herself with 700 mines on board. During the engagement the escorting Russian destroyer was damaged by two of ″s secondary battery shells. In response to the bombardment, Russia declared war on 1 November, thus forcing the Ottomans into the wider world war. France and Great Britain bombarded the Turkish fortresses guarding the Dardanelles on 3 November and formally declared war two days later. From this engagement, the Russians drew the conclusion that the entire Black Sea Fleet would have to remain consolidated so it could not be defeated in detail (one ship at a time) by .

, escorted by , intercepted the Russian Black Sea Fleet off the Crimean coastline on 18 November as it returned from a bombardment of Trebizond. Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy and none of the capital ships were spotted initially. The Black Sea Fleet had experimented with concentrating fire from several ships under the control of one &quot;master&quot; ship before the war, and held her fire until , the master ship, could see . When the gunnery commands were finally received they showed a range over in excess of ″s own estimate of , so opened fire using her own data before turned to fire her broadside. She scored a hit with her first salvo as a 12-inch shell partially penetrated the armor casemate protecting one of ″s secondary guns. It detonated some of the ready-use ammunition, starting a fire that filled the casemate and killed the entire gun crew. A total of thirteen men were killed and three were wounded.

 returned fire and hit in the middle funnel; the shell detonated after it passed through the funnel and destroyed the antennae for the fire-control radio, so that could not correct ″s inaccurate range data. The other Russian ships either used ″s incorrect data or never saw and failed to register any hits. hit four more times, although one shell failed to detonate, before Souchon decided to break contact after 14 minutes of combat. The four hits out of nineteen shells fired killed 34 men and wounded 24.

The following month, on 5–6 December, and provided protection for troop transports, and on 10 December, bombarded Batum. On 23 December, and the protected cruiser escorted three transports to Trebizond. While returning from another transport escort operation on 26 December, struck a mine that exploded beneath the conning tower, on the starboard side, about one nautical mile outside the Bosphorus. The explosion tore a hole in the ship&#x27;s hull, but the torpedo bulkhead held. Two minutes later, struck a second mine on the port side, just forward of the main battery wing barbette; this tore open a hole. The bulkhead bowed in but retained watertight protection of the ship&#x27;s interior. However, some 600 tons of water flooded the ship. There was no dock in the Ottoman Empire large enough to service , so temporary repairs were effected inside steel cofferdams, which were pumped out to create a dry work area around the damaged hull. The holes were patched with concrete, which held for several years before more permanent work was necessary.

===== 1915 =====
Still damaged, sortied from the Bosphorus on 28 January and again on 7 February 1915 to help escape the Russian fleet; she also covered the return of . then underwent repair work to the mine damage until May. On 1 April, with repairs incomplete, left the Bosphorus in company with to cover the withdrawal of and the protected cruiser , which had been sent to bombard Odessa. Strong currents, however, forced the cruisers east to the approaches of the Dnieper-Bug Liman (bay) that led to Nikolayev. As they sailed west after a course correction, struck a mine and sank, so this attack had to be aborted. After and appeared off Sevastopol and sank two cargo steamers, the Russian fleet chased them all day, and detached several destroyers after dusk to attempt a torpedo attack. Only one destroyer, , was able to close the distance and launch an attack, which missed. and returned to the Bosphorus unharmed.
On 25 April, the same day the Allies landed at Gallipoli, Russian naval forces arrived off the Bosphorus and bombarded the forts guarding the strait. Two days later headed south to the Dardanelles to bombard Allied troops at Gallipoli, accompanied by the pre-dreadnought battleship . They were spotted at dawn from a kite balloon as they were getting into position. When the first round from the dreadnought landed close by, moved out of firing position, close to the cliffs, where &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; could not engage her. On 30 April tried again, but was spotted from the pre-dreadnought which had moved into the Dardanelles to bombard the Turkish headquarters at Çanakkale. The British ship only managed to fire five rounds before moved out of her line of sight.

On 1 May, sailed to the Bay of Beikos in the Bosphorus after the Russian fleet bombarded the fortifications at the mouth of the Bosphorus. Around 7 May, sortied from the Bosphorus in search of Russian ships as far as Sevastopol, but found none. Running short on main gun ammunition, she did not bombard Sevastopol. While returning on the morning of 10 May, ″s lookouts spotted two Russian pre-dreadnoughts, and , and she opened fire. Within the first ten minutes she had been hit twice, although she was not seriously damaged. Admiral Souchon disengaged and headed for the Bosphorus, pursued by Russian light forces. Later that month two of the ship&#x27;s 15 cm guns were taken ashore for use there, and the four 8.8 cm guns in the aft superstructure were removed at the same time. Four 8.8 cm anti-aircraft were installed on the aft superstructure by the end of 1915.

On 18 July, struck a mine; the ship took on some of water and was no longer able to escort coal convoys from Zonguldak to the Bosphorus. was assigned to the task, and on 10 August she escorted a convoy of five coal transports, along with and three torpedo boats. During transit, the convoy was attacked by the Russian submarine , which sank one of the colliers. The following day, and another submarine tried to attack as well, though they were unable to reach a firing position. Two Russian destroyers, and , attacked a Turkish convoy escorted by and two torpedo boats on 5 September. ″s guns broke down during combat, and the Turks summoned , but she arrived too late: the Turkish colliers had already been beached to avoid capture by the Russian destroyers.

On 21 September, was again sent out of the Bosphorus to drive off three Russian destroyers which had been attacking Turkish coal ships. Escort missions continued until 14 November, when the submarine nearly hit with two torpedoes just outside the Bosphorus. Admiral Souchon decided the risk to the battlecruiser was too great, and suspended the convoy system. In its stead, only those ships fast enough to make the journey from Zonguldak to Constantinople in a single night were permitted; outside the Bosphorus they would be met by torpedo boats to defend them against the lurking submarines. By the end of the summer, the completion of two new Russian dreadnought battleships, and , further curtailed ″s activities.

===== 1916–1917 =====

Admiral Souchon sent to Zonguldak on 8 January to protect an approaching empty collier from Russian destroyers in the area, but the Russians sank the transport ship before arrived. On the return trip to the Bosphorus, encountered . The two ships engaged in a brief artillery duel, beginning at a range of 18,500 meters. turned to the southwest, and in the first four minutes of the engagement, fired five salvos from her main guns. Neither ship scored any hits, though shell splinters from near misses struck . This was the only battle between dreadnoughts on the Black Sea to ever occur. Though nominally much faster than , the Turkish battlecruiser&#x27;s bottom was badly fouled and her propeller shafts were in poor condition. This made it difficult for to escape from the powerful Russian battleship, which was reported to have reached .

Russian forces were making significant gains into Ottoman territory during the Caucasus Campaign. In an attempt to prevent further advances by the Russian army, rushed 429 officers and men, a mountain artillery battery, machine gun and aviation units, 1,000 rifles, and 300 cases of munitions to Trebizond on 4 February. On 4 March, the Russian navy landed a detachment of some 2,100 men, along with mountain guns and horses, on either side of the port of Atina. The Turks were caught by surprise and forced to evacuate. Another landing took place at Kavata Bay, some 5 miles east of Trebizond, in June. In late June, the Turks counterattacked and penetrated around 20 miles into the Russian lines. and conducted a series of coastal operations to support the Turkish attacks. On 4 July, shelled the port of Tuapse, where she sank a steamer and a motor schooner. The Turkish ships sailed northward to circle back behind the Russians before the two Russian dreadnoughts left Sevastopol to try to attack them. They then returned to the Bosphorus, where was docked for repairs to her propeller shafts until September.

The coal shortage continued to worsen until Admiral Souchon was forced to suspend operations by and through 1917. Early on 10 July 1917, a Royal Naval Air Service Handley Page Type O bomber, flying from Moudros, Greece, tried to bomb from with eight bombs. It missed but instead sank the destroyer , the largest ship sunk by air during the First World War. After an armistice between Russia and the Ottoman Empire was signed in December 1917 following the Bolshevik revolution, formalized in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, coal started to arrive again from eastern Turkey.

===== 1918 =====
On 20 January 1918, and left the Dardanelles under the command of Vice Admiral Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz, who had replaced Souchon the previous September. Rebeur-Paschwitz&#x27;s intention was to draw Allied naval forces away from Palestine in support of Turkish forces there. Outside the straits, in the course of what became known as the Battle of Imbros, surprised and sank the monitors and which were at anchor and unsupported by the pre-dreadnoughts that should have been guarding them. Rebeur-Paschwitz then decided to proceed to the port of Mudros; there the British pre-dreadnought battleship was raising steam to attack the Turkish ships. While en route, struck several mines and sank; hit three mines as well. Retreating to the Dardanelles and pursued by the British destroyers and , she was intentionally beached near Nagara Point just outside the Dardanelles. The British attacked with bombers from No. 2 Wing of the Royal Naval Air Service while she was grounded and hit her twice, but the bombs from the light aircraft were not heavy enough to do any serious damage. The monitor attempted to shell on the evening of 24 January, but only managed to fire ten rounds before withdrawing to escape the Turkish artillery fire. The submarine was sent to destroy the damaged ship, but was too late; the old ex-German pre-dreadnought had towed off and returned her to the safety of Constantinople. was crippled by the extensive damage; cofferdams were again built around the hull, and repairs lasted from 7 August to 19 October.

Before the repair work was carried out, escorted the members of the Ottoman Armistice Commission to Odessa on 30 March 1918, after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. After returning to Constantinople she sailed in May to Sevastopol where she had her hull cleaned and some leaks repaired. and several destroyers sailed for Novorossiysk on 28 June to intern the remaining Soviet warships, but they had already been scuttled when the Turkish ships arrived. The destroyers remained, but returned to Sevastopol. On 14 July the ship was laid up for the rest of the war. While in Sevastopol, dockyard workers scraped fouling from the ship&#x27;s bottom. subsequently returned to Constantinople, where from 7 August to 19 October a concrete cofferdam was installed to repair one of the three areas damaged by mines.

The German navy formally transferred ownership of the vessel to the Turkish government on 2 November. According to the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres between the Ottoman Empire and the Western Allies, was to have been handed over to the Royal Navy as war reparations, but this was not done due to the Turkish War of Independence, which broke out immediately after World War I ended, as Greece attempted to seize territory from the crumbling Ottoman Empire. After modern Turkey emerged from the war victorious, the Treaty of Sèvres was discarded and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in its place in 1923. Under this treaty, the new Turkish republic retained possession of much of its fleet, including .

=== Post-war service ===
During the 1920s, a commitment to refurbish as the centerpiece of the new country&#x27;s fleet was the only constant element of the various naval policies which were put forward. The battlecruiser remained in İzmit until 1926, in a neglected state: only two of her boilers worked, she could not steer or steam, and she still had two unrepaired scars from the mine damage in 1918. Enough money was raised to allow the purchase of a new floating dock from Germany, as could not be towed anywhere without risk of her sinking in rough seas. The French company Atelier et Chantiers de St. Nazaire-Penhöet was contracted in December 1926 to oversee the subsequent refit, which was carried out by the Gölcük Naval Shipyard. Work proceeded over three years (1927–1930); it was delayed when several compartments of the dock collapsed while being pumped out. was slightly damaged before she could be refloated and the dock had to be repaired before the repair work could begin. The Minister of Marine, Ihsan Bey (İhsan Eryavuz), was convicted of embezzlement in the resulting investigation. 

Other delays were caused by fraud charges which resulted in the abolition of the Ministry of Marine. The Turkish Military&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Marshal Fevzi, opposed naval construction and slowed down all naval building programs following the fraud charges. Intensive work on the battlecruiser only began after the Greek Navy conducted a large-scale naval exercise off Turkey in September 1928 and the Turkish Government perceived a need to counter Greece&#x27;s naval superiority. The Turks also ordered four destroyers and two submarines from Italian shipyards. The Greek Government proposed a 10-year &quot;holiday&quot; from naval building modeled on the Washington Treaty when it learned that was to be brought back into service, though it reserved the right to build two new cruisers. The Turkish Government rejected this proposal, and claimed that the ship was intended to counter the growing strength of the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea.

Over the course of the refit, the mine damage was repaired, her displacement was increased to , and the hull was slightly reworked. She was reduced in length by a half meter but her beam increased by . was equipped with new boilers and a French fire control system for her main battery guns. Two of the 15 cm guns were removed from their casemate positions. Her armor protection was not upgraded to take the lessons of the Battle of Jutland into account, and she had only of armor above her magazines. was recommissioned in 1930, resuming her role as flagship of the Turkish Navy, and performed better than expected in her speed trials; her subsequent gunnery and fire control trials were also successful. The four destroyers, which were needed to protect the battlecruiser, entered service between 1931 and 1932; their performance never met the design specifications. In response to ″s return to service, the Soviet Union transferred the battleship and light cruiser from the Baltic in late 1929 to ensure that the Black Sea Fleet retained parity with the Turkish Navy. The Greek Government also responded by ordering two destroyers.

In 1933, she took Prime Minister İsmet İnönü from Varna to Istanbul and carried the Shah of Iran from Trebizond to Samsun the following year. had her name officially shortened to in 1930 and then to in 1936. Another short refit was conducted in 1938, and in November that year she carried the remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit. She and the other ships of the navy were considered outdated by the British Naval Attache by 1937, partly due to their substandard anti-aircraft armament, but in 1938 the Turkish government began planning to expand the force. Under these plans the surface fleet was to comprise two 10,000-ton cruisers and twelve destroyers. would be retained until the second cruiser was commissioned in 1945, and the navy expected to build a 23,000-ton ship between 1950 and 1960. The naval building program did not come about, as the foreign shipyards which were to build the ships concentrated on the needs of their own nations leading up to World War II.

 remained in service throughout World War II, but Turkey remained neutral during the conflict. was kept at Gölcük, defended by torpedo nets and reinforced anti-aircraft units. The ship had her main mast removed to make it more difficult to determine her course. In November 1939 she and were the only capital ships in the Black Sea region, and &quot;Life&quot; magazine reported that was superior to the Soviet ship because the latter was in poor condition. In 1941, her anti-aircraft battery was strengthened to four guns, ten guns, and four guns. These were later increased to twenty-two 40 mm guns and twenty-four 20 mm guns. Degaussing equipment was installed aboard the ship (and several other Turkish warships) in 1943 to protect them against magnetic mines.

On 5 April 1946, the American battleship , light cruiser , and destroyer arrived in Istanbul to return the remains of Turkish ambassador Münir Ertegün. greeted the ships in the Bosphorus, where she and &quot;Missouri&quot; exchanged 19-gun salutes. After 1948, the ship was stationed in either İzmit or Gölcük. The ship continued to participate in the annual fleet maneuvers that were held every September until 1950. She was decommissioned from active service on 20 December 1950 and stricken from the Navy register on 14 November 1954. When Turkey joined NATO in 1952, the ship was assigned the hull number B70. Though the ship had been removed from the naval register, she continued to be used as a stationary headquarters of the Battle Fleet Command and the Mine Fleet Command until 1960.

The Turkish government offered to sell the ship to the West German government in 1963 as a museum ship, but the offer was declined. Unable to afford the cost of preserving the ship itself, Turkey sold the ship to M.K.E. Seyman in 1971 for scrapping. She was towed to the breakers on 7 June 1973, and the work was completed in February 1976. By the time of her disposal she was the last dreadnought in existence outside the United States. She was the last surviving ship built by the Imperial German Navy, and the longest-serving dreadnought-type ship in any navy. Several parts of the ship have been preserved, including three of her screws (which were sent to the Naval Command and to the Istanbul Naval Museum) and her foremast (which was placed at the naval academy).

<text>AnandTech was an online computer hardware magazine owned by Future plc. It was founded in April 1997 by then-14-year-old Anand Lal Shimpi, who was CEO and editor-in-chief until August 2014, with Ryan Smith replacing him as editor-in-chief. The website was a source of hardware reviews for off-the-shelf components and exhaustive benchmarking, targeted towards computer-building enthusiasts, but later expanded to cover mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

Some of their articles on mass-market products such as mobile phones were syndicated by CNNMoney. The large accompanying forum is recommended by some books for bargain hunting in the technology field. AnandTech was acquired by Purch on 17 December 2014. Purch was acquired by Future in 2018.

On August 30, 2024, the publication shut down. The content of the website was said to be preserved, but no new articles or reviews would be published. The AnandTech forums would continue to operate.

== History ==
In its early stages, Matthew Witheiler was co-owner and Senior Hardware Editor, creating insightful and in-depth reviews for the site. 

In 2006, an AnandTech editor launched a spin-off called &quot;DailyTech&quot;, a technology news site. The move followed a similar evolution of the news section of AnandTech&#x27;s peer publication, Tom&#x27;s Guide, into TG Daily some months earlier.

On December 17, 2014, Purch announced the acquisition of Anandtech.com.

In 2018, Anandtech and other Purch consumer brands were sold to Future.

The editorial team also included Senior Editor Ian Cutress (who departed in February 2022), as well as Motherboard expert Gavin Bonshor. In January 2023, Gavin Bonshor was promoted to the Senior Editor position, effectively replacing Dr. Ian Cutress, the previous Senior Editor.

On August 30, 2024, AnandTech announced that it had ended publication effective immediately. The site will remain online as an archive, while its community forum will remain operational.

==Reviews==
Describing AnandTech in 2008, author Paul McFedries wrote that &quot;its heart and its claim to fame is the massive collection of incredibly in-depth reviews&quot;. In 2008, blogging expert Bruce C. Brown called AnandTech one of the &quot;big dogs in the tech field&quot;. In 2005, computer expert Leo Laporte described AnandTech as an &quot;outstanding review and technology website for 3D hardware and other computer components&quot; and said that it is &quot;one of the most professional hardware review sites online&quot;.

== Forums ==
AnandTech has over 350,000 registered users and over 35 million posts. The AnandTech forums are home to distributive computing teams, known collectively as TeAm AnandTech (or simply The TeAm). AnandTech contains a wide variety of sub-forums, including the casual environment of AnandTech Off-Topic (or ATOT as the members call it) to the far more technical Highly Technical forum. AnandTech also maintains several highly regulated e-commerce forums, such as Hot Deals and For Sale/For Trade.

In July 2007, the forum underwent major changes that site administrators stated as necessary for furthering userbase growth. The profanity filter was removed (although use of vulgar language is limited), and the identities of traditionally anonymous volunteer moderators were revealed (except two).

<text>Vancouver Island University (abbreviated as VIU, formerly known as Malaspina University-College and Malaspina College) is a Canadian public university serving Vancouver Island and coastal British Columbia. Malaspina College opened in 1969. The main campus is located in Nanaimo, with regional campuses in Duncan and Powell River.

==History==
Vancouver Island University enrolled its first students in September 1969 as Malaspina College, named after Captain Alessandro Malaspina, who explored Vancouver Island. Registration in the first year was over 600 students, almost double what was initially expected. In 1976, after seven years at the original campus in the old Nanaimo Hospital building at 388 Machleary Street, Malaspina College moved to its new campus on Fifth Street (the present location of VIU) on former Department of National Defense land adjoining the existing Nanaimo Vocational Training School, which had offered trades programs since 1936. In anticipation of construction of a new campus, Malaspina College had merged administration with the existing vocational school in 1971.

Following a 1988 government initiative designed to increase access to degree programs in British Columbia, five community colleges in BC were granted authority to offer baccalaureate degrees, and these five institutions — Malaspina, Fraser Valley, Kwantlen, Cariboo and Okanagan—were renamed university colleges. Initially, they offered degrees through one of the three provincial universities.

Malaspina College had regional campuses in Nanaimo, Duncan, and Powell River by 1990. In the 1990s, several at Malaspina promoted the idea of the institution offering something distinct—interdisciplinary bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Liberal Studies — and in 1995 the institution was awarded the authority to offer degrees in its own right. In 1995, the province of British Columbia enacted legislation changing the institution&#x27;s name to Malaspina University-College and allowed it to begin granting academic degrees and college diplomas. Malaspina University-College&#x27;s Arms and Badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on May 20, 1995.

Malaspina University-College was designated a university under an amendment of the &quot;University Act&quot; and officially began operation as Vancouver Island University on September 1, 2008.

Vancouver Island University&#x27;s first president was Dr. Carleton Opgaard. The first chancellor was Chief Shawn A-in-chut Atleo, who in 2009 became the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations. When VIU appointed Chief Atleo as Chancellor he became the first Indigenous person to hold this position in British Columbia.

The university press, &quot;The Navigator&quot;, established in 1969, is a member of Canadian University Press.
The magazine &quot;Portal&quot; has been published by VIU students since 1991.

==Buildings and facilities==

Occupying three campuses and a number of facilities including the Deep Bay Marine Field Station, and Milner Gardens and Woodlands, VIU has had many renovations and major developments in the past few years to accommodate its growing student body and faculty.
* Nanaimo Campus
* Cowichan Campus (Located in Duncan, BC)
* tiwšɛmawtxw (Located in the qathet region)
The main campus located in Nanaimo has of built space. At this main campus, the most recent facility is the Dr. Ralph Nilson Centre for Health &amp; Science and a new Marine, Automotive and Trades Complex, built with funding from the federal and provincial governments as well as through community support.

Another completed project is a district geo-exchange energy system, which uses the energy stored in the water found in the abandoned Wakesiah coal mine underneath the Nanaimo campus to heat and cool some of the university&#x27;s facilities. This system is the first of its kind in Canada. It leverages the long-abandoned coal mining infrastructure to enable an environmentally responsible heating and cooling solution. This open loop geo-exchange system consumes no groundwater while heating and cooling buildings for only the cost of pumping the water. The electricity to power the pumps comes from hydroelectric sources, leading to a zero emissions heating and cooling solution.

In 2006, a Faculty of Management Centre opened certified Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and a renovated library (completed 2005) that offers extensive online and print collections, a special collections reading room, group study rooms, multimedia AV rooms, and computer stations. The VIU Campus Store is also located in the library building.

The Nanaimo campus is home to the Richard W. Johnston Centre for International Education, a gymnasium and fitness facilities; art and music studios; science and computer labs; research centres; a campus career centre; cafeterias; and a student centre on a campus.

Other notable areas on the Nanaimo campus include Shq&#x27;apthut: A Gathering Place, which houses the Elders-in-Residence and staff from VIU&#x27;s Office of Indigenous Education and Engagement; the Kwulasulwut Garden that honours Coast Salish elder and retired VIU Elder-in-Residence Ellen White; two traditional Japanese-style gardens; and the &quot;Jardin des quatorze&quot; (Garden of the Fourteen), which commemorates the women who died in the 1989 mass shooting at the École Polytechnique in Montreal.

In 2011, VIU opened a new campus in Cowichan which is built to LEED Gold Certification. The campus has a rooftop garden and a geo-exchange system which heats and cools the building.

==Core programs==

Vancouver Island University also offers short-term study abroad options in some program areas; destination countries include Belgium, Belize, the Cook Islands, Indonesia, Italy, USA (New York), Tanzania, Korea, France, and Spain. Additionally, Vancouver Island University supports field schools, co-ops, practicum placements and development projects, has sister-school agreements with Japan, Korea and Thailand and educational alliances with schools in Taiwan, China, Mexico, India and Turkey.

== Master of Business Administration (MBA) program ==

VIU&#x27;s Faculty of Management offers graduate business programs that appeal to recent graduates and those individuals who require higher education for career advancement or specialized training. When it was initially accredited, VIU School of Business was one of three Canadian business schools that had been internationally accredited by ACBSP; as of May 2020, eight Canadian universities have ACBSP-accredited programmes.

VIU offers a Master of Business Administration (MBA) that attracts students from around the world. In 2015, the Vancouver Island University MBA Society hosted the first BC MBA Games. The competition was influenced by the national MBA Games and was attended by VIU earlier in the year. MBA students from across British Columbia competed in a range of intensive activities ranging from sports, case competitions and team spirit events. The event was attended by 110 MBA students from Vancouver Island University, Sauder School of Business, Peter B. Gustavson School of Business, Beedie School of Business and Thompson Rivers University. The event&#x27;s theme to raise funds for families living with autism generated a total of $10,138 which was donated to the Canucks Autism Network and the Autism Society of British Columbia.
The event ended with Vancouver Island University emerging as the winner of both the BC MBA Games Cup and the Mann Cup.

Students in Vancouver Island University&#x27;s Master of Business Administration (MBA) program took fourth place in Canada&#x27;s MBA Games. It was held in Toronto from January 2–4, earning the best result for university MBA programs in western Canada.

VIU&#x27;s 32 MBA students competing alongside more than 700 students from 20 Canadian universities also took first place in the “Spirit” competition, with the best result in fundraising, video and opening performance. Of the total $69,269 raised by all teams for the designated charity, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Canada, VIU MBA students raised nearly half, $32,000.

==Indigenous involvement==
VIU developed governing board and senate policies as well as Indigenous governed councils within the university structure. Elders-in-Residence are present on campus at VIU to provide social supports. 

VIU also offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Indigenous/Xwulmuxw Studies. The B.A. Major and Minor in Indigenous/Xwulmuxw Studies are products of a collaboration between Vancouver Island University and the First Nations of Vancouver Island and Coastal British Columbia. Their purpose is to provide comprehensive, high-quality education respectful of the cultures of Indigenous peoples, while meeting their diverse needs.

<text>Tom Carapic (born 1939), full name Tomislav Sava Čarapić, is an artist who specialises in found object artwork.

== Early life and education ==
Carapic was born in Velisevac, Serbia (then Kingdom of Yugoslavia). He was educated at a military school in Herzegovina in the 1950s, and served as a sergeant in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. Afterwards he was denied a college education, possibly because he was not a member of the Communist Party, and illegally crossed into Italy in 1961, and, from there, emigrated to the United States. 

In 1965, he began attending classes at the New York Art Students League, but dropped out soon afterwards, eventually attending the Wilfred Academy of Beauty Culture. He was unable, however, to find steady beauty parlor employment, and worked in menial labor while attending classes in Spanish Education at Manhattan Community College. Due to a problem with accreditation, he was forced to switch to classes in the field of studio art. There he experienced hallucinatory visions that explained his repeated failures to obtain a degree.

== Artwork ==
In the late 1970s, Carapic began experiencing more hallucinatory visions; claiming that his degree problems were caused when &quot;the evil marriage bureau massed the troops&quot; against his college and proceeded with &quot;an Air force bombardment&quot; of the school. After receiving other visitations, he began making and showing his art. 

Most of his art is centered on found objects, most famously computer keyboards, especially those by IBM. Most of his art consists of these objects, marked with black Sharpie markers, and with green thumbprints and handprints along the objects. His most famous exhibit in New York City is &quot;Big Bang Theory,&quot; a doomsday warnings painted on computer keyboards and shoes and construction debris.

<text>The Skitube Alpine Railway is an Australian standard gauge electric rack railway in the Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales. It provides access to the snowfields at Blue Cow Mountain and the Perisher Valley.

==History==
In the 1980s, development of the Thredbo and Perisher Valley skifields was increasing, but the mountain road providing access to them was limited. In 1980 the National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service proposed the establishment of a day visitors resort at Blue Cow Mountain, which would increase the traffic demands. A number of transport modes were examined, including a funicular railway, chairlift, and an aerial gondola, but all were of limited capacity, affected by weather, and would scar the mountainsides.

A rack and pinion railway was found to be the best option, running mostly underground. The Perisher Skitube Joint Venture was established, with Transfield and Kumagai Gumi each holding a 49% share. The main proponent of the scheme, Canberra engineer Ken Bilston, held the remaining 2% share and was technical manager for the project. Feasibility studies commenced in 1982 for a double track railway on the assumption that the road would close in winter, but this was altered to a single track line with passing loops when the closure was ruled out.

Construction commenced in October 1984, with tunnelling beginning in June 1985. The 3.3 km Bilston Tunnel was constructed using a tunnel boring machine, while the 2.6 kilometre Blue Cow tunnel was constructed using the traditional &quot;drill and blast&quot; method. A consortium of Swiss and Australian companies (SLM, BBC, and Comeng) provided the rolling stock, overhead wiring, sub-stations, communications and signalling. The 5.9 kilometre line opened from Bullocks Flat to Perisher on 26 July 1987 with the entire line opened through to Blue Cow on 31 March 1988.

In October 2016, Stadler Rail commenced an upgrade of the line. It was to be completed by April 2017.

== Operations ==

The Swiss-designed railway provides easy access between the Alpine Way at Bullocks Flat and the Perisher Blue ski resort sites of Perisher Valley and Blue Cow Mountain. The Skitube passes through two tunnels and has three stations, two of which are underground. The terminal at Bullocks Flat has parking facilities for 3,500 cars and 250 coaches, as well as passenger, administrative and control facilities.

The line begins at an elevation of 1,125 metres and runs above ground for 2.6 kilometres, 150-metre-long steel curved viaduct. A passing loop is located before entering the tunnel, which climbs on a 12.5% gradient to the Perisher Valley terminal. A provision for a second 300-metre-long passing loop has been made inside the tunnel. To Blue Cow the line first drops downgrade, then climbs 1.3 kilometres on a 3% gradient, then climbs at 12.5% to the terminus. The railway reaches a maximum elevation of 1,905 metres above sea level at Mount Blue Cow station. The workshops include two sidings carriages to be stabled in. The stabling yard is enclosed by a tall electric fence and also houses a diesel tractor used for shunting. A small goods wagon is also used to transport rubbish and other freight from the Blue Cow terminal, as it has no road access in the winter months.

An off-peak schedule is run in early to late June and mid to late September, either side of the peak July–September ski season. Trains run between 05:00 and 01:00, allowing for &quot;après-ski&quot; activities or night skiing. The Bullocks Flat terminus has a large, three-sided station with extensive parking, a pass office, a ski and snowboard school, information desk, kiosk, souvenir shop, and ski and snowboard hire shop. This allows day trippers to get tickets and equipment and be loaded for the 10-minute journey to the Perisher Valley station, and a further 7 minutes to Blue Cow. It is adjacent to the Lake Crackenback Resort.

== Technical details ==
The majority of the railway is underground, comprising the Bilston and Blue Cow tunnels, and long respectively. The depth of the tunnels varies from between , and their diameter between . second-hand rail from the State Rail Authority was used to build the line, and two electrical substations are fed with 33 kV power, and output 1.5 kV DC for the overhead wiring.

== Rolling stock ==
To operate the service 11 carriages were built by Comeng, Granville and Fuji Heavy Industries. Each is long and wide, and can carry 225 passengers. This provides for the movement of around 4,500 people per hour. Eleven passenger cars in total were built, 4 motor cars, 4 driving trailers and 3 non driving trailers. The motor cars each have four traction motors, making them perhaps the most powerful rack railcars in the world. The braking system is mixed regenerative and rheostatic. The train is capable of , however this is limited during the downhill journey to .

Two four-wheel &#x27;S&#x27; open wagons were acquired from the State Rail Authority for freight traffic, and have been cut down to flat wagons. A 1958 Tulloch Limited built locomotive was also purchased.

The trains of the Skitube operate on the Lamella rack system, which was developed by Von Roll Holding.

<text>Korabl-Sputnik 4 ( meaning &quot;Ship-Satellite 4&quot;) or Vostok-3KA No.1, also known as Sputnik 9 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft which was launched on 9 March 1961. Carrying the mannequin Ivan Ivanovich, a dog named Chernushka, some mice and the first guinea pig in space, it was a test flight of the Vostok spacecraft.

Korabl-Sputnik 4 was launched at 06:29:00 UTC on 9 March 1961, atop a Vostok-K carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was successfully placed into low Earth orbit. The spacecraft was only intended to complete a single orbit, so it was deorbited shortly after launch, and reentered on its first pass over the Soviet Union. It landed at 08:09:54 UTC, and was successfully recovered. During the descent, the mannequin was ejected from the spacecraft in a test of its ejection seat, and descended separately under its own parachute.

<text>Eureeka&#x27;s Castle is an American children&#x27;s puppet television series created by Debby Beece and Judy Katschke. R. L. Stine developed the characters and was the head writer of the show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block from September 4, 1989, to November 10, 1991. The program featured various puppet characters who live in a giant&#x27;s wind-up music box. The show was a joint development by Nickelodeon, animators Kit Laybourne and Eli Noyes of Noyes &amp; Laybourne Enterprises, and the puppeteers at 3/Design Studio.

==Synopsis==
The show follows various puppet characters including Eureeka, a sorceress-in-training. Eureeka and her friends live in a wind-up castle music box owned by a friendly giant. Other characters include Magellan the dragon, twin moat dwellers Bogge and Quagmire, Batly the bat, and Mr. Knack the handyman. There are also various appearing creatures such as mice, singing fish statues called the Fishtones, Magellan&#x27;s pets Cooey and the Slurms, and Batly&#x27;s pet spider Webster.

Halfway through the episode, an animated short based on a children&#x27;s book was shown. Also featured were shorter animated and live-action short films and European imports such as &quot;Animal Fair&quot;, &quot;Roobarb&quot;, &quot;The Shoe People&quot;, &quot;Towser&quot;, &quot;James the Cat&quot;, &quot;Le Piaf&quot;, &quot;Plonsters&quot;, &quot;Philipp,&quot; &quot;Bojan the Bear,&quot; &quot;Lilliput Put,&quot; &quot; Zeno shorts,&quot; 
and &quot;Gran&quot;. Musical guests also appeared on the show, performing either in one of Mr. Knack&#x27;s postcards, or at the castle in person.

==Characters==
* Eureeka (performed by Cheryl Blaylock) is the title character and protagonist. Eureeka is a friendly sorceress-in-training. Her spells are not successful most of the time, but she keeps trying until she gets it right. Aside from her magic, she usually helps solve her friends&#x27; problems.
* Magellan (performed by Noel MacNeal) is a large, childlike green dragon with a tail that has a mind of its own. He does not always understand new concepts. Magellan tends to make great big sneezes that can shake the whole castle whenever he gets upset. He has a mother-son/older sibling like relationship with Eureeka. According to Eureeka, Magellan will do anything to try and stay awake past bedtime. One talent that Magellan can do is blow bubbles from his mouth.
** Cooey (performed by Lynn Hippen) is Magellan&#x27;s pet of indeterminate species.
** Slurms are Magellan&#x27;s pet worm hybrids.
** Blanketeers are living blue dots on Magellan&#x27;s blanket.
* Batly (performed by Jim Kroupa) is an egotistical, clumsy, blue bat who wears glasses due to being nearsighted. Despite being different in every way, he and Magellan are good friends. His flying usually ends with a crash landing prompting him to say &quot;I meant to do that.&quot; Batly spends most of his time in the belfry and has a large bug collection. In a 2016 Reddit AMA, R.L. Stine said that Batly&#x27;s face was modeled after his own son Matt.
** Webster (performed by Noel MacNeal) is Batly&#x27;s intimidating pet spider.
** Fred is Batly&#x27;s lightning bug whom he sleeps with.
* Bogge and Quagmire (performed by Brian Muehl and Pam Arciero) are the Moat Twins. They are two mischievous squabbling siblings who spend most of their time swimming in the polluted castle moat, eating peanut butter sandwiches, and playing in the basement. Bogge is orange while Quagmire is pink. They&#x27;re never apart, unless there&#x27;s a troubling situation. They tend to argue with each other, but work together when it comes to causing trouble. Bogge and Quagmire constantly try to steal Magellan&#x27;s peanut butter sandwiches, but never succeed. They&#x27;re capable of moving, talking, breathing, and playing on land or underwater with equal ease. Their favorite game is to challenge each other with tongue-twister statements, at which they are highly proficient. While they spend much of their time bickering, they quickly become bored and then saddened to the point of depression, if even temporarily separated from the other.
* Mr. Knack (performed by Brian Muehl) is the castle&#x27;s handyman and tinker. He uses many unconventional methods for fixing things around the castle. Mr. Knack also loves to barter when he sells some of his inventions that he has made from his pushcart. Mr. Knack always gets some postcards which he reads to the viewers. His first name is &quot;Nick&quot;, giving him the name Nick Knack.
* Sir Klank (performed by Jim Kroupa) is a blue mouse with a long gray beard who resides in a suit of armor.
* Kate (performed by Lynn Hippen) is a pink mouse who frequently reports on what happens in the castle.
* Emma (performed by Pam Arciero) is an orange mouse who loves to eat.
* The Fishtones are a trio of singing fish in the form of a stone fountain who spray water when they&#x27;re not singing.
* The Giant (performed by Jim Kroupa) is a friendly full-bodied giant with a big nose and a long orange beard who owns the wind-up castle music box where the show takes place. Once per episode, he winds up the castle&#x27;s music box key to introduce the episode&#x27;s musical guest. The castle inhabitants are aware of his existence, and in rare incidents they attempt to summon his attention.

==Production==
&quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot;&#x27;s ending credits state the show comes from an original concept by Debby Beece and Judy Katschke. In 1988, development of the show began by staff members at Nickelodeon and animator Eli Noyes and his partner Kit Laybourne, whose wife Geraldine Laybourne was the Head of Programming for Nickelodeon. &quot;Jovial Bob Stine&quot;, best known for his children&#x27;s horror novels written under the pen name R. L. Stine, was hired as the head writer to develop the concept, characters and episode scripts. The puppet design and construction for the characters were done at 3/Design Studio where the puppets were built by Jim Kroupa, John Orberg, Kip Rathke and Matt Stoddart.

Nickelodeon ordered 65 episodes of &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot;, and Beece called it &quot;the most ambitious program for preschoolers since the premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; 20 years ago&quot;. The first episode of &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; premiered during Nickelodeon&#x27;s Special Delivery block on August 27, 1989, before debuting on Nick Jr. on September 4. In May 1990, &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; was renewed for a 35-episode second season.

From 1990 to 1991, Nickelodeon created 52 half-hour episodes of &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot;, compiling clips from the first two seasons, for international distribution and their participation in the Cable in the Classroom service. Nick Jr. continued to air the original hour-long episodes, which were shortened to half-hour episodes in 1994. Production on &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; ended in 1991; some of the show&#x27;s crew later worked on &quot;Gullah Gullah Island&quot;.

<doc id="876994" wikidata="Q1453053" url="?curid=876994" title="Island of the Blue Dolphins">
<text>Island of the Blue Dolphins is a 1960 children&#x27;s novel by American writer Scott O&#x27;Dell, which tells the story of a girl named Karana, who is stranded alone for years on an island off the California coast. It is based on the true story of Juana Maria, a Nicoleño Native American left alone for 18 years on San Nicolas Island during the nineteenth century.

&quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; won the Newbery Medal in 1961. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1964. O&#x27;Dell later wrote a sequel, &quot;Zia&quot;, published in 1976. &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; has been the subject of much literary and pedagogical scholarship related to survival, feminism, the resilience of Indigenous peoples, and beyond.

==Historical basis==
The book is based on the true story of &quot;The Lone Woman of San Nicholas Island,&quot; a Nicoleño Native Californian who lived alone for 18 years on San Nicolas Island, one of the Channel Islands off the California coast.

Around 1835, the Nicoleño people were taken aboard a ship headed for California, with the intention that missionaries would convert them upon arrival on the mainland. Once aboard the ship, it was realized that Juana Maria was not among them. By that time, a strong storm arose, and the crew of &quot;Peor es Nada,&quot; realizing the imminent danger of being wrecked by the surf and rocks, panicked and sailed toward the mainland, leaving her behind.

A more romantic version tells of Juana Maria diving overboard after realizing her younger brother had been left behind, although archaeologist Steven J. Schwartz notes, &quot;The story of her jumping overboard does not show up until the 1880s ... By then the Victorian era is well underway, and literature takes on a flowery, even romantic flavor.&quot; Due to inclement sea-faring weather, the ship could not return and she lived on the island for nearly two decades before being discovered and taken to the mainland in 1853 by sea otter hunter Captain George Nidever and his crew. According to Nidever, the Lone Woman lived in a structure supported by whale ribs and stashed useful objects around the island. She was baptized and given the Christian name Juana Maria, assigned to her by the Santa Barbara Mission where she eventually was brought. No one alive at that time spoke her language, so she struggled to communicate using a form of sign language. Just as the other Nicoleño Natives, who had previously been brought to the mainland, the Lone Woman died of dysentery after seven weeks.

In 2009, the University of Oregon archaeologist Jon Erlandson found two old redwood boxes eroding from an island sea cliff, with whalebone placed on top of them. With colleagues René Vellanoweth, Lisa Barnett-Thomas, and Troy Davis, Erlandson salvaged the boxes and other artifacts before they were destroyed by erosion. Vellanoweth and Barnett-Thomas examined the contents in a San Nicolas Island laboratory, documenting nearly 200 artifacts of Nicoleño, Euro-American, and Native Alaskan manufacture. The boxes appear to have been cached intentionally sometime between 1725 and 1743. It was also believed the Lone Woman lived in a cave on the island.

In 2012, archaeologist Steve Schwartz believed he discovered the location of that cave based upon a century old map and began an investigation, working with archaeologist René Vellanoweth and his students from California State University, Los Angeles. The team’s work resulted in the opening of the cave being excavated, but local Native American tribes requested the dig be stopped and the Navy complied. Commanders at the Navy base on the island ordered Schwartz to halt the dig in 2015. The following year, Professor Patricia Martz started an online petition to stop the Navy’s plans to move artifacts from San Nicolas Island to a facility in China Lake. Despite gaining over 390 signatures, representatives from the Navy responded to the petition and formally expressed the safety and regulatory requirements met by China Lake. As such, the articles from San Nicolas were moved.

==Plot summary==
The main character is a Nicoleño girl named Karana. She has a brother named Ramo and an older sister named Ulape. Her people live in a village called Ghalas-at and the tribe survives by gathering roots and fishing and hunting.

One day, a ship of Russian fur hunters and their Creole and Aleut workers led by Captain Orlov arrive and persuade the Nicoleños to let them hunt sea otter in exchange for other goods. However, the Russians attempt to swindle the islanders by leaving without paying. When they are confronted by Karana&#x27;s father Chief Chowig, a battle breaks out. Karana&#x27;s father and many other men in the tribe die in battle against the well-armed Russians.

Later, the &quot;replacement&quot; Chief Kimki leaves the island on a canoe for new land in the East. Eventually, he sends a &quot;giant canoe&quot; to bring his people to the mainland even though he himself does not return. The white missionaries come to Karana&#x27;s village and tell them to pack their goods and go to the ship. Karana&#x27;s brother Ramo runs off to retrieve his fishing spear. Although Karana urges the captain to wait for Ramo to return, the ship must leave before a storm approaches. Despite restraint, Karana jumps off the ship and swims to shore and the ship departs without them.

While awaiting the return of the ship, Ramo is brutally killed by a pack of feral dogs. Alone on the island, Karana takes on everyone&#x27;s tasks, such as hunting, making spears, and building canoes to survive. She vows to avenge her brother&#x27;s death and kills several of the dogs, but has a change of heart when she encounters the leader of the pack. She tames him and names him Rontu.

Over time, Karana makes a life for herself, even successfully hunting a giant devilfish (a massive creature like an octopus or squid) with Rontu. She builds a home made of whale bones and stocks a cave with provisions in case the Aleuts come back, so she can hide from them. She also tames some birds and an otter, named Mon-a-nee, while feeling a close kinship to the animals (the only inhabitants of the island beside herself).

One summer, the Aleuts return and Karana takes refuge in the cave. She observes the Aleuts closely and realizes that a girl named Tutok takes care of the domestic duties including getting water from the pool near Karana&#x27;s cave. Fearful of being discovered, Karana goes out only at night, yet the curious girl stalks Karana, and the two meet. Karana and Tutok exchange gifts and she realizes how lonely she has been. The next day, Karana sees the ship with Tutok departing. Then, she returns to her house and starts rebuilding.

More time passes, and Rontu dies. Karana soon finds a young dog that looks like Rontu and takes him in naming him Rontu-Aru. One day, Karana sees the sails of a ship, but it moors off-shore and leaves. Two years later in the spring, the boat returns. Karana dresses in her finest attire, a dress of cormorant feathers, and waits on the shore for the boat. Her rescuers make a dress for her, as they believe her dress of cormorant feathers is not appropriate for the mainland. She does not like the dress, but Karana realizes that it is part of her new life. The ship takes Karana, Rontu-Aru, and her two birds to the mission in Santa Barbara, California. There, Father Gonzales tells her that the ship that had taken her tribe away had sunk before it could return to the Island of the Blue Dolphins for her.

==Publication==
===First edition===
After witnessing animal cruelty near his home, O’Dell first wrote &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; in 1960, to promote a respect for all forms of life. Its first submission was turned down, as the publisher believed the story should feature a male protagonist. Yet, O’Dell felt strongly about Karana’s presence and looked to other publishing companies. Although he wrote the novel with the intended audience of adults, O’Dell’s next publisher suggested that it would be better for children, and it was published that same year. Soon after, in 1961, it had tremendous success and was awarded the Newbery Medal.

===Critical edition===
The 50th Anniversary edition of &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; includes a new introduction by Newbery Medalist Lois Lowry and also includes extracts from Father Gonzales Rubio in the Santa Barbara Mission&#x27;s Book of Burials. Island of the Blue Dolphins: The Complete Reader&#x27;s Edition, a critical edition edited by Sara L. Schwebel, was published in October 2016 by the University of California Press. It includes two chapters deleted from the book before publication.

===Sequel===
O&#x27;Dell later wrote a sequel, Zia, published in 1976.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation of &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; was released on July 3, 1964. It was directed by James B. Clark and starred Celia Kaye as Karana. Jane Klove and Ted Sherdeman adapted the script from O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s novel, and the film was produced by Robert B. Radnitz and Universal Pictures. The film was made on a slight budget but did receive a wide release three months after its New York premiere. Howard Thompson writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized it as a children&#x27;s film. Kaye won a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year for her performance. The film earned an estimated $2 million in rentals in North America.

==Reception==
At the time of the book&#x27;s publication, &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; said: &quot;Years of research must have gone into this book to turn historical fact into so moving and lasting an experience.&quot; In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1956 to 1965, librarian Carolyn Horovitz wrote: &quot;The girl, Karana, is portrayed in such intimate and close relationship with the natural elements of her background, the earth, the sea, the animals, the fish, that the reader is given both the terror and beauty of life itself. It is a book to make the reader &quot;wonder&quot;.&quot;

==Analysis==
===Literary analysis===
Since the time of its publication, &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; has been the subject of many pieces of literary scholarship. The text explores the themes of independence, vulnerability, growth, survival, paternalism, and rescue, among others. The first-person point of view employed throughout the text is another narrative technique that serves to strengthen Karana&#x27;s characterization and convey her courage and love.

The book can be considered a &quot;Robinsonade&quot;, meaning that it tells the story of a character who must survive on a deserted island (or the equivalent), named after &quot;The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Diann L. Baecker, a professor of Languages and Literature, suggests that the text is more than merely a &quot;rescue narrative&quot; where an orphan girl needs to be saved by a paternalistic hero. Rather, Baecker argues that readers themselves can interpret &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; to be a feminist parable and story of survival.

Many attribute the long-lasting power of the novel to this existence of a strong female protagonist with unisex characteristics, brought to the public during a time when this was not the norm. Karana takes on roles typically associated with men in order to survive, such as her skillful crafting of weapons. At the same time, Karana remains tied to her feminine association with nature as she lovingly cares for hurt animals and vows never to hunt them again. Literary scholar and professor C. Anita Tarr argues the success of the story should be attributed to Karana&#x27;s lack of emotions and the major gaps in O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s writing, which allow readers to fill in their own interpretations and feelings.

Additionally, scholars agree that &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; has both challenged and reproduced harmful stereotypes of Native peoples that had been propagated by past publications. Jon C. Stott, a professor of English, states that O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s position as a Non-Native writer helped bring more attention to the culture and stories of Indigenous people. A past chair of the Scott O&#x27;Dell Award for Historical Fiction, Hazel Rochman, also notes the challenges associated with writing authentically about another culture, yet suggests that O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s research and empathy present in the text allowed it to become a long-lasting success.

Carole Goldberg, a Professor of Law and scholar of Native American studies, highlights &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; as what is known as a &quot;vanishing Indian story&quot;. Such stories perpetuate the idea that all Native tribes were assimilated into white society in the United States, while ignoring all moral and legal issues related to the colonization of Native Americans. &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; plays into this harmful idea as all the members of Karana’s tribe are either brutally killed or taken away by missionaries, thus disappearing from the narrative entirely. Yet, an alternative reading of the text centered around cultural repatriation and land rights can still serve as a metaphor for tribal resilience.

===Pedagogical analysis===
Sara L. Schwebel, chair of the Carolina Children’s Literature consortium and English professor, states that &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; should be better integrated into school curriculum alongside relevant contemporary scholarship. Further, she contends that children can grapple with critical issues such as colonialism, disempowerment, and resilience in school settings. Children may also be more capable of dealing with death in books than adults perceive them to be, and exposure to &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; or texts with similar depictions of death can be helpful for children to begin processing the concept of death at an early age.

<text>The Connemara Public Library at Egmore in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, is one of the four National Depository Libraries which receive a copy of all books, newspapers and periodicals published in India. Established in 1896, the library is a repository of century-old publications, wherein lie some of the most respected works and collections in the history of the country. It also serves as a depository library for the United Nations. It is located in the Government Museum Complex on Pantheon Road, Egmore, which also houses the Government Museum and the National Art Gallery.

==History==

The library&#x27;s beginnings go back to 1860, when Captain Jesse Mitchell set up a small library as part of the Madras Museum in Madras, capital of the Madras Presidency in the British Indian Empire. Hundreds of books had been found to be surplus in the libraries of Haileybury College (where civil servants of the Indian Civil Service were trained in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire) and these were sent to the Madras Government, which in turn handed them over to the Madras Museum. Conceived on the lines of the British Museum Library, it was part of the Madras Museum until 1890, when the need for a free public library prompted the then Governor of Madras, Lord Connemara, to lay the foundation on 22 March 1890. It opened in 1896 and was named after Lord Connemara (by then the former Governor), an Anglo-Irish nobleman. The library was indeed essentially free: A small deposit had to be paid but this was refundable. It became the state central library in 1948, with the enactment of Madras Public Libraries Act 1948, which was the first concerted effort in India to institutionalise, structure, otherwise, co-ordinate and organise public library services. This is one of Asia&#x27;s largest libraries.

The library was as part of a cultural complex that grew in the grounds of what was once called The Pantheon. The entire complex now boasts buildings that reflect architectural unity, even while demonstrating the various stages of Indo-Saracenic development, from Gothic-neo-Byzantine to Rajput Mughal and Southern Hindu Deccani.

The new building, which was added to the library in 1973, has a vast collection of books, a much sought-after textbook section, a periodicals hall, a reference room, a video room, an entire floor for books from the Indian languages, a Braille Library and an IAS study centre. Efforts are on to fully computerise the library database, which could ensure easy access to books. The library has a collection of over 600,000 books.

In 1981 the central government ordered that the library became one of the four national depository libraries. The library, however, is not a registered member of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).

==Collections==
The library, along with the Madras museum, benefited greatly from the effects of the Madras Literary Society, the Oriental Manuscripts Library and the Records Office. Under the provision of Delivery of Books and Newspapers (Public Libraries) Act 1954, every publisher in India has to compulsorily send a copy of each publication to the library. Apart from this a good number of publications and periodicals of UN and its specialized organs and Asian Development Bank were also received. Furthermore, several books were added every year by purchasing from the funds made available by the state government budget. The collection includes rare books including a 1608 Bible.

<doc id="876997" wikidata="Q1190137" url="?curid=876997" title="Greater Boston">
<text>Greater Boston is the metropolitan region of New England encompassing the municipality of Boston, the capital of the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England, and its surrounding areas. The most stringent definition of the region, used by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, consists of most of the eastern third of mainland Massachusetts, excluding the Merrimack Valley and most of Southeastern Massachusetts, though most definitions (including the U.S. Census definition) include much of these areas and portions of southern New Hampshire.
While the city of Boston covers and has 675,647 residents as of the 2020 census, the urbanization has extended well into surrounding areas and the Combined Statistical Area (CSA in the rest of the document), which includes the Providence, Rhode Island, Manchester, New Hampshire, Cape Cod and Worcester areas, has a population of more than 8.4 million people, making it one of the most populous such regions in the U.S.

Some of Greater Boston&#x27;s most well-known contributions involve the region&#x27;s higher education and medical institutions. Greater Boston has been influential upon American history and industry. The region and the state of Massachusetts are global leaders in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.

Greater Boston is ranked tenth in population among US metropolitan statistical areas, home to 4,941,632 people as of the 2020 United States census, and sixth among combined statistical areas, with a population of 8,466,186. The area has hosted many people and sites significant to American culture and history, particularly American literature, politics, and the American Revolution.

Plymouth was the site of the first colony in New England, founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims, passengers of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. In 1692, the town of Salem and surrounding areas experienced one of America&#x27;s most infamous cases of mass hysteria, the Salem witch trials. In the late 18th century, Boston became known as the &quot;Cradle of Liberty&quot; for the agitation there that led to the American Revolution.

The Greater Boston region has played a powerful scientific, commercial, and cultural role in the history of the United States. Before the American Civil War, the region was a center for the abolitionist, temperance, and transcendentalist movements. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legally recognize same-sex marriage as a result of the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in Boston. Many prominent American political dynasties have hailed from the Boston region, including the Adams and Kennedy families.

Harvard University in Cambridge is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, founded in 1636, with the largest financial endowment of any university, and whose Law School has spawned a contemporaneous majority of United States Supreme Court Justices. Kendall Square in Cambridge has been called &quot;the most innovative square mile on the planet&quot;, in reference to the high concentration of entrepreneurial start-ups and quality of innovation which have emerged in the vicinity of the square since 2010. Both Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also in Cambridge, have been ranked among the most highly regarded academic institutions in the world.

==Geography==
=== Boundary definitions ===
====Metropolitan Area====

The most restrictive definition of the Greater Boston area is the region administered by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. The MAPC is a regional planning organization created by the Massachusetts legislature to oversee transportation infrastructure and economic development concerns in the Boston area. The MAPC includes 101 cities and towns that are grouped into eight subregions. These include most of the area within the region&#x27;s outer circumferential highway, I-495. In 2013, the population of the MAPC district was 3.2 million, which was 48% of the total population of Massachusetts, in an area of , of which 39% is forested and an additional 11% is water, wetland, or other open space.

The cities and towns included in this definition are:
====New England City and Town Area====
Two definitions are used by the United States Census to define the Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA–NH Metro Area or Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA–NH Metropolitan NECTA, which is defined as a New England City and Town Area.

*Essex County, Massachusetts
*Middlesex County, Massachusetts
*Norfolk County, Massachusetts
*Plymouth County, Massachusetts
*Suffolk County, Massachusetts
*Rockingham County, New Hampshire
*Strafford County, New Hampshire

The NECTA definition includes all of the communities from the MAPC definition, as well as the Merrimack Valley communities, parts of southern New Hampshire (northward to Milford and Hampton, and the Taunton area.

====Combined Statistical Area====
The widest definition of the metropolitan area based on commuting patterns, is defined by the U.S. Census as the Boston–Worcester–Providence combined statistical area. This area consists of the following counties in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire:

*Connecticut
**Windham County, Connecticut
*Massachusetts
**Barnstable County, Massachusetts
**Bristol County, Massachusetts
**Essex County, Massachusetts

==Demographics==


Greater Boston has a sizable Jewish community, estimated at between 210,000 people, and 261,000 or 5–6% of the Greater Boston metro population, compared with about 2% for the nation as a whole. Contrary to national trends, the number of Jews in Greater Boston has been growing, fueled by the fact that 60% of children in Jewish mixed-faith families are raised Jewish, compared with roughly one in three nationally. The 2020 PRRI Atlas found that 35% of the Boston metro area identified as Protestant while 26% identified as Catholic.

The City of Boston also has one of the largest LGBT populations per capita. It ranks fifth of all major cities in the country (behind San Francisco, and slightly behind Seattle, Atlanta, and Minneapolis), with 12.3% of the city identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.

<text>Pilcomayo (in Hispanicized spelling) (Quechua Pillkumayu or Pillku Mayu, &quot;pillku&quot; red, &quot;mayu&quot; river, &quot;red river&quot;, Guarani Ysyry Araguay ) is a river in central South America. At long, it is the longest western tributary of the Paraguay River. Its drainage basin is in area, and its mean discharge is .

Along its course, the Pilcomayo silts up and splits into two main branches, North and South. After some distance, these branches rejoin to form the Lower Pilcomayo.

The Pilcomayo rises in the foothills of the Andes mountain range in the Oruro Department in Bolivia, east of Lake Poopó. The Jach&#x27;a Juqhu River is considered the origin of the Pilcomayo. Upstream the Jach&#x27;a Juqhu River successively receives the names Aguas Calientes and Kachi Mayu. From the confluence with the Chillawa &quot;(Chillahua)&quot;, the river is called Pilcomayo. From there, it flows in a southeasterly direction through Chuquisaca and Tarija departments, passes through the Argentine province of Formosa and the Gran Chaco plains of Paraguay, forming most of the border between these two countries before it joins the &quot;Paraguay River&quot; near Asunción. The Río Pilcomayo National Park is located on the Argentine side of the border. It also forms a short part of the boundary between Argentina and Bolivia, just prior to the Argentina–Bolivia–Paraguay tripoint.

==Human settlement==
The river basin is home to approximately 1.5 million people: one million in Bolivia, 300,000 in Argentina, and 200,000 in Paraguay.

The Nakotoi Indian Tribe resides in the southern region of the Pilcomayo, a region located along the river in central Paraguay. The aborigines of this tribe are descendants of the highly renowned Redskin Tribe. The Natokoi treated all neighbors as enemies, but none more so than the Tobas Tribe and the Nimká Tribe, their respective neighbors to the southwest and northeast. Guerrilla warfare has long existed between the tribes, isolating the tribe from direct intercourse with the European settlers in the late 19th century. Men of this tribe are generally tall and skinny, built like hunters or warriors, whereas women are short in size. The Natokoi dress in a rug, fastened around the waist-line.

<doc id="877005" wikidata="Q18934" url="?curid=877005" title="Korabl-Sputnik 5">
<text>Korabl-Sputnik 5 ( meaning &quot;Ship-Satellite 5&quot;) or Vostok-3KA No.2, also known as Sputnik 10 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft which was launched in 1961, as part of the Vostok programme. It was the last test flight of the Vostok spacecraft design prior the first crewed flight, Vostok 1. It carried the mannequin Ivan Ivanovich, a dog named Zvezdochka (&quot;Starlet&quot;, or &quot;Little star&quot;), frogs, monkeys, mice, rats, plants, television cameras and scientific apparatus.

==Background==

A spacecraft of the design &quot;Vostok 3KA&quot; had only been launched once before, which was on March 9, 1961. This mission was called Korabl-Sputnik 4, and it was a complete success. Prior to Korabl-Sputnik 4, the two previous missions in the Vostok programme were both launched in December 1960, and both ended in failure.

Only days before the launch of Korabl-Sputnik 5, the cosmonaut team, which consisted of 20 men, experienced its first fatality. Cosmonaut candidate Valentin Bondarenko was killed in a fire during a training exercise in an oxygen-rich isolation chamber. It&#x27;s not clear whether other cosmonauts were told of his death; the media didn&#x27;t learn of Bondarenko&#x27;s death - or even of his existence - until many years later, in 1986.

==Mission==

Korabl-Sputnik 5 was launched at 05:54:00 UTC on 25 March 1961, atop a Vostok-K carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was successfully placed into low Earth orbit. As planned, the spacecraft completed a single orbit, and then reentered the atmosphere over the Soviet Union; the total flight time was approximately that of other single-orbit missions, so about 105 minutes. During the descent, the mannequin was ejected from the spacecraft in a successful test of its ejection seat, and descended separately under its own parachute, as it had done on the previous mission, Korabl-Sputnik 4. It landed at approximately 07:40 UTC, northeast of Izhevsk, near the Chaykovsky, Perm Krai.

===Cosmonaut Communications Test/Hoax===
The mannequin carried a tape recording to test communication systems. In an attempt to avoid independent radio operators mistakenly believing the capsule was crewed, and especially to avoid the Americans thinking it was a crewed satellite reconnaissance mission, the recordings contained intentional giveaways. These included a musical choir and a male voice reading out the recipe for borscht, an Eastern European beetroot soup, as though the cosmonaut was preparing it. Making soup would not have been possible in zero gravity, and the Soviets figured &quot;even the most gullible Western intelligence man knew you couldn&#x27;t fit a choir in a Korabl-Sputnik satellite.&quot; Nonetheless, non-Russian speaking listeners who tuned in to the radio transmissions did initially and erroneously believe that there was a cosmonaut aboard. Alexei Leonov would later recall: &quot;since no announcement of the flight had been released by our state news agency, TASS, rumors spread like wildfire that a crewed space flight had gone wrong and been covered up.&quot;

===Capsule recovery===
The landing occurred during a snowstorm, which caused delays in locating exactly where touchdown occurred. It was about 24 hours after landing when a recovery team arrived at the site. Local villagers assisted the team to the landing area, with the help of a horse-drawn sled. The recovery team noted that the spacecraft was still hot to touch, 24 hours after landing in five feet of snow. The nearby villages were suspicious of the recovery teams, believing that the mannequin was in fact a person who may have been badly injured.

==Legacy==
The success of Korabl-Sputnik 5 was the final step required to get approval for a crewed mission. That crewed mission, known as Vostok 1, would occur on about April 12, 1961, carrying the world&#x27;s first human space traveller, Yuri Gagarin. The spacecraft Gagarin used was a nearly identical model, called &quot;Vostok 3KA-3&quot;. A major difference between the 3KA-2 and 3KA-3 spacecraft was that the 3KA-2 version, like all uncrewed Vostok spacecraft, was equipped with a self-destruct system, in the event it reentered the atmosphere over foreign territory.

===2011 Auction===
The re-entry module of the spacecraft Vostok 3KA-2 was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s on 12 April 2011, the 50th anniversary of Gagarin&#x27;s spaceflight, Vostok 1. The spacecraft was expected to sell for USD 2–10 million, and was sold for US$2,882,500.

===2020 COVID-19 Vaccine===
On August 11, 2020 the Russian government announced the world&#x27;s first release of a vaccine against COVID-19, referring to the vaccine as &quot;Sputnik V&quot; (Gam-COVID-Vac) to reflect Russia&#x27;s previous victories in the Space Race.

<text>RG Line Oy Ab was a Finnish shipping company founded in 2001 that operated a ferry line between Vaasa, Finland and Umeå, Sweden until the end of 2012. Nowadays the Vaasa-Umeå line is operated by Wasa Line. 

The company was founded in 2001 by well known Vaasa-based businessman Rabbe Grönblom, just months after Silja Line had put their traffic on Kvarken / Merenkurkku to an end because of a decision in the EU to stop taxfree sales on travels between member states. RG Line bought Silja&#x27;s M/S &quot;Fennia&quot; and renamed her to M/S &quot;Casino Express&quot;, the ship was put in traffic on the route Vaasa–Umeå on 16 May 2001. At first RG Line profiled the ship as a ship where you could have fun and party, much like the ferries who trafficked Kvarken in the tax-free times. However, it did not become a success; people did not want to cruise any more. The blackjack and roulette tables they had added to get a casino feeling were removed before a year had passed. The company focused on ordinary travellers and cargo instead. The route over Kvarken was supported financially by the city of Vaasa. The city of Umeå or the county of Västerbotten do not support international connections because of a policy. The county of Västerbotten is responsible for local bus transport, but they don&#x27;t have a bus line to the Umeå port, the nearest is away.

The company filed for bankruptcy on 29 November 2011, and the operations are suspended. Despite the bankruptcy, the company is continuing operations until October 2012.

==History 2004–2005==
On 23 November 2004 RG Line announced that they had bought the ship M/S &quot;Kahleberg&quot;, which has more capacity for cargo and takes less passengers than &quot;Casino Express&quot;, which it will replace. It is said that &quot;Kahleberg&quot; will be put into traffic between Vaasa and Umeå in May 2005.

On 24 November, one day after RG Line informed the public about the purchase of their new ship &quot;Kahleberg&quot;, bad luck struck the company. &quot;Casino Express&quot;, with 39 passengers and 27 crew members on board, ran aground just outside the harbour of Holmsund near Umeå. At the time of the accident, there were strong south-western winds up to . &quot;Casino Express&quot; got some serious damages that had to be repaired; six days after the grounding the ship was pulled from the reef and then towed to a repair shipyard in Estonia.

On 26 November, RG Line announced that they had chartered M/S &quot;Alandia&quot; from Eckerö Linjen to temporarily sail for the company while &quot;Casino Express&quot; was being repaired in Estonia. &quot;Alandia&quot; is a well-known ship for people in the Kvarken region, as she had been trafficking for Vasabåtarna for thirteen years as &quot;Botnia Express&quot; before she was sold to Eckerö Linjen.

&quot;Alandia&quot;, which at the time of &quot;Casino Express&quot;″ accident was laid up in Eckerö, was sent to a repair shipyard in Stockholm to fix a broken propeller. After that she would immediately take up the traffic for RG Line. She arrived at Holmsund on 9 December, where she loaded cargo, food et cetera that had been on &quot;Casino Express&quot;. &quot;Alandia&quot; took off to Vaasa that evening; she would make her first regular trip from there the morning after. But the ship did not get far; she ran aground on the same place as &quot;Casino Express&quot; did just weeks earlier. &quot;Alandia&quot; suffered some damages and could not continue to Vaasa; she was instead sent off to a repair shipyard in Mariehamn and RG Line was once again without a ship.

RG Line&#x27;s new ship &quot;Kahleberg&quot; arrived to Vaasa in the last days of January 2005. The plan was to rebuild the ship and not put it into traffic until in May. &quot;Alandia&quot; was still being repaired, RG Line did not want to wait for her to get back. Instead they decided to put the unrenovated &quot;Kahleberg&quot; into traffic on January 21. On her first trip to Umeå she had a motor breakdown about 10 minutes out of Vaasa and had to set anchor; she eventually made it to Umeå but delayed. &quot;Kahleberg&quot; was classed to take no more than 75 passengers; RG Line intended to reclass her after having renovated her. The local newspapers criticized RG Line for putting a ship with such low passenger capacity and low comfort into traffic. For the school&#x27;s winter holidays, when travelling between Sweden and Finland rises, RG Line had to charter the now repaired &quot;Alandia&quot;, which have a higher passenger capacity. She was in traffic between Umeå and Vaasa between 26 February and March 9 instead of &quot;Kahleberg&quot;.

On April 23, &quot;Kahleberg&quot; was chartered to deliver cargo to Sundsvall. At the same time RG Line announced that, starting that summer, they would make one trip a week to Sundsvall.

On May 1, &quot;Casino Express&quot; returned from the Estonian shipyard and was put back in traffic on her old route. The renovation of &quot;Kahleberg&quot; could now finally begin.

==Route==
RG Line operated one route across the Gulf of Bothnia. The crossing between Vaasa and Umeå (Holmsund) took 4 hours and 30 minutes. 

==Fleet==
RG Line operated one vessel.

<doc id="877011" wikidata="Q1187811" url="?curid=877011" title="College town">
<text>A college town or university town is a town or city whose character is dominated by a college or university and their associated culture, often characterised by the student population making up 20 percent of the population of the community, but not including communities that are parts of larger urban areas (often termed student quarters). The university may be large, or there may be several smaller institutions such as liberal arts colleges clustered, or the residential population may be small, but college towns in all cases are so dubbed because the presence of the educational institution(s) pervades economic and social life. Many local residents may be employed by the university—which may be the largest employer in the community—many businesses cater primarily to the university, and the student population may outnumber the local population.

==Description==

In Europe, a university town is generally characterised by having an old university. The economy of the city is closely related with the university activity and highly supported by the entire university structure, which may include university hospitals and clinics, printing houses, libraries, laboratories, business incubators, student rooms, dining halls, students&#x27; unions, student societies, and academic festivities. Moreover, the history of the city is often intertwined with that of the university. Many European university towns have not merely been important places of science and education, but also centres of political, cultural and social influence throughout the centuries. In university towns such as Oxford, Cambridge, St Andrews and Durham, the town centre is dominated both physically and functionally by the university, with the result that the town has become identified with the university. While in many historical university towns, the town has grown up around the university, Durham is an example of a university town where the university has &#x27;colonised&#x27; the town centre. 

Besides a highly educated and largely transient population, a stereotypical college town often has many people in non-traditional lifestyles and subcultures and with a high tolerance for unconventionality in general, and has a very active musical or cultural scene. Many have become centres of technological research and innovative startups. Universities with start-up centers can be large cities like Munich, but also small cities like Trieste.

==Development==
In most of Europe, medieval universities grew or were founded in major urban areas rather than in college towns, although there were exceptions such as Siena in Italy, Tübingen in Germany and Cambridge in England. In the US, by contrast, the development of universities preceded urban growth and founders of colleges often chose (after the models of Oxford and Cambridge) to site their institutions away from cities, although, as at Cambridge, Massachusetts, home of Harvard University, the metropolitan areas have sometimes since expanded to take in the college town. A second driver of the growth of college towns in the US was that towns that wished to develop economically competed to attract colleges with donations of cash and land.

As a result of this history, the university buildings in classical European university towns are located on multiple sites in the city centre, while the university buildings in American college towns are concentrated on a campus distinct from the city itself. Thus, the student residential area in historic European university towns such as Oxford, Cambridge and Durham is around the city centre, while in US college towns such as Ithaca, New York, it is outside the city centre and near the campus.

Two examples of college towns in the US and the UK that have been the subject of academic studies are Ithaca, New York, and Durham, England. These are cities of similar sizes, with the Durham built up area and the Ithaca urban area both having populations between 50,000 and 60,000 in 2021. They both also have major universities founded in the 19th century, with student populations of over 20,000.

Ithaca is a relatively recent foundation, with settlement of the city beginning with a &quot;military tract&quot; designated in 1790 for veterans of the American Revolutionary War. In contrast, Durham is an ancient cathedral city, established in the 10th century. The university was founded by the cathedral in 1832 and is the third oldest in England. Unlike Cornell University in Ithaca, which developed on a campus east of the city centre there, Durham University was mainly based in the city centre, around Palace Green and the Bailey, until the mid 20th century, when it expanded into the Elvet area of the city and the hilly area south of this.

In Ithaca, the two main areas for student residence are Collegetown, to the southwest of the Cornell University campus, and the Greek housing district, to the west of the campus. These were undeveloped when the university opened in 1868. Collegetown developed, similarly to other student rental districts in the US, in response to student demand, with cheap rooming houses and private dormitories being built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Collegetown developed its own central business district, catering to the needs of students. After World War 2, in common with other US universities, Cornell&#x27;s student population increased dramatically, nearly doubling between 1940 and 1965. This drove the further development of Collegetown, with rooming houses becoming apartments and the conversion into student accommodation of many family homes that had been built in the areas furthest from campus. The area also became run down, with a number of proposals for renewal put forward including, in 1969, compete demolition. However, it was not until Cornell invested in Collegetown projects in the 1980s that there was any significant change, with large, student accommodation blocks described as &quot;a cross between dormitories and apartments&quot; replacing the old houses in the area close to campus. However, the areas further away from campus remained large houses subdivided into apartments, and continued increase in the student population pushed the edge of the student rental area west towards the centre of Ithaca and east into Bryant Park.

Until the 1980s almost all students at Durham University lived in colleges rather then accommodation in town, but expansion of the university after this outstripped the growth in college accommodation, leading to many students renting privately in surrounding areas, particularly Elvet and the Viaduct area around the railway viaduct. Unlike Ithaca, where Collegetown was built to accommodate the student population, these areas were already long-established residential districts – Elvet was an ancient borough chartered in the late 12th or early 13th century, with much of the housing converted to student use being former council houses, while the Viaduct area developed during the 19th century as Victorian terraced houses.

From the 1990s onwards, these were increasingly occupied by students, with over 1,800 houses being converted to student rents over a 25 to 30 year period to 2022 and some streets reaching 100 per cent student occupancy. Durham County Council introduced a student housing policy in 2014 and from 2016 required planning permission to convert single family houses to houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), but this was widely regarded as being &quot;too little too late&quot;. The council also encouraged the development of purpose built student accommodation (PBSA) in the city to relieve pressure on the housing market, with the first private PBSA, built by Unite Students opening in Elvet in 2012. Retail premises in the city centre were also converted to private halls of residence. However, demand for HMOs continued to rise, leading to growth in other areas of the city, with Gilesgate in particular seeing large rises in student rents between 2014 and 2022.

This process of large student populations moving into traditionally non-student neighbourhoods, displacing the local population, is known as . It has been a feature of both university towns and university quarters in larger cities in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as university enrolment grew faster than the capacity of universities to expand on-campus housing. It may be perceived as a form of gentrification but can also brings benefits to towns, with student spending boosting local economies across multiple sectors and the student population allowing towns and cities to project a cosmopolitan image in their marketing.

Studentification has mainly been identified in the context of student quarters within larger cities, with the term having been originally coined in 2002 with reference to Leeds in England. However, Durham provides an example of studentification in a smaller college town.

==Town–gown relations==

As in the case of a company town, the large and transient student population may come into conflict with other townspeople. Students may come from outside the area and be from different socio-economic classes than local residents, increasing tensions. The different demographics of the student population can lead to school closures, and the conversion of family homes into houses in multiple occupation can reduce the availability of affordable housing. Economically, the high spending power of the university and of its students in aggregate may inflate the cost of living above that of the region. However, small college towns can also lead to more close-knit academic communities as staff interact frequently outside of work, leading to better work–life balance.

<doc id="877013" wikidata="Q370830" url="?curid=877013" title="Tintin and the Blue Oranges">
<text>Tintin and the Blue Oranges () is a 1964 Franco-Spanish adventure comedy film directed by Philippe Condroyer and starring Jean-Pierre Talbot as Tintin. It was the second live-action film, with an original story based on characters from the comic book series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, written and drawn by the Belgian artist Hergé. The accompanying book version is in photos and text rather than the usual comic-book style.

The term &quot;blue orange&quot; is a moderately popular image among the French, and was originally inspired by Paul Éluard&#x27;s strange quote &quot;Earth is blue like an orange&quot; as a reference to the colour of the fruit when it rots.

The plot revolves around blue oranges, which can grow in desert conditions. They have a bitter and salty taste, which supposedly makes them inedible. Professor Calculus is kidnapped in order to assist another professor in improving the oranges. 

==Plot==

Professor Calculus on (black-and-white) TV broadcasts an appeal to help end world hunger. He receives many letters and parcels, and among them is a blue orange, which can grow in desert conditions (and glows in the dark) from Professor Zalamea, but no letter of explanation. That night, two thieves break into Marlinspike Hall and steal the blue orange. With no other choice, Calculus, with Tintin, the Captain, and Snowy, go to Valencia (filmed in Burjassot, in Simat de la Valldigna at the Monastery of Santa María de la Valldigna, Gandia and Xàtiva).

Arriving, they find that Zalamea is not present at his hacienda. They are met instead by his cousin. Professor Calculus is kidnapped to help Zalamea perfect the blue oranges, which with neutron bombardment can mature in just five days, but they taste bitter and salty, making them inedible.

Tintin befriends a local boy, who takes him to his gang hideout and he finds out that a boy who was to take the parcel to the post office for Zalamea was attacked by a man with a blue dragon tattoo on his hand. Thomson and Thompson turn up from Interpol, investigating Zalamea&#x27;s disappearance, and have an unfortunate incident with a bull.

The local boys find Fernando, the man with the tattoo, and Tintin and the Captain go to his hotel. Tintin picks the lock and gets into his room, and when Fernando returns, overhears him talking on a radio set to his chief, about a&quot; rendez-vous&quot;. Tintin and the Captain follow Fernando, but are knocked unconscious and taken away.

Thomson and Thompson check into a hotel, but are tricked by the villains, who use doubles to coax them from their rooms. Tintin and the Captain revive and find themselves in a grain silo, but are rescued by Snowy dropping a rope into it. Back in town, they find themselves pursued by the police, who chase them all around a market. Tintin and Haddock escape thanks to Bianca Castafiore. After an unexpected visit by a delegation from the visiting Emir of Sakali, Tintin and Haddock meet up again with their young friends. They decide to sneak back into Professor Zalamea&#x27;s hacienda to test some new information, that is, the role of Estensoro (Zalamea&#x27;s manservant) in the kidnapping. After successfully using animals with pans tied to their tails as a distraction, Tintin and Haddock find a radio identical to Fernando&#x27;s in Estensoro&#x27;s room, proving his involvement. Haddock&#x27;s decision to drink Estensoro&#x27;s whisky accidentally leads them to discover Zalamea&#x27;s secret documents, and his own suspicions about the identity of his enemies.

Back at the villains&#x27; hideout, the professors manage to make a broadcast describing their whereabouts. Estensoro hears the broadcast and races off to inform his boss. Luckily, Tintin and Haddock also hear the broadcast and set off in hot pursuit. After a brief struggle, Estensoro is overcome, but the professors are nowhere to be found. The new kidnappers evidently had no use for the Thom(p)son twins, as they are discovered still tied up (much to the Captain&#x27;s enjoyment). Snowy discovers an &quot;agal&quot; belonging to one of the Arab kidnappers, and Tintin realises that the rich Emir of Sakali (who had courted Bianca Castafiore earlier in the film) was the same man as the Arab enemy described by Professor Zalamea.

The rich Emir of Sakali&#x27;s yacht is moored up at the docks, so Tintin and the Captain try to rescue the professors, but they have been drugged, and their loud voices raise the alarm, and Tintin and Haddock are caught by the emir. They escape and a fight ensues, as a horde of children turn up (warned by Snowy). The villains are thrown in the sea, the emir is subdued, and the police arrive to clean things up.

All turns out well and they are back at Marlinspike Hall for a celebration and photos. It is said that they hope to perfect the oranges within 10 years and also to learn to grow wheat, potatoes, eggplants, etc. in the desert. Just then, Thomson and Thompson turn up in their car, crash, and end up in the fountain, to the amusement of all. Greedy dogs eat a &quot;THE END&quot; sign.
