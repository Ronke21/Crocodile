<text>Marion Gibbons (née Chesney; 10 June 1936 – 30/31 December 2019) was a Scottish writer of romance and mystery novels, whose career as a published author began in 1979. She wrote numerous successful historical romance novels under a form of her maiden name, Marion Chesney, including the &quot;Travelling Matchmaker&quot; and &quot;Daughters of Mannerling&quot; series.

Using the pseudonym M. C. Beaton, she also wrote many popular mystery novels, most notably the Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth mystery series. Both of these book series have been adapted for TV. She also wrote romance novels under the pseudonyms Ann Fairfax, Jennie Tremaine, Helen Crampton, Charlotte Ward, and Sarah Chester.

Writing as Marion Chesney, her final endeavour was an Edwardian mystery series featuring Lady Rose Summer, a charming debutante with an independent streak, and Captain Harry Cathcart, an impoverished aristocrat. In an interview, she stated that she ceased writing the Edwardian series as a result of the pressure of writing for the Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth series.

==Biography==
Marion Chesney was born on 10 June 1936 in Glasgow, Scotland, and worked as a buyer of fiction for the Glasgow bookshop, John Smith &amp; Son, before working at the &quot;Scottish Daily Express&quot; as a theatre critic, newspaper reporter, and editor. She married Express Middle East Correspondent Harry Scott Gibbons in 1969; they had a son, Charles. The couple moved to the Cotswolds when their son was about to go to university, assuming that he would go to Oxford, though in fact he did not.

Chesney had also lived in the USA. In later life, she divided her time between a cottage in the Cotswolds and Paris. She died at a hospital in Gloucester, England on 30 December 2019, at the age of 83.

Little Brown, Chesney&#x27;s publisher at the time of her death, announced that before the author became ill, she continued to write and was working on new material for her beloved characters, Hamish Macbeth and Agatha Raisin.

<doc id="891633" wikidata="Q5455603" url="?curid=891633" title="Fitzgerald Inquiry">
<text>The Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct (the Fitzgerald Inquiry; 1987–1989) into Queensland Police corruption was a judicial inquiry presided over by Tony Fitzgerald QC. The inquiry resulted in the resignation of Queensland&#x27;s premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the calling of two by-elections, and the jailing of three former ministers and the Police Commissioner Terry Lewis (who also lost his knighthood). It also contributed to the end of the National Party of Australia&#x27;s 32-year run as the governing political party in Queensland.

==History==
The inquiry was established in response to a series of articles by reporter Phil Dickie in &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; about high-level police corruption, followed by a &quot;Four Corners&quot; television report on the same issue by Chris Masters, entitled &quot;The Moonlight State&quot;, which aired on 11 May 1987. Both investigations dealt with illegal prostitution and gambling aided by police corruption. With Queensland&#x27;s Premier of 18 years, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, out of the state, his deputy, Bill Gunn, ordered a commission of inquiry the day after the television report was broadcast.

The allegations aired in the media were not new. They had surfaced from time to time and some news organisations had been forced to pay damages to aggrieved people who alleged their reputations had been damaged (Bjelke-Petersen himself was notoriously litigious in response to unfavourable press coverage). The government was reported to have initially preferred District Court Judge Eric Pratt, chair of the controversial Police Complaints Tribunal and a close friend of Police Commissioner Lewis, to head the inquiry, which led to fears by journalists that it would be a whitewash. After consulting the legal profession, Attorney-General Paul Clauson opposed Pratt as unsuitable and he was removed from consideration.

The government then approached Ian Callinan to head the inquiry, but he refused on the basis that he was perceived to be too close to the government. Callinan recommended Fitzgerald as a suitable head. He also drafted the terms of reference for the inquiry and represented the Queensland Government before it. While the terms of reference were initially narrow, restricted only to the specific allegations raised against specific persons named in the media over a period of just five years, Fitzgerald used his moral authority to expand the inquiry to examine any relevant matter. As a result, the terms of reference of the Commission were extended twice.

That enabled Fitzgerald to set a precedent for commissions of inquiry and Royal Commissions in Australia generally, using innovative methods, such as indemnities from prosecution for key witnesses, to secure vital evidence. He began formal hearings on 27 July 1987. The inquiry was initially expected to last about six weeks; it instead spent almost two years conducting a comprehensive investigation of long-term, systemic political corruption and abuse of power in Queensland. Public sittings were held on 238 days, hearing testimony from 339 witnesses.

On 28 August, a Licensing Branch sergeant, Harry Burgess confessed to corruption, and implicated Jack Herbert, and assistant commissioner Graeme Parker. In turn, Parker implicated police commissioner Terry Lewis on 16 September.

The inquiry eventually outlived the Bjelke-Petersen government. Mike Ahern became the new Premier after Bjelke-Petersen was deposed by his own party. Evidence revealed by the investigation, including testimony from Bjelke-Petersen himself, caused significant political damage and led to a power struggle within the National Party. Bjelke-Petersen resigned as Premier after an unsuccessful attempt to have the Governor of Queensland sack all of his ministers after they had deposed him as party leader.

The inquiry&#x27;s special prosecutor was Doug Drummond QC. It was Drummond who decided not to retry Bjelke-Petersen after a hung jury had failed to convict him of corruption and perjury.

==Findings==
Fitzgerald&#x27;s report was submitted on 3 July 1989. As a result, a number of high-profile politicians were charged with crimes, and Queensland Police Commissioner Terry Lewis was charged with corruption.

Bjelke-Petersen himself was put on trial for perjury in respect of evidence he gave to the inquiry. The jury in the case was deadlocked, bringing about a mistrial. In 1992, it was revealed that the jury foreman, Luke Shaw, was a member of the Young Nationals, was identified with the &quot;Friends of Joh&quot; movement, and had misrepresented the state of deliberations to the judge. According to an ABC TV analysis, &quot;A later inquiry conducted by Justice Bill Carter found the selection process had been manipulated by ... ex-police officers ... helping to put Joh before a jury led by Young Nationals member, Luke Shaw&quot;. A special prosecutor announced in 1992 there would be no retrial because Sir Joh, then aged 81, was too old.

Jack Herbert had been the bagman, collecting bribes for police commissioner Terry Lewis from 1980. Lewis himself had been a bagman for former commissioner Francis Bischof. Lewis was convicted (and subsequently stripped of his knighthood).

Leisha Harvey, a former health minister, was charged with misappropriating of public funds as part of an investigation resulting from the findings of the inquiry. She spent one year in jail. Don Lane, a former transport minister, was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for falsifying expense accounts. Lane&#x27;s resignation resulted in the 1989 Merthyr state by-election. Brian Austin, another former health minister, was convicted of misappropriating public funds. Geoff Muntz was convicted of misappropriation of ministerial expense funds. The resignation of senior minister Russell Hinze, after damaging allegations were made against him during the inquiry, led to the 1988 South Coast state by-election.

The Queensland Police Special Bureau was formed on 30 July 1940 and renamed Special Branch on 7 April 1948. It was criticised for being used for political purposes by the Bjelke-Petersen government in the 1970s and 1980s, for example, enforcing laws against protests, sometimes outnumbering the protesters or using provocateurs to incite violence so the protesters could be arrested, and investigating and harassing political opponents. Following a recommendation by the Fitzgerald Inquiry, the Special Branch was disbanded in 1989, having destroyed its records before Fitzgerald could subpoena them.

In large part due to public anger over the revelations in the Fitzgerald report, the National Party was decisively defeated in the December 1989 state election, which brought the Australian Labor Party to power for the first time since 1957.

===Recommendations===
The two most significant recommendations were the establishment of the Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) and the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission which was to review electoral boundaries. The need for Freedom of Information legislation in the state was noted, as was the need to review laws relating to public assembly and guidelines for the disclosure of pecuniary interests of parliamentarians. The CJC was to be responsible for investigating specific individuals mentioned during the inquiry.

The police culture of the state was also criticised. Aspects such as loyalty to fellow police officers, police not enforcing laws against other police, and failure to listen to whistle-blowers, were condemned because they led to misconduct, inefficiency and contempt for the justice system. Many of the inquiry&#x27;s recommendations were implemented by Wayne Goss, the first Labor Party Premier of Queensland in 32 years.

==Cultural depictions==
The investigation leading up to the inquiry and the inquiry itself were depicted in the 1989 TV movie &quot;Police State&quot; by Chris Noonan.

Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s trial was later the subject of a TV movie, &quot;Joh&#x27;s Jury&quot;.

Margot Hutcheson painted a picture of the inquiry, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t the Fitzgerald Inquiry Fun?&quot;

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Fitzgerald Inquiry was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Defining Moment&quot;.

Folk singer John Dengate wrote the satirical song &quot;The Queensland Policeman&quot; about the inquiry.

<text>The Mexico City Metro () is a rapid transit system that serves the metropolitan area of Mexico City, including some municipalities in the State of Mexico. Operated by the Sistema de Transporte Colectivo (STC), it is the second largest metro system in North America after the New York City Subway.

The inaugural STC Metro line was long, serving 16 stations, and opened to the public on 4 September 1969. The system has expanded since then in a series of fits and starts. , the system has 12 lines, serving 195 stations, and of route. Ten of the lines are rubber-tired. Instead of traditional steel wheels, they use pneumatic traction, which is quieter and rides smoother in Mexico City&#x27;s unstable soils. The system survived the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.

Of the STC Metro&#x27;s 195 stations, 44 serve two or more lines (&quot;correspondencias&quot; or transfer stations). Many stations are named for historical figures, places, or events in Mexican history. It has 115 underground stations (the deepest of which are below street level); 54 surface stations and 26 elevated stations. All lines operate from 5 a.m. to midnight. At the end of 2007, the Federal District government announced the construction of the most recent STC Metro line, Line 12, which was built to run approximately towards the southeastern part of the city, connecting with Lines 7, 3, 2 and 8. This line opened on 30 October 2012.

== History ==
=== Concept of the Metro and early plans ===
By the second half of the twentieth century, Mexico City had serious public transport issues, with congested main roads and highways, especially in the downtown zone, where 40 percent of the daily trips in the city were concentrated. 65 of the 91 lines of bus and electric transport served this area. With four thousand units in addition to 150,000 personal automobile peak hours, the average speed was less than walking pace.

The principal promoter of the construction of the Mexico City Metro was engineer Bernardo Quintana, who was in charge of the construction company Ingenieros Civiles y Asociados (Civil Engineers and Associates). He carried out a series of studies that resulted in a draft plan which would ultimately lead to the construction of the Mexico City Metro. This plan was shown to different authorities of Mexico City but it was not made official until 29 April 1967, when the Government Gazette (&quot;Diario Oficial de la Federación&quot;) published the presidential decree that created a public decentralized organism, the &quot;Sistema de Transporte Colectivo&quot;, with the proposal to build, operate and run an underground rapid transit network as part of Mexico City&#x27;s public transport system.

The Mexico City Metro benefited from a great amount of technical assistance made available by France. RATP&#x27;s engineering branch SOFRETU played a major role in its initial planning and the design of the first lines, hence the choice of tyre/rail technology.

On 19 June 1967, at the crossroads of Chapultepec Avenue with Avenida Bucareli, the inauguration ceremony for the Mexico City Metro took place. Two years later, on 4 September 1969, an orange train made the inaugural trip between Zaragoza and Insurgentes stations, thus beginning daily operation up to today.


=== First stage (1967–1972) ===
The first stage of construction comprised the construction, done by Grupo ICA, and inauguration of lines 1, 2 and 3. This stage involved engineers, geologists, mechanics, civil engineers, chemists, hydraulic and sanitation workers, electricians, archaeologists, and biologists; specialists in ventilation, statistics, computation, and in traffic and transit; accountants, economists, lawyers, workers and laborers. Between 1,200 and 4,000 specialists and 48,000 workers participated, building at least of track per month, the fastest rate of construction ever for a subway.

During this stage of construction workers uncovered two archaeological ruins, one Aztec idol, and the bones of a mammoth (on display at Talismán station).

By the end of the first stage, namely on 10 June 1972, the STC Metro had 48 stations and a total length of : Line 1 ran from Observatorio to Zaragoza, Line 2 from Tacuba southwest to Tasqueña and line 3 from Tlatelolco to Hospital General in the south, providing quick access to the General Hospital of Mexico.

=== Second stage (1977–1982) ===
No further progress was reached during President Luis Echeverría&#x27;s government, but during José López Portillo&#x27;s administration, a second stage began. The &quot;Comisión Ejecutiva del Metro&quot; (Executive Technical Commission of Mexico City Metro) was created in order to be in charge of expanding the STC Metro within the metropolitan area of Mexico City.

Works began with the expansion of Line 3 towards the north from Tlatelolco to La Raza in 1978 and to the current terminal Indios Verdes in 1979, and towards the south from Hospital General to Centro Médico in 1980 and to Zapata months later. Construction of lines 4 and 5 was begun and completed on 26 May – 30 August 1982, respectively; the former from Martín Carrera to Santa Anita and the latter from Politécnico to Pantitlán. Line 4 was the first STC Metro line built as an elevated track, owing to the lower density of big buildings.

=== Third stage (1983–1985), and the 1985 earthquake ===
This construction stage took place from the beginning of 1983 through the end of 1985. Lines 1, 2 and 3 were expanded to their current lengths, and new lines 6 and 7 were built. The length of the network was increased by and the number of stations to 105.

Line 3&#x27;s route was expanded from Zapata station to Universidad station on 30 August 1983. Line 1 was expanded from Zaragoza to the current terminal Pantitlán, and line 2 from Tacuba to the current terminal Cuatro Caminos. These last two were both inaugurated on 22 August 1984.

Line 6&#x27;s route first ran from El Rosario to Instituto del Petróleo; Line 7 was opened from Tacuba to Barranca del Muerto and runs along the foot of the Sierra de las Cruces mountain range that surrounds the Valley of Mexico at its west side, outside of the ancient lake zone. This made it possible for Line 7 to be built as a deep-bore tunnel.

On the morning of 19 September 1985, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck Mexico City. Many buildings as well as streets were left with major damage making transportation on the ground difficult, but the STC Metro was not damaged because a rectangular structure had been used instead of arches, making it resistant to earthquakes, thus proving to be a safe means of transportation in a time of crisis. 

On the day of the quake, the Metro stopped service and completely shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people to get out of the tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try to get where they were going. At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was no service in stations Merced, Pino Suárez, Isabel la Católica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauhtémoc. On Line 2, there was no service between stations Bellas Artes and Tasqueña. On Line 3 only Juárez and Balderas were closed. Line 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Suárez. These stations were located above the ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, but rather because of surface rescue work and clearing of debris.

=== Fourth stage (1985–1987) ===
Fourth stage saw the completion of Line 6 from Instituto del Petróleo to its eastern terminal Martín Carrera and Line 7 to the north from Tacuba to El Rosario. Line 9 was the only new line built during this stage. It originally ran from Pantitlán to Centro Médico, and its expansion to Tacubaya was completed on 29 August 1988. For Line 9, a circular deep-bore tunnel and an elevated track were used.

===Fifth stage (1988–1994)===
For the first time, a service line of the Mexico City Metro ran into the State of Mexico: planned as one of more &quot;líneas alimentadoras&quot; (feeder lines to be named by letters, instead of numbers), line A was fully operational by its first inauguration on 12 August 1991. It runs from Pantitlán to La Paz, located in the municipality of the same name. This line was built almost entirely above ground, and to reduce the cost of maintenance, steel railway tracks and overhead lines were used instead of pneumatic traction, promoting the name &quot;metro férreo&quot; (steel-rail metro) as opposed to the previous eight lines that used pneumatic traction.

The draft for Line 8 planned a &quot;correspondencia&quot; (transfer station) in Zócalo, namely the exact center of the city, but it was canceled due to possible damage to the colonial buildings and the Aztec ruins, so it was replanned and now it runs from Garibaldi, which is still downtown, to Constitución de 1917 in the southeast of the city. The construction of line 8 began in 1988 and was completed in 1994.

With this, the length of the network increased , adding two lines and 29 more stations, giving the metro network at that point a total of , 154 stations and 10 lines.

=== Sixth stage (1994–2000) ===
Assessment for line B began in late 1993. Line B was intended as a second &quot;línea alimentadora&quot; for northeastern municipalities in the State of Mexico, but, unlike line A, it used pneumatic traction. Construction of the subterranean track between Buenavista (named after the old Buenavista train station) and Garibaldi began in October 1994.
Line B was opened to the public in two stages: from Buenavista to Villa de Aragón on 15 December 1999, and from Villa de Aragón to Ciudad Azteca on 30 November 2000.

=== Seventh stage (2008–2014) ===
Plans for a new STC Metro line started in 2008, although previous surveys and assessments were made as early as 2000. Line 12&#x27;s first service stage was planned for completion in late 2009 with the creation of track connecting Axomulco, a planned new transfer station for Line 8 (between Escuadrón 201 and Atlalilco) to Tláhuac. The second stage, connecting Mixcoac to Tláhuac, was to be completed in 2010.

Construction of Line 12 started in 2008, assuring it would be opened by 2011. Nevertheless, completion was delayed until 2012. Free test rides were offered to the public in some stations, and the line was fully operational on 30 October 2012. With minor changes, Line 12 runs from Mixcoac to Tláhuac, serving southern Mexico City for the first time. At long, it is the longest line in the system.

Line 12 differs from previous lines in several aspects: no hawkers are allowed, either inside the train or inside the stations; it is the first numbered line to use steel railway tracks; one must have a Tarjeta DF smart card to access any station since Metro tickets are no longer accepted.

In the book &quot;Los hombres del Metro&quot;, the original planning of Line 12 is described; although it was to begin at Mixcoac as it does today, Atlalilco and Constitución de 1917 stations of Line 8 were to be part of Line 12. The same map shows that Line 8 would have reached the Villa Coapa area and that it would not have had a terminal at Garibaldi, but at Indios Verdes, linking with Line 3. In addition, the book shows that Line 7 would have terminated at San Jerónimo. None of these plans have been confirmed by the Mexico City government.

In 2015, mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera announced the construction of two more stations and a terminal for Line 12: Valentín Campa, Álvaro Obregón and Observatorio, both west of Mixcoac. With this, Line 12 is to be connected to Line 1, providing new metro access to the Observatorio zone, which will become the terminal for the intercity train between Mexico City and Toluca.

===Archaeological finds===
The metro system&#x27;s construction has resulted in more than 20 thousand archeological finds, from various time periods in the history of the indigenous people. The excavations needed to make way for the rails gave opportunities to find artifacts from different periods of the region&#x27;s inhabitants, in areas that are now densely urbanized. Objects and small structures were found, with origins spanning from prehistoric times to the 20th century. Some examples of artifacts preserved by the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia de México (INAH)) are: parts of pyramids (like an altar to the Mexica god &quot;Ehecatl&quot;), a sculpture of the goddess Coatlicue, and remains of a mammoth. The altar to Ehécatl is now in Pino Suárez station, between lines 1 and 2, and is called by the INAH the smallest archeological site in Mexico. The metro has led to a large quantity of archeological finds, and has also let archaeologists understand more about the pattern of ancient civilisations in the Mexican capital by analysing its underground from various time periods.

===Architecture===
Distinguished architects were hired to design and construct the stations on the first metro line, such as Enrique del Moral, Félix Candela, Salvador Ortega and Luis Barragán. Examples of Candela&#x27;s work can be seen in San Lázaro, Candelaria, and Merced stations on Line 1.

=== Cultural references ===
The Metro has figured in Mexico&#x27;s cultural history, as the inspiration for a musical composition for strings, &quot;Metro Chabacano&quot; and Rodrigo &quot;Rockdrigo&quot; González&#x27;s 1982 song, &quot;Metro Balderas&quot;. It was also a filming location for the 1990 Hollywood movie &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Public intellectual Carlos Monsiváis has commented on the cultural importance of the Metro, &quot;a space for collective expression, where diverse social sectors are compelled to mingle every day&quot;.

==Lines, stations, names, colors, and logos==


Each line offers one service only, and to each line, a number (letter if feeding line) and color are assigned. Every assigned color is present on square-shaped station logos, system maps and street signs, and neither colors nor numbers/letters have been changed. Line B is the only exception to the color assignment, as green (upper half) and gray (lower half) are used, producing thus bicolor logos and signs. Gray only may be used to avoid confusion with line 8, which uses a similar green.

The names of metro stations are often historical in nature, highlighting people, places, and events in Mexican history. There are stations commemorating aspects of the Mexican Revolution and the revolutionary era. When it opened in 1969 with line 1 (the &quot;Pink Line&quot;), two stations alluded to the Revolution. Most directly referencing the Revolution was Pino Suárez, named after Francisco I. Madero&#x27;s vice president, who was murdered with him in February 1913. The other was Balderas, whose icon is a cannon, alluding to the Ciudadela armory where the coup against Madero was launched. In 1970, Revolución opened, with the station at the Monument to the Revolution. As the Metro expanded, further stations with names from the revolutionary era opened. In 1980, two popular heroes of the Revolution were honored, with Zapata explicitly commemorating the peasant revolutionary from Morelos. A sideways commemoration was División del Norte, named after the Army that Pancho Villa commanded until its demise in the Battle of Celaya in 1915.

The year 1987 saw the opening of the Lázaro Cárdenas station. In 1988, Aquiles Sedán honors the first martyr of the Revolution. In 1994, Constitución de 1917 opened, as did Garibaldi, named after the grandson of Italian fighter for independence, Giuseppe Garibaldi. The grandson had been a participant in the Mexican Revolution. In 1999, the radical anarchist Ricardo Flores Magón was honored with the station of the same name. Also opening in 1999 was Romero Rubio, named after the leader of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s &quot;Científicos&quot;, whose daughter, Carmen Romero Rubio, became Díaz&#x27;s second wife. In 2012, a new Metro line opened with an Hospital 20 de Noviembre stop, a hospital named after the date that Francisco I. Madero in his 1910 Plan de San Luis Potosí called for rebellion against Díaz. There are no Metro stops named for Madero, Carranza, Obregón, or Calles, and only an oblique reference to Villa in Metro División del Norte.

Each station is identified by a minimalist logo, first designed by Lance Wyman, who had also designed the logo for the 1968 Mexico Olympics. Logos are generally related to the name of the station or the area around it. At the time of Line 1&#x27;s opening, Mexico&#x27;s illiteracy rate was high. As of 1960, 38% of Mexicans over the age of five were illiterate and only 5.6% of Mexicans had completed elementary school. Since one-third of the Mexican population could not read or write and most of the rest had not completed high school, it was thought that patrons would find it easier to guide themselves with a system based on colors and visual signs.

The logos are not assigned at random; rather, they are designated by considering the surrounding areas, such as:
* The reference places that are located around the stations (e.g., the logo for Salto del Agua fountain depicts a fountain).
* The topology of an area (e.g., Coyoacán—in Nahuatl &quot;place of coyotes&quot;—depicts a coyote).
* The history of the place (e.g., Juárez, named after President Benito Juárez, depicts his silhouette).

The logos&#x27; background colors reflect those of the line the station serves. Stations serving two or more lines show the respective colors of each line in diagonal stripes, as in Salto del Agua. This system was adopted for the Guadalajara and Monterrey metros, and for the Mexico City Metrobús. Although logos are no longer necessary due to literacy being now widespread, their usage has remained.

==Transfers to other systems==

The Mexico City Metro offers in and out-street transfers to four major rapid transit systems: the Mexico City Metrobús and State of Mexico Mexibús bus rapid transit systems, the Mexico City light rail system and the Ferrocarril Suburbano (FSZMVM) commuter rail. None of these are part of the Sistema de Transporte Colectivo network and an extra fare must be paid for access.

Metrobús line 1 was inaugurated in 2005. According to the 1985 STC Metro Master Plan, Metrobús Line 1 roughly follows the route planned for STC Metro Line 15 by 2010, which was never built. Every transfer is out-of-station, but the same smart card may be used for payment. All five lines (Line 5 to be built during 2013) offer a connection to at least one STC Metro station. STC Metro stations that connect to Metrobús lines include Indios Verdes, La Raza, Chilpancingo, Balderas, Etiopía / Plaza de la Transparencia, Insurgentes Sur and others.

The sole light rail line running from Tasqueña to Xochimilco is operated by the Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos and is better known as Tren Ligero. Line 2 terminal Tasqueña offers an in-station transfer, but an extra ticket must be purchased.

In 2008, the Ferrocarril Suburbano commuter rail, commonly known as Suburbano, was inaugurated with a sole line running from Cuatitlán to Buenavista as of 2013. STC Metro offers two in-station transfers: Line B terminal Buenavista to the Suburbano terminal of the same name, and Line 6 station Ferrería / Arena Ciudad de México into Suburbano station Fortuna. An extra fare must be paid, and a Ferrocarril Suburbano smart card is required for access.

Another commuter rail, Tren Interurbano de Pasajeros Toluca-Valle de México is estimated to be completed in 2023. This line will connect Observatorio station in Mexico City with Toluca.

==Fares and pay systems==
Previously, a single ticket of MXN $5.00, allowed a rider one trip anywhere within the system with unlimited transfers. A discounted rate of MXN $3.00 is available upon application for women head of households, the unemployed, and students with scarce resources.
Mexico City Metro offers free service to the elderly, the physically impaired, and children under the age of 5 (accompanied by an adult). Tickets could be purchased at booths (except on Line 12). They were made of paper and had a magnetic strip on them, and were recycled upon being inserted into a turnstile. As of February 2024, tickets have been discontinued and riders must obtain a rechargeable card.
Until 2009, a STC Metro ticket cost MXN $2.00 (€ 0.10, or US$ 0.15 in 2009); one purchased ticket allowed unlimited distance travel and transfer at any given time for one day, making the Mexico City Metro one of the cheapest rail systems in the world. Only line A&#x27;s transfer in Pantitlán required a second payment before 13 December 2013. In January 2010, the price rose to MXN $3.00 (€ 0.15, or US$ 0.24), a fare that remained until 13 December 2013; a 2009 survey showed that 93% of citizens approved of the increase, while some said they would be willing to pay even more if needed.

STC Metro rechargeable cards were first available for an initial cost of MXN $10.00. The card would be recharged at the ticket counter in any station (or at machines in some Metro stations) to a maximum of MXN $120.00 (around € 6.44, or US$ 7.05 in 2015) for 24 trips.

In an attempt to modernize public transport, in October 2012, the Mexico City government implemented the use of a prepaid fare card, or stored-value card, called &quot;Tarjeta DF&quot; (Tarjeta del Distrito Federal, literally Federal District Card) as a payment method for STC Metro, Metrobús and the city&#x27;s trolleybus and light rail systems, though they are all managed by different organizations. Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos manages both the Xochimilco Light Rail line and the city&#x27;s trolleybus system. Previous fare cards that were valid only on STC Metro or Metrobús remained valid for the system for which they were acquired.

==Rolling stock==
As of April 2012, 14 types of standard gauge rolling stock totalling a number of 355 trains running in 6-or 9-car formation are currently in use on the Mexico City Metro. Most of the stock is rapid transit type, with the exception of the Line A stock, which is light metro. Four manufacturers have provided rolling stock for the Mexico City Metro, namely the French Alstom (MP-68, NM-73, NM-79), Canadian Bombardier (FM-95A and NM-02), Spanish CAF (NM-02, FE-07, FE-10 and NM-16 and Mexican Concarril (NM-83 and FM-86) (now Bombardier Transportation Mexico, in some train types with the help of Alstom and/or Bombardier).

The maximum design speed limit is (average speed ) for rubber-tired rolling stock and (average speed ) for steel-wheeled rolling stock. Forced-air ventilation is employed and the top portion of windows can be opened so that passenger comfort is enhanced by the combination of these two types of ventilation. Like the rolling stock used in the Paris Métro and the Montreal Metro, the numbering of the Mexico City Metro&#x27;s rolling stock are specified by year of design (not year of first use).

In chronological order, the types of rubber-tired rolling stock are: MP-68, NM-73A, NM-73B, NM-73C, NM-79, MP-82, NC-82, NM-83A, NM-83B, NE-92, NM-02, NM-16 and NM-22; and the types of steel-wheeled rolling stock are: FM-86, FM-95A, FE-07, and FE-10.

From May 2024, Line 1 will receive 29 new rubber-tired trains manufactured by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive in China, replacing earlier rolling stock. This is in line with ongoing upgrading works for Line 1, including the installation of CBTC.

==Major incidents==

On 20 October 1975, two trains crashed in Viaducto station while both were going towards Tasqueña station. The first was stopped picking up passengers when it was hit by another train that did not stop in time. According to official reports, from 31 to 39 people died, and between 71 and 119 were injured. After the crash, automatic signals were incorporated to all lines.

On 18 September 2009, a man was vandalizing the walls of Balderas station with a marker before being confronted by a police officer. He took out a gun and killed the officer and a construction worker who tried to disarm him, and injured 5 others.

On 4 May 2015, two trains heading towards Politécnico station on Line 5 crashed in Oceanía station. The first was leaving to Aragón station and was requested to stop and wait, while the second did not deactivate the autopilot and crashed into it at the end of the platform. 12 people were injured.

On 10 March 2020, two trains heading towards Observatorio station on Line 1 crashed in Tacubaya station. The first train was parked at the platform when it was hit by another train that was coming in reverse. 1 person died and 41 were injured, all inside the second train, as people in the parked train had been evacuated moments before the crash.

On 9 January 2021, the Central Control Center serving lines 1 to 6 caught fire. During the fire, a female police officer was killed due to a fall in the building. All the stations on those lines temporarily remained closed and provisional transport service was provided by city buses and police vehicles. According to the Metro authorities, the service in lines 4, 5, and 6 would be normalized in days, while that in lines 1, 2, and 3 in several months.

On 3 May 2021, a train was traveling on Line 12 between the Olivos and Tezonco stations when a girder supporting the overpass on which the train was traveling collapsed, killing 26 and injuring more than 70. Service on Line 12 was later suspended, while STC warned residents to avoid the site of the collapse.

On 7 January 2023 at 09:16 local time, two trains collided between Potrero and La Raza stations on Line 3, killing one and injuring 57. In addition to other minor events, city officials said that this accident was a result of sabotage to the Fourth Transformation platform to affect the image of Claudia Sheinbaum, then mayor of the city and a potential candidate on the 2024 Mexican general election.

<text>Henck Alphonsus Eugène Arron (25 April 1936 – 4 December 2000) was a Surinamese politician who served as the first Prime Minister of Suriname after it gained independence in 1975. A member of the National Party of Suriname, he served from 24 December 1973 with the transition government, to 25 February 1980. He was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état by the military, led by Dési Bouterse. Released in 1981 after charges of corruption were dropped, he returned to banking, his previous career. In 1987, Arron was elected as Vice President of Suriname and served until another coup in 1990 overthrew the government.

== Biography ==
Arron was born in Paramaribo in 1936. He completed high school in 1956, and moved to the Netherlands to study banking. Arron worked several years at the Amsterdamsche Bank. On return to Suriname, he became staff member at the Vervuurts Bank (current name Hakrinbank). In late 1963, he became deputy director of the Volkskredietbank (People&#x27;s Credit Union).

In 1961, Arron became a member of the National Party of Suriname (NPS), the main Creole party. In 1970, Arron was chosen as the Chairman of the NPS. In 1973, he created a coalition which included the pro-independence Nationalist Republican Party (PNR), that won that year&#x27;s general election. On 24 December 1973, Arron became prime minister, and lead the final negotiation for the independence of Suriname. The NPS found an ally in the Dutch PvdA who wanted independence as soon as possible. In February 1974, Arron announced that Suriname would be seeking independence before the end of 1975. Many observers were surprised, as Arron&#x27;s NPS did not have a majority in favour of independence.

The Netherlands granted Suriname independence on 25 November 1975. The independence was marked by social unrest, economic depression, and rumours of corruption. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term. During the first years of independence about one-third of the population emigrated to the Netherlands.

The hastily created Suriname National Army had many non-commissioned officers who tried to unionise complaining about corruption, and poor pay. Arron refused to recognise them, and arrested the ringleaders who were to go to trial on 26 February 1980. Also, elections were planned for March of that year. On 25 February, Arron was overthrown and jailed in a coup by the military led by Dési Bouterse. In 1981, Arron was released under house arrest. A year later, he was selected as managing director of the Surinamese People&#x27;s Credit Bank.

In 1987, the United Nations, Netherlands, France, and United States pressured the military government to negotiate, and Suriname saw a return to democracy. That year Arron was elected as Vice President of Suriname (and therefore Chairman of the Council of Ministers), serving from 26 January 1988 to 24 December 1990. Ramsewak Shankar was elected as president. Their government was overthrown in 1990 in another coup by Bouterse and the military.

In December 2000, Arron was invited by the Royal Tropical Institute to the Netherlands to talk about 25 years of Surinamese independence. On the evening of 4 December, he died at the home of his brother as a result of cardiac arrest.

<doc id="891652" wikidata="Q7628981" url="?curid=891652" title="Sturgeon Bay">
<text>Sturgeon Bay is an arm of Green Bay extending southeastward approximately 10 miles into the Door Peninsula at the city of Sturgeon Bay, located approximately halfway up the Door Peninsula. The bay is connected to Lake Michigan by the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal. The Potawatomi name for Sturgeon Bay is &quot;Na-ma-we-qui-tong&quot;.

== Origin ==
The bay seems to represent the pre-glacial path of the Menominee River, with the valley deepened by glacial carving and then submerged into rising lakewaters.

== Bridges ==
Three bridges cross the bay, including the historic Sturgeon Bay Bridge, and the recently finished Oregon Street Bridge.

== Fish ==
Sturgeon Bay and Little Sturgeon (just to the south of Sturgeon Bay) are considered biodiversity hotspots because they support a large number of different fish species.

Researchers collected viral hemorrhagic septicemia viruses from 184 different fish from 2003 to 2017. Two were found from 2007 to 2010 infecting smallmouth bass within Sturgeon Bay. Each of them was a different variant of a type not found in the middle or lower Great Lakes.

== Mayflies ==
In June 2016, an estimated several thousand mayflies hatched in Sawyer Bay (within Sturgeon Bay). This was the result of an experiment to stock millions of eggs from the species &quot;Hexagenia limbata&quot; and &quot;Hexagenia bilineata&quot; in the lower Green Bay area in an attempt to reintroduce the species. The last mayfly from the genus &quot;Hexagenia&quot; had been collected in the lower Green Bay area in 1955. As mayfly populations can be unstable and not all stocking locations appeared to be successful, as of 2017 it was not yet known whether it would be possible for populations of &quot;Hexagenia&quot; mayflies to become self-sustaining.

== MACHI Entertainment ==
MACHI Entertainment is one of the largest Asian hip hop/rap record labels. It was founded in Taiwan by super music producer Jae Chong and business partners Jeffrey Huang and Bobby Sheng. The label is independent of Warner Music Taiwan. As a member of the group SOLID, Jae Chong sold millions of records in Korea and later became one of the most prolific music producers in Asia with more than 50 million albums sold all over the world. He partnered with Jeffrey Huang and Bobby Sheng who founded TheOne Technology Group back when they were still based in Los Angeles. TheOne Technology Group specialized in bridging the cultural and language barriers for Internet-based projects. Together, they acquired a stellar clientele list including IBM, Nike and Hewlett-Packard. In 2000 they orchestrated a $60,000,000, three-company merger that combined TheOne Technology group and Dynalab with DynaComware.

<doc id="891655" wikidata="Q2943074" url="?curid=891655" title="NDP Socialist Caucus">
<text>The NDP Socialist Caucus is an unofficial left-wing faction within Canada&#x27;s New Democratic Party.

Its manifesto maintains that the New Democratic Party has moved too far to the right, and is in danger of becoming indistinguishable from the Liberal Party. Consequently, the Socialist Caucus also opposed Tony Blair&#x27;s Third Way policies and their adoption by the NDP because they &quot;[leave] the basic class and economic structures of capitalism unchanged.&quot;

==Origins==
The Socialist Caucus was founded in early 1998 in Toronto by Barry Weisleder, Joe Flexer, Sean Cain, Jorge Hurtado and other political activists who had been involved in Peter Kormos&#x27;s unsuccessful 1996 campaign to lead the Ontario New Democratic Party. It is active primarily in Ontario at the federal and provincial levels. 
The caucus views itself as the successor to The Waffle of the 1960s and 1970s and a number of members in the Socialist Caucus were also in the NDP&#x27;s Left Caucus and the Campaign for an Activist Party or CAP of the 1980s.

The Trotskyist group Socialist Action plays a &quot;leading role&quot; in the Socialist Caucus.

An earlier group called the Socialist Caucus was formed around 1959 and 1960 in Vancouver. It consisted of a group of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation dissidents, &quot;communists, Trotskyists, and fellow travellers&quot; led by former CCF Member of Parliament Rod Young, and was involved in the CCF and then the NDP. The group published a journal called &quot;Press&quot; and then &quot;Socialist Caucus Bulletin&quot;, which was co-edited by Ernie Tate. The group eventually had branches in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec and eventually folded into The Waffle.

==Policies==
The group is a socialist faction and advocates economic democracy and workers&#x27; control, full employment, the nationalization of large industries and the eradication of poverty and homelessness.

The caucus is anti-imperialist, and condemns many of the actions of the United States&#x27; government. It supports the Cuban Revolution, the withdrawal of Canada from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the independence of Quebec, and opposes Zionism.

==Leadership campaigns==
In 2001, the Socialist Caucus ran Marcel Hatch in a leadership challenge against Alexa McDonough. Hatch won 120 votes out of 765 ballots cast. Bev Meslo was the Socialist Caucus&#x27; candidate in the party&#x27;s 2003 leadership election, winning 1.1% of the vote in the party&#x27;s first One Member One Vote leadership election, which was won by Jack Layton.

After an unsuccessful attempt to draft Peter Kormos to run for the leadership of the Ontario NDP, the Socialist Caucus endorsed Michael Prue leading up to the 2009 ONDP leadership election.

In the 2012 and 2017 NDP leadership elections, the Socialist Caucus endorsed Niki Ashton, on the latter occasion after leading an unsuccessful effort to draft former Ontario Federation of Labour president Sid Ryan as a candidate.

==Other activities==
In 2011, the Socialist Caucus proposed resolutions at that year&#x27;s federal NDP convention to oppose the Alberta oil sands, legalize marijuana, boycott &quot;apartheid Israel&quot;, repeal the Clarity Act, and nationalize auto, bank and insurance companies. In the wake of the NDP&#x27;s breakthrough in the 2011 federal election in which they won over 100 seats and formed Official Opposition in the House of Commons for the first time, Socialist Caucus chair Barry Weisleder told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that &quot;the election on May 2 sent a very clear message: the voters rejected the Liberal Party and the NDP should not strive to become a substitute Liberal Party. That’s the road to ruin&quot;, adding that &quot;To survive, the NDP has to turn left and offer Canadians and in particular working people, an alternative to the corporate agenda.&quot; The faction also opposed a motion to remove the phrase &quot;democratic socialism&quot; from the preamble of the NDP&#x27;s constitution and supported an unsuccessful resolution to bar the NDP from considering merger with the Liberal Party of Canada. None of the resolutions proposed by the Socialist Caucus received enough support to reach the floor of the convention for debate.

The Socialist Caucus publishes a newspaper named &quot;Turn Left&quot;, edited by Sean Cain, for each federal and Ontario provincial NDP convention. Beginning with the 2011 NDP convention issue, the publication took the form of a magazine.

In September 2011, caucus chair Barry Weisleder won the nomination to be the Ontario NDP&#x27;s candidate in Thornhill in the 2011 provincial election. Within 48 hours, the party&#x27;s provincial secretary rescinded the nomination without explanation.

The Socialist Caucus opposed resolutions at the 2011 and 2013 federal NDP conventions to rewrite the preamble of the party&#x27;s constitution in order to remove its commitment to socialism.

The Socialist Caucus in the Ontario New Democratic Party criticized Andrea Horwath&#x27;s conduct of the party&#x27;s campaign in the 2014 provincial election and unsuccessfully called for a review of her leadership at the party&#x27;s subsequent convention in November 2014.

During the 2015 federal election, caucus leader Barry Weisleder was outspoken in his criticisms of the party&#x27;s platform and campaign, claiming that the party had moved to the right under leader Tom Mulcair. Weisleder told the &quot;National Post&quot; that the party under Mulcair had undergone &quot;a continuation of the movement towards conservative policies. It remains a party linked to working people and the working-class organizations in the country. But its leadership and the policies of that leadership continue to embrace the capitalist order.&quot; Subsequently, the Socialist Caucus called for the removal of Mulcair as party leader and supported a leadership review at the NDP convention held in April 2016 in Edmonton.

<text>The Aquabats are an American rock band formed in Huntington Beach, California, in 1994. Throughout many fluctuations in the group&#x27;s line-up, singer the MC Bat Commander and bassist Crash McLarson have remained the band&#x27;s two constant fixtures. As of 2024, the Aquabats&#x27; members include saxophonist Jimmy the Robot, drummer Ricky Fitness, guitarists Eaglebones Falconhawk and Chainsaw, the Prince of Karate, trumpeter Cat Boy and keyboardist Gorney.

Easily identified by their masks and matching costumes, the Aquabats are perhaps most recognized for their comedic persona in which they claim to be crime-fighting superheroes. This theme serves as subject for much of the band&#x27;s music and as part of their theatrical stage shows, which typically feature various stunts and fight scenes with costumed villains and monsters. Musically, the Aquabats have continuously evolved over the course of their career, initially starting as a ska band before reinventing themselves in the early 2000s as a new wave–influenced rock band. The band&#x27;s current musical style mixes rock and punk with elements of new wave, ska and synth-pop.

The Aquabats have released seven studio albums, three extended plays, two compilation albums and one soundtrack album, among other recordings. To date, three of the Aquabats&#x27; albums have charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200: 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats!&quot;, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Hi-Five Soup!&quot; and 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One&quot;. The Aquabats&#x27; seventh studio album, &quot;Finally!&quot;, was released on June 21, 2024.

From 2012 to 2014, the Aquabats also created and starred in &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, a live-action musical action-comedy television series which aired on American cable channel The Hub. The series ran for three seasons, earning a total of eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations and ultimately winning one. Following a successful Kickstarter campaign, the series was independently revived as a YouTube series from 2019 to 2021.

==History==
===Formation===
In the early 1990s, musicians Christian Jacobs, Chad Larson and Boyd Terry met and befriended each other while living in Brea, California. Having all been active in various local punk and alternative rock bands, the three eventually conceived the idea of forming a joke band satirizing the Orange County punk scene, which Jacobs described at the time as being overwhelmed with &quot;testosterone, beer and people fighting&quot;. The concept was to start an unabashedly silly punk band as a complete antithesis to the genre&#x27;s more aggressive and humorless bands, with the intention of performing at punk shows to poke fun at the scene. While later attending a ska show in Orange County, Jacobs was exposed to the area&#x27;s burgeoning ska scene and was impressed by its ethos: as he recalled, &quot;No one was fighting or pushing each other but having a good time&quot;. It was then decided that they would start a ska band instead, &quot;to be part of the fun&quot;.

With Jacobs assuming vocal duties, Larson on bass guitar and Terry on trumpet, the trio recruited several more musician friends from other local bands to piece together a full ensemble. Each member of the original line-up had musical backgrounds in various genres, including ska, punk, surf and new wave, all elements which were incorporated into the band&#x27;s music and aesthetic: for example, the name &quot;The Aquabats&quot; was created to sound like a classic surf band, while a shared admiration of Devo inspired the idea of matching costumes. Jacobs simply recalled in a 2013 interview, &quot;We wanted to combine Devo with surf music and ska&quot;. Rehearsing only once in a house Jacobs and Larson shared at the time, The Aquabats played their first show a mere week after forming at a house party in August 1994. Larson remembered this show as merely &quot;a joke...we weren&#x27;t trying to be a band. We were trying to have fun&quot;. Nevertheless, encouraged by a positive audience reception, The Aquabats started performing more local shows, soon becoming familiar faces within the Orange County underground.

===1994–1996: early years===
With professionalism far from foremost concern, The Aquabats&#x27; earliest band line-ups changed with almost every concert, occasionally featuring as many as twelve to fourteen musicians at a time onstage, with the majority typically playing brass instruments. As they gradually developed a steady following and began playing shows with more regularity, the band settled into a tighter and more manageable unit consisting of around eight to nine musicians, filled out by a horn section, two guitarists and a keyboardist. It was with this type of line-up that The Aquabats began recording, independently producing the demo tapes &quot;The Revenge of the Midget Punchers&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Bat Boy&quot; in 1995.
Initially, The Aquabats intended to make each of their performances unique by wearing a different set of matching costumes for every concert, ranging from chef&#x27;s uniforms to grass skirts and fezzes, all with an individual persona — during one show wearing chef outfits, for instance, the band hosted an actual onstage barbecue. When the group&#x27;s props and get-ups soon became more cumbersome to transport than their musical equipment, it was ultimately decided a singular costume was required. Terry, a future apparel designer who was employed by the wetsuit manufacturing company Aleeda at the time, acquired a large amount of spare rubber and neoprene and fashioned together a set of helmets and rashguards for the band members. The addition of customized vinyl belts, donated to the band by then-unknown artist Paul Frank, effectively completed the style The Aquabats would maintain for the rest of their career.

To accompany their distinct new uniforms, The Aquabats constructed a backstory which alleged they were actually superheroes hailing from the distant island of &quot;Aquabania&quot;, though Larson admits the entire mythology was simply made up piece by piece as they went along from one interviewer to the next. As their mythology grew, the members soon adopted superhero stage names and identities, and began tailoring their live shows around a comic book aesthetic by incorporating onstage stunts and mock battles with costumed villains, antics which were originally ploys to get the band&#x27;s friends into shows for free. Jacobs&#x27; brothers Parker and Tyler, a cartoonist and graphic artist, respectively, were brought in to help develop the band&#x27;s cartoon-influenced visual style, designing their logos and promotional material as well as playing characters in The Aquabats&#x27; stage shows and mythology.

In 1995, The Aquabats independently produced and recorded their debut album, &quot;The Return of The Aquabats&quot;, pressing the CDs themselves. Having already amassed a sizable cult following for their increasingly eccentric live shows, the band managed to sell a respectable 20,000 copies of their album without any marketing or distribution. With the growing mainstream popularity of ska music, The Aquabats quickly rose to prominence within Orange County&#x27;s booming ska scene, regularly touring alongside the likes of such commercially successful bands as No Doubt, Sublime and Reel Big Fish and bringing them to the brink of achieving mainstream recognition.

===1997–1998: &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats!&quot; and mainstream breakthrough===
By late 1996, propelled by the multi-platinum success of No Doubt and Sublime, ska had broken through into the American mainstream to become one of the most popular forms of alternative music. With record labels now turning their attention towards ska bands, The Aquabats were promptly signed to Goldenvoice Records and released their second album, &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats!&quot;, in October 1997 through Time Bomb Recordings. While still predominantly a ska album, &quot;The Fury&quot; showcased a more ambitious musical streak than &quot;The Return&quot;, incorporating stronger elements of punk and surf, as well as featuring instrumentals, parodies of ragtime and tango music, and a variety of unconventional instruments including sousaphones and banjos. Released at the commercial height of the American ska revival, &quot;The Fury&quot; earned The Aquabats minor mainstream success, peaking at number 172 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 12 on its Top Heatseekers, while lead single &quot;Super Rad!&quot; found regular airplay on MTV and Los Angeles&#x27; influential KROQ-FM. On July 25, 1998, they fought the alien rock band Gwar during The Ska Parade.

The Aquabats spent 1997 and 1998 touring extensively behind &quot;The Fury&quot;, carrying out both supporting and headlining tours of the United States and traveling internationally as part of the 1998 Warped Tour. By this time, the band had settled into a stable touring line-up of Jacobs (The Bat Commander), Larson (Crash McLarson), Terry (Catboy), drummer Travis Barker (The Baron Von Tito), guitarists Charles Gray (Ultra Kyu) and Courtney Pollock (Chainsaw, the Prince of Karate), trumpeter Adam Deibert (Prince Adam) and keyboardist/saxophonist James Briggs (Jaime the Robot, later Jimmy the Robot). This line-up would last The Aquabats up until 1998, when, in the middle of a tour with pop punk trio Blink-182, Blink unexpectedly fired their drummer Scott Raynor and recruited Barker as a last-minute replacement to sit in for the rest of the tour. By the tour&#x27;s close, the band was so impressed with Barker&#x27;s performance that they invited him to join Blink-182 as a full-time member, an offer which Barker accepted, amicably parting ways with The Aquabats. Barker was succeeded by Gabe Palmer (Doctor Rock), solidifying a line-up which would last the remainder of the decade.

With the band now finding enough success to generate both an adequate income and media visibility, Jacobs — a former child actor with ties in the entertainment industry — began to conceive the idea of adapting The Aquabats&#x27; superhero mythology into a television series. After pitching the concept to several networks, Buena Vista Television eventually agreed to help produce a short live-action pilot in 1998, directed by comedian Bobcat Goldthwait. Titled simply &quot;The Aquabats!&quot;, the pilot followed the fictional misadventures of the eight band members in an intentionally campy style similar to Saturday morning cartoon shows. The pilot, which has yet to be made available for public viewing, failed to attract any network interest and was later openly disowned by the band themselves.

===1999–2004: change in genre, career decline and semi-hiatus===

By the time The Aquabats began writing new material for their next studio album in 1998, the group had begun to feel pigeonholed by their public status as a &quot;cheesy ska band&quot; and consciously decided to start exploring more diverse musical styles rather than merely returning to a ska-based sound. As such, the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!&quot;, marked an abrupt stylistic shift, completely abandoning the ska rhythms which dominated their previous albums in favor of more punk and new wave-influenced textures, emphasizing guitar and synthesizer-driven melodies over brass and woodwinds. With the total absence of The Aquabats&#x27; formerly marketable ska sound, Goldenvoice expressed mixed feelings over &quot;Floating Eye&quot;, reportedly telling the band that the album had no potential single material and would be difficult to promote. In a 2005 interview, Larson retrospectively lamented upon &quot;Floating Eye&quot;″s lack of a commercial sound, noting that while he and the band felt the material was strong, it &quot;probably wasn&#x27;t the record we should have put out at that time&quot;.

True to their predictions, &quot;Floating Eye&quot; failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor, charting only at a mere 35 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers. Despite the album&#x27;s underwhelming performance, Goldenvoice nevertheless granted The Aquabats a small budget for a music video, which the band instead used to film a five-minute promotional video as another prospective television pilot, &quot;The Aquabats! In Color!&quot;, an action-oriented series styled similarly to Japanese tokusatsu shows. Despite potential interest from the Fox Family Channel prior to their acquisition by Disney which cancelled all development deals, the pilot again failed to generate any interest, bringing The Aquabats&#x27; career to a standstill.

Following the huge financial losses Goldenvoice suffered from the inaugural Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 1999, the company was eventually forced to cease operations, leaving the Aquabats without a record label. After an unsuccessful search for a new label, the band eventually turned to the Internet to independently manage and promote themselves while the members resumed their day jobs to continue funding the band. Jacobs likened the experience to a superhero&#x27;s alter ego, working by day and fighting crime [read: being an Aquabat] by night. While The Aquabats could not secure a proper recording contract, the band did negotiate a distribution deal with Fearless Records, releasing a collection of outtakes and demos from the &quot;Floating Eye&quot; sessions entitled &quot;Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2&quot; before slipping back into a period of relative inactivity.

With a lack of label support leaving the band to finance themselves entirely out of pocket, The Aquabats indefinitely postponed all plans for future recording or extensive touring, limiting their activity primarily to sporadic shows in the southwest United States. The loss of touring income, coupled with the band members&#x27; return to their jobs and families, eventually contributed to the departure of several key members: in 2000, guitarist Gray left the band, followed by Palmer and co-founder Terry in 2002. To avoid the financial constraints of hiring two new members, Adam Deibert assumed a dual role as trumpeter and guitarist for the band&#x27;s live shows, while Palmer was replaced by former Assorted Jelly Beans drummer Ricky Falomir (Ricky Fitness). With this more stable and compact line-up, The Aquabats returned to the studio to record original music for Evan Dorkin″s &quot;Welcome to Eltingville&quot;, a 2002 animated television pilot which aired on Adult Swim but was ultimately not picked up as a series. The following year, the band would release their first DVD, &quot;Serious Awesomeness!&quot;, featuring a full live performance filmed in Pomona, California, and numerous clips spanning their entire career.

In 2004, with almost five years passed since having released any official studio material, The Aquabats independently recorded and released the five-track EP &quot;Yo! Check Out This Ride!&quot; as an attempt to both satisfy the band&#x27;s fanbase and serve as a potential demo to attract interest from record labels. As their first recording with only six members and no use of a horn section, &quot;Yo! Check Out This Ride!&quot; marked the most drastic shift yet in The Aquabats&#x27; sound, taking the band even further into keyboard-driven rock and new wave-influenced songwriting. This would also mark Deibert&#x27;s final recording with the band, as he would officially retire from the group later in the year, reducing The Aquabats to a quintet.

===2005–2009: &quot;Charge!!&quot; and renewed success===
In the summer of 2004, The Aquabats were signed to independent label Nitro Records and began work on a new studio album in the fall. Despite this fortuitous turn of events, the group were still uncertain of their future following their semi-hiatus and radical shift in line-up; Jacobs later admitted that the band spent the recording sessions under the belief that it could possibly be their last album. After several months of production and much online hype, The Aquabats released their fourth album, &quot;Charge!!&quot;, on July 7, 2005. Continuing with the direction set by &quot;Yo! Check Out This Ride!&quot;, &quot;Charge!!&quot; was a bold introduction to The Aquabats&#x27; new musical style of guitar-driven, new wave-influenced rock.

Released to a largely positive critical reception with many critics praising the band&#x27;s shift in genre, &quot;Charge!!&quot; effectively revitalized The Aquabats&#x27; career as the band recommitted themselves to regular touring. Days after the album&#x27;s release, The Aquabats headlined a successful 34-city tour of the United States with similarly theatrical bands The Epoxies and The Phenomenauts, followed by tours of the United Kingdom and Japan, the latter supporting Nitro Records founders The Offspring. On September 23, 2005, The Aquabats made their national television debut on the G4 program &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;, performing &quot;Charge!!&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Fashion Zombies!&quot;.

While the following year would present even more lucrative touring opportunities for The Aquabats, the band&#x27;s renewed success would also have its drawbacks. In May 2006, it was announced that guitarist Pollock had reluctantly departed the group after 12 years, claiming the band&#x27;s increased touring activity was conflicting with his business schedule. Pollock was succeeded by former Death by Stereo member Ian Fowles (Eaglebones Falconhawk), though he would continue to contribute guitar tracks to The Aquabats&#x27; studio albums and perform with the band as a second guitarist for their southern California concerts and major festival shows. After releasing a limited-print tongue-in-cheek &quot;One Year Anniversary Edition&quot; of &quot;Charge!!&quot;, The Aquabats carried out another national tour before announcing a brief hiatus in January 2007 to focus on writing their next album.
During this period, Jacobs had been pursuing a career in television production with his creative partner and longtime Aquabats collaborator Scott Schultz, independently filming prospective pilots for family television shows. In 2007, Jacobs and Schultz successfully sold one of their pilots, a preschooler show called &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;, to Viacom″s Nick Jr. Channel. As a musically oriented program, &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; featured several guest appearances by The Aquabats, appearing onscreen performing both old and new songs and starring in various sketches. The series went on to become an award-winning international sensation, bringing a generous amount of media attention towards both Jacobs and The Aquabats, just enough to persuade &quot;Gabba&quot;″s production company Wild Brain to help produce a new pilot again based on the band.

Shot on location throughout California in early 2008, The Aquabats&#x27; third television pilot, titled &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, was a fully realized half-hour episode featuring both live-action and animated storylines starring and featuring original music by the band. The Aquabats spent the remainder of 2008 heavily promoting the &quot;Super Show!&quot; pilot through extensive viral advertising and further touring, including appearances at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, where the pilot was publicly debuted for fans, high-profile festivals including the Bamboozle Left and Groezrock in April 2009, and opening for Blink-182 on two dates of their 2009 reunion tour.

Though The Aquabats continued to be a popular touring draw, the band experienced a tumultuous period of pre-production on their proposed fifth studio album lasting for nearly two years. Though a July 2007 news update announced that preliminary recording had already begun, no new material ever surfaced from these sessions or was ever performed live. As the band resumed touring throughout the United States and Europe, fewer updates were reported on the album&#x27;s progress until all plans were abruptly ceased in April 2009, when The Aquabats were dropped from Nitro Records due to &quot;trying economic times and a struggling musical landscape&quot;, according to Jacobs. With a glum confirmation of &quot;no record company, no record&quot;, The Aquabats&#x27; future seemed once again shadowed in doubt.

===2010–2013: &quot;Hi-Five Soup!&quot; and &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;===
Despite the lack of a record label, The Aquabats continued to tour internationally throughout 2010 and 2011, headlining tours of the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as appearing at the 2010 Soundwave festival in Australia — the band&#x27;s first ever visit to the continent. In August 2010, The Aquabats suddenly announced on their website that they would be independently releasing their next studio album in November of that year. However, following a last-minute distribution deal with Fearless Records, the album&#x27;s release date was postponed to 2011 to provide for proper marketing and promotion, and an EP containing its first single, &quot;Radio Down!&quot;, was released in its place. &quot;Hi-Five Soup!&quot;, The Aquabats&#x27; fifth full-length album, was released on January 18, 2011, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album since &quot;The Fury&quot;, debuting at number 181 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 5 on Top Heatseekers. In promotion of the album, the band embarked on a 21-city national tour supporting Reel Big Fish, followed by a performance at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

On March 24, 2011, it was formally announced via press release that &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot; had been acquired as a series by family cable channel The Hub, a joint venture between Hasbro and Discovery which launched in 2010 as a replacement for Discovery Kids. Created and produced by Jacobs, Schultz and Jason deVilliers, the series followed the fictionalized adventures of The Aquabats in a deliberately campy style inspired by the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, mixing live-action storylines with cartoon shorts, parody commercials and musical interludes featuring new original music and songs written and performed by the band.

After spending the majority of 2011 in production, the first season of &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot; ran for thirteen episodes from March 3, 2012, to June 16, 2012, meeting with a largely positive critical reception and consistently high ratings for the modestly sized channel, eventually earning a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Series, which it ultimately lost to fellow Hub series &quot;R. L. Stine&#x27;s The Haunting Hour&quot;. In October 2012, production began on the series&#x27; second season, which premiered on June 1, 2013, with a short run of five episodes. The following October, three additional episodes were filmed, though The Hub later explicitly referred to these episodes as &quot;specials&quot; rather than a continuation of season two. These three specials aired from December 21, 2013, to January 14, 2014.

In a &quot;Huffington Post&quot; feature on the band prior to the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, Jacobs revealed that The Hub had opted not to renew &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot; for another season following extensive network rebranding by Hasbro and Discovery, effectively canceling the series. Jacobs admitted he was surprised by this turn of events, noting &quot;Everything we heard was that the show has been a real Cinderella story for the Hub and that it was rating really well with viewers. We just assumed that we&#x27;d eventually go back into production or at least get picked up for Season 3&quot;, but ultimately concluded &quot;it is what it is&quot; in regard to the network&#x27;s decision.

===2014–2018: continued touring and anniversary shows===
Since the 2012 premiere of &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, The Aquabats largely cut back on extensive touring in order to accommodate their television production schedule, once again limiting their live shows to occasional performances within the Southwestern United States. In April 2013, the band carried out a six-show tour of Europe and the United Kingdom, concluding with an appearance at the Groezrock punk rock festival in Belgium. The following June, The Aquabats were once again featured on the Warped Tour, though only played eight shows in the Southwest region. Despite playing a limited portion of the tour, the band were regularly featured on the second season of Fuse″s &quot;Warped Roadies&quot;, a reality series documenting the road crew of the Warped Tour, where they were most notably the subject of one episode in which they incur the wrath of a stage manager for repeatedly playing over their set times.

On March 17, 2014, in celebration of their 20th anniversary as a band, The Aquabats announced the first leg of their &quot;20th Anniversary Tour&quot; for May, their first extensive headlining United States tour in years, covering fifteen shows in nine states on the East Coast. The following July, the band carried out five more dates across California, Washington and Oregon, then announced eleven more dates covering six states across the western half of the country.

Following another stretch of relative inactivity for most of 2015 and 2016, The Aquabats announced a 13-date tour of the American Midwest and East Coast in May 2017, supported by Reggie and the Full Effect, C. J. Ramone and Kepi Ghoulie, subsequently followed by a six-date tour of the West Coast in October with Dog Party. Ticket options for these shows included &quot;Super Rad Packages&quot; with bonus exclusive merchandise, most notably a split 7&quot; single of full-length versions of the &quot;Super Show!&quot; songs &quot;Burger Rain&quot; and &quot;Beat Fishin&#x27;&quot;, The Aquabats&#x27; first new studio recordings since 2011&#x27;s &quot;Hi-Five Soup&quot;. In mid-February 2018, The Aquabats played nine dates in the United Kingdom with Army of Freshmen supporting Bowling for Soup on their &quot;Get Happy!&quot; tour.

In celebration of the 20th anniversary of 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats!&quot;, the band worked with veteran producer and engineer Cameron Webb on a complete remaster of the album which was independently released on vinyl and CD with bonus material on April 6, 2018. The following day, The Aquabats played two sold-out shows at Los Angeles&#x27; Fonda Theater where they performed &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats!&quot; in its entirety, joined by former members Pollock, Terry and Deibert. Notably, Travis Barker appeared during the evening show to play three songs as his Baron von Tito persona, marking the first time Barker had performed with the band since 1998. Three weeks later on April 28, this extended line-up performed as part of Barker and John Feldmann&#x27;s Back To The Beach ska festival in Huntington State Beach, where Barker again joined the band for three songs.

===2019-present: &quot;The Aquabats! RadVentures!&quot;, &quot;Kooky Spooky...In Stereo&quot;, and &quot;Finally!&quot;===
On July 31, 2018, after several weeks of teasing a major band announcement, The Aquabats launched a high-profile Kickstarter campaign with the goal of raising a minimum of $1.1 million to help finance an entire return season of &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, as well as the production and release of three albums: a new studio album, a &quot;Super Show!&quot; soundtrack and a re-recorded greatest hits compilation. The campaign video featured a slew of celebrity cameos voicing support for the band, though most prominently featured actor and musician Jack Black, who was confirmed by &quot;Billboard&quot; to serve as executive producer for the series&#x27; return. Along with the launch of the Kickstarter, The Aquabats began releasing a series of metafictional &quot;Super Show!&quot; &quot;mini-episodes&quot; exclusively to their YouTube channel, depicting the MC Bat Commander&#x27;s quest to reunite the estranged Aquabats following their show&#x27;s cancellation.

By August 28, mere days before the campaign&#x27;s end date of September 1, the Kickstarter had only raised $601,629 of the band&#x27;s desired $1.1 million goal. The funding was voluntarily cancelled and the campaign was significantly restructured, resurrected the same day with a new goal of $100,000 for a new album and continuing production of &quot;Super Show!&quot; &quot;mini-episodes&quot;. The $100,000 mark was met within minutes and the project ultimately raised over $600,000, which was stated to be used to independently produce &quot;at least twelve&quot; mini-episodes of &quot;Super Show!&quot;, two new Aquabats studio albums, one live album, and two &quot;Super Show!&quot; soundtrack albums.

Throughout 2019, The Aquabats worked resolutely to fulfill their Kickstarter-funded projects. In March, the band simultaneously released &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One&quot;, a soundtrack compilation of songs from &quot;Super Show!&quot;″s first season, and &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats! Live at The Fonda!&quot;, a live recording of a 2018 performance of &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats!&quot;, as exclusive digital downloads for Kickstarter backers. In June, preceded by the release of the single &quot;Cobraman Theme!&quot;, &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One&quot; was given a wide physical release on The Aquabats&#x27; self-operated label Gloopy Records, premiering at 165 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on Top Heatseekers, the band&#x27;s highest placement on each chart to date. Starting September 28, 2019, &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot; was officially relaunched as a biweekly YouTube-exclusive web series entitled &quot;The Aquabats! RadVentures!&quot;.

&quot;Skeleton Inside!&quot;, the first single from The Aquabats&#x27; sixth studio album, premiered on the band&#x27;s YouTube channel on October 25, 2019, though did not make mention of an album title or a tentative release date beyond &quot;later this year&quot;. The album&#x27;s official title, &quot;Kooky Spooky...In Stereo&quot;, was revealed in February 2020, followed by the album&#x27;s second single, the couch potato-themed &quot;Pajamazon!&quot;, on April 10. Inspired by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, which necessitated mass self-quarantining and social distancing, &quot;Pajamazon!&quot; was promoted by a music video primarily made up of self-submitted videos of fans and friends of The Aquabats dancing to the song in their homes, marking The Aquabats&#x27; first music video since &quot;Fashion Zombies!&quot; in 2005. While &quot;Kooky Spooky...In Stereo&quot; was originally scheduled for a June 20 release date, manufacturing delays resulting from the coronavirus pandemic as well as political tensions from the ongoing George Floyd protests which began in late May 2020 prompted the band to postpone the album&#x27;s release; in an uncharacteristically serious public statement, The Aquabats acknowledged that &quot;There will always be time for goofy, rowdy rock...but it doesn&#x27;t feel right to us to be loud and self-promoting at this moment in time&quot;, encouraging open discussion about race and racism and linking to resources from the National Museum of African American History and Culture and confirming a new digital release date of August 21, 2020.

On February 29, 2024, the band announced their seventh album, &quot;Finally!&quot;, as well as the return of Chainsaw The Prince of Karate and Catboy and introducing Gorney. The album dropped on June 21st.

==Musical style==
Over the course of their career, The Aquabats have experienced several radical evolutions in their sound and musical style.

Having originally formed as a part of Orange County&#x27;s burgeoning third wave ska scene, much of the band&#x27;s early material was rooted in the genre. Boasting an eight-piece line-up featuring two lead guitarists, a keyboardist and a horn section consisting of two trumpets and a saxophone, The Aquabats&#x27; style of ska was primarily driven by brass and guitar, incorporating elements of surf rock and punk rock. Their second album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Fury of The Aquabats!&quot;, while still predominantly ska-based, found the band starting to expand their sound into newer territory, featuring more pronounced punk and surf influences and experimentalism, including several instrumentals, pastiches of ragtime and tango music and the utilization of such unconventional instruments as clarinets, electric sitars and even manualism.

In 1999, The Aquabats underwent a significant shift in style for their third studio album, &quot;The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!&quot;, and its companion piece &quot;Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2&quot;, further exploring the multi-genre eclecticism which had been hinted at with &quot;The Fury&quot;. A conscious decision by the band to write more diverse material, these albums saw a near-complete forfeit of the brass-driven ska of their previous albums in favor of more guitar and synthesizer-structured songwriting, embracing a punk rock and new wave sound greatly influenced by Devo and Oingo Boingo, two of The Aquabats&#x27; biggest inspirations. The band also began widening their genre experimentation to encompass such disparate styles as electronica, synthpop and even hip-hop, elements which persist in their sound to present day.

During The Aquabats&#x27; career lull in the early 2000s, several of the band&#x27;s key members departed from the line-up, eventually reducing the former octet down to a mere quintet of vocals, guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums. This inevitably had a profound impact on The Aquabats&#x27; sound, in particular the complete loss of their once characteristic horn section. 2005&#x27;s &quot;Charge!!&quot;, the first release featuring this reduced line-up, marked an abrupt shift from the eclecticism of their previous records, firmly establishing The Aquabats&#x27; current rock-based musical style, mixing elements of punk, new wave and ska, a style which has also been described as some publications as &quot;nerd rock&quot; owing to the band&#x27;s lyrical emphasis on pop culture.

In recent years, The Aquabats have introduced an increased presence of keyboards and synthesizers into this style, with critics noting their 2011 album &quot;Hi-Five Soup!&quot; as featuring more noticeable elements of synthpop and electronica.

===Departure from ska genre===
Although the band continues to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced themselves from their association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a &quot;rock band&quot; in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska&quot;, noting elsewhere, &quot;It was never a deliberate thing [to stop playing ska], but I think it just naturally happened because there&#x27;s a lot of different styles of music that we play. I&#x27;ve always been into bands like Ween and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there&#x27;s no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you&#x27;re a ska band, you just play ska&quot;. Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained &quot;Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the &#x27;adventure&#x27; songs than really &#x27;ska&#x27; songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms&quot;, adding &quot;we were never really a good ska band anyway&quot;.

==Live performances==

Since the earliest days of the band, The Aquabats have earned a reputation for their theatrical live performances featuring a variety of comedic stunts and antics based around their superhero-themed persona.

During the 1990s, when their concerts were at their most elaborately staged, a typical Aquabats performance would often include choreographed fight scenes with costumed villains, the use of numerous props, acrobatic stunts and varying degrees of pyrotechnics, ranging from small fireworks to The MC Bat Commander fire breathing. While many of these elements were eventually phased out of the live shows in the early 2000s, the one consistent staple of every Aquabats concert has remained the band&#x27;s onstage &quot;battles&quot; with villains and monsters. These villains, typically played by The Aquabats&#x27; road crew, will crash the stage at one or two moments in the show and exchange humorous banter with the band before engaging each other in mock combat. These fights have ranged from short, improvised fistfights to fully choreographed stage combat utilizing breakable props, maneuvers such as flying kicks and back flips, and sometimes spreading out into the audience, with The Aquabats ultimately winning most—but not all—encounters. For some performances, in place of a villain, The Aquabats will feature a sketch with one of their &quot;allies&quot;: for example, to segue into their song &quot;Magic Chicken&quot;, the titular character— a man in a chicken suit— will come onstage to hand out fried chicken to audience members.

Audience participation is a common element of The Aquabats&#x27; stage shows. Both the band and their onstage characters regularly interact with the crowd, including initiating mass games of beach ball volleyball or spraying them with substances like Silly String and fire extinguishers. Additionally, a few of The Aquabats&#x27; enemies are known only to be &quot;defeated&quot; by fans by being pelted with projectiles supplied by the band, usually large quantities of plastic balls. Acknowledging the younger members of their fanbase, The Aquabats often incorporate any children in the venue as part of their shows, inviting them to dance onstage with the band at the end of their sets. With parents&#x27; permission, children can also take part in onstage games and activities with the aid of the audience. The most common of these have included &quot;pool floatie races&quot;, where two selected children mount inflatable rafts or pool toys and race across the venue via crowd surfing, and assisted stage diving, in which between songs the MC Bat Commander will gently throw children into a waiting audience so they may experience their &quot;first punk rock moment&quot;.

On the visual end of these performances, keeping in line with their cartoon and pop culture-inspired aesthetic, The Aquabats&#x27; stage shows are accompanied by a large video screen backdrop which plays montage clips of various cartoons, movies, TV shows, and stock footage specifically edited to match each song. This screen also plays prerecorded comedy videos starring the band which introduce and close each show, as well as fake commercials for fictional Aquabats-brand products which serve as impromptu &quot;commercial breaks&quot; between songs. These visuals, along with the band&#x27;s props and costumes, are regularly changed to accommodate special seasonal performances, in particular The Aquabats&#x27; annual holiday shows.

==Superhero mythology==

Perhaps even more so than for their music, The Aquabats are widely recognized for their eccentric superhero identity which adheres to a comprehensive mythology reflected in the band&#x27;s music, stage shows and promotional material in which the members are in fact a team of musical crimefighters on a quest to save the world.

Detailed in their lyrics, liner notes, website and television series, The Aquabats have developed a small but elaborate fictional universe surrounding this mythology, describing the band&#x27;s fictitious history and outlandish adventures as well as conceiving an extensive roster of enemies and allies, many of whom are the subjects of specific songs and have appeared as part of The Aquabats&#x27; stage shows in mock fight scenes or comedic skits. Over the years, this mythology, and in particular the fictional backstory regarding their origins, has continually changed, evolved and occasionally been retconned to explain changes in the band&#x27;s line-up.

The Aquabats&#x27; origin story can be separated into two distinct eras. For the first half of their career, the band maintained a consistently canonical backstory established over the course of their first two albums, alleging the band members were actually humanoid bat creatures hailing from a distant tropical island called Aquabania. According to legend, Aquabania had been invaded by the villainous Space Monster &quot;M&quot;, forcing the surviving inhabitants to flee into the ocean where they eventually washed ashore in California and were taken in by Professor Monty Corndog, a mad scientist who used &quot;chemicals&quot; to give them superpowers. Donning costumes including such accessories as &quot;radioactive rashguards&quot;, &quot;power belts&quot;, and &quot;anti-negativity helmets&quot;, The Aquabats chose to channel their powers through music in order to &quot;take over the world&quot; by attracting legions of fans to aid them in combating Space Monster &quot;M&quot; and reclaiming their homeland, fighting the numerous villains and monsters who&#x27;d attempt to thwart their musical quest along the way.

With the heavy line-up changes in the early-to-mid 2000s which left only two of the original members remaining, The Aquabats eventually dropped the Aquabania elements out of their backstory, reestablishing themselves as a group of freelance superheroes of indeterminate origin who travel the countryside, fighting evil and &quot;destroying boredom&quot;. This loose framework would later serve as the basis for the band&#x27;s television series, &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, where each member&#x27;s character was further developed to showcase their own individual powers and personalities, transitioning the Aquabats&#x27; mythology from a story arc to a character ensemble. While the series&#x27; first season left the band&#x27;s origins intentionally vague, several episodes of the second season feature each member of The Aquabats recounting the band&#x27;s history in animated flashback sequences; while one of these sequences recalls the original Aquabania mythos, each member&#x27;s flashbacks directly contradict one another, leaving it unknown which could be considered officially canonical.

==Aquacadets and The Aquabats Cadet Faction==

Fans of The Aquabats are referred to by the band as Aquacadets or the more casual &quot;Cadets&quot;, a title which has held alternately official and unofficial status among their fanbase for most of the band&#x27;s career.

Throughout the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s, The Aquabats operated an official fan club known as The Aquabats Cadet Faction, selling membership packages which typically offered a variety of exclusive merchandise, access to exclusive web content, a subscription to an official newsletter written by members of the band and entrance into occasional semi-private &quot;secret shows&quot; held at smaller venues. Most significantly, enrollment into The Aquabats Cadet Faction granted card-carrying members admission into official fan conventions known as Cadet Summits, where fans could meet and interact with The Aquabats through Q&amp;A panels, games and award shows where fans received trophies in categories including &quot;Cadet of the Year&quot;. The Aquabats held five such Cadet Summits throughout Southern California from 1997 to 2006:

* October 25, 1997, Fountain Valley: The Aquabats hosted a day for fans at Bullwinkle&#x27;s Family Fun&#x27;N&#x27;Food family entertainment center, which featured the premiere screening of the &quot;Super Rad!&quot; music video.
* December 5, 1998, Pomona: the band performed an exclusive show at The Glass House concert venue alongside screenings of various videos including the only public showing of &quot;The Aquabats!&quot; 1998 television pilot.
* April 6, 2000, Santa Ana: advertised as &quot;The Third Sorta-Annual 1999/2000 Aquacadet Summit&quot;, The Aquabats performed an extended awards show-themed concert at The Galaxy Theatre, featuring additional performances by side projects The Moon Monkeys, Digital Unicorn and Le Pigbat.
* January 18, 2002, Huntington Beach: The Aquabats hosted a picnic gathering on the beach, highlighted by an acoustic singalong set made up entirely of fan requests. This performance was recorded and later released as an officially sanctioned bootleg cassette in 2014.
* June 6, 2006, in San Diego: hosted at the Concourse Meeting Hall during San Diego Comic-Con weekend, the band celebrated the 10th anniversary of &quot;The Return of The Aquabats&quot; by performing the album in its entirety with former member Prince Adam.

Following the 2006 Cadet Summit, The Aquabats Cadet Faction lapsed into an extended period of complete inactivity, upon which fans independently carried on unofficial fan club operations through social media, most notably the formation of numerous splinter factions based around certain themes, shared interests or geographic location: while most of these groups were small sub-sections within online fan communities such as Tumblr, some factions like &quot;Piratebats&quot; and &quot;Ninjabats&quot; cultivated a small real-world presence by attending The Aquabats&#x27; concerts in accordingly themed costume attire. In 2018, The Aquabats temporarily resurrected The Aquabats Cadet Faction as part of the &quot;Bring Back The Aquabats!&quot; Kickstarter campaign, again issuing personalized ID cards and exclusive merchandise and web content. On Dec. 7, 2024, a Cadet Summit was held in conjunction with the 30th anniversary shows at the Glass House in Pomona, Calif.

In 2019, independent record label Related Records, who had previously released the officially sanctioned 2014 bootleg of The Aquabats&#x27; acoustic performance at the 2002 Cadet Summit, compiled and released &quot;No Singles: A 20 Year Anniversary Tribute to The Aquabats vs. The Floating Eye of Death&quot;, a fourteen-track tribute album covering the entirety of the band&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Floating Eye of Death&quot; album by various underground punk, electronica and experimental musicians.

==Side bands and related projects==

The roots of The Aquabats are usually traced back to GOGO13, a ska band founded by Christian Jacobs&#x27; brothers Parker and Tyler while they were living in St. George, Utah, in 1993. Following their abrupt disbandment in 1994, several of GOGO13&#x27;s members moved on to play in The Aquabats&#x27; earliest line-ups, during which time the band&#x27;s performances consisted of several GOGO13 songs, most notably &quot;Idiot Box!&quot;, which was later recorded for The Aquabats&#x27; first two albums. Parker Jacobs permanently reformed GOGO13 in 2001 and continues to tour with a rotating line-up of musicians which, among others, have included original Aquabats trumpeter Boyd Terry and guitarist Ben &quot;The Brain&quot; Bergeson.

From 1993 to 1995, Adam Deibert, Charles Gray, Corey Pollock and Pat &quot;Patbat&quot; McDonald were all members of the Huntington Beach ska band The Goodwin Club, recording only one full-length album before disbanding in April 1995, playing their final show opening for The Aquabats. The Goodwin Club reunited in 2015 with Deibert, Pollock and McDonald returning from the original line-up and continue to sporadically perform throughout Southern California, including as support for The Aquabats and GOGO13. Prior to forming The Aquabats, Christian Jacobs sang in a shoegazing duo called The Moon Men with future Aquabats and &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; collaborator Scott Schultz, while Chad Larson was the bass guitarist for the hardcore punk band B.H.R. until their break-up in 1997.

In 1997, Parker Jacobs formed The Sandfleas as a side project to perform as openers at The Aquabats&#x27; shows, based on the gang of masked villains who had become a staple of The Aquabats&#x27; mythology and onstage . Consisting anonymously of Parker Jacobs on vocals and a rotating line-up of musicians including Christian and Tyler Jacobs, Larson and Pollock, The Sandfleas played deliberately sloppy punk rock songs which were humorously antagonistic and insulting towards their audience, intending to be the musical &quot;bad guy&quot; equivalent to The Aquabats&#x27; &quot;good guys&quot;. The Sandfleas released an EP entitled &quot;Four Songs Four Jerks&quot; on The Aquabats&#x27; Horchata Records label in 1999 before breaking up shortly afterwards.

During their time in The Aquabats, Deibert and Gray both joined the Long Beach indie pop band Bikeride in 1999 as bassist and guitarist, respectively, recording on three of the band&#x27;s studio albums, all of which featured James Briggs″ guest contributions on saxophone and clarinet. Gray left Bikeride in 2002, though Deibert remained a member until lead singer-songwriter Tony Carbone&#x27;s death from cancer in 2008. Shortly before Carbone&#x27;s death, The Aquabats hosted a benefit show for Carbone in Pomona, California, where Deibert joined the band onstage during their encores. From 1999 to 2010, Deibert was also active in the two-man electronic project Digital Unicorn, which he had originally created as a last-minute replacement for an opening band who had dropped off a tour with The Aquabats. Digital Unicorn eventually progressed into a solo endeavor, culminating in the studio album &quot;Theirs Travel Began and Loaded the Dream&quot;, which was released on Horchata Records in 2001.

After leaving The Aquabats in 1996, Ben Bergeson founded the instrumental surf rock band The Moon Monkeys, playing numerous shows with The Aquabats and GOGO13 before releasing their sole studio EP &quot;So Far, Far Out!&quot; in 1999 on Horchata Records. Corey Pollock, following his own departure from The Aquabats in 2006, joined the Costa Mesa pop punk trio and longtime Aquabats tourmates Supernova in August 2008, playing with them under his Aquabat stage name of &quot;Chainsaw&quot; until their hiatus in January 2010.

As professional musicians, current guitarist Ian Fowles and drummer Ricky Falomir have performed and recorded with many bands and musicians of note, though are best known as original members of the punk rock bands Death by Stereo and Assorted Jelly Beans, respectively. In relation to The Aquabats, Fowles was a guest bassist for Hunter Burgan″s Hunter Revenge and – in costume as EagleBones – Kepi Ghoulie″s band during both groups&#x27; tours with The Aquabats, and in 2014, became an official member of My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way″s solo band after the two had become acquainted working together on &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, recording and co-writing on Way&#x27;s 2014 debut &quot;Hesitant Alien&quot;. In June 2015, both Fowles and Falomir made up ex-Ramones bassist C. J. Ramone″s backing band for an East Coast tour with Japanese band Shonen Knife. Ricky also toured playing drums for LA reggae band The Aggrolites in 2009.

The band&#x27;s original instrumental version of &quot;Sequence Erase!&quot;, recorded with Parry Gripp, was used as the title theme for the band&#x27;s original television pilot, &quot;The Aquabats! In Color!&quot;. From 2004 to 2010, this recording was used as the theme song to the main series of &quot;Mega64&quot;, a video game-themed comedy series produced by a comedy troupe of the same name. As longtime friends and associates of The Aquabats, the main cast and crew of &quot;Mega64&quot; would later go on to produce interstitial sketches for &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot; television series.

<text>Earl John &quot;Sparky&quot; Adams (August 26, 1894 – February 24, 1989) was a professional Major League Baseball player who played with the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, and Cincinnati Reds. At , Adams was the smallest Major League player during his career.

==Career==
===Chicago Cubs===
Adams made his Major League debut with the Cubs on September 18, 1922. He played 11 games during the 1922 season. He spent the following two seasons as the team&#x27;s shortstop, splitting time at the position with Charlie Hollocher. In the 1923 season, he hit four home runs in 311 at-bats for the season, then went on to hit only five the following 5,246 at-bats of his career. The 1925 season became his breakthrough, as he became a second baseman as a result of a trade that sent George Grantham to Pittsburgh, leaving the second base position open. As a hitter, he finished the season with 26 stolen bases, eight triples, and 627 at-bats, which led the National League. As a fielder, he led all second basemen in putouts, assists, and fielding average for the season.

In 1926, Adams increased his batting average to .309, and stole a career-high 27 bases, second-best in the National League. He also played all 154 games of the season, finished first in at-bats for the second year in a row with 624, and finished first in plate appearances with 700. The 1927 season saw Adams being used mainly as a utility infielder, although he started nearly every game. He played 60 games at second base, 53 at third base, and 40 at shortstop. He led the league in at-bats for the third year in a row with 647, and stole 26 bases for the third year in a row.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
The 1927 season marked the end of Adams&#x27; time in Chicago. On November 28, 1927, Adams was traded, along with Pete Scott, to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Kiki Cuyler. Manager Joe McCarthy was criticized for the move, as the Cubs has plenty of outfield strength, but lacked a solid infield presence. It was also considered a good move for Pittsburgh, with sportswriters picking the Pirates to finish first the National League in 1928. He was given the starting second baseman job for the 1928 season. Adams took the place of George Grantham, so was moved to first base, the second time that Adams forced Grantham to another infield position. However, his batting average began to decline, and by the 1929 season, Adams was being used as a utility infielder. At the end of the season, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased his contract from the Pirates after two seasons of playing in Pittsburgh.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
As the 1930 season began, Adams was given the starting third baseman job. He went on to have a career high batting average of .314, and hit a career high nine triples. Adams played all six games in the 1930 World Series, hitting .143 as the Cardinals ended up losing the series. That season, every Cardinals player with over 300 at-bats had a batting average over .300, the only time in history this has happened. The 1931 season ended up being a career year for Adams. He was first in the league in doubles with 46, and had over 600 at-bats for the fourth season. Adams also placed in MVP voting, finishing ninth with 18 votes. He played 143 games over the season; however, an injury in September caused him to miss postseason time. Adams was injured on September 20 when, after winning a bunting and running contest before the game, he sprained his ankle while taking part in the baserunning challenge. He played two games as the Cardinals won the 1931 World Series. Adams was the last surviving member of the 1931 World Champion Cardinals. The following season, he only played 31 games due to injury.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On May 7, 1933, Adams was traded along with Paul Derringer and Allyn Stout to the Cincinnati Reds for Leo Durocher, Dutch Henry, and Jack Ogden, after playing only eight games for the Cardinals that season. He became the starting leadoff man during the 1933 season, as he had been for the other teams he played for. During the 1934 season, as primarily a backup to Mark Koenig, Adams was used as the backup second baseman and third baseman. At the end of the season, Adams was released, then retired at the end of the 1935 season.

After his retirement, he became a farmer and a service station operator in Tremont, Pennsylvania.

When he died in Pottsville, Pennsylvania on February 24, 1989, he was the last remaining player of the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1931 World Series.

==Career statistics==
In 1,424 games over 13 seasons, Adams posted a .286 batting average (1,588-for-5,557) with 844 runs, 249 doubles, 48 triples, 9 home runs, 394 RBI, 154 stolen bases, 453 bases on balls, .343 on-base percentage and .353 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .963 fielding percentage playing at second base, third base, shortstop and several games in the outfield. In the 1930 and &#x27;31 World Series, he was unproductive, hitting only .160 (4-for-25) with only one RBI.

<text>Don Stephen Senanayake (; ; 20 October 1884 – 22 March 1952) was a Ceylonese statesman. He was the first Prime Minister of Ceylon, having emerged as the leader of the Sri Lankan independence movement that led to the establishment of self-rule in Ceylon. He is considered as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;.

Born to an entrepreneur from the village of Botale, Senanayake was educated at S. Thomas&#x27; College, Mutwal before briefly working as a clerk in the Surveyor General&#x27;s Department. Joining the family business, he managed the family estates and the Kahatagaha Graphite Mine. Along with his brothers, Senanayake became active in the temperance movement which grew into the independence movement following 1915 Sinhalese-Muslim riots, in which the Senanayake brothers were imprisoned without charges for 46 days. He was elected unopposed in 1924 to the Legislative Council of Ceylon from Negombo, becoming the Secretary of the unofficial members group of the Legislative Council. In 1931, he was elected to the State Council of Ceylon, where he served as Minister of Agriculture and Lands. He was elected to the first Parliament of Ceylon forming a government and serving as Ceylon&#x27;s first Prime Minister from 1947 until his death in 1952.

==Early life and education==

He was born in the village of Botale in the Hapitigam Korale (currently known as Mirigama) on 20 October 1884 to Don Spater Senanayake (1847–1907) and Dona Catherina Elizabeth Perera Gunasekera Senanayake (1852–1949). Spater Senanayake had made his fortune in graphite mining and at the time he was expanding into plantations and investments in the arrack renting franchise. Later he would be awarded the title of Mudaliyar for his philanthropy. Stephen Senanayake had two elder brothers, Don Charles &quot;D. C.&quot; Senanayake and Fredrick Richard &quot;F. R.&quot; Senanayake; and one sister, Maria Frances Senanayake who married F. H. Dias Bandaranaike.

Brought up in a devout Buddhist family, he entered the prestigious Anglican school S. Thomas&#x27; College, Mutwal. Never a studious student, he excelled in sports playing cricket and played in the Royal-Thomian. He later played cricket for the Sinhalese Sports Club and Nondescripts Cricket Club. His contemporaries at S. Thomas&#x27;s includes D. R. Wijewardena, Sir Paul Pieris, Sir Arthur Wijewardena and Sir Francis Molamure.

==Early career==
After completing schooling, he worked as a clerk in the Surveyor General&#x27;s Department but left after a period of apprenticing. He joined his brother D. C. Senanayake in running his father&#x27;s extensive business holdings. He worked as a planter, introducing the new commercial crop of rubber to the family plantations. He managed the Kahatagaha Graphite Mine, which was owned by his brother F. R. Senanayake wife&#x27;s family. F. R. Senanayake had married the youngest daughter of Mudaliyar Don Charles Gemoris Attygalle. He was a member of the Low-Country Products Association and of the Orient Club. In 1914, he was appointed as a member of a government commission sent to Madagascar to study and report on their graphite mining industry.

==Political career==
===Early political activism===
The three Senanayake brothers were involved in the temperance movement formed in 1912. When World War I broke out in 1914 they joined the Colombo Town Guard. The brothers were arrested and imprisoned without charges during the 1915 riots. They faced the prospect of execution, since the British Governor Sir Robert Chalmers considered the temperance movement as seditious. He was released on a bail bound after 46 days at the Welikada Prison without charges. The heavy-handed suppression of the riots by the British colonial authorities initiated the modern independence movement led by the educated middle class. Don Stephen and Don Charles were prominent members of the political party Lanka Mahajana Sabha. Fredrick Richard and Don Charles were committed supporters of the Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist Association. D. S. Senanayake played an active role in the independence movement, initially in support of his brother Fredrick Richard.

===Legislative Council===
In 1924, Senanayake was elected unopposed to the Legislative Council of Ceylon from Negombo. He became the Secretary (similar to a whip) of the unofficial members group of the Legislative Council, activity engaged in proceedings with a particular interest in subjects related to agriculture, lands, and irrigation. He questioned in the Legislative Council the biased policies of the colonial administration in the plantain industry, the cost overruns of the Batticaloa line and the Trincomalee line, the delays in the Norton Bridge Dam, and advocated for the establishment of the first university in the island close to Kandy. In 1927, he acted on behalf of Gerard Wijeyekoon in the Executive Council. When his brother F.R. died on a pilgrimage to Buddha Gaya in 1925, Don Stephen assumed his leadership of the independence movement.

===State Council of Ceylon===
In 1931 he was elected to the newly formed State Council of Ceylon representing the Ceylon National Congress. At the first siting of the State Council, he was elected as Minister of Agriculture and Lands to chair the state council committee on Agriculture and Lands.

====Minister of Agriculture and Lands====
As Minister of Agriculture and Lands, he initiated a policy that effectively combated Ceylon&#x27;s agricultural problems, established the &quot;Land Development Ordinance&quot;, and introduced an agricultural policy to counter Ceylon&#x27;s rice problems. This policy earned him respect of many, and he continued to be a minister for fifteen years, having been re-elected in 1936. He also enforced a productivity programme of &quot;Agricultural Modernisation&quot;. He introduced the &quot;Land Bill&quot;, expanded the co-operative movement in Ceylon, and assisted in the founding of the Bank of Ceylon. In 1938, he introduced the &quot;Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance&quot;, establishing the Yala National Park. In 1940, following a heated discussion with the Governor which resulted from the Inspector General of Police refusing to follow a request by the Minister of Home Affairs, Senanayake gave his resignation, which was followed by the other Ministers. The resignations were withdrawn shortly following settlement with the Governor.

====World War II====
At the onset of World War II in the far east, on 1 December 1941 a Civil Defence Department was formed with Oliver Goonetilleke as Commissioner. D. S. Senanayake, as Minister of Agriculture and Lands and a member of the Ceylon war council took an active role in food supply and control. He was tasked with many defence projects, including rapid construction of an airfield at the Colombo Racecourse, which he achieved, making it available for the defence of Ceylon during the Easter Sunday Raid.

During this time a close relationship developed between Senanayake and the deputy commissioner of civil defence, Dr. Ivor Jennings, who was the principal of the Ceylon University College. Dr. Jennings, an expert on constitutional law, subsequently became Senanayake&#x27;s adviser on constitutional reforms aimed at gaining independence for the island.

====Gaining independence====
In December 1942, Senanayake became the Leader of the House and Vice Chairman of the Board of Ministers in the State Council, upon the retirement of Sir Baron Jayatilaka, Minister of Home Affairs. On 26 May 1943, the British Government made the Whitehall Declaration of 1943 on Ceylon constitutional change, which enabled ministers to make submissions. This bypassed the Governor, who called for a commission from the colonial office to halt the activities of the ministers. Senanayake resigned from the National Congress disagreeing with its resolution on independence and instead approached the commission with his proposal of dominion status and they accepted the ministers&#x27; submissions, publishing these in the Sessional Paper XIV of 1944. In 1944, the Soulbury Commission was formed. In 1945, he proceeded to London to meet the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Oliver Stanley. On his arrival in London, he met instead the newly appointed George Hall, who had succeeded Stanley following Labour&#x27;s win in the 1945 general election. He resigned his ministry in 1946 to push for full independence. That year he formed the United National Party (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-Dominion parties.

The granting of independence to India in 1947 and the appointment of Arthur Creech Jones as Colonial Secretary gave a new window for Senanayake to push for his case, using the new constitution that was recommended by the Soulbury Commission. In the negotiations that followed, the British government accepted Senanayake&#x27;s proposals for constitutional change and self-rule. Senanayake presented the Soulbury Constitution to the State Council which voted it in, with only three votes against it.

Parliamentary elections were held from 23 August – 20 September 1947. Senanayake was contested for the first time in the Mirigama electorate, having been elected uncontested in all previous elections. He won the seat by a majority of over 16,000 votes against Edmund Samarakkody of the Bolshevik–Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma. Senanayake&#x27;s party, the UNP, fell short of a majority at the general election but was able to form a government in coalition with the All Ceylon Tamil Congress.

On 24 September 1947 he was invited by the Governor General of Ceylon Sir Henry Moore to form the island&#x27;s first cabinet as its first Prime Minister. On 11 November 1947, Senanayake and Sir Henry signed agreements between Ceylon and Britain including a defence pact and public service agreements that paved the way for independence of Ceylon. The &quot;Independence Bill of Ceylon&quot; was passed in December 1947. On 4 February 1948, Ceylon marked its independence with a ceremonial opening of parliament.

==First prime minister==
With his accession, Senanayake began the process of establishing institutions needed for an independent state. While most domestic institutions existed, Ceylon remained dependent on Britain for trade, defence and external affairs. He turned down a knighthood but maintained good relations with Britain and was the first Ceylonese to be appointed to the Privy Council in 1950.

===National development===
He boldly made plans to spread out the population, and his Gal Oya scheme relocated over 250,000 people. He expanded the agrarian policies he had initiated during his tenure as Minister of Agriculture and Lands, a post now held by his son Dudley Senanayake. With a rapidly expanding population and food shortages faced during the war, Senanayake aimed to increase local food production to be self-sustainable. Renovation of sites of historic importance in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa took place at this time. Senanayake also proposed expansion of hydro-electric power in the island.

===Citizenship===
Senanayake&#x27;s government introduced the Ceylon Citizenship Act which was passed by parliament on 20 August 1948 and became law on 15 November 1948. Only about 5,000 Indian Tamils qualified for citizenship. More than 700,000 people, about 11% of the population, were denied citizenship and made stateless. The bill had been opposed fiercely in Parliament by the Ceylon Indian Congress, which represented the Indian Tamils, and the Sinhalese leftist parties, as well as the All Ceylon Tamil Congress, which represented the Sri Lankan Tamils, including its leader G.G. Ponnambalam. This was followed by the &quot; Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949&quot; and the &quot;Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act No.48 of 1949&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
Senanayake held the portfolio of Ministry of External Affairs and Defence. He developed Ceylon&#x27;s post-independence foreign policy, establishing formal relations with foreign nations. Initially gaining membership of the Commonwealth and establishing diplomatic ties other member countries, he established diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan. He established the Ceylon Overseas Service to build a cadre of career diplomats. He hosted the Commonwealth Conference of Foreign Ministers, held in Colombo in January 1950. One of the significant outcomes of this conference was the establishment of the Colombo Plan.

===Defence===
Although Ceylon had maintained a small volunteer force for the defense of colony, Senanayake introduced the Army Act (1949), Navy Act (1950), and the Air Force Act (1951) establishing the Armed forces of Ceylon. Having engaged in Defence Agreement with Britain when gaining independence, Senanayake retained British bases in Ceylon and gained her assistance in training and arming its new military.

===Political challenges===
In the early years of Senanayake&#x27;s premiership he faced opposition and a lot of criticism from many of the leftist parties. He soon had difficulties with one of the strongest members of his cabinet and leader of the largest factions of his party, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Bandaranaike joined his Sinhala Maha Sabha in forming the UNP in 1947, having given the impression that Senanayake would soon retire and he would succeed him. With no signs of Senanayake retiring and conflicts with Senanayake on hardline nationalist policies he had, in 1951, Bandaranaike resigned from his posts, dissolved the Sinhala Maha Sabha, and established the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Senanayake assumed the portfolio of Health and Local Government held by Bandaranaike and began countering his break in parliament for the next few months.

==Death==
On the morning of Friday, 21 March 1952, Don Stephen Senanayake took his usual pre-breakfast ride on Galle Face Green, a short distance from his official residence Temple Trees. He was riding one of his favorite horses, &quot;Chitra&quot;, a mare belonging to the mounted police. Accompanying him on that day was Sir Richard Aluwihare, the IGP; G.G. Ponnambalam, a cabinet minister, and Inspector Eddie Grey. The horse broke into a gallop from a canter and went on for a mile, when suddenly the Prime Minister fell off the saddle.

He was taken to a nursing home where he remained unconscious for the next thirty-two hours. It was believed that he had suffered a stroke. He was treated by Dr. M. V. P. Pieris, Ceylon&#x27;s seniormost surgeon, and a team of Professors from the University of Manitoba who had been visiting Ceylon as part of a WHO medical mission. A radio message was sent for Sir Hugh Cairns, who decided to fly out to Ceylon to attend the Prime Minister. Winston Churchill ordered an RAF Hastings with a double crew to take Sir Hugh. However, the aircraft, with three more doctors and two nurses, was taxiing to take off when the message was received that it was too late, as the Prime Minister&#x27;s situation was deteriorating. Two more neurosurgeons from India and Pakistan had reached Colombo too late to make a difference. Senanayake died at 3:30 pm on 22 March 1952.
His remains were taken to Temple Trees, where they lay until the next morning, when they were moved to the House of Representatives to lay in state, with over half a million persons showing their respects. His state funeral followed with over 32,000 people taking part in the funeral procession and with the stage barring the coffin drawn by sailors of the Royal Ceylon Navy. The procession ended at Independence Square where the remains were cremated in accordance with Sinhalese Buddhist rites.

==Personal life==
Senanayake cared for animals and owned a wide range of pets such as elephants, horses, pigs, cattle; many kept at his estate and at the Bothale Walawwa. A keen horticulturist, he grew orchids and would typically wear an orchid in the lapel of his suit. He suffered from diabetes most of his later life.

===Marriage and children===
D. S. Senanayake married Molly Dunuwila in 1910. She was the daughter of R. R. Dunuwila, then secretary of the Colombo Municipal Council and Grace Jayatilaka, daughter of Frederick Jayatilaka of the Ceylon Civil Service and District Judge of Kalutara. They had two sons, Dudley Shelton Senanayake (19 June 1911 – 13 April 1973) and Robert Parakrama Senanayake (8 April 1913 – 26 April 1986). His eldest son, Dudley Shelton Senanayake, succeeded him as Prime Minister in 1952, followed by his nephew, Sir John Kotelawala (1897–1980) in 1953, but this nine-year family dynasty ended with the landslide victory of Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike in 1956, campaigning under the &quot;Sinhala Only&quot; slogan. Dudley Senanayake regained the premiership brefly in 1960, and served again from 1965 to 1970. Rukman Senanayake, one of his grandsons, served as a cabinet minister and member of parliament. Two of his great-grandsons, Vasantha Senanayake, and Ruwan Wijewardene, served as state ministers and members of parliament.

==Legacy==
D. S. Senanayake is respected by Sinhalese and some Muslims. However, Tamils were not happy with his citizenship laws, which disenfranchised virtually all Tamils of recent Indian origin living in the central highlands. His bold agricultural plans and pro-Western policies drew criticism for their modern and untraditional nature. Under his family&#x27;s leadership, Sri Lanka&#x27;s economy flourished, and he is still known as &quot;The Father of Sri Lanka&quot;.

Statues of D. S. Senanayake have been erected in many parts of the island, including one at the Independence Memorial Hall and at the Old Parliament Building, Colombo. The lake created by the Gal Oya Dam has been named as the Senanayake Samudraya after him. Many schools, libraries and public buildings have been named in his honor and the &quot;Rt Hon D S Senanayake Memorial Shield&quot; is awarded at the Royal–Thomian in which he played for S. Thomas&#x27; in 1901 and 1902.

<text>The Romance of Atlantis is a fantasy novel by Taylor Caldwell about the ancient, erudite, and very advanced civilisation of Atlantis.

Caldwell wrote this novel when she was twelve years old, and had attempted to publish it through her grandfather&#x27;s publishing company, but he accused her of plagiarism because it seemed impossible that a twelve-year-old could have written such an advanced book, and it was not published until 1975, when Caldwell revised it with the assistance of Jess Stearn, and it was finally actually published. Caldwell based this book on a recurring dream she was having every night for about 2 years, each night the dream beginning where it ended the previous night. The dream was so real, that she began to believe that it was her real life.

==Plot summary==
Atlantis is ruled by the beautiful and intelligent Empress Salustra. The fate of the Empire will be decided by an arranged marriage with the ruler of a less advanced, semi-barbarian northern kingdom, as the advanced technology of Atlantis is powerless against strange environmental and ecological disasters.

<text>Les Boubou Macoutes was the popular nickname of special inspectors who investigated and visited the homes of those suspected of welfare fraud in the Canadian province of Quebec during the second government of Premier Robert Bourassa, in the 1990s.

The phrase derives from a combination of &quot;Boubou&quot;, the popular nickname of Robert Bourassa, and the &quot;Tonton Macoutes&quot; – the secret police of Haiti under Papa Doc &quot;(François Duvalier)&quot; and Baby Doc &quot;(Jean-Claude Duvalier)&quot;.

<doc id="891675" wikidata="Q470991" url="?curid=891675" title="Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal">
<text>Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal (, ; August 15, 1928 – May 3, 2002) was a Somali politician who served as the president of Somaliland from 1993 to his death in 2002. He previously served as the prime minister of the State of Somaliland between 26 June and 1 July 1960 and as the first prime minister of the Somali Republic for eleven days in 1960 and again from 1967 to 1969.

==Life and education==
Egal was born in 1928, in Odweyne then a part of British Somaliland. He hails from the Issa Musse sub-division of the Habar Awal clan of Isaaq.

He completed his primary, intermediate, and secondary education in former British Somaliland and then moved to the United Kingdom. Egal was married to Asha Saeed Abby, and together they had three sons and two daughters.

==Career==
===Prime Minister of the State of Somaliland===
On 26 June 1960, Egal was Prime minister of the newly independent State of Somaliland, which merged five days later with the former Trust Territory of Somalia to form the Somali Republic on July 1, 1960.

===Government work===
He served as the first Somali Republic&#x27;s minister of defence (1960–1961), Education Minister (1962–1963), Prime minister (1967–1969), and ambassador to India (1976–1978), although he was imprisoned twice under Barre dictatorship. 

===Prime Minister of the Somali Republic===
In 1967, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was elected President and he appointed Egal as the Prime Minister. The ascension Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal to the role of Prime Minister was reportedly in large part financed by thousands of dollars in covert support to him and other pro-Western elements in the ruling Somali Youth League party by the American Central Intelligence Agency.

He was still the prime minister and in Washington, D.C., when President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated on October 15, 1969. Shortly afterward, the newly established Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) led by Major General Siad Barre, Brigadier General Mohamed Ainashe Gule, Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Korshel seized power. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic, arrested members of the former civilian government, banned political parties, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution. Egal was among the politicians detained by the SRC for his prominent role in the nation&#x27;s early government. He was eventually released and was named the Ambassador to India (1976-1978) before the Barre regime imprisoned him again on charges of conspiracy until 1985.

===President of Somaliland===

Egal managed to successfully disarm and rehabilitate rebel groups, stabilised the north western region and Economy of Somaliland, successfully managed to establish bilateral trade with foreign countries, introduce Somaliland new currency the Somaliland shilling, as well as the Somaliland passport and Somaliland national flag. 

Throughout his term as president of the Republic of Somaliland, Egal&#x27;s dedication to the secessionist cause was doubted and challenged by hardliners, particularly within the Somali National Movement (SNM), who believed that he still ultimately hoped to reconcile with other political actors in the rest of Somalia. In August 2001, Egal survived by one vote a motion tabled by several regional MPs charging him of half-heartedly pursuing separatism. In an interview with IRIN the same year, SNM leader Abdirahman Awale also said of Egal that &quot;when he says he is for independence, it is for local consumption only. He tells the people here one thing, but in his speeches elsewhere he has clearly declared that Somalia will unite one day. He says we will talk to the southerners when they make their home clean and 

negotiate with them... He says one thing to the public, and a different thing to the international community.&quot;

==Death==
Egal died on May 3, 2002, in Pretoria, South Africa while undergoing surgery at a military hospital. His body was returned to Somaliland for a state funeral, whereafter his three sons laid him to rest next to his father, in accordance with his last wishes. Around 4,000 mourners reportedly attended his burial in Berbera, and the regional parliament declared seven days of mourning. Dahir Rayale Kahin was sworn in the next day as the new president.

<text>Clifford Carlton &quot;Gavvy&quot; Cravath (March 23, 1881 – May 23, 1963), also nicknamed &quot;Cactus&quot;, was an American right fielder and right-handed batter in Major League Baseball who played primarily for the Philadelphia Phillies. One of the sport&#x27;s most prolific power hitters of the dead-ball era, in the eight years from 1913 to 1920 he led the National League in home runs six times, in runs batted in, total bases and slugging percentage twice each, and in hits, runs and walks once each. Cravath is almost certainly the first player to hit 200 home runs in affiliated baseball -- 119 in the majors, 107 in the minors and seven in the 1903 &quot;independent&quot; Pacific Coast League. He led the NL in several offensive categories in as the Phillies won the first pennant in the team&#x27;s 33-year history, and he held the team&#x27;s career home run record from 1917 to 1924. He is one of eight players to lead the majors in home runs for a season six times in a career. However, he played his home games at Baker Bowl, a park that was notoriously favorable to batting statistics. Cravath hit 92 career homers at Baker Bowl while he had 25 homers in all his games away from home. Moreover, he was an exceptionally slow base runner; so much so, in fact, that it was actually Cravath about whom sportswriter Bugs Baer famously wrote, &quot;His head was sure full of larceny, but his feet were honest,&quot; a distinction which, along with Cravath&#x27;s extreme lack of foot speed, has long been mistakenly ascribed to Ping Bodie.

==California==
Born in Escondido, California, Cravath was the first baseball player from the San Diego area to play in the major leagues. He began his career during a time of independent minor leagues, when not all good players moved quickly to the majors. He entered professional baseball in 1903 with the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League; during 5 seasons with the team, he helped them win two pennants. He batted .274, .270, .259, .270, and .303, with 7, 13, 9, 6, and 10 home runs, and with 51, 50, 32, 39, and 45 doubles. He led the league in doubles twice (1906 and 1907) and also finished third twice. Although he never led the PCL in home runs, he was second in the league three times, third once, and fourth once during his 5 seasons.

While playing in California, Cravath reportedly picked up his nickname of &quot;Gavvy&quot; by hitting a ball that killed a seagull (&quot;gaviota&quot; in Spanish) in flight. The reporters spelled the nickname &quot;Gavvy&quot; to emphasize that it rhymes with &quot;savvy&quot;, but Cravath himself spelled it &quot;Gavy.&quot;

==Boston, Chicago, Washington, and Minneapolis==
At the end of 1907, Cravath&#x27;s contract was sold to the Boston Red Sox, where he would be a 27-year-old rookie in . His lack of speed was compared unfavorably to Tris Speaker and other swift outfielders of the time; Cravath once said, &quot;They call me wooden shoes and piano legs and a few other pet names. I do not claim to be the fastest man in the world, but I can get around the bases with a fair wind and all sails set. And so long as I am busting the old apple on the seam, I am not worrying a great deal about my legs.&quot; He was hitting .256 with 11 triples in 277 at bats when his contract was sold to the Chicago White Sox in August 1908. After a slow start in Chicago in 1909, he was traded to the Washington Senators, who moved him to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association after only four games.

In Minneapolis, Cravath learned to hit to the opposite field to take advantage of the short (279 ft) right-field line at Nicollet Park. That ability would also serve him well with the Phillies, who had a similar short right-field porch only 272 feet from home plate at the Baker Bowl. The 1910–11 Millers were one of the great minor league teams of all time, and Cravath was their biggest star. In 1910 he led the league in batting average (.326), hits (200), home runs (14), doubles (41), and triples (13). In 1911 he again led the league in the same categories except for triples, with an average of .363, 221 hits, 53 doubles, 13 triples, and 29 home runs.

==Philadelphia==

The rules of the time did not make it easy for Cravath to move back to the majors. Reportedly, it took a clerical error—the Millers inadvertently left out the word &quot;not&quot; in a telegram—to get Cravath back to the major leagues. In his second chance with the Phillies at age 31 in , he proved he was there to stay by hitting .284 with 11 home runs and 70 RBI. He was also a more than adequate outfielder, sharing the league lead with 26 assists.

In 1913 he enjoyed an even better season, leading the NL in hits (179), home runs (19), RBI (128), total bases (298), and slugging (.568); he also placed second in batting with a career-high mark of .341. He placed second in the voting for the Chalmers (MVP) Award behind Jake Daubert, though some historians think Cravath should have won. Other historians disagree citing the fact that his numbers were largely a product of his tiny home park. He repeated as home run champion in , hitting all of his 19 homers in home games, while again sharing the league lead in assists and finishing second in RBI and slugging.

1915 saw his best season as he hit 24 home runs (only 5 home runs away from tiny Baker Bowl), leading the Phillies to their first pennant; he had a 3-run home run in the pennant-clinching game on September 29. He also led the league in runs (89), RBI (115, leading the NL by 28), total bases (266), walks (86), on-base percentage (.393), and slugging (.510, leading the NL by 53 points), and led the NL in assists for the third time. His 24 home runs were the most in the major leagues since Buck Freeman hit 25 for the Washington Senators; he also broke Sam Thompson&#x27;s Phillies franchise record of 20, set in . He later broke Thompson&#x27;s career franchise record; Cravath&#x27;s single-season club mark was surpassed by Cy Williams in , and his career record was broken by Williams in . In the low-scoring 1915 World Series against the Red Sox he hit only .125 (2-16), though he drove in the winning run on a ground out in Game 1, the only Phillies victory. He scored Philadelphia&#x27;s only runs in Games 2 and 4 (both 2–1 losses), and Boston won in five games, outscoring the Phillies 12–10. In Game 5, after the first three Phillie batters reached base, manager Pat Moran gave Cravath the bunt sign on a 3–2 count for unknown reasons; the slugger rolled the next pitch to the pitcher, resulting in a double play.
Regarded as one of the sport&#x27;s pioneer sluggers of the 20th century, Cravath went on to become the first player to win more than five home run titles. However, his home run total was overwhelmingly a product of the hitter-friendly dimensions of his home park with the Phillies, the Baker Bowl; Cravath hit 92 of his 119 career homers in the Baker Bowl. Although his level of play declined gradually after 1915, he again won the home run title in 1917 and 1918. In , at age 38, he had his last outstanding season, winning his sixth home run title with 12 homers (only 2 homers on the road) in just 214 at-bats while hitting .341 (just .291 on the road). In last place midway through the season, the Phillies fired manager Jack Coombs, and Cravath took his place. After he was invited to return as player-manager in , the Phillies improved to 62–91, but ended up in last place again. Cravath was criticized for his easygoing style and was released, ending his major league career; he became player-manager for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League in 1921. He played his final professional games in 1922 with the Minneapolis Millers.

Cravath had a career .287 batting average with 119 home runs, the fourth most in history at the time of his retirement, and 719 RBI in 1220 games. Mel Ott eventually tied his NL record of six home run titles; Ralph Kiner broke the record in with seven; and Mike Schmidt now holds the record of eight titles, set with the Phillies in . Cravath&#x27;s 20th-century record of 119 homers was broken by Babe Ruth in .

==Post-baseball==
Cravath returned to California, where he went into real estate and was elected magistrate judge (Justice of the Peace) in September 1927 in Laguna Beach, California; he died there at age 82. His nephew Jeff Cravath was head football coach at the University of Southern California from 1942 to 1950.

In a June 27, 2004 interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, 7-time &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; game show champion Tom Walsh, who set the record for wins on the program in January 2004 before Ken Jennings came along later that year and won 74 games in a row, said, &quot;I feel like &#x27;Cactus Gavvy&#x27; Cravath. Do you know who that is? Right. Nobody does. He&#x27;s the guy who had the home run record before Babe Ruth came along.&quot;

In 1985, Cravath was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

<text>Serge Chaloff (November 24, 1923 – July 16, 1957) was an American jazz baritone saxophonist. One of bebop&#x27;s earliest baritone saxophonists, Chaloff has been described as &#x27;the most expressive and openly emotive baritone saxophonist jazz has ever witnessed&#x27; with a tone varying &#x27;between a light but almost inaudible whisper to a great sonorous shout with the widest but most incredibly moving of vibratos.&#x27;

==Musical education==
Serge Chaloff was the son of the pianist and composer Julius Chaloff and the leading Boston piano teacher, Margaret Chaloff (known professionally as Madame Chaloff). He learned the piano from the age of six and also had clarinet lessons with Manuel Valerio of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. At the age of twelve, after hearing Harry Carney, Duke Ellington&#x27;s baritonist, he taught himself to play the baritone. Chaloff later explained to Leonard Feather in an interview: &#x27;Who could teach me? I couldn&#x27;t chase [Harry] Carney around the country.&#x27;

Although he was inspired by Carney and Jack Washington, Count Basie&#x27;s baritone player, Chaloff did not imitate them. According to his brother, Richard, &#x27;he could play (baritone) like a tenor sax. The only time you knew it was a baritone was when he took it down low. He played it high...He had finger dexterity, I used to watch him, you couldn&#x27;t believe the speed he played. He was precise. He was a perfectionist. He would be up in his bedroom as a teenager. He would be up by the hour to one, two, three in the morning and I&#x27;m trying to sleep and he&#x27;d go over a phrase or a piece until it was perfect...I used to put the pillow over my head, we had battles.&#x27;

From the age of fourteen, Chaloff, was sitting in at Izzy Ort&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grille a famous live music venue on Essex Street in Boston. Richard Chaloff remembered: &#x27;He didn&#x27;t have a permit to work but he was pretty tall and he went down to see Izzy Ort...and played for him and Izzy liked the sax...and he hired my brother to work nights...My mother used to pray on Sundays that that he&#x27;d make it outa there...My brother sat in with bandsmen that were in their thirties and forties...and here he was fourteen, fifteen years old and he played right along with them, and he did so well that they kept him.&#x27;

==Big bands==
In 1939, aged just sixteen, Chaloff joined the Tommy Reynolds band, playing tenor sax. This was followed by jobs in the bands of Dick Rogers, Shep Fields and Ina Ray Hutton. In July 1944, he joined Boyd Raeburn&#x27;s short-lived big band, where he played alongside Dizzy Gillespie and Al Cohn, who became a lifelong friend. With Boyd Raeburn, in January 1945, he made his first recordings, including &#x27;Interlude&#x27; (Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s &#x27;A Night in Tunisia&#x27;), where his baritone can be heard in the opening section of the song.

While with Boyd Raeburn, Chaloff first heard Charlie Parker, who became his major stylistic influence. Stuart Nicholson argues that, rather than imitating Parker, Chaloff was inspired by his example &#x27;grasping more the emotional basis for Parker&#x27;s playing and using it as a starting point for his own style.&#x27; Richard Chaloff said that his brother &#x27;palled&#x27; with (Parker) in New York. Any time he had the chance he would pal with him. He would sit in with him at night...My brother used to say that he was up till 4,5,6, in the morning with the Bird...All the beboppers found each other out&#x27;

Alongside his 1945-1946 work in big bands led by Georgie Auld and Jimmy Dorsey, Chaloff performed and recorded with several small bebop groups, 1946-1947. These included Sonny Berman&#x27;s&#x27; Big Eight, Bill Harris&#x27;s Big Eight, the Ralph Burns Quintet, Red Rodney&#x27;s Be-Boppers, and his own Serge Chaloff Sextette, which released two 78 records on the Savoy label. Three of the four tunes recorded were written and arranged by Chaloff while the fourth, &#x27;Gabardine and Serge&#x27;, was by Tiny Kahn. &#x27;All four tunes are daredevil cute and blisteringly fast,&#x27; wrote Marc Myers. &#x27;They showcase tight unison lines and standout solos by four of the six musicians, who are in superb form...(On &#x27;Pumpernickel&#x27;) Chaloff shows off his inexhaustible and leonine approach to the baritone sax.&#x27;

Serge Chaloff became a household name in 1947, when he joined Woody Herman&#x27;s Second Herd. This was known as the &#x27;Four Brothers Band&#x27;, after the reed section, comprising Chaloff, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Herbie Steward, and a little later Al Cohn. He was featured on many Herman recordings, including &quot;Four Brothers&quot;, Keen and Peachy&quot;, and had solo features in Al Cohn&#x27;s &quot;The Goof and I&quot;. and &quot;Man, Don&#x27;t Be Ridiculous.&quot; On the latter, he demonstrated &#x27;an astonishing technical facility that was quite without precedent on the instrument.&#x27;

In 1949, Leonard Feather included Chaloff in his book &quot;Inside Be-Bop&quot;: &#x27;Great conception and execution, good taste, clean tone and Bird-like style have made him the No.1 bop exponent of the baritone.&#x27;

==Drug addiction==
By 1947, Chaloff, following the example of his hero, Charlie Parker, was a heroin addict. According to Gene Lees, Chaloff was the Woody Herman band&#x27;s &#x27;chief druggist as well as its number one junkie. Serge would hang a blanket in front of the back seats of the bus and behind it would dispense the stuff to colleagues.&#x27; Whitney Balliett wrote that Chaloff had &#x27;a satanic reputation as a drug addict whose proselytizing ways with drugs reportedly damaged more people than just himself.&#x27; Many musicians blamed him for the drug-related death of the 21-year-old trumpeter Sonny Berman on January 16, 1947.

The trumpeter Rolf Ericson, who joined Herman&#x27;s band in 1950, described the impact of drugs on the band&#x27;s performances: &#x27;In the band Woody had started on the coast...late in 1947, which I heard many times, several of the guys were on narcotics and four were alcoholics. When the band started a night&#x27;s work they sounded wonderful, but after the intermission, during which they used the needle or lushed, the good music was over. It was horrible to see them sitting on the stage like living dead, peering into little paper envelopes when they weren&#x27;t playing.&#x27;

One night in Washington D.C., Woody Herman had a public row on the bandstand with Chaloff. Herman told Gene Lees: &#x27;He was getting farther and farther out there, and the farther out he got the more he was sounding like a fagalah. He kept saying, ‘Hey, Woody, baby, I&#x27;m straight, man, I&#x27;m clean.&#x27; And I shouted, ‘Just play your goddamn part and shut up!&#x27;...I was so depressed after that gig. There was this after-hours joint in Washington called the Turf and Grid...I had to fight my way through to get a drink, man. All I wanted was to have a drink and forget it. And finally I get a couple of drinks, and it&#x27;s hot in there, and I&#x27;m sweating, and somebody&#x27;s got their hands on me, and I hear, ‘Hey, Woody, baby, whadya wanna talk to me like that for? I&#x27;m straight, baby, I&#x27;m straight.&#x27; And it&#x27;s Mr. Chaloff. And then I remember an old Joe Venuti bit. We were jammed in there, packed in, and...I peed down Serge&#x27;s leg. You know, man, when you do that to someone, it takes a while before it sinks in what&#x27;s happened to him. And when Serge realized, he let out a howl like a banshee.&#x27;

Chaloff&#x27;s bandmate, Terry Gibbs, told Ira Gitler stories of his chaotic behaviour: &#x27;He&#x27;d fall asleep with a cigarette all the time and always burn a hole in a mattress. Always! In about twelve hotels. When we&#x27;d go to check out, the hotel owner – Serge always had his hair slicked down even though he hadn&#x27;t taken a bath for three years...the manager would say, &#x27;Mr Chaloff, you burned a hole in your mattress and...&#x27; &#x27;How &quot;dare&quot; you. I&#x27;m the winner of the down beat and &quot;Metronome&quot; polls. How dare you?&#x27;...the manager would always say, &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry Mr Chaloff,&#x27;...Except one time when the band got off on an air-pistol kick...Serge put a telephone book against the door and was zonked out of his bird...he got three shots at the telephone book and made the biggest hole in the door you ever saw. So when he went to the check out, the guy said, &#x27;Mr Chaloff, it&#x27;ll cost you.&#x27;...He &#x27;how-dared&#x27; him a few times. Couldn&#x27;t get away with it. He said &#x27;Well listen, if I&#x27;m gonna pay for the door I want the door.&#x27; It was twenty four dollars. So he paid for the door. I happen to be standing close by. &#x27;Hey Terry,&#x27; he said. &#x27;Grab this,&#x27; and all of a sudden I found myself checking out...We&#x27;re walking out of the hotel with a door.&#x27;

Al Cohn described Chaloff&#x27;s driving: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know how we kept from being killed. Serge would always be drunk. He was quite a drinker. Everything he did, he did too much. So one time we&#x27;re driving, after work. It&#x27;s four o&#x27;clock in the morning, and he makes a left turn, and we&#x27;re wondering why the road is so bumpy. Turned out he made a left turn into the railroad tracks, and we&#x27;re going over the ties.&#x27;

Zoot Sims also talked about Chaloff with Gitler: &#x27;When Serge was cleaned up, you know, straight, he could be a delight, really to be around, a lot of fun. He knew how to handle himself. He had that gift. He could get pretty raunchy when he was strung out, but he could also be charming.&#x27;

In late 1949, when many big bands were folding for economic reasons, Herman broke up the Second Herd. Fronting a new small band in Chicago in 1950, Herman told Down Beat: &#x27;You can&#x27;t imagine how good it feels to look at my present group and find them all awake. To play a set and not have someone conk out in the middle of a chorus.&#x27;

==Count Basie&#x27;s Octet==
For part of 1950, Chaloff played in the All Star Octet of Count Basie who, like Herman, had broken up his big band. The band comprised Basie, Chaloff, Wardell Gray, Buddy DeFranco, Clark Terry, Freddie Green, Jimmy Lewis and Gus Johnson. The group recorded a handful of sides for Victor and Columbia and was also captured on airchecks.

==Return to Boston==
In 1950, Chaloff returned to Boston, where he played in small groups in clubs like the High Hat, Petty Lounge and Red Fox Cafe. A 1950 performance at the Celebrity Club in Providence Rhode Island, was broadcast by WRIV, and has been released on CD as &quot;Boston 1950&quot;. Playing in small groups gave Chaloff the space to develop a new style of playing. In 1951, he talked about &#x27;getting away from the fireworks that don&#x27;t mean anything&#x27; that had been a part of his style up to that point and &#x27;adding more colour and flexibility to his work.&#x27; His friend Al Cohn observed &#x27;It wasn&#x27;t until he left the big bands that he really started to develop as a soloist.&#x27;

Chaloff was now a star, winning the Down Beat and Metronome polls every year from 1949-1953. Yet his drug use and heavy drinking made it difficult for him to keep steady work, and he gave up playing completely in 1952-3.

Chaloff&#x27;s come-back began in late 1953, when the Boston DJ Bob &#x27;The Robin&#x27; Martin offered to become his manager. Helped by Martin, Chaloff formed a new group which played at Boston&#x27;s Jazzorama and Storyville nightclubs. His usual musical partners were Boots Mussulli or Charlie Mariano (alto), Herb Pomeroy (trumpet),and Dick Twardzik (piano). &#x27;He didn&#x27;t work a lot,&#x27; said Bob Martin, &#x27;because the word was out. You had to talk somebody to give him a chance to play. When you got him a gig in a club or a hotel, he would usually mess it up. But when he did show...and got playing...it was,&#x27;Stand back, Baby!&quot;

Jay Migliori, who played with Chaloff at Storyville, recalled, &#x27;Serge was a wild character. We were working at Storyville and, if he was feeling good, he used to let his trousers gradually fall down during the cadenza of his feature, &#x27;Body and Soul.&#x27; At the end of the cadenza, his trousers would hit the ground.&#x27;

==&quot;Serge and Boots&quot; and &quot;The Fable of Mabel&quot;==
In June and September 1954, Chaloff made two recording sessions for George Wein&#x27;s Boston Storyville label, released as two 10&quot; LPs. The first &quot;Serge and Boots&quot; was presented as a joint album with Boots Mussulli, with accompaniment by Russ Freeman (piano), Jimmy Woode (bass) and Buzzy Drootin (drums). Yet George Wein wrote on the sleevenote: &#x27;An alternate title for this album could be &#x27;Serge Returns&#x27;...Each selection in these six was chosen and arranged solely by Serge.&#x27; There were five standards and a Chaloff original, &#x27;Zdot&#x27;, with an ending &#x27;written by a wonderful pianist and teacher, Margaret Chaloff, Serge&#x27;s mother.&#x27;.

On the second Storyville album, &quot;The Fable of Mabel&quot;, Chaloff played in a nine-piece band featuring Charlie Mariano, who composed three of the five originals, and Herb Pomeroy, who provided &#x27;Salute to Tiny&#x27;, dedicated to the drummer and arranger Tiny Kahn. The ambitious title piece was composed by Dick Twardzik, who described it on the sleevenote: &quot;&#x27;The Fable of Mabel&quot; was introduced to jazz circles in 1951-52 by the Serge Chaloff Quartet. Audiences found this satirical jazz legend a welcome respite from standard night club fare. In this legend, Mabel is depicted as a woman who loves men, music and her silver saxophone that played counterpoint (her own invention which proved impractical). The work is divided into three movements: first, New Orleans; second Classical; and third, Not Too Sad An Ending. The soulful baritone solo by Serge Chaloff traces Mabel&#x27;s humble beginnings working railroad cars in New Orleans to her emergence as a practising crusader for the cause of Jazz. During her Paris days on the Jazz Houseboat, her struggle for self-expression is symbolized by an unusual saxophone duet Charlie Mariano and Varty Haritrounian. Mabel always said she wanted to go out blowing. She did.&#x27; The sixth track, Al Killian&#x27;s &#x27;Lets Jump&#x27;, was chosen by Chaloff, who said: &#x27;Now that we&#x27;ve proven how advanced we are let&#x27;s show the people that we can still swing.&#x27;

Just a month after his second Storyville recording, Chaloff went through a personal crisis. In October 1954, with no money and unable to find heroin, he voluntarily entered the drug rehabilitation program at Bridgewater State Hospital. After being hospitalized for three and a half months. he was released in February 1955, finally drug free.

==&quot;Boston Blow-Up!&quot;==

In 1955, Bob Martin persuaded Capitol Records to record a Chaloff LP as part of their &#x27;Stan Kenton Presents Jazz&#x27; series. Chaloff&#x27;s come-back album, &quot;Boston Blow-Up!&quot; was recorded in New York City in April 1955. He was accompanied by Boots Mussulli (alto), Herb Pomeroy (tp), Ray Santisi (p), Everett Evans (b) and Jimmy Zitano (d). Pomeroy, Santisi and Zitano were already a tight unit, regularly playing at Boston&#x27;s Stable Club, where they had recorded a live album &quot;Jazz in a Stable&quot;, on Transition the previous March.

The Kenton connection came about through Mussulli, who had played in his orchestra in 1944-7 and 1952-4. Richard Vacca wrote that &#x27;Chaloff still had his bad boy reputation, and the presence of the steady and reliable Mussulli, who had recorded his own &#x27;Kenton Presents&#x27; LP in 1954, was a great relief to Capitol.&#x27; For the recording, he composed and arranged five new tunes, including &#x27;Bob the Robin&#x27;, dedicated to Chaloff&#x27;s manager. Pomeroy arranged the standards.

Chaloff described the sessions: &#x27;When I came back on the music scene, just recently, I wanted a book of fresh sounding things. I got just what I wanted from Herb and Boots. I think their writing shows us a happy group trying to create new musical entertainment by swinging all the time. Jazz has got to swing; if it doesn&#x27;t, it loses its feeling of expression. This group and these sides are about the happiest I&#x27;ve been involved with.&#x27;

The highlights of the album are Chaloff&#x27;s powerful ballad features, &quot;What&#x27;s New?&quot;, and &quot;Body and Soul&quot;. In the 1956 Metronome Yearbook, Bill Coss described the latter as &#x27;an almost frightening example of Serge&#x27;s form, moaning through a seemingly autobiographical portrayal of (his) Body and Soul&#x27;, an enormously emotional jazz listening experience.&#x27;

Jack Tracy gave &quot;Boston Blow-Up!&quot; five stars in his Down Beat review: &#x27;Serge, for years one of music&#x27;s more chaotic personalities, has made an about face of late and is again flying right. It is evident in his playing, which has become a thing of real beauty...Chaloff offers the best display of his talents ever to be put on wax. It swings, it has heart, it has maturity—it is the long-awaited coalescence of a great talent.&#x27;

&quot;Boston Blow-Up!&quot;&#x27;s favourable reception brought more work for Chaloff, culminating in a performance at the Boston Arts Festival in June 1955. The show was reviewed in the Boston Herald: &#x27;The ingenuity of Chaloff as a soloist is enormous, and his use of dissonance always conveys a sense of purpose and of form. In &#x27;Body and Soul&#x27;, he exhibited his capabilities vigorously, taking a deliberate tempo and treating the music with a lyric, delicate, tonal standpoint...the harmonies of the group are tense and the melodies resourceful and they play with a kind of controlled abandon.&#x27;

In 1956, Chaloff worked his way across the country, usually working in an alto/baritone format. In Chicago, he played alongside Lou Donaldson. In Los Angeles, he played with Sonny Stitt, in a band which also included Leroy Vinnegar, the leading West Coast bassist.

==&quot;Blue Serge&quot;==

Chaloff&#x27;s Los Angeles appearance led to his recording a second Capitol LP there in March 1956. The drummer was Philly Joe Jones, who was in Los Angeles with the Miles Davis Quintet. Sonny Clark played piano, and Leroy Vinnegar was on bass. Chaloff described the making of the record, called &quot;Blue Serge&quot;, on the jacket blurb: &#x27;My last record, &quot;Boston Blow-up!&quot; was one of those carefully planned things...But this time I was feeling a little more easy-going, and I decided to make a record just to blow. I picked out what I felt was the best rhythm section around and told them just to show up...no rehearsals...no tunes set...and trust to luck and musicianship...I&#x27;d never worked with these guys before except for jamming briefy with Joe Jones eight years ago, but I knew from hearing them what they could do...We were shooting for an impromptu feeling and we got it. It has more freedom and spark than anything I&#x27;ve recorded before. And I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better recommendation than that when it comes to honest jazz.&#x27;

Vladimir Somosko, Chaloff&#x27;s biographer, described the results: &#x27;The rapport of the group was as moving as the music, and the net effect was of every note being in place, flawlessly executed, as if even the slightest nuance was carefully chosen for maximum aesthetic impact. This is a level of achievement beyond all but the masters, and from an ensemble that was not even a working group it takes on an aura of the miraculous.&#x27;

Stuart Nicholson analysed Chaloff&#x27;s playing on &quot;A Handful of Stars&quot;: &#x27;Paraphrase becomes central to his performance of &#x27;A Handful of Stars&#x27; where he scrupulously avoids stating the melody as written. At one point he plumbs the baritone for a bumptious bass note and soars to the top of the instrument&#x27;s range in one breath, effortlessly concealing the remarkable technical skill required for such seemingly throw-away trifles. This sheer joy at music making seems to give his playing a life-force of its own.&#x27;

Richard Cook and Brian Morton in &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; declared the album &#x27;Chaloff&#x27;s masterpiece&#x27; and described it as &#x27;vigorous and moving... &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; is overpoweringly beautiful as Chaloff creates a series of melodic variations which match the improviser&#x27;s ideal of fashioning an entirely new song. &#x27;Stairway to the Stars&#x27; is almost as fine, and the thoughtful &#x27;The Goof and I&#x27; and &#x27;Susie&#x27;s Blues&#x27; show that Chaloff still had plenty of ideas about what could be done with a bebopper&#x27;s basic materials. This important session has retained all its power.&#x27;

==Spinal cancer==
Chaloff continued to work on the West Coast, performing at the Starlite Club in Hollywood in May 1956. That month, while playing golf, he was struck down by severe back and abdominal pains, which paralysed his legs. Chaloff flew back to Boston, where an exploratory operation revealed that he was suffering from cancer of the spine. His brother Richard described his final illness: &#x27;We took him down there [Massachusetts General Hospital] and they found he had lesions on his spine...they operated and took most of the lesions away, and then he went on a series of X-ray treatments. Oh they were terrible. He must have had twenty or twenty-five in a row. And in those days they really gave you heavy doses of it. Then occasionally he got spots on the lungs&#x27;

Despite his illness, and the gruelling treatment, Chaloff continued to play live. In New York, on 18 June 1956, a wheelchair-using Chaloff took part in a recording of Charlie Parker&#x27;s &quot;Billie&#x27;s Bounce&quot;, for the Metronome All Stars album. He played alongside Zoot Sims, Art Blakey, Charles Mingus and Billy Taylor.

Chaloff&#x27;s final recording, on 11 February 1957, was for &quot;The Four Brothers... Together Again!&quot; a reunion album of Woody Herman&#x27;s Four Brothers for Vik, a subsidiary of RCA Victor. The Four Brothers lineup was Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Herbie Steward and Chaloff, accompanied by Elliot Lawrence (piano), Buddy Jones (bass) and Don Lamond (drums). On the later recordings, Charlie O&#x27;Kane was brought in to play baritone on the section parts, so Chaloff could preserve his strength for the solos. Here his playing was as strong as ever, especially on &quot;Aged in Wood&quot;, written as a solo vehicle for Chaloff by Al Cohn.

Richard Chaloff: &#x27;He took a wheelchair down to make that recording, you know. They didn&#x27;t think he was going to make it. I heard stories from people there. But when he stood up and played, you never knew he was a sick fellow. He played dynamic. If you listen to the record he sounds like the old Serge. He pulled himself together. I don&#x27;t know how he did it. But he had tremendous drive, tremendous stamina.&#x27;

Don Gold reviewed the album in Down Beat: &#x27;This last session before his death represents a fervent expression of a fatally ill man. It is a kind of significant farewell in the language he knew best.&#x27;

Chaloff made his last live appearances at The Stable Club on Huntington Avenue in Boston the following May. Interviewed in 1993, Charlie &#x27;the Whale&#x27; Johnson recalled Chaloff&#x27;s final performances: &#x27;I remember pushing Chaloff&#x27;s wheelchair into The Stable for his last appearances there. He was in bad shape but could still really play, standing leaning on a pillar. However, he didn&#x27;t have much stamina. He couldn&#x27;t really finish the gig. I also had to go get pot and booze for him. He was still using these steadily, even in the hospital at the end.&#x27;

On 15 July 1957, the dying Chaloff was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital. According to Richard Chaloff, he took his horn and pet monkey with him: &#x27;He still had the kinkajou monkey Mother got him to keep him company. And he had his horn. I was told they wheeled him into a vacant operating theatre so he could practise, and that was his last gig, his last public performance, solo baritone sax alone in an operating theatre. Nurses, doctors and even patients were standing outside and listening. He fought it to the end. Mother would visit him and urge him on, saying, &#x27;You can beat it&#x27; and things. But that last day, they brought a priest to visit him, and the priest saw Serge in bed looking so wasted, and the priest thought he was supposed to perform the last rites. Serge woke up in the middle of it and really panicked, sliding away from him and yelling &#x27;No! No! Get out!&#x27; But after that he seemed to give up. I think that&#x27;s when he realized it was all over.&#x27;

Serge Chaloff died the next day, at the age of 33.

He is buried in the Forest Hills Cemetery, Jamaica Plain, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

<doc id="891686" wikidata="Q1687448" url="?curid=891686" title="Jensen Interceptor">
<text>The Jensen Interceptor is a grand touring car which was hand-built at the Kelvin Way Factory in West Bromwich, near Birmingham in England, by Jensen Motors between 1966 and 1976. The Interceptor name had been used previously by Jensen for the Jensen Interceptor made between 1950 and 1957 at the Carters Green factory. Jensen had extensively used glass-reinforced plastic for the fabrication of body panels in the preceding two decades, but the new Interceptor was a return to a steel body-shell. The body was designed by an outside firm, Carrozzeria Touring of Italy, rather than the in-house staff. The early bodies were built in Italy by Vignale, before Jensen took production in house, making some subtle body modifications.

==Model history and specifications==
Jensen Motors used Chrysler V8 engines for the Interceptor, starting with the 6,276 cc (383 c.i.) with optional manual (Mark I, 22 built) or TorqueFlite automatic transmissions driving the rear wheels through a limited slip differential in a conventional Salisbury rear axle. In 1970, the 383 c.i. produced 335 hp SAE gross, or 270 hp SAE net. Since this engine was detuned by Chrysler for use with low octane petrol, and only produced 250 hp SAE net in 1971, Jensen chose to use the Chrysler engine for 1971.
For 1971, two 440 ci engines were offered. One had a four-barrel carburetor and produced 305 hp SAE net. The other, which had three 2-barrel carburetors and produced 330 hp SAE net, was only available in 1971. Only 232 cars were built with the 440 &quot;six pack&quot;, called the &quot;Jensen SP&quot; (with no &quot;Interceptor&quot; badging) and it had the distinction of being the most powerful car ever to have been made by Jensen.

For 1972, the 440 c.i. engine with three 2-barrel carburetors was no longer produced by Chrysler. The 440 ci engine that remained was detuned to 280 hp SAE net. Chrysler continued to offer a high performance 440 c.i. engine through to 1976 when it only produced 255 hp SAE net.

The Interceptor may have taken some styling cues from the Brasinca Uirapuru, with a distinctive large, curving wrap-around rear window that doubled as a tailgate. The original specification included electric windows, reclining front seats, a wood rimmed steering wheel, radio with twin speakers, reversing lights and an electric clock. Power steering was included as standard from September 1968.

The &quot;Mark II&quot; was announced in October 1969, with slightly revised styling around the headlamps, front grille and bumper and revised rear lights. The interior was substantially revised in order to meet US regulations, and air conditioning was an option.
The &quot;Mark III&quot;, introduced in 1971, revised the front grille, headlamp finishers and bumper treatment again. It had GKN alloy wheels and air conditioning as standard, and revised seats. It was divided into G-, H-, and J-series depending on the production year. The 6.3-litre 383 ci engine was superseded by the 7.2-litre 440 ci in 1971.

Jensen had fallen on hard times by 1975, owing to the then world-wide recession, and to problems with its Jensen-Healey sports car. The company was placed into receivership, and the receivers allowed production to continue until the available cache of parts was exhausted. Production of the Interceptor ended in 1976.

Later, a group of investors trading under the new Jensen Cars Limited brandname stepped in and relaunched production of the 1970s Interceptor, which was briefly re-introduced in the late 1980s as the Series 4 (S4) which was an updated version of the original Interceptor V8 series giving a new lifespan for the Jensen brand and its car production was resumed. The car came back as a low-volume hand-built and bespoke affair, marketed in a similar way to Bristol, with a price of £70,000. Though the body remained essentially the same as the last of the main production run of Series 3, the engine was a much smaller, Chrysler-supplied, 360 cubic inch (5.9-litre) which used more modern controls to reduce emissions comparatively and still producing about 250 bhp. In addition, the interior was slightly re-designed with the addition of modern &quot;sports&quot; front seats as opposed to the armchair style of the earlier models, as well as a revised dashboard and electronics.

The then owner sold up in 1990 to an engineering company believed to be in a stronger position to manufacture the car; this lasted until 1993 with approximately 36 cars built, and while work commenced on development of a new Interceptor Series 5 (S5) for the 1990s however the receivers were called in for a second time and the company was liquidated.

==Variants==
===Jensen FF four wheel drive===

Jensen was one of the first manufacturers to equip a production car with four-wheel drive, in the 1967 Jensen FF (Ferguson Formula). At the time it was hailed as a remarkable development, coming also with Dunlop Maxaret mechanical anti-lock brakes and traction control. The car is five inches (127 mm) longer than the Interceptor. Although looking virtually the same, the extra length can be seen from additional side vent ahead of the doors on the front flanks, and an additional swage line in the leading edge of the front wing. Press articles from the time quote &quot;drag-strip&quot; performance when describing the car. In total 320 FFs were produced; 195 Mark I, 110 Mark II and 15 Mark III.

===SP===
The Jensen SP, with a Six-Pack carburettor system, was launched in 1971, as the company&#x27;s new flagship replacing the FF and was one of the most powerful road cars anywhere in the world. This came with a vinyl roof, Learjet 8-track and a full louvred bonnet as standard. The 440 SP engine with its six pack carburettor produced 385 B.H.P. and a top speed of 147 mph (237 kph). SPs could be more economical than standard four-barrel Interceptors; 16–18 mpg could be achieved. Two hundred thirty-two SPs were made, 219 in RHD and 13 in LHD.

===Convertible===
A convertible with powered soft top was introduced in 1974, mainly intended for the American market but also sold in Europe. Two hundred sixty-seven convertibles were made.

===Coupé===
Rarer still is the Coupé version introduced in 1975; just 60 were made in the one year before the company&#x27;s demise. The coupé was derived from the convertible and therefore lacks the distinctive rear window of the regular car.

===Jensen Interceptor R===
A Jensen specialist JIA based in Banbury Oxfordshire, England, rebuilds original Interceptors using modern components, with General Motors supplied LS 6.2-litre naturally aspirated or supercharged engines and six-speed automatic or manual transmissions.

In May 2010, Jensen International Automotive was set up, with the financial backing of Carphone Warehouse founder and chairman Charles Dunstone who joined its board of directors. A small number of Jensen Interceptor Ss, which had started production under a previous company, were completed by Jensen International Automotive (JIA), in parallel with JIA&#x27;s own production of the new Jensen Interceptor R; deliveries of the latter started at the beginning of 2011.

<text>Naked, published in 1997, is a collection of essays by American humorist David Sedaris. The book details Sedaris’ life, from his unusual upbringing in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, to his booze-and-drug-ridden college years, to his Kerouacian wandering as a young adult. The book became a best-seller and was acclaimed for its wit, dark humor and irreverent tackling of tragic events, including the death of Sedaris’ mother. Prior to publication, several of the essays were read by the author on the Public Radio International program &quot;This American Life&quot;.

&quot;Naked&quot; won the Randy Shilts Award for Gay Non-Fiction from Publishing Triangle in 1998.

==Background==
After the success of his 1994 debut book &quot;Barrel Fever&quot;, David Sedaris was thrust into the public spotlight. He initially held onto his apartment-cleaning job in New York City, but when working on &quot;Naked&quot;, his followup essay collection, he regretfully quit the gig in order to focus on writing. Not wanting to be cooped up at home all day, he wrote the book in a variety of places, including France, Chicago, the Yaddo artists&#x27; community, and the nudist colony that informs the titular essay &quot;Naked.&quot;

Much of &quot;Naked&quot; is about Sedaris&#x27;s childhood and family. When asked how much of it was true, he admitted that he could not perfectly remember twenty-year-old conversations, and that he tended to be prone to exaggeration. However, he operated from the principle that real life was hard to beat when thinking about &quot;really real absurdity.&quot; Although he slightly tweaked his family in his presentation of them, he believed that he needed to start with the honest truth of everything before he blew it up, or else it would feel empty. Sedaris also maintained that his mother was presented &quot;pretty much verbatim,&quot; and that the diary he had been keeping for decades helped him write truthfully about his father.

Sedaris has said that many of the stories he tells in &quot;Naked&quot; came originally from his work with NPR, but he was not allowed to paint any kind of unpleasant mental picture while on the radio. For the book, he thus re-wrote various stories and &quot;put those unpleasant mental pictures back in.&quot;

<doc id="891692" wikidata="Q7889830" url="?curid=891692" title="United States District Court for the Northern District of California">
<text>The United States District Court for the Northern District of California (in case citations, N.D. Cal.) is the federal United States district court whose jurisdiction comprises the following counties of California: Alameda, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and Sonoma. The court hears cases in its courtrooms in Eureka, Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose. It is headquartered in San Francisco. Cases from the Northern District of California are appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Because it covers San Francisco and Silicon Valley, the Northern District of California has become the presumptive destination for major federal lawsuits (such as large class actions and multi-district litigation) involving &quot;Big Tech&quot; defendants.
 These cases usually involve patent law and intellectual property law (such as copyright law and DMCA issues as well as trademark law and trade secret law) - especially in the semiconductor, telecommunications and software industries and other high technology areas, antitrust law, securities law, and technology law in general (&quot;e.g.&quot;, cybersecurity, Internet law, computer law and cases involving software).

== History ==
California was admitted as a state on September 9, 1850, and was initially divided into two districts, the Northern and the Southern, by Act of Congress approved September 28, 1850, 9 Stat. 521. The boundary line was at the 37th parallel of North Latitude. The creating act provided that:

:In addition to the ordinary jurisdiction and powers of a District Court of the United States, with which the Southern District Court of New York has been invested, the said Courts be and hereby are invested respectively within the limits of its district with the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction and power in all civil cases now exercised by the Circuit Courts of the United States; and that in all cases where said Courts shall exercise such jurisdiction, appeals may be taken from the judgments, orders or decrees of said Courts to the Supreme Court of the United States.

The Act of August 31, 1852 made the Judge of the Northern District be Judge of the Southern District as well until otherwise provided, by 10 Stat. 76, 84, effectively creating a single District in all but name until an Act of January 18, 1854 provided for the appointment of a Judge for the Southern District. The Southern District of California was abolished and the State made to constitute a single district – the United States District Court for the District of California – by Act of Congress approved July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 300.

Twenty years later, on August 5, 1886, Congress re-created the Southern District of California by 24 Stat. 308. Erskine M. Ross was appointed Judge of the new district and served until his promotion to the Circuit Judgeship, when he was succeeded by Olin Wellborn. On March 18, 1966, the Eastern and Central Districts were created from portions of the Northern and Southern Districts by 80 Stat. 75.

<doc id="891693" wikidata="Q16386940" url="?curid=891693" title="Me Talk Pretty One Day">
<text>Me Talk Pretty One Day, published in 2000, is a collection of essays by American humorist David Sedaris. The book is separated into two parts. The first part consists of essays about Sedaris’s life before his move to Normandy, France, including his upbringing in suburban Raleigh, North Carolina, his time working odd jobs in New York City, and a visit to New York from a childhood friend and her bumpkinish girlfriend. The second section, &quot;Deux&quot;, tells of Sedaris’s move to Normandy with his partner Hugh, often drawing humor from his efforts to live in France without speaking French and his frustrated attempts to learn it. Prior to publication, several of the essays were read by the author on the Public Radio International program, &quot;This American Life&quot;.

In April 2001, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Sedaris had sold the &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; film rights to director Wayne Wang, who was adapting four stories from the book for Columbia Pictures with hopes of beginning shooting in late 2001. At the time, Sedaris commented, &quot;It&#x27;s just one of those things I had never considered. Like, &#x27;What if I de-clawed a kitten?&#x27; But I like Wayne Wang a lot.&quot; He recommended Jack Lemmon to play his father and Elaine Stritch for his mother. Wang had completed the script and begun casting when Sedaris asked to &quot;get out of it,&quot; after a conversation with his sister aroused concerns as to how his family might be portrayed on screen. He wrote about the conversation and its aftermath in the essay &quot;Repeat After Me&quot;, published in &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim&quot;. Sedaris recounted that Wang was &quot;a real prince. I didn&#x27;t want him to be mad at me, but he was so grown up about it. I never saw how it could be turned into a movie anyway.&quot;

<text>Z-DNA is one of the many possible double helical structures of DNA. It is a left-handed double helical structure in which the helix winds to the left in a zigzag pattern, instead of to the right, like the more common B-DNA form. Z-DNA is thought to be one of three biologically active double-helical structures along with A-DNA and B-DNA.

==History==
Left-handed DNA was first proposed by Robert Wells and colleagues, as the structure of a repeating polymer of inosine–cytosine. They observed a &quot;reverse&quot; circular dichroism spectrum for such DNAs, and interpreted this incorrectly to mean that the strands wrapped around one another in a left-handed fashion. The relationship between Z-DNA and the more familiar B-DNA was indicated by the work of Pohl and Jovin, who showed that the ultraviolet circular dichroism of poly(dG-dC) was nearly inverted in 4 M sodium chloride solution and that the structure of poly d(I–C)·poly d(I–C) was in fact a right-handed D-DNA conformation. The suspicion that this was the result of a conversion from B-DNA to Z-DNA was confirmed by examining the Raman spectra of these solutions and the Z-DNA crystals. Subsequently, a crystal structure of &quot;Z-DNA&quot; was published which turned out to be the first single-crystal X-ray structure of a DNA fragment (a self-complementary DNA hexamer d(CG)3). It was resolved as a left-handed double helix with two antiparallel chains that were held together by Watson–Crick base pairs (see X-ray crystallography). It was solved by Andrew H. J. Wang, Alexander Rich, and coworkers in 1979 at MIT. The crystallisation of a B- to Z-DNA junction in 2005 provided a better understanding of the potential role Z-DNA plays in cells. Whenever a segment of Z-DNA forms, there must be B–Z junctions at its two ends, interfacing it to the B-form of DNA found in the rest of the genome.

In 2007, the RNA version of Z-DNA, Z-RNA, was described as a transformed version of an A-RNA double helix into a left-handed helix. The transition from A-RNA to Z-RNA, however, was already described in 1984.

==Structure==

Z-DNA is quite different from the right-handed forms. In fact, Z-DNA is often compared against B-DNA in order to illustrate the major differences. The Z-DNA helix is left-handed and has a structure that repeats every other base pair. The major and minor grooves, unlike A- and B-DNA, show little difference in width. Formation of this structure is generally unfavourable, although certain conditions can promote it; such as alternating purine–pyrimidine sequence (especially poly(dGC)2), negative DNA supercoiling or high salt and some cations (all at physiological temperature, 37 °C, and pH 7.3–7.4). Z-DNA can form a junction with B-DNA (called a &quot;B-to-Z junction box&quot;) in a structure which involves the extrusion of a base pair. The Z-DNA conformation has been difficult to study because it does not exist as a stable feature of the double helix. Instead, it is a transient structure that is occasionally induced by biological activity and then quickly disappears.

===Predicting Z-DNA structure===
It is possible to predict the likelihood of a DNA sequence forming a Z-DNA structure. An algorithm for predicting the propensity of DNA to flip from the B-form to the Z-form, &quot;ZHunt&quot;, was written by P. Shing Ho in 1984 at MIT. This algorithm was later developed by Tracy Camp, P. Christoph Champ, Sandor Maurice, and Jeffrey M. Vargason for genome-wide mapping of Z-DNA (with Ho as the principal investigator).

=== Pathway of formation of Z-DNA from B-DNA ===

Since the discovery and crystallization of Z-DNA in 1979, the configuration has left scientists puzzled about the pathway and mechanism from the B-DNA configuration to the Z-DNA configuration. The conformational change from B-DNA to the Z-DNA structure was unknown at the atomic level, but in 2010, computer simulations conducted by Lee et al. were able to computationally determine that the step-wise propagation of a B-to-Z transition would provide a lower energy barrier than the previously hypothesized concerted mechanism. Since this was computationally proven, the pathway would still need to be tested experimentally in the lab for further confirmation and validity, in which Lee et al. specifically states in their journal article, &quot;The current [computational] result could be tested by Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments in the future.&quot; In 2018, the pathway from B-DNA to Z-DNA was experimentally proven using smFRET assays. This was performed by measuring the intensity values between the donor and acceptor fluorescent dyes, also known as Fluorophores, in relation to each other as they exchange electrons, while tagged onto a DNA molecule. The distances between the fluorophores could be used to quantitatively calculate the changes in proximity of the dyes and conformational changes in the DNA. A Z-DNA high affinity binding protein, hZαADAR1, was used at varying concentrations to induce the transformation from B-DNA to Z-DNA. The smFRET assays revealed a B* transition state, which formed as the binding of hZαADAR1 accumulated on the B-DNA structure and stabilized it. This step occurs to avoid high junction energy, in which the B-DNA structure is allowed to undergo a conformational change to the Z-DNA structure without a major, disruptive change in energy. This result coincides with the computational results of Lee et al. proving the mechanism to be step-wise and its purpose being that it provides a lower energy barrier for the conformational change from the B-DNA to Z-DNA configuration. Contrary to the previous notion, the binding proteins do not actually stabilize the Z-DNA conformation after it is formed, but instead they actually promote the formation of the Z-DNA directly from the B* conformation, which is formed by the B-DNA structure being bound by high affinity proteins.

==Biological significance==
A biological role for Z-DNA in the regulation of type I interferon responses has been confirmed in studies of three well-characterized rare Mendelian Diseases: Dyschromatosis Symmetrica Hereditaria (OMIM: 127400), Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (OMIM: 615010) and Bilateral Striatal Necrosis/Dystonia. Families with haploid ADAR transcriptome enabled mapping of Zα variants directly to disease, showing that genetic information is encoded in DNA by both shape and sequence. A role in regulating type I interferon responses in cancer is also supported by findings that 40% of a panel of tumors were dependent on the ADAR enzyme for survival.

In previous studies, Z-DNA was linked to both Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. To showcase this, a study was conducted on the DNA found in the hippocampus of brains that were normal, moderately affected with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and severely affected with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Through the use of circular dichroism, this study showed the presence of Z-DNA in the DNA of those severely affected. In this study it was also found that major portions of the moderately affected DNA was in the B-Z intermediate conformation. This is significant because from these findings it was concluded that the transition from B-DNA to Z-DNA is dependent on the progression of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Additionally, Z-DNA is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through the presence of naturally occurring antibodies. Significant amounts of anti Z-DNA antibodies were found in SLE patients and were not present in other rheumatic diseases. There are two types of these antibodies. Through radioimmunoassay, it was found that one interacts with the bases exposed on the surface of Z-DNA and denatured DNA, while the other exclusively interacts with the zig-zag backbone of only Z-DNA. Similar to that found in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, the antibodies vary depending on the stage of the disease, with maximal antibodies in the most active stages of SLE.

=== Z-DNA in transcription ===
Z-DNA is commonly believed to provide torsional strain relief during transcription, and it is associated with negative supercoiling. However, while supercoiling is associated with both DNA transcription and replication, Z-DNA formation is primarily linked to the rate of transcription.

A study of human chromosome 22 showed a correlation between Z-DNA forming regions and promoter regions for nuclear factor I. This suggests that transcription in some human genes may be regulated by Z-DNA formation and nuclear factor I activation.

Z-DNA sequences upstream of promoter regions have been shown to stimulate transcription. The greatest increase in activity is observed when the Z-DNA sequence is placed three helical turns after the promoter sequence. Furthermore, using micrococcal nuclease-crosslinking technique, Z-DNA is unlikely to form nucleosomes, which are often located before and/or after a Z-DNA forming sequence. Because of this property, Z-DNA is hypothesized to code for the boundary in nucleosome positioning. Since the placement of nucleosomes influences the binding of transcription factors, Z-DNA is thought to regulate the rate of transcription.

Developed behind the pathway of RNA polymerase through negative supercoiling, Z-DNA formed via active transcription has been shown to increase genetic instability, creating a propensity towards mutagenesis near promoters. A study on &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; found that gene deletions spontaneously occur in plasmid regions containing Z-DNA-forming sequences. In mammalian cells, the presence of such sequences was found to produce large genomic fragment deletions due to chromosomal double-strand breaks. Both of these genetic modifications have been linked to the gene translocations found in cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, since breakage regions in tumor cells have been plotted around Z-DNA-forming sequences. However, the smaller deletions in bacterial plasmids have been associated with replication slippage, while the larger deletions associated with mammalian cells are caused by non-homologous end-joining repair, which is known to be prone to error.

The toxic effect of ethidium bromide (EtBr) on trypanosomas is caused by shift of their kinetoplastid DNA to Z-form. The shift is caused by intercalation of EtBr and subsequent loosening of DNA structure that leads to unwinding of DNA, shift to Z-form and inhibition of DNA replication.

=== Discovery of the Zα domain ===
The first domain to bind Z-DNA with high affinity was discovered in ADAR1 using an approach developed by Alan Herbert. Crystallographic and NMR studies confirmed the biochemical findings that this domain bound Z-DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. Related domains were identified in a number of other proteins through sequence homology. The identification of the Zα domain provided a tool for other crystallographic studies that lead to the characterization of Z-RNA and the B–Z junction. Biological studies suggested that the Z-DNA binding domain of ADAR1 may localize this enzyme that modifies the sequence of the newly formed RNA to sites of active transcription. A role for Zα, Z-DNA and Z-RNA in defense of the genome against the invasion of Alu retro-elements in humans has evolved into a mechanism for the regulation of innate immune responses to dsRNA. Mutations in Zα are causal for human interferonopathies such as the Mendelian Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome.Additionally, Zα domains are demonstrated to localize at the stress granules because of their innate ability in binding nucleic acid. Furthermore, different Zα domains bind to the Z conformation of nucleic acid differently providing important avenues for specific targeting in drug discovery.

=== Consequences of Z-DNA binding to vaccinia E3L protein ===
As Z-DNA has been researched more thoroughly, it has been discovered that the structure of Z-DNA can bind to Z-DNA binding proteins through van der Waal forces and hydrogen bonding. One example of a Z-DNA binding protein is the vaccinia E3L protein, which is a product of the E3L gene and mimics a mammalian protein that binds Z-DNA. Not only does the E3L protein have affinity to Z-DNA, it has also been found to play a role in the level of severity of virulence in mice caused by vaccinia virus, a type of poxvirus. Two critical components to the E3L protein that determine virulence are the N-terminus and the C-terminus. The N-terminus is made of up a sequence similar to that of the Zα domain, also called Adenosine deaminase z-alpha domain, while the C-terminus is composed of a double stranded RNA binding motif. Through research done by Kim, Y. et al. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it was shown that replacing the N-terminus of the E3L protein with a Zα domain sequence, containing 14 Z-DNA binding residues similar to E3L, had little to no effect on pathogenicity of the virus in mice. In Contrast, Kim, Y. et al. also found that deleting all 83 residues of the E3L N-terminus resulted in decreased virulence. This supports their claim that the N-terminus containing the Z-DNA binding residues is necessary for virulence. Overall, these findings show that the similar Z-DNA binding residues within the N-terminus of the E3L protein and the Zα domain are the most important structural factors determining virulence caused by the vaccinia virus, while amino acid residues not involved in Z-DNA binding have little to no effect. A future implication of these findings includes reducing Z-DNA binding of E3L in vaccines containing the vaccinia virus so negative reactions to the virus can be minimized in humans.

Furthermore, Alexander Rich and Jin-Ah Kwon found that E3L acts as a transactivator for human IL-6, NF-AT, and p53 genes. Their results show that HeLa cells containing E3L had increased expression of human IL-6, NF-AT, and p53 genes and point mutations or deletions of certain Z-DNA binding amino acid residues decreased that expression. Specifically, mutations in Tyr 48 and Pro 63 were found to reduce transactivation of the previously mentioned genes, as a result of loss of hydrogen bonding and london dispersion forces between E3L and the Z-DNA. Overall, these results show that decreasing the bonds and interactions between Z-DNA and Z-DNA binding proteins decreases both virulence and gene expression, hence showing the importance of having bonds between Z-DNA and the E3L binding protein.

<doc id="891699" wikidata="Q3339032" url="?curid=891699" title="Nickel Plate Road">
<text>The New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad , abbreviated NYC&amp;St.L, was a railroad that operated in the mid-central United States. Commonly referred to as the &quot;Nickel Plate Road&quot;, the railroad served parts of the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Its primary connections occurred in Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and Toledo.

The Nickel Plate Road was constructed in 1881 along the South Shore of the Great Lakes to connect Buffalo and Chicago, in competition with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. At the end of 1960, NKP operated of road on of track, not including the of Lorain &amp; West Virginia. That year it reported 9.758 billion net ton-miles of revenue freight and 41 million passenger-miles.

In 1964, the Nickel Plate Road and several other midwestern carriers were merged into the larger Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W). The goal of the N&amp;W expansion was to form a more competitive and successful system serving 14 states and the Canadian province of Ontario on more than of railroad. In 1982, the profitable N&amp;W was itself combined with the Southern Railway, another profitable carrier, to form Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS).

==History==
===Background===
In the 25 years after the American Civil War, railway track mileage in the United States more than doubled, changing the face of America. Rail transportation meant that products made in the East could be shipped West for far less than previously. This allowed for economies of scale and larger, more efficient factories. The agricultural heartland of America was no longer confined to a market of a single day&#x27;s wagon ride. Railroad and railroad construction became one of the largest industries. By 1881, one out of 32 people in the United States was either employed by a railroad or engaged in railroad construction.

Starting about 1877, two great railroad developers, William H. Vanderbilt and Jay Gould, began competing for the railroad traffic along the south shore of the Great Lakes. By 1878, William Vanderbilt had a monopoly on rail traffic between Buffalo, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Chicago, because he owned the only railroad linking those cities - the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. In addition, he was the richest man in America at that time. By 1881, Jay Gould controlled about 15% of all U.S. railroad mileage, most of it west of the Mississippi River and he was considered the most ruthless financial operator in America. Gould&#x27;s major railroad east of the Mississippi River was the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway (Wabash). The Wabash mainline ran from St. Louis, Missouri, to Toledo, Ohio, where it was forced to deliver its railroad traffic to William H. Vanderbilt&#x27;s Lake Shore Railroad for delivery to the eastern United States.

Jay Gould and William Vanderbilt together oversaw all east–west rail traffic in the mid-west. The Seney Syndicate, owners of a railroad, the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, were interested in tapping new sources of revenue. The stage was set for the creation of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad.

===Early years===
The Seney Syndicate, headed by banker George I. Seney, met at Seney&#x27;s New York City bank and organized the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company on February 3, 1881. The original proposal for the NYC&amp;StL was a railroad west from Cleveland, Ohio, to Chicago, Illinois, with a branch to St. Louis, Missouri.

On April 13, 1881, the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company bought the Buffalo, Cleveland and Chicago Railway, a railroad that had been surveyed from the west side of Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, New York, running parallel to William Vanderbilt&#x27;s Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway.

The idea of an east–west railroad across northern Ohio was very popular with the people of Ohio. They wanted to break the high freight rates charged by Jay Gould and William Vanderbilt. No one was less popular in Ohio than William Vanderbilt since the December 29, 1876, collapse of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway&#x27;s Ashtabula River trestle, where 64 people had been injured and 92 were killed or died later from injuries.

Another reason for the popularity of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway was the positive economic impact on any cities that a new railroad went through. During a newspaper war to attract the NYC&amp;St.L, the Norwalk, Ohio, &quot;Chronicle Newspaper&quot; referred to it as a &quot;... double-track, nickel-plated railroad.&quot; The railroad adopted the nickname and it became better known as the Nickel Plate Road.

It was decided that building would start along the surveyed route between Cleveland and Buffalo rather than build the branch to St. Louis. Five hundred days later, the Nickel Plate&#x27;s single-track mainline from Buffalo to Chicago was complete. The railroad was estimated to require 90,000 long tons (80,000 metric tons) of steel rails, each weighing 60 pounds per linear yard (30 kg/m) and 1.5 million oak crossties. Additionally, the railroad required 49 major bridges. It was characterized by long sections of straight track, mild grades, and impressive bridges. The Nickel Plate ran its first trains over the entire system on October 16, 1882.

During construction, Vanderbilt and Gould had watched with great interest. If either of them could acquire the Nickel Plate, they could end the threat to their railroads. If the Nickel Plate remained independent it would be able to create a substantial dent in both entrepreneurs&#x27; railroad earnings.

Vanderbilt tried to lower the value of the Nickel Plate by organizing a campaign to smear its reputation before a train ever ran on its tracks. If Vanderbilt was successful, he could scare the Seney Syndicate into selling to him or drive the railroad company into bankruptcy. However, Vanderbilt&#x27;s plan came with two important risks. If he slandered the line, he risked chasing the Seney Syndicate into an alliance with Gould. The other risk was that his plan to smear the Nickel Plate&#x27;s reputation might fail and it could quickly grow. Vanderbilt claimed the road was being built with substandard materials and it would use unsafe practices once completed. He succeeded in creating long-standing rumors about the line but failed to devalue the company or scare the investors.

The cost of construction was higher than expected and the Seney Syndicate began to negotiate with Gould to purchase the railroad, but unlike Vanderbilt, Gould lacked the capital. Frustrated at the failing talks, Gould broke off negotiations and gave up on his attempt to break Vanderbilt.

===The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern era===
In early 1881, Vanderbilt could have had the Nickel Plate for one million dollars, equal to $ today. He realized if he allowed Gould to gain control of the Nickel Plate, his monopoly on rail traffic from Toledo, Ohio to the east would be broken. He decided he would do anything to keep the Nickel Plate out of Gould&#x27;s hands.

On October 25, 1882, (a few days after the first trains ran) the Seney Syndicate sold the Nickel Plate to Vanderbilt for $7.2 million, equal to $ today. Vanderbilt transferred it to his Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. However, Vanderbilt had a problem: he could not run the business into the ground or it would fall into receivership and someone else would buy it. He could not close the Nickel Plate either because it cost a fortune to buy. So, the Nickel Plate Road did business, but just enough to keep it solvent. By the advent of the 1920s, the Nickel Plate was an obscure line that earned its keep through the transfer of freight from other rail connections. During the same period Vanderbilt&#x27;s Lake Shore and Michigan Southern prospered and expanded.

Vanderbilt kept most of the rail traffic on his Lake Shore and Michigan Southern. Fewer trains on the Nickel Plate meant that they could move faster, so that is the railroad traffic they went after. By 1888 the Nickel Plate had been dubbed &quot;The Meat Express Line.&quot; Observers at Fort Wayne, Indiana, reported six long meat trains every night and a couple of fruit trains during the day.

Vanderbilt consolidated many of his railroads into the New York Central Railroad. Over time, the Nickel Plate was reduced as a serious threat to the New York Central and other competing lines.

Unlike many railroads that established a primary repair shop site, the Nickel Plate maintained several &quot;back shops&quot; that were more or less equal in size. By the late 1800s, facilities that could handle major locomotive and car rebuilding were located at Stony Island Yard (outside of Chicago); Frankfort, Indiana; and Conneaut and Bellevue, Ohio. By the 1920s the shops had been consolidated primarily to Fort Wayne, Indiana; Conneaut, Ohio; Bellevue, Ohio; and Stony Island.

===The Van Sweringen era===
The Van Sweringen brothers of Cleveland, Ohio, were the next owners of the Nickel Plate. Oris Paxton Van Sweringen and his younger brother Mantis James Van Sweringen were real estate developers who had constructed a rapid transit line from their development at Shaker Heights, Ohio, to downtown Cleveland. As early as 1909, the Van Sweringen brothers proposed a stub-end terminal on Public Square in downtown Cleveland. The Cleveland interurbans and traction companies were in favor of the new terminal and right-of-ways leading to it.

The Nickel Plate was the key. It traversed Cleveland from east to west, had a high level crossing of the Cuyahoga River Valley, and was adjacent to the proposed terminal. The Nickel Plate also provided a natural route to the proposed terminal for the Van Sweringen&#x27;s rapid transit and the other traction lines.

Between 1890 and 1913, Cleveland had a fourfold increase in population. Civic and political leaders wanted to clean up the city and started many projects. One was a desire to consolidate all of Cleveland&#x27;s railroad stations. The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Big Four Railroad shared a crowded lakefront Union Station. The Erie Railroad, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Nickel Plate Road, and the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad all occupied separate stations on the north bluff of the Cuyahoga River, just south of downtown. The city also encouraged the railroads to build grade separation throughout the city. The Nickel Plate started a grade separation project on the East Side of Cleveland in 1909 and finished in 1913. Cleveland approved a bond issue in 1910 to &quot;depress&quot; the Nickel Plate through the most congested part of the West Side.

The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway was controlled by the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s Alfred Holland Smith, a close friend of the Van Sweringens. He had guided the Van Sweringens and even financed their rapid transit to Shaker Heights. In late 1915, the Attorney General of the United States advised the New York Central that its control of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern and the Nickel Plate was in violation of the Federal antitrust laws. On February 1, 1916, Alfred Smith called his friends, the Van Sweringens, and offered them the Nickel Plate. They bought it for $8.5 million on April 13, 1916, equal to $ today. In return for operating concessions and access to certain stations, they put up only a little over $500,000 (equal to $ today) but they controlled 75% of Nickel Plate&#x27;s voting stock.

The Van Sweringens had no intention of running the Nickel Plate. Alfred Smith was happy to give the Van Sweringens a vice-president of the New York Central, John J. Bernet, and some of his top men. Smith wanted to show that the Van Sweringens were not New York Central puppets, and the Nickel Plate needed to earn money to retire the $6.5 million in notes owed to the New York Central.

===NKP president John Bernet era===
During Bernet&#x27;s reign, the Nickel Plate grew substantially. In 1922, the Nickel Plate purchased the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, giving it access to Sandusky, Ohio, and Peoria, Illinois. Later that year, on December 28, the Nickel Plate purchased the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad, also known as the &quot;Clover Leaf Route&quot;, finally giving the Nickel Plate access to the St. Louis area, as well as to the port in Toledo, Ohio.

Bernet also doubled the railroad&#x27;s total freight tonnage and average speeds system wide, while cutting fuel consumption in half. Bernet left the Nickel Plate in late 1926.

Bernet returned to the Nickel Plate in 1933. In 1934, Bernet ordered 15 Berkshire locomotives, which would become legendary with the Nickel Plate. Bernet remained as the president of the company until his death in 1935.

On December 29, 1937, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway gained control of the Nickel Plate. One major factor was Frank Allen Brown, who was the assistant superintendent at this time. Brown held this position from 1937 to 1944.

===World War II and post-war era===
During World War II, the Nickel Plate, like all other American railroads, found itself helping with the war effort. The Nickel Plate ordered an additional 55 Berkshires during the war.

After the war, in 1947, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ended its control of the Nickel Plate when it sold off its remaining shares. That year, the Nickel Plate also ordered 11 ALCO PA diesel-electric locomotives, named the &quot;Bluebirds&quot;. These were the first locomotives for the Nickel Plate that were not painted black since the early 1900s.

In 1949, the Nickel Plate received its last Berkshire, #779, also the last steam locomotive built by the Lima Locomotive Works. Later that year, on December 1, the Nickel Plate leased the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway.

In 1960, the last steam locomotive was retired from service, officially &quot;dieselizing&quot; the Nickel Plate.

====Passenger service====
The Nickel Plate had a few long-distance night trains, whose names varied according to whether the train was west-bound or eastbound. The trains linked at Lackawanna Station in Buffalo to continue to Hoboken, New Jersey.
*No. 5 &quot;City of Chicago&quot; (westbound) / No. 6 &quot;City of Cleveland&quot; (eastbound) (Chicago-Cleveland-Buffalo)
*No. 7 &quot;Westerner&quot; (westbound) / No. 8 &quot;New Yorker&quot; (eastbound) (Chicago-Cleveland-Buffalo)
*No. 9 &quot;Blue Arrow&quot; (westbound) / No. 10 &quot;Blue Dart&quot; (eastbound) (St. Louis-Muncie-Cleveland)

===Merger with N&amp;W, Norfolk Southern===

The financial situation of American railroading continued to decline after World War II as the highway system improved and the US Interstate system was built. The Nickel Plate Road, together with the Wabash and several smaller carriers, merged with the profitable Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W) on October 16, 1964.

N&amp;W had merged with long-time rival Virginian Railway in the Pocahontas coal region in 1959, and grew through the mergers with other rail carriers including the Nickel Plate and Wabash railroads with operations in adjacent areas of the eastern United States to form a more competitive and successful system serving 14 states and a province of Canada on more than of road.

The profitable N&amp;W was itself combined with the Southern Railway, another profitable carrier, to form Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) in 1982.

==Chicago terminals==
By 1897 the Nickel Plate had obtained trackage rights over the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway from Grand Crossing to its own terminal on the east side of the LS&amp;MS line to LaSalle Street Station, just north of 12th Street (now Roosevelt Road). By 1928 it used LaSalle.

==Origin of the Nickel Plate nickname==
In an address given to the Newcomen Society of the United States in Erie, Pennsylvania, on November 11, 1954. Lynne L. White (a former president of the Nickel Plate) said:

:&quot;Through northern Ohio, already served by four railroads, location of the line developed intense rivalries among cities. Three routes were surveyed and communities along each proposed route vied in the raising of public subscriptions to donate rights-of-way. The road&#x27;s general offices at Cleveland frequently were besieged by delegations hoping to bring about the routing of the line through their communities. During these inter-city rivalries was born the nickname for the New York, Chicago and St. Louis - The Nickel Plate Road - which rapidly became the name most commonly used.&quot;

:&quot;Numerous legends have grown about when and how the name &quot;Nickel Plate&quot; was first applied. The accepted version is that it appeared first in an article in the Norwalk, Ohio, &quot;Chronicle&quot; of March 10, 1881. On that date the Chronicle reported the arrival of a party of engineers to make a survey for the &quot;great New York and St. Louis double track, nickel plated railroad.&quot;&quot;

:&quot;Later, while attempting to induce the company to build the line through Norwalk instead of Bellevue, Ohio, the Chronicle again referred to the road as &quot;nickel plated&quot; - a term regarded as indicative of the project&#x27;s glittering prospects and substantial financial backing.&quot;

:&quot;In 1882, the Nickel Plate recognized F.R. Loomis, owner and editor of the &quot;Norwalk Chronicle&quot;, as originator of the term and issued him Complimentary Pass No. 1.&quot;

:&quot;Thus Norwalk named the road - but Bellevue finally got it.&quot;

To continue the tradition and preserve the history and name of the Nickel Plate Road, HGR Industrial Surplus, current owner of the former General Motors Fisher Auto Body site in Euclid, Ohio, on the Nickel Plate Road line dedicated its site as &quot;Nickel Plate Station&quot; on October 1, 2015.

==Heritage unit==

On March 28, 2012, Norfolk Southern unveiled NS 8100, a GE ES44AC locomotive painted in the paint scheme found on Nickel Plate Road&#x27;s diesel locomotives. It was the third of twenty units to be painted in the colors of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s predecessors.

<text>Manuel Pinto da Costa (born 5 August 1937) is a Santomean economist and politician who served as the first president of São Tomé and Príncipe from 1975 to 1991. He again served as president from 2011 to 2016.

==Life and career==

Educated in East Germany, he is fluent in Portuguese and German. Until the early 1990s the MLSTP maintained extensive relations with Angola and the MPLA, with Pinto da Costa himself having enjoyed a friendly relationship with José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, extending back to when they were both young men.

In 1991, the legalisation of opposition political parties led to the country&#x27;s first election under a democratic system. Pinto da Costa did not contest the election and instead announced he would retire from politics. The MLSTP did not present an alternative candidate and Miguel Trovoada was elected unopposed. Despite his previous declaration, Pinto da Costa returned to contest elections in 1996, but was narrowly defeated, taking 47.26% of the vote, by Trovoada. In 2001, he ran against incumbent president Fradique de Menezes, who won a majority in the first round.

Pinto da Costa was elected leader of the MLSTP in May 1998. He resigned from the party in February 2005 and Guilherme Posser da Costa was elected to succeed him.

In the July 2011 presidential election, he ran as an independent. He won the most votes in the first round but failed to receive the required majority. In a run-off round on 7 August, he defeated rival Evaristo Carvalho from the Independent Democratic Action party (, ADI), taking 53% of the votes. During the campaign, he focused on the need for political stability and promised to tackle widespread corruption. His bid was given the backing of most of the other major candidates, including former Prime Minister Maria das Neves, who claimed &quot;Pinto da Costa&#x27;s plan could bring more hope to our country&quot;. Some analysts, however, raised concerns that the former president&#x27;s victory might trigger a return to the authoritarian rule seen during his previous period in power. He took office on 3 September 2011.

In 2016 election he qualified for the second round, but then boycotted the second round, so he stepped down and the opposition won.

<text>Shane Lance Deacon (May 28, 1929 – March 29, 2019), known professionally as Shane Rimmer, was a Canadian actor and screenwriter who spent the majority of his career in the United Kingdom. The self-proclaimed &quot;Rent-A-Yank&quot; of the British entertainment industry, he appeared in over 160 films and television programmes from 1957 until his death in 2019, usually playing supporting North American characters.

Among his best known roles were the voice of Scott Tracy in the original &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; series, Air Force Captain &quot;Ace&quot; Owens in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, Joe Donnelli and Malcolm Reid on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Edward R. Murrow in &quot;Gandhi&quot;, and Louie Watterson on the Cartoon Network series &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot;. He appeared in several James Bond films. He made several on-stage appearances for the Royal National Theatre, and wrote scripts for &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Joe 90&quot;.

==Early life==
Rimmer was born Shane Lance Deacon in Toronto, Ontario to a British mother, Vera (née Franklin), and an Irish father, Thomas Deacon, who was a journalist. He had a younger sister, Noreen. He adopted his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name Rimmer and began his career on Canadian radio as a singer and disc jockey before becoming a television presenter.

==Career==

===Film===
Rimmer appeared mainly in supporting roles, especially in films and television series produced in the United Kingdom. He emigrated to England in 1959, after initially performing as a cabaret singer.

His appearances include roles in films such as &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), &quot;Crusoe&quot; (1989), &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001) and &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005).

During his career, Rimmer appeared uncredited in, among other films, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980). He also is believed to have provided the voice for the character Hamilton (played by Robert Dix) in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973).

===Television===
Rimmer had a long-running association with TV producer Gerry Anderson, including the series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (1964–1966). He was the voice actor behind the character of Scott Tracy. He drafted the story for the series&#x27; penultimate episode, &quot;Ricochet&quot; (1966), from which writer Tony Barwick penned a script. Rimmer thought the studio rates for voices in those days were &quot;absolutely deplorable&quot;. Years after working on &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, Rimmer, along with fellow Anderson associate Matt Zimmerman, retained a solicitor. They informed him of the level of payment they received, and the solicitor then gained Rimmer and Zimmerman an immense raise in the residuals. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Danger Man&quot;.

Rimmer also wrote scripts and provided uncredited voices for Anderson&#x27;s subsequent Supermarionation productions &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; (1967–68), &quot;Joe 90&quot; (1968–69) and &quot;The Secret Service&quot; (1969), appeared in episodes of the live-action series &quot;UFO&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Protectors&quot; (1972–74), provided voices for &quot;&quot; (1975–77), and guest-starred in one of its episodes, &quot;Space Brain&quot; (1976). Later, he appeared in the un-televised 1986 pilot &quot;Space Police&quot; (which was adapted as a full TV series and renamed &quot;Space Precinct&quot; in the 1990s, though Ted Shackelford replaced Rimmer for the series) and provided the voice of the title character in &quot;Dick Spanner, P.I.&quot; (1987).

Rimmer and American actor Ed Bishop—himself an Anderson associate–would joke about how their professional paths frequently crossed, calling themselves &quot;Rent-a-Yanks&quot;. They appeared together as United States Navy sailors in &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; (1965) and as NASA technicians in the opening of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), as well as touring together on stage, including a production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; in the 1990s. Rimmer and Bishop also appeared in the BBC drama-documentary &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, which was completed shortly after Bishop&#x27;s death in 2005.

He was the second voice of Louie Watterson in the Cartoon Network series &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot; from 2014 to 2019. The episode &quot;The Agent&quot; was his final role before his death in 2019.

===Other work===
Rimmer appeared once in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (in the 1966 serial &quot;The Gunfighters&quot;), and twice in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;: as Joe Donnelli (from 1968 to 1970), who held Stan Ogden hostage before taking his own life, and Malcolm Reid (in 1988), the adoptive father of Audrey Roberts&#x27; son Stephen. Rimmer was the main character in &quot;Alternative 3 &quot; documentary 1977 hoax ITV Mars landing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmw1R5AsI58 He made many guest appearances in British TV series for ITV, including Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, as well as ITC&#x27;s &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; In 1980, Rimmer played Edward Condon in the BBC mini-series &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, which was rebroadcast in the United States in 1982, and appeared in the 1984 miniseries &quot;Master of the Game&quot;, opposite Dyan Cannon.

In 1989, Rimmer was reunited with Bishop and Zimmerman during the production of a BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;. In 2012, he recorded a reading of Donald Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisation of &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; for release in February 2013.

In 2010, Rimmer returned to the world of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; with a 15-minute fan film simply entitled &quot;Thunderbirds 2010&quot;. He portrays Jeff Tracy in a voiceover on &quot;Thunderbird 3&quot;″s radio, towards the end of the movie, instructing Scott and Alan to take the three astronauts they rescued in the movie to an intact space station, and return to Tracy Island in anticipation of a storm in the Pacific.

Rimmer played the role of Leo Carlin in the 2013 audio drama &quot;The Mighty Carlins&quot; by award-winning Canadian playwright Collin Doyle. The recording was produced by Wireless Theatre Company.

In 2014, Rimmer released his first fiction novel &quot;Long Shot&quot;, through amazon.co.uk/com. This marked his second foray into publishing, having released his autobiography &quot;From Thunderbirds to Pterodactyls&quot; four years previously.

In 2015, he played the role of &quot;Anderson&quot; in the science fiction short &quot;DARKWAVE: Edge of the Storm&quot;; this was released for free online the following year.

==Personal life and death==
Rimmer married Sheila Logan in 1963; the couple had three sons: Damien, Ben and Paul.

Rimmer died at Barnet Hospital in London on 29 March 2019, at the age of 89.

<text>Victor Aldridge (October 25, 1893 – April 17, 1973), nicknamed &quot;the [[Hoosier]] Schoolmaster&quot;, was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Giants, and was known to be an excellent curveball pitcher. Before his playing career he was a schoolmaster, hence his nickname. His most significant actions as a player occurred during the 1925 World Series, where Aldridge completed and won games two and five, only to have the most disastrous first inning in the seventh game of the World Series ever. After his retirement from baseball, he served as a state senator in the Indiana General Assembly. Aldridge is a member of the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame, inducted in 2007.

==Personal life==
Born in the small country town of Cale, Indiana, Vic Aldridge attended the Tempy primary school in Cale, Indiana which was a short walk from his home. He attended high school in Trinity Springs, Indiana where he played baseball on the Trinity Springs team. He graduated from Trinity Springs, Indiana. He then attended Central Normal College in Danville, Indiana. In 1914–1915 he taught school at the Pea Ridge School in Trinity Springs, Indiana. He also taught school in Miami County Indiana. He was married to Cleta B. Wadsworth of Indian Springs, Indiana.

==Early career==
Aldridge was a dependable second or third starter throughout most of his career. He was known for his curveball and pinpoint accuracy. Aldridge batted and threw right-handed. He began his pro career by signing a contract with Indianapolis of the American Association in 1915, but first played for Denver of the Western League and then Erie of the Central League. He played for Indianapolis in 1916 where he was scouted for the Chicago Cubs. He was sold to the Cubs on August 28, 1916.

Aldridge spent 1917 and 1918 with the Chicago Cubs, serving in the bullpen. In 1917 Aldridge played in thirty games, winning six games and losing six, with a 3.12 earned run average and two saves. In 1918 he played only three games, pitching only twelve innings, before joining the United States Navy during the final year of World War I. After returning from the war, he played for the Los Angeles Angels, an affiliate of the Cubs, in the Pacific Coast League. Aldridge returned to the Cubs for the 1922 season. He played the next three years for Chicago, with consistent performances. In 1922, 1923 and 1924 he played 36, 30 and 32 games respectively, with 16, 16 and 15 wins in the three seasons, with respective earned run averages of 3.52, 3.48 and 3.50. During this time his son Vic Aldridge, Jr. served unofficially as the Cubs batboy and even had a uniform donated by Mordecai Brown so he would look the part. In 1923 he was ejected from a game.

==1925==
Vic Aldridge was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 1924 season on October 27, 1924, along with George Grantham and Al Niehaus, for Wilbur Cooper, Charlie Grimm and Rabbit Maranville. The change in stadiums prompted him to rely more on his fastball than his curveball, as he felt he needed to protect himself from home runs in Wrigley Field and its smaller field, thus using the curveball to reduce the risk of being homered against, but the larger field in Pittsburgh made fastballs safer to use, and thus a better pitch to rely upon. The next year, Aldridge won fifteen games (ninth highest total in the National League in 1925) and lost seven, for a .682 winning percentage that was the fourth highest for any NL pitcher that year. His finest moments were in the postseason that year when he pitched two complete game victories against the Washington Senators as the Pirates won the World Series. He won Game 2 of the series 3–2 on October 8, and Game 5 by a score of 6–3, the first two Pirates wins of the Series. Aldridge used the money from the World Series to buy a home in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Aldridge also started the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining for a week in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet pitching mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success in the first two games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher&#x27;s plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.

==Late career==
The 1925 proved to be the pinnacle of Aldridge&#x27;s career. In 1926 he suffered a record of 10 wins and 13 losses, with a 4.07 earned run average. The year 1927 was better for Aldridge. He won fifteen games, losing only ten, with a 4.25 earned run average. Aldridge also played in the 1927 World Series, losing the second game of the series 6–2 as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig led the New York Yankees to a sweep of the Pirates in four games. He gave up all six runs in the innings he pitched. After several other players had ghostwritten newspaper articles for the Christy Walsh Syndicate, he wrote an article for a Pittsburgh newspaper, who bragged that it was Aldridge himself who wrote it.

After winning 15 games again in 1927, Aldridge expected a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded him to the New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge&#x27;s 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not to give him a raise. He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge&#x27;s record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.

In total, Aldridge pitched 1,601 innings, won 97 games and lost 80, had 102 complete games and a combined earned run average of 3.76. Rogers Hornsby said that Aldridge had one of the three best curveballs he had ever seen, a curveball described by the &quot;Baseball Magazine&quot; as a &quot;hard, sharp-breaking curve&quot; that was one of the best curveballs in all of baseball. He also threw a screwball. His batting average was .229 (133-for-581), a respectable average for a pitcher. He hit two home runs with 60 RBI. Aldridge twice attempted to steal a base, once each in 1922 and 1926, and succeeded both times.

==Post career==
After his playing career ended, Aldridge attended law school at the Voorhees School of Law and served in the Indiana State Senate from 1937 to 1948. He was first elected on November 4, 1936, as a Democrat. He served as a schoolmaster full-time before his baseball career, hence his nickname &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot;.

Aldridge died in Terre Haute at age 79, and is buried in the New Trinity Springs Cemetery of Trinity Springs, Indiana. He was inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame on January 19, 2007, as its 131st member; his granddaughter, Mary Turner, and grandson, Vic Aldridge III, accepted the award on his behalf.

<text>The base course or basecourse in pavements is a layer of material in an asphalt roadway, race track, riding arena, or sporting field. It is located under the surface layer consisting of the &quot;wearing course&quot; and sometimes an extra &quot;binder course&quot;.

If there is a sub-base course, the base course is constructed directly above this layer. Otherwise, it is built directly on top of the subgrade. Typical base course thickness ranges from and is governed by underlying layer properties. Generally made of a construction aggregate, it is spread and compacted to at least 95% relative compaction, thus providing a stable foundation for additional layers of material.

Aggregate base (AB) is typically a mix of different sizes of crushed rock &quot; Aggregate Base, Class 2&quot;, is used in roadways and consists of rock particles of size and less. An aggregate is normally made from newly quarried rock, or it is sometimes allowed to be made from recycled asphalt concrete and/or Portland cement concrete.

<text>Sir John George Melvin Compton, (29 April 1925 – 7 September 2007) was a Saint Lucian politician who became the first prime minister upon independence in February 1979. Having led Saint Lucia under British rule from 1964 to 1979, Compton served as prime minister three times: briefly in 1979, again from 1982 to 1996, and from 2006 until his death in 2007. He cofounded the conservative United Workers Party (UWP) in 1964; he led the party until 1996, again from 1998 to 2000, and again from 2005 to 2007.

==Early life and education==
Compton was born on 29 April 1925 in Canouan, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In September 1939, he was taken to Saint Lucia. While studying law and economics, Compton attended the University College of Wales from 1948 to 1949 and the London School of Economics from 1949 to 1951; he was called to the Bar on 7 August 1951.

== Political career ==

=== Beginnings ===
Compton entered politics in 1954, successfully running for the Micoud/Dennery seat on the Saint Lucia Executive Council as an independent. He became the Council Member for Social Affairs in 1955, and served in this position until the Committee System was replaced by the Ministerial System in 1956. That same year, he joined the Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP). He participated in a sugar workers&#x27; strike in 1957, and was fined for obstructing roads. Re-elected in 1957, Compton became Minister for Trade and Production in 1958; he was also appointed deputy leader of the SLP under George Charles. In 1960 he was reappointed Minister of Trade and Industry when Charles became the first Chief Minister. Although Compton was re-elected in 1961, he chose not to join the Executive Council. Objecting to the SLP&#x27;s new ministers, he left the SLP instead and formed a new party, the National Labour Movement.

In 1964, Compton merged the National Labour Movement with another opposition party, the People&#x27;s Progressive Party, to form the United Workers&#x27; Party (UWP). This new party won the 1964 general election, making Compton the new Chief Minister.

===Administration under British rule, 1964–1979===
In office, Compton worked for Saint Lucia&#x27;s independence from British rule. When Saint Lucia became an Associated State of the United Kingdom on 1 March 1967, a move that placed the Saint Lucian government fully in charge of the island&#x27;s internal affairs, Compton became St. Lucia&#x27;s first and only Premier. At the conference from April to May 1966 that led to this change, Compton sharply criticized the British government for excluding certain issues, and accused it of favoring &quot;second-class citizenship for people of another color&quot;. In 1968, he married Barbara Janice Clarke, with whom he would have five children.

Following the UWP&#x27;s victory in the 1974 election, Compton pushed for negotiations leading to independence, which was achieved on 22 February 1979; Compton became the newly independent nation&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

===As Prime Minister and in opposition, 1979–1996===
A few months after independence in 1979, the UWP was defeated in an election by the SLP, and Compton became Leader of the Opposition. The SLP government collapsed in October 1982, and the UWP won the subsequent election in November 1982; Compton became Prime Minister again. He also held the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance, Planning and Development. He remained in office until he retired in 1996; he was replaced by his chosen successor, Vaughan Lewis. Compton became a legal consultant.

In office, Compton&#x27;s policies were conservative, pro-Western and anti-communist. He also worked for increased regional integration: upon leaving office in 1996, he voiced disappointment that the region&#x27;s population remained a &quot;divided people scattered over the Caribbean Sea&quot;.

=== After 1996 ===
He was re-elected as the leader of UWP in 1998, however, he was replaced as leader by Morella Joseph in 2000. Compton then joined George Odlum to form the National Alliance, which did not have much success in the 2001 elections. 

On 13 March 2005, the UWP elected Compton, then 80 years old, as its leader again at a party convention in Soufriere; he received 260 votes against 135 for Vaughan Lewis.

During the 2006 general election season, Compton parried media concerns about his age and campaigned actively, commenting that it was different from preparing to run in the Olympics. Despite opinion polls forecasting another term for the incumbent St Lucia Labour Party, Compton led the UWP to victory on 11 December 2006. He was elected to the seat from Micoud North over SLP candidate Silas Wilson. He was sworn in as Prime Minister on 15 December. His cabinet was sworn in on 19 December, with Compton as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.
==Illness and death==
On 1 May 2007, Compton was hospitalized in New York City after suffering a series of strokes. He fell ill while visiting a doctor for a normal checkup.

On 16 May, Sports Minister Leonard Montoute, who was also the deputy leader of the United Workers Party, announced that Compton was unable to stand or walk on his own, and that the cabinet was preparing to select a successor.

Compton returned to Saint Lucia on 19 May. He temporarily resumed power in early June to oversee a cabinet reshuffle, in which he remained Prime Minister but gave up the finance portfolio to Acting Prime Minister Stephenson King. King said on 8 June that Compton&#x27;s condition was improving. On 11 July, he attended a meeting with several cabinet ministers, the first time he had done so since the strokes.

In late July, it was announced that Compton would resign by the end of 2007. On 26 August, Compton was admitted to the Tapion Hospital in Castries because he was having trouble breathing due to pneumonia. While there, it was learned that he had suffered another stroke while recovering from the previous strokes. On 1 September, he was flown to Martinique for treatment of his pneumonia. While there, his condition worsened and he was placed on a ventilator. On 4 September, doctors decided that his condition was hopeless; on 5 September, he was returned to the Tapion Hospital in Saint Lucia to die. He died there on 7 September 2007. Acting Prime Minister King declared two weeks of mourning, beginning on 8 September.

A state funeral was held for Compton in Castries, at the Minor Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, on 18 September. Despite Compton&#x27;s Anglican faith, the local Catholic church was used due to the large number of mourners and at the request of Sir John. The funeral services held in Micoud on 16 September and at the Minor Basilica on 18 September were in keeping with the requests of Sir John for his funeral service, including the hymns which were specifically requested by him. He was cremated on 19 September and his ashes spread in the Troumasse River at his estate in Mahaut upon his request.

The John Compton Dam in central Saint Lucia was renamed in his honor.

==Personal life and family==
In 1967 he married Janice Barbara Clarke the daughter of Saint Lucia&#x27;s first Saint Lucian-born Governor, Sir Frederick Clarke. Out of this union, five children were born Janine, Shawn, Maya, Fiona and Nina.

Compton&#x27;s first-born daughter Jeannine Compton-Antoine is a politician. In a by-election held on 26 November 2007, she won John Compton&#x27;s constituency of Micoud North.

The fourth born daughter, Fiona Compton, is a London-based photographer who graduated from London College of Printing in 2005 with a BA in photography. She has worked for different UK publishing houses.

The fifth born, and second to youngest daughter, Nina Compton, is a chef and television star. In 2013, she participated in season 11 of the American reality cooking show &quot;Top Chef&quot;, where she was the runner-up and was voted the &quot;fan favorite&quot;.

<doc id="891715" wikidata="Q868612" url="?curid=891715" title="Skittles (confectionery)">
<text>Skittles are multicolored fruit-flavored lentil-shaped candies produced and marketed by the Wrigley Company, a division of Mars Inc.

Skittles consist of hard sugar shells imprinted with the letter &#x27;S&#x27;, similar to M&amp;M&#x27;s which have the letter &#x27;M&#x27;. The interior consists mainly of sugar, corn syrup, and hydrogenated palm kernel oil along with fruit juice, citric acid, and natural and artificial flavors. Skittles are sold in a variety of flavor collections, such as Tropical, Wild Berry, Smoothie, and Sour.

== History and overview ==
Skittles were introduced in 1971 by Jack Candies, a British distributor for Mars, Incorporated. An animated television advertisement from 1974 bears the logo of the &quot;Galaxy&quot; company and is copyrighted by Jack Candies Ltd. Mars was granted a trademark from the U.S. Patent Office for the name Skittles in 1974.By 1979, Skittles became widely distributed throughout the U.S. In 1982, production of Skittles began in the United States. Mars&#x27; Wrigley division acquired the Skittles company in 2008.

The name of the candy, Skittles, comes from the sports game of the same name, named as such for the resemblance of the sweet to items used in the game.

Skittles&#x27; &quot;taste the rainbow&quot; theme was created by the New York ad agency D&#x27;Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles.
On March 2, 2009, Skittles launched a web-based marketing campaign where the official website became a small overlay with options to view different social media sites in the main area, including its official YouTube channel, a Facebook profile, and a Twitter account. The move was debated by people interested in social media.

In 2009, the production of Skittles ceased using animal-derived gelatin, making them suitable for vegetarians, vegans, and certain religious groups.

Skittles were involved in two political incidents in the 2010s. In the aftermath of the killing of Trayvon Martin, protestors used Skittles, which Martin had reportedly been carrying along with Arizona watermelon fruit-flavored juice drink, as a symbol during rallies. Though Mars&#x27; brief statement of condolences was criticized by some outlets, such as &quot;Adweek&quot;, for being too subdued, Mars&#x27; response in 2016 to a Skittles-based image macro (which was posted by Donald Trump Jr. on his Twitter feed as an analogy for immigration) was praised for its tact and directness. MWWPR said Mars&#x27; responses could influence public relations best practices.

In 2016, Skittles faced controversy over temporarily changing the color of the candies from the signature rainbow appearance to white in support of Pride month, LGBT rights and London Pride. The Wrigley Company, a separate representing party of the Skittles brand, mass-produced the limited-edition colorless candies. Skittles&#x27; rainbow themed packaging had also been altered temporarily to complement the achromatic confectionery within. On the back of each monochrome package, the Wrigley Company included an explanation for the company&#x27;s marketing decision: &quot;So this is kind of awkward, but we&#x27;re just gonna go ahead and address the rainbow-colored elephant in the room. You have the rainbow... we have the rainbow... and usually that&#x27;s just hunky-dory. But this Pride, only one rainbow deserves to be the centre of attention - yours. And we&#x27;re not going to be the ones to steal your rainbow thunder, no siree.&quot; However, the message was met with confusion in some areas, with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; publishing an article titled &quot;Some People Think Skittles&#x27; All-White Pride Candies Are Racist&quot;, exploring the idea that by going all-white, the company failed to acknowledge the diversity defined by the LGBT community.

Every June, Skittles repeats the colorless marketing to spread Pride awareness and raise proceeds for an LGBT charity, such as the Switchboard helpline in the United Kingdom. For the 2020 Pride edition, Skittles changed the candy colors from a rainbow to all gray in the United States, with the tagline &quot;Only one rainbow matters during PRIDE&quot;. However, the white color continued to be used in countries such as the United Kingdom.

Skittles&#x27; marketing has become known for its avant-garde viral marketing techniques, particularly in conjunction with the Super Bowl. In 2018, it produced a Super Bowl commercial that was viewed by only one person. In 2019, it conducted a pre-Super Bowl campaign featuring &quot;Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical&quot;, which was performed one time only at The Town Hall in New York City.

Skittles are commonly used to effectively treat hypoglycemia in diabetics.

The European Union&#x27;s top food regulators found in 2021 that titanium dioxide, an additive found in Skittles, could damage DNA, which in turn could lead to cancer. This resulted in the EU phasing out sale of Skittles and other foods containing titanium dioxide starting February 7, 2022, with a full ban enacted August 7, 2022.

In July 2022, a lawsuit seeking class-action status was filed in California regarding the continued use of titanium dioxide as a coloring agent. The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in November 2022.

In March 2023, Democratic California Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel introduced a bill to the California Assembly that will ban production, sales, and consumption of all foods and drinks (including Skittles, Pez, Sour Patch Kids, Campbell Soup, etc.) that contain titanium dioxide and 4 other harmful additives (which are propylparaben, red dye 3, brominated vegetable oil, and potassium bromate) across the State of California, all five of which have been linked to causing cancer and other health problems and at least three of these five harmful additives are already banned by the European Union from being used in food and drink products. If passed, California will become the first US state to adopt the European Union&#x27;s ban on titanium dioxide and other cancer causing chemical additives from being used in food and drink products.

==Varieties==
Skittles are produced in a wide variety of flavors and colors, including sour varieties. Skittles has hinted at new flavor releases on its Facebook page, using such statuses as &quot;Locking myself in the Rainbow kitchen until I see some results!&quot; A 2011 posting contained confirmation of a new flavor: &quot;Putting the last touches on a new Skittles flavor. Tweak the Rainbow.&quot;

In the United States and Canada, in 2013, Skittles replaced the lime-flavored Skittles with green apple, causing a backlash from many consumers. The lime flavor became part of the Darkside packets, which were discontinued in 2015 and followed up by the Orchards packets, which were discontinued in 2017. Lime was also part of the &quot;Long Lost Lime&quot; packets that came out in summer 2017 and 2018. The Darkside flavor was revived in 2019. In 2021, the &quot;All Lime&quot; packets containing only the lime flavor were released for a limited time. In September 2021, Skittles announced that the green apple-flavored Skittles would be replaced with the original lime flavor. In 2022, Skittles Gummies were released. In October 2024, Skittles released their own version of freeze-dried Skittles called Skittles POP&#x27;d. It comes in two versions Skittles Original flavor and Sour Skittles flavor.

<doc id="891718" wikidata="Q7158786" url="?curid=891718" title="Peconic County, New York">
<text>Peconic County () is a proposed new county on Long Island in the U.S. state of New York that would secede the five easternmost towns of Suffolk County: East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold, plus the Shinnecock Indian Reservation.

It derives its name from Peconic Bay which is the dividing body of water separating the North and South forks of Long Island.

Peconic County has been discussed for more than 50 years – ever since Suffolk County moved its offices from the official county seat in Riverhead 32 miles west to Hauppauge, New York, in more densely populated western Suffolk County.

The big drive for the county was a difference in character between western Suffolk County which is predominantly a New York City bedroom community while the east end (or &quot;East End&quot;) is dominated by home owners who want to preserve the area&#x27;s more rural and upscale character.

In 1997, 71 percent of the east end voters approved a nonbinding resolution to secede. However, the New York State Assembly has never approved the enabling legislation. East End newspapers speculated that the Assembly was afraid that it would encourage a wave of secessions in the state including Staten Island seceding from New York City and perhaps even causing the division of upstate and downstate New York.

The secession movement has not been active in recent years.

==Area and population==
At the 2020 census, the five towns and the Shinnecock Reservation had a land area of 900.581 km (347.72 mi2), or about 38.12 percent of Suffolk County&#x27;s land area. Its total population was 161,127 inhabitants, or about 10.56 percent of the county&#x27;s population. Its average population density was 178.91/km (463.38/mi2). If the proposed secession were to occur, the surviving Suffolk County would have a land area of 1,462.001 km (564.482 mi2) and an adjusted 2020 census population of 1,356,575 inhabitants. It would be left with a population density of 933.51/km (2,417.78/mi2). As can be seen, the western part of Suffolk has more than five times the population density of its eastern neighbor.

<doc id="891719" wikidata="Q5348683" url="?curid=891719" title="Ehud Shapiro">
<text>Ehud Shapiro (; born 1955) is an Israeli scientist, entrepreneur, artist, and political activist who is Professor of Computer Science and Biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science. With international reputation, he made contributions to many scientific disciplines, laying in each a long-term research agenda by asking a basic question and offering a first step towards answering it, including how to computerize the process of scientific discovery, by providing an algorithmic interpretation to Karl Popper&#x27;s methodology of conjectures and refutations; how to automate program debugging, by algorithms for fault localization; how to unify parallel, distributed, and systems programming with a high-level logic-based programming language; how to use the metaverse as a foundation for social networking; how to devise molecular computers that can function as smart programmable drugs; how to uncover the human cell lineage tree, via single-cell genomics; how to support digital democracy, by devising an alternative architecture to the digital realm grassroots.

Shapiro was also an early internet entrepreneur, and a proponent of global digital democracy.

Shapiro is the founder of the Ba Rock Band and a founder of the Israeli political party &quot;Democratit&quot;. He is a winner of two ERC (European Research Council) Advanced Grants.

==Early life and education==
Born in Jerusalem in 1955, Shapiro became acquainted with the philosophy of science of Karl Popper through a high-school project supervised by Moshe Kroy from the Department of Philosophy, Tel Aviv University. In 1979, Shapiro completed his undergraduate studies in Tel Aviv University in mathematics and philosophy. Shapiro&#x27;s PhD work with Dana Angluin in computer science at Yale university attempted to provide an algorithmic interpretation to Popper&#x27;s philosophical approach to scientific discovery, resulting in both a computer system for the inference of logical theories from facts; and a methodology for program debugging, developed using the programming language Prolog. His thesis, &quot;Algorithmic Program Debugging&quot;, was published by MIT Press as a 1982 ACM Distinguished Dissertation, followed in 1986 by &quot;The Art of Prolog&quot;, a textbook co-authored with Leon Sterling.

==Career==
Moving to the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1982 as a post-doctoral fellow, Shapiro was inspired by the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems project to invent a high-level programming language for parallel and distributed computer systems, named Concurrent Prolog. A two-volume book on Concurrent Prolog and related work was published by MIT Press in 1987.

In 1993, Shapiro took leave of absence from his tenured position at Weizmann to found Ubique Ltd. (and serve as its CEO), an early Israeli Internet software startup. Building on Concurrent Prolog, Ubique developed &quot;Virtual Places&quot;, a 2D metaverse and social networking software that included instant messaging, chat rooms, collaborative browsing, online events and games, and voice-over-IP. Ubique was sold to America Online in 1995, and following a management buy out in 1997 was sold again to IBM in 1998.

Shapiro attempted to build a computer from biological molecules, guided by a vision of &quot;A Doctor in a Cell&quot;: A biomolecular computer that operates inside the living body, programmed with medical knowledge to diagnose diseases and produce the requisite drugs. Being a novice to biology, Shapiro realized his first design for a molecular computer as a LEGO-like mechanical device built using 3D stereolithography, which was patented upon his return to Weizmann in 1998. During 1999–2016, Shapiro&#x27;s lab was designing and implementing various molecular computing devices.

In 2011, Shapiro designed an effective method of synthesizing error-free DNA molecules from error-prone building blocks, and founded the CADMAD consortium (Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing of DNA libraries):
In 2005, Shapiro presented a vision of the next grand challenge in human biology: To uncover the &quot;Human cell lineage tree&quot;. The history of how the human body grows from a single cell (the fertilized egg) to 100 trillion cells is captured by the cell lineage tree. In his TEDxTel-Aviv talk &quot;Uncovering The Human Cell Lineage Tree The next grand scientific challenge&quot; Shapiro described the system and results obtained with it so far, and a proposal for a FET Flagship project &quot;Human Cell Lineage Flagship initiative&quot; for uncovering the Human cell lineage tree in health and disease. The international Human Cell Atlas project, initiated by Shapiro&#x27;s former Ph.D. student Aviv Regev, aims to address the precursor question of describing all cell types in the human body.

==Research==
Popper suggested that all scientific theories are by nature conjectures and inherently fallible, and that refutation to old theory is the paramount process of scientific discovery. Shapiro&#x27;s doctoral studies with Angluin attempted to provide an algorithmic interpretation to Popper&#x27;s approach to scientific discovery in particular for automating the &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot; method making bold conjectures and then performing experiments that seek to refute them. Shapiro generalized this into the &quot;Contradiction Backtracing Algorithm&quot; an algorithm for backtracking contradictions. This algorithm is applicable whenever a contradiction occurs between some conjectured theory and the facts. By testing a finite number of ground atoms for their truth in the model the algorithm can trace back a source for this contradiction, namely a false hypothesis, and can demonstrate its falsity by providing a counterexample to it.

Shapiro laid the theoretical foundation for inductive logic programming and built its first implementation (Model Inference System): a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. Inductive logic programming has nowadays bloomed as a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning which uses logic programming as a uniform representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. Recent work in this area, combining logic programming, learning and probability, has given rise to the new field of statistical relational learning.

==Algorithmic program debugging==
Algorithmic debugging was first developed by Shapiro during his PhD research at Yale University, as introduced in his PhD thesis, selected as a 1982 ACM Distinguished Dissertation. Shapiro implemented the method of algorithmic debugging in Prolog (a general purpose logic programming language) for the debugging of logic programs.

In case of logic programs, the intended behavior of the program is a model (a set of simple true statements) and bugs are manifested as program incompleteness (inability to prove a true statement) or incorrectness (ability to prove a false statement). The algorithm would identify a false statement in the program and provide a counter-example to it or a missing true statement that it or its generalization should be added to the program. A method to handle non-termination was also developed. Since then, the approach of algorithmic debugging has been expanded and applied to many programming languages.

==The Fifth Generation Computer Systems project==
The Fifth Generation Computer Systems project (FGCS) was an initiative by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry, begun in 1982, to create a computer using massively parallel computing/processing. It was to be the result of a massive government/industry research project in Japan during the 1980s. It aimed to create an &quot;epoch-making computer&quot; with-supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence.

In 1982, during a visit to the ICOT, Shapiro invented Concurrent Prolog, a novel concurrent programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming. Concurrent Prolog is a logic programming language designed for concurrent programming and parallel execution. It is a process oriented language, which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded-command indeterminacy as its basic control mechanisms.

Shapiro described the language in a Report marked as ICOT Technical Report 003, which presented a Concurrent Prolog interpreter written in Prolog. Shapiro&#x27;s work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project. It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC) by Ueda, which was the basis of KL1, the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language.

==Ubique Ltd.==
In 1993, Shapiro took a leave of absence from the Weizmann Institute to found and serve as CEO of Ubique Ltd., an Israeli Internet software startup. Ubique developed an early 2D metaverse and social networking software that included instant messaging, chat rooms, collaborative browsing, online events and games, and voice-over-IP. The company&#x27;s first product, Virtual Places 1.0, was developed on top of Unix-based workstations and was announced on the same day that Netscape Communications announced it browser and server products. Virtual Places 2.0 was based on Windows 95 and PCs. Ubique was sold to America Online in 1995 for $14.5 million, bought back by its management in 1997, and sold again to IBM in 1998, where Ubique&#x27;s technology was the basis of IBM&#x27;s SameTime instant messaging product.

==Molecular programming languages==
In a paper published in 2002 in Nature magazine &quot;Cellular abstractions: Cells as computation&quot; Shapiro with his Ph.D. student Aviv Regev raised the question: Why can&#x27;t the study of biomolecular systems make a similar computational leap? Both sequence and structure research have adopted good abstractions: ‘DNA-as-string’ and ‘protein-as-three-dimensional-labelled-graph’, respectively. They believed that computer science could provide the much-needed abstraction for biomolecular systems. Together Regev and Shapiro used advanced computer science concepts to investigate the ‘molecule-as-computation’ abstraction, in which a system of interacting molecular entities is described and modelled by a system of interacting computational entities. He developed Abstract computer languages for the specification and study of systems of interacting computations, in order to represent biomolecular systems, including regulatory, metabolic and signaling pathways, as well as multicellular processes such as immune responses.

The work (that initially used the π-calculus, a process calculus) was later taken over by IBM Cambridge in the UK (Luca Cardelli) that developed SPiM (Stochastic Pi Calculus Machine). In the last decade the field has flourished with a vast variety of applications. More recently, the field even evolved to a synthesis of two different fields molecular computing and molecular programming. The combination of the two exhibits how different mathematical formalisms (such as Chemical Reaction Networks) can serve as &#x27;programming languages&#x27; and various molecular architectures (such as DNA molecules architecture) can in principle implement any behavior that can be mathematically expressed by the formalism being used.

==Doctor in a cell==
By combining computer science and molecular biology, researchers have been able to work on a programmable biological computer that in the future may navigate within the human body, diagnosing diseases and administering treatments. This is what Shapiro termed a &quot;Doctor in a cell&quot;. His group designed a molecular-scale computer made entirely of biological molecules that realized a mathematical model of programmable computer termed finite automata, which used its DNA input molecule as fuel. The molecular computer was also recognized in 2003 as a Guinness World Record for the smallest molecular computing device. The molecular computer was then extended with an input and output mechanism so that it can be programmed – in a test tube – to identify molecular changes in the body that indicate the presence of certain cancers, and release a drug molecular in response in case it does. The computer was then able to diagnose the specific type of cancer, and to react by producing a drug molecule that interfered with the cancer cells’ activities, causing them to self-destruct. For this work was a member of the 2004 &quot;Scientific American 50&quot; as Research Leader in Nanotechnology.

In 2009, Shapiro and Ph.D. student Tom Ran presented the prototype of an autonomous programmable molecular system, based on the manipulation of DNA strands, which is capable of performing simple logical deductions. This prototype is the first simple programming language implemented on a molecular-scale. If introduced into the body, this system has immense potential to accurately target specific cell types and administer the appropriate treatment, as it can perform millions of calculations at the same time and &#x27;think&#x27; logically.

Shapiro&#x27;s team aimed to make these computers perform highly complex actions and answer complicated questions, following a logical model first proposed by Aristotle over 2000 years ago. The team has also found a way to make these microscopic computing devices &#x27;user-friendly&#x27; by creating a compiler a program for bridging between a high-level computer programming language and DNA computing code. They sought to develop a hybrid &quot;in silico&quot;/&quot;in vitro&quot; system that supports the creation and execution of molecular logic programs in a similar way to electronic computers, enabling anyone who knows how to operate an electronic computer, with absolutely no background in molecular biology, to operate a biomolecular computer.

In 2012, Shapiro, Tom Ran and students succeeded in creating a genetic device that operates independently in bacterial cells. The device has been programmed to identify certain parameters and mount an appropriate response. The device searches for transcription factors proteins that control the expression of genes in the cell. A malfunction of these molecules can disrupt gene expression. In follow-up research, Benenson and his team have produced a moleciular computer that cures a certain type of cancer in mice, with the goal of producing a cancer drug based on this method.

==DNA editing==
Shapiro designed an effective method of synthesizing error-free DNA molecules from error-prone building blocks. DNA programming is the DNA-counterpart of computer programming. The basic computer programming cycle is to modify an existing program, test the modified program, and iterate until the desired behavior is obtained. Similarly, the DNA programming cycle is to modify a DNA molecule, test its resulting behavior, and iterate until the goal (which is either understanding the behavior or improving it) is achieved.

Shapiro founded the CADMAD consortium, which aimed to deliver a revolution in DNA processing analogous to the revolution text editing underwent with the introduction of electronic text editors.This goal was eventually achieved by others and with a different technology – CRISPR gene editing.

==Human cell lineage tree==
In 2005, Shapiro and students presented a vision of the next grand challenge in Human biology: To uncover the Human cell lineage Tree. Inside each person is a cell lineage tree.

The challenge of uncovering the Human Cell Lineage Tree is reminiscent, both in nature and in scope, to the challenge faced by the Human Genome Project at its inception and, in fact, its results will decisively contribute to the functional translation and ultimate understanding of the genome sequence. A technological leap of a magnitude similar to the one that occurred during the Human Genome Project is required for the success of the human cell lineage project, and the biological and biomedical impact of such a success could be of a magnitude similar, if not larger than that of the Human Genome Project. In his TEDxTel-Aviv talk &quot;Uncovering The Human Cell Lineage Tree The next grand scientific challenge&quot; Shapiro described the system and results obtained with it so far, and a proposal for a FET Flagship project &quot;Human Cell Lineage Flagship initiative&quot; for uncovering the Human cell lineage tree in health and disease. The goal of Human Cell Atlas project launched in 2016 by Shapiro&#x27;s former Ph.D. student Aviv Regev and colleagues, is to identify the cell types in the human body. It is a necessary precursor to identifying the human cell lineage tree.

==Equality in digital democracy==
The Internet has revolutionized almost every domain of human endeavor, but not democracy. Puzzled by this singularity, Shapiro set to explore how an Internet revolution of democracy could take place. Consulting a founding document of modern democracy, the French 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, Shapiro distilled from it the values that would need to be upheld by any digital democracy, with equality being first and foremost.

Subsequently, Shapiro and his team at Weizmann addressed the many dimensions of equality in digital democracy: Equality in voting, via Sybil-Resilient Social Choice [ref], which aims uphold democratic voting despite the penetration of sybils (fake and duplicate identities) into a digital community; equality in proposing; equality in deliberation and coalition formation; equality in constitution formation; and equality in community forking.

==Grassroots digital democracy==
Equality in governance of a digital community is meaningful only it also applies to the platform on which the community operates. The digital realm is dominated today two types of platforms: autocratic server/cloud-based (e.g. Facebook), and plutocratic proof-of-work/stake-based (e.g. Bitcoin/Ethereum), and, and lacks a democratic alternative. To help remedy this, Shapiro presents a third alternative architecture for the digital realm, termed &quot;grassroots digital democracy&quot;. Informally, a distributed system is grassroots if it can have autonomous, independently-deployed instances — geographically and over time — that can interoperate once interconnected. An example would be a servereless smartphone-based social network supporting multiple independently-budding communities that merge when a member of one community becomes also a member of another.

Grassroots applications may allow people to conduct their social, economic, civic, and political lives in the digital realm solely using the networked computing devices they own and operate (e.g., smartphones), free of third-party control, surveillance, manipulation, coercion, or value-extraction (e.g., by global digital platforms such as Facebook or Bitcoin).

Shapiro initiated in 2012 and led the &quot;open party&quot; (later &quot;open community&quot;) project within the Public Knowledge Workshop, which aimed to provide foundations for the operation of an e-party espousing direct democracy via the internet [ref in source]. He further extended his concepts of e-democracy in his 2016 WEF lecture and Financial Times Opinion article. In 2020 he founded the political party Democratit - freedom, equality and fraternity.

<text>Robert Roland Chudnick (September 27, 1927 – May 27, 1994), known professionally as Red Rodney, was an American jazz trumpeter.

==Biography==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he became a professional musician at 15, working in the mid-1940s for the big bands of Jerry Wald, Jimmy Dorsey, Georgie Auld, Elliot Lawrence, Benny Goodman, and Les Brown. He was inspired by hearing Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker to change his style to bebop, moving on to play with Claude Thornhill, Gene Krupa, and Woody Herman. He was Jewish.

He accepted an invitation from Charlie Parker to join his quintet. and was a member of the band from 1949 to 1951. Being the only white member of the group, when playing in the southern United States he was billed as &quot;Albino Red&quot; as a ruse to avoid prejudice against mixed race musical combos. During this time he recorded extensively.

During the 1950s, he worked as a bandleader in Philadelphia and recorded with Ira Sullivan. He became addicted to heroin and started a pattern of dropping in and out of jazz.

During 1969, Rodney played in Las Vegas with fellow Woody Herman colleague, trombonist Bill Harris, as part of the Flamingo casino house band led by Russ Black. Similar work continued through 1972.

In the early 1970s he was bankrupted by medical costs following a stroke. He returned to jazz. In 1975 he was incarcerated in Lexington, Kentucky for drug offenses. While jailed he gave music lessons to guitarist Wayne Kramer of the MC5.
He reunited with Ira Sullivan and performed with Dizzy Gillespie. From 1980 to 1982, Rodney made five albums with Sullivan. On these albums he started to play post bop jazz. He continued to work and record into the 1990s. He performed on a Charlie Parker tribute album by Charlie Watts, drummer for the Rolling Stones. He provided an early showcase for saxophonist Chris Potter, who was a member of his group and only 19 years old when Rodney recorded &quot;Red Alert&quot; in late 1990.

He performed at Jazz at Lincoln Center and the JVC Jazz Festival. He worked as an adviser for &quot;Bird&quot;, a movie about Charlie Parker directed by Clint Eastwood. Michael Zelniker played him in the movie.

Rodney died on May 27, 1994, from lung cancer.

<text>Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw (16 September 1916 – 23 May 1978) was the first Premier of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and previously served as Chief Minister, legislator, and labour activist.

== Early life ==

Bradshaw was born in the Saint Paul Capisterre Village in Saint Kitts to Mary Jane Francis, a domestic servant, and William Bradshaw, a blacksmith. He was raised by his grandmother after his father moved to the United States when Bradshaw was nine months old. He attended St. Paul&#x27;s Primary School and completed seventh grade, the highest level of primary education available in Saint Kitts at the time.

At 16, Bradshaw became a machine apprentice at the St. Kitts Sugar Factory, where he began to take interest in the labour movement. In 1940, he left the sugar factory following a strike for higher wages and joined the St. Kitts and Nevis Trades and Labour Union as a clerk. Bradshaw succeeded Joseph Matthew Sebastian as president of the union in 1944.

In 1963 he married Mildred Sahaley, a Kittitian-Lebanese woman. They had one daughter, Isis Carla Bradshaw. His first daughter, Etsu, is from an earlier relationship.

==Political career==
Bradshaw supported the cause of the sugar workers and was one of the political stalwarts of the country. In 1945 he became president of the recently created St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party. He entered politics in 1946 and won a seat in the Legislative Council in the elections that year, later becoming a member of the Executive Council. In 1956 he was Minister of Trade and Production for St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla. During the short-lived West Indies Federation (from 1958 to 1962), Bradshaw was elected to the Federal House of Representatives and held the post of minister of finance for the West Indies Federation.

After the break-up of the Federation, Bradshaw returned to St. Kitts from Trinidad. In 1966 he became Chief Minister, and in 1967 the first Premier of St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, then an associated state of the United Kingdom. Under his leadership, all sugar lands, as well as the central sugar factory, were bought by the government. Opposition to Bradshaw&#x27;s rule began to build. Opposition was especially great in Nevis, where it was felt that the island was being neglected and unfairly deprived of revenue, investment and services by its larger neighbour. Bradshaw mainly ignored Nevis&#x27; complaints, but Nevisian disenchantment with the Labour Party proved a key factor in the party&#x27;s eventual fall from power. Opposition in Anguilla was even stronger, with the Anguillans evicting St. Kitts police from their island and holding referendums in 1967 and 1969, both times voting overwhelmingly to secede from St. Kitts-Nevis and remain a separate British territory.

In 1977 Bradshaw travelled to London for talks on independence with the British government.

==Death==
Bradshaw died on 23 May 1978 of prostate cancer at his home in Basseterre. He was succeeded by his Deputy Premier, Paul Southwell. He is buried in Springfield cemetery in Basseterre.

==Legacy==
In 1996, Bradshaw was posthumously awarded the title of First National Hero by the National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis and is honoured annually on National Heroes Day, which is observed on his birthday. On the inaugural National Heroes Day in 1998, the Golden Rock Airport in Saint Kitts was renamed the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport in his honor. In 2007, the Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw Memorial Park was dedicated at his birthplace in St. Paul&#x27;s. On 17 September 2010, the Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw building was dedicated on the Windsor University School of Medicine campus in Cayon.

<text>Vallenato () is a popular folk music genre from Colombia. It primarily comes from its Caribbean region. &quot;Vallenato&quot; literally means &quot;born in the valley&quot;. The valley influencing this name is located between the &quot;Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta&quot; and the &quot;Serranía de Perijá&quot; in north-east Colombia. The name also applies to the people from the city where this genre originated: Valledupar (from the place named &quot;Valle de Upar&quot; – &quot;Valley of Upar&quot;). In 2006, vallenato and cumbia were added as a category in the Latin Grammy Awards. Colombia&#x27;s traditional vallenato music is Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, according to UNESCO.

==Origins==

This form of music originated from farmers who, keeping a tradition of Spanish minstrels (&quot;juglares&quot; in Spanish), used to travel through the region with their cattle in search of pastures or to sell them in cattle fairs. Because they traveled from town to town and the region lacked rapid communications, these farmers served as bearers of news for families living in other towns or villages. Their only form of entertainment during these trips was singing and playing guitars or indigenous gaita flutes, known as kuisis in the Kogi language, and their form of transmitting their news was by singing their messages.

The first form of vallenato was played with gaita flutes, guacharaca, and caja, and later adopted other instruments like guitars. These troubadors were later influenced by Europe&#x27;s instruments: piano and accordion. Impressed by the sound of the accordion, troubadors probably later obtained accordions from Aruba and Curaçao. Vallenato was considered music of the lower class and farmers, but gradually started penetrating through every social group during the mid-20th century.

Don Clemente Quintero – a prominent member from the region&#x27;s elite – was a lover of this music, usually accompanied by liquor, was a form of entertainment for this almost isolated region. He then decided to start a &quot;parranda&quot; (party) inside the very strict Valledupar Social Club with friends. This triggered an acceptance for the music and it became a regular feature at parties, carnivals and reunions, not for dancing, but for listening to these juglares stories .

Alfonso López Michelsen, a prominent Colombian politician, showed interest in the region as his ancestors and wife were born there. While a Senator, he pushed for the creation of the Department of Cesar and became, in 1966, its first governor. Once in office and together with writer and reporter Consuelo Araújo Noguera and vallenato composer Rafael Escalona, they created the Vallenato Legend Festival.

==Instruments==
Its three traditional instruments are:
* the &quot;caja vallenata&quot;: a small drum held between the knees and played with bare hands. It was used by the African slaves brought by the Europeans. Similar to a tambora drum.
* the &quot;guacharaca&quot;: a wooden, ribbed stick similar to a sugar cane, accompanied by a fork that when rubbed together emits a scraping sound. It&#x27;s about 18 inches (45 centimeters) long and 1 inch (3 centimeters) in diameter. It was used by the aborigines to imitate the song of the &quot;guacharaca&quot; or (one of the species of chachalaca), a bird from the region, to hunt and perform dancing rites.
* the &quot;accordion&quot;: three-line button, German-origin accordion. It has three reeds per note and comes in different keys: ADG, GCF, and BbEbAb (&quot;5 Letras&quot;). Accordions in Colombia and Panama sometimes have custom made keys especially made for vallenato and cumbia.

==The four rhythms==
Vallenato consists of four beats or &quot;airs&quot; that are differentiated through their rhythmic structure and the melody chord structure the accordionist gives it. These are son, paseo, merengue, and puya. The son and the paseo have a time and the merengue and the puya a time.
* Son is played with heavy accentuation and cadence stressed on the low notes of the accordion on its left-hand side. It is normally mournful and slow.
* Paseo is thought to be an offshoot of the &quot;son&quot;. Its speed can vary and today is the most widely recorded air.
* Puya&#x27;s main difference from the &quot;merengue&quot; is the length of its lyrics. In the last 40 years, accordion players have begun to play it faster, and each of the three instruments used in &quot;vallenato&quot; has a solo. It is considered the oldest of the four &quot;airs&quot;, with roots in an ancient Indian dance of the &quot;Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta&quot;.
* Merengue is often confused with a Dominican genre with the same name, probably brought by related African tribal groups. It has a more narrative style and was often used to play &quot;décimas&quot;, a 10-line format with internal rhymes brought by the Spanish in the 16th century.

==Piqueria==
The piqueria vallenata is a type of typical musical showdown Colombian Caribbean folklore and Vallenato. As in the contrapunteo Joropo burrowing, or trova paisa within the music, litigants demonstrate their improvisational skills in building verses that challenge their opponent. This type of musical confrontation arose as a result of chance encounters between vallenatos minstrels who roamed the northern part of Colombia brightening binges and to demonstrate their talent on the accordion and the art of improvisation faced with songs and rhymes. One of the most important meetings of the Piqueria was between Emiliano Zuleta and Lorenzo Morales, both vallenato accordionists. From this meeting came the popular song &quot;La Gota Fría&quot; (&quot;The Cold Drop&quot; in English), played in its most popular version by Colombian singer Carlos Vives.

==Vallenato festivals==
Many vallenato festivals are held annually in Colombia, such as:
*The Vallenato Legend Festival: Every year by the end of April, in the city of Valledupar, the &quot;Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata&quot; (Vallenato Legend Festival) is celebrated. During the festival a contest takes place in which the best &quot;vallenato&quot; interpreters fight for the title of &quot;Rey Vallenato&quot; (Vallenato accordion King), &quot;verseadores&quot;, new song composers, &quot;guacharaqueros&quot; and &quot;cajeros&quot; are also awarded within three categories; professional, aficionado and infant. The festival also includes record industry&#x27;s orchestras shows.
*Accordions&#x27; Cradle Festival: (Festival cuna de accordeones) This festival is celebrated every year since 1979, in Valledupar&#x27;s neighboring town of Villanueva, in La Guajira. The Festival is similar to the Vallenato Legend Festival format, but also includes a category for the elderly accordion players over sixty years old.
*Other Vallenato festivals
**The Vallenato Festival in Bogotá, Colombia

==Vallenato composers, singers and juglares==
Thanks to the Vallenato Legend Festival, this musical genre became known through the region including regions of Venezuela, and when a popular telenovela, &quot;Escalona&quot;, based on the life of Vallenato composer, Rafael Escalona was aired on national television (with vallenato superstar Carlos Vives as Escalona), vallenato became widely known in Colombia and internationally. Some renowned traditional vallenato performers are Guillermo Buitrago, Alejo Duran, Enrique Díaz, Emiliano Zuleta, Luis Enrique Martínez, Abel Antonio Villa and Lorenzo Morales. Other important characters such as Tobías Enrique Pumarejo and Rafael Escalona never played any instrument, but were important writers of very well known songs across Latin America. Other well-known Colombian musicians who sing vallenatos are Rafael Orozco Maestre, Miguel Morales, Diomedes Díaz, Jorge Oñate, Ivan Villazon, Adanies Díaz, Nicolas &quot;Colacho&quot; Mendoza (accordion player and composer), Juan Humberto &quot;Juancho&quot; Rois (accordion player and composer), Omar Geles (accordion player and composer), Israel Romero, Peter Manjarrés, Silvestre Dangond, Los Gigantes Del Vallenato, Galy Galiano, and Lisandro Meza among others.

The current ambassador of the genre is Carlos Vives, who has progressively helped &quot;vallenato&quot; gain popularity worldwide by combining traditional vallenato music with pop/rock music, subgenre that has come to be known as &quot;vallenato-pop&quot;.

==Vallenato musical orchestras and groups==
The traditional vallenato developed into a more orchestra type of musical group. Throughout the years, some groups started adding instruments and a group chorus to support the main singer, popularly and sarcastically known as &quot;ay omberos&quot;. With these changes. Some of the instruments added or used by some orchestras were: the bass guitar, the congas drums, a Timbal set, drum kit, maracas, guache, electric piano, Spanish guitars, tambourine, cowbell, electric guitar, Saxophone, piano accordion, violins, among others. These groups also started fusioning local genres to the vallenato, usually with cumbia, porro sabanero, gaitas (group of gaita flute interpreters), merecumbe and joropo. Some groups seeking a wider audience started mixing vallenato with other international genres, like salsa, merengue, rock, classical music, reggae, reggaeton, ranchera, techno and house music. Some of these mixes did not become very popular because of their experimental sounds.

=== La Nueva Ola (The New Wave) ===
La Nueva Ola refers to the new generation of vallenato groups and orchestras that have created a distinctive sound for themselves while keeping some of the essences of their predecessors. Kaleth Morales is considered the leading artist of this young wave of vallenato musical groups, even after his death following a car accident on August 24, 2005. The leader is now Silvestre Dangond, who won five awards in Premios Nuestra Tierra in 2009. Other relevant artists are Silvestre Dangond, Peter Manjarrés and Martín Elías.

<text>Amanda Peet (born January 11, 1972) is an American actress. She began her career with small parts on television before making her feature film debut in &quot;Animal Room&quot; (1995). Her portrayal of Jill St. Claire in &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; (2000) brought her wider recognition, and she has since appeared in a variety of films, including &quot;Saving Silverman&quot; (2001), &quot;High Crimes&quot;, &quot;Changing Lanes&quot;, &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; (all 2002), &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, &quot;Identity&quot; (both 2003), &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; (2004), &quot;A Lot like Love&quot;, &quot;Syriana&quot; (both 2005), &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; (2008), &quot;2012&quot; (2009), &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (2010), &quot;Identity Thief&quot;, and &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot; (both 2013).

Outside of film, Peet played Jacqueline Barrett on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Jack &amp; Jill&quot; (1999–2001), Jordan McDeere on NBC&#x27;s short-lived Aaron Sorkin series &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; (2006-2007), Tina Morris on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Togetherness&quot; (2015–2016), Jules on IFC&#x27;s &quot;Brockmire&quot; (2016–2020), Betty Broderick on the second season of Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Dirty John&quot; (2020), and Beth Gallagher in the Paramount+ adaptation of &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (2023). In 2021, she wrote and co-executive produced &quot;The Chair&quot; for Netflix. Peet is married to American screenwriter David Benioff, with whom she has three children.

==Early life==
Peet was born in New York City, the daughter of Penny (née Levy), a social worker, and Charles Peet Jr., a corporate lawyer, who later divorced. Her father is a Quaker and her mother is Jewish; both are also atheists. Peet&#x27;s maternal great-grandfathers were Samuel Levy, a lawyer, businessman, and public official, who served as Manhattan Borough President; and Samuel &quot;Roxy&quot; Rothafel, a theatrical impresario and entrepreneur.

At age seven, Peet relocated with her family to London, returning to New York four years later. She enrolled in HB Studio&#x27;s teen acting program when she was 13. Peet attended Friends Seminary, and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in American history. In college, she auditioned for acting with teacher Uta Hagen and decided to become an actress after taking Hagen&#x27;s class. During her four-year period of study with Hagen, Peet appeared in the off-Broadway revival of Clifford Odets&#x27;s &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; with Stephen Lang.

==Career==
===Early roles and breakthrough (1995–2004)===
Peet&#x27;s first screen performances were in a television commercial for Skittles and an uncredited appearance as the girlfriend of the titular character in the second episode of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; in 1992. Her film debut was in the drama &quot;Animal Room&quot; (1995), which also starred Neil Patrick Harris and Matthew Lillard. She also appeared in the November 1995 episode &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. For much of the late 1990s, Peet maintained a steady acting career in relatively obscure independent films co-starring more established actors. In 1996, for instance, she appeared in &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer, and &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, with Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz. Peet appeared in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; (1998), as part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Angelina Jolie, and Ryan Phillippe. She had her first major role as Jacqueline Barrett in the WB network series &quot;Jack &amp; Jill&quot;, which aired for two seasons, between 1999 and 2001, to moderate success. She appeared in the eighth-season finale of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (&quot;The Summer of George&quot;) as a waitress whom Jerry Seinfeld dates. In 1999, Peet also starred in the fantasy romantic comedy &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot;, opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar. That film was panned by critics and flopped at the box office.

Peet appeared alongside Bette Midler and Nathan Lane in Andrew Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Great&quot; (2000), a highly fictionalized account of the life and career of author Jacqueline Susann. However, her first role in a widely released feature film came later that year, with the part of Jill St. Claire in the mafia comedy film &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot;. The film, which also starred Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert gave it one of the more positive reviews, noting in particular that Peet&#x27;s performance, which he called &quot;perfect&quot;, highlighted the story. &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; was a commercial success, grossing US$106.3 million worldwide. For her performance, she received a Blockbuster Entertainment Award nomination for Favorite Supporting Actress: Comedy, and a Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice Film Liar. In 2000, she played a love interest in the independent comedy &quot;Whipped&quot;, won the Young Hollywood Award for &quot;Best New Style Maker&quot;, and was voted one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World by &quot;People&quot; magazine.

Peet took on the role of a psychologist and the romantic interest of Jason Biggs in the comedy &quot;Saving Silverman&quot; (2001), and portrayed a heroin-addicted trophy mistress in the dramedy &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot;, which garnered acclaim among critics. She also played the wife of a successful, young Wall Street lawyer thriller film &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; (2002), with Ben Affleck. Also in 2002, she played the sister of Ashley Judd in the suspense thriller &quot;High Crimes&quot;, in which Judd and co-star Morgan Freeman take on the military&#x27;s court-martial of Judd&#x27;s husband for murder. In 2003, Peet appeared with Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves in the romantic comedy &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, directed by Nancy Meyers, playing an auctioneer, working for &quot;Christie&#x27;s&quot;. The film was a critical darling and a major success at the box office, grossing US$125 million in North America. In her other 2003 film release, the psychological horror thriller &quot;Identity&quot;, Peet starred as a Las Vegas prostitute, alongside John Cusack, Ray Liotta and John Hawkes. &quot;Identity&quot; received critical acclaim and was a moderate commercial success. In 2004, Peet starred in &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot;. Unlike the first film, this production was critically panned and flopped at the box office.

===Established career (2005–2010)===
Her most significant film role in 2005 was that of a woman who becomes a successful photographer, opposite Ashton Kutcher, in the romantic comedy &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot;, which revolved around two people whose relationship slowly evolves from lust to friendship to romance over the course of seven years. While overall response was mixed, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found Peet to be &quot;charming and charismatic without being cloying or artificial.&quot; In 2005, she also performed in the play &quot;This Is How It Goes&quot;, filling in for Marisa Tomei at the last minute after six days of rehearsal, and appeared in the Woody Allen&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; and the thriller &quot;Syriana&quot;, which was based loosely on former Central Intelligence Agency agent Robert Baer and his memoirs of being an agent in the Middle East.

In 2006, Peet acted on Neil Simon&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, followed by the romantic drama &quot;Griffin &amp; Phoenix&quot;, a remake of the 1976 ABC TV movie, in which she portrayed a terminally ill woman living life to the fullest. The television series &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, which premiered on NBC in late 2006, featured her as the recently hired president of entertainment programming, with Matthew Perry, with whom she had starred in &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; and &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot;, and Sarah Paulson, with whom she previously worked in &quot;Jack &amp; Jill&quot;. For her role, Peet received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. The series got a strong critical reaction to its pilot, but quickly suffered a backlash and was cancelled after one season.

Peet starred as an attorney who stays home to raise a new baby in the romantic comedy &quot;The Ex&quot; (2007), which went unnoticed by critics and audiences. In 2008, she starred in the mystery drama &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; (2008), as an FBI agent, the dramedy &quot;Five Dollars a Day&quot; (2008), as the girlfriend of a seemingly successful man, and the crime drama &quot;What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You&quot;, as the wife of a Boston criminal. &quot;What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You&quot; was her best reviewed film of 2008, with Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, writing that Peet &quot;is terrific as Brian&#x27;s worn-down wife, sick of seeing her man disappear before her eyes.&quot;

In &quot;2012&quot; (2009), a disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich, Peet reunited with John Cusack, to play his estranged wife. While critical response was mixed, the film made over US$769 million worldwide, becoming Peet&#x27;s most widely seen film. In her next film, the dramedy &quot;Please Give&quot; (2010), she starred as a self-centered cosmetologist, with Catherine Keener and Rebecca Hall. It received a limited theatrical release and critical acclaim. Ethan Alter of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; felt that Peet &quot;does career-best work here.&quot; Peet and the other &quot;Please Give&quot; cast members received a Gotham Award nomination for Best Ensemble Cast. In 2010, Peet also provided for one of the main characters of DVD sci-fi adventure film &quot;Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey&quot;, and starred as the love interest of the main character in the live-action family adventure film &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, with Jack Black, Emily Blunt and Jason Segel.

===Roles in television (2011–2020)===
In 2012, Peet headlined the television series &quot;Bent&quot;, as a recently divorced lawyer. She was drawn to the writing, stating: &quot;I thought it was a good repartee. I love a good romantic comedy, and I love a repressed woman who needs to get laid.&quot; However, &quot;Bent&quot; was canceled after only six episodes. Peet had a recurring role as Capt. Laura Hellinger in seven episodes of the fourth season of &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2012–13). In 2013, she made her playwriting debut with &quot;The Commons of Pensacola&quot;, starring Blythe Danner and Sarah Jessica Parker, and appeared in the film &quot;Identity Thief&quot;, as the wife of a man whose identity is stolen by a woman, the little-seen comedy &quot;Trust Me&quot;, as the neighbor of a former child star, and the well received dramedy &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot;, as one half of a married couple.

From 2015 to 2016, Peet played Tina Morris on the HBO series &quot;Togetherness&quot;, which focused on the lives of two couples living under the same roof. The show—which was created, written and directed by the Duplass brothers—ran for two seasons, and was praised for its intimate storytelling and the performances of its cast. &quot;IndieWire&quot; called it &quot;the upbeat comedy HBO needs right now&quot;, and noted that while Lynskey is &quot;the true standout&quot;, Peet &quot;won&#x27;t be short of fans&quot;. From 2016 to 2020, Peet appeared in &quot;Brockmire&quot;, as the owner of a Minor League Baseball team.

===Writing and producing (2021–present)===
In 2021, Netflix released &quot;The Chair&quot;, a six-episode comedic dramatic series written by Peet and produced by her, alongside David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.

==Other endeavors==
===Activism===
In 2008, Peet volunteered to be a spokeswoman for Every Child By Two (ECBT), a non-profit organization that advocates childhood vaccination. Peet began working with the group after becoming concerned by the &quot;amount of misinformation floating around [about vaccines], particularly in Hollywood.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Cookie&quot;, Peet stated: &quot;Frankly, I feel that parents who don&#x27;t vaccinate their children are parasites,&quot; referring to the benefit unvaccinated children derive from herd immunity and the concern that dropping vaccination rates may put all children at increased risk of preventable disease. Peet&#x27;s comments stirred controversy; in response, she apologized for using the term &quot;parasites,&quot; but affirmed her position on the importance and safety of vaccinations.

The 3rd Annual Independent Investigative Group IIG Awards recognizing the promotion of science in popular media was held on May 18, 2009. The IIG presented an award to Peet for her work campaigning for vaccines.

===Writing===
Peet has co-written a children&#x27;s book &quot;Dear Santa, Love, Rachel Rosenstein&quot; about a Jewish girl during the Christmas season. The book was launched in 2015.

Peet also wrote a play &quot;Our Very Own Carlin McCullough&quot;, which ran for two months in 2018 at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles to positive reviews.

==Personal life==
Peet married screenwriter David Benioff, son of former Goldman Sachs CEO and chairman Stephen Friedman, on September 30, 2006, in New York City. They have three children. The family lives in Manhattan and Beverly Hills.

Peet is a friend of actor Peter Dinklage, who starred in her husband&#x27;s series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and whom she had met years earlier through friends at Bennington College.

In 2008, Peet revealed that she has struggled with postpartum depression.

<text>A fuel ladder or ladder fuel is a firefighting term for live or dead vegetation that allows a fire to climb up from the landscape or forest floor into the tree canopy. Common ladder fuels include tall grasses, shrubs, and tree branches, living and dead. The removal of fuel ladders is part of defensible space &#x27;firescaping&#x27; practices.

==Fire precautions==
Potential fuel ladders should be removed to reduce the risk of fire bridging the gap to the canopy. To remove the ladder requires pruning any low limbs up to a minimum of 8 feet, and potentially as high as 15 feet. The required height depends on how low the branch tips hang, the steepness of slope, and the height and spacing of other nearby vegetation.

The desired result is to create a situation in which a low-burning fire could burn to the trunk of a tree, which is protected by its bark, without having thinner, more flammable branches, leaves or needles within easy reach of the fire.

==Other fuel ladders==
Apart from tree limbs, anything that would help that fire move up into the tree canopy is a fuel ladder. This includes shrubs and even tall grass or weeds. Non-vegetation fuel sources such as woodpiles, wooden fenceposts and structures should also be considered.

The intent is to maintain a break in vertical and horizontal continuity so that, if for example a woodpile caught fire, it would not be positioned next to shrubs or directly under trees that could then easily catch fire.

<doc id="891738" wikidata="Q558309" url="?curid=891738" title="Manuel Amador Guerrero">
<text>Manuel Amador Guerrero (30 June 1833 – 2 May 1909), was the first president of Panama from 20 February 1904 to 1 October 1908. He was a member of the Conservative Party.

==Early life==
Manuel Amador Guerrero was born on 30 June 1833 in Turbaco, in the Bolívar Department of the Republic of Colombia to María Mercedes Guerrero Córdoba and José María Amador Leguina. Very little is known about his childhood and teenage years, but he studied to be a surgeon and graduated from the Universidad de Magdalena e Istmo in 1854.

==Career==
Amador came to Panama in 1855 settling in Colón and started working on the Panama Railroad as a doctor. After a year, he also took a job as the postmaster. After moving to Santiago de Veraguas, Amador began a export business &quot;Amador Hermanos&quot;, with his brother, Juan De Dios Amador Guerrero, and continued his work as a doctor and in governmental posts. He acted to the District Administration, working on the Municipal Council, and serving as a deputy to the House of Representatives for the Veraguas State in the Republic of New Granada in Bogotá from 1858 to 1859. During the same period, he began serving in the State Legislature of Veraguas.

In 1866, Amador was appointed as the first successor for the Conservative Party, in the elections for the President of the Sovereign State of Panama. When the President Vicente Olarte Galindo died in office in 1868, Amador was to succeed his term as acting president but because he was running in the election, he chose to allow the second successor Juan José Díaz to take the post as acting president. When it became evident that Amador&#x27;s victory was assured for the presidency, General Fernando Ponce staged a rebellion and drove the Conservative supporters out of the capital and back to Veraguas. In the brief battles that occurred, Amador was captured and sent into exile Cartagena.

In 1869, Amador returned to Panama, probably settling again in Santiago de Veraguas, where his son was born to María de Jesús Terreros. He soon moved to Panama City and began working at the Hospital Santo Tomás. The hospital, a charity hospital built in colonial times, suffered from lack of management and funds, and Amador took on the task of managing and reorganizing it without pay for almost two decades of the twenty-nine years in which he worked there. He also opened and ran a pharmacy near the hospital on Avenue B. It is probable his first wife died, as on 6 February 1872, Amador married Manuela María Maximiliano de la Ossa Escobar. With de la Ossa, Amador had two children, Raúl Arturo, who as an adult was attached to the Panamanian consulate in New York City and Elmira María, who married William Ehrman, one of the owners of the Ehrman Banking Company.

==Return to politics==
&quot;Amador Hermanos&quot; brought in brother, José Amador, and began working with the French company building the Panama Canal in 1879. Simultaneously, Manuel continued his work as a doctor for the Panama Canal Railway and Hospital Santo Tomás. In 1886, during the period when Colombia was reorganizing its sovereign states under a federal government, Amador served as the last President of the Sovereign State of Panamá, taking over the post vacated by on 5 June 1886 and serving until 5 August 1886. During this time frame, Amador served as chairman of the Council of the District of Panama, which had to vote on approval of the Colombian Constitution of 1886. At the end of 1888, the French company which was digging the canal went bankrupt, causing the failure of the Amador brothers&#x27; business. José Amador died soon after the business closed, but Manuel covered the company&#x27;s losses.

Amador favored continuing the canal project and when Lucien Bonaparte-Wyse made the journey to Bogotá in 1890 to gain a concession for a ten-year extension, he was accompanied by Amador. Instability plagued the French project and then in 1900, the Thousand Days&#x27; War erupted between Colombian political factions. The government in Bogotá asked the United States to protect the railway in Panama, causing the US Marines to intervene on the isthmus. In exchange for keeping the vital transit open, President José Manuel Marroquín pledged that he would insure that the United States would receive authorization to complete the canal upon restoration of peace. Amador wrote to President Marroquín, who was a personal friend, urging the approval of the Hay–Herrán Treaty. Rather than appointing a favorable candidate, Marroquín appointed an opponent to the ratification, Juan Bautista Pérez y Soto as Panama&#x27;s congressman during the negotiations.

==Independence movement==
The appointment caused José Agustín Arango to recruit his sons, Belisario, José Agustín and Ricardo Manuel; his son-in-laws Ernesto Tisdel Lefevre, Samuel Lewis, and Raoul Orillac; and a friend, Carlos Constantino Arosemena to begin working on a plan for the independence of Panama. The group was soon joined by Amador, who would become the leader of the independence movement, as well as by Ricardo and Tomás Arias, Federico Boyd, Manuel Espinosa Batista, and . Contentious negotiations with Colombia led the United States toward backing the independence movement in Panama, believing that negotiations would be more favorable to American interests from a small, weak, newly developing state, rather than continuing to work with Colombia. Amador traveled to New York in September 1903 to determine how the United States might support the separation movement. After gaining approval for support from the &quot;USS Nashville&quot;, Amador returned to Panama to get a plan in motion.

The &quot;USS Nashville&quot; landed on 2 November 1903 off the coast of Colón. The following day, 500 sharpshooters, under the command of General Juan B. Tobar traveling aboard the cruiser &quot;Cartagena&quot; and merchant ship &quot;Alexander Bixio&quot;, made landfall. Fearing that if they were caught they would be executed, Amador, Arango, Boyd, and Espinosa met to discuss the situation, because with the landed troops many of their colleagues were abandoning the cause. Amador returned home dejected, fearing all was lost, but his wife María de la Ossa came up with a plan to separate the Colombian generals from their troops with help from friends on the railway. She surmised that once the officers were separated and arrested, the troops could be bribed to return home. Amador went out to convince Herbert G. Prescott, assistant superintendent, and James Shaler, superintendent of the Panama Railway to help transport the generals and once he gained their approval, he called the separatists together to get them to endorse the plan. Shaler convinced the generals to go ahead to Panama City without their troops, while the railway was gathering sufficient cars for the troops.

When the plan successfully concluded, Panama&#x27;s independence was proclaimed and the Municipal Council met and confirmed the establishment of the Republic of Panama. Amador and Boyd were sent to Washington, D. C. to negotiate a treaty to complete the canal. When they arrived, they learned that Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla had already signed a treaty and as they were not empowered to accept it, the agreement was sent to Panama for ratification by the provisional government.

==Presidency==
On 20 February 1904, the constitutional convention unanimously elected Amador as the first president of the Republic of Panama. Because the Constitution of Panama required that the president be native-born, a clause allowing Amador to serve based on his service to the independence movement was inserted. During his presidency, he established the &quot;gold Balboa&quot; as the official currency at par with the U. S. gold dollar. His administration adopted the flag, designed by his son Manuel and sewn by his wife and her sister-in-law, Angélica Bergamonta de la Ossa, and the national anthem, that features lyrics written by his wife&#x27;s brother Jerónimo de la Ossa; created the national theater and national museum; disbanded the army, in favor of a police force; and expanded the educational system in the country.

One of the immediate actions of his administration was to resolve a difference in interpretation over the law which created the canal zone, passed on 28 April 1904. Panamanian legislators intended the granting of the zone to the United States to mean that the U.S. could exercise sovereignty &quot;only for the purpose of building the canal&quot;. As the ports were vital for Panama&#x27;s economy, the government of Panama had no intention of surrendering complete legal or economic sovereignty in the canal zone and did not cede its territory to the U.S. The Americans had established ports, customs houses and postal facilities in the zone, which were objected to by the Panamanians, as they had nothing to do with construction and were functions of a sovereign power. 
U.S. Minister to Panama Charles Edward Magoon, who was concurrently the Governor of the Canal Zone, worked with Amador to draft a working agreement to resolve the issue. Secretary of War William Howard Taft agreed with the main draft and went to Panama to meet with Amador, arriving on 27 November 1904. The three men devised an agreement to exempt only duty-free goods entering the canal zone ports of Ancon and Cristobal that were related to construction of the canal. Other goods were to be taxed by Panamanian authorities at a reduced rate of ten percent ad valorem. In exchange for infrastructure development with hospitals and roads, Amador was pleased to agree to allow the Canal Company to control sanitation and quarantine provisions in the zone and utilize municipal buildings. They also designated an agreement for currency sharing and postal regulations, among other revisions. The Taft Memorandum would affect U.S.-Panamanian relations for nearly 100 years.

==Death and legacy==
Amador decided not to run for reelection in 1908 and instead retired from public life. He died on May 2, 1909, in Panama City. His last coherent words were to express his wish that the National Anthem be played as his body was lowered into his grave, a wish that was realized.

== Trivia ==
* Plaza Amador, a popular football team in Panama&#x27;s highest league, LPF, was named in his honour. Founded back in 1955 the club&#x27;s colours are also red, blue and white as they were the colours adopted by his patriotic movement for independence.
*The Order of Manuel Amador Guerrero, the highest honour of Panama, is named in his honour.
* Fort Amador, an American military base at the Pacific (southern) end of the Panama Canal, is named in his honor.

<text>Kohala () is the name of the northwest peninsula of the island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Archipelago. In ancient Hawaii it was often ruled by an independent High Chief called the &quot;Alii Nui&quot;. In modern times it is divided into two districts of Hawaii County: North Kohala and South Kohala. Locals commonly use the name Kohala to refer to the census-designated places of Halaula, Hāwī, and Kapaau collectively. The dry western shore is commonly known as the Kohala Coast, which has golf courses and seaside resorts.

==Description==


The area was named after the dominating geological feature Kohala Mountain, the oldest of Hawaii Island&#x27;s five major volcanic mountains. The current districts cover the north and western sides of the mountain, .
It was one of the five ancient divisions of the island called &quot;moku&quot;.

The natural habitats in Kohala range across a wide rainfall gradient in a very short distance - from less than a year on the coast near Kawaihae to more than year near the summit of Kohala Mountain, a distance of just . Near the coast are remnants of dry forests, and near the summit is a cloud forest, a type of rainforest that obtains some of its moisture from &quot;cloud drip&quot; in addition to precipitation.

This precipitation allowed the northeast coast to be developed into sugarcane plantations, including one founded by Rev. Elias Bond used to fund his church and girls&#x27; seminary.

==History==

===Kohala Historical Sites State Monument===
The Kohala Historical Sites State Monument includes &quot;Mookini Heiau&quot;, a National Historic Landmark. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the unified Hawaiian Islands, was born in North Kohala west of Hāwī, at the ancient site called the &quot;Mookini Heiau&quot;. The &quot;heiau&quot; is a living spiritual temple, and not just an historic artifact of the Hawaiian culture.

The original Kamehameha Statue stands in front of the community center in Kapaau, and duplicates are found at Aliiolani Hale in Honolulu, and within the U.S. Capitol building&#x27;s statue gallery in Washington, D.C.

===Bond Historic District===
The Bond Historic District is located in the North Kohala District, with structures from the Bond family&#x27;s 19th century missionary and homesteading period on the Kohala peninsula. The Bond District has three sections: 
*Bond Homestead — the Bond House was built in the 1840s by the missionaries and later Kohala landowners Ellen and Reverend Elias Bond, and expanded by descendants through c. 1900.
*Kalahikiola Church
*Kohala Seminary

==Attractions==
Points of interest within Kohala include Hapuna Beach State Recreation Area, Puukoholā Heiau National Historic Site, and Lapakahi State Historical Park.

<text>Gov&#x27;t Mule (pronounced &quot;Government Mule&quot;) is an American Southern rock jam band, formed in 1994 as a side project of the Allman Brothers Band by guitarist Warren Haynes and bassist Allen Woody. Fans often refer to Gov&#x27;t Mule simply as &quot;Mule&quot;.

The band released their debut album, &quot;Gov&#x27;t Mule&quot;, in 1995, and have since released an additional nine studio albums, plus numerous EPs and live releases. Gov&#x27;t Mule has become a staple act at music festivals across North America, with both its members and frequent guests from other notable bands adding various funk and blues rock elements to the band&#x27;s sound.

==History==
===Formation===
When the Allman Brothers Band reformed in 1989, partially in response to the popularity of their &quot;Dreams&quot; box set, Warren Haynes was added as a permanent lead guitarist and vocalist, and Allen Woody was recruited as bass guitarist. The two shared a love for 1960s power trios like Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the James Gang, and Mountain. Haynes, Woody, and drummer Matt Abts, who played with Haynes in Dickey Betts&#x27; band, came together as Gov&#x27;t Mule during Allman Brothers breaks. They released their debut album, &quot;Gov&#x27;t Mule&quot;, produced by Michael Barbiero, in 1995. &quot;Live at Roseland Ballroom&quot; was released in 1996, consisting of their 1995 New Year&#x27;s Eve set opening for Blues Traveler.

When the Allman Brothers Band were not forthcoming with any new material, Haynes and Woody left to concentrate full-time on Gov&#x27;t Mule in 1997. Their second studio effort, &quot;Dose&quot;, also produced by Barbiero, was released in early 1998. They were joined by members of the Allman Brothers, the Black Crowes, Parliament/Funkadelic and the Derek Trucks Band for their 1998 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, released both in a two and four CD version as &quot;Live... With a Little Help from Our Friends&quot;. The performances exposed some of the bands&#x27; influences, covering Neil Young, Free, Traffic, Jimi Hendrix, Little Feat, Humble Pie and Black Sabbath.

===Death of Allen Woody===

In February 2000, the band released &quot;Life Before Insanity&quot;, to critical praise, and although the band had already experienced previous successes, they anticipated a greater commercial success with this album. Unfortunately, Allen Woody was found dead in New York City on August 26 of that year. On September 21, 2000, a benefit concert was organized called &quot;One for Woody&quot;, with the proceeds going to Woody&#x27;s daughter, Savannah Woody, intended for her education. The Allman Brothers, the Black Crowes, Phil Lesh and Friends, Jimmy Herring, Edwin McCain and several more of Woody&#x27;s friends also performed at the concert. Haynes and Abts continued to do limited touring in the Fall of 2000 supporting Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals as an homage to Woody. Their subsequent &quot;Smile at Half Mast Tour&quot; that followed was named in reference to a poem Haynes wrote for Woody&#x27;s funeral.

At the &quot;One for Woody&quot; performance and subsequently at other shows, Haynes began appearing with the Allman Brothers Band again. With Dickey Betts&#x27; departure from the Allmans, Haynes came back full-time to the band at the beginning of 2001 and has continued splitting his time between the Allman Brothers, Gov&#x27;t Mule and for a period Phil Lesh and Friends and other re-formed Grateful Dead bands.

The next year, Barbiero, Haynes and Abts began to record a tribute album. using some of Woody&#x27;s favorite bass players. These sessions resulted in two CDs &quot;The Deep End, Volume 1&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Deep End, Volume 2&quot; (2002). A documentary of the recording sessions was also made by Phish bassist Mike Gordon called &quot;Rising Low&quot;. Bass contributions to the CDs came from Jack Bruce, formerly of Cream, John Entwistle of the Who, Mike Watt of Minutemen, Les Claypool of Primus, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Chris Squire of Yes and Stefan Lessard of Dave Matthews Band among others.

A revolving door of keyboardists and bassists were used to fulfill touring engagements in support of the Deep End recordings. Keyboardists included Chuck Leavell, Rob Barraco, Page McConnell and Danny Louis. Bassists included, among others, Dave Schools of Widespread Panic, Oteil Burbridge who already had filled Woody&#x27;s former place in the Allman Brothers, Les Claypool of Primus, Victor Wooten of the Flecktones, George Porter Jr. of the Meters, Jason Newsted (formerly of Metallica), Greg Rzab formerly of the Black Crowes and the Buddy Guy Band, and Andy Hess, also formerly of the Black Crowes. Louis and Hess were eventually named as permanent members of Gov&#x27;t Mule.

===Beginnings of the Quartet===

The first CD with Louis and Hess, &quot;Deja Voodoo&quot;, was released in September 2004. The album won the Jammy award for Best Album and was the last studio album involving Michael Barbiero as producer and engineer. Additional material from those sessions was released in 2005 as &quot;Mo&#x27; Voodoo&quot;. The new lineup&#x27;s second full release, &quot;High &amp; Mighty&quot;, was released on August 22, 2006, and it was followed in 2007 by a dub/reggae album called &quot;Mighty High&quot; – including versions of covers and original songs with special guest appearances by Michael Franti, Toots Hibbert, and Willi Williams.

Gov&#x27;t Mule continues to tour extensively and has become a staple act at many music festivals including Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Mountain Jam, Vegoose, All Good, and their annual New Orleans Jazzfest night show, where they filmed and recorded the last show of the Deepest End tours, with 17 guest musicians in a six-hour show.

Every year since 1989, Warren Haynes hosts the &quot;Annual Christmas Jam&quot; in his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina. The concert usually takes place the first weekend in December at the Asheville Civic Center, as a fundraiser for Habitat For Humanity. Many artists who play at the Christmas Jam also perform separate gigs in various Asheville clubs, usually the day before the Jam proper. The Pre-Jam, as it is called, features many of the same artists, in smaller clubs. The 19th edition of the Jam took place on December 15, 2007 with performances by Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Shelly Colvin, Jason Isbell, Jackson Browne, G. Love, Bruce Hornsby, Peter Frampton, and others. Gov&#x27;t Mule headlined.

On June 28, 2008, while keyboardist Danny Louis was drafted by Cheap Trick to revisit Sgt. Pepper at the Hollywood Bowl, Gov&#x27;t Mule performed as a power trio for the first time since 2000, this time with its regular bassist Andy Hess. The band titled their set &quot;Old School Mule&quot; and ran through some of their older songs such as &quot;Wandering Child&quot; and &quot;Thorazine Shuffle&quot;.

On September 15, 2008, Haynes&#x27; wife, Stefani Scamardo announced on her Sirius radio show that Andy Hess would be leaving the band and a new bassist would be in place for the fall tour. Hess was subsequently replaced by Jorgen Carlsson, who had been rehearsing with the band for six months.

===Enter Carlsson===

On August 17, 2009, it was announced on the band&#x27;s official website that Gov&#x27;t Mule&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;By a Thread&quot;, would be released on October 27, 2009. On the same date, the first track of the new album, &quot;Broke Down on the Brazos&quot;, featuring Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, was made available for listening on the website.

On October 31, 2009, Gov&#x27;t Mule gave a special Halloween concert at the Tower Theater outside Philadelphia. From the Gov&#x27;t Mule web site: &quot;Following in the tradition of 2007&#x27;s &quot;Holy Haunted House&quot; and last year&#x27;s Pink Floyd spectacular, the band, once again, has something very special planned for the occasion.&quot; This third in their series of Halloween shows featured a first set of over two hours, composed entirely of Rolling Stones covers. Previous sold-out shows had featured covers of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and an assortment of Pink Floyd compositions.

Gov&#x27;t Mule played at the &quot;Island Exodus&quot; in Negril, Jamaica in January 2010, at the all-inclusive resort The Grand Lido Negril. The First Island Exodus consisted of three Gov&#x27;t Mule shows and a Warren Haynes solo show. Also appearing at this event were Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Ron Holloway, and DJ Logic.

Gov&#x27;t Mule also played at the Hangout Music festival on Saturday, May 15, 2010, and at the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain, on June 24, 2010. The band also opened up for the Dave Matthews Band on Friday, July 30, 2010, at Cruzan Amphitheatre, in West Palm Beach, Florida.

In October 2010, Gov&#x27;t Mule celebrated Halloween at the Fox Theater in Oakland, California. Warren Haynes and company used their first set to cover the Who&#x27;s album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; in its entirety.

Except for its regular festival appearances, the band was mostly on hiatus during the early part of the decade while band members pursued other projects, particularly Haynes and his Warren Haynes Band. In the summer of 2013, the band gave details on their album &quot;Shout!&quot;, their first studio album in four years and their first release on Blue Note Records, which was released on September 24 of that year. In what Haynes contends is a first, the album included a bonus disc consisting of covers of the album&#x27;s tracks by artists including Elvis Costello, Dr. John, Grace Potter and Steve Winwood.

On December 31, 2013, Gov&#x27;t Mule performed with Robby Krieger, the guitarist from the Doors, at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.

The following year, they performed at the Beacon Theatre again with Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge. They performed 18 classic AC/DC songs in a second set with Kennedy on vocals for the New Year&#x27;s Eve &quot;Back at the Beacon&quot; show.

===Recent years===
On June 9, 2017, Gov&#x27;t Mule released their tenth studio album &quot;Revolution Come... Revolution Go&quot; on Fantasy Records. Following the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; premiere of &quot;Stone Cold Rage&quot;, &quot;Sarah, Surrender&quot; was premiered exclusively at KBCO, and the album launched for pre-orders on April 12. When talking about &quot;Stone Cold Rage&quot;, Haynes points out that the song represents &quot;the divide that&#x27;s going on in our country right now.&quot; He explains that &quot;even though it was written before the election, it was written knowing that whichever way the results went, we were going to have close to fifty percent of the nation very angry. Musically, it&#x27;s an aggressive up-tempo rock song that reflects the anger of the lyrics, but with a sense of sarcasm and humor.&quot;

On the heels of the release of their new record, &quot;Revolution Come... Revolution Go&quot;, Gov&#x27;t Mule kicked off their extensive tour, including stops at New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival with Soulive, New York and Philadelphia with Chris Robinson Brotherhood, a return to Europe, 14 dates with Galactic up and down the East Coast/Mid-West, a night at Red Rocks, festival sets at The Peach Music Festival, Lockn&#x27; Festival, Summer Camp Music Festival and Del Fest, and four shows with Blackberry Smoke. Appearing as festival-closing headliner for the King Biscuit Blues Festival, the band was joined in a 40-minute encore by blues musicians Larry McCray and Bob Margolin. In 2019, the Mule released a full-length concert film and accompanying recording, &quot;Bring on the Music&quot;, which was recorded at Port Chester, New York&#x27;s Capitol Theatre.

&quot;Peace... Like a River&quot; followed in 2023. Days prior to the release, Jorgen Carlsson announced he was departing the band, to be replaced on tour by Kevin Scott.

<text>David Dale Alexander (April 26, 1903 – March 2, 1979), nicknamed &quot;Moose&quot;, was an American baseball player and manager.

A native of Greeneville, Tennessee, Alexander played professional baseball, principally as a first baseman, for 20 years from 1923 to 1942, including five years in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers (1929–1932) and Boston Red Sox (1932–1933). At six feet, three inches and 210 pounds, he was one of the American League&#x27;s best hitters from 1929 to 1932. He led the American League with 215 hits as a rookie in 1929, totaled 272 RBIs in his first two major league seasons, and won the major league batting title in 1932 with a .367 batting average. In five major league seasons, he compiled a .331 batting average with 811 hits, 61 home runs and 459 RBIs.

In May 1933, Alexander sustained third degree burns on his leg and later developed gangrene after being given diathermy treatment for a twisted knee. The burns and infection limited his mobility and effectively ended his major league career. He continued to play in the minor leagues until 1942, compiling a .334 batting average with 2,145 hits and 1,171 RBIs in minor league play. He also served as a minor league manager for the Sanford Lookouts (1939), Thomasville Tourists (1940), Selma Cloverleafs (1941), Greeneville Burley Cubs (1942), Knoxville Smokies (1946–1948), and Jacksonville Tars (1950). He also served as a scout for the New York Giants and Milwaukee Braves in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Early years==
Alexander was born in Greeneville, Tennessee, in 1903. He was raised on a family farm that had been in his family since the 18th century. He attended Milligan College where he was an outstanding end and punter on the school&#x27;s football team. He also played basketball and baseball at Milligan and later played baseball for Tusculum College.

==Professional baseball==

===Minor leagues===
Alexander began playing professional baseball for his hometown team, the Greeneville Burley Cubs of the Appalachian League, in 1923 and 1924. In 1924, he compiled a .332 batting average with 28 doubles and 10 triples in 114 games. He moved on to the Charlotte Hornets of the South Atlantic League, batting .331 in 1925 and .323 in 1926.

Alexander next played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. In 1927, he compiled a .338 batting average with 26 doubles, 11 triples and 12 home runs and 97 RBIs. The next year, he won the International League triple crown with a .380 batting average, 31 home runs, and 144 runs batted in. After his 1929 season, expectations for Alexander were high, with some writers comparing him to Babe Ruth.

===Detroit Tigers===

On December 5, 1928, the Detroit Tigers purchased Alexander and pitcher Augie Prudhomme from Toronto for $100,000 cash and three players to be named later. In 1929, Alexander won the first base job with the Tigers, starting 155 games at the position. He compiled a .343 batting average, scored 110 runs, and led the American League with 215 hits. He also ranked among the American League leaders with 83 extra base hits (second), 363 total bases (second), 137 RBIs (third), 25 home runs (fifth), a .580 slugging percentage (fifth), 43 doubles (fifth), and 15 triples (fourth). After a tremendous rookie season, comparisons to Babe Ruth continued with one writer even dubbing him the &quot;Prince of Swat&quot;.

In 1930, Alexander started 154 games at first base for the Tigers and compiled a .326 batting average with 20 home runs and 135 RBIs. In his first two major league seasons, Alexander had 272 RBIs. The only player with more RBIs in his first two major league seasons was Joe DiMaggio in 1936 and 1937. Alexander also had the longest hitting streak of the 1930 season, a 29-game streak in which he had 41 hits in 121 at bats.

In 1931, Alexander appeared in 135 games, including 125 games as the Tigers&#x27; starting first baseman and four as a starter in left field. He compiled a stunning .490 batting average in the first two weeks of the season. He then had &quot;a long layoff&quot; in May and June after a spike injury became infected. His batting average dipped to .325 by the end of the season. Though his numbers were less impressive than in his first two seasons with the club, he compiled a .325 batting average, a .401 on-base percentage, and 87 RBIs.

In 1932, Alexander lost his job as the Tigers&#x27; starting first baseman as Harry &quot;Stinky&quot; Davis took over the post. During the first two months of the 1932 season, Alexander was used principally as a pinch-hitter and compiled a .250 average in 22 plate appearances in 23 games.

===Boston Red Sox===
On June 13, 1932, the Tigers traded Alexander with Roy Johnson to the Boston Red Sox, in exchange for Earl Webb, who had set a major league record with 67 doubles in 1931. Webb hit only 19 doubles for the Tigers in 1932 and retired one year later. Alexander won the American League batting crown with a .367 batting average in 1932. He beat Jimmie Foxx by a mere three points, depriving Foxx of the triple crown. Alexander was the first of only two major league batting champions to be traded to another team in the same league during the season in which he won the title, the second being Harry &quot;The Hat&quot; Walker, who won the National League batting title in 1947, after being traded from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Philadelphia Phillies, three weeks into the 1947 season. (In 1990, Willie McGee won the National League batting title despite being traded to the American League in late August). On August 6, 1932, Alexander broke up a no-hitter by Cleveland pitcher Wes Ferrell, who ended up with a one-hitter.

On May 30, 1933, Alexander twisted a knee in a game at Philadelphia. He was given diathermy treatment (&quot;electrically induced heat&quot; used for muscle relaxation) in the clubhouse by Red Sox trainer Doc Woods. Alexander&#x27;s leg suffered third degree burns during the treatment, and gangrene eventually set in. &quot;It was a new method of treatment and not too much was known about it&quot;, Alexander said, years later. &quot;I noticed my leg felt awfully hot. I ended up with third-degree burns and a gangrene infection and almost lost my leg. I was finished in the Majors... I couldn&#x27;t run and I couldn&#x27;t field and when I got hurt, that was the end.&quot;

Alexander attempted a comeback but injured his leg again in July 1933 and saw limited action for the rest of the season, mostly as a pinch hitter. Alexander wound up hitting .281 in 1933 and played his last major league game on September 23, 1933, against the New York Yankees.

===Later career===

====Minor league player====
After 1933, Alexander&#x27;s mobility and fielding suffered, but he was able to hit well enough to continue playing in the minor leagues, primarily as a first baseman, until 1942. Alexander&#x27;s return to the minor leagues began in February 1934 when the Red Sox assigned him to the Jersey City Skeeters. The following month, he signed a contract to play for the Newark Bears in the International League. During the 1934 season, he appeared in 134 games for Newark, principally as a first baseman, and hit .336 with 123 RBIs, 14 home runs, 35 doubles, and seven stolen bases.

On November 3, 1934, the Newark club sold Alexander to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association for a price that was reported to be &quot;one of the highest ever paid by an American Association club.&quot; He became the Blues&#x27; starting first baseman, appearing in 120 games in 1935. He compiled a .358 batting average in 1935 and set a new American Association record by hitting four home runs in a game against Minneapolis on June 14, 1935. In 1936, he appeared in 154 games for the Blues, including 153 at first base, and compiled a .315 batting average with 100 RBIs.

In December 1936, the Kansas City club sold Alexander to the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association. During the 1937 season, he appeared in 153 games for Nashville, 153 at first base, and compiled a .319 batting average with 109 RBIs.

On February 19, 1938, Alexander signed with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association. He appeared in 140 games for Chattanooga, 137 at first base, and compiled a .309 batting average with 85 RBIs.

====Minor league player-manager====
In February 1939, Alexander, at age 36, was hired as player-manager for the Sanford Lookouts in the Florida State League. Alexander appeared in 98 games as a player, 96 as a first baseman, and compiled a .345 batting average with 80 RBIs and 14 stolen bases. He had the highest batting average on the Sanford team and led the team to a 98–35 record and a Florida State League championship.

He then spent the 1940 season as a player-manager for the Thomasville Tourists in the Georgia-Florida League. He compiled a .388 batting average in 91 games and 330 at bats for Thomasville.

In 1941, Alexander was hired as a player-manager for the Selma Cloverleafs of the Southeastern League. He compiled a career-high .438 batting average in 56 games, principally as a pinch-hitter, for the Cloverleafs.

In 1942, he returned to the Greeneville Burley Cubs, the hometown team with which he began his career in 1923. He served as a player-manager for Greeneville during the 1942 season. In his final season as a player, Alexander compiled a .158 batting average in 19 at bats.

During his minor league playing career, Alexander never hit under .300 until 1942, his final year as a professional baseball player. His minor league batting average was .334 with 2,145 hits and 1,171 RBIs. While serving as manager of the Greeneville club, he also ran an unsuccessful campaign to be elected as the sheriff of Greene County, Tennessee.

====Tobacco farmer, manager and scout====
Alexander was not associated with professional baseball from 1943 to 1945, instead operating a tobacco farm in his hometown of Greeneville, Tennessee.

He returned to coaching with the Knoxville Smokies from 1946 to 1948. He resigned his position with the Knoxville club on June 5, 1948.

After resigning from Knoxville and continuing through the 1949 season, Alexander served as a scout for the New York Giants covering the states of Kentucky and Tennessee. He was assigned by the Giants in July 1948 to manage the Bristol Twins.

In June 1950, Alexander was hired to take over mid-season as the manager of the last-place Jacksonville Tars in the South Atlantic League.

After retiring as a manager in 1950, Alexander returned to his job as a scout for the New York Giants. He continued as a scout for the Giants for 13 years from 1951 to 1962. He has been credited with signing infielder Ernie Bowman, a native of Johnson City, Tennessee, pitcher Jim Constable, a native of Jonesborough, Tennessee, first baseman Gail Harris, a native of Abingdon, Virginia, and pitcher Joe Shipley, a native of Morristown, Tennessee. He has also been credited with spotting Willie McCovey who grew up in Mobile, Alabama, and began playing in the Georgia State League. In November 1962, he was hired as a scout for the Milwaukee Braves with responsibility for Tennessee, northern Alabama, and southwestern Virginia.

==Family and later years==
In the winter between the 1931 and 1932 seasons, Alexander married Verna Hutton from his hometown of Greeneville, Tennessee. He had two sons, Don and Steve, both of whom played baseball. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1970, and died in 1979 at Greeneville, Tennessee, at age 75.

<text>Jay DeFeo (31 March 1929 – 11 November 1989) was an American visual artist who became celebrated in the 1950s as part of the spirited community of Beat artists, musicians, and poets in San Francisco. Best known for her monumental work &quot;The Rose&quot;, DeFeo produced courageously experimental works throughout her career, exhibiting what art critic Kenneth Baker called “fearlessness.”

==Life and work==
=== Early life ===
Jay DeFeo was born Mary Joan DeFeo on 31 March 1929, in Hanover, New Hampshire, to a nurse from an Austrian immigrant family and an Italian-American medical student.

In 1932, the DeFeo family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where her father graduated from Stanford University School of Medicine and became a traveling doctor for the Civilian Conservation Corps. Between 1935 and 1938, DeFeo traveled around rural parts of Northern California with her parents, and also spent extensive time with her maternal grandparents on a farm in Colorado as well as with her paternal grandparents in the more urban Oakland, California. When her parents divorced in 1939, DeFeo joined her mother in San Jose, California, where DeFeo attended Alum Rock Union School and excelled in art.

In high school DeFeo acquired the nickname “Jay,” which she used as her common name for the rest of her life. An important early mentor was her high school art teacher, Lena Emery, who took her to museums to see works by Picasso and Matisse, opening up a new world to the young artist. DeFeo enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley, in 1946, studying with many well-known art professors, including Margaret Peterson O’Hagan. Fellow students included Pat Adams, Walter Askin, Sam Francis, and Fred Martin.

In her artwork, she resisted what she called &quot;the hierarchy of material&quot;, using plaster and mixing media to experiment with effects, a thread one can see running through the art of that time, especially on the West Coast.

===Beginning art career===
After receiving a BA and MA from UC Berkeley, DeFeo won the Sigmund Martin Heller Award which allowed her to travel to Europe in October of 1951. She lived in Paris and London, and then spent three months traveling through Europe, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and North Africa. Throughout her time in Europe she studied primitive painting and Renaissance art. By the summer of 1952 she settled in Florence where she would begin an intense period of painting. 

In 1953 DeFeo returned to Berkeley, where she created large plaster sculptures, works on paper, and small wire jewelry. She met the artist Wally Hedrick and they married in 1954. At first they lived on Bay Street in San Francisco, close to the California School of Fine Arts, where DeFeo worked as an artist’s model. DeFeo focused on making jewelry to support herself, as well as creating small paintings and drawings. It was during this time that DeFeo had her first one-person exhibition at The Place, a San Francisco tavern and poets’ hangout. DeFeo also exhibited her jewelry at Dover Galleries in Berkeley, and was included in many group exhibitions over the next few years.

Early in 1955, DeFeo was featured— along with Julius Wasserstein, Roy De Forest, Sonia Gechtoff, Hassel Smith, Paul Sarkisian, Craig Kauffman, and Gilbert Henderson—in a group exhibition, &quot;Action&quot;, independently curated by Walter Hopps in Santa Monica, where the featured paintings were installed around the base of a working merry-go-round. Later that year, DeFeo and Hedrick moved to 2322 Fillmore Street, into a spacious second-floor flat, where DeFeo was able to work on a larger scale. The Fillmore Street building—whose inhabitants at various times included the visual artists Sonia Gechtoff, Jim Kelly, Joan Brown, Craig Kauffman, John Duff, and Ed Moses; the poets Joanna and Michael McClure; and the musician Dave Getz—became a hangout for other artists, writers, and jazz musicians. The artist Billy Al Bengston remembers DeFeo as having “style, moxie, natural beauty and more ‘balls’ than anyone.”

Hedrick, Deborah Remington, Hayward Ellis King, David Simpson, John Allen Ryan, and Jack Spicer founded The 6 Gallery at 3119 Fillmore Street, at the location of the King Ubu Gallery, which had been run by Jess [Collins] and Robert Duncan. Joan Brown, Manuel Neri, and Bruce Conner would become associates of The 6 Gallery. DeFeo was present when Allen Ginsberg first read his poem Howl at the famous The 6 Gallery reading in 1955. In 1959, DeFeo became an original member of Bruce Conner’s Rat Bastard Protective Association.

In 1959, DeFeo was included in Dorothy Canning Miller’s seminal exhibition &quot;Sixteen Americans&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, alongside Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Louise Nevelson, among others. Following this she had a solo exhibition in Los Angeles at the Ferus Gallery, started by Walter Hopps and Ed Kienholz.

===&quot;The Rose&quot;===

DeFeo’s best-known painting, &quot;The Rose&quot; (1958–1966) preoccupied her for almost eight years. Selected by Thomas Hoving for his book &quot;Greatest Works of Art of Western Civilization&quot;, this masterwork stands over 3.2 meters tall and weighs over a ton. As she worked on it, DeFeo built up and then carved away at the paint, in an almost sculptural process. In the end a starburst motif emerged with ridges of white paint radiating out to rougher textured gray material sparkling with mica.

The greater part of DeFeo’s work on &quot;The Rose&quot; terminated when she was evicted from her Fillmore Street apartment in November 1965. Her friend Bruce Conner stated that an “uncontrolled event” was necessary to force her to finish this work, and he documented its removal from her apartment in a short film titled &quot;The White Rose&quot; (1967). As the film shows, the painting was so large that the wall below a window opening was cut out to allow the painting&#x27;s removal. Conner captured DeFeo dangling her feet from a fire escape as she watched the work being removed by forklift and carried off in a moving van. The painting was taken to the Pasadena Art Museum (now called Norton Simon Museum), where DeFeo added finishing details in 1966, before taking a four-year break from creating art. In 1969, the work was finally shown in solo exhibitions at the Pasadena Art Museum and the San Francisco Museum of Art (now SFMOMA), with an accompanying essay by Fred Martin. Martin then arranged for the painting to be installed on the wall of a conference room at the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1973, concerned that &quot;The Rose&quot; was not well protected, DeFeo arranged for a conservator to begin stabilizing the painting, a project which could not be completed fully because of a lack of funds. Afterwards, a wall was built in front of the painting to help keep it safe. It remained hidden there until 1995, when the Whitney Museum of American Art conserved and acquired the work for its collection.

===Artistic style and later career===
During her four decades of making art, DeFeo worked in a variety of media, creating drawings, paintings, sculpture, jewelry, photographs, photocopies, collages, and photo collages. Using an experimental approach to each medium, DeFeo developed her own “visual vocabulary,” playing with scale, color vs. black/white, texture or the illusion of texture, and precision vs. ambiguity. She wrote, “I do believe that more so than most artists, I maintain a kind of consciousness of everything I’ve ever done while I’m engaged on a current work.” DeFeo often made her artwork in series, exploring, for example, light and dark versions, as well as mirror opposites. At times her artwork took off from a small quotidian object, such as a dental bridge or swimming goggles, transforming the everyday into something with “universal character.”

During the 1970s, DeFeo took a particular interest in photography. In 1970, a friend loaned her a Mamiya camera, and with the help of photography students in her art classes, she learned how to develop film and make prints. When DeFeo won a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1973, she bought a Hasselblad camera and built a darkroom in her home, continuing to explore photography and photo collage for several years. &quot;Untitled&quot; (1973) is an example of a DeFeo photo collage in which she combines images of recognizable objects in surprising juxtapositions. In the late 1970s, DeFeo’s photography focused more on her work in progress in the studio, which evolved into a “visual diary” made of hundreds of contact sheets.

During the 1980s DeFeo returned to oil paint, after working primarily in acrylic for a decade. In the summer of 1984, she traveled to Japan with her friend and fellow Mills College professor Mary-Ann Milford. This trip, along with an exhibit of Japanese helmets, inspired her 1987 &quot;Samurai&quot; drawing series. In the summer of 1987, DeFeo traveled to Africa, inspiring her to produce a series of abstract drawings called &quot;Reflections of Africa&quot;, using a generic tissue box as her concrete starting-off point. In Africa, DeFeo climbed to the summit of Mount Kenya (more than 17,000 feet), realizing a long-held dream of climbing a major mountain.

For years DeFeo taught art part-time at various Bay Area institutions, including the San Francisco Art Institute (1964–1971), the San Francisco Museum of Art (1972–1977), Sonoma State University (1976–1979), the California College of Arts and Crafts (1978–1981), and UC Berkeley (1980). She received her first full-time position at Mills College (1980–1989), where she eventually became the Lucie Stern Trustee Professor of Art.

===Personal life===
The 1965 eviction from Fillmore Street precipitated a breakup between Hedrick and DeFeo, culminating in divorce (1969). In 1967, she began a thirteen-year relationship with John Bogdanoff, a younger man, and they eventually settled in Larkspur in Marin County. Separated from Bogdanoff and teaching at Mills College, she moved to Oakland in 1981 and built out a large live/work studio where she continued to expand on her ideas through painting, drawing, photocopy, and collage. Her life was filled with many good friends, inspiring students, and friendly dogs. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1988 but continued to work prolifically. She died on 11 November 1989, at the age of 60.

==Exhibitions and collections==
The Whitney Museum of American Art, which holds the largest public collection of DeFeo’s work, presented a major retrospective from 28 February to 2 June 2013—also shown at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

<doc id="891766" wikidata="Q313240" url="?curid=891766" title="Modibo Keïta">
<text>Modibo Keïta (4 June 1915 – 16 May 1977) was a Malian politician who served as the first President of Mali from 1960 to 1968. He espoused a form of African socialism. He was deposed in a coup d&#x27;état in 1968 by Moussa Traoré.

Born and raised in Bamako, Keïta began a career as a teacher in 1936 under French colonial rule before entering politics during the 1940s. In 1945, he co-founded the Sudanese Union (US) with Mamadou Konaté which became part of the African Democratic Rally (RDA) the following year to form the US-RDA. Being elected to several positions, his political prominence grew in the 1950s, and in 1959, he became Prime Minister of the Mali Federation, a short-lived federation of Mali and Senegal. Following the federation&#x27;s collapse in 1960, Mali became an independent state, and Keïta became the new country&#x27;s inaugural president.

As President, Keïta soon established the US-RDA as the only official party, and began implementing socialist policies based on extensive nationalization. In foreign affairs, Keïta supported the Non-Aligned Movement and maintained strong relations with the West despite his socialist leanings. A leading Pan-Africanist, he played important roles in the drafting of the charter of the Organization of African Unity and the negotiation the 1963 Bamako Accords, which ended the Sand War between Morocco and Algeria.

During the late 1960s, dissatisfaction with his regime grew due to progressive economic decline and his repressive responses to dissent. He was overthrown in the 1968 Malian coup d&#x27;état by Moussa Traoré, who succeeded him as president and sent him to prison, where he died in 1977.

==Youth==

Keïta was born in Bamako-Coura, a neighborhood of Bamako, which was at the time the capital of French Sudan. His family were Malian Muslims who claimed direct descent from the Keita dynasty, the founders of the medieval Mali Empire. His nickname after primary schooling was Modo. He was educated in Bamako and at the école normale William-Ponty in Dakar, where he was top of his class. Beginning in 1936, he worked as a teacher in Bamako, Sikasso and Tombouctou. He married Mariam Travélé, who was also a teacher, in September 1939.

==Entering politics==

Modibo Keïta was involved in various associations. In 1937, he was the coordinator of the art and theater group. Along with Ouezzin Coulibaly, he helped found the Union of French West African Teachers.

Keïta joined the Communist Study Groups (GEC) cell in Bamako.

In 1943, he founded the &quot;L&#x27;oeil de Kénédougou&quot;, a magazine critical of colonial rule. This led to his imprisonment for three weeks in 1946 at the &quot;Prison de la Santé&quot; in Paris.

In 1945 Keïta was a candidate for the Constituent Assembly of the French Fourth Republic, supported by GEC and the Sudanese Democratic Party. Later the same year, he and Mamadou Konaté founded the &quot;Bloc soudanais&quot;, which developed into the Sudanese Union.

==Political life==

In October 1946, the African Democratic Rally (RDA) was created at a conference in Bamako of delegates from across French Africa. While the coalition was led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Keïta assumed the post of RDA Secretary-General in French Sudan, and head of the Soudanese affiliate: the US-RDA. In 1948, he was elected general councilor of French Sudan. In 1956, he was elected mayor of Bamako and became a member of the National Assembly of France. He twice served as secretary of state in the governments of Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury and Félix Gaillard. Modibo Keïta became the premier of Mali Federation in 1959. He was elected constituent assembly president of the Mali Federation on 20 July 1960, which consisted of French Sudan and Senegal. Senegal would later leave the federation.he was exceptional president .

==President of Mali==


After the collapse of the Mali Federation, the US-RDA proclaimed the Sudanese Republic&#x27;s complete independence as the Republic of Mali. Keïta became its first president, and soon afterward declared the US-RDA to be the only legal party.

President Keïta, whose Sudanese Union-African Democratic Rally (US-RDA) party had dominated pre-independence politics (as a member of the African Democratic Rally), moved quickly to declare a single-party state and to pursue a socialist policy based on extensive nationalization. As president, he tasked the ruling political party, the Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally, with pursuing a policy of consolidating state power in order to modernize the country. The party&#x27;s ideology was typical of African countries that had gained independence - a synthesis of leftist ideas, including Marxism, an emphasis on national traditions, and Islamism. Keïta withdrew from the French Community and also had close ties to the Eastern bloc. A continuously deteriorating economy led to a decision to rejoin the Franc Zone in 1967 and modify some of the economic excesses.

As a socialist, he led his country towards the progressive socialization of the economy; at first starting with agriculture and trade, then in October 1960 creating the SOMIEX (Malian Import and Export Company), which had a monopoly over the exports of the products of Mali, as well as manufactured and food imports (e.g. sugar, tea, powdered milk) and their distribution inside the country. The establishment of the Malian franc in 1962, and the difficulties of provisioning, resulted in a severe inflation and dissatisfaction of the population, particularly the peasants and the businessmen. The authorities were also trying to introduce tough anti-slavery policies, which persisted in some parts of the country despite the official ban.

In June 1961, he paid a state visit to the United Kingdom, where Queen Elizabeth II invested him as an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. Although Keïta was initially viewed with some wariness by the United States because of his socialist views, he made it clear that he sought good relations with Washington. In September 1961, he travelled to America in the company of President Sukarno and met with President John F. Kennedy. Keïta, afterward, felt that he had a friend in Kennedy. He travelled to the United States after the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, FPR Yugoslavia where the conference delegated him with expressing their common positions to the American administration.

He also resolved the Conflict between Morocco and Algeria and would also try to form a union between Ghana, and Guinea and worked tirelessly to improve relations with the countries of Senegal. He would also win the Lenin Peace Prize for his attempts on rebuilding the economy of Mali with socialism. However Mali was dealing with financial and economic problems, made worse by an especially poor harvest in 1968 which would later lead to a coup.

On the political level, Modibo Keïta quickly imprisoned opponents like Fily Dabo Sissoko. The first post-independence elections, in 1964, saw a single list of 80 US-RDA candidates returned to the National Assembly, and Keïta was duly reelected to another term as president by the legislature. From 22 August 1967, he started the &quot;revolution active&quot; and suspended the constitution by creating the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (Comité national de défense de la révolution, CNDR). The exactions of the &quot;milice populaire&quot; (the US-RDA militia) and the devaluation of the Malian franc in 1967 brought general unrest.

On 19 November 1968, General Moussa Traoré overthrew Modibo Keïta in a coup d&#x27;état, and sent him to prison in the northern Malian town of Kidal.

After being transferred back to the capital Bamako in February 1977 in what was claimed to be an action by the government towards national reconciliation in preparation for his release, Modibo Keïta died, still a prisoner, on May 16, 1977. His reputation was rehabilitated in 1992 following the overthrow of Moussa Traoré and subsequent elections of president Alpha Oumar Konaré. A monument to Modibo Keïta was dedicated in Bamako on June 6, 1999.

==As a Pan-Africanist==

Modibo Keïta devoted his entire life to African unity. He first played a part in the creation of the Federation of Mali with Léopold Sédar Senghor. After its collapse, he moved away from Léopold Sédar Senghor, but with Sékou Touré, the president of Guinea, and Kwame Nkrumah, the President of Ghana, he formed the Union of the States of Western Africa. In 1963, he played an important role in drafting the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).

In 1963, he invited the king of Morocco and the president of Algeria to Bamako, in the hope of ending the Sand War, a frontier conflict between the two nations. Along with Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, Keïta was successful in negotiating the Bamako Accords, which brought an end to the conflict. As a result, he won the Lenin Peace Prize that year.

From 1963 to 1966, he normalized relations with the countries of Senegal, Upper Volta and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. An advocate of the Non-Aligned Movement, Modibo defended the nationalist movements like the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN).

==In literature==

Malian author Massa Makan Diabaté satirizes Keïta&#x27;s presidency in his 1979 novel &quot;Le boucher de Kouta&quot; (&quot;The Butcher of Kouta&quot;), which features a socialist, dictatorial president named &quot;Bagabaga Daba&quot; (literally, &quot;ant with a big mouth&quot;), who is later removed by a military coup.

<text>The Little Obed River is a ten mile long stream in the Cumberland Plateau in Cumberland County, Tennessee.

The Little Obed rises east of Crossville and from near its source flows in a deep gorge that it has cut into the rocks capping the plateau, primarily sandstones of the Pennsylvanian Period. The depth of the gorge seems disproportionate to the size of the stream, as is typical of many of the streams of the plateau. The erosive power of plateau streams is considerable because of the frequent and often intense rainfall in the area. The Little Obed and its gorge are bridged by U.S. Highway 127 just north of Crossville; the Little Obed&#x27;s confluence with the Obed River is slightly northwest of Crossville near the remains of a former bridge on an abandoned railroad that once linked Nashville and Knoxville.

<text>Michael Dennis Malloy (born July 1, 1942) is a progressive American radio broadcaster based in Atlanta. Previously his show has been carried by WSB (AM) Atlanta, WLS (AM) Chicago, the I.E. America Radio Network, the Air America Radio network, Nova M Radio and the On Second Thought network. He is now self-syndicated. Politically, he describes himself as &quot;a traditional Liberal Democrat doing his part to return the Democratic Party to its Liberal roots.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Malloy was born in Toledo, Ohio. His mother was a waitress, and his father was a construction cost analyst. He studied English and political science at North Carolina State University, the University of Toledo, Georgia State University, and Jacksonville University. In the late 1970s, Malloy relocated to Atlanta and became editor of the alternative weekly newspaper &quot;Creative Loafing&quot; and actor with the Southern Theater Conspiracy. From 1984 to 1987, he was a news writer with CNN, and he was a writer and producer for CNN International in 2000.

==Radio career==
Malloy began his radio career in 1985 as an apprentice with Ludlow Porch of WCNN in Atlanta (not related to CNN). Malloy hosted an afternoon (12 p.m. to 2 p.m.) show on WSB in Atlanta from 1986 to 1988 and 1992 to March 24, 1995, until WSB replaced him with the syndicated program of Laura Schlessinger. Malloy&#x27;s WSB program competed against conservative talk show &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; on rival station WGST. On July 5, 1995, Malloy began a new show in the 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. daypart on WQXI as brokered programming. On October 2, 1996, Malloy began hosting a late-night show on WRFG, a non-commercial FM station in Atlanta known as Radio Free Georgia. During his career in Atlanta, Malloy contributed opinion articles and editorials to the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;.

In 1997, Malloy began to host a show that aired from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. on the Chicago station WLS. Malloy&#x27;s WLS program was regularly among the top 25 late-night programs in Chicago. In 1999 and 2000, &quot;Talkers&quot; magazine ranked Malloy in its Heavy Hundred listing, and Malloy won an Achievement in Radio award for best overnight radio show in Chicago. Malloy&#x27;s last WLS show was on March 24, 2000. WLS claims that he voluntarily left with mutual consent, but &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Eric Zorn claimed that an executive at the station called Malloy &quot;mean-spirited&quot; in an e-mail.

His program was syndicated between October 2000 and February 2004 on I.E. America Radio Network. &quot;The Mike Malloy Show&quot; was aired during the 9PM-12AM (ET) timeslot from 2004 until August 2006 on Air America Radio. His time at I.E. America didn&#x27;t last long. From August to October 2006, Malloy could be heard on the Head On Radio Network. The network rebroadcast Malloy programs from his i.e. America and Air America Radio programs nightly at 10:00 PM. The show was heard on Nova M Radio beginning on October 30, 2006. The show was then briefly heard on the On Second Thought network.

Mike Malloy is now self-syndicating his radio program. He is currently being heard in 13 markets across America. Direct listener support is enabled through the sale of podcast subscriptions via his website.

==Controversy==
On May 4, 2011, Malloy made remarks regarding the killing of Osama bin Laden, stating:All the death in Iraq was not caused by bin Laden. The death in Iraq was caused by George W. Bush. Five thousand Americans, tens of thousands permanently damaged and shot to pieces, a million Iraqis dead – that wasn&#x27;t bin Laden. That was George Bush. So when does Seal Unit 6, or whatever it&#x27;s called, drop in on George Bush? Bush was responsible for a lot more death, innocent death, than bin Laden.The comment drew critical national attention.

<doc id="891796" wikidata="Q783056" url="?curid=891796" title="Australian plate">
<text>The Australian plate is a major tectonic plate in the eastern and, largely, southern hemispheres. Originally a part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, Australia remained connected to India and Antarctica until approximately when India broke away and began moving north. Australia and Antarctica had begun rifting by and completely separated a while after this, some believing as recently as , but most accepting presently that this had occurred by .

The Australian plate later fused with the adjacent Indian plate beneath the Indian Ocean to form a single Indo-Australian plate. However, recent studies suggest that the two plates have once again split apart and have been separate plates for at least 3 million years and likely longer. The Australian plate includes the continent of Australia, including Tasmania, as well as portions of New Guinea, New Zealand and the Indian Ocean basin.

== Scope ==
The continental crust of this plate covers the whole of Australia, the Gulf of Carpentaria, southern New Guinea, the Arafura Sea, the Coral Sea. The continental crust also includes northwestern New Zealand, New Caledonia and Fiji. The oceanic crust includes the southeast Indian Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Timor Sea. The Australian plate is bordered (clockwise) by the Eurasian plate, the Philippine plate, the Pacific plate, the Antarctic plate, the African plate and the Indian plate. It is however known from movement studies that this definition of the Australian plate is 20% less accurate than one that assumes independently moving Capricorn, and Macquarie microplates.

== Geography ==
The northeasterly side is a complex but generally convergent boundary with the Pacific plate. The Pacific plate is subducting under the Australian plate, which forms the Tonga and Kermadec Trenches, and the parallel Tonga and Kermadec island arcs. It has also uplifted the eastern parts of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

The continent of Zealandia, which separated from Australia and stretches from New Caledonia in the north to New Zealand&#x27;s subantarctic islands in the south, is now being torn apart along the transform boundary marked by the Alpine Fault.

South of New Zealand the boundary becomes a transitional transform-convergent boundary, the Macquarie Fault Zone, where the Australian plate is beginning to subduct under the Pacific plate along the Puysegur Trench. Extending southwest of this trench is the Macquarie Ridge.

The southerly side is a divergent boundary with the Antarctic plate called the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR).

The subducting boundary through Indonesia is not parallel to the biogeographical Wallace line that separates the indigenous fauna of Asia from that of Australasia. The eastern islands of Indonesia lie mainly on the Eurasian plate, but have Australasian-related fauna and flora. Southeasterly lies the Sunda Shelf.

To the east of Indonesia there appears to be under the Indian Ocean a deformation zone between the Indian and Australian plates with both earthquake and global satellite navigation system data indicating that India and Australia are not moving on the same vectors northward and have started a process of again separating. This zone is along the northern Ninety East Ridge which implies this area presently is weaker tectonically than the area where originally the Indian and Australian plates merged which is believed to have been further to the north west. There is also deformation in an approximately zone north of the Southeast Indian Ridge between the Australian plate and the proposed Capricorn plate.

== Origins ==

It is known that the Eastern Pilbara Craton within present day Western Australia, contains some of the oldest surface rocks on earth being pristine crust up to 3.8 billion years ago. Accordingly, the Pilbara Craton continues to be studied for clues as to the commencement and subsequent course of plate tectonics.

Depositional age of the Mount Barren Group on the southern margin of the Yilgarn Craton and zircon provenance analysis support the hypothesis that collisions between the Pilbara–Yilgarn and Yilgarn–Gawler Cratons assembled a proto-Australian continent approximately (Dawson et al. 2002).

Australia and East Antarctica were merged with Gondwana between 570 and starting in the Ediacaran (South African Kuunga Orogeny).

As a separate plate, the Australian plate came into being on the breakup of Gondwana with final separation from what is now the Antarctic plate and Zealandia starting in the Early Cretaceous between about and finishing in the Cenomanian at about . The separation continued with various authors modelling full separation time based on sea levels and/or biological separation. A currently widely used reference model for plate movement has total separation of Tasmania by 60 million years ago although some had argued historically that this was as recent as 45 million years ago.

== Speed ==
The Australian plate, which Australia is on, is moving faster than other plates. The Australian plate is moving about 6.9 cm (2.7 inches) a year in a northward direction and with a small clockwise rotation. The Global Positioning System must be updated due to the movement, as some locations move faster.

Technically movement is a vector and requires to be related to something. Much of the work involved in determining these plate vectors involves assurance that the points of reference are representative of the plates they are on, as distortion will be likely in areas of tectonic activity. Further assumptions such as there are only 8 plates were made in earlier modelling when as many as 52 may exist, with independent movement, although fair accuracy for larger plate movement can be obtained if only 25 are modelled.

In terms of the middle of India and Australia landmasses, with Australia as the point of reference, presently Australia is moving northward at per year with respect to India consistent with a zone of deformation between the two plates as commented upon earlier. This zone of deformation may actually presently involve some of India.

The northwards collision of the Australian plate with the Sunda plate (Sundaland plate, previously classified as part of Eurasian plate) has a maximum convergence velocity of per year ± per year at the Java Trench decreasing to ± per year at the southern Sumatra Trench.

The eastern collision with the Pacific plate has increasing displacement rates towards the north from a low of less than per year at the southern end of the Macquarie Fault Zone, where there is the major plate triple junction with the Pacific and Antarctic plates. Due to vector complexities at the north eastern end of this collision, which includes several spreading centres, it is perhaps simplest to state that the average displacement rate to the north is about half that of the collision with the Sunda plate, but this would not explain some of the largest and most destructive recent earthquakes and eruptions on the face of the planet.

There is oblique convergence of what are now the Pacific and Australian plates at about near eastern Papua New Guinea. This has resulted in shear complexities, resolved by the formation of multiple microplates and convergence velocity that varies between where the Solomon Sea plate subducts under the South Bismarck plate and Pacific plate at the New Britain subduction zone. To the south of this there is sea floor spreading between the Australian plate and the Woodlark plate in the Woodlark Basin while the subduction of the oceanic crust of the Australian plate occurs to the south east in the New Hebrides Trench of the Vanuatu subduction zone under the New Hebrides plate. As we go south the convergence rate falls from north of the Torres Islands to in the central section of the trench, to rise again to in the south.

Very active spreading then resumes in the North Fiji Basin where the edge of the Australian plate makes a transition in a bend up towards the north-east via the transform faults of the Hunter fracture zone to Fiji. The Australian plate interacts at the southern and south-eastern border of the North Fiji Basin with the microplates of the New Hebrides already mentioned, as well as with the Conway Reef plate and the Balmoral Reef plates. To the west of Fiji the Australian plate interacts in the spreading centre of the Lau Basin with the Niuafo&#x27;ou plate and the clockwise rotating Tonga plate under which the Pacific plate is subducting in the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone. The back arc spreading in the Lau Basin continues almost due south in the line of interaction between the Australian and Tonga plates to the Kermadec plate and on to New Zealand where direct interaction resumes with the Pacific plate south of the Taupō Volcanic Zone and such direct interaction continues into the Macquarie Fault Zone to the south of New Zealand. There is up to per year motion accommodated with complex rotational components in the collision dynamics between the north eastern Australian plate and the rotating Tonga plate, the long thin Kermadec plate and the south western aspects of the Pacific plate. The Pacific plate east to west convergence rates along the subduction systems with the Kermadec plate, which are perhaps simpler to state, are among the fastest on Earth, being per year in the north and per year in the south.

At the central Alpine Fault in New Zealand the subduction component of the Pacific plate moving westward is about per year. The Australian plate then to the south starts subducting under the Pacific plate at a rate of at the Puysegur Trench, which ends in the south as a long series of transform faults between the two plates called the Macquarie Ridge Complex, commencing with the McDougall Fault Zone and ending with the Macquarie Fault Zone. The south western portion of the zone has the Pacific plate interacting with an area of the Australian plate that the latest tectonic models suggest is still independent from when it first achieved independent rotation to the then Indo-Australian plate several million years ago, the Macquarie microplate.

Data from the long Southeast Indian Ridge only became available after about 1985 and this gives a fairly consistent spreading rate between the Antarctic and Australian plates of per year at a heading of 80° (slightly north of due east, at the Amsterdam transform fault to the south western side of Australian plate), per year with heading 120° (southeast) and per year near the Macquarie triple junction which is the south eastern side of the Australian plate.

The Capricorn plate at the western side of the Australian plate is moving at per year ± per year with heading 45° (northwest) relative to the Australia plate.

<text>Section 8 was a category of military discharge employed by the United States Armed Forces which was used for servicemembers judged mentally unfit for service. The term &quot;Section 8&quot; eventually came to mean any service member given such a discharge, or behaving as if deserving such a discharge, as in the expression, &quot;he&#x27;s a Section 8&quot;.

This type of discharge could be granted for a wide variety of perceived problems, including low intelligence, incompatibility with core military expectations or responsibilities, alcoholism or other chronic addictions, personality disorders, pathological lying, psychopathy, personality disorders, enuresis (then believed to be a mental disorder), psychosis or antisocial behavior. A variety of sexual conduct could result in a Section 8 discharge, including cross-dressing, homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality and transgenderism; along with necrophilia, bestiality and pederasty.

==History==
The term comes from Section VIII of the World War II–era United States Army Regulation 615–360, concerning the separation of enlisted men from military service. Section VIII provided for the discharge of men who were deemed mentally unfit for military service.

A Section 8 discharge could be honorable or dishonorable, depending on the circumstances of each case.

Section 8 discharges were often given to members of the LGBT community, as they were deemed mentally unfit to serve in the military. A Section 8 discharge for homosexuality of other sexual conduct was dishonorable, and often made it difficult for people to find work in civilian life and did not allow for veterans benefits. An official military report indicates &quot;Relatively few military personnel were discharged from the Army during World War II for homosexuality&quot;, but admits existing data are not entirely reliable.

Discharge under Section 8 is no longer practiced, as medical discharges for psychological or psychiatric reasons are now covered by a number of regulations. In the Army, such discharges are handled under the provisions of AR 635–200, &quot;Active Duty Enlisted Administrative Separations&quot;. Chapter 5, paragraph 13 governs the separation of personnel medically diagnosed with a personality disorder.

==In popular culture==

* Section 8 became a household phrase when used in the 1970s TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, in which the character Corporal Klinger was continually seeking one but his efforts were denied due to his transparent malingering and until he eventually abandoned his efforts. His preferred method of doing so was cross-dressing, but other attempts included threatening to set himself on fire and consuming a Jeep piece by piece.
* In the 2007 video game &quot;Halo 3&quot;, the marine allies will occasionally ask the player if they have &#x27;gone Section 8&#x27; if they shoot them. If the player kills too many of them, one may yell &#x27;He&#x27;s gone Section 8!&#x27; and start shooting the player back.
* In the 2019 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare&quot;, the character Sgt. Wayne Dylan Davis (&quot;D-Day&quot;) is given a Section 8 discharge after the failed rescue attempt of a teammate
*In the 2003 movie &quot;Basic&quot;, a DEA agent Tom Hardy (John Travolta) investigates a group of apparently insane mercenary Rangers turned drug dealers calling themselves Section 8.
* In Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; the character of Pvt. Leonard &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; Lawrence (Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio) is described as potentially being a Section 8 when it is noticed that he talks to his rifle, and another rifleman in the Lusthog Squad, aptly named Hand Job, was sent to a Navy psychologist due to excessive masturbation (as Cowboy put it, &quot;jerking off 10 times a day&quot;) and was instantly classified as a Section 8 after he started masturbating in the waiting room.
* American deathcore band Whitechapel featured a song called &quot;Section 8&quot; on their self-titled album from 2012.
* In the war novel &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; the character Elwin &quot;Leper&quot; Lepellier gets a Section 8 discharge from the ski troops because he was hallucinating due to sleep deprivation.
* In the 1993 film &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, the character Travis goes rogue, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve gone full fucking Section 8!&quot;
* In the 2022 film &quot;Section Eight&quot;, a group of discharged soldiers become secret assassins.
* In the 1998 film When Trumpets Fade, the character Private David Manning tried to avoid combat by asking for Section 8 from his company commander Captain Roy Pritchett which he was promoted to Sergeant instead. Later on Pritchett offer Manning a Section 8 discharge if he volunteer and succeeded in taking out Germany 88 Battery.

==Notable examples==
During World War II, in November 1943, at age 17, actor Sidney Poitier lied about his age and enlisted in the Army. He was assigned to a Veteran&#x27;s Administration hospital in Northport, New York, and was trained to work with psychiatric patients. Poitier became upset with how the hospital treated its patients and feigned mental illness to obtain a discharge. Poitier confessed to a psychiatrist that he was faking his condition, but the doctor was sympathetic and granted his discharge under Section VIII of Army regulation 615–360 in December 1944.

<text>The New Zealand Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector (OCVS) was established in 2003. It was administered by the Ministry of Social Development until February 2011, when it became part of the Department of Internal Affairs.

== Purpose ==

The Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector&#x27;s vision is for a strong community-government relationship. In practice, this means providing an accessible central contact point for government agencies in their work with the community and voluntary sector, and promoting good practice models between government agencies and their community sector partners.

== Work Programme ==

As well as providing advice to the Minister and Associate Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, the OCVS has five inter-related parts to its work programme: 
*supporting work to build the capacity of the sector, such as funding the Community Sector Taskforce to undertake community-driven initiatives
*building knowledge about the community sector and volunteering, for example, work on the Study of the New Zealand Non-profit Sector that helped provide a clearer picture of the nature and extent of non-profit sector activity within New Zealand
*providing other government agencies with advice on overcoming policy barriers and addressing issues of concern to the community and voluntary sector
*actively supporting the development and promotion of good practice by government agencies when engaging with or funding the sector, for example through the ‘good practice in action’ seminar series. 
* promoting generosity - the giving of time and money - such as working with Volunteering New Zealand to help promote International Volunteer Day and Volunteer Awareness Week, and with Inland Revenue to inform people about payroll giving.

== Some key facts about &quot;New Zealand’s non-profit sector: &quot; ==

*It has more than 97,000 non-profit organisations.
*New Zealand&#x27;s non-profit sector contributes 2.6% to GDP.
*This increases to $6.95 billion (or 4.9% of GDP) when taking into account the volunteer labour contribution. (This is similar to the contribution of the entire construction industry.)
*The sector contains more than 1.2 million volunteers who give more than 270 million hours of unpaid labour to the sector. 
*Non-profits have over 105,000 paid employees – but only 10% of all non-profit organisations employ paid staff (the other 90% rely entirely on volunteers).

== Publications and resources ==
The Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector operates two &quot;toolkit sites&quot; to assist New Zealand public servants in their work with community and voluntary sector organisations:

*Good Practice Participate
*Good Practice Funding

The OCVS also offers a number of publications of interest, which provide more detail on the community and voluntary sector in New Zealand:

*&quot;an electronic newsletter &quot; is produced eight times a year 
*&quot;Quarterly Generosity Indicators&quot; measuring the giving of time, money and goods
*&quot;Keeping it Legal E Ai Ki Te Ture&quot; – Legal Responsibilities of Voluntary Organisations (Dec 2005)
*&quot;Briefing to the Incoming Minister:&quot; 
*&quot;Mahi Aroha&quot; - Māori perspectives on volunteering and cultural obligations
*&quot;Managing Well&quot; – Resources for Community and Voluntary Organisations (Aug 2005)
*&quot;Government Policy on Volunteering&quot; (Dec 2002)
*&quot;He Waka Kotuia&quot; – Joining Together on a Shared Journey: Report of the Community-Government Relationship Steering Group (Aug 2002)
*&quot;Communities and Government – Potential for Partnership&quot;: Summary Report of the Community and Voluntary Sector Working Party (Apr 2001)

The above publications can be viewed on the website or requested from the OCVS (e-mail: ocvs@dia.govt.nz).

<doc id="891807" wikidata="Q1754287" url="?curid=891807" title="At Play in the Fields of the Lord">
<text>At Play in the Fields of the Lord is a 1991 epic adventure drama film directed by Héctor Babenco, adapted from the 1965 novel of the same name by American author Peter Matthiessen. The screenplay was written by Babenco and Jean-Claude Carrière, and stars Tom Berenger, John Lithgow, Daryl Hannah, Aidan Quinn, Tom Waits and Kathy Bates.

Director and producer James Cameron stated that &quot;At Play in the Fields of the Lord&quot; was used as a reference for the 2009 blockbuster film &quot;Avatar&quot;.

==Plot==
A pair of explorers, Lewis Moon and Wolf, become stranded in &quot;Mãe de Deus&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Mother of God&quot;), an outpost in the deep Brazilian Amazon River basin, after their plane runs out of fuel.

The local police commander wants the Niaruna tribe, living upriver, to move their village so they will not be killed by gold miners moving into the area and cause trouble for him with the provincial government. The commander cuts a deal with Moon: if he and his fellow mercenary would bomb the Niaruna village from the air and drive them away, they will be given enough fuel for their airplane and be allowed to leave.

Born-again Christian evangelist (and missionary) Martin Quarrier and his wife Hazel arrive with their son Billy, to spread the Christian gospel to the Niaruna indigenous natives. They arrive in Mãe de Deus to meet fellow missionaries Leslie and Andy Huben, who live with a Niaruna helper. In town, they meet a Catholic priest who wants to re-establish a mission to the Niarunas, as the former missionary was killed by them.

Moon and Wolf leave in their plane to attack the Niaruna. But upon seeing the community with his own eyes as well as a native American firing an arrow at the plane, Moon has second thoughts. The plane returns to Mãe de Deus.

That night, after a discussion with Wolf, Quarrier and the priest, Moon takes a native drug and begins hallucinating. He takes off alone in his plane and parachutes into the Niaruna village. Moon, a half-Native American Cheyenne, aligns himself with the Niarunas. He is accepted as &quot;Kisu-Mu&quot;, one of the Niaruna gods, and begins to adapt to Niaruna life and culture.

The four evangelists travel upriver to establish their mission. Native Americans originally converted by the Catholics turn up, awaiting the arrival of the Niaruna. Eventually they do come and accept the gifts that the Quarriers offer, not staying long.

Young Billy dies of blackwater fever (a serious complication of malaria), causing Hazel to lose her sanity. She is returned to Mãe de Deus. Martin becomes despondent, arguing with Leslie and gradually losing his faith.

Meanwhile, Moon encounters Andy swimming nude. After they kiss, Moon catches her cold. He returns to the Niaruna camp and inadvertently infects everyone. Much of the tribe becomes sick. Moon and the tribe&#x27;s leaders go to the missionary Leslie to beg for drugs.

Leslie refuses, but Martin agrees to provide the drugs. He travels to the Niaruna village with the missionaries&#x27; young helper. In the village, after Martin speaks with Moon, helicopters arrive to begin bombing. Martin survives the bombing, but is killed by his helper soon after. Moon is exposed as a man and not a god. He runs, ending up alone.

==Background==
Producer Saul Zaentz first tried to make this film in 1965. He discovered that MGM owned the rights to Peter Matthiessen&#x27;s novel. Zaentz continued to try to buy the property every time there was a top executive change at MGM until 1989, when the new studio heads Jay Kanter and Alan Ladd, Jr. decided that MGM would not make the film. Zaentz then paid $1.4 million for the rights. In 1983, both Taylor Hackford and Keith Barish attempted to get the film, but the company would end up getting sued by MGM/UA Entertainment Co. for breaching an agreement to co-develop the film.

The picture was filmed in Belém, Pará, Brazil.

==Release==
It was released to theaters in the U.S. on December 6, 1991.

==Home Video==
The film was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1992.

It was available at one point in 2020, to buy or rent digitally (in standard definition only) via Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube.

The film was released on DVD on September 26, 2023 by Mill Creek Entertainment. The disc contains a fullscreen 1.33:1 version of the film, along with another film, &quot;The Apostle&quot; .

==Critical reception==
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 57% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on reviews from 7 critics.

Noted &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert, who had read the novel and believed the film is true to its themes, awarded the film 3 and a half out of 4 stars. In his review, Ebert makes the case that producer Saul Zaentz has a history of producing &quot;unfilmable&quot; source material. He wrote, &quot;Watching it, we are looking at a morality play about a world in which sincere people create unwitting mischief so that evil people can have their way. The movie essentially argues that all peoples have a right to worship their own gods without interference, but it goes further to observe that if your god lives in the land and the trees, then if we destroy your land, we kill your god. These messages are buried in the very fabric of the film, in the way it was shot, in its use of locations, and we are not told them, we absorb them.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had mixed feelings about the film but did like the acting and the screenplay, and wrote, &quot;&quot;At Play in the Fields of the Lord&quot; doesn&#x27;t play smoothly, but it often plays well ... Mr. Lithgow and Miss Hannah, who grows more secure as an actress with every film, are fine in complex roles that are exceptionally well written ... Though the film features a spectacular penultimate sequence, it seems not to know how to end. It sort of drifts away, perhaps trying to soften its own well-earned pessimism.&quot;

Critic Jeffrey Westhoff writing for &quot;Northwest Herald&quot; expressed dislike for the film, stating, &quot;Some books should remain books.&quot;

<doc id="891809" wikidata="Q3569700" url="?curid=891809" title="Section 8 (housing)">
<text>Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 (), commonly known as Section 8, provides rental housing assistance to low-income households in the United States by paying private landlords on behalf of these tenants. Approximately 68% of this assistance benefits seniors, children, and individuals with disabilities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees Section 8 programs, which are administered locally by public housing agencies (PHAs).

In 2022, about 2.3 million out of the 5.2 million households receiving rental assistance used Section 8 vouchers. While landlord participation in the program is voluntary in most areas, some states and municipalities have enacted laws that prohibit source of income discrimination, including discrimination against individuals whose income is derived from Section 8 housing vouchers. Voucher amounts vary depending on city or county, size of unit, and other factors. Voucher recipients typically have 2 to 4 months to secure housing that meets HUD standards; otherwise, they lose their vouchers and must reapply. Wait lists for vouchers can be very long, ranging from 10 to 20 years, with many local programs closed to new applicants.

Voucher amounts are based on Fair Market Rents (FMRs) set by HUD. The recently introduced Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) program refines these calculations to the zip code level in major metropolitan areas.

==History==
Federal housing assistance programs started during the Great Depression. In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government created subsidy programs to increase the production of low-income housing and to help families pay their rent. In 1965, the Section 236 Leased Housing Program amended the U.S. Housing Act. This subsidy program, the predecessor to the modern program, was not a pure housing allowance program. Housing authorities selected eligible families from their waiting list, placed them in housing from a master list of available units, and determined the rent that tenants would have to pay. The housing authority would then sign a lease with the private landlord and pay the difference between the tenant&#x27;s rent and the market rate for the same size unit. In the agreement with the private landlord, housing authorities agreed to perform regular building maintenance and leasing functions for Section 236 tenants, and annually reviewed the tenant&#x27;s income for program eligibility and rent calculations.

The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 introduced the federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program (EHAP) and the Community Development Corporation and authorized larger outlays for housing subsidy programs and rent supplements for moderate-income households.

In the 1970s, when studies showed that the worst housing problem afflicting low-income people was no longer substandard housing, but the high percentage of income spent on housing, Congress passed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, further amending the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 to create the Section 8 Program. In the Section 8 Program, tenants pay about 30 percent of their income for rent, while the rest of the rent is paid with federal money.

The Section 8 program initially had three subprograms—New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, and Existing Housing Certificate programs. The Moderate Rehabilitation Program was added in 1978, the Voucher Program in 1983, and the Project-based Certificate program in 1991. The number of units a local housing authority can subsidize under its Section 8 programs is determined by Congressional funding. Since its inception, some Section 8 programs have been phased out and new ones created, although Congress has always renewed existing subsidies.

The 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Public Law 110-161) enacted December 26, 2007, allocated $75 million in funding for the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) voucher program, authorized under section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937. This new program combines HUD Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance for homeless veterans with case management and clinical service support which is provided by the Veterans Affairs administration at its own medical centers and also in the community.

The Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA) was signed into law on July 29, 2016, and amended the United States Housing Act of 1937 and made changes to several federal housing programs, particularly Section 8. Key provisions include reforms to income calculation methods, adjustments to asset limits, and modifications to the income review processes.

==Summary==
The main Section 8 program involves the voucher program. A voucher may be either &quot;project-based&quot;—where its use is limited to a specific apartment complex (public housing agencies (PHAs) may reserve up to 20% of its vouchers as such)—or &quot;tenant-based&quot;, where the tenant is free to choose a unit in the private sector, is not limited to specific complexes, and may reside anywhere in the United States (or Puerto Rico) where a PHA operates a Section 8 program.

Under the voucher program, individuals or families with a voucher find and lease a unit (either in a specified complex or in the private sector) and pay a portion of the rent. Most households pay 30% of their adjusted income for Section 8 housing. Adjusted income is a household&#x27;s gross (total) income minus deductions for dependents under 18 years of age, full-time students, disabled persons, or an elderly household, and certain disability assistance and medical expenses.

There is an asset test in addition to earned income. Over a certain amount, HUD will add income even if the Section 8 tenant does not receive any interest income from, for example, a bank account. HUD calls this &quot;imputed income from assets&quot; and, in the case of a bank account, HUD establishes a standard &quot;Passbook Savings Rate&quot; to calculate the imputed income from the asset. By increasing the amount of a tenant&#x27;s total income, the amount of imputed income from assets may affect a tenant&#x27;s assigned portion of rent.

The PHA pays the landlord the remainder of the rent. Each year, the federal government looks at the rents being charged for privately owned apartments in different communities, as well as the costs of utilities (heat, electricity, etc.) in those communities. The Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are amounts (rents plus utilities) for medium-quality apartments of different sizes in a particular community. As an example, the 2012 FMR for 1 bedroom housing in San Francisco is $1,522 and in New York is $1,280, while in many other places it is less than $500.

The landlord cannot charge a Section 8 tenant more than a reasonable rent and cannot accept payments outside the contract.

Landlords, although required to meet fair housing laws, are not required to participate in the Section 8 program. As a result, some landlords will not accept a Section 8 tenant. This can be attributed to such factors as:
* not wanting the government involved in their business, such as having a full inspection of their premises by government workers for HUD&#x27;s Housing Quality Standards (HQS) and the possible remediations required
* a desire to charge rent for the unit above FMR

Depending on state laws, refusing to rent to a tenant solely for the reason that they have Section 8 may be illegal. Landlords can use only general means of disqualifying a tenant (credit, criminal history, past evictions, etc.). It also may be illegal to post &quot;No Section 8&quot; advertisements.

However, other landlords willingly accept Section 8 tenants, due to:
* a large available pool of potential renters (the waiting list for new Section 8 tenants is usually very long, see below)
* Regular and generally prompt payments from the PHA for its share of the rent
* tenants&#x27; incentive to take good care of the property (PHAs require that tenants not damage rental properties. In many instances a tenant may be removed from the program if they owe money to a previous landlord).

Whether voucher- or project-based, all subsidized units must meet the HQS, thus ensuring that the family has a healthy and safe place to live. This improvement in the landlord&#x27;s private property is an important byproduct of this program, both for the individual families and for the larger goal of community development.

===Applicants===
Applicants may apply for a Section 8 housing voucher at any county or city housing authority office. Although rules vary across housing authorities, residents of a particular area who receive a voucher from the jurisdiction in which they live may use the voucher anywhere in the country, but nonresidents of the jurisdiction must live in the jurisdiction that issues the voucher to them for 12 months before they can move to a different area. 

In many localities, the PHA waiting lists for Section 8 vouchers may be thousands of households long, waits of three to six years to obtain vouchers are common, and many lists are closed to new applicants. Wait lists are often briefly opened (often for just five days), which may occur as little as once every seven years. To manage excess demand, PHAs often create preference policies that place specific categories of applicants at the top of wait lists. Some PHAs also use a &quot;lottery&quot; approach, where there can be as many as 100,000 applicants for 10,000 spots on the waitlist, with spots being awarded on the basis of weighted or non-weighted lotteries. Priority is often extended to local residents, disabled people, veterans, and the elderly. There is no guarantee that anyone will ever be selected from a wait list.

===Family obligations===
Families who participate in the program must abide by a series of rules and regulations, often referred to as &quot;family obligations&quot;, in order to maintain their voucher, including accurately reporting to the PHA all changes in household income and family composition so the amount of their subsidy (and the applicable rental unit size limitation) can be updated accordingly.

== Fair Market Rents ==
Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are calculated to determine how much a landlord is able to accept for rent of a unit to a Section 8 voucher recipient. FMRs are gross rental rates and dictate the maximum rental rate to be agreed upon in a lease document. The calculation of FMRs is based on a standard quality rent from the five year American Community Survey, as well as a recent mover adjustment, which is the relationship between the standard quality for five years and the one year recent mover rents. FMRs also include a CPI adjustment and a trend factor adjustment. The trend factor adjustment is how HUD expects rental rates to grow.

FMRs include all major utilities (heat, electricity, etc.), but does not include telephone, cable, satellite television, or internet service. Utilities are included in FMRs whether the obligation of payment is under the tenant or the landlord. FMRs can be found using HUD&#x27;s Database.

=== Small Area Fair Market Rents ===
The Small Area Fair Market Rents Program (SAFMRP) was officially implemented by HUD in January 2017. This system is an update to the system HUD uses to calculate Fair Market Rents (FMRs) in metropolitan areas. The purpose is to examine metropolitan area FMRs by ZIP code, as opposed to in total. HUD stated that this program is aimed to allow voucher recipients to move into higher opportunity areas and reduce the concentration of voucher recipients in a given metropolitan area. While the program was originally intended to be mandatory for several metropolitan areas immediately, the requirement for the use of SAFRMs was delayed to October 1, 2019. SAFMRs can now be found through the HUD database.

The implementation of this program follows a demonstration project coordinated by HUD in 2010. The project included the following Public Housing Authorities (PHAs): The Housing Authority of the County of Cook (IL), the City of Long Beach (CA) Housing Authority, the Chattanooga (TN) Housing Authority, the Town of Mamaroneck (NY) Housing Authority, and the Housing Authority of Laredo (TX).

An early report states that the effects of this program need to be analyzed over a long period of time before determining results. Vincent Reina, Arthur Acolin, and Raphael W. Bostic published an early examination of the new SAFMRP in 2019. This study finds varied results in the SAFMRP based on different metropolitan areas. Two areas of note are the highest performing city in the study and the lowest, Dallas, TX, and Chattanooga, TN, respectively. The authors argue that Dallas performed well with the SAFMRP because the city was required by court order to implement the program, and the program has been in place for longer than all other cities in the study. The authors state that the benefits of the SAFMRP change over time and analysis of the program must include a time series analysis for all effects.

The authors also explain why Chattanooga, TN may have performed the lowest in the study. Two reasons include the fact that most rental units were already inaccessible areas, and most residential areas in Chattanooga are low opportunity, therefore voucher recipients did not have increased choice with the implementation of the program.

== Earned Income Disallowance ==
There is a provision for disabled people who have a Section 8 subsidized dwelling to have their rent frozen for a specified time if they are working part-time below a certain income level. This is called the Earned Income Disallowance or Earned Income Disregard (EID) and is stipulated under US 24 CFR 5.617, &quot;Self-sufficiency incentives for persons with disabilities—Disallowance of increase in annual income&quot;. This was enacted as part of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) (Sec. 508(b); 42 U.S.C. 1437a(d)). This requires Public Housing Authorities and some owners, in calculating rent, to temporarily &quot;disregard&quot; increased income earned when certain public housing residents and disabled participants in certain housing assistance programs return/go to work or job-related programs. The idea is to foster self-sufficiency for those who are on subsidies and disability and other assistance.

== Studies ==

Howard Husock, vice president for policy research at the conservative Manhattan Institute, heavily criticized Section 8 in a 2003 book on housing policy as a vehicle for exporting inner city social problems to the suburbs.

Hanna Rosin, an American journalist, has argued that Section 8 has led to crime being more evenly spread out across U.S. metropolitan areas, without any net decrease. This was the core thesis of her article published by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2008, in which she linked Section 8 to a crime wave in the Memphis, Tennessee, metropolitan area. Rosin&#x27;s article attempted to position Memphis as just one particularly troubling example of a nationwide trend: &quot;Still, researchers around the country are seeing the same basic pattern: projects coming down in inner cities and crime pushing outward, in many cases destabilizing cities or their surrounding areas.&quot; Rosin&#x27;s article has been highly influential among politicians in cities claiming to be negatively affected by Section 8, such as Lancaster, California.

Rosin&#x27;s article was later criticized by Greg Anrig in an article published on &quot;The American Prospect&quot;. In the article, Anrig accuses Rosin of placing an excessive amount of blame on housing policy for the reported increase in crime. The article refers to the fact that Rosin never made a conclusive argument that those who participate in Section 8 were responsible for the higher rates of crime, as those who receive housing support are subject to screenings based on drug use and previous criminal activity. Rosin instead relies on a heat map of crime created by Richard Janikowski and Phyllis Betts who is reported to have said they were &quot;[...] amazed – and deflated – to see how perfectly the two data sets fit together.&quot;

Janikowski and Betts later disavowed any connection between housing vouchers and increases in crime in the area in a later letter to the editor of the Atlantic. Rosin failed to mention that there was a consistent decrease and increase in crime from inner cities to inner-ring suburbs across most metropolitan areas due to shifting populations. Anrig argues that economic factors are more likely responsible for Memphis&#x27;s increase in crime, as male unemployment almost doubled between the years of 1990 and 2000. Anrig also refers to Moving to Opportunity (MTO), a randomized policy experiment. The study concludes that there was no increase in violent crime for the participants of subsidized housing or their surrounding neighborhoods in the five cities tested; Memphis was not a part of the study. Even though the participants were far more likely to stay in poorer areas when given the chance to leave, families still received modest academic and psychological benefits. In fact, according to a paper prepared for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of Policy Development and Research rather than an increasing crime, those who use housing vouchers are more likely to move into areas where crime is increasing.

=== Housing specialists ===
Matthew Marr published a study of the Los Angeles housing market in the Summer of 2001 that examines the effects of housing placement specialists on the Section 8 voucher program. Marr finds that housing placement specialists function as an intermediary between tenants and landlords that help increase the mobility of Section 8 voucher recipients.

Tight rental markets can pose a challenge to Section 8 voucher recipients. Marr finds, through observations and interviews, that the resource of housing placement specialists can help prevent private landlord apprehension, and help voucher recipients navigate the program and general rental market. Landlord apprehension can be a result of many factors. Marr shows that it is rooted in racial stereotypes of tenants and slow government bureaucracy. Other qualitative data indicates some factors to be: tenant behavior and financial burden. These factors are some areas in which housing specialists work to mitigate problems.

<doc id="891812" wikidata="Q765854" url="?curid=891812" title="Naval Criminal Investigative Service">
<text>The United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is the primary investigative law enforcement agency of the U.S. Department of the Navy. Its primary function is to investigate major criminal activities involving the Navy and Marine Corps. However, its broad mandate includes national security, counterintelligence, counterterrorism, cyberwarfare, and the protection of U.S. naval assets worldwide. NCIS is the successor organization to the former Naval Investigative Service (NIS), which was established by the Office of Naval Intelligence after the Second World War. One-half of NCIS personnel are civilian, with the other half being US government investigators — 1811 series special agents. NCIS agents are armed federal law enforcement investigators, who frequently coordinate with other U.S. government agencies and have a presence in more than 41 countries and on U.S. Navy vessels. NCIS special agents are supported by analysts and other experts skilled in disciplines such as forensics, surveillance, surveillance countermeasures, computer investigations, physical security, and polygraph examinations.

==History==

===Origins===
NCIS traces its roots to Navy Department General Order 292 of 1882, signed by William H. Hunt, Secretary of the Navy, which established the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Initially, ONI was tasked with collecting information on the characteristics and weaponry of foreign vessels, charting foreign passages, rivers, or other bodies of water, and touring overseas fortifications, industrial plants, and shipyards. In anticipation of the United States entry into World War I, ONI&#x27;s responsibilities expanded to include espionage, sabotage, and all manner of information on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s potential adversaries. The plan contemplated obtaining information by both overt and covert means, and, in the fall of 1916, the first branch office (a small undercover unit) was established in New York City under the supervision of the ONI. Heavy reliance was placed on reserve, active duty, and civilian operatives, many of the latter serving voluntarily and without pay. Rapid demobilization and the desire to return to normalcy after World War I saw investigative activity reduced to a virtual standstill. In early 1926, initiatives were undertaken to organize special groups of volunteer reserve intelligence officers who were envisioned to obtain information on persons and activities that might threaten the naval establishment, as well as provide a cadre of trained personnel in the event of a national emergency.

During the early and mid-1930s, the development of an independent professional investigative capability within the Navy was being nurtured. In Washington, D.C., the first civilian agent was employed in 1936 on a verbal basis and paid by personal check of the Director of Naval Intelligence. He was followed by a small handful of civilian special agents who were seeded throughout the naval districts beginning in 1936, although by September 1937 they numbered only 14 nationwide. In June 1939, President Roosevelt directed that ONI handle the investigation of Navy cases relating to sabotage, espionage, and subversive activities. By the fall of 1940, selective call-up of intelligence reservists for investigative and counterintelligence duties was undertaken on a broad scale and following entry into World War II, the Navy&#x27;s investigative arm was staffed almost exclusively by reserve officers. Their primary tasks related to personnel security inquiries, sabotage, and espionage cases, investigation of Japanese activities in the United States, and war fraud matters. A peak was reached in 1943 when over 97,000 separate investigations were conducted by what was known as the &quot;Naval Intelligence Service.&quot; After World War II, there was again a general demobilization, resulting in only a small corps of civilian special agents being retained. Although the Secretary of the Navy extended investigative jurisdiction in 1945, no meaningful expansion of personnel occurred until the Korean conflict when a major buildup of civilian agents took place.

===NIS and the Cold War===
Until the late 1950s, District Intelligence Office operations were under the command supervision of Naval District Commandants, and investigative effort was frequently parochial, fragmented, and on occasion, duplicative from one district to another. Workload, manpower, and jurisdiction in investigations and counterintelligence broadened following the Korean conflict. Several significant changes in organization and policy occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as refinements in mission, which culminated in the establishment of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) in February 1966. In the early 1970s, an NIS special agent was stationed on for six months. This marked the beginning of the &quot;Deployment Afloat&quot; program, now called the Special Agent Afloat program, which deploys special agents for year-long assignments aboard carrier battle groups and amphibious readiness groups. In 1972, background investigations were transferred from NIS to the newly formed Defense Investigative Service (DIS), allowing NIS to give more attention to criminal investigations and counter-intelligence. The 1970s also saw NIS&#x27; first female agent, who was stationed at Naval Air Station Miramar, California in 1975.
In October 1981, NIS became a Second Echelon Command under the Chief of Naval Operations. In August 1985, the Secretary of the Navy directed the appointment of a flag-rank naval officer to hold the position of Commander, NIS, reporting directly to the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of the Navy. Rear Admiral Cathal L. Flynn, a Navy SEAL officer, became the first admiral to lead NIS. Additionally, in 1982, two classes of NIS Special Agents were trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia, in an assessment of the school&#x27;s capability to train military investigators. Before this and subsequently until 1984, NIS Special Agent Training was in ONI Headquarters in Suitland, Maryland. In 1984, NIS Special Agents began training at FLETC, along with other federal investigative agencies, except for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.

Two months after the October 1983 bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, the agency opened the Anti-Terrorist Alert Center (ATAC), a 24-hour-a-day operational intelligence center that issued indications and warnings on terrorist activity to Navy and Marine Corps commands. ATAC was the facility at which Jonathan Pollard was working when he committed the acts of espionage for which he was convicted in 1987. In 2002 the ATAC became the Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC). On November 15, 1985, NIS was re-designated as the Naval Security and Investigative Command (NSIC) and broadened its missions to include management of the DON Security Program. These programs included naval information, physical, and personnel security; adjudication for security clearances; and Navy law enforcement and physical security. This resulted in NSIC also assuming control of the Navy&#x27;s Master-at-Arms program and the military working dog program. In 1986, the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DoN CAF) was established and placed under the agency, as the agency was now once again responsible for adjudicating security clearances (although not the actual investigations). DoN CAF renders approximately 200,000 eligibility determinations annually for the Department of the Navy. On September 27, 1988, NSIC was changed to the Naval Investigative Service Command (NISC), though the organization at large was still known as the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) and the &quot;command&quot; generally referred only to the NIS headquarters element, similarly how the United States Army Criminal Investigation &quot;Command&quot; commanded all Criminal Investigation &quot;Division&quot; (CID) elements.

In 1991, NIS was responsible for investigating the Tailhook scandal, which involved allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment by Naval and Marine Corps officers in Las Vegas, Nevada. After this investigation, and at the direction of the chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn, the Naval Investigative Service was restructured into the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). The restructuring occurred as a result of perceived lapses in proper investigative technique over the Tailhook scandal, as well as chain of command issues and a lack of civilian oversight in previous investigations. At the time, Senator Nunn stated, &quot;The Navy&#x27;s whole investigative technique should be under serious question.&quot; As a result of the investigation into the Tailhook scandal, the Pentagon&#x27;s inspector general was sharply critical of NIS leadership, stating that there was a top-down culture showing a lack of cooperation with other authorities in the Navy. By 1992, Acting Secretary of the Navy, Sean O&#x27;Keefe, recommended the word &quot;Criminal&quot; be included in NIS&#x27;s name to make clear their investigative function. Ultimately, NIS commander, Rear Adm. Duvall Williams Jr., was forced to retire and NIS was reorganized as NCIS under civilian leadership.

===Recent history===
In 1993, the NCIS mission was again clarified and became a mostly civilian agency. Roy D. Nedrow, a former United States Secret Service (USSS) executive, was appointed as the first civilian director and the name changed from Naval Investigative Service Command to Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). NCIS was aligned as an echelon two activity under the Secretary of the Navy, via the General Counsel. Nedrow oversaw the restructuring of NCIS into a Federal law enforcement agency with 14 field offices controlling field operations in 140 locations worldwide. In 1995, NCIS introduced the Cold Case Homicide Unit, the first dedicated federal-level cold case homicide unit. The unit has resolved 61 cases since 1995. In May 1997, David L. Brant was appointed director of NCIS by Secretary of the Navy John Howard Dalton. Director Brant retired in December 2005. He was succeeded by Director Thomas A. Betro, who was appointed director of NCIS in January 2006, by Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter. Betro retired in September 2009. On September 13, 2009, Deputy Director of Operations Gregory A. Scovel was appointed acting director by Under Secretary of the Navy, Robert Work. He served concurrently as deputy director for operations until the new director was selected.

In 1999, NCIS and the Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division (USMC CID) signed a memorandum of understanding calling for the integration of Marine Corps CID into NCIS. (USMC CID continues to exist to investigate misdemeanor felonies and other criminal offenses not under NCIS investigative jurisdiction.)

In 2000, Congress granted NCIS civilian special agents authority to execute warrants and make arrests. Virtually all NCIS investigators, criminal, counterintelligence, and force protection personnel are now sworn civilian personnel with powers of arrest and warrant service. The exceptions are a small number of reserve military elements engaged in counter-intelligence support. A growing appreciation of the changing threat facing the Department of the Navy in the 21st century, culminating with the terrorist bombing of the in Yemen and the September 11 attacks, led NCIS to transform the Anti-Terrorist Alert Center into the Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC) in 2002. NCIS agents were the first U.S. law enforcement personnel on the scene at the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, the Limburg bombing and the terrorist attack in Mombasa, Kenya. NCIS has conducted fraud investigations resulting in over half a billion dollars in recoveries and restitution to the U.S. government and the U.S. Navy since 1997. NCIS investigates any death occurring on a Navy vessel or Navy or Marine Corps aircraft or installation (except when the cause of death is medically attributable to disease or natural causes). NCIS oversees the Master-at-Arms programs for the Navy, overseeing 8800 Masters-at-Arms and the Military Working Dog program. NCIS&#x27;s three strategic priorities are to prevent terrorism, protect secrets, and reduce crime. Current missions for NCIS include criminal investigations, force protection, cross-border drug enforcement, counterterrorism, major procurement fraud, computer crime and counter-intelligence.

NCIS Special Agent Peter Garza conducted the first court-ordered Internet wiretap in the United States.

Jonathan Jay Pollard was an NIS analyst who was convicted of spying for Israel after being caught by NIS and FBI. He received a life sentence in 1987.

On February 14, 2010, Mark D. Clookie became the fourth civilian director of NCIS, having been appointed to the position by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus. In June 2010, NCIS undertook a major reorganization that created a single deputy director position, having previously had two (deputy director of operations and deputy director of management and administration), a combination of the Combating Terrorism Directorate and the Counterintelligence Directorate into a single directorate (the National Security Directorate), and the creation of the Global Operations Directorate. The Global Operations Directorate was created to direct field elements in multiple functional areas that had previously been directed from NCIS Headquarters.

In December 2012, the FBI released redacted documents regarding operations against Occupy Wall Street. In one FBI report, the NCIS is quoted as looking into links between Occupy and &quot;organized labor actions&quot; in December 2011. In January 2013, the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DoN CAF) was consolidated, along with the other Central Adjudications Facilities within the Department of Defense (DoD), into a single organization, known as the DoD CAF, per the direction of the Deputy Secretary of Defense. The DoD CAF is currently the sole authority to determine security clearance eligibility of non-Intelligence Agency DoD personnel occupying sensitive positions and/or requiring access to classified material including Sensitive Compartmented Information. On October 7, 2013, Andrew L. Traver became the fifth civilian director of NCIS, having been appointed to the position by the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus. Traver leads an agency that is composed of some 2,500 civilian and military personnel and has a presence in over 150 locations worldwide. He is responsible for executing an annual operating budget of approximately $460 million.

In 2014, in the aftermath of the Washington Navy Yard shooting, NCIS formed the Regional Enforcement Action Capabilities Training (REACT) team, now known as the Regional Enforcement Action Capabilities Team. REACT teams are designed to support investigations and &quot;high-risk&quot; enforcement operations within the United States, including high-risk operations that involve the service of arrest and search warrants, undercover agent and source protection/rescue, undercover operations, high-risk surveillance, and high-risk protective assignments.

On June 4, 2019, Omar R. Lopez became the sixth civilian director of NCIS, having been appointed to the position by the Secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer. Director Lopez is responsible for approximately 2,000 personnel, including 1,000 federal special agents, in 191 locations around the world. In late 2019, NCIS went through additional organizational changes. In October, the Central Field Office was reactivated (having originally been deactivated at the end of 2015). As its name suggests, the Central Field Office is responsible for investigations and operations in the Central United States. In December, the position of deputy director was redesignated as the deputy director of operations, and the principal executive assistant director was redesignated as the deputy director of operational support.

==Organization==

===Organizational structure===
The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is headed by the director of NCIS who is directly responsible to the Secretary of the Navy for the operations of NCIS. The director is supervised by the Under Secretary of the Navy with the assistance of the General Counsel of the Navy and receives guidance from the NCIS Board of Directors, an advisory group chaired by the Under Secretary of the Navy that includes the General Counsel of the Navy, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the director of NCIS. The director directs and supervises the activities of NCIS exercises leadership through a strategic vision and exercises his/her direction through the deputy directors.

The NCIS currently has two deputy directors, the deputy director of operations, who is responsible for the day-to-day oversight and management of the operational directorates, and the deputy director of operational support, who is responsible for the day-to-day oversight and management of the support directorates.

The operational and support directorates are managed by an executive assistant director except some support directorates, which are managed by an assistant director. An assistant director is also assigned to some operational and support directorates to serve as the chief operations officer, responsible for assisting the EAD with the day-to-day oversight and management of the directorate.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service has worked on cases in collaboration with the United States Department of Justice, FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, the ATF, United States Secret Service and other agencies.

====Headquarters====

* NCIS Headquarters, Russell-Knox Building, Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.
** The Russell-Knox Building also houses the headquarters of the United States Army Criminal Investigation Division, Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency. Components of the Defense Intelligence Agency are also located at RKB.

The Russell-Knox Building (RKB), named after U.S. Marine Corps Major General John Henry Russell, Jr. and U.S. Navy Commodore Dudley Wright Knox, was built based on the findings of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The commission authorized the project to build the RKB as there was a need to co-locate the headquarters of the different criminal investigative agencies of the U.S. military.

Before the NCIS headquarters was moved to the Russell-Knox Building in 2011, it was located at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.

=====Office of the Director=====
The Office of the Director serves as the central administrative arm of the Director. The office encompasses the director, the deputy directors, and the director&#x27;s staff. The office is headed by the chief of staff who is accountable to the director, via the daily supervision of the deputy director of operational support, for the effective operation and administration of the office of the director.

Other components reporting directly to the director and/or deputy directors are:
* NCIS Inspector General
* NCIS Counsel, Office of the General Counsel of the Navy
* NCIS Comptroller

====Operational directorates====
The operational directorates of NCIS are supervised by the deputy director of operations who is the Chief Operations Officer of NCIS, responsible for criminal investigations, counterintelligence, counterterrorism, tri-service operations (Atlantic, Pacific, and Global), biometrics, technical surveillance countermeasures, behavioral science, technical services, Regional Enforcement Action Capabilities Team (REACT), polygraph services, and forensics.

The NCIS currently has two types of operational directorates: functional and field.

The functional directorates are the National Security Directorate and the Criminal Operations Directorate. These directorates are responsible for outlining the goals and objectives of NCIS relating to their functional area through the Program Direction Document. The executive assistant directors exercise direction and supervision of their Program Direction Document through the three field directorates. The EADs also advise the deputy director of operations on the three field directorate executive assistant directors&#x27; performance in meeting the outlined goals and objectives.

The field directorates are the Atlantic Operations Directorate, the Pacific Operations Directorate, and the Global Operations Directorate.

The geographic Atlantic Operations and Pacific Operations directorates are divided into field offices, each headed by a Special Agent in Charge (SAC), while the functional Global Operations Directorate is divided into field offices and field operational support elements, headed by Special Agents in Charge or division chiefs. The SAC/division chief is responsible for all operational, investigative, and administrative activities within their geographical/functional area of responsibility. They exercise leadership in the geographic implementation of NCIS&#x27; goals and objectives through the direction and supervision of Assistant Special Agents in Charge (ASAC) and Supervisory Special Agents (SSA). In field offices with only one ASAC, the ASAC is the Chief Operations Officer of the field office, responsible for the day-to-day oversight and management of its activities. In field offices with multiple ASACs, the ASACs serve as the heads of specific functions within the field office (e.g. ASAC of Criminal Investigations or ASAC of Atlantic Operations). The field office headquarters also has specialized teams, headed by Supervisory Special Agents, ready to support the field office&#x27;s subordinate units by dispatching experienced Special Agents and/or civilian investigators to assist in investigations if a prolonged investigation is required or the investigative resources required exceeds the subordinate unit&#x27;s capabilities. Usually, the senior-most Special Agent of the field team is designated as the Senior Field Agent who may also have some operational and/or administrative responsibilities.

The geographic field offices are divided into NCIS Resident Agencies (NCISRA) and NCIS Resident Units (NCISRU). NCISRA&#x27;s are headed by Supervisory Special Agents (designated as Resident Agents in Charge) who supervise all sworn Special Agents and civilian personnel assigned to the NCISRA. Depending on the size or location of the NCISRA, the Resident Agent in Charge may also supervise other Supervisory Special Agents who serve as team leaders, responsible for a specific investigative/operational function within the NCISRA (e.g. SSA of Counter-Terrorism). Some NCISRAs are further divided into NCISRUs, which are small units consisting of only one or two Special Agents (designated as Resident Agents) who report directly to the Resident Agent in Charge of the &quot;parent NCISRA.&quot; In NCISRU which is staffed by multiple Special Agents, the senior-most Special Agent is designated as the Senior Resident Agent and may also have some operational and/or administrative responsibilities. NCIS Special Agent Afloat duty posts are also classified as NCISRUs (e.g. NCISRU USS &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot;). NCISRUs afloat are under the functional supervision of the field office responsible for the vessel&#x27;s homeport but receive operational support from the field office responsible for the area where the ship is sailing in.

=====National Security Directorate=====
The National Security Directorate has program management oversight of counter-terrorism/counterintelligence investigations and operations, including espionage, terrorism, compromise, technology transfer, cyber intrusion, insider threats, and threats to research development and acquisition programs. The Directorate is also responsible for manning, training, and equipping agency personnel to protect Navy and Marine Corps forces, operations, information, facilities, equipment, and networks from attacks and the intelligence activities of foreign governments and international terrorist organizations.

The National Security Directorate is managed by an executive assistant director with the assistance of an assistant director. The directorate is divided into multiple programmatic departments which are headed by deputy assistant directors (comparable in practice to special agents in charge). The departments are further divided into divisions led by division chiefs (comparable in practice to assistant special agents in charge).

In 2015, the National Security Directorate comprised (at least) the following departments and divisions:

==Specialized programs==
===Special Agents Afloat===

The Special Agent Afloat Program of NCIS sends NCIS Special Agents aboard U.S. aircraft carriers, submarines, and other ships (for example, hospital ships and amphibious assault ships).
The purpose of the program is to provide professional investigative, counterintelligence, and force protection support to deployed Navy and Marine Corps commanders. These special agents are assigned to aircraft carriers and other deployed major combatants. Their environment can best be described as a &quot;floating city.&quot; The assignment offers many of the same investigative challenges found by any criminal investigator working in a metropolitan city. A special agent assigned to a carrier must be skilled in general criminal investigations including crime scene examination, expert interview techniques, and the use of proactive law enforcement procedures to stop criminal activity before it occurs. The special agent afloat also provides guidance on foreign counterintelligence matters, including terrorism. It is also the mission of the special agent afloat to offer Navy and Marine Corps leadership advice and operational support on security issues that might threaten the safety of ships, personnel, and resources.

The Special Agent Afloat (SAA) program was initiated in Europe in March 1967. In April 1971, a special agent was assigned to a deployed carrier for six months with the designation of SAA. By 1978, SAA personnel were assigned to each operational aircraft carrier in the U. S. Navy for a one-year assignment. In 1986, a trial began where two Special Agents Afloat were assigned to aircraft carriers to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of having two agents assigned full-time while deployed, one focusing on law enforcement/criminal investigations and one on foreign counterintelligence. The trial was discontinued when no longer considered viable.

===Protective operations===
The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is the only entity within the Department of the Navy authorized to conduct protection of the Department of Defense/Department of the Navy (DOD/DON) High-Risk Billets (HRB). The mission of the NCIS Protective Operations Field Office (POFO) is to prevent terrorist and/or criminal attacks on principals under NCIS executive protection coverage and execute the necessary and appropriate response to a threat and/or attack on a principal. POFO will also initiate investigations on individuals and groups who meet a specific threshold when a threat is detected or needs to be validated.

NCIS provides and manages full-time protection details on key Department of the Navy personnel, including:
* Secretary of the Navy
* Chief of Naval Operations
* Commandant of the Marine Corps

To supplement POFO&#x27;s operational mission, it maintains an internal Protective Intelligence Unit (PIU) to identify potential threats that could affect a principal, understand a principal&#x27;s level of vulnerability to any given threat, and use available intelligence to mitigate threats and/or risks to a principal. The Protective Intelligence Unit works extensively with the U.S. Secret Service, Pentagon Force Protection Agency, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and the U.S. Marshals Service.

===Multiple Threat Alert Center===

The Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC) utilizes NCIS&#x27; worldwide presence and combination of law enforcement, counterintelligence, intelligence and security capabilities to identify a wide range of threats to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and assets around the world. The MTAC is a unique platform in that it merges intelligence from other agencies with information from NCIS source networks and law enforcement activities worldwide to provide the most relevant operational support to the Navy and Marine Corps commanders.

===Regional Enforcement Action Capabilities Team===
In 2014, in the aftermath of the Washington Navy Yard shooting, NCIS formed the Regional Enforcement Action Capabilities Training (REACT) team. The team was renamed the Regional Enforcement Action Capabilities Team (REACT) around 2020. REACT teams are designed to support investigations and &quot;high-risk&quot; enforcement operations within the United States, including high-risk operations that involve the service of arrest and search warrants, undercover agent and source protection/rescue, undercover operations, high-risk surveillance, and high-risk protective assignments.

REACT is organized, equipped, directed, and controlled by the deputy assistant director of, the Criminal Investigations and Operations Department, Criminal Operations Directorate, and is under the direction of the REACT commander and deputy commander. Because of NCIS&#x27; changing needs and mobility, realignments of field offices, and geographical differences, the composition of each team may vary. In general, each REACT team is composed of one team leader (TL), one assistant team leader (ATL), and multiple tactical operators. Assignment to REACT is strictly voluntary and REACT is classified as a collateral duty, meaning Special Agents assigned to REACT remain in their original assignments within the field office when not called into service with REACT.

If REACT assistance is determined to be necessary, the field office SAC or his/her designee will contact the REACT commander, or deputy commander if the commander is unavailable, for further discussion and evaluation. The deputy assistant director of criminal investigations and operations maintains final approval authority for the use of REACT and the execution of a proposed operation.

===Major Case Response Team===

The Major Case Response Team (MCRT) is tasked with processing crime scenes and collecting evidence. They collect fingerprints and biological traces, impressions, and other evidence, as well as photograph the scene and make sketches of important details. There are 27 deployable MCRTs stationed around the world. They respond to death scenes and assist with the investigation of many other high-impact crimes, including sexual and/or aggravated assaults, acts of arson and wrongful destruction, and thefts. MCRT members also relieve the case agents (special agents assigned to lead investigations in the field) of crime scene responsibilities by conducting complex searches, attending autopsies, and performing other duties related to their areas of specialized training.

Even though all special agents possess the requisite skills for proper crime scene investigation after attending the mandatory Special Agent Basic Training Program, the MCRT was developed as a concept to lend a professional approach to crime scene processing. Special agents from all disciplines are trained in additional crime scene processing techniques and are called out on major incidents to search, locate, photograph, document, collect, and preserve physical evidence.

===Office of the Inspector General===
The NCIS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigates allegations of waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and misconduct by NCIS personnel. The OIG is headed by an Inspector General (IG) who serves at the pay grade of GS-15 or higher, and is appointed with the concurrence of the Naval Inspector General and reports directly to the Director of NCIS. The Inspector General also serves additional duties on the staff of the Naval Inspector General. The NCIS Inspector General is assisted by the NCIS Deputy Inspector General.

The IG directs the development of NCIS inspection, compliance oversight, and employee misconduct investigative priorities and performance requirements. They advise the Director and deputy directors on personnel and personnel-related decisions including, but not limited to: promotions, transfers, and awards nominations; issuance of non-police badges; and issuance of firearms authorization and firearms to non-agent personnel. The IG keeps the Director, deputy directors, and other NCIS executives informed on all matters about NCIS component performance evaluation, regulatory compliance, and personnel integrity.

* Internal Personnel Investigations — conducts official inquiries into allegations of personnel misconduct when the actions of special agents or other personnel involve breaches of NCIS policy or doctrine, violations of criminal law, or are of such nature to bring serious discredit on NCIS or the United States Navy.
* Inspections — the NCIS inspection program will primarily focus on the core functions of investigations, operations, and related support activities. The objectives of NCIS inspections are to: assess leadership, assess the quality of investigative and operational activity, assess the effectiveness and efficiency of NCIS components, assess staffing levels, assess the quality and management of available resources, assess compliance with established policies and procedures, evaluate anomalies which prevent or inhibit compliance to established policies and procedures, and develop appropriate recommendations to correct deficiencies.
* Field Office/Departmental Inspections — field office Special Agents in Charge and departmental Deputy Assistant Directors are responsible for mission accomplishment and monitoring the quality and timeliness of NCIS investigations and operations. Each field office component and headquarters department is required to conduct a self-inspection each year and report the results to the OIG. The Self-Inspection Program provides the Director the annual assurances that field operations comply with DoD, DON, and NCIS policies, directives, and regulations.
* Intelligence Oversight Program — assurance that all NCIS intelligence activities, operations, and programs function in compliance with applicable U.S. law, statute, directive, and policy to protect a person&#x27;s rights and privacy from intrusion by intelligence activities and agencies. Within each NCIS field office, the ASAC with responsibility for the Counterintelligence Program is designated as the Field Office Intelligence Oversight Officer. Within each NCISRA, the SSA is designated as the Unit Intelligence Oversight Officer. Intelligence Oversight Officers are responsible for ensuring required training is completed, answering employees&#x27; questions regarding authorized activities, and forwarding reports of questionable activity to the NCIS IG. A questionable intelligence activity may violate the law, any Executive Order, Presidential directive, or applicable DoD policy. Examples of questionable intelligence activity include, but are not limited to: alleged abuse and mistreatment of detainees and prisoners by or directed by intelligence personnel; tasking intelligence personnel to conduct intelligence activities that are not part of the organization&#x27;s approved mission, even if they have the technical capability to do so; providing intelligence services and/or products without proper authorization; and collecting information on U.S. persons, even though open source, when it is not part of the unit&#x27;s mission.

====Training====
New special agents must complete the Criminal Investigators Training Program (CITP) and the NCIS-specific Special Agent Basic Training Program (SABTP) at the NCIS Training Academy aboard the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC). The training provides instruction on the NCIS report writing system, manuals, and field training exercises. All newly hired agents who have not experienced active or reserve duty with the Navy or Marine Corps must also complete the Naval Orientation Correspondence Course. The Special Agent Career Program includes four investigative specialties (General Crimes, Fraud, Combating Terrorism, and Foreign Counterintelligence) and four technical specialties (Technical Services, Cyber, Forensics and Polygraph).

After completing the training programs, Special Agents enter the trial period, formerly referred to as a &quot;probationary&quot; period, which is (usually) the first two years of a Special Agent&#x27;s employment. The successful completion of the special agent trial period requires graduation from the CITP and SABTP and the successful completion of all phases included in the Special Agent Basic Training Program (SABTP). The phases are:
*Phase I – Pre-Basic Special Agent Orientation at the NCIS Field Office or Headquarters department before formal training at the FLETC.
*Phase II – Formal training at FLETC to include both the CITP and the SABTP.
*Phase III – On-the-job training.
*Phase IV – Final evaluation of casework and abilities. Upon completion of Phase III, an evaluation will be made on whether the Training Agent (TA) should remain in Phase III mode or move into Phase IV.

<text>The New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA; ) is the New Zealand government Crown entity tasked with administering educational assessment and qualifications. It was established by the Education Act 1989.

NZQA administers the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) and the New Zealand Scholarship for secondary school students. It is also responsible for the quality assurance of non-university, tertiary training providers, the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications, and the New Zealand Qualifications Framework. It has further roles in evaluating overseas qualifications.

In July 1990 it took over the work of the former Universities Entrance Board, the Ministry of Education&#x27;s examinations, the Trades Certification Board and the Authority for Advanced Vocational Awards.

NZQA is funded from the central government and third party revenue, and as of 2022 had an annual budget of approximately $80 million.

==Governance==
As of 2023, Grant Klinkum was the Chief Executive, supported by Alex Bidois, Utufa’asisili Rosemary Mose, Eve McMahon, Jann Marshall and Tim Bowron, and Tracey Martin was Chair of the NZQA Board.

==Māori strategy==
NZQA&#x27;s Māori strategy, Te Rautaki Māori 2012–2017, guides NZQA towards fulfilling its contribution to the government&#x27;s education sector goal of Māori enjoying and achieving education success as Māori. The strategy was launched in June 2012 with the two main goals of Accelerated Māori learner success and advanced use of mātauranga Māori.

NZQA has also produced two publications that support these goals – Enhancing Mātauranga Māori and Global Indigenous Knowledge (launched April 2014) and the earlier Conversations on Mātauranga Māori (launched July 2012).

==Review==
A Targeted Review of Qualifications (TRoQ) at levels 1–6 on New Zealand&#x27;s ten-level qualifications framework commenced in 2008. The review aimed to ensure that New Zealand qualifications are useful and relevant to current and future learners, employers and other stakeholders. NZQA administers the New Zealand Qualifications Framework (NZQF) which was established in July 2010 as a result of the Targeted Review and is a comprehensive, up-to-date list of all non-university quality assured qualifications in New Zealand.

Tertiary organisations are required to comply with statutory policies like the periodic external evaluation and review (EER) policy that provides an independent judgement of the educational performance and capability in self-assessment of all non-university tertiary education organisations. In 2011 NZQA introduced a new set of incentives and sanctions for providers, based on EER results, to bring higher performance to the sector.

In May 2014 NZQA introduced ‘Innovation at NZQA’ to its website detailing the organisation&#x27;s strategic thinking and ‘Future State’ programme of work around responding to a global and digital environment and trialling new processes and technologies.

==Numbers==
In 2013 more than 143,000 candidates took part in the annual NCEA and New Zealand Scholarship examinations administered by NZQA and achievement results were analysed in the Annual Report on NCEA and New Zealand Scholarship Data &amp; Statistics released each year by NZQA.

In 2016 more than 146,000 candidates sat NCEA and Scholarship exams. Because of the Kaikoura earthquake, the Scholarship exams were postponed. Students in the Hurunui and Kaikoura districts were unable to attend their exams as their schools were closed, meaning they had to use their derived grades.

==Controversies==
In 2005 the Authority&#x27;s Chairman and CEO resigned after an investigation by the State Services Commission into the 2004 New Zealand Scholarship exams. In the physics exams only 39 out of 1,012 students who sat the exam received a scholarship while in English the result was 228 out of 587. This, and the state of the Authority as a whole at that time, was described by media as a &quot;debacle&quot;.

==Concerns over exams==
In 2016, mistakes were made in the 2016 maths exam at every level.

In 2017, many students and teachers were left perplexed by NCEA Level 1 MCAT externals, stating that they were &quot;too difficult&quot; and &quot;not in the correct standard&quot;. NZQA stated that they had full confidence in their papers, but the minister has asked for a review.

<doc id="891818" wikidata="Q1752991" url="?curid=891818" title="Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca">
<text>Puerto Escondido (English: &quot;Hidden Port&quot;) is a Mexican city-port and tourist center in the municipality of San Pedro Mixtepec Distrito 22 in the state of Oaxaca. Prior to the 1930s, there was no town. The bay had been used as a port intermittently to ship coffee, but there was no permanent settlement due to the lack of potable water. The name &quot;Puerto Escondido&quot; had roots in the legend of a woman who escaped her captors and hid here. The Nahuatl word for this area was Zicatela, meaning “place of large thorns&quot;. Today, it refers to the area&#x27;s most famous beach.

Puerto Escondido is one of the most important tourist attractions on the Oaxacan coast. It caters to a more downscale and eclectic clientele than neighboring Huatulco, mostly surfers, backpackers and Mexican families. The main attractions are the beaches: Zicatela Beach hosts major surfing competitions, while other beaches have gentle waves. A large lagoon area to the west of the town is popular for fishing and birdwatching.

==History==
The area around Puerto Escondido had been inhabited by indigenous peoples for centuries, but no towns of any size were established during the pre-Hispanic or colonial eras. The bay was known as Bahia de la Escondida (Bay of the Hidden Woman) due to a legend associated with this place. The story states that a fierce pirate, Andrés Drake, brother of Sir Francis Drake, anchored his ship in the bay when the area was completely uninhabited, to rest for a few days unmolested by authorities.

Some weeks before, he and his crew kidnapped a young Mixtec woman from the village of Santa María Huatulco and took her prisoner. While in the bay, the woman escaped the cabin in which she was being held, and being a good swimmer, jumped overboard to get to shore and hide in the jungle just beyond the beach. Since then, the pirates referred to the woman as “La Escondida” (the hidden one) and every time the ship returned to these waters, the captain ordered his crew to search the area around the bay, however, they never found her. Hence, the area became known as the Bahía de la Escondida.

At the beginning of the 20th century, it was known as Punta Escondida (Hidden Point), then later, Puerto Escondido. At that time, it was just a small fishing village that intermittently was used to ship coffee. Back then, Puerto Escondido suffered from a lack of potable water, although the Colotepec River ran nearby. This caused people to settle in other places. Some did stay, including Nazario Castellanos and Escolástica Valencia, who were the night watchmen for the nearby coffee plantations and considered to be the town&#x27;s first residents. There was no real town until the 1930s, when Puerto Escondido&#x27;s activity as a port was more firmly established.

Puerto Escondido belonged to the municipality of Santa María Colotepec. However, eventually the residents petitioned to change jurisdiction to another nearby municipality, San Pedro Mixtepec, which was granted in the 1940s.

From the 1940s to the 1960s, a church was constructed and the first school was built. Wells were dug to alleviate the water supply problems, and generators bought to supply electricity to the pumps and the few streetlights. However, there were still problems getting needed outside supplies such as sugar. These commodities only arrived when a merchant ship entered the bay to sell its wares. Sometimes, this would not happen for months. Residents got by with local products such as fish, poultry, iguanas, chicken and turtle eggs. After the Sola de Vega road to the capital of Oaxaca was constructed, this problem was alleviated somewhat.

In the 1960s, Highway 200 was built, connecting Oaxacan coastal towns with Acapulco. Surfers and other tourists began to find the quiet beaches around Puerto Escondido and tourism began to flourish. Its function as a port diminished as coffee began to be transported by truck. Other infrastructure added included those to supply the area with potable water, a small airport where the Rinconada is now, mail service and some government offices. However, in the 1970s only about 400 people lived in Puerto Escondido.

With time, Puerto Escondido&#x27;s importance as a tourist attraction increased, with hotels and resorts being constructed. For many years, restaurants were almost exclusively in “palapas” (thatched roof shelters) with fishermen preparing their catches; however, these have mostly given way to modern tourist facilities. Puerto Escondido is one of the most important tourist sites on the Oaxacan coast.

The community of Puerto Escondido is divided between two municipalities. The Zicatela Beach side belongs to the municipality of Santa María Colotepec and the western portion belongs to San Pedro Mixtepec. The boundary between the two municipalities is in dispute, leaving many businesses in limbo, sometimes paying taxes to both municipalities.
. Puerto Escondido is lobbying for a more independent status with the Congress of the state of Oaxaca, against opposition from San Pedro Mixtepec. 69% of the municipality&#x27;s population lives in Puerto Escondido. In addition to the above problems, backers of the measure stated that while the community generates most of the municipality&#x27;s income, it does not receive support from the municipal seat. In August 2008, residents of Puerto Escondido blocked the highway to the municipal seat of San Pedro Mixtepec to protest the lack of money for infrastructure in the town. As of the 2009 census, Puerto Escondido had a population of 20,178

On 30 July 2009, the state congress declared Puerto Escondido to be a city. However, the declaration did not resolve the boundary dispute between San Pedro Mixtepec and Santa María Colotepec.

==The city==
Puerto Escondido is mostly located in the municipality of San Pedro Mixtepec in the western portion of Oaxaca&#x27;s coast also known as the Emerald Coast. Its bay is adjoined by a number of rocky cliffs, which vary in height between 15 and 30 metres. The town center is located on the north side of the bay. The climate is tropical and humid, with an average annual temperature of 28 °C (82 °F) with a rainy season in the summer.

Puerto Escondido is the oldest tourist attraction in the region, and is the main centre of tourist activity, both for nationals and foreigners. The large waves of Zicatela Beach make it a very popular surfing destinations. The port does continue to support commercial fishing activity, and it also attracts people for deep-sea fishing (esp. for sailfish).

Puerto Escondido is not as well-known or visited as other beach resort areas such as Acapulco or Cancun because there are only domestic flights, discouraging a number of visitors. Before the opening of the new highway in 2024, bus rides from the Oaxacan capital took seven hours over hairpin turns as the roads descend the Sierra del Sur mountain range. Most of the bus terminal coming from Oaxaca are located in the downtown.

Puerto Escondido is mostly downscale and rustic, with many small and mid-sized hotels and restaurants, but there are a few upscale hotels. Most cuisine is based on seafood and local plants, which include eleven species of banana, chocolate and coffee. It also has some Italian restaurants, which were opened by recent Italian immigrants.

The tourist center of Puerto Escondido is not a plaza but Pérez Gazga Avenue, known locally as &quot;El Adoquin&quot; or &quot;La Zona Adoquinada&quot; (the paving stone street). Beginning with a statue of Benito Juárez are found bars, hotels, cafes, restaurants, nightclubs, craft shops, Internet cafes, corner stores, tour operators and scuba diving rental. It also serves as a promenade as it parallels the main beach of the town, and is pedestrian-only after 17:00. At night it is crowded with locals and tourists. This is one of the areas to buy Mexican, especially Oaxacan, handcrafts such as loose-fitting blouses, shirts, vests, wraps, tapestries, handbags, bags, jackets, hammocks, carved stone jewelry, silver and seashell items. However, the main market in the town centre is where you get competitive Mexican prices. Away from the beach above the Adoquin is the Coastal Highway 200.

The Andador Escénico (Scenic Walkway) is a set of paths, stairs and bridges that begin at the main beach of the town and winds its way over rocky oceanside cliffs, passing below the lighthouse to a lookout the named Sueño Posible (Possible Dream). In some places the walkway is very near the ocean and gets wet from the waves.

Each year, the city celebrates Carnival which begins with the &quot;quema de mal humor&quot; or the burning of bad mood. This is done with an effigy with the purpose of ridding the people of bad thoughts and moods in order to enjoy the festivities.

==Education==

The Universidad del Mar has one of its campuses here.

==Beaches==
The main attractions of Puerto Escondido are its beaches, which have become internationally known. The area also is attractive to scuba divers because of the variety of fish, large oysters, lobsters and manta rays. Although the Pacific Coast of Mexico generally runs north–south, this section of the coast in Oaxaca runs east–west, Playa Zicatela is on the eastern end.

Puerto Escondido became famous for surfing competitions held at Zicatela Beach every year in November. The competition brings competitors from various countries. Nicknamed the &quot;Mexican Pipeline&quot; due to the similar power and shape of the Banzai Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu, the wave that breaks on Zicatela Beach draws an international crowd of surfers, bodyboarders and their entourages. Mid to late summer is low season for tourists, but a prime time for waves and international tournaments. A number of international competitions such as the ESPN X Games, and the MexPipe Challenge have taken place. This beach is separated from the other beaches by a rocky outcropping called &quot;El Morro&quot; (the nose). The beach is 50 to 100 metres wide and four kilometres long with large waves that reach up to sixteen metres high. Lifeguards are stationed at this high-risk beach as well as on the other beaches. About half of these are professional and the other half volunteers. Zicatela is still a surfers&#x27; beach, with the strong rip current making the area unsuitable for swimming. The Zicatela Beach tourist district caters to surfers, including specials on surfboard rentals. The beach now has a promenade, landscaped with flowers and shrubs along the restaurants, many recently established.

West of Zicatela over the El Moro rocky outcrop is Playa Marinero, which is the best beach for swimming as the surf and rip currents are much less. There is some surf, but gentle enough for beginning surfers and bodyboarding.

West from Playa Marinero is Playa Principal, or main beach, fronting the town proper. This beach has boats and water taxis are anchored close to shore. Here, fishermen arrive at dawn to sell their catch to local restaurants and families. It is 500 metres long with fine, gray sand and low to moderate surf. This is the primary place to hire boats which take tourists to otherwise inaccessible beaches, to see porpoises and marine turtles or for deep-sea fishing. This beach is also popular with Mexican families to picnic on and play soccer.

West of the Playa Principal is the lighthouse with a stone walkway, Andador Escénico, below it. From the end of the walkway, and a bit farther west, are the twin beaches of Puerto Angelito and Manzanillo, between which is a small rock outcropping. These are on a sheltered cove, making it safe for swimming, with Manzanillo having slightly more surf. Angelito Beach has small, family-owned restaurants located in palapas (open-air thatched structures). These beaches have water that varies in color from emerald green to turquoise blue. Puerto Angelito tends to be crowded and frequented by busloads of visitors. Playa Manzanillo is quieter as there is no road access.
West from these beaches is Playa Carrizalillo which has white sand and cobalt blue water edged in light green. This beach is on a small bay. There are no vehicular roads to this beach, and the footpath descends a steep slope on a recently installed rock stairway. It takes about fifteen minutes to walk to here from the town. A water taxi ride from Playa Principal is another option for accessing Carrizalillo. Waves are normally gentle, except for a zone that opens directly onto the ocean where waves are big enough for surfing. The difficult access means that the beach is not as crowded with walking vendors as the Puerto Angelito Beach. There are few restaurants and the area is generally cleaner. On the east and west sides of the bay are rocky outcroppings that serve as habitat for a wide variety of fish and coral, making it popular for snorkeling. Near Carrizalillo is the Rinconada, a former landing strip that is now lined with restaurants, salons, and shops. It also contains a lending library run by a local charity run by expatriates.

The westernmost beach is Playa Bacocho with upscale beach clubs. It has fine, soft sand, palm trees, warm, blue-green water and a moderate surf although the far west part of the beach can have a strong rip current. It faces southwest, offering good sunset views. West from Bacocho are still undeveloped beaches.

==Transportation==
Puerto Escondido International Airport has flights to the city of Oaxaca, Monterrey and Mexico City.

Commercial buses from the city of Oaxaca take about three to four hours.

A new three-lane superhighway (&quot;supercarretera&quot;) from Oaxaca has been constructed Ventanillas, Oaxaca, about 13 km east of Puerto Escondido, where it meets the old coastal Highway 200. The project, now more than a decade old, has been plagued by several delays. Its opened in 2024. This road reducesthe travel time from Oaxaca to around two and a half hours.

==Media==
There are an AM and FM radio station and Spanish language weekly newspapers. &quot;¡Viva Puerto!&quot; http://vivapuerto.com is the local, bilingual magazine.

==Fiestas de Noviembre==
The Fiestas de Noviembre (Festivals of November) are held during the month into the beginning of December. Events are scheduled in the San Pedro Mixtepec and Santa María Colotepec jurisdictions and there is little coordination between the events. This usually means a large number of events, with several held concurrently. Zicatela events are often staged on Playa Zicatela while the uptown events are often on Playa Principal or the municipal plaza west and above the main beach. Some of the major events include a motocross event, a sailfishing competition, a festival of coastal dance and a surfing tournament.

==Laguna de Manialtepec==
About 10 km west from Puerto Escondido is the Laguna de Manialtepec. There is a small village on the way called Bajos de Chila. as well as a small archeological zone of the Chatino culture. This site has a Sun Stone which represented the solar deity and a statue of a high-ranking priest. The lagoon is full of mangroves and many birds such as pelicans, seagulls, ibis, storks, cranes, jacanas, buzzards, kingfishers, swans and other species. Other wildlife here includes raccoons, weasels, deer, wild boar, foxes and crocodiles. A number of these are in danger due to poaching. In the middle of the lagoon is an island named Isla del Gallo, on which according to legend, a rooster can be heard singing every year on December 24.

<doc id="891820" wikidata="Q15037754" url="?curid=891820" title="Go-kart">
<text>A go-kart, also written as go-cart (often referred to as simply a kart), is a type of small sports car, close wheeled car, open-wheel car or quadracycle. Go-karts come in all shapes and forms, from non-motorised models to high-performance racing karts.
Karting is a type of racing in which a compact four-wheel unit called a go-kart is used. Art Ingels created the first go-kart in Los Angeles in 1956.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the term is unclear. One of the first appearances of the term is an 1885 painting by the Scottish artist Hugh Cameron&#x27;s &quot;The Go-Cart&quot;. It is also unclear why the &quot;C&quot; was later changed to a &quot;K&quot;. In the film &quot;The Ivory-Handled Gun&quot; (1935), the crippled father of Buck Jones refers to his wheelchair as a &quot;go cart&quot;. Charles Dickens also used &quot;go-cart&quot; in &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock and Other Stories&quot; when talking of his travel to Italy. In Genoa, he talks about &quot;a man without legs, on a little go-cat&quot;.

==Non-motorised==
Gravity racers are a popular form of non-motorised go-kart. These are karts which are propelled by gravity and are often simplistic, homemade and used for either recreational or competitive use. These are often referred to as soapbox cars in North America, however other regional variations such as billy carts (Australia) are common. 

Other forms of non-motorised go-karts (ie. quadracycles) may also be propelled by means such as bicycle pedals (such as in the form of a velomobile).

==Motorised==
=== Engines ===
Four-stroke engines can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about . Briggs &amp; Stratton, Tecumseh (company closed in 2008), Kohler, Robin, and Honda are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful two-stroke engines available from manufacturers like Yamaha, KTM, Biland, or Aixro (Wankel engine) offering from . They run at up to 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. PRD makes the PRD Fireball, a two-stroke engine delivering at 15,580 rpm.

Electric go-karts are available, requiring only that the batteries of the karts be plugged into an array of chargers after each run. Since they are pollution-free and emit no smoke, the racetracks can be indoors in controlled environments. Electric karts powered by lead-acid batteries can run a maximum of 20–30 minutes before the performance is affected, while those powered by lithium batteries may last up to 2 hours on a single charge. Some karts have been fitted with hydrogen fuel cells. High-performance electric go-karts for amusement parks and indoor tracks may have external electronic controls in the event of an accident or other hazards, in which the track attendant or the race referee can remotely slow down or stop all vehicles on the track via radio control. This external control can also be used to limit young riders to a slow operating speed, while a race consisting only of adults is permitted a higher speed. These controls can be applied to both electric and combustion-engine karts.

In some countries, go-karts can be licensed for use on public roads often referred to as street tracks. Typically there are some restrictions; in the European Union, a go-kart modified for use on the road must be outfitted with headlights (high/low beam), tail lights, a horn, indicators, and an engine not exceeding .

== Recreational, concession and indoor karts ==

Besides traditional kart racing, many commercial enterprises offer karts for rent, often called &quot;recreational&quot; or &quot;concession&quot; karts. The tracks can be indoor or outdoor. Karts are rented by sessions (usually from 10 to 30 minutes) or on a day basis. They use sturdy chassis complete with dedicated bodywork, providing driver safety. Most of these enterprises use an &quot;Arrive and Drive&quot; format which provides customers with all the safety gear (helmets, gloves and driver outfits) necessary, and allow them to show up anytime to race, without the problem of having to own their own equipment and gear.

Outdoor tracks can offer low-speed karts strictly for amusement (dedicated chassis equipped with low powered four-stroke engines or electric motors), or faster, more powerful karts, similar to a racing kart, powered by four-stroke engines up to and, more rarely, by 2-stroke engines, but designed to be more robust for rental use. Typically, outdoor tracks are also used for traditional kart races.

Indoor kart tracks can be found in many large cities in different parts of the world. These tracks are often located in refurbished factories or warehouses, and are typically shorter than traditional outdoor tracks. Indoor karts are usually powered by a four-stroke gasoline engine producing anywhere from , or sometimes by an electric motor. Many tracks offer competitive races and leagues. At the top level, an Indoor Karting World Championship (IKWC) exists.

There is a separate category of go karts in the powersports industry that includes off road go karts. These are similar to a miniature dune buggy. Off road go karts typically feature large tires, a full roll cage, heavy duty suspension, and features to protect the riders from wind and mud. There are no longer any American made offroad buggy brands due to legal issues, so all brands will come from China. 
Trailmaster is the leading off-road go kart brand with a wide range of models and features. Other brands of offroad go karts also come from China and include Coleman, Tao Tao, Kandi, and Hammerhead (previously built by Trailmaster).

<doc id="891821" wikidata="Q2466305" url="?curid=891821" title="Frank Glasgow Tinker">
<text>Frank Glasgow Tinker (July 14, 1909 – June 13, 1939) was an American volunteer fighter pilot for the &quot;Fuerzas Aéreas de la República Española&quot; (&quot;Air Forces of the Spanish Republic&quot;; FARE), during the Spanish Civil War.

Tinker was credited officially with shooting down eight enemy aircraft and was the highest-scoring American air ace of the war. However, Tinker&#x27;s logbook suggests that he claimed 19 victories, which would make him the sixth-highest scoring pilot in FARE. That relatively few of his claims were officially recognized was due to the complex system of verifying air kills used by FARE and the financial incentive paid to mercenaries: many victories were not verifiable because the downed aircraft crashed in an enemy-held area and/or an incentive would not have to be paid. In addition, Tinker and other pilots from &quot;Escuadrilla La Calle&quot; (&quot;La Calle&#x27;s Squadron&quot;), also known as &quot;1ª Escuadrilla de Chatos&quot; (1st &quot;Chato&quot; Squadron&quot;), shared a number of joint kills against Junkers Ju 52 bombers. He reported narrowly avoiding death at both the hands of enemy aviators and malfunctioning equipment.

He left a detailed record of his experiences as a fighter pilot for the Republicans in his memoir &quot;Some Still Live&quot;, published by Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co in New York, 1938 and recently republished by The Clapton Press, London.

==Early years==
Frank Tinker was born in Kaplan, Louisiana, and grew up in DeWitt, Arkansas. In 1926, he joined the US Navy hoping to gain an appointment to the US Naval Academy, which he did three years later. Graduating with the Class of &#x27;33, he did not receive a commission, along with the other lower half of the class, due to the Great Depression. He and other classmates then enrolled in the United States Army Air Corps, and received flight training at Randolph Field. In 1934, he received his naval commission, flight training at Pensacola, Florida, and assigned as a reconnaissance floatplane pilot on the USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; cruiser. Lasting only six months as an ensign in the navy, due to a brawl in Long Beach, and another in Honolulu, the navy dissolved his commission. Tinker then became a third mate on a Standard Oil tanker.

==Spanish Civil War==
After the start of the Spanish Civil War, Tinker offered his service to the Loyalist Government. Tinker disliked Benito Mussolini after Ethiopia, and Mussolini&#x27;s support of the Rebels. After signing a contract with the Spanish Embassy in Mexico City, he received a Spanish passport with the nom de guerre of Francisco Gómez Trejo. His contract included $1500 per month, and an additional $1000 for each enemy plane he downed. Tinker then traveled by train to New York City, boarded the SS &quot;Normandie&quot; for France, then traveled by train to Barcelona. At the San Xavier field in Los_Alcázares, he checked out as a combat pilot, joining Harold Edward Dahl, Albert Baumler, and other American pilots and English pilots at Manises Air Base.

From 7 January 1937, Tinker along with Dahl and Charlie Koch, joined three British and one Irish pilot in Walter Kantz&#x27;s 19 Bomber Squadron , flying Breguet 19 bombers. 

On 23 January, Tinker, Koch, Allison, Dahl, Leider. and 12 Spanish pilots, joined Andrés García La Calle&#x27;s Wright Cyclone powered Polikarpov I-15 squadron in Los Alcázares. On 10 February, now based at Guadalajara, they flew their first mission over enemy territory, each dropping four 24-pound bombs onto factories along the Jarama.

The squadron took part in the Battle of Guadalajara. On March 14, Tinker shot down his first aircraft, an Italian Fiat CR.32 fighter, followed by another CR.32 on March 20. On April 17, he shot down a German Heinkel He 51 fighter from Legion Condor over Teruel.

On May 3, 1937, Tinker and Baumler, the remaining American fighter pilots, were assigned to Ivan A. Lakeev&#x27;s squadron, and on 30 May, started flying the Polikarpov I-16.

On 2 and 16 June, he shot down two more CR.32s. On 12 July, he became the first American combat pilot to shoot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109. On 17 July, Tinker shot down another Bf 109A, and on 18 July, another CR.32. On 29 July, Tinker made his last flight in Spain.

While in Spain, Tinker socialized with Ernest Hemingway, Herbert Matthews, Martha Gellhorn, Henry Tilton Gorrell, and members of the Lincoln Brigade.

==Later years and death==
After Tinker&#x27;s return to the US, both the Army and Navy rejected his requested return to service. Instead, he wrote articles for various magazines and newspapers, including his &quot;Some Still Live&quot; series for the Saturday Evening Post. He was found in his Little Rock hotel room with a fatal gunshot wound to his head, an empty whiskey bottle, and an acceptance letter from the Flying Tigers. His tombstone included the epitaph &quot;¿Quién Sabe?&quot; (Who knows?).

Arkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted Tinker into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1999.

On July 11, 2009, the centennial of his birth, his niece and the Grand Prairie Historical Society, honored his memory in a DeWitt, Arkansas ceremony.

<text>These are tables of congressional delegations from Vermont to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives.

Vermont was the last state in the United States to include a woman in its congressional delegation, in 2023, when Becca Balint was sworn in as its only U.S. House member following her victory in the 2022 election. Despite its status as a heavily Democratic-majority state, it has only sent two Democratic United States senators to Congress in its entire history. Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch are the current senators from the state. At age 34, Patrick Leahy was the youngest U.S. senator in Vermont history, the first non-Republican senator from Vermont since 1856, and the first Democrat to represent Vermont in the chamber.

The current dean of the Vermont congressional delegation is Senator Bernie Sanders (I), having served in the Senate since 2007 and in Congress since 1991.

==United States Senate==


== U.S. House of Representatives ==
Current representative
&lt;section end=&quot;Current representatives&quot;/&gt;

Vermont used at-large seats, but restored the districts in 1821. Starting after the 1820 United States census, Vermont had five seats. Initially it used at-large seats, but starting in 1825 those seats were districted. All five representatives supported the Adams-Clay faction in the 1824 United States presidential election.

Starting after the 1840 United States census, Vermont had four seats. Starting after the 1850 United States census, Vermont had three seats. Starting after the 1880 United States census, Vermont had two seats. Since 1933, Vermont has had one at-large seat.

<doc id="891828" wikidata="Q1509894" url="?curid=891828" title="Matiu / Somes Island">
<text>Matiu / Somes Island is the largest of three islands in the northern half of Wellington Harbour, New Zealand. The island is 24.9 hectares (62 acres) in area, and lies 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) south of the suburb of Petone and the mouth of the Hutt River.

Matiu / Somes Island was used as a place of refuge by pre-colonial Māori. Middens and other remnants of habitation have been found on the island. There is also a long and varied European history. The island was used for human quarantine from 1840 until the 1920s. Ships arriving in Wellington Harbour with infectious passengers or crew would disembark them at Matiu / Somes Island for care and treatment before berthing in the city. During both World War I and World War II, &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, including long-term residents of New Zealand who originated from enemy countries, were interned on the island. Anti-aircraft gun emplacements were also built on the island during World War II and their remains can be seen today. The island was used for animal quarantine from 1864 until 1995. A maximum security animal quarantine station was built in 1968.

The island&#x27;s environment had become degraded during its long period of use for quarantine and defence purposes. However, in 1981 work began to restore the forest cover. Following more than 30 years of environmental restoration and the translocation of species, the island is now home to many native birds, invertebrates, reptiles and plants. Since 1995, Matiu / Somes Island has been designated as a scientific and historic reserve. For many years the public was banned from visiting the island due to its role as a human and animal quarantine station, but visitors are now welcome and may stay overnight on the island.

In 2009, ownership of the island was transferred to the Māori collective Taranaki Whānui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika, as part of the settlement of claims against the Crown for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. The island is managed by the Department of Conservation.

== Toponymy ==

Legend has it that Matiu and the nearby Mākaro island received their original Māori names from Kupe, the semi-legendary first navigator to reach New Zealand and return home with knowledge of the new land. He named them after his two daughters (or, in some versions of the tale, nieces) when he first entered the harbour around .

After European settlement, the island was known for over a century as Somes Island. In 1839 it fell under the control of the New Zealand Company along with much of the greater Wellington region. The island was renamed after Joseph Somes, the company&#x27;s deputy-governor and financier at the time. In 1997, after 10 months of investigation and consideration of submissions by the public, the New Zealand Geographic Board assigned the official bilingual name of &quot;Matiu/Somes Island&quot; in recognition of the island&#x27;s European and Māori histories. Ward Island was renamed as Mākaro/Ward Island at the same time. Since then the board has adopted the formatting convention of placing a space before and after the slash, so the official name is now written as &quot;Matiu / Somes Island&quot;.

== Geography ==
The island is in area, and lies south of the suburb of Petone and the mouth of the Hutt River. Just off the northern tip of Matiu / Somes Island lies tiny Mokopuna Island, also known as Leper Island. The much smaller Mākaro / Ward Island is about southeast of Matiu / Somes Island.

A distinct gully runs from the south of the former quarantine station and terminates at the sea on the southern end of the island between two largely forested ridges on either side to the east and west. The gully floor forms a swamp, but an ephemeral watercourse flows through it during periods of heavy rain. A 1942 map shows a small dam across the creek.

Despite being surrounded by sea water, Matiu / Somes Island has access to fresh water from the Waiwhetu artesian aquifer. Water from the Hutt River infiltrates into porous gravels in the vicinity of Taita Gorge, with between 3.8 and 5.7 million litres per hour flowing from the bed of the river into the underlying gravels between Taita Gorge and Melling. South of Melling, a layer of clay forms an impervious cap (or aquiclude) that holds the artesian water underground and causes it to build up pressure as it flows through the gravel layer southwards towards Wellington Harbour. The pressurised water can rise to the surface if the fresh water layer is penetrated with a bore hole. There are also artesian gravels beneath much of Wellington Harbour, in some places hundreds of metres deep, and they extend out to the present harbour entrance. The water level in the harbour was much lower 20,000 years ago, and the ancient Hutt River used to flow down a paleochannel to the east of the Matiu / Somes Island ridge as far as present-day Kilbirnie. The Waiwhetu aquifer flows under the sea bed from the direction of the Hutt River to the harbour mouth via the paleochannel. Matiu / Somes Island gets its fresh water from a bore sunk into the aquifer just offshore at the main wharf. In February 2016, the Department of Conservation temporarily restricted access to the island because a long dry summer had lowered the volume and pressure of water from the aquifer, requiring strict water conservation.

The island has three benches or platforms at 30, 45 and 75metres above the current mean sea level. The origin of these benches is uncertain. Similar levels are found on various ridges around the harbour, and the flat top of Makaro / Ward Island corresponds to the 30 metre level. They are likely to be interglacial wave cut benches that have been uplifted. No marine deposits have been found on the benches, but it is possible that they result from a combination of fluvial processes and tectonic uplift. If they were wave cut benches any marine deposits have been eroded away. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake raised Matiu / Somes Island by about 1.5metres. The perimeters of both Matiu / Somes and Mokopuna Island have shore platforms that were eroded by the sea prior to the 1855 earthquake. There are some remnants of an earlier platform at 2.4 to 3m above the present mean sea level. A rock arch and platform at the northern end of Matiu / Somes Island was formed by the action of the sea, but was raised above sea-level by successive earthquakes, including the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake. The arch now appears as a hole in the rock, above sea level.

Somes Rock is an underwater pinnacle off the southwest point of Matiu / Somes island.

==Climate==

== Geology ==

Matiu / Somes Island and the surrounding landscape of Wellington is dominated by grey sandstone and darker mudstone sequences, together commonly known as greywacke. In the harbour surrounding the island, the greywacke basement is overlain unconformably by solifluction debris and river gravels, then shelly marine silts, and finally artesian gravels that are capped with shelly marine silts.

Matiu / Somes Island is an uplifted block of greywacke, a horst structure thought to be part of a drowned ridge pushed up between faults that run northeast–southwest close to the west and east sides of the island. The faults extend from just offshore of Petone beach to about 1km south of the island. The greywacke at Matiu / Somes Island, and the surrounding Wellington landscape, is Late Triassic in age and assigned to the Rakaia Terrane, one of several terranes that collectively make up the Torlesse Composite Terrane (also known as the Torlesse Supergroup). A tube fossil (&quot;Torlessia mackayi&quot; ) has been found on the island. Although it has not been formally identified, it has been documented with an age range of 215-205Ma (Late Triassic). Tube fossils have also been found at other nearby locations such as Princess Bay and Sinclair Head, along the shore platform of Wellington&#x27;s south coast.

== History ==

=== Māori history ===
During the 18th century Ngāti Ira, an East Coast iwi, settled in Petone and around the eastern shores of the harbour. They built two pā on the island but there was no permanent settlement on the island due to limited resources there. Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama from Taranaki drove Ngāti Ira from their settlements in the 1820s.

In November 1835 Ngāti Mutunga people, affiliated to Te Āti Awa, seized the ship &quot;Lord Rodney&quot; at Wellington. The crew were tied up and the &quot;Lord Rodney&quot;&#x27;s captain John Harewood was forced or bribed to take a group of hundreds of Māori to the Chatham Islands. To ensure Harewood&#x27;s compliance, his chief mate was held hostage on Matiu / Somes Island. There was no Māori occupation on Matiu / Somes from about 1840.

==== Archaeological sites ====
At the northern end of the island on a site with steep cliffs there was the Te Moana–a–kura pā which contained terraces and middens. Haowhenua pā was built in the middle of the island, where the quarantine station was sited, but the only remaining sign of occupation is a midden. The midden, which was underneath the hospital building, was uncovered and excavated during building work in 1999. Faunal remains included shellfish (species from the mainland), fish and bird bones.

=== European history ===

At various times throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the island hosted quarantine facilities for both human immigrants and animals, and enemy alien internees during wartime.

==== Human quarantine ====
In 1868 the island was declared a quarantine ground and used to isolate passengers from a ship carrying smallpox. When the immigrant ship &quot;England&quot; arrived in 1872 carrying several passengers with smallpox, passengers and crew were quartered in makeshift accommodation on the island. On other occasions, new arrivals would spend ten minutes in a smokehouse of chlorine, potassium nitrate and sulphur fumes for de-lousing. During the influenza pandemic of 1918–1920, a few people were quarantined on Matiu / Somes Island, but there was general agreement that the facilities were completely inadequate. The government then built accommodation for hundreds more people. In 1920, some passengers and crew from the ship &quot;Mahana&quot; were quarantined on Matiu / Somes Island with scarlet fever, but the quarantine station fell out of use after this. In 1935 the Government announced that it would reduce the number of quarantine beds on the island from 600 to about 50, but the Ministry of Health continued to restrict access to the island. In 1946, after World War II had ended, the island was offered back to the Ministry of Health but it declined to retake control.

Forty-five people are known to be buried on the island, mostly immigrants who arrived in the 1870s. In 1971, individual gravestones were removed from the overgrown cemetery and replaced with a large memorial. In January 2000, four of the old headstones were retrieved from storage and placed next to the communal memorial.

==== Animal quarantine ====
Use of the island as an animal quarantine facility is recorded as early as 1864, when an advertisement in the &quot;Wellington Independent&quot; recorded that a man named James Sellars had been permitted to use it as a quarantine ground for his sheep. In 1889 Matiu / Somes Island was declared as the first animal quarantine station in New Zealand. In 1892 the government established a Department of Agriculture to protect New Zealand&#x27;s farming industry, and in 1893 passed the Stock Act. The Stock Act 1893 gave the Department of Agriculture power to quarantine all live animals arriving in the country, so it built permanent animal quarantine facilities on Matiu / Somes Island (in 1893) and at other locations for this purpose. In 1916, internees on the island built stables for the quarantine station.

In 1968 the government built a maximum security animal quarantine station. It had laboratories, animal pens and other facilities for quarantining up to 35 cattle and 150 sheep, and there were associated new homes for the workers and their families. Other animals quarantined included goats, alpacas, llamas and deer. The quarantine station was officially opened in December 1970. It closed in 1995 after in-vitro fertilisation technology was developed, making importation and quarantining of live breeding stock unnecessary.

==== World War I internment camp ====

During World War I the island continued to be used for quarantining animals but was also used for an internment camp which imprisoned about 300 &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. Prisoners during this time included many German prisoners of war and suspected Danish imposter Hjelmar von Danneville. Other &quot;enemy aliens&quot; included German residents of New Zealand who were considered dangerous or who were reservists in the German or Austrian armies, sailors who had been at sea when war broke out, and Germans from Samoa. A 12-man Bavarian Band who had been touring New Zealand in 1914 were interned on the island for five years; there they entertained other internees. 

In March 1915 two prisoners escaped from the island by swimming to Petone, where they turned themselves in at a police station, seeking to alert the authorities to allegedly poor treatment of internees. In July 1918 four men escaped on a raft made of wood with oil drums for buoyancy, landing at Ngauranga; one of the men died of exposure on the beach and the others were recaptured after seeking help. 

An inquiry was held towards the end of the war into numerous accusations of mistreatment of alien internees on the island. Although in general the inquiry report found an absence of evidence to support charges of ill-treatment, it did make some recommendations to improve conditions for internees, and noted the use of &quot;disrespectful language&quot; by the camp overseer.

After the war ended, the internees were transferred to Featherston military camp and from there 260 of them were deported back to Germany. In 1919 the Bavarian Band returned to Europe on the steamship &quot;Willochra.&quot; The island reverted to use as a human quarantine station.

==== World War II internment camp ====
On 29 August 1939 Matiu / Somes Island was handed over from the Health Department to the Army and again shifted from quarantine station to internment camp, with the first group of internees arriving in late December 1939. Internees included German and Italian residents of New Zealand and men from Pacific Islands plantations. By January 1942 there were also 45 Japanese internees who were New Zealand residents and fishermen from Suva. Tensions developed amongst the various national groups, in particular between German Nazis and German Jews. As in World War I, there were allegations of ill-treatment of the men on the island. Three men escaped in November 1941 in a boat stolen from the island&#x27;s caretaker and made it to the Akatarawa hills before hunger forced them out to buy food and they were rearrested.

In 1942, the island was fortified with heavy anti-aircraft gun emplacements on the summit, but they were never used. A large area was levelled for this construction, with the result that was removed from the island&#x27;s previous overall height. A degaussing station was built to provide protection for ships against magnetic mines. Many of the physical features of these sites are present on the island today. The Swiss Consul protested that with military equipment on the island it had become a potential target, and that keeping prisoners in a potential conflict zone was against the Geneva Convention. The Government moved the internees to a camp at Pahiatua, but in September 1944 this was needed for Polish refugee children so the prisoners were sent back to Matiu / Somes Island (apart from the Italians who had been allowed to return to their families after Italy signed an armistice in March 1944). At the end of the war the remaining internees were released and some were permitted to stay in New Zealand if they wished. In 1995, Club Garibaldi, a Wellington social club for people of Italian origin, erected a monument listing 38 Italians who had been interned on the island during the war.

==== Quarantine station to scientific reserve ====
From 1947 to 1995 the island was used as a quarantine station for livestock, with limited access to the public from 1981 onwards. In December 1983, the island was still a maximum security animal quarantine station. However, over the 1983/84 summer period, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries agreed to allow day visits to the island by members of the public, limited to 120 visitors per open day. The visits were by permit only, and access to the quarantine station was not allowed. The day visits were co-ordinated by the Wellington Regional Council.

Matiu / Somes Island came under the jurisdiction of the newly-formed Lower Hutt City Council in 1989 and came under the full control of the Department of Conservation (DOC) as a scientific and historic reserve in August 1995.

=== Transfer of ownership ===

In 2009, ownership of the island was transferred to the Māori collective Taranaki Whānui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika. The transfer of ownership was part of cultural redress for Taranaki Whānui included in the settlement of their claims against the Crown for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. Following the passing of the Port Nicholson Block (Taranaki Whānui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika) Claims Settlement Act 2009, the island is owned by the trustees of the Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust. A kaitiaki (management) plan was prepared in 2012, to guide the administration of the island&#x27;s scientific and historic reserves in accordance with the Reserves Act 1977. A small team of rangers lives on the island to maintain facilities, manage visitors and volunteers, and monitor bait stations. 

A (carved gateway) named was unveiled next to the wharf at the entrance to the island in 2017.

== Environmental restoration ==

=== Revegetation ===
In 1872, the island had few trees or shrubs. Sheep were grazed and quarantined on the island from 1851 onwards. During its time as a farm and quarantine station, much of Matiu / Somes Island was converted to pasture. The effects of grazing over a period of 125 years meant that by 1976 the island was mostly bare, with the exception of some exotic trees, including macrocarpa that had been planted for shelter. Native wildlife on the island was severely affected by the loss of habitat. In 1977, the Ministry of Works presented a landscaping plan to the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The purpose of the plan was to provide screening and shelter of the accommodation and other buildings on the island, and to screen the oxidation ponds and rubbish dump. The plan proposed planting of a variety of native plants, along with more macrocarpa. A small number of trees were planted in 1977–78. 

At about the same time, members of the Lower Hutt branch of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society became interested in revegetation of the island. They gained agreement to begin planting native plants on the island in the early 1980s. Access to the island was still strictly controlled at that time, because it was still a high security animal quarantine station. Over the period 1981–2008, the volunteers planted over 100,000 plants. 

Species introduced or reintroduced to Matiu / Somes Island include Cook&#x27;s scurvy grass, northern rātā&quot;,&quot; large-leaved milk tree&quot;,&quot; taupata, hebes, ngaio, and five finger&quot;.&quot; A volunteer group known as the Karo Busters spent ten years poisoning karo trees growing on the island, since this species does not occur naturally in the area. Many of these projects have been supported by the community and the local Māori collective, Taranaki Whānui ki te Upoko o te Ika.

=== Pest eradication ===
Rats and mice were successfully eradicated between 1988 and 1989. In 1990, it was the largest island that had been cleared of ship rats. There was a suspected intrusion by a mouse in 2012, but no further evidence was found. The Department of Conservation maintains a network of traps and tracking tunnels. 

=== Reintroduction of birds ===

Red-crowned kākāriki (parakeets) from Kapiti Island were successfully re-introduced in 2003 and 2004, and remain a common sight on the island. North Island robins sourced from Kapiti Island were released in April 2006. They bred for the first time in late September that year and this appeared to indicate that the island ecosystem was a suitable habitat for this species. However, the robins did not thrive, possibly because the regenerating forest does not yet provide sufficient damp leaf litter year-round to sustain an adequate population of invertebrates as food.

Little blue penguins breed on the island, and the population is closely monitored. Their numbers have increased significantly since the revegetation of the island. To help support penguin breeding, over 170 artificial nest boxes have been provided. However, in the 2020/21 season, there was high mortality of penguin chicks, attributed to starvation caused by warmer sea temperatures making it more difficult for adults to find and catch fish. Normal chick mortality is around 11% but the figure for 2020/21 was 35%.

Between 2012 and 2014, 237 fluttering shearwater chicks were translocated from the Marlborough Sounds to Matiu / Somes Island and hand-fed until they fledged. Some of the now-adult birds have since returned to the island and begun to breed. A solar-powered speaker system was installed to transmit fluttering shearwater calls each night, and has attracted wild birds to Matiu / Somes Island. This species is common in Wellington Harbour but there has been no local breeding population since pre-European times. They were once an important food source for local iwi.

The island is also a stronghold for other seabirds including the spotted shag and black shag, and the red-billed gull.

=== Reintroduction of invertebrates ===
There are more than 500 species of invertebrates on the island, including three species of wētā. Wellington tree wētā were transferred to Matiu / Somes Island in 1996 and 1997, and 67 Cook Strait giant wētā were successfully transferred from Mana Island in 1996. A species of small ground wētā had survived on Matiu / Somes Island after deforestation.

=== Reintroduction of reptiles ===
The island is now home to several species of native reptiles, including the common skink, spotted skink, copper skink and common gecko. Twenty-five forest geckos were transferred to the island in April 2005, and more than 90 Wellington green geckos were released in several transfers between 2006 and 2013. Two of these geckos were fitted with transmitters so that they could be monitored after release. In 2015 the green geckos were confirmed to be breeding on the island. Tuatara are known to have been living on Matiu / Somes island in the 1840s but later died out. In 1998, around 50 Brothers Island tuatara were released on Matiu / Somes Island, and by 2007 some had begun breeding there.

=== Matiu / Somes Island Charitable Trust ===
The Matiu / Somes Island Charitable Trust was established in 1999 and launched in March 2000 as a partnership between local iwi and the general community to help protect, nurture and enhance the island by raising funds for projects that increase biodiversity and enhance visitors&#x27; enjoyment of the island. Through its active arm, &quot;The Friends of Matiu / Somes&quot;, it encourages community participation in work on the island. It also works closely with DOC and community groups such as Forest &amp; Bird. 

=== Maintaining biosecurity ===
Visitors to the island are required to pass through the &quot;whare kiore&quot; (&#x27;rat house&#x27;) building at the wharf at the northeast of the island after disembarking, to check their bags for pest animals, plants, seeds and soil.

== Transport ==
Scheduled ferry services from the Wellington CBD to Matiu / Somes Island and Days Bay operate as part of ferries in Wellington, landing at the main wharf at the northeast of the island. An electric ferry was introduced in 2022. Visitors arriving in private boats may only land at the main wharf or nearby beach.

In January 2024, the Kaitiaki Board governing the island announced that public access to the island would be closed for 6–8 months while the wharf was rebuilt.

== Tourism ==
Matiu / Somes Island is an increasingly popular tourist attraction and educational resource for local schools, with about 15,000 visitors per year. Visitors may stay overnight on the island in one of two houses managed by the Department of Conservation (Education House built in the 1970s or the historic caretakers&#x27; cottage), or in a tent at one of 12 campsites.

Just to the north lies a much smaller island, Mokopuna Island. To protect endemic wildlife on Mokopuna Island – particularly nesting seabirds – landing by members of the public is prohibited.

==Lighthouse==
The Matiu / Somes Island lighthouse is a harbour navigation light for Wellington Harbour. It is a sector light, marking a safe approach through the harbour channel. The first lighthouse on the site was established in 1866. It was the first inner harbour lighthouse in New Zealand, and one of only eight lighthouses nationwide at that time. However, by 1895 there were multiple complaints that it was inadequate. A replacement lighthouse with a more powerful light was built on an adjacent site and commissioned on 21 February 1900. The light was automated on 1 April 1924 and converted to electricity after 1945. The lighthouse is owned and operated by the Greater Wellington Regional Council.

==In the arts==
Award-winning New Zealand novelist Maurice Gee&#x27;s novel &quot;Live Bodies&quot; was set in part on Matiu / Somes Island, with the main character spending time interned there during the Second World War.

Oscar Kightley is a Samoan-born New Zealand actor, television presenter, writer, journalist, director, and comedian. In 1998, he co-wrote and performed in a play, &quot;Eulogy,&quot; that was based on the story of Samoan and German prisoners interned on the island during the Second World War.

New Zealand author of children&#x27;s fiction Melanie Drewery&#x27;s picture book for children, &quot;Papa&#x27;s Island,&quot; tells the story of a family caught up in the internment of &quot;enemy aliens&quot; on Matiu / Somes Island.

New Zealand author of fiction and non-fiction David McGill&#x27;s spy novel &quot;The Death Ray Debacle&quot; is based on a true story about Victor Penny, an Auckland bus garage attendant and amateur radio enthusiast who in 1935 managed to convince government authorities that he could produce a &#x27;death ray&#x27; that was capable of stopping an army, immobilising trucks, and bringing down enemy aeroplanes in flight. Penny was placed under the protection of defence authorities initially on Matiu / Somes Island and later at Fort Dorset, a military coastal defence battery in Seatoun.

In 2013 Wellington theatre company Bard Productions staged an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; on Matiu / Somes Island, with the boat journey across to the island forming part of the play. Scenes took place at the former animal quarantine station and in the open air.
