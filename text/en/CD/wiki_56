<text>The Battle of Stiklestad (; ) in 1030 is one of the most famous battles in the history of Norway. In this battle, King Olaf II of Norway () was killed. During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church declared Olaf a saint in 1164.

His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada (), was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, until his death in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066.

==Background==
During the 9th century, Norway was divided between several local kings controlling their own fiefs. By the end of the century, King Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: ) managed, mainly due to the military superiority gained by his marriage alliance with Hákon Grjótgarðsson of Nidaros, to subjugate these mini–kingdoms, and he created a unified Norwegian state.

This alliance came apart after Harald&#x27;s death. The jarls of Lade and various descendants of Harald Fairhair would spend the next century interlocked in feuds over power. As well as power politics, religion also played a part in these conflicts, as two of the descendants of Harald Fairhair, Haakon the Good and Olaf Tryggvason attempted to convert the then heathen Norwegians to Christianity. In the year 1000, Sveinn Hákonarson and Eiríkr Hákonarson of Lade took control over Norway, being supported by the Danish King Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: ). In 1015, Olaf Haraldsson, representing the descendants of Harald Fairhair, returned from one of his Viking trips and was immediately elected as King of Norway. In June 1016, he won the Battle of Nesjar against the jarls of Lade.

Olav Haraldsson&#x27;s success in becoming King of Norway was helped by the Danes being kept occupied with the ongoing fighting in England. In the year 1028, the Danish king Cnut the Great made an alliance with the Lades, and Olaf had to go into exile in Kievan Rus&#x27; (Old Norse: ). In the year of 1029 the last Lade jarl, Haakon Sigurdsson (Old Norse: ), drowned, and Olaf prepared a military expedition to reclaim the throne. Olaf was supported by the Swedish king Anund Jacob who wanted to weaken Cnut&#x27;s power and provided Olaf with 400 men and guides that could lead Olaf through Dalarna into Norway.

==Battle==
According to saga sources, Olaf traveled with his 3,600 man army through Sweden and crossed the mountains into the valley of Verdalen (Old Norse: ), about north of the city of Trondheim. Olaf and his men arrived at Stiklestad, a farm in the lower part of the valley. This was where the Battle of Stiklestad took place, as described by Snorri Sturluson in his famous work , written about 200 years later.

At Stiklestad, Olaf met an army led by Hárek of Tjøtta (Old Norse: ), Thorir Hund from Bjarkøy and Kálfr Árnason, a man who previously served Olaf. The farmer army consisted of one hundred hundred according to Snorri, which in long hundreds means 14,400, and not 10,000. He states that the battle cry of Olaf&#x27;s men was (Forward! Forward! Men of Christ, men of the cross, men of the king!), while that of the opposing army was (Forward! Forward! Farmers!).
According to Snorri, Olaf received three severe woundsin the knee, in the neck, and while leaning against a large stone the final mortal spear thrust up under his mail shirt and into his belly. According to saga sources, Thorir was among those who gave Olaf his lethal wounds, together with Kálfr Árnason and Torstein Knarresmed from Rovde in Sunnmøre. While earlier sources do not specify who dealt the king his blows, Snorri makes Thorir Hund responsible for the latter, using the spear that had killed his nephew and set the fallout between the king and Thorir in motion. During the Battle of Stiklestad, King Olaf almost killed Thorir Hund with a war hammer. However, Torstein Knarresmed managed to get between them and gave Olaf a wound right above his left knee. Shortly later Thorir Hund thrust his spear into the king&#x27;s stomach before Kálfr Árnason struck the king in the throat with his sword. Torstein Knarresmed was subsequently killed by a blow in the back but was revenged later that same day by one of Thorir&#x27;s men.
 The king&#x27;s body was carried away and buried secretly in the sandy banks of the Nidelva River south of the city of Trondheim.

==Aftermath==

The year after the battle, his grave and coffin were opened and according to Snorri the body was incorrupt and the hair and nails had grown since he was buried. The coffin was then moved to St. Clement&#x27;s Church in Trondheim.
Among the bishops that Olaf had brought with him from England, was Grimketel and it was he that initiated the beatification of Olaf on 3 August. Stiklestad Church () was erected on top of the stone against which St Olaf died. The stone is supposedly still inside the altar of the church.

One hundred years later, Nidaros Cathedral was built in Trondheim on the site of his original burial place. Olaf&#x27;s body was moved to this church and enshrined in a silver reliquary behind the high altar. This reliquary took the form of a miniature church, common to medieval reliquaries containing the entire body of a saint, but was unique in that it is said to have had dragon heads at the apex of the gables similar to those still seen on Norwegian stave churches. In the 16th century, during the Protestant Reformation period, Olaf&#x27;s body was removed from this reliquary, which was melted down for coinage by order of the Dano-Norwegian king. His remains were reburied somewhere in Nidaros Cathedralexactly where is still today an unsolved mystery. Queen Josephine of Leuchtenberg of Norway and Sweden, the consort of Oscar I, asked for the one known remaining relic of St. Olaf, an ulna or radius in a medieval reliquary in the Danish National Museum, from King Frederik VII of Denmark, which he gave to her and which she in turn gave to St. Olaf&#x27;s Cathedral in Oslo in August 1862.
==Evaluation==

While Snorri&#x27;s description of the battles in the makes for epic reading, its grandeur most likely must be put down to the writer&#x27;s taste for the grand.

In Gardarike, Olaf was only surrounded by his most loyal followers. Neither can one expect that recruitment was especially ample in Sweden or through the sparsely-populated valleys through which Olaf travelled. Thus, Olaf&#x27;s army was probably of a rather rag-tag character, an impression accentuated by tales of how local robber groups would join it as Olaf made his way down the Verdalen valley. The recruitment of robber gangs and other scofflaws was likely no surprise to the polytheistic heathens that opposed Olaf&#x27;s attempts to forcibly convert them by murdering and torturing regional Jarls and Kings to terrorize them into accepting Christianity. reports that Anund Jacob could not raise support of an invasion of Norway among the Swedes and could only provide Olaf with a smaller force made out of his personal soldiers.

In fact, why Olaf chose to travel through the politically-hostile Trøndelag, rather than to try to rally his relatives and political allies of Eastern Norway, is to this day an unsolved mystery. Perhaps he was making a last-ditch attempt for Nidaros, hoping to win acceptance for his claim to the throne amongst the farmers of Trøndelag.

On the other hand, the oppositionbasically lower nobles and grand farmers under the influence of King Cnutcould not have had much time to assemble a large force. When alerted to Olaf&#x27;s presence, they must have responded swiftly, considering that they met Olaf relatively far up the valley. Therefore, their action points more toward a small, hastily-arranged rally of men rather than the elaborate logistics that would have been needed to assemble a 10,000-man-strong army.

Those who could have mobilized a large-scale army, the local nobles of Trøndelag (of which Einar Thambarskelfir was a prime example) were notable largely by their absence on either side. Also, the battlefield of a hotly-contested battle between nearly 20,000 men should have produced rich archeological findings to that effect; at Stiklestad however, these are sparse, though this is common in Norway. The rocky soil is not as well-suited to battlefield archaeology as continental or English soil. It makes georadar readings all but unusable, and the location of the battle site highly uncertain. On Stiklestad, the soil is deep soil with some clay, and georadar was used in 2008, showing traces of large buildings, but not much to indicate a battlefield. As is the case with most battles mentioned in the sagas, the sizes of the battling armies are probably impossible to determine.

Olaf&#x27;s role in Norwegian history had only just begun at his death. While nobles and rich farmers had expected their position to improve with the removal of the aggressive Olaf, the opposite happened. The rule of Cnut&#x27;s mistress and their infant son Svein was exceedingly harsh on the people. The church especiallya traditional ally of Olafcame under greater pressure.

Thus, the late King&#x27;s martyr status was accentuated, helping to incite common folk into revolting against the hardships enforced by the succeeding Danish rule. Propaganda proclaiming the heroic nature of Olaf&#x27;s last stand made for great nation-building material in the immature Norwegian state, where the warrior ethic of the Vikings and their gods and goddesses were still highly revered. According to Snorri, even nature lent a hand, as the day of the battle coincided with a nearly-full solar eclipse, as reflected in the description of an ill-fated &#x27;blooded red sun&#x27;, which was interpreted as a certain omen of bad things to come. However, the solar eclipse took place at about 2:00 p.m. on August 31 that year contrary to the traditional date of the battle on July 29.

Olaf was a rather stubborn and rash ruler. Modern historians generally agree that Olaf was inclined to violence and brutality. Ironically, he became Norway&#x27;s patron saint. His canonization was performed only a year after his death by the bishop of Nidaros. The cult of Olaf not only unified the country, it also fulfilled the conversion of the nation, something for which the king had fought so hard.

While divisive in life, in death Olaf becamethe eternal king of Norway, wielded a unifying power no foreign monarch could hope to undo. Cnut, most distracted by the task of administering England, managed to rule Norway for five years after the battle through his viceroy son Svein. However, when Olaf&#x27;s illegitimate son Magnus (dubbed &#x27;the Good&#x27;) laid claim to the Norwegian throne, Cnut had to yield. Thus, a century of prosperity and expansion followed, lasting until the kingdom again descended into the Civil war era in Norway over the issue of succession.&#x27;

==Legacy==
Stiklestad National Cultural Center () at Verdal was established by a parliamentary resolution in 1995. is a monument in the Stiklestad National Cultural Center. It was erected in 1807 in memory of the Battle of Stiklestad. The memorial is one of the oldest preserved public monuments in Norway.
In 1901, poet Per Sivle wrote a poem , about King Olaf&#x27;s standard-bearer at the battle. Foleson was able to plant the banner before he died, and it remained standing throughout the battle, even after the king fell. It was kept erect and replaced by the local populace for centuries, and a memorial stands at the site today. The most famous line of the poem, (&#x27;The symbol stands, even when the man falls&#x27;), is inscribed on the memorial in Stalheim, Norway. It is also on the inscription wall in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp memorial site.
&quot;The Saint Olav Drama&quot; () is an outdoor theatre performance played every end of July in Stiklestad. In July 1954, the owner of the farm at Stiklestad gave permission for the performance of a play based on the battle on his property. The play was written by Olav Gullvåg and has been staged every year since 1954. Annually, people travel to Stiklestad to watch &quot;The Saint Olaf Drama&quot; at what is now the largest outdoor theatre in Scandinavia.

<doc id="890424" wikidata="Q93583" url="?curid=890424" title="Gustav Wagner">
<text>Gustav Franz Wagner (18 July 1911 – 3 October 1980) was an Austrian member of the &quot;SS&quot; with the rank of Staff sergeant (&quot;Oberscharführer&quot;). Wagner was a deputy commander of Sobibor extermination camp in German-occupied Poland, where 200,000-250,000 Jews were murdered in the camp&#x27;s gas chambers during Operation Reinhard. Due to his brutality, he was known as &quot;The Beast&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot;.

==Biography==
Wagner was born in Vienna, Austria. He served as a soldier in the Austrian army from 1928 and joined the then illegal Nazi Party in 1931 as member number 443,217. After being arrested for proscribed National Socialist agitation, he fled to Germany, where he joined the SA and later the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; in the late 1930s, serving as a guard at an unknown concentration camp.

In May 1940, Wagner was part of the Aktion T4 euthanasia program at Hartheim killing centre with administrative functions and cremating the bodies of murdered patients. Due to his experience in T4, Wagner was assigned to help establish the Sobibor extermination camp in March 1942 and oversaw the construction of the camp. Once the gassing installation, barracks, and fences were completed, Wagner became deputy commandant of the camp under Commandant Franz Stangl. His official title was quartermaster-sergeant of the camp.

Wagner was in charge of selecting which prisoners from the newly arrived transports would be used as slave laborers in and outside the camp, from among the newly arrived ghetto inhabitants. When Wagner was on vacation or attending to duties elsewhere, Karl Frenzel assumed his role within the camp.

More than any other officer at Sobibor, Wagner was responsible for the daily interactions with prisoners. Survivors of the camp described him as a cold-blooded sadist. Wagner was known to beat and thrash camp inmates on a regular basis, and to kill Jews without reason or restraint. Inmate Moshe Bahir described him:
Erich Bauer later remarked:
Also according to Bauer, Wagner participated in gang rapes of female prisoners prior to killing them:
Inmate Eda Lichtman wrote that on the Jewish fast day of Yom Kippur, Wagner appeared at roll call, selected some prisoners, gave them bread and forced them to eat it. As the prisoners ate the bread, Wagner laughed loudly, enjoying his joke because he knew that these Jews were pious.

One of the Sobibor prisoners improvised a song which ironically described camp life (original text with English translation):

Wagner enjoyed this song and he forced the prisoners to sing it frequently.

After two Jews escaped from Sobibor in the spring of 1943, Wagner was put in charge of a squad of soldiers from the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, who laid minefields around the camp so as to prevent further escapes. However, these efforts did not prevent another escape, which took form in the Sobibor revolt. Wagner was not present at the camp on the day of the Sobibor revolt on 14 October 1943, having taken a holiday with his then wife Karin to celebrate the birth of a daughter, Marion. The inmates knew of Wagner&#x27;s absence and believed that it would improve their chances of success. Wagner was considered the strictest in terms of prisoner supervision at the camp. After the successful revolt, Wagner was ordered to aid in closing the camp. He helped to dismantle and remove evidence of the camp by ruthlessly commanding the Jewish prisoners who performed this task. For instance, after the &quot;Arbeitsjuden&quot; &quot;worker Jews&quot; had been transported from Treblinka and had successfully torn down the Sobibor barracks, Wagner killed them.

Heinrich Himmler considered Wagner to be &quot;one of the most deserving men of Operation Reinhard&quot; ().

After Sobibor, Wagner was transferred to Italy, where he participated in the deportation of Jews with other staff from the extermination camps and T4.

==After World War II==
Initially unknown, Wagner, disguising himself as a regular military motorcyclist was held and then released from a prisoner of war camp. He found labouring work on houses and eventually was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. Franz Stangl by chance passed Wagner as he worked on a building site demolishing a house and Wagner immediately joined his former commandant and crossed into Italy. Clergy at the &quot;Collegio Teutonico di Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima&quot; sheltered both men in Rome and arranged for them to leave for Syria via the Ratlines. Later both men with Stangl&#x27;s wife and children fled to Brazil, where Wagner was admitted as a permanent resident and Brazilian passport was issued in the name of &quot;Günther Mendel&quot;. He worked as a house-helper for a wealthy Brazilian family and then as a maker of concrete fence posts on a farm. He married a local woman who was a widow and raised her children and lived outside São Paulo.

Wagner was arrested on 30 May 1978 after an investigation by Simon Wiesenthal. When Stangl had been put on trial in Germany, he testified that Wagner was living in Brazil, but the Brazilian police failed to locate him. When a journalist showed Wiesenthal a photograph of a group of German-Brazilians celebrating Hitler&#x27;s eighty-ninth birthday, Wiesenthal falsely identified one of the men as Wagner, thinking that he could spook Wagner into fleeing and inadvertently revealing himself. However, Wagner instead surrendered himself to the Brazilian authorities, who then refused extradition requests from Israel, Austria, Yugoslavia, West Germany, and Poland.

Wagner, in a 1979 BBC interview, showed no remorse for his activities in running the camp, remarking:
In October 1980, Wagner was found dead with a knife in his chest in Atibaia. Wagner&#x27;s attorney reported his death as a suicide though Szlomo Szmajzner implied to Jules Schelvis and Richard Rashke that there may have been more to the story. Several historians, including Rashke himself, have speculated that Szmajzner himself murdered Wagner. Wagner&#x27;s date of death was determined to be 3 October 1980.

<text>Edirne Province () is a Turkish province located in East Thrace. Part of European Turkey, it is one of only three provinces located entirely within continental Europe. Its area is 6,145 km2, and its population is 414,714 (2022). Edirne Province is bordered by Tekirdağ Province and Kırklareli Province to the east, and the Gallipoli peninsula of Çanakkale Province to the south-east. It shares international borders with Bulgaria (Haskovo and Yambol Provinces) to the north and Greece (Eastern Macedonia and Thrace) to the west. Edirne is the capital of the province, and the largest city. It is the only province of Turkey that borders Greece.

== History ==
Edirne, capital of the province, is notable for serving as the third capital of the Ottoman Empire from 1363 to 1453.

Edirne province was included in the Second Inspectorate General which was created on the 19 February 1934 and extended over the provinces of Edirne, Çanakkale, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ. It was ruled by an Inspector General, who had wide-ranging authorities over civilian, military and educational matters. The office of the Inspectorate-General was abandoned in 1948 but the legal framework of the Inspectorate-Generals was only abolished in 1952, under the Government of the Democrat Party.

Until the reign of Selim I, there were remnant populations of so-called Tengri Turks in the province of Edirne who adhered to the ancient beliefs of Tengrism. It is assumed that it was a group of nomadic Yörüks.

== Demographics ==

== Districts ==
Edirne province is divided into 9 districts (capital district in bold):
* Edirne
* Enez
* Havsa
* İpsala
* Keşan

<text>Sophie Louise Balinska-Jundzillova (born 14 May 1977) is an English model and reality television personality.

Her modelling career included a campaign for Gossard bras in 1996, and later included appearances for a range of other brands. Since 2000 she has also appeared in television programmes including &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

== Career ==
Anderton was born in Bristol, England. In 1996 she appeared in the Gossard Glossies and Gossard Wonderbra &quot;Girl in the grass&quot; national advertising campaign shot by Herb Ritts, which included the strapline &quot;Who said a woman couldn&#x27;t get pleasure from something soft?&quot; The campaign attracted a record number of complaints (321) to the Advertising Standards Authority, none of which were upheld.
Anderton has modeled for Gossard (1998), the Flora London Marathon, British Berries summer fruits (2006), &quot;Maxim&quot;, Peacocks and La Senza and graced the cover of British &quot;GQ&quot;.

In 2004, Anderton was a contestant on the fourth series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She appeared in the TV series &quot;Simply the Best&quot; and a celebrity edition of the UK version of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. In 2005, she appeared on the programme &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, which documented her attempts to quit smoking cigarettes; she later became a representative for a smoking cessation program called QS7D (Quit Smoking in 7 Days).

In 2006, Anderton was a contestant on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Love Island&quot;. In the same year, she appeared on Sky1&#x27;s &quot;Cirque de Celebrité&quot; but withdrew after sustaining ligament damage.

In August 2013, Anderton became a housemate on the twelfth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. She was eliminated from competition in an episode that aired on 3 September 2013.

== Personal life ==

From 2004 until 2007, Anderton was a patron of Action on Addiction in London, a charity and addiction research centre investigating drug and alcohol dependence.

She was misdiagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder in 2006. She said, &quot;I had depression. They wrongly diagnosed me and put me on a bucket load of blood pills. It was absolutely bonkers.&quot;

In 2009, Anderton complained to the police about dozens of text messages left on her mobile phone. A man was eventually charged with harassment and convicted.

In 2013, just before she participated in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 12&quot;, Anderton acknowledged past difficulties with substance abuse.

In 2021, Anderton married Count Kazimierz Balinski-Jundzill, the father of Ella Balinska.

<text>Douglas MacArthur II (July 5, 1909 – November 15, 1997) was an American diplomat. During his diplomatic career, he served as United States ambassador to Japan, Belgium, Austria, and Iran, as well as Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs. He was the nephew of the U.S. general Douglas MacArthur.

==Early life and education==
MacArthur&#x27;s parents were Captain Arthur MacArthur III and Mary McCalla MacArthur. Through his mother, he was a grandson of Bowman H. McCalla, great-grandson of Colonel Horace Binney Sargent, and great-great-grandson of Lucius Manlius Sargent. Named for his uncle, General Douglas MacArthur, he was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 1909.

MacArthur graduated from Milton Academy in Milton, Mass., and from Yale College, Class of 1932. He married Laura Louise Barkley on August 21, 1934, the daughter of future U.S. Vice President Alben Barkley.

He married Laura Louise Barkley, the daughter of President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s vice president Alben W. Barkley in 1934. They had a daughter named Laura MacArthur, two grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. Douglas&#x27;s daughter married Henry Goditiabois-Deacon, a Belgian man with whom she had a daughter. President Johnson signed a special bill conferring U.S. citizenship to Laura&#x27;s daughter in 1965.

==Military Service==
In the mid 1930s, MacArthur served as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve, Field Artillery Branch. He also worked as an assistant to the sub-district supervisor in the Washington D.C. Army headquarters of sub-district 17.

==Diplomatic career==
After serving as an Army officer, MacArthur began his Foreign Service career in 1935 with a post in Vancouver. He was assigned to Vichy France during the early years of World War II, served as secretary of the U.S. Embassy there from 1940 to 1942, and was interned in Baden Baden, Germany with other U.S. diplomatic staff and civilians for two years after the U.S. broke relations with the Vichy government. Following an internee exchange in March 1944, he served as part of General Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s political staff and then led the political section of the U.S. Embassy in Paris until 1948. He went on to become chief of the State Department&#x27;s Division of Western European Affairs in 1949, where he assisted in the formation of NATO, and served as Counselor of the State Department from 1953 to 1956, where he led the U.S. negotiations for the SEATO treaty.
=== Ambassador to Japan ===
MacArthur was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Japan in December 1956 and presented his credentials in February 1957.

During his four years in Tokyo, MacArthur oversaw the re-negotiation of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, known as &quot;Anpo&quot; in Japanese. MacArthur appeared on the cover of the June 27, 1960, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in which he was characterized as &quot;the principal architect of present-day U.S. policy toward Japan.&quot;

However, the new treaty was met with the massive Anpo Protests in Japan, and was only ratified with great difficulty. As the protests grew in size in June 1960, MacArthur summoned the heads of major newspapers and television station NHK to his office and demanded more favorable coverage of the treaty.

Then on June 10, MacArthur deliberately provoked the so-called &quot;Hagerty Incident&quot; (ハガチー事件, &quot;Hagachii jiken&quot;). That afternoon, MacArthur was leaving Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda Airport in a black car carrying himself and President Eisenhower&#x27;s press secretary James Hagerty, who had just arrived in Japan to prepare for a planned visit by Eisenhower, when MacArthur ordered that the car be deliberately driven into a large crowd of anti-treaty protesters. The mob surrounded the car and proceeded to smash the car&#x27;s windows and tail lights, slash its tires, and dance on the roof until MacArthur and Hagerty finally had to be rescued by a U.S. Marine helicopter. MacArthur had hoped that by provoking the incident, he would force the Japanese government to carry out a more forceful police response to suppress the protests ahead of Eisenhower&#x27;s planned arrival. However, MacArthur&#x27;s gambit backfired, as widespread shock at the Hagerty Incident helped force prime minister Nobusuke Kishi to cancel Eisenhower&#x27;s visit, for fears that his safety could not be guaranteed. 

It was revealed in 1974 that MacArthur had negotiated a secret agreement with the Japanese foreign minister Aiichiro Fujiyama to allow the transit of American nuclear weapons through Japanese territory. It was also revealed, through documents declassified in the 2000s, that MacArthur pressured the Japanese judiciary, including Chief Justice Kōtarō Tanaka, to uphold the legality of the United States military presence in Japan after a lower court decision found it unconstitutional.

=== Other posts ===
Following his time in Japan, MacArthur served as Ambassador to Belgium (1961–1965), Assistant Secretary of State (1965–1967), Ambassador to Austria (1967–1969) and Ambassador to Iran (1969–1972). While in the latter post, he escaped an attempted kidnapping in 1970 by a network of opposition guerillas in Iran. Months later, Iranian military officials sentenced four guerrillas to life imprisonment for their involvement in the attempted kidnapping. 

== Later life and death ==
MacArthur died in Washington, D.C., in 1997.
== Legacy ==
Douglas&#x27;s addresses, speeches and statements, 1957-1995; correspondence as U.S. ambassador; writings of Douglas MacArthur II; and photographs of the MacArthur family, 1905 to 1997, were donated to the MacArthur Memorial by his daughter Laura MacArthur.

<doc id="890445" wikidata="Q11815640" url="?curid=890445" title="Styphnolobium">
<text>Styphnolobium is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae. It includes nine species of small trees and shrubs native to China and to the Americas, from the southern United States to Colombia. It belongs to subfamily Faboideae, and was formerly included within a broader interpretation of the genus &quot;Sophora&quot;. It was recently assigned to the unranked, monophyletic &quot;Cladrastis&quot; clade. They differ from the genus &quot;Calia&quot; (mescalbeans) in having deciduous leaves and flowers in axillary, not terminal, racemes. The leaves are pinnate, with 9–21 leaflets, and the flowers in pendulous racemes similar to those of the black locust. Necklacepod is a common name for plants in this genus.

==Etymology==
From Greek &quot;styphno-&quot;, &quot;stryphno-&quot; &quot;sour, astringent&quot; and &quot;lobion&quot; &quot;pod&quot;, because of the fresh pods&#x27; pulp taste.

==Species==
&quot;Styphnolobium&quot; comprises the following species: 

===Section &quot;Oresbios&quot;===
* &quot;Styphnolobium affine&quot; , the coralbean or Eve&#x27;s necklace is native to the southern United States in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. It is a large shrub or small tree, growing to 5–7 m tall, with white or pale violet flowers. The seeds of this species are believed to be poisonous. The sapwood leaches a yellow dye on contact with water.
* &quot;Styphnolobium burseroides&quot; 
* &quot;Styphnolobium caudatum&quot; is native to Nicaragua.
* &quot;Styphnolobium conzattii&quot; 
* &quot;Styphnolobium monteviridis&quot; is native to Central America.
* &quot;Styphnolobium parviflorum&quot; 
* &quot;Styphnolobium protantherum&quot; 
* &quot;Styphnolobium sporadicum&quot; 

===Section &quot;Styphnolobium&quot;===
* &quot;Styphnolobium japonicum&quot; , the pagoda tree (Chinese Scholar, Japanese pagodatree; syn. &quot;Sophora japonica&quot;), is native to eastern Asia (mainly China; despite the name, it is introduced in Japan), is a popular ornamental tree in Europe, North America and South Africa, grown for its white flowers, borne in late summer after most other flowering trees have long finished flowering. It grows into a lofty tree 10–20 m tall with an equal spread, and produces a fine, dark brown timber.

==Uses==
The pagoda tree is widely used in bonsai gardening. The Guilty Chinese Scholartree was a historic pagoda tree in Beijing, on which the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Chongzhen, hanged himself.

&quot;Styphnolobium japonicum&quot; (Chinese: ; pinyin: huái; formerly &quot;Sophora japonica&quot;) is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine.

<text>Abraham Trembley (3 September 1710 – 12 May 1784 Geneva) was a Genevan naturalist. He is best known for being the first to study freshwater polyps or &quot;hydra&quot; and for being among the first to develop experimental zoology. His mastery of experimental method has led some historians of science to credit him as the &quot;father of biology&quot;.

He also wrote on religion and morals.

==Biography==
Trembley came from an officer&#x27;s family from Geneva, Republic of Geneva.
He was related to Charles Bonnet, with whom he corresponded regularly, and befriended with René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (1683–1757) and Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729–1799). Trembley acted as tutor to the two children of Count Willem Bentinck van Rhoon (1704–1774), a prominent Dutch politician at the time. The boys were 3 and 6 when Trembley, during lessons in which he went fishing in the ponds outside the house, accidentally discovered the regenerative powers of the Hydra. Those lessons took place at the Count&#x27;s summer residence of Sorgvliet nearby The Hague. Sketches and drawings of his experiments with the children, made by Cornelis Pronk, are kept in the archives of the town of The Hague, the Netherlands.

== Work on &quot;Hydra&quot; ==
While Trembley thought he had discovered a new species, Leeuwenhoek had in fact first published on &quot;Hydra&quot; in a 1702–1703 volume of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, describing them as a type of &quot;animalculum&quot;. In his work Leeuwenhoek clearly described the process of budding, as well as their tentacles&#x27; contractility and the presence of cnidocyte batteries on tentacles.
Trembley&#x27;s findings were published in a groundbreaking book in 1744, &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;histoire d&#x27;un genre de polypes d&#x27;eau douce&quot;, Gebr. Verbeek, Leiden, translated into German in 1775 as &quot;Abhandlungen zur Geschichte einer Polypenart des süssen Wassers&quot;. The book includes some of the (engraved) drawings of Pronk. His discoveries led to his membership of the prestigious Royal Society in London and a correspondent member of the académie des sciences in France. He became also recipient of the Copley medal.

Some attribute Trembley as being the first to study stem cells, although he obviously did not refer to them as such. Trembley did however make note of their incredible regenerative capacity.

<text>Henry (Harry) Arthur Hooton (9 October 1908 – 27 June 1961) was an Australian poet and social commentator whose writing spanned the years 1930s–1961. He was described by a biographer as ahead of his time, or rather &quot;of his time while the majority of progressive artists and thinkers in Australia lagged far behind&quot;. Initially a socialist and &quot;wobbly&quot;, he later professed anarchism and became an associate of the Sydney Push during the 1940s, with connections to many other Australian writers, film makers and artists. Hooton&#x27;s constant attitude and literary style was extravagant, provocative and explicitly outrageous.

==Early life==
Hooton was born in Doncaster, Yorkshire, England His father was Levi Hooton, a railway shunter, and his mother&#x27;s maiden name was Margaret Lester-Glaister. He had an older brother, Frank.

At the age of 16 he arrived in Sydney on 28 October 1924, on the ship &quot;Demosthenes&quot; as part of an Empire scheme, the Dreadnought Trust, with fifty-nine other boys. After humping his swag around much of New South Wales and Queensland through the Great Depression, in 1936, just as his first pieces of writing were being published, Hooton was introduced to the poet Marie E. J. Pitt living in Melbourne and carried on a correspondence with her for the next eight years.

==Literary development==
Hooton&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;These Poets&quot;, appeared in 1941, published at his own expense in a small print run of up to 400 copies, most of which Hooton either gave away or swapped. It struck a chord with readers, receiving much critical acclaim.

In 1943 Hooton met the authors Nettie Palmer and Miles Franklin while they were travelling through Newcastle. Through Miles Franklin he was introduced to the writings of Carl Sandburg and the American literary scene. Moving to Sydney in 1943 Hooton submitted a book of poems titled &quot;Leave Yourself Alone&quot; to a publisher without success. Later he self-published &quot;Things You See When You Haven&#x27;t Got A Gun&quot;. In a new magazine, untitled, unpretentious and called simply &quot;No. 1&quot;, the poetry of Hooton, A. D. Hope, and Gary Lyle was featured. Hooton and Hope also featured in &quot;No. 2&quot;.

Hooton&#x27;s &quot;Things You See When You Haven&#x27;t Got A Gun&quot; was reviewed by Max Harris in one line in the Ern Malley issue of &quot;Angry Penguins&quot;, &quot;Our anarchist bull careers madly through his intellectual fog.&quot;

===&quot;Sydney Push&quot; milieu===
In Sydney after World War II, Hooton was drawn to the intellectual circles of Sydney University, the Sydney Push and the wider artistic society of the Lincoln coffee lounge, described by Richard Appleton as the &quot;Mecca of the Australian arts&quot;, and the Tudor Hotel. Appleton and others have noted Hooton&#x27;s opposition to the generally favoured realist philosophy of Professor John Anderson and its activist offshoot, the Libertarian Society.When Anderson&#x27;s realist philosophy held intellectual sway at Sydney University, Hooton attacked vehemently philosophy and universities (he claimed sometimes that Anderson was his main enemy, although he defended Anderson when he thought he was being wrongly attacked). To a literary world influenced by people such as Joyce, Yeats, Pound and Eliot, Hooton decried them as anti-artists, philistines and charlatans. He admitted only a few people as poets, including Whitman, Wilde and Henry Lawson. Appleton explained: &quot;Hooton held that polemic was an art form and that all poetry should be didactic&quot;, an obtuse view which, coupled with his paradoxical debating style, brought Hooton into conflict with Libertarians (who especially revered Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;) and with more ic poets such as Lex Banning, James McAuley and A. D. Hope.

Yet his presence was compelling and characteristically welcomed by those who would otherwise be in disagreement. Many years later, Germaine Greer noted his influence on her: ...Harry, the utopian anarchist who had admired her red stockings, who believed people were perfect and who was not weighed down by the tremendous forces the anarchistic pessimists felt bore down on them all the time. &quot;Alas, I understand him much better now,&quot; she said, twenty years later. &quot;... but I think a lot of the things I&#x27;ve done since I&#x27;ve done out of a desire to please Harry Hooton...&quot;

While Hooton was living a very bohemian life in Sydney, he was connecting with literary people in Japan, India, Greece, South Africa, England, France, New Zealand, and the USA. Hooton had corresponded with counter-culture figures in California, and with Tuli Kupferberg who would later form the rock group The Fugs. He contributed to many periodicals and journals in addition to those he brought out himself. &quot;He has published not only in Australia but in London, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, etc, and has had some material translated into Greek. He is far better known overseas than he is here&quot;.

===Anarcho-technocracy===
Hooton argued that man should have power over things, including machines, but never over other men, applying to himself the term &quot;anarcho-technocrat&quot;. &quot;He regarded the age of man as passed, and sees the age of the machine as the proper object of pursuit... In his quest for power over machines, Hooton is a technocrat, and in his opposition to power over men, he is an anarchist.&quot;

Hooton never completed his philosophical treatise, titled &quot;Militant Materialism&quot;, although he did complete six of its eight chapters. His ideas were magically simple. Leave man alone, man is perfect. Concentrate instead on matter. He formulated what he called Anarcho-technocracy: &#x27;The Politics of Things&#x27;.

Hooton saw proof copies of the last book published during his lifetime, &quot;It Is Great To Be Alive&quot;, published by Margaret Elliott (Margaret Fink), just before he died of cancer in 1961.

An 83-minute experimental film, &quot;Harry Hooton – Outsider Poet&quot; was made by Arthur and Corinne Cantrill in 1969. In the soundtrack, Hooton outlines his social philosophy in a series of recordings made shortly before his death in 1961.

<text>Farmersgolf (Boerengolf in Dutch) is a farm land game modelled after the sport of golf. It originated from a cheese farm run by Peter Weenink in Lievelde, a small village in the Achterhoek region of the Netherlands.

It was invented out of frustration with costly golf course fees in the Netherlands, and with a test called the GVB (&quot;Golfvaardigheidsbewijs&quot;) which most Dutch courses require players to pass before being allowed to play.

The first game was played in 1999, and since then games have also been played in Germany, Belgium, Sweden, France and Finland. There are currently about 70 farmers golf locations in the Netherlands, and over 110 Europe-wide. In 2005, over 10,000 people played the game on Weenink&#x27;s course alone.

Farmersgolf is played with a special wooden golf club, with a club head in the shape of a wooden shoe, or clog (in Dutch: &quot;klomp&quot;). A farmers golf ball is, with its 20 centimeter diameter, much larger than a traditional golf ball.

A golf hole is made by placing a bucket in the ground and a flagpole beside it. The 8 to 10 holes have, on average, more than 200 meters distance between them.

The defining feature of Farmersgolf is that the game is played on an otherwise unaltered farm. Obstacles and &quot;hazards&quot; include anything one might find on the farm, including live cows, ditches and barbed wire. 

The Farmersgolf name is trademarked in several countries and Weenink hopes to establish an international association that will raise the game to the level of serious sport.

=== Acting ===
LaRue was the co-host and announcer on &quot;Candid Camera&quot; from 1991 to 1992. From 1993 to 1997, and again from 2002 to 2005, LaRue portrayed Dr. Maria Santos Grey on &quot;All My Children&quot;. There, she was half of &quot;All My Children&quot; supercouple Edmund and Maria. She received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination in the category of &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series&quot; for &quot;All My Children&quot;. She also received a nomination in 2004 in the category of &quot;Outstanding Original Song&quot; for composing the song &quot;Dance Again with You&quot;, which was used as a backdrop to the lovemaking scene after the third marriage of the characters Edmund and Maria in June 2003.

In 2010, LaRue reprised her role as Maria temporarily on January 5 for &quot;All My Children&quot;&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

Bradford would photograph women he met in bars and photo shoots under the guise that he would assist their modeling careers. The incident was used in &quot;CSI: Miami&quot; in the season five episode &quot;Darkroom&quot; soon after the revelation. Nika guest-starred in the episode as a reporter. She was initially offered the role of Eva&#x27;s on-screen sister and a surviving victim, but declined that role, describing it as being &quot;too surreal&quot;.

<text>John Charles Edward Alder (born 29 November 1944), also known as Twink, is an English drummer, actor, singer, and songwriter who was a central figure in the English psychedelic and proto-punk movement.

In 2006, Alder converted to Islam, and changed his name to Mohammed Abdullah. However, he still records under the name Twink.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Alder was born in Colchester, Essex, in the United Kingdom. Many of his family members were also musicians, including his grandmother, who was a concert pianist and soloist.

Alder was interested in music from a young age. His professional career began in 1963 when he played the drums for Dane Stephens and the Deep Beats, a rhythm and blues band from Colchester. In 1964, after performing for a year, the band changed its name to The Fairies.

Due to the band&#x27;s growing popularity, its members began receiving regular gifts from their music fans. Alder, who had long curly hair at the time, regularly received bottles of Twink brand home perm lotion. He eventually adopted &#x27;Twink&#x27; as his stage name.

Twink later reunited with Dane Stephens and Mick Weaver from The Fairies for two tracks on his 1991 album &quot;Odds &amp; Beginnings&quot;.

=== The In-Crowd and Tomorrow ===
In 1965, Twink moved to London, living in the Chelsea area. When the Fairies broke up in August 1966, he joined a rhythm and blues/soul music band called the In-Crowd whose previous drummer had left. Other members of the In-Crowd included Steve Howe (guitar; later of Yes fame), singer Keith West, and bassist John &#x27;Junior&#x27; Wood. A few months later, the band decided to change their name to Tomorrow. The success of West&#x27;s solo recording, &quot;Excerpt from A Teenage Opera&quot;, resulted in the band&#x27;s breakup and led to a one-off single by the short-lived band &#x27;Aquarian Age&#x27; (Twink &amp; Junior).

In his book &quot;White Bicycles,&quot; Joe Boyd cites a Tomorrow show at the UFO Club in London&#x27;s Camden borough—and Twink&#x27;s performance in particular—as the zenith of 60&#x27;s pop culture. Tomorrow also played with guitarist Jimi Hendrix at UFO.

In 1967, Twink completed a recording session with a group called Santa Barbara Machine Head. It featured two former members of the beat group the Birds: Ron Wood (later of &#x27;The Creation&#x27;, The Faces and The Rolling Stones) and Kim Gardner (later also of &#x27;The Creation&#x27; and Ashton, Gardner &amp; Dyke), and keyboardist Jon Lord (later of Deep Purple).

=== Pretty Things ===
Twink replaced Skip Alan in the band the Pretty Things, joining Phil May, Dick Taylor, Wally Allen, and Jon Povey. He participated in the making of their classic album &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot;. He was also a member of this group when it appeared in the Norman Wisdom film &quot;What&#x27;s Good for the Goose&quot;. Twink became famous for his outrageous behaviour such as climbing the speaker stacks and diving into the audience when the band performed at a free open-air concert in London&#x27;s Hyde Park.

=== &quot;Think Pink&quot; ===
Twink recorded his first solo album, &quot;Think Pink&quot;, toward the end of his tenure with the Pretty Things. Supporting musicians included proto-punk forerunners, the Deviants, including Mick Farren (who produced the album), Paul Rudolph (guitar), Duncan &#x27;Sandy&#x27; Sanderson, and Steve Peregrin Took (of Tyrannosaurus Rex, who contributed two of the songs). It also included May, Povey, Waller, and Victor Unitt of Pretty Things, Viv Prince (ex-Pretty Things), John &#x27;The Honk&#x27; Lodge (Junior&#x27;s Eyes, Quiver), &#x27;Junior&#x27; Wood, and the enigmatic &#x27;Pink Fairies Motorcycle Club and All-Star Rock and Roll Band&#x27;. The name &quot;Pink Fairies&quot; was derived from a story by Deviants manager Jamie Mandelkau, who may not have been aware of Twink&#x27;s former band.

=== Pink Fairies ===
The lineup of the Pink Fairies (Mark 1) featured &quot;Think Pink&quot; musicians Twink, Took, and Farren–-all three having left their respective bands-–and was named after the &#x27;Pink Fairies Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Club&#x27;, a loose group of affiliated musicians including Took, Farren, the Deviants, Syd Barrett (formerly of Pink Floyd), and the Pretty Things. They played in Ladbroke Grove, home of the UK underground. The Mark 1 lineup—including Twink&#x27;s girlfriend Sally &quot;Silver Darling&quot; Melzer on keyboards—performed one shambolic gig in Manchester and recorded Farren&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Mona – The Carnivorous Circus&quot;, in late 1969 before falling apart. Took, Farren, former Entire Sioux Nation guitarist and bassist (and later Motörhead founder) Larry Wallis, and Tim Taylor then assembled the band that became Shagrat, with Farren departing before any recordings were made and drummer Phil Lenoir joining to complete the line-up.

Pink Fairies (Mark 2) was formed in early 1970 by Twink with Mick Farren&#x27;s former bandmates, the Deviants. The two-drummer Pink Fairies line-up recorded a single called &quot;The Snake&quot; / &quot;Do It&quot; followed by the &quot;Never Never Land&quot; album before Twink left in 1971 (although he would periodically return). A cover-version of &quot;The Snake&quot; was later recorded by Algy Ward&#x27;s heavy rock band, &quot;Tank.&quot;

===Stars===
After a spell living in Morocco, Twink moved to Cambridge and worked with the &#x27;Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band&#x27;, which initially included vocalist/guitarist Bruce Michael Paine (ex-Apple Pie and star of the San Francisco production of &quot;Hair&quot;) and &#x27;The Honk&#x27; playing bass. He also played in a band named ZZZ with Alan Lee Shaw and Rod Latter, who later reunited as the Rings. The Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band, now with ex-Delivery bass player Jack Monck, backed American blues guitarist Eddie &quot;Guitar&quot; Burns at King&#x27;s College Cellar in January 1972. Jack&#x27;s wife Jenny Spires, an old friend of Twink and former girlfriend of Syd Barrett (ex-Pink Floyd) went with Syd to the gig and brought his guitar along, and even jammed with them at one point. The next day, the Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band, with guests Fred Frith and Syd Barrett, played on a bill with Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies.

In the next two days, Twink formed the short-lived trio Stars with Barrett and Monck. Stars played a handful of well-received shows. However, Syd, who was mentally fragile, quit after reading a negative review by Roy Hollingworth in &quot;Melody Maker.&quot; After Stars disbanded, Twink moved back to London.

===1972–1975===
From 1972 to 1975, Twink periodically performed with fellow Ladbroke Grove community band Hawkwind during the transition from the band&#x27;s original drummer to its replacement Simon King. Twink also played with the band Glider but did not release recordings.

===1975 Pink Fairies reunion===
In July 1975, the Pink Fairies staged a reunion gig at the Roundhouse, featuring the then-current line-up of Russell Hunter, Duncan Sanderson, and Larry Wallis, joined by former members Twink and Paul Rudolph. They released the recorded show as a live album in 1982.

=== The Rings and punk===
Twink formed the Fallen Angels in August 1976 with Steve Marriott and former Allstars band members Greg Ridley and Mickey Finn. On the way to the band&#x27;s first gig, a car accident left Twink hospitalised, after which this line-up disintegrated. The Fallen Angels wound up backing Phil May on a solo album. Twink then worked as a vocalist with the Rings in early 1977, releasing one of the first punk rock singles, &quot;I Wanna Be Free&quot;, produced by former Sparks member Martin Gordon. Other members of the band included Alan Lee Shaw and Rod Latter of the Adverts. After Twink left, the other members of the Rings formed the Maniacs.

Twink coined the term &quot;acid punk&quot; to describe his music and went on to release an EP called &quot;Do It &#x27;77&quot; in February 1978. It included the songs &quot;Psychedelic Punkeroo&quot; (about Syd Barrett and songwriting credited to &#x27;A. Syd&#x27;) and &quot;Enter The Diamonds&quot;, both of which featured a band comprising Twink (drums/lead vocals), Kid Rogers (of Kid Rogers and the Henchmen; guitars/vocals), Fingers Falkner (keyboards), and Chris Chesney (lead guitar). According to Twink, &quot;It was the &quot;Psychedelic Punkaroo&quot; project, but Chiswick Records didn&#x27;t like the track and I jammed &#x27;Do It&#x27; with the Lightning Raiders, which they preferred.&quot; According to Duncan &#x27;Danger Sun&#x27; Sanderson (bass, Lightning Raiders &amp; ex-Pink Fairies), &quot;Twink came round my house and dragged me down the studio while I was still asleep one morning, and Little John Hodge (lead guitar, Lightning Raiders) just came along to deliver a guitar. Twink had us jam through &#x27;Do It&#x27;, so we did it. Kid and John hadn&#x27;t even heard the flaming song before. In the end, he jumps up and shouts &#x27;That&#x27;s it, thanks, lads!&#x27; We didn&#x27;t even know it was being taped!&quot; Twink responded that &quot;A second take of &#x27;Do It&#x27; was a contradiction&quot;. The EP was credited to Twink and the Fairies.

Twink next moved to Belgium, where he played drums on the recording of British punk rocker Elton Motello&#x27;s &quot;Victims of Time&quot; album (1978, Pinball).

===1980s===
After a long period of inactivity, Twink released a solo single in 1986 called &quot;Apocalipstic,&quot; which inaugurated his new, self-titled record label and a run of new solo releases up to the early 1990s.

In 1987, he rejoined the Pink Fairies for a reunion album. During the subsequent Pink Fairies tour, Twink met members of Plasticland, which resulted in the collaboration &quot;You Need a Fairy Godmother&quot;, released in 1989 on Midnight Records. He also joined a brief lineup of &#x27;Magic Muscle&#x27; in 1988 for a tour and a live album, and he released a collaborative album with The Bevis Frond in 1990.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Twink released his second solo album, &quot;Mr. Rainbow&quot;, with Robbie Gladwell on guitar and Andy Dowding on drums. Later in the decade, he collaborated with Hawkwind founder Nik Turner in the band PinkWind, writing about the semi-legendary Hawkwind/Pink Fairies jam sessions of the early 1970s. Turner brought in the Wind, and Twink provided the Pink. PinkWind released two albums (one credited to the HawkFairies). Some lineups also featured Judge Trev Thoms of Inner City Unit and Steve Took&#x27;s Horns.
The &quot;Out of the Pink into the Blues&quot; album by &#x27;Mouse &amp; Twink: Fairies&#x27; was released around 1996 and &quot;was recorded at the Pink Bridge [from the] mid-&#x27;70s till [the] &#x27;80s&quot; by Twink and P. &#x27;Mouse&#x27; Pracowik (Peter Pracownik of Astralasia) who were on guitar, Andrew Doran (vocals), Matthew Bailey (bass) and Chris Pinkerton (drums).

The &#x27;Get Back&#x27; label released some archive collections from the Pink Fairies era. Twink&#x27;s record label then released two &#x27;Pink Fairies&#x27; albums recorded by Twink and Paul Rudolph in 1996/1997.

===2000 – present===
In the early 2000s, Twink spent time in Los Angeles before settling in Marrakesh, Morocco.

2013 saw the re-release of &quot;Think Pink&quot; on the Sunbeam label in CD, vinyl, and digital formats. It predated a new release called &quot;You Reached for the Stars.&quot; It also included a collaboration with the Italian group the Technicolour Dream, featuring guest guitarist Brian Godding from Blossom Toes. The album was recorded in Rome and mastered at Abbey Road Studios by sound engineer Peter Mew, who also worked on Pretty Things and Tomorrow recordings in the 1960s. In 2014, Twink started recording a new album, &quot;Think Pink II&quot;, with a similar concept of recording, featuring as many guests as on the original. The album was finished in 2015 and released in August the same year.

In spring 2018, under the band name Star Sponge Vision, Twink and Jon Povey released a concept album of music inspired by the poetry of Aleister Crowley, titled &quot;Crowley and Me&quot;.

== Acting career ==
Twink appeared in the 1960s film &quot;Smashing Time&quot; with the other members of Tomorrow as the fictional band the Snarks. Tomorrow was also due to feature in &quot;Blowup&quot;, and even recorded a title song for the film, but was ultimately replaced by the Yardbirds. Similarly, Twink appeared with the Pretty Things under their pseudonym &quot;Electric Banana&quot; in the film &quot;What&#x27;s Good for the Goose&quot;.

Twink also worked as an actor during the late 1980s, appearing in several United Kingdom television series, including:
* &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; a BBC1 British sitcom.
* &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, a 10-part serial adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel.
*&quot;Chocky&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, which was based on &quot;Chocky&quot;, a science fiction novel by John Wyndham. The three Chocky series were produced by Thames Television.
* &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, a BBC series

<text>Pierce Butler (March 17, 1866 – November 16, 1939) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1923 until his death in 1939. He is notable for being the first Supreme Court justice from Minnesota, and for being a Democrat appointed by a Republican president. He was a staunch conservative and was regarded as a part of the Four Horsemen, the conservative bloc that dominated the Supreme Court during the 1930s. A devout Catholic, he was also the sole dissenter in the later case &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, though he did not write an opinion.

==Early life and education==
Butler was born in Northfield, Minnesota, to Patrick and Mary Ann Butler. Born in a log cabin, he was the sixth of nine children. All but his sister lived to adulthood. His parents were Catholic immigrants from County Wicklow, Ireland, who had met in Galena, Illinois. They had left the same part of Ireland because of the Great Famine.

Butler graduated from Carleton College in 1887. He received both a degree in the arts and a degree in science. He then read the law for one year before being admitted to the bar in 1888. He married Annie M. Cronin in 1891.

==Legal career==
He was elected as county attorney in Ramsey County in 1892, and re-elected in 1894. Butler joined the law firm of How &amp; Eller in 1896, which became How &amp; Butler after the death of Homer C. Eller the following year. He accepted an offer to practice in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he took care of railroad-related litigation for James J. Hill. He was highly successful in representing railroads.

In 1905 he returned to private practice and rejoined Jared How. He had also served as a lawyer for the company owned by his five brothers. In 1908, Butler was elected President of the Minnesota State Bar Association.

From 1912 to 1922, he worked in railroad law in Canada, alternately representing the shareholders of railroad companies and the Canadian government; he produced favorable results for both. When he was nominated for the United States Supreme Court in 1922, Butler was in the process of winning approximately $12,000,000 for the Toronto Street Railway shareholders.

==Supreme Court justice==

===Nomination and confirmation===

On December 5, 1922, Butler was nominated by President Warren G. Harding as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, to succeed William R. Day. Although he was supported by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, Butler&#x27;s opposition to &quot;radical&quot; and &quot;disloyal&quot; professors at the University of Minnesota (where he had served on the Board of Regents) made him a controversial Supreme Court nominee. Farmer–Labor Senator-elect Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota opposed him, as did the Progressive Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin. Also against his confirmation were labor activists, some liberal magazines (&quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;) and the Ku Klux Klan because he was Catholic. His appointment was supported by prominent Roman Catholics, fellow lawyers (the Minnesota State Bar Association strongly endorsed him), and business groups (especially railroad companies), as well as Minnesota&#x27;s incumbent senators, Republicans Knute Nelson and lame duck Frank B. Kellogg. Butler was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 21, 1922, by a 61–8 vote, and took the judicial oath of office on January 2, 1923.

===Court service===
As an associate justice, Butler vigorously opposed regulation of business and the implementation of welfare programs by the federal government (as unconstitutional). During the Great Depression, he ruled against the constitutionality of many &quot;New Deal&quot; laws – the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the National Recovery Administration – which had been supported by his fellow Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt. This earned him a place among the so-called &quot;Four Horsemen,&quot; which also included James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter. During his sixteen years on the bench, Justice Butler authored 327 majority opinions as well as 50 minority opinions.

He wrote the majority opinion (6–3) in &quot;United States v. Schwimmer,&quot; in which the Hungarian immigrant&#x27;s application for citizenship was denied because of her candid refusal to take an oath to &quot;take up arms&quot; for her adopted country.

In &quot;Palko v. Connecticut&quot;, Butler was the lone dissenter; the rest of the justices believed that a state was not restrained from trying a man a second time for the same crime. Butler believed this violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

He sided with the majority in &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot;, holding unconstitutional an Oregon state law that prohibited parents from sending their children to private or religious schools.

In the 1927 decision for &quot;Buck v. Bell,&quot; Butler was the only Justice who dissented from the 8–1 ruling and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.&#x27;s opinion holding that the forced sterilization of an allegedly &quot;feeble-minded&quot; woman in Virginia was constitutional. Holmes believed that Butler&#x27;s religion influenced his thinking in &quot;Buck&quot;, remarking that &quot;Butler knows this is good law, I wonder whether he will have the courage to vote with us in spite of his religion.&quot; Although Butler dissented in both &quot;Buck&quot; and &quot;Palko&quot;, he did not write a dissenting opinion in either case; the practice of a Justice&#x27;s noting a dissent without opinion was much more common then than it would be in the later 20th and early 21st centuries.

Another consequential dissent was from the opinion expressed in &quot;Olmstead v. United States&quot;, which upheld federal wiretapping. He took an expansive view of 4th Amendment protections.

==Death and legacy==
On November 15, 1939, Butler went into a Washington, D.C., hospital for &quot;a minor ailment&quot; but died in the early morning hours of November 16, at the age of 73 while still on the Court. He was the last serving Supreme Court Justice appointed by President Harding. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Paul.

The bulk of his and his family&#x27;s collected papers are with the Minnesota Historical Society. Other papers are collected elsewhere.

Pierce Butler Route in Saint Paul, Minnesota, is named in honor of Butler&#x27;s son, Pierce Butler Jr..

<text>Boating is the leisurely activity of travelling by boat, or the recreational use of a boat whether powerboats, sailboats, or man-powered vessels (such as rowing and paddle boats), focused on the travel itself, as well as sports activities, such as fishing or waterskiing. It is a popular activity, and there are millions of boaters worldwide.

==Types of boats==

Boats (boat types) can be categorized into 3 different types of board categories: unpowered, motor boats, and sailboats. Recreational boats (sometimes called pleasure craft, especially for less sporting activities) fall into several broad categories, and additional subcategories. Broad categories include dinghies (generally under 16 feet (5 m) powered by sail, small engines, or muscle power) usually made from hardwood or inflatable rubber. paddle sports boats (kayaks, rowing shells, canoes), runabouts (15–25 ft. (5–8 m) powerboats with either outboard, sterndrive, or inboard engines), daysailers (14–25 Ft. (4–8 m) sailboats, frequently with a small auxiliary engine), cruisers (25–65 ft. (8–20 m) powerboats with cabins), and cruising and racing sailboats (25–65 Ft. (8–20 m) sailboats with auxiliary engines). Center console (18 to 75 ft. (18-23m) power boats that have a large interior typically used for fishing, with its high speed performance design and engine also used in water sports. Deck boats (25-35 ft.(8-11m) that are characterized by an open deck area and used typically for leisure activities. Lifeboats (smaller, quicker watercrafts equipped with emergency equipment in which to help voyagers in case of emergency in the water.

==Boating activities==

Boating activities are as varied as the boats and boaters who participate, and new ways of enjoying the water are constantly being discovered. Broad categories include the following:

*Paddlesports include ears (lakes), swiftwater (rivers), and oceangoing types, usually covered-cockpit kayaks.
**Canoes are popular on lakes and rivers due to their carrying capacity and efficiency on the water. They are also easy to &quot;portage&quot;, or carry overland around obstructions like rapids, or just down to the water from a car or cabin.
**Kayaks can be found on calm inland waters, whitewater rivers, and along the coasts in the oceans. Known for their maneuverability and seaworthiness, kayaks take many shapes depending on their desired use. Rowing craft are also popular for fishing, as a tender to a larger vessel, or as a competitive sport.
**Rowing shells are extremely long and narrow, and are intended to convert as much of the rower&#x27;s muscle power as possible into speed. The ratio of length of waterline to beam has much importance in marine mechanics and design.
**Row boats or dinghies are oar powered, and generally restricted to protected waters. Rowboats are generally heavy craft compared to other has
*Sailing can be either competitive, as in collegiate dinghy racing, or purely recreational as when sailing on a lake with family or friends.
**Small sailboats also called dinghies are commonly made from fiberglass, and will have wood, aluminum, or carbon-fiber spars, and generally a sloop rig (two sails: a mainsail and a jib, commonly include 3rd sail the spinnaker for going downwind). Racing dinghies and skiffs tend to be lighter, have more sail area, and may use a trapeze to allow one or both crewmembers to suspend themselves over the water for additional stability.
**Larger trailerable sailboats include trailer sailers, which have enclosed accommodation, and sportboats which are optimised for speed. 
**Daysailers tend to be wider across the beam and have greater accommodation space at the expense of speed.
**Cruising sailboats have more width, but performance climbs as they tend to be much longer with a starting over-all length of at least re-balancing the dynamic ratio between length of waterline (aiding speed) and beam width (adding cargo and people space).
*Freshwater fishing boats account for approximately 1/3 of all registered boats in the U.S., and most all other types of boats end up being used as fishing boats on occasion. The boating industry has developed freshwater fishing boat designs that are species-specific to allow anglers the greatest advantage when fishing for walleye, salmon, trout, bass, etcetera, as well as generic fishing craft.
*Watersport Boats or skiboats are high-powered &quot;Go-Fast&quot; boats (specialized towboats in fact) is designed for activities where a participant is towed behind the boat such as waterskiing and parasailing.
**Variations on the ubiquitous waterski include wakeboards, water-skiing, kneeboarding, inflatable towables, and wake surfing. To some degree, the nature of these boating activities influences boat design. Waterski boats are intended to hold a precise course at an accurate speed with a flat wake for slalom skiing runs. Wakeboard boats run at slower speeds, and have various methods including ballast and negative lift foils to force the stern in the water, thereby creating a large and &quot;jumpable&quot; wake.
**Saltwater fishing boats vary widely in length and are once again specialized for various species of fish. Flats boats, for example, are used in protected, shallow waters, and have shallow draft. Sportfishing boats range from or more, and can be powered by large outboard engines or inboard diesels. Fishing boats in colder climates may have more space dedicated to cuddy cabins and wheelhouses, while boats in warmer climates are likely to be entirely open.
**Cruising boats applies to both power and sailboats, and refers to trips from local weekend passages to lengthy voyages, and is a lifestyle. While faster &quot;express cruisers&quot; can be used for multiple day trips, long voyages generally require a slower displacement boat (trawler) with diesel power and greater stability and efficiency. Cruising sailboats range from and more, and have easily managed sail plans to allow relatively small crews to sail them long distances. Some cruising sailboats will have two masts (ketch, yawl, or schooner rigs) to further reduce the size of individual sails and make it possible for a couple to handle larger boats. Diesel- (now sometimes electric-) powered Narrowboats are a very popular mode of travel (and accommodation) on the inland waterways of England.
*Racing and regattas are common group activities in the sub-culture of boaters owning larger (twenty-five foot plus) small boats and larger yachts, and are frequently organized around a yacht club or marina organization
**Sailboat racing can be done on conventional family sailboats racing under one of the simpler handicap formulas (PHRF, or Performance Handicap Rating Formula is one such rule), or can be done on specialized boats with virtually no accommodation or compromises for comfort. Racing is generally either one design, where the boats are close to identical, or handicapped where the boats&#x27; finishing times are adjusted based on their predicted speed potential. Racing is further broken down into ocean racing, where boats start at one port and race in the ocean and back to the same port or a new destination, or buoy racing where boats race around prescribed courses and return to port at night. Several famous races cross oceans, like the biennial Transpac Race from Los Angeles to Honolulu, or the Newport-Bermuda Race from Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda. Other races actually circumnavigate the globe, like the Volvo Ocean Race or Vendee Globe race.

==Anchoring==

Anchoring a boat is essential to recreational boaters by giving them the ability to &quot;park&quot; their boat in the water. Anchoring is helpful to boaters who fish or swim off of their boat and provides a stable and established site to achieve whatever activity is being done. Anchoring a boat is also critical in emergency situations and is a good safety measure whenever a vessel becomes disabled. There are three types of anchors, the Plow-style, the Fluke-style, and the Mushroom anchor.
*Plow-style is the most effective for most boats especially larger boats (over ). It receives its holding power by plowing into the bottom sediments using the boats mass to drag it underneath the soil.
*Fluke-style or Danforth anchor is similar to the plow anchor but is more lightweight. This anchor is commonly used on boats smaller than but is very effective by using its pointed flukes to bury into the sediment below.
*Mushroom anchors are designed for situations which require a permanent anchor with strong holding power. The weight of a mushroom anchor causes it to be slowly buried under soft sediment, giving significant holding power and are typically used for moorings, buoys, and other permanent anchoring needs. Mushroom anchors are not carried on a boat for use as a temporary or short term anchor. Initially there is no holding power due to the significant amount of time required for the anchor to settle and bury itself in the sediment.

A rope anchor line should be at least four times longer than the depth of the water in the anchorage. A seven to eight foot chain should also be attached between the rope and the anchor in order to reduce the angle of the pull on the anchor facilitated by the chain sinking and lying on the bottom. This is important because in order for the anchor to be effective, the pull must be at a shallow angle rather than vertically. A vertical pull on the anchor will result in the anchor breaking out of the bottom sediment and is used as a technique to break the anchor&#x27;s hold allowing the anchor to be raised in order to leave the anchorage.

The anchor should never be dragged behind a boat or dropped at the stern. This could result in the boat being or filled with water. Tie off the anchor to a bow cleat and pull on it to make sure that the knot is secure. After that make sure the vessel is down wind or down current of the anchor. After anchoring it is important to check visual sightings and onshore objects or buoys to let the driver know if his boat is secure by the anchor. The anchor will help boaters to stay in their current position on the water.

==Transport and storage==
The smallest boats and kayaks may simply be carried by hand or by lashing them to the top of an automobile. Most smaller boats are stored at home and carried to the water on boat trailers, where they are floated from launch ramps leading down into the water. Some marinas will also offer electric hoists that can lift a boat from a trailer and swing it into the water (generally less than 6 tons). Larger boats are kept at marinas, which offer a berth protected from the weather and a variety of support services, such as fuel and equipment.

A more recent form of storage is rack storage where runabouts are stored in large steel racks, sometimes four or five boats high, and perhaps 25 boats across. These racks are housed in sheds, and large specialized fork trucks are used to lift the boats from the racks and place them in the water. This reduces the amount of space needed for boat storage, and also provides a clean environment in which the boats are housed.
Some marinas will offer dry storage yards, where boats on trailers or dollies are stored on a hard surface. Many yacht clubs will offer a fenced area where boats are conveniently stored near the water, but without the maintenance associated with continual water storage (bottom growth, etc.) Boats in dry storage areas are either ramp-launched or hoisted into the water.

==Safety==
Since it is a recreational activity, most boating is done in calm protected waters and during good weather. Even so, conditions can change rapidly, and a small vessel can get into life-threatening difficulties. It&#x27;s important to keep an inventory of safety gear on board every boat, which is prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard as well as state boating law administrators in the U.S. Depending on the size of the boat and how it is powered, required equipment may include:

* personal flotation devices or life jackets for everyone on board
* a throwable flotation device (in the U.S., a type IV personal flotation device)
* navigation lights suitable for the type of boat operation
* visual distress signals which are effective both day and night
* sound-making devices including horns and bells
* fire 
* a copy of the Inland Rules of the Road
* a VHF or long range radio
Other items might seem obvious but are not actually required by law. They include a flashlight, first aid kit, paddles, whistles, anchor and rope, engine spare parts, bilge pumps, a VHF radio or mobile phone, etc.

In addition to these safety items listed above, the Code of Federal Regulations lists some additional required items that may not fall into the common definition of &quot;safety&quot; items:
* backfire arresters on gasoline-powered vessels
* ventilation systems on gasoline-powered vessels
* plaques which list the penalties associated with pollution due to oil discharge, or dumping trash overboard
* a marine sanitation system (marine sanitation device) which prevents water pollution from sewage

State laws may add to this list of requirements. Most of the differences fall into a few categories:
* laws requiring life jackets to be worn in specific activities or by children
* upgraded life jackets for specific activities or by children
* restrictions on the types of marine sanitation devices that are allowed within state borders

In the United States, more than 40 states have educational requirements for operating a boat or personal watercraft on state waters. Laws vary by state so it&#x27;s best to check the laws of your state. Boater education courses can be taken in-person classroom style or online at the student&#x27;s convenience. Credible courses are recognized by the US Coast Guard, approved by NASBLA and work in conjunction with state agencies.

All pleasure craft operators in Canada are required to have a proof of competency (something that shows they understand the basic rules and how to safely operate a boat). A Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC) is the most common proof of competency and it can be obtained by taking an online course and a Transport Canada exam.

===Personal flotation devices===
Recreational boating deaths could be dramatically reduced with increased use of personal flotation devices or life jackets. Wear rates in 2003 were around 22.4%, although state and federal laws requiring children to wear flotation were more common, and therefore children&#x27;s wear rates were much higher than those for adults. Relatively few children die in boating accidents; the more likely victim is an adult male in the mid-afternoon in a boat (under 20 feet length overall) who is not wearing a personal flotation device.

While various strategies have been devised in the last few decades to increase personal flotation device wear rates, the observed rate has been relatively constant. This has led to the possibility of legislation requiring personal flotation device usage on boats under a specified length when underway.

Personal watercraft have increased in popularity for the last 15 years, and account for about 70 fatalities per year (2002). However, operators of personal watercraft commonly wear personal flotation devices, and therefore have a relatively low incidence of drowning. Trauma, largely due to collisions with other vessels and the shoreline, accounts for 70% of personal watercraft fatalities while drowning accounts for about 30%.

Personal flotation device types as defined by the U.S. Coast Guard such as Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV, and Type V can be found at the U.S. Coast Guard. In the U.S., one personal flotation device MUST be available for everyone on board. Life jacket definitions for the UK Coast Guard. In 2014, the U.S. Coast Guard announced a new labeling system for personal flotation devices, aiming to align US and Canadian standards. This new labeling system is now being introduced as the older type I-V personal flotation device labels are being phased out.

===Drowning===

In the United States, approximately 700 people die every year as a result of recreational boating accidents, according to the Boating Accident Reporting Database, published annually by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Alcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012. A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a &quot;true figure&quot; of alcohol-related deaths in that country &quot;may lie between 46% and 56%&quot;.

Since 1970, when recreational boating deaths in the U.S. peaked at about 1700 per year, the annual rate of fatalities has been declining at a rate of about 2% per year. The majority of these deaths (70%) occur due to drowning, and are frequently associated with small powerboat accidents. Other causes of death include trauma (especially with small powerboats), fire, carbon monoxide poisoning, and hypothermia.

The cause of the reduction of deaths is subject to some debate, but the Federal Boat Safety Act in the 1970s (effective August 10, 1971) required that boats under be equipped with level flotation. This change in boat construction meant that boaters who found themselves in the water next to a swamped boat could climb back into the boat and both reduce their likelihood of drowning, while increasing the size of a search target and reducing hypothermia. Other frequently named causes include improved boater safety education, increased use of life jackets, and improved boating safety gear.

Another potential cause for drowning is the presence of stray electrical power from a boat leaking into the water. This is known as electric shock drowning. Metal surfaces of a boat leaking power into the water can create zones of high-energy potential. Stray current entering salt water is less of a problem than the same situation in fresh water. Salt water is a good conductor and it carries current away to ground quickly. Fresh water is a poor conductor and when alternating current forms an electrical potential near a boat, the current can paralyze a swimmer. Because electrical drownings frequently present no obvious signs of injury, post-mortem examinations often fail to identify electrical shock as the cause of death. The problem can be reduced by prohibiting swimming near boats connected to shore power and ensuring marinas comply with National Fire Protection Association Standard 303 for marinas.

===Carbon monoxide===
In the early 2000s, several high-profile deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning (CO) led to increased scrutiny of boating habits (especially the practice of towing participants immediately behind a boat, known as &quot;teak surfing&quot; or &quot;platform towing&quot;) and the implementation of various warning placards to educate boaters of the hazards arising from these activities. Other CO-related deaths were attributed to high concentrations of CO gas from houseboat generator exhaust, where swimmers were able to access an area near the stern of the boats that collected the exhaust. This has led to improved pollution controls on modern generator sets, and changes in the designs of houseboats so that they discharge exhaust gases in a way that they can dissipate. The increased use of CO detectors, especially in boats with enclosed accommodation spaces, and a proper assessment of boat manufacturers, would help reduce the risk of CO poisoning.

==Licensing==
Depending on the country, boating on coastal waters and inland waters may require a licence. Usually, commercially boating on coastal waters almost always requires a licence, while recreational boating on coastal waters only requires a licence when a certain boat size is exceeded (e.g. a length of 20 meters), or when passenger ships, ferries or tugboats are steered. Boating on international waters does not require any licence, due to the absence of any laws or restrictions in this area. Some of the member states of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe issue the International Certificate of Competence. The International Sailing License and Credentials (SLC) is a recreational sailing license valid for all yacht charter companies worldwide including Europe and the Seychelles.

<text>Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae. The species have a pantropical distribution. The generic name is derived from &quot;sophera&quot;, an Arabic name for a pea-flowered tree.

The genus formerly had a broader interpretation including many other species now treated in other genera, notably &quot;Styphnolobium&quot; (pagoda tree genus), which differs in lacking nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) on the roots, and &quot;Dermatophyllum&quot; (the mescalbeans). &quot;Styphnolobium&quot; has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast &quot;Sophora&quot; contains arabinogalactans, and &quot;Dermatophyllum&quot; amylose.

The New Zealand &quot;Sophora&quot; species are known as kowhai.

The seeds of species such as &quot;Sophora affinis&quot; and &quot;Sophora chrysophylla&quot; are reported to be poisonous.

<text>The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is the process established in 2003 to prevent &quot;conflict diamonds&quot; from entering the mainstream rough diamond market by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 55/56 following recommendations in the Fowler Report. The process was set up &quot;to ensure that diamond purchases were not financing violence by rebel movements and their allies seeking to undermine legitimate governments&quot;.

The effectiveness of the process has been brought into question by organizations such as Global Witness (pulled out of the scheme on 5 December 2011) and IMPACT (pulled out on 14 December 2017), claiming it has failed in its purpose and does not provide markets with assurance that the diamonds are not conflict diamonds.

Organizations such as Human Rights Watch have also argued that the Kimberley Process is too narrow in scope and does not adequately serve to eliminate other human rights concerns from the diamond production chain.

In 2022, members debated whether Russian diamonds were conflict diamonds.

Administration and funding of the KPCS has been an ongoing question. Until 2011, there was no formal funding mechanism for KPCS administrative expenses, with some expenses borne by member countries and others borne by the country holding the chair position in a given year. In 2011, the KPCS Administrative Support Mechanism was approved to handle administrative tasks, supported by four industry organizations. In 2022, members voted to make Botswana the host of the Permanent Secretariat for KPCS, with costs shared by Botswana, as well as the World Diamond Council and KPCS member countries.

==History==
The United Nations imposed sanctions against UNITA in 1998 through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173, however investigators led by Robert Fowler presented the Fowler Report to the UN in March 2000, which detailed how the movement was able to continue financing its war efforts through the sale of diamonds on the international market. The UN wished to clamp down on this sanctions-breaking trade, but had limited powers of enforcement; the Fowler report therefore set out to name the countries, companies, government and individuals involved. This led to a meeting of diamond-producing and trading states from around the world in Kimberley, Northern Cape in May 2000. A culminating ministerial meeting followed during September in Pretoria, from which the KPCS originated.

In December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/55/56, supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds, and this was followed by support from the United Nations Security Council in its Resolution 1459 passed in January 2003. Every year since, the General Assembly has renewed its support for the KP – most recently in March 2018.

In order for a country to be a participant, it must ensure that any diamond originating from the country does not finance a rebel group or other entity seeking to overthrow a UN-recognized government, that every diamond export be accompanied by a Kimberley Process certificate and that no diamond is imported from, or exported to, a non-member of the scheme. This three-step plan is a simple description of the steps taken to ensure a chain of countries that deal exclusively with non-conflict diamonds. By restricting diamond revenues to government-approved sources, the Kimberley Process is neutral towards different governments.

===World Diamond Council involvement===

The World Diamond Council is an industry trade group representing the diamond supply chain including representatives from diamond mining, manufacturing, trading and retail. It was established in response to concerns about blood diamonds. It was established in July 2000 in Antwerp, Belgium after a joint meeting of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses, representing all the world&#x27;s significant diamond trading centres, and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association, representing significant manufacturers. Its stated purpose is &quot;to represent the diamond industry in the
development and implementation of regulatory and voluntary systems to control the trade in diamonds embargoed by the United Nations or covered by the KPCS.&quot;

By November 2002, negotiations between governments, the international diamond industry and civil society organisations resulted in the creation of the KPCS. The KPCS document set out the requirements for controlling rough diamond production and trade.

The KPCS is credited as being instrumental toward dramatically reducing “conflict diamonds” to less than 1% of the world&#x27;s diamond production today.

The World Diamond Council has representation on all the Kimberley Process&#x27;s working groups and is influential in determining its implementation and future reform.

==Compliance==

===System of warranties===
The World Diamond Council created a System of Warranties for diamonds that has been endorsed by all KPCS participants. Under this system, all buyers and sellers of both rough and polished diamonds must make the following affirmative statement on all invoices:

It is considered a violation of the KPCS to issue a warranty declaration on a sales invoice unless it can be corroborated by warranty invoices received for purchases. Each company trading in diamonds must also keep records of the warranty invoices received and the warranty invoices issued when buying or selling diamonds. This flow of warranties in and out must be audited and reconciled on an annual basis by the company&#x27;s auditors.

In addition, the diamond industry organizations and their members have adopted the following principles of self-regulation:
* to trade only with companies that include warranty declarations on their invoices;
* to not buy diamonds from suspect sources or unknown suppliers, or which originate in countries that have not implemented the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme;
* to not buy diamonds from any sources that, after a legally binding due process system, have been found to have violated government regulations restricting the trade in conflict diamonds;
* to not buy diamonds in or from any region that is subject to an advisory by a governmental authority indicating that conflict diamonds are emanating from or available for sale in such region, unless diamonds have been exported from such region in compliance with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme;
* to not knowingly buy or sell or assist others to buy or sell conflict diamonds;
* to ensure that all company employees that buy or sell diamonds within the diamond trade are well informed regarding trade resolutions and government regulations restricting the trade in conflict diamonds.

Failure to abide by these principles exposes the member to expulsion from industry organizations.

==Working procedure==
The working procedure of the KPCS is done by the chair, elected on an annual basis at a plenary meeting. A working group on monitoring, works to ensure that each participant is implementing the scheme correctly. The working group reports to the chair. Other working groups include the technical working group (or working group of diamond experts) which reports on difficulties in implementation and proposes solutions, and the statistics working group, which reports diamond trading data.

While the process has been broadly welcomed by groups aiming to improve human rights in countries previously affected by conflict diamonds, such as Angola, some say it does not go far enough. For instance, Amnesty International says &quot;[We] welcome the Kimberley Process as an important step to dealing with the problem of conflict diamonds. But until the diamond trade is subject to mandatory, impartial monitoring, there is still no effective guarantee that all conflict diamonds will be identified and removed from the market.&quot; Canadian aid group One Sky (funded in part by the Canadian government) concurs with Amnesty&#x27;s view saying &quot;If effectively implemented, the Kimberley Process will ensure that diamonds cannot be used to finance war and atrocities... However, without a system of expert, independent and periodic reviews of all countries, the overall process remains open to abuse.&quot; Fatal Transactions campaign&#x27;s (started in 1998) founder Anne Jung in 2008 criticized KPCS for not being a legally binding agreement and suggested a revision of the scheme.

Another form of criticism by the African Diamond Council (ADC) is whether the Kimberley Process is realistically enforceable. There are many factors that can jeopardize the &quot;Officialdom of certificates and paperwork&quot; from lack of enforcement on the ground to the secrecy in the diamond trading centers such as Antwerp. Human Rights Watch has also found that there is little independent monitoring of compliance with the Kimberley Process, and few penalties for violations.

===Working groups===
KPCS has established a number of working groups for carrying out its programs. As of 2019, it had seven working groups: Working Group of Diamond Experts (WGDE), Working Group on Monitoring (WGM), Working Group on Statistics (WGS), Working Group on Artisanal &amp; Alluvial Production (WGAAP), Committee on Participation and Chairmanship (CPC), Committee on Rules and Procedures (CRP) and Ad Hoc Committee on Reform and Review (AHCRR).

==Current membership==
As of 1 July 2013, there were 54 participants in the KPCS representing 81 countries, with the European Union counting as a single participant. The participants include all major rough diamond producing, exporting and importing countries. Cameroon, Kazakhstan, Panama, and Cambodia were admitted as participants in 2012.

===Waiver===
The World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2006 approved a waiver for the KPCS while recognizing the importance and effectiveness of the KPCS.

==Chairs==
The following is a list of the Kimberly Process Certification Scheme&#x27;s chairs and vice chairs. The chair oversees the implementation of the program, the operations of the working groups and committees, and general administration. The chair rotates annually. The current chair of KPCS is the nation that held the position of vice chair the previous year.

* 2003: South Africa; vice chair Canada
* 2004: Canada; vice chair Russian Federation
* 2005: Russian Federation; vice chair Botswana
* 2006: Botswana; vice chair European Commission
* 2007: European Commission; vice chair India
* 2008: India; vice chair Namibia
* 2009: Namibia; vice chair Israel
* 2010: Israel, Mr. Boaz Hirsch; vice chair DRC
* 2011: DRC, Mr. Mathieu Yamba; vice chair United States
* 2012: United States, Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic; vice chair South Africa
* 2013: South Africa, vice chair China
* 2014: China, vice chair Angola
* 2015: Angola, vice chair United Arab Emirates
* 2016: United Arab Emirates, vice chair Australia
* 2017: Australia, vice chair European Union
* 2018: European Union, vice chair India
* 2019: India, vice chair Russian Federation
* 2020: No chairmanship due to Covid-19
* 2021: Russian Federation, vice chair Botswana
* 2022: Botswana, vice chair Zimbabwe

The DRC&#x27;s position as the 2011 KPCS chair is notable, in that it had been a known source of conflict diamonds and other minerals in recent years.

==Statistics==
KPCS emphasizes collecting and publishing data relating to actual mining and international trade in diamonds. Member countries are required to officially submit statistics that can be verified through audit. Also, all member countries are required to produce and submit an Annual Report on the trade in diamonds. According to the Working Group on Statistics (WGS) of KPCS, in 2006, the KPCS monitored $35.7 billion in rough diamond exports representing more than 480 million carats. The number of Certificates issued by KPCS members was 55,000.

In 2014, 100 Reporters published an article showing how the use of KP certificates had allowed for the publication to identify transfer pricing manipulation in South Africa&#x27;s trade of rough diamond exports, detailing &quot;Most imported diamonds appear to be re-exported uncut and unpolished. While imports make up relatively small volume, or carats, they drastically increase the value of rough diamond exports. Subtracting the values and volume of imported diamonds shown on South Africa&#x27;s K.P. certificates from corresponding exports, the actual price per carat of rough diamonds being exported for the first time falls dramatically.&quot;

The article revealed that when, &quot;asked about the anomalies in reported trade figures for diamonds under the Kimberley Process (K.P.) in South Africa, where De Beers is a dominant player, [Lynette] Gould, [head of media relations for De Beers], responded, &quot;The primary purpose of the K.P. process (or the issuing of the certificates at least) is for Governments to certify the origin of diamonds, not to keep track of the volume and value of diamonds imported or exported.&quot;

===Annual report===
Annual report by all KPCS members is a component of peer review mechanism established by KPCS. In the United States, for example, all companies that buy, sell, and ship rough diamonds must submit an annual report via email to the State Department, deadline April 1. The report must include the company&#x27;s contact information and a detailed breakdown of the total carat weight and value in U.S. dollars of rough diamonds imported, exported, and stockpiled (still in inventory) for the previous calendar year. These are also sorted by HTS codes for unsorted (gem and industrial) rough diamonds, sorted rough industrial diamonds, and sorted rough gem diamonds – the latter of which is most likely to be polished into finished stones and jewelry for retail sale, while industrial diamonds are most likely to be used in cutting and drilling tools. Failure to submit this annual report in a timely fashion could result in a fine up to $10,000. If found to be in willful violation, the convicted offender could be fined up to $50,000 and sentenced to up to ten years in prison.

==Expulsion==
In 2004, Republic of the Congo was removed from the scheme because it was found unable to prove the origin of its gems, most of which were believed to have come from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. For countries economically dependent on diamond exports, this can be a substantial punishment, as it disallows trade with much of the rest of the world. Republic of the Congo&#x27;s membership in the KPCS was reinstated in the Plenary of 2007.

In 2005, trade in diamonds from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire was prohibited. Ivorian diamonds and cocoa are considered conflict resources.

In 2008, Venezuela voluntarily removed itself from the KPCS, after it had been in non-compliance for several years. The nation ignored several attempts to communicate from Kimberley working groups, finally responding to an Angolan ambassador in 2007. Venezuela invited Kimberley officials to visit the nation, but this required authorization, and the deadline expired without further correspondence. Finally, Venezuela agreed to remove itself from the KPCS and work toward strengthening its infrastructure.

Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Venezuela are still considered Kimberley Process members, but not Kimberley Process participants. As explained in the FAQ section of the Kimberley Process website, &quot;Participants in the Kimberley Process (KP) are states or regional economic integration organisations (currently the European Community) that have met the minimum requirements of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) and are, therefore, eligible to trade in rough diamonds with one another. The KPCS prohibits participants from trading with non-participants. Therefore, while the aforementioned countries still retain membership in the KPCS, they do not fulfill the requirements for participation, and thus cannot be called &quot;participants&quot;.

==Global Witness==
Global Witness is a London-based NGO, a key member of the KPCS and was one of the first organizations to bring the issue of &#x27;conflict diamonds&#x27; to international attention. They state that a report they wrote, &quot;A Rough Trade&quot;, was partial inspiration for the film &quot;Blood Diamond&quot;.

According to Global Witness, the Kimberley Process has ultimately failed to stem the flow of conflict diamonds, leading them to abandon the scheme in 2011.

==Criticism==
In December 2013, the &quot;World Policy Journal&quot; published an investigative report by journalists Khadija Sharife and John Grobler. This showed that a minimum of $3.5 billion in KP-certified diamonds from Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) had been moved through KP-certified tax havens such as Dubai and Switzerland. This was in collaboration with self-regulating &#x27;KP-approved&#x27; governments including Angola; arms dealers such as Arkadi Gaydamak, diamond magnate Lev Leviev and certain international banks.

The authors concluded that tax havens should not be allowed to handle resource revenues because they provide &quot;the legal and financial-secrecy infrastructure enabling illicit activities, while the former struggle to generate revenue for citizens&#x27; needs&quot;. Under-invoicing and other illicit manipulation of reported income or tax avoidance were excluded from the definition of &quot;conflict diamond&quot; used by the KP, they note, and this &quot;has enabled a 99 percent clean diamond industry to exist largely because the real violence of the industry is whitewashed, ignored, or excluded entirely from the frameworkthe criminal portion of which continues to exist entirely on the periphery.&quot;

In 2013, US investigative platform 100 Reporters released another Khadija Sharife investigate through Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) documents, showing $3 billion in diamond revenues used to rig the Zimbabwean elections.

In June 2009, Ian Smillie of the Canadian-based NGO, Partnership Africa Canada (PAC), one of the founder members of the Kimberley Process resigned his position accusing the regulator of failing to regulate and saying he could no longer contribute to the &quot;pretense that failure is success&quot;.

Another founding member of the process, UK-based NGO Global Witness said, &quot;Despite having all tools in place, the Scheme was failing effectively to address issues of non-compliance, smuggling, money laundering and human rights abuses in the world&#x27;s... diamond fields&quot;. The scheme came under further criticism from Global Witness and Partnership Africa Canada in June 2010 after the Kimberley Monitor appointed to review diamond mining conditions in Zimbabwe recommended that the country be allowed to sell diamonds as conflict-free from its contested Marange diamond fields in Chiadzwa. For the first time the two NGOs jointly called for a redefined classification for conflict diamonds.

In August 2010, another key draftsman of the KP, and also Africa&#x27;s highest-ranking diamond official, African Diamond Council (ADC) and ADPA chairman Dr. M&#x27;zée Fula Ngenge, demoralized KP supporters by persuading African diamond-producing nations to renounce their support for the scheme. Ngenge blasted the KP for its ongoing ineffectiveness, stating that &quot;the system has failed to thwart trading of diamonds mined as a result of human suffering.&quot;

Ahead of this denunciation, the ADC unleashed a distressing TV infomercial that exposed internal problems at the front end of the African diamond industry. The broadcast was not only a huge boost for the ADC, it proved to be an enormous setback for the Kimberley Process and ultimately ended De Beers’ ascendancy on the African continent.

In December 2010 &quot;Time Magazine&quot; published a piece discussing the newly established rough diamond trade in Zimbabwe. The article questioned the legitimacy of the Kimberley Process, stating that it was unable to prevent Zimbabwean conflict diamonds from entering the market.

On 11 August 2011, a BBC radio documentary titled &quot;Zimbabwe&#x27;s Diamond Fields&quot; repeated an interview with representatives of the Kimberley Process claiming officials were unaware of the tortures and killings exposed in the documentary. Official stated they were only aware of incidents uncovered by their brief visits to the field, implying that they were not staffed to do in-depth investigations.

Global Witness walked out on KP in December 2011. The human rights group has stated that in recent times, the governments of Zimbabwe, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Venezuela have all dishonored, breached and exploited the system without bearing any consequential penalties for their infringements.

<text>William Alexander Lange (; June 6, 1871 – July 23, 1950), also known as &quot;Little Eva&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball center fielder, who played his entire seven-year career for the Chicago Colts and Orphans from to . During his time in the Majors, he once led the National League in stolen bases, and was among the seasonal leaders in several other offensive categories including home runs, and batting average.

Lange was noted for having a combination of great speed and power, especially for his size. His , frame was considered large for his era. He is best known for retiring from baseball during the prime of his career to get married, as his future father-in-law forbade his daughter to marry a baseball player. Despite the short-lived marriage, he refused all offers to return as a player.

He became a successful businessman after his retirement from baseball. In addition to his success in real estate and insurance, he became a leading figure in Major League Baseball&#x27;s efforts to generate interest in the game worldwide. He was enlisted by the leading baseball figures of the day to assist in establishing leagues in several European countries, that could eventually compete against American teams, while also scouting for undiscovered talent.

==Early life==
Born in the Presidio District of San Francisco, California, he ran away from home while still in grammar school to live with his brother in Port Townsend, Washington. It was from there that he moved up to play Minor League Baseball for the Seattle Reds of the Northwestern Baseball League in the early 1890s. When the Northwestern League folded, Lange return the Bay area to play for the Oakland Colonels of the California League. He played one season for the Colonels, then was signed by the Chicago Colts of the National League.

==Major League career==
Lange made his Major League debut on April 27, for the Colts, and enjoyed a successful inaugural Major League season. He scored 92 times, hit eight home runs, had 88 runs batted in (RBIs), while also finishing seventh in stolen bases with 47, and batted .281. This was the only time he batted under .300 during his Major League career. In the field that season, he played at second base, in right field and center field. He did not start playing center field exclusively until the following season. Lange continued his success in by raising his batting average to .328 and finishing fifth in the league with 65 stolen bases.

Lange achieved his highest league rankings in . His .389 batting average was fifth in the league and is still the top individual season average in Chicago Cubs history. He also finished second in the league in stolen bases with 67, fifth in home runs with 10, fifth in on-base percentage with .456, hit 16 triples, scored 120 runs, and batted in 98 RBIs.

Lange had several notable moments during the season. On July 4, he stole five bases in one game against the Louisville Colonels, although it was two stolen bases short of the record of seven set by George Gore and Billy Hamilton. During a game on August 31, he entered baseball lore with a feat that he never actually performed. The game was scoreless in the bottom of the 10th inning when Lange made a diving catch in center field to keep the game scoreless. Later in the inning, Chicago&#x27;s first baseman, George Decker attempted to field a thrown ball from third baseman Barry McCormick, but it bounced off and broke his wrist instead. In an effort to get Decker to the hospital adjacent the ballpark, his teammates knocked down several wooden slats of the outfield fence to expedite his journey. However, the two events were confused and it became legend that Lange had crashed through the fence making that acrobatic catch in tenth. Lange finished the season with a .326 batting average, while also stealing 84 bases, second in the league, and finished eighth in league with 16 triples.

His success continued into the season, as he batted .340, scored 119 runs, and led the league in stolen bases for the only time in his career. His production dropped his last two seasons in the Majors as his runs scored fell to 79 in and 81 in , although he still kept his batting averages of .319 and .325 respectively.

While he was very popular, his career as a baseball player was not without controversy. He was ejected from a game on at least two occasions, one of which occurred on May 23, when he had an on-field fight with Washington Senators second baseman John O&#x27;Brien. On September 16, 1899, in a game against the Brooklyn Superbas, umpire Ed Swartwood called the game because of darkness with Brooklyn up by two runs. Lange, and other Chicago player surrounded Swartwood and proceeded to &quot;knock him around&quot;, with Lange notably &quot;tweaking&quot; the umpire&#x27;s ear.

==Retirement==
Lange finished his career on October 15, 1899, having announced a few days earlier his intention to retire after the season. His team played a doubleheader that day, winning 7–0 against the St. Louis Perfectos, then losing to the Louisville Colonels later that day in a game shortened by darkness.

He retired from the game at age 28, during the prime of his career, so he could marry a woman whose father forbade her to marry a baseball player. In the eyes of the 19th century public, baseball players were popular, but were often looked upon as low class. Lange&#x27;s future wife was from his hometown of San Francisco, and her family was very well-to-do. Also, with the prospect of entering into the world of real estate and insurance, he could make much more money than he did as a ball player. Though the marriage ended in a divorce a short time later, he would not take any offers to return to Major League Baseball, despite Chicago&#x27;s salary offer of $3,500 that would have made him the highest paid player in the league. Although his career lasted only seven years, he finished as the decade leader among 1890s Chicago players in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and stolen bases.

In 813 games over seven seasons, Lange posted a .330 batting average (1056-for-3202) with 691 runs, 39 home runs, 579 RBI, 400 stolen bases and 350 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .932 fielding percentage.

==Post-career==
Lange became successful in both real estate and insurance in his hometown of San Francisco after he retired from baseball. Lange is also credited in several sources, as being the person who discovered future Chicago Cubs first baseman, manager, and Hall of Famer, Frank Chance, after having watched him play for the local Fresno, California team during the off-season of 1897. Lange had recommended Chance to the team owner, Jim Hart, but Hart disputed this claim, saying that Henry Harris had recommended Chance to him while Harris was an owner of a San Francisco team in the fall of 1897.

In , the California State League, a minor league, was declared by organized baseball to be an &quot;outlaw&quot; league. Organized baseball accused the league of harboring players from the Majors Leagues who had violated the reserve clause to join a number of their teams. The league had become a rival to the already established Pacific Coast League (PCL), who, after being an &quot;outlaw&quot; league themselves, had signed the National Agreement with organized baseball, agreeing that they would not harbor blacklisted or banned players from the Major Leagues. The National Commission decided that the best way to deal with this situation was to dissolve this outlaw league. They did this by lifting the blacklist on any player already in the State League, which would create competition among all known leagues, for these players. This commission enlisted Lange, who used his influence with the sports editors in the local area to speed up the process. The attempt worked as the PCL successfully lured the Sacramento, California team into joining their league, with many of the players soon to follow.

Later, John McGraw of the New York Giants enlisted Lange as his chief European baseball scout, hoping to discover any hidden talent in that untapped market. In , Ban Johnson, the American League president enlisted Lange as his chief organizer of baseball teams in Europe, mainly in England, France, Belgium, and Italy. Johnson&#x27;s plan was for Lange to evaluate talent and establish an International Baseball League that could compete against the American League pennant winning team in an effort to generate greater interest in the game. Lange became part of the board of directors at the YMCA, which helped fund the expedition. Additionally, Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith donated $40,000 worth of equipment to assist in supplying the new league.

Lange died at the age of 79 in his hometown of San Francisco, and is interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. Two of his nephews played Major League ball as well, Ren, and George &quot;Highpockets&quot; Kelly. George later gained induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in .

<text>In the United Kingdom, taxation may involve payments to at least three different levels of government: central government (HM Revenue and Customs), devolved governments and local government. Central government revenues come primarily from income tax, National Insurance contributions, value added tax, corporation tax and fuel duty. Local government revenues come primarily from grants from central government funds, business rates in England, Council Tax and increasingly from fees and charges such as those for on-street parking. In the fiscal year 2023–24, total government revenue was forecast to be £1,139.1 billion, or 40.9 per cent of GDP, with income taxes and National Insurance contributions standing at around £470 billion.

==History==

A uniform Land Tax, originally introduced in England during the late 17th century, formed the main source of government revenue throughout the 18th century and the early 19th century.

===Napoleonic wars===
Income tax was announced in Britain by William Pitt the Younger in his budget of December 1798 and introduced in 1799, to pay for weapons and equipment in preparation for the Napoleonic Wars. Pitt&#x27;s new graduated (progressive) income tax began at a levy of 2 old pence in the pound () on annual incomes over £60 (equivalent to £ as of ), and increased up to a maximum of 2 shillings (10 per cent) on annual incomes of over £200. Pitt hoped that the new income tax would raise £10 million, but receipts for 1799 totalled just over £6 million.

Income tax was levied under five schedules. Income not falling within those schedules was not taxed. The schedules were:
* Schedule A (tax on income from United Kingdom land)
* Schedule B (tax on commercial occupation of land)
* Schedule C (tax on income from public securities)
* Schedule D (tax on trading income, income from professions and vocations, interest, overseas income and casual income)
* Schedule E (tax on employment income)

Later, Schedule F (tax on United Kingdom dividend income) was added.

Pitt&#x27;s income tax was levied from 1799 to 1802, when it was abolished by Henry Addington during the Peace of Amiens. Addington had taken over as prime minister in 1801. The income tax was reintroduced by Addington in 1803 when hostilities recommenced, but it was again abolished in 1816, one year after the Battle of Waterloo.

Considerable controversy was aroused by the malt, house, windows and income taxes. The malt tax was easy to collect from brewers; even after it was reduced in 1822, it produced over 10 per cent of government&#x27;s annual revenues through the 1840s. The house tax mostly hit London town houses; the windows tax mostly hit country manors.

===Peel&#x27;s income tax===
The income tax was reintroduced by Sir Robert Peel in the Income Tax Act 1842. Peel, as a Conservative, had opposed income tax in the 1841 general election, but a growing budget deficit required a new source of funds. The new income tax of 7d in the pound (about 2.9%), based on Addington&#x27;s model, was imposed on annual incomes above £150 (equivalent to £ as of ).

===Provisional Collection of Taxes Acts===
The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1913 (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. 3), replaced later by the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, authorised collection of taxes on the basis of a Budget resolution passed by the House of Commons, in advance of subsequent legislation implementing the budget.

===First World War===
The war (1914–1918) was financed by borrowing large sums at home and abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, and canceling capital expenditure. The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. There was a strong emphasis on being &quot;fair&quot; and being &quot;scientific&quot;. The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50% on profits above the normal pre-war level; the rate was raised to 80% in 1917. Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from the income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate increased to 5s. (25%) in 1916, and 6s. (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30% of national expenditure, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid 5% p.a. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased in 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.

===Modern rules===
Business rates were introduced in England and Wales in 1990 and are a modernised version of a system of rating that dates back to the Poor Relief Act 1601. As such, business rates retain many previous features from, and follow some case law of, older forms of rating. The Finance Act 2004 introduced an income tax regime known as &quot;pre-owned asset tax&quot; which aims to reduce the use of common methods of inheritance tax avoidance.

Britain&#x27;s income tax has changed over the years. Originally it taxed a person&#x27;s income regardless of who was beneficially entitled to that income, but now tax is paid on income to which the taxpayer is beneficially entitled. Most companies were taken out of the income tax net in 1965 when corporation tax was introduced. These changes were consolidated by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970. Also the schedules under which tax is levied have changed. Schedule B was abolished in 1988, Schedule C in 1996 and Schedule E in 2003. For income tax purposes, the remaining schedules were superseded by the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, which also repealed Schedule F. For corporation tax purposes, the Schedular system was repealed and superseded by the Corporation Tax Acts of 2009 and 2010. The highest rate of income tax peaked in the Second World War at 99.25%. This was slightly reduced after the war and was around 97.5 per cent (nineteen shillings and sixpence in the pound) through the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1971, the top rate of income tax on earned income was cut to 75%. A surcharge of 15% on investment income kept the overall top rate on that income at 90%. In 1974 the top tax rate on earned income was again raised, to 83%. With the investment income surcharge this raised the overall top rate on investment income to 98%, the highest permanent rate since the war. This applied to incomes over £20,000 (equivalent to £ in terms). In 1974, around 750,000 people paid the higher (but not necessarily the top) rate of income tax.

Margaret Thatcher, who favoured indirect taxation, reduced personal income tax rates during the 1980s. In the first budget after her election victory in 1979, the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% and the basic rate from 33% to 30%. The basic rate was further cut in three subsequent budgets, to 29% in 1986 budget, 27% in 1987 and 25% in 1988. The top rate of income tax was cut to 40% in the 1988 budget. The investment income surcharge was abolished in 1985.

Subsequent governments reduced the basic rate further, to the present level of 20% in 2007. Since 1976 (when it stood at 35%), the basic rate has been reduced by 15%, but this reduction has been largely offset by increases in national insurance contributions and value added tax.

In 2010 a new top rate of 50% was introduced on income over £150,000. The then opposition Conservative party claimed that this policy caused a decrease in revenue to the Exchequer, by incentivizing tax-avoidance or emigration/offshoring. 

In the 2012 budget this rate was cut to 45% for 2013–14. The Budget Red Book showed an Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) prediction that the rate cut would be a net cost to the treasury of around 100 million per year The outturn was an £8 billion increase in the tax paid by additional rate taxpayers from £38 billion to £46 billion. Chancellor George Osborne said that the lower, more competitive tax rate had caused the increase.

The OBR has discussed the successive changes in tax take drawing attention to complications from &quot;forestalling&quot; (and &quot;unwinding&quot; of forestalling) and &quot;income-shifting&quot; (as both rate changes were pre-announced, some high earners were first able to bring forward earnings to before the rate increase came into effect, under the outgoing Labour government, and then delay them to occur after the rate decrease under the new Lib-Con Coalition Government). They also discuss systemic reasons for the tax falling in the first instance, but say &quot;It is too early to provide a meaningful reassessment of the costing of the reduction.&quot;

In September 2022 chancellor, Kwazi Kwarteng, announced that from April 2023 the top rate of tax would be 40% and the basic rate 19%, as part of what was referred to as a &quot;Growth Plan&quot;. After the collapse of the Truss government, the changes were cancelled.

HMRC has published online a comprehensive set of manuals about the UK tax system.

==Overview==
Income tax forms the single largest source of revenues collected by the government. The second largest source of government revenue is National Insurance Contributions. The third largest source of government revenues is value added tax (VAT), and the fourth-largest is corporation tax.

===Residence and domicile===

United Kingdom source income is generally subject to UK taxation whatever the citizenship and place of residence of an individual, or the place of registration of a company. This means that the UK income tax liability of an individual who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is limited to any tax deducted at source on UK income, together with tax on income from a trade or profession carried on through a permanent establishment in the UK and tax on rental income from UK real estate.

People who are both resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom are additionally liable to taxation on their worldwide income and gains. For people resident but not domiciled in the United Kingdom (&quot;non-doms&quot;), foreign income and gains have historically been taxed on the remittance basis, that is to say, only income and gains remitted to the United Kingdom are taxed. Where arrangements to be taxed in the UK rather than abroad lead to less tax the United Kingdom is a tax haven, conversely. where having income taxed abroad is beneficial. that country would be the tax haven. From 6 April 2008, a long-term non-dom (defined as resident in 7 of the previous 9 years) wishing to retain the remittance basis is required to pay an annual tax of £30,000. Since 6 April 2017, non-doms who have been resident in the UK for 15 out of the last 20 tax years lose their non-dom status and become liable for tax on worldwide income and capital gains, and their worldwide assets become subject to inheritance tax on death.

UK-domiciled people who are not resident for three consecutive tax years are not liable for UK tax on their worldwide income, and those who are not resident for five consecutive tax years are not liable for UK tax on their worldwide capital gains. Anyone physically present in the UK for 183 or more days in a tax year is classed as resident for that year.

&quot;Domicile&quot; is a term with a technical meaning. Essentially a person is domiciled in the United Kingdom if the UK is deemed to be their permanent home. A British citizen may be accepted by the tax authorities as non-domiciled in the UK, but being born in another country, or in Britain to a non-domiciled father, facilitates non-dom status.

A company is resident in the United Kingdom if it is incorporated there or if its central management and control are there (although in the former case a company could be resident in another jurisdiction in certain circumstances where a tax treaty applies).

Double taxation of income and capital gains may be avoided by an applicable double tax treaty; the United Kingdom has one of the largest networks of treaties of any country.

====Non-domiciled status ====
UK residents whose permanent home is outside the UK may be entitled to non-domiciled status. A non-domiciled UK resident earning less than £2,000 in a year outside the UK does not pay tax on this unless it is transferred to the UK. This would apply to the typical person taking up a temporary job in the UK, being paid, and paying tax on it, in the UK, with possible additional small earnings in the home country. For a person with larger foreign income the rules are rather complex, but, for example, earnings may not be taxed at all in the UK if not brought into the UK, subject to the person paying an annual charge of £30,000. Details are explained on the UK government website, and there is a simpler explanation in the context of a particular non-domiciled person on the BBC website.

The majority of people making use of the non-domiciled tax exemption are wealthy individuals with substantial income from outside of the United Kingdom. Typical non-domiciled UK residents include senior company executives, bankers, lawyers, business owners and international recording artists; see list of people with non-domiciled status in the UK.

===The tax year===
The tax year is sometimes also called the &quot;fiscal year&quot;. A company&#x27;s accounting year, which has some relevance for corporation tax purposes, can be chosen by the company and often runs from 1 April to 31 March, in line with the fiscal year.

The British personal tax year runs from 6 to 5 April in the following year.

==Personal taxes==

===Income tax===


Income tax is the single largest source of government revenue in the United Kingdom, making up about 30 per cent of the total, followed by National Insurance contributions at around 20 per cent. More than 25% of all income tax revenue is paid by the top 1% of taxpayers, i.e. taxpayers with the highest incomes, and 90% of all income tax revenue is paid by the top 50% of taxpayers with the highest incomes. The Scottish Parliament has full control over income tax rates and thresholds on all non-savings and non-dividend income liable for tax by taxpayers resident in Scotland. The Welsh Parliament also has some powers over income tax in Wales, but they have not been used.

Each person has an income tax personal allowance, and income up to this amount in each tax year is free of tax. Until the 2027/28 tax year, the tax-free allowance for individuals with income less than £100,000 is £12,570.
Any income above the personal allowance is taxed using a number of bands:

Taxpayer&#x27;s income is assessed for tax according to a prescribed order, with income from employment using up the personal allowance and being taxed first, followed by savings income (from interest or otherwise unearned) and then dividends.

Foreign income of United Kingdom residents is taxed as United Kingdom income, but to prevent double taxation the United Kingdom has agreements with many countries to allow offset against United Kingdom tax what is deemed paid abroad. These deemed amounts paid abroad are not necessarily as much as actually paid.

Rental income on a property investment business (such as a buy to let property) is taxed as other savings income, after allowing deductions including mortgage interest. The mortgage does not need to be secured against the property receiving the rent, subject to a maximum of the purchase prices of the property investment business properties (or the market value at the time they transferred into the business). Joint owners can decide how they divide income and expenses, as long as one does not make a profit and the other a loss. Losses can be brought forward to subsequent years.

==== England, Wales and Northern Ireland ====
===== Current rates =====

This table reflects the removal of the 10% starting rate from April 2008, which also saw the 22% income tax rate drop to 20%. From April 2010, the Labour government introduced a 50% income tax rate for those earning more than £150,000. Income threshold for high taxation rate on income was decreased to £32,011 in 2013. The coalition government raised this allowance in years following 2014, and the 50% tax bracket was reduced to its current 45% rate.

==== Scotland ====

Since 2017 the Scottish Parliament has had the power to set the tax band thresholds (excluding the personal allowance) as well as the rates on all non-savings and non-dividend income of Scottish taxpayers.

†Assumes individuals are in receipt of the Standard UK Personal Allowance.

††Those earning more than £100,000 will see their Personal Allowance reduced by £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000.

====Exemptions on investment====
Certain investments carry a tax favoured status, including:
; UK Government Bonds (gilts)
: While all income is taxable, gains are exempt for income tax purposes.
; National Savings and Investments
: Certain investments via the state owned National Savings scheme are not subject to tax including Index linked Certificates (up to £15,000 per issue) and Premium Bonds, a scheme that issues monthly prizes in place of interest on individual holdings up to £50,000.
; Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs)
: Interest is paid tax free, while dividends are paid along with a tax credit to the investor which can then be offset against dividend tax due. For a basic rate tax payer this means they have no tax to pay on a dividend. There is no overall limit on how much a person can have invested in ISA accounts, but additional investments are currently limited to £20,000 per person per year, either in cash funds, mutual funds (Units Trusts and OEICs), or individual self-selected shares.
; Pension funds
: These have the same tax treatment as ISAs in terms of growth. Full tax relief is also given at the individual&#x27;s marginal rate on contributions or, in the case of an employer contributions, it is treated as an expense and is not taxed on the employee as a benefit in kind. Aside from a tax free lump sum of 25% of the fund, benefits taken from pension funds are taxable.
; Venture Capital Trusts
: These are investments in smaller companies or funds of holdings in such companies over a minimum term of five years. These are not taxable and qualify for 30 per cent tax relief against an individual&#x27;s income.
; Enterprise Investment Schemes
: A non-taxable investment into smaller company shares over three years that qualifies for 30 per cent tax relief. The facility also allows an individual to defer capital gains liabilities (these gains can be stripped out in future years using the annual CGT allowance).
; Seed Enterprise Investment Schemes
: A non-taxable investment into smaller company shares over three years that qualifies for 50 per cent tax relief. The facility also allows an individual to defer capital gains liabilities (these gains can be stripped out in future years using the annual CGT allowance).
* Insurance bonds
: These include offshore and onshore investment bonds issued by insurance companies. The main difference between the two is that corporation tax paid by the onshore bond means that gains in the onshore bond are treated as if basic rate tax has been paid (this cannot be reclaimed by zero or starting rate tax payers). With both versions up to 5 per cent for each complete year of investment can be taken without an immediate tax liability (subject to a maximum total of 100 per cent of the original investment). On this basis, investors can plan an income stream while deferring any chargeable withdrawals until they are on a lower rate of tax, are no longer a United Kingdom resident, or their death.
; Offshore trusts and companies
: Trusts can be offshore if all trustees are non-resident. Such trusts can own foreign-operated companies. Corporation tax rates can be lower in some countries and where we still have double taxation treaties. However, since anti-avoidance rules have been introduced for taxation of trusts, these structures are not advantageous for someone who will remain resident.

====Exceptions====
Many holdings and income from them are exempt for &quot;historical reasons&quot;. These include:
* Special, low tax arrangements for the monarchy, such as the arrangement used by the British Royal Family to avoid inheritance tax.
* Reduced income tax for special classes of person. For instance non-doms, who are resident in the United Kingdom but not &quot;domiciled&quot;, are not subject to UK income tax on their non-UK income provided the remittance basis of taxation is claimed (or applies automatically) and the non-UK income is not remitted to the UK. After seven years of tax residence, the remittance basis can carry a substantial tax charge and UK residents will usually be deemed to be domiciled of the UK after fifteen years of residence without a gap of five years.
* An Act of Parliament to protect the Earl of Abingdon and his heirs and assignees from paying income tax on the tolls on the Swinford Toll Bridge.
* The income of charities is usually exempt from United Kingdom income tax.

===Inheritance tax===

Inheritance tax is levied on &quot;transfers of value&quot;, meaning:
# the estates of deceased persons;
# gifts made within seven years of death (known as Potentially Exempt Transfers or &quot;PETs&quot;);
# &quot;lifetime chargeable transfers&quot;, meaning transfers into certain types of trust. See Taxation of trusts (United Kingdom).
The first slice of cumulative transfers of value (known as the &quot;nil rate band&quot;) is free of tax. This threshold is currently set at £325,000 (tax year 2012/13) and has recently failed to keep up with house price inflation with the result that some 6 million households currently fall within the scope of inheritance tax. Over this threshold the rate is 40 per cent on death or 36 per cent if the estate qualifies for a reduced rate as a result of a charitable donation.

Since October 2007, married couples and registered civil partners can effectively increase the threshold on their estate when the second partner dies – to as much as £650,000 in 2012–13. Their executors or personal representatives must transfer the first spouse or civil partner&#x27;s unused Inheritance Tax threshold or &#x27;nil rate band&#x27; to the second spouse or civil partner when they die.

Transfers of value between United Kingdom-domiciled spouses are exempt from tax. Recent changes to the tax brought in by the Finance Act 2008 mean that nil-rate bands are transferable between spouses to reduce this burden – something which previously could only be done by setting up complex trusts.

Gifts made more than seven years prior to death are not taxed; if they are made between three and seven years before death a tapered inheritance tax rate applies. There are some important exceptions to this treatment: the most important is the &quot;reservation of benefit rule&quot;, which says that a gift is ineffective for inheritance tax purposes if the giver benefits from the asset in any way after the gift (for example, by gifting a house but continuing to live in it).

Inheritance Tax is not levied on the estate of persons who died &quot;on active service&quot; or from the effects of wounds sustained on such service...regardless of how long after that may be if it can be proven as the cause of death. In addition as the deceased spouse is subject to an exemption that full nil rate band is transferable to the surviving spouse&#x27;s estate on the survivor&#x27;s death.

===Council Tax===
Council tax is the system of local taxation used in England, Scotland and Wales to part fund the services provided by local government in each country. It was introduced in 1993 by the Local Government Finance Act 1992, as a successor to the unpopular Community Charge (&quot;poll tax&quot;), which had (briefly) replaced the Rates system. The basis for the tax is residential property, with discounts for single people.
As of 2008, the average annual levy on a property in England was £1,146. In 2006–2007 council tax in England amounted to £22.4 billion and an additional £10.8 billion in sales, fees and charges.. In Scotland from April 2024, all but three of the Scottish local councils introduced a 100% &quot;additional levy&quot; on second homes. Unfortunately this change was introduced very close to the beginning of the 2024-25 Council Tax year beginning, and it is unclear what procedures Councils have in place for identifying second homes. Many second home owners have been left in a state of confusion regarding how this change will be implemented upon them.

In October 2024, Local authorities in England had warned of a potential £54 billion funding shortfall due to rising costs in social care and school transport, according to a report from the County Councils Network (CCN). Over the next five years, councils faced significant financial challenges, with 83% of anticipated service cost increases attributed to adult social care, children&#x27;s services, and home-to-school transport.

==Sales taxes and duties==

===Value added tax===

The third largest source of government revenues is value added tax (VAT), charged at 20 per cent on supplies of goods and services. It is therefore a tax on consumer expenditure.

Certain goods and services are exempt from VAT, and others are subject to VAT at a lower rate of 5 per cent (the reduced rate, such as domestic gas supplies) or 0 per cent (&quot;zero-rated&quot;, such as most food and children&#x27;s clothing). Exemptions are intended to relieve the tax burden on essentials while placing the full tax on luxuries, but disputes based on fine distinctions arise, such as the &quot;Jaffa Cake Case&quot; which hinged on whether Jaffa Cakes were classed as (zero-rated) cakes—as was eventually decided—or (fully taxed) chocolate-covered biscuits. Until 2001, VAT was charged at the full rate on sanitary towels.

VAT was introduced in 1973, in consequence of Britain&#x27;s entry to the European Economic Community, at a standard rate of 10 per cent. In July 1974, the standard rate became 8 per cent and from October that year petrol was taxed at a new higher rate of 25 per cent. In the budget of April 1975 the higher rate was extended to a wide range of &quot;luxury&quot; goods. In the budget of April 1976 the 25 per cent higher rate was reduced to 12.5 per cent. On 18 June 1979, the higher rate was scrapped and VAT set at a single rate of 15 per cent. In 1991 this became 17.5 per cent, though when domestic fuel and power was added to the scheme in 1994, it was charged at a new, lower rate of 8 per cent.

In September 1997 this lower rate of 8 per cent was reduced to 5 per cent and was extended to cover various energy-saving materials (from 1 July 1998), sanitary protection (from 1 January 2001), children&#x27;s car seats (from 1 April 2001), conversion and renovation of certain residential properties (from 12 May 2001), contraceptives (from 1 July 2006) and smoking cessation products (from 1 July 2007).

On 1 December 2008, VAT was reduced to 15 per cent, as a reaction to the late-2000s recession, by Chancellor Alistair Darling.

On 1 January 2010, VAT returned to 17.5 per cent.

On 4 January 2011, VAT was raised to 20 per cent by Chancellor George Osborne, where it remains.

===Excise duties===
Excise duties are charged on, amongst other things, motor fuel, alcohol, tobacco, betting and vehicles.

===Stamp duty===
Stamp duty is charged on the transfer of shares and certain securities at a rate of 0.5 per cent. Modernised versions of stamp duty, stamp duty land tax and stamp duty reserve tax, are charged respectively on the transfer of real property and shares and securities, at rates of up to 4 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.

===Motoring taxation===

Motoring taxes include: fuel duty (which itself also attracts VAT), and Vehicle Excise Duty. Other fees and charges include the London congestion charge, various statutory fees including that for the compulsory vehicle test and that for vehicle registration, and in some areas on-street parking (as well as associated charges for violations).

==Business taxes==

===Corporate Tax===

Corporation tax is a tax levied in the United Kingdom on the profits made by companies and on the profits of permanent establishments of non-UK resident companies and associations that trade in the EU.

Corporation tax forms the fourth-largest source of government revenue (after income, NIC, and VAT). Prior to the tax&#x27;s enactment on 1 April 1965, companies and individuals paid the same income tax, with an additional profits tax levied on companies. The Finance Act 1965 replaced this structure for companies and associations with a single corporate tax, which borrowed its basic structure and rules from the income tax system. Since 1997, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Tax Law Rewrite Project has been modernising the United Kingdom&#x27;s tax legislation, starting with income tax, while the legislation imposing corporation tax has itself been amended; the rules governing income tax and corporation tax have thus diverged.

===Business rates===

Business rates is the commonly used name of non-domestic rates, a rate or tax charged to occupiers of non-domestic property. Business rates form part of the funding for local government, and are collected by them, but rather than receipts being retained directly they are pooled centrally and then redistributed. In 2005–06, £19.9 billion was collected in business rates, representing 4.35 per cent of the total United Kingdom tax income.

Business rates are a property tax, where each non-domestic property is assessed with a rateable value, expressed in pounds. The rateable value broadly represents the annual rent the property could have been let for on a particular valuation date according to a set of assumptions. The actual bill payable is then calculated using a multiplier set by central government, and applying any reliefs.

===Plastic packaging tax===
Plastic Packaging Tax was introduced on 1 April 2022.

==Business and personal taxes==
Some taxes are, depending on the circumstances, paid by both individuals and companies, and government

===National Insurance contributions===

The second largest source of government revenue is National Insurance contributions (NICs). NICs are payable by employees, employers and the self-employed and in the 2010–2011 tax year £96.5 billion was raised, 21.5 per cent of the total collected by HMRC.

Employees and employers pay contributions according to a complex classification based on employment type and income. Class 1 (employed persons) NIC is charged at several rates depending on various income thresholds and a number of other factors including age, the type of occupational pension scheme contributed to by the employee and/or employer and whether or not the employee is an ocean-going mariner. Certain married women who opted to pay reduced contributions (in return for reduced benefits) prior to 1977 retain this right for historical reasons.

Employers also pay contributions on many benefits in kind provided to employees (such as company cars) and on tax liabilities met on behalf of employees via a &quot;PAYE Settlement Agreement&quot;.

There are separate arrangements for self-employed persons, who are normally liable to Class 2 flat rate NIC and Class 4 earnings-related NIC, and for some voluntary sector workers.

===Health and social care levy===

On 7 September 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that a new tax would be introduced from April 2023 in order to fund the National Health Service backlogs arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reform of social care in England. The tax would have a similar application to NICs and will be charged to both employees and employers at a rate of 1.25% on an individual&#x27;s earnings. However, it would also be payable beyond State Pension Age, which is not the case for NICs. From April 2022 to March 2023, the 1.25% increase would temporarily apply to NICs. The aim was to give HMRC time to make the changes required in order for the levy to be introduced. The Truss ministry reversed the implementation of this tax and reverted the NICs as of 6 November 2022.

===Capital gains tax===

Capital gains are subject to tax at 10 or 20 per cent (18 or 28 for capital gains relating to residential property)(for individuals) or at the applicable marginal rate of corporation tax (for companies).

The basic principle is the same for individuals and companies - the tax applies only on the disposal of a capital asset, and the amount of the gain is calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the &quot;base cost&quot;, being the original purchase price plus allowable related expenditure. However, from 6 April 2008, the rate and reliefs applicable to the chargeable gain differ between individuals and companies. Companies apply &quot;indexation relief&quot; to the base cost, increasing it in accordance with the Retail Prices Index so that (broadly speaking) the gain is calculated on a post-inflation basis (with different rules apply for gains accrued prior to March 1982). The gain is then subject to tax at the applicable marginal rate of corporation tax.

Individuals are taxed at a flat rate of 18 per cent (or since 22 June 2010, 28 per cent for higher rate taxpayers) with no indexation relief. However, if claiming Entrepreneurs&#x27; Relief the rate remains 10 per cent. Capital losses from prior years can be brought forward.

Expenditure on a business (such as a property business) made by an individual can be claimed as an allowance against Capital Gains. Whether expenditure is claimable against income (potentially reducing income tax) or capital (potentially reducing capital gains tax) depends on whether there was improvement of the property: if there was none, it is against income; if there was some, then it is against capital.

Transfers between husband and wife or between civil partners do not crystallise a capital gain, but instead transfer the purchase price (book cost). Otherwise, transfers made as gifts are treated for CGT purposes as being made at the market value at the date of transfer.

==Tax gap==
The &#x27;tax gap&#x27; is the difference between the amount of tax that should, in theory, be collected by HMRC, against what is actually collected. The tax gap for the UK in 2013–14 was £34 billion, or 6.4 per cent of total tax liabilities. It can be broken down by tax type

<text>The Red River, long, is a major stream of north-central Tennessee and south-central Kentucky, and a major tributary of the Cumberland River.

It rises in Sumner County, Tennessee, south of Portland. Trending generally northwest, it is crossed by several roads, notably State Route 76, U.S. Route 31W, and Interstate 65. A major tributary, the South Fork, forms nearby and runs parallel and south of the main river for several miles. For almost its entire length, it drains the northern Highland Rim of Tennessee and the adjacent (and analogous) Pennyroyal Plateau of Kentucky.

The Red River crosses briefly into Simpson County, Kentucky, and then enters Logan County, Kentucky. The South Fork also crosses into Logan County, coming from Robertson County, Tennessee, and joining the Red west of Adairville. Crossing the state line into Robertson County, the Red continues to flow primarily westward but with minor meanders. Crossed by U.S. Highway 41 near Adams, Tennessee, it is joined by an important tributary, Sulphur Fork, at the historic site of Port Royal, now a designated Tennessee State Historic Area. Tobacco was at one time loaded here onto shallow-draught boats, and a covered bridge crossed here. (The original covered bridge washed away in a flood, as a rebuilt replica also did subsequently.) The Red River and Sulphur Fork both form a small portion of the Robertson County-Montgomery County line, and the confluence at Port Royal marks a major jog in this line.

Flowing toward the Montgomery County seat of Clarksville, the stream is crossed by Interstate 24. It formerly marked the boundary between Clarksville and the adjoining community of New Providence; New Providence has long been annexed into Clarksville and is now regarded as a neighborhood of Clarksville, not a separate community. About above its mouth into the Cumberland, the Red River is joined by the West Fork of the Red River, its last tributary, which drains eastern Christian County and western Todd County, Kentucky. It is crossed by U.S. Route 41 Alternate just before its confluence with the Cumberland.

The stream&#x27;s name derives from its typical water color. This is caused by a large load of clay and silt which contains iron oxides. As the area drained by the Red River becomes somewhat less agricultural and more of the remaining farmers switch to techniques involving less cultivation, it is likely that this color will continue to lessen in intensity, but certainly will not vanish.

The drainage basin around the Red River is the Red River Watershed. The entire watershed collects rain from an area large.

==Attractions==
The Red River Meeting House stands near the section of Red River that flows through Logan County. This meeting house was the site of one of the early revivals of the Second Great Awakening, a religious movement that swept over the United States near the turn of the 19th century. Red River Canoe, located in Adams, TN is known for its shallow slow moving current with canoes and kayaks to rent. A place of interest is the Bell Witch Cave, which is located on the left-hand side of the river.

<doc id="890509" wikidata="Q1437648" url="?curid=890509" title="Matins">
<text>Matins (also Mattins) is a canonical hour in Christian liturgy, originally sung during the darkness of early morning (between midnight and dawn).

The earliest use of the term was in reference to the canonical hour, also called the vigil, which was originally celebrated by monks from about two hours after midnight to, at latest, the dawn, the time for the canonical hour of lauds (a practice still followed in certain orders). It was divided into two or (on Sundays) three nocturns. Outside of monasteries, it was generally recited at other times of the day, often in conjunction with lauds.

==Liturgy==
In the Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Catholic Church, Matins is also called “the Office of Readings”, which includes several psalms, a chapter of a book of Scripture (assigned according to the liturgical seasons), and a reading from the works of patristic authors or saints.

In the Byzantine Rite, these vigils correspond to the aggregate comprising the Midnight office, orthros, and the first hour.

Lutherans preserve recognizably traditional Matins, distinct from the office of morning prayer. 

In the Anglican Daily Office, Matins, occasionally spelled Mattins, combines the hours of Matins and Lauds as established by St. Benedict in Roman Catholicism and observed in England until the Reformation, most grandly in the Sarum Rite. It is one of the two daily times for prayer, the other being Evensong, which combines St. Benedict&#x27;s Vespers and Compline. 

In Oriental Orthodox Christianity and Oriental Protestant Christianity, the office is prayed at 6 am, being known as Sapro in the Syriac and Indian traditions; it is prayed facing the eastward direction of prayer by all members in these denominations, both clergy and laity, being one of the seven fixed prayer times.

&quot;Matins&quot; is sometimes used in other Protestant denominations to describe any morning service.

==History==
From the time of the early Church, the practice of seven fixed prayer times has been taught; in &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot;, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray seven times a day &quot;on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight&quot; and &quot;the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ&#x27;s Passion.&quot; With respect to praying in the early morning, Hippolytus wrote: &quot;Likewise, at the hour of the cock-crow, rise and pray. Because at this hour, with the cock-crow, the children of Israel refused Christ, who we know through faith, hoping daily in the hope of eternal light in the resurrection of the dead.&quot;

===Roman Rite===
====Vigil====
The every-night monastic canonical hour that later became known as matins was at first called a vigil, from Latin &quot;vigilia&quot;. For soldiers, this word meant a three-hour period of being on the watch during the night. Even for civilians, night was commonly spoken of as divided into four such watches: the Gospels use the term when recounting how, at about &quot;the fourth watch of the night&quot;, Jesus came to his disciples who in their boat were struggling to make headway against the wind, and one of the Psalms says to the Lord: &quot;A thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.&quot;

The sixth-century &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; uses the term &quot;vigiliae&quot; (&quot;vigils&quot;) fifteen times to speak of these celebrations, accompanying it four times with the adjective &quot;nocturnae&quot; (&quot;nocturnal&quot;) and once with the words &quot;septem noctium&quot; (&quot;of the seven nights&quot;, i.e., the nights of the week).

English versions of this document often obscure its use of the term vigil, translating it as &quot;Night Hour&quot; or &quot;Night Office&quot;. Thus Leonard J. Doyle&#x27;s English version uses &quot;Night Office&quot; to represent indifferently the unaccompanied noun &quot;vigilia&quot; (&quot;vigil&quot;), the phrase &quot;nocturna vigilia&quot; (&quot;nightly vigil&quot;), and the phrases &quot;nocturna hora&quot; (&quot;night hour) and &quot;nocturna laus&quot; (&quot;nocturnal praise&quot;).

The practice of rising for prayer in the middle of the night is as old as the Church. Tertullian () speaks of the &quot;nocturnal convocations&quot; (&quot;nocturnae convocationes&quot;) of Christians and their &quot;absence all the night long at the paschal solemnities&quot; (&quot;sollemnibus Paschae abnoctantes&quot;) Cyprian ( – 258) also speaks of praying at night, but not of doing so as a group: &quot;Let there be no failure of prayers in the hours of night — no idle and reckless waste of the occasions of prayer&quot; (&quot;nulla sint horis nocturnis precum damna, nulla orationum pigra et ignava dispendia&quot;). The &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot; speaks of prayer at midnight and again at cockcrow, but seemingly as private, not communal, prayer. At an earlier date, Pliny the Younger reported in about 112 that Christians gathered on a certain day before light, sang hymns to Christ as to a god and shared a meal. The solemn celebration of vigils in the churches of Jerusalem in the early 380s is described in the &quot;Peregrinatio Aetheriae&quot;.

Prayer at midnight and at cockcrow was associated with passages in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark. On the basis of the Gospel of Luke, too, prayer at any time of the night was seen as having eschatological significance.

The quotation from Tertullian above refers to the all-night vigil liturgy held at Easter. A similar liturgy came to be held in the night that led to any Sunday. By the fourth century this Sunday vigil had become a daily observance, but no longer lasted throughout the night. What had been an all-night vigil became a liturgy only from cockcrow to before dawn. Saint Benedict wrote about it as beginning at about 2 in the morning (&quot;the eighth hour of the night&quot;) and ending in winter well before dawn (leaving an interval in which the monks were to devote themselves to study or meditation), but having to be curtailed in summer in order to celebrate lauds at daybreak.

====&quot;Matins&quot;====
The word &quot;matins&quot; is derived from the Latin adjective , meaning &#x27;of or belonging to the morning&#x27;. It was at first applied to the psalms recited at dawn, but later became attached to the prayer originally offered, according to the fourth-century &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot;, at cockcrow and, according to the sixth-century &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;, at could be calculated to be the eighth hour of the night (the hour that began at about 2 a.m.).

Between the vigil office and the dawn office in the long winter nights there was an interval, which &quot;should be spent in study by those [monks] who need a better knowledge of the Psalter or the lessons&quot;; in the summer nights the interval was short, only enough for the monks to &quot;go out for the necessities of nature&quot;. The vigil office was also shortened in the summer months by replacing readings with a passage of scripture recited by heart, but keeping the same number of psalms. Both in summer and in winter the vigil office was longer than on other days, with more reading and the recitation of canticles in addition to the psalms.

Outside monasteries few rose at night to pray. The canonical hour of the vigil was said in the morning, followed immediately by lauds, and the name of &quot;matins&quot; became attached to the lengthier part of what was recited at that time of the day, while the name of &quot;lauds&quot;, a name originally describing only the three Psalms 148−150 recited every day at the end of the dawn office (until excised in the 1911 reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X; see Lauds), was applied to the whole of that office, substituting for the lost name of &quot;matins&quot; or variants such as &quot;laudes matutinae&quot; (morning praises) and &quot;matutini hymni&quot; (morning hymns). An early instance of the application of the named &quot;matins&quot; to the vigil office is that of the Council of Tours in 567, which spoke of &quot;ad matutinum sex antiphonae&quot;.

The &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; clearly distinguished matins as the nighttime hour, to which he applied Psalm 118/119:62, &quot;At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules&quot;.

The word &quot;vigil&quot; also took on a different meaning: not only a prayerful night watch before a religious feast, but the day before a feast.

====Monastic matins====
The canonical hour began with the versicle &quot;Lord, open our lips: And we shall praise your name&quot; (the latter said three times) followed by Psalm 3 and Psalm 94/95 (the invitatory). The invitatory was to be recited slowly out of consideration for any late-arriving monk, since anyone appearing after its conclusion was punished by having to stand in a place apart. After this a hymn was sung.

Next came two sets of six psalms followed by readings. (Such sets would later be called nocturns.) The first set was of six psalms followed by three readings from the Old or New Testaments or from Church Fathers. Each reading was followed by a responsory. The second set of six psalms was followed by a passage from the Apostle Paul recited by heart and by some prayers. The Night Office then concluded with a versicle and a litany that began with Kyrie eleison.

Since summer nights are shorter, from Easter to October a single passage from the Old Testament, recited by heart, took the place of the three readings used during the rest of the year.

On Sundays, the office was longer, and therefore began a little earlier. Each set of six psalms was followed by four readings instead of three after the first set and a single recitation by heart after the second set. Then three canticles taken from Old Testament books other than the Psalms were recited, followed by four readings from the New Testament, the singing of the Te Deum, and a reading by the abbot from the Gospels, after which another hymn was sung.

====&quot;Roman Breviary&quot; matins====
In the &quot;Roman Breviary&quot;, use of which was made obligatory throughout the Latin Church (with exceptions for forms of the Liturgy of the Hours that could show they had been in continuous use for at least two hundred years) by Pope Pius V in 1568, matins and lauds were seen as a single canonical hour, with lauds as an appendage to matins.

Its matins began, as in the monastic matins, with versicles and the invitatory Psalm 94 (Psalm 95 in the Masoretic text) chanted or recited in the responsorial form, that is to say, by one or more cantors singing one verse, which the choir repeated as a response to the successive verses sung by the cantors. A hymn was then sung.

After that introduction, Sunday matins had three sections (&quot;nocturns&quot;), the first with 12 psalms and 3 very short scriptural readings; the second with 3 psalms and 3 equally short patristic readings; and the third with 3 psalms and 3 short extracts from a homily. Matins of feasts of double or semidouble rank had 3 nocturns, each with 3 psalms and 3 readings. On a feast of simple rank, a &quot;feria&quot; or a vigil day, matins had 12 psalms and 3 readings with no division into nocturns.

The psalms used at matins in the Roman Breviary from Sunday to Saturday were Psalms 1−108/109 in consecutive order, omitting a few that were reserved for other canonical hours: Psalms 4, 5, 21/22−25/26, 41/42, 50/51, 53/54, 62/63, 66/67, 89/90−92/93. The consecutive order was not observed for the invitatory psalms, recited every day, and in the matins of feasts.

Each reading was followed by a responsory, except the last one, when this was followed by the &quot;Te Deum&quot;.

====20th-century changes====
Matins underwent profound changes in the 20th century. The first of these changes was the reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X in 1911, resulting in what Pope Paul VI called &quot;a new Breviary&quot;. The reservation of Psalms 1-108/109 to matins and the consecutive order within that group were abandoned, and, apart from the invitatory psalm, which continued in its place at matins every day, no psalm was ordinarily repeated within the same week. To facilitate an even distribution among the days of the week, the longer psalms were divided into shorter portions, as only the very long Psalm 118/119 had been previously. Matins no longer had 18 psalms on Sundays, 12 on ordinary days and 9 on the more important feasts: on every day it had 9 psalms, either distributed among three nocturns or recited all together, maintaining the distinction between celebrations as three nocturns with nine readings (including Sundays) and those arranged as a single nocturn with only three readings.

In 1947, Pope Pius XII entrusted examination of the whole question of the Breviary to a commission which conducted a worldwide consultation of the Catholic bishops. He authorized recitation of the psalms in a new Latin translation and in 1955 ordered a simplification of the rubrics.

In 1960, Pope John XXIII issued his &quot;Code of Rubrics&quot;, which assigned nine-readings matins only to first-class and second-class feasts and therefore reduced the readings of Sunday matins to three.

In 1970, Pope Paul VI published a revised form of the Liturgy of the Hours, in which the psalms were arranged in a four-week instead of a one-week cycle, but the variety of other texts was greatly increased, in particular the scriptural and patristic readings, while the hagiographical readings were purged of non-historical legendary content.

What had previously been called matins was given the name of &quot;Office of Readings&quot; &quot;(Officium lectionis&quot; and was declared appropriate for celebrating at any hour, while preserving its nocturnal character for those who wished to celebrate a vigil. For that purpose alternative hymns are provided and an appendix contains material, in particular canticles and readings from the Gospels, to facilitate celebration of a vigil. The Catholic Church has thus restored to the word vigil the meaning it had in early Christianity. Pope John XIII&#x27;s &quot;Code of Rubrics&quot; still used the word vigil to mean the day before a feast, but recognized the quite different character of the Easter Vigil, which, &quot;since it is not a liturgical day, is celebrated in its own way, as a night watch&quot;. The Roman liturgy now uses the term vigil either in this sense of &quot;a night watch&quot; or with regard to a Mass celebrated in the evening before a feast, not before the hour of First Vespers.

The psalmody of the Office of Readings consists of three psalms or portions of psalms, each with its own antiphon. These are followed by two extended readings with their responsories, the first from the Bible (but not from the Gospels), and the second being patristic, hagiographical, or magisterial. As already mentioned, a Gospel reading may optionally be added, preceded by vigil canticles, in order to celebrate a vigil. These are given in an appendix of the book of the Liturgy of the Hours.

To those who find it seriously difficult, because of their advanced age or for reasons peculiar to them, to observe the revised Liturgy of the Hours Pope Paul VI gave permission to keep using the previous Roman Breviary either in whole or in part. In 2007 Pope Benedict XVI allowed all clergy of the Latin Church to fulfil their canonical obligations by using the 1961 &quot;Roman Breviary&quot; issued under Pope John XXIII (but not earlier editions such as that of Pius X or Pius V). This is done by traditionalist Catholic communities, such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter and the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest.

===Non-Roman Western Rites===
In the office of the Church of Jerusalem, of which the pilgrim Ætheria gives us a description, the vigils on Sundays terminated with the solemn reading of the Gospel, in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This practice of reading the Gospel has been preserved in the Benedictine liturgy. In the Tridentine Roman Liturgy this custom, so ancient and so solemn, was no longer represented but by the Homily; but after the Second Vatican Council it has been restored for the celebration of vigils.

The Ambrosian Liturgy, better perhaps than any other, preserved traces of the great vigils or &quot;pannychides&quot;, with their complex and varied display of processions, psalmodies, etc. The same liturgy also preserved vigils of long psalmody. This nocturnal office adapted itself at a later period to a more modern form, approaching more and more closely to the Roman liturgy. Here too were found the three nocturns, with Antiphon, psalms, lessons, and responses, the ordinary elements of the Roman matins, and with a few special features quite Ambrosian.

As revised after the Second Vatican Council, the Ambrosian liturgy of the hours uses for what once called matins either the designation &quot;the part of matins that precedes lLauds in the strict sense&quot; or simply Office of Readings. Its structure is similar to that of the Roman Liturgy of the Hours, with variations such as having on Sundays three canticles, on Saturdays a canticle and two psalms, in place of the three psalms of the other days in the Ambrosian Rite and of every day in the Roman Rite.

In the Mozarabic liturgy, on the contrary, Matins is a system of antiphons, collects, and versicles which make them quite a departure from the Roman system.

==Lutheran Churches==
==Anglican Communion==
==Eastern Christianity==
===Byzantine Rite===
In the Eastern Churches, matins is called &quot;orthros&quot; in Greek (, meaning &quot;early dawn&quot; or &quot;daybreak&quot;) and &quot;Oútrenya&quot; in Slavonic (Оўтреня). It is the last of the four night offices, which also include vespers, compline, and midnight office. In traditional monasteries it is celebrated daily so as to end at sunrise. In parishes it is normally served only on Sundays and feast days.

Matins is the longest and most complex of the daily cycle of liturgies. The &quot;akolouth&quot; (fixed portion of the liturgy) is composed primarily of psalms and litanies. The sequences (variable parts) of matins are composed primarily of hymns and canons from the Octoechos (an eight-tone cycle of hymns for each day of the week, covering eight weeks), and from the Menaion (hymns for each calendar day of the year).

Matins opens with what is called the &quot;Royal Beginning&quot;, so called because the psalms (19 and 20) are attributed to King David and speak of the Messiah, the &quot;king of kings&quot;; in former times, the ektenia (litany) also mentioned the emperor by name. The Sunday orthros is the longest of the regular orthros liturgies. If celebrated in its entirety it can last up to three hours.

==Oriental Christianity==
===Syriac Orthodox Church, Indian Orthodox Church and Mar Thoma Syrian Church===
In the Syriac Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church (both of which are Oriental Orthodox Churches), as well as the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (an Oriental Protestant denomination), the Midnight Office is known as Sapro and is prayed at 6 am using the Shehimo breviary.

===Armenian Rite===
In the Armenian liturgy of the hours, Matins is known as the Midnight Office (Armenian: ի մեջ գիշերի &quot;i mej gisheri&quot;). The Armenian Book of Hours, or Zhamagirk` (Armenian: Ժամագիրք) states that the Midnight Office is celebrated in commemoration of God the Father.

Much of the liturgy consists of the kanon (Armenian: Կանոնագլուխ &quot;kanonagloukh&quot;), consisting of a sequence of psalms, hymns, prayers, and in some instances readings from the Gospels, varying according to tone of the day, feast, or liturgical season. The Armenian kanon is quite different in form from the canon of the Byzantine matins liturgy, though both likely share a common ancestor in the pre-dawn worship of the Jerusalem liturgy.

====Basic outline of Matins in the Armenian Church====
Introduction (common to all liturgical hours): &quot;Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father...Amen.&quot;

Fixed Preface

“Lord, if you open my lips, my mouth shall declare your praise.” (twice)

Acclamation: “Blessed is the consubstantial, unitary, and undivided Holy Trinity...Amen.

Psalms, Hebrew numbering in parentheses: 3, 88 (87), 103 (102), 143 (142) 

“Glory to the Father...now and always...Amen”

Hymn of the Night Liturgy by Nerses Shnorhali: “Let us remember your name in the night, Lord...”

Proclamation by John Mandakuni “Having all been awakened in the night from the repose of sleep...”

“Lord, have mercy” (variable number of times: thrice for Sundays and feasts of Christ, 50 times for the feasts of saints, 100 times on days of fasting)

Hymn of Nerses Shnorhali: “All the world... (Ashkharh amenayn)”

“Lord, have mercy” (thrice). “Through the intercession of the Birthgiver of God: Remember, Lord, and have mercy.”

Hymn of Nerses Shnorhali: “The rising of the sun... (Aṛawowt lowsoy)”

Prayer: “We thank you...”

Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Alleluia, alleluia.

At this point a section of the Psalter is read, followed by a canticle from the Old or New Testament. See Armenian Liturgy.
Following the Psalms and the Canticle is the Canon, a complex sequence of psalms, hymns, and prayers which varies in part according to the liturgical calendar.

Conclusion: &quot;Our father...Amen.&quot;

The Armenian Matins or Midnight Office bears some resemblance with the Midnight office of the Byzantine Rite, such as the recitation of a movable set of hymns depending on the feast. However, the Armenian Midnight Office is generally more elaborate than the Byzantine Midnight Office, in that the Armenian counterpart includes readings from the Gospel, as well as cycles of psalms and prayers reflecting the liturgical season or feast. Other material in the Byzantine office of Matins which has a counterpart in the Armenian daily office, such as the recitation of large sections of the Psalter and the recitation of biblical canticles, occurs in the Armenian liturgy at the Sunrise Hour which follows Matins, corresponding to Lauds.

<text>John Caspar Wild (or J.C. Wild) (1804 – August 12, 1846) was a Swiss-American painter and lithographer. He created early city views and landscapes of Philadelphia, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Davenport, Iowa. 

Wild specialized in hand-colored lithographs. These views, particularly the &quot;Valley of the Mississippi Illustrated&quot;, were some of the first depictions of the American West.

==Early life==
Wild was born in Richterswil in the Canton of Zürich in Switzerland. 

==Career==
He moved to Paris, France. In 1832, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He later moved to St. Louis, Missouri. In summer 1844, he moved a final time, to Davenport, Iowa, a small town in the upper Mississippi River Valley. 

Wild fell gravely ill with tuberculosis in the summer of 1846, and he was taken in by Davenport millinery businessman George L. Webb. On his deathbed, Wild reflected upon his childhood and said that he yearned to die in homeland in Switzerland, but it was a wish that was to not be fulfilled. Wild died on August 12, 1846. Wild was laid to rest nearly on the banks of the river, which he had painted for years. Wild&#x27;s grave site was unmarked for decades.

<text>Samuel Freeman Miller (April 5, 1816 – October 13, 1890) was an American lawyer and physician who served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1862 until his death in 1890 and who authored landmark opinions in &quot;United States v. Kagama&quot; and &quot;The Slaughterhouse Cases&quot;. 

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Born in Richmond, Kentucky, Miller was the son of yeoman farmer Frederick Miller and his wife Patsy. He earned a medical degree in 1838 from Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. While practicing medicine for a decade in Barbourville, Kentucky, he taught himself the law and was admitted to the bar in 1847. Favoring the abolition of slavery, which was prevalent in Kentucky, he supported the Whigs in Kentucky.

==Career==
In 1850, Miller moved to Keokuk, Iowa, which was a state more amenable to his views on slavery, and he immediately freed his few slaves who had come with his family from Kentucky. Active in Iowa politics, he supported Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 election. Lincoln nominated Miller to the Supreme Court on July 16, 1862. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate that same day, and was sworn into office on July 21.

His opinions strongly favored Lincoln&#x27;s positions, and he upheld his wartime suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and trials by military commission. After the war, his narrow reading of the Fourteenth Amendment—he wrote the opinion in the 1873 &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot;—limited the effectiveness of the amendment. Miller wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Bradwell v. Illinois&quot;, which held that the right to practice law was not constitutionally protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
He later joined the majority opinions in &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot; and the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, holding that the amendment did not give the U.S. government the power to stop private—as opposed to state-sponsored—discrimination against blacks. In &quot;Ex parte Yarbrough&quot;, 110 U.S. 651 (1884), however, Miller held that the federal government had broad authority to act to protect black voters from violence by the Ku Klux Klan and other private groups. Miller also supported the use of broad federal power under the Commerce Clause to override state regulations, as in &quot;Wabash v. Illinois&quot;.

Justice Miller wrote 616 opinions in his 28 years on the Court; Justice Field (whose 34 year SCOTUS tenure mostly overlapped Miller&#x27;s) wrote 544 opinions; Chief Justice Marshall wrote 508 opinions in his 33 years on the Court, leading future Chief Justice William Rehnquist to describe him as &quot;very likely the dominant figure&quot; on the Court in his time. When Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died in 1873, attorneys and law journals across the country lobbied for Miller to be appointed to succeed him, but President Ulysses Grant was determined to appoint an outsider; he ultimately chose Morrison Waite. In his tribute to Miller delivered in Portland, Oregon, on October 16, 1890, George Henry Williams stated his support of Miller in detailing his interactions with President Ulysses S. Grant about Chase&#x27;s replacement.

After the 1876 presidential election between Rutherford Hayes and Samuel Tilden, Miller served on the electoral commission that awarded the disputed electoral votes to the Republican Hayes. In the 1880s, his name was floated as a Republican candidate for president.

In the winter of 1889 and spring of 1890, Justice Miller delivered a series of ten lectures on constitutional law at the National University School of Law in Washington, D.C. They were published posthumously, along with two earlier lectures delivered in 1887.

==Personal life==

Miller, a religious liberal, belonged to the Unitarian Church and served as President of the Unitarians&#x27; National Conference. He died in Washington, D.C., while still a member of the Court. Following his death in 1890, his funeral was held at Keokuk&#x27;s First Unitarian Church; Miller had been one of the congregation&#x27;s founders. He is buried at Oakland Cemetery in Keokuk, Iowa.

Miller&#x27;s first wife was Lucy Love Ballinger Miller (1827 – 1854) whom he married in 1842, and with whom he had three daughters. In 1856, he married Eliza Winter Reeves (1827 – 1900), with whom he had a son and daughter.

<doc id="890518" wikidata="Q976408" url="?curid=890518" title="Scotiabank Centre">
<text>Scotiabank Centre (formerly known as Halifax Metro Centre) is the largest multi-purpose facility in Atlantic Canada, located in downtown Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The main entrances to the building are located on Brunswick Street, at the corner of Duke Street and Carmichael Street, at the foot of Citadel Hill. The building&#x27;s box office entrance is located on Carmichael Street.

==History==

The arena was opened on February 17, 1978, as the Halifax Metro Centre, and was built into the ground to compensate for the steep elevation of the land it occupies. Spectators can see cars at street level, outside, while watching an event.

In December 2007, an Ozzy Osbourne concert sold out in nine minutes, setting a box office ticket record for the Halifax Metro Centre. In July 2008, the Halifax Metro Centre also set a record sell-out (25,000 tickets sold in 40 minutes), for two back-to-back Elton John concerts held in late September 2008. In April 2012, the Halifax Mooseheads sold-out game 6 of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League semifinals in 20 minutes. On May 9, 2013, QMJHL Presidents Cup final Game 5 sold-out in record time 11 minutes, setting another attendance mark for the Scotiabank Centre.

The facility is owned by the municipality but operated by Events East.

On June 25, 2014, it was announced that Scotiabank had won the naming rights to the facility and that the Metro Centre would be renamed the Scotiabank Centre. The facility officially opened its doors as the rebranded Scotiabank Centre on September 19, 2014.

==Arena information==

The Scotiabank Centre originally featured a full ring of bright orange seats around the playing surface, which is known as the &quot;lower bowl&quot;. It also has an incomplete &quot;upper bowl&quot; on each side of the arena facing rink-side (court-side) with seats of the same colour. In the mid to late 1990s, there were numerous renovations to the arena, including the addition of 43 SkyBoxes and 11 &quot;Executive Suites&quot;. The addition of the SkyBoxes has since partially obscured views for people sitting high up in the upper bowl. Views of some or all of the ice surface from the uppermost rows of seating is either partially or fully blocked by the boxes. To help mitigate this issue, video projection equipment was installed that projects onto the exterior rear walls of the boxes: If a video recording is being produced for an event, then a live feed of the video may be projected for the benefit of people in the obstructed parts of the upper bowl. Before the 2002–03 ice hockey season, in preparation for the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship, a new scoreboard and &quot;SilverVision&quot; LED screens were added. The arena concourses feature photographs of the various events that have taken place at the Scotiabank Centre, with one side featuring entertainment events and the other featuring sporting events. It currently has a seating capacity of 10,595 for ice hockey. The building is connected to the Downtown Halifax Link system.

When the rebranded Scotiabank Centre was unveiled in September 2014, plans to use funding received from the naming rights partnership for capital reinvestment in the facility were also announced. Started from January 2015 to September 2015 the Scotiabank Centre renovated the concessions adding Taste 902, Asian, Links, Donairs, etc. The bathrooms were also renovated, and the original orange seats were replaced with new navy blue ones. The original roof was replaced with a thermoplastic membrane through 2016 to 2017. In the summer of 2018, the original ice-level concrete floor and cooling system was replaced.

<text>Petrolia is a town in southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is part of Lambton County and is surrounded by Enniskillen Township. It is billed as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Victorian Oil Town&quot; and is often credited with starting the oil industry in North America, a claim shared with the nearby town of Oil Springs.

Lambton Central Collegiate &amp; Vocational Institute (LCCVI) is located in Petrolia.

==History==

In 1857, James Miller Williams of Hamilton began distilling some of the &quot;tar&quot; lying around Oil Springs (located a few kilometers south from Petrolia), after buying the property rights from Charles Nelson Tripp. In July or August 1858, he struck an oil deposit in Oil Springs while digging a shallow well, sparking the oil drilling industry. In 2008, the 150th anniversary of the discovery, Canada Post issued a stamp commemorating this first commercial oil well, featuring portraits of Charles Tripp and Williams. However, these early wells resulted in a large amount of wastage from gushers, estimated at of oil in 1862 alone.

Petrolia got its start in 1866 when a major gas well was found, resulting in an oil boom that caused many to abandon Oil Springs in favour of this new settlement. The place separated from Enniskillen Township and was incorporated as a town on 25 December of that same year.

Oil production went through several boom periods in Petrolia; one was in 1898 and another in 1938. Some wells sunk in 1938 were initially producing at a price of $2 per barrel. This output, however, often lasted only a few weeks, falling to less than a barrel a day.

Oil men from Petrolia travelled to the far reaches of the world (Gobi Desert, Arctic, Iran, Indonesia, United States, Australia, Russia, and over 80 other countries) teaching others how to find and extract crude oil. Those born and raised in Petrolia are referred to as &quot;Hard Oilers&quot;, paying tribute to the toughness of their ancestors. Petrolia is also home to the Petrolia Discovery museum. Some oil fields in the area are still operational.

==Media and entertainment==
Petrolia is home to Victoria Hall, a National Historic Site of Canada. Originally a fire hall, municipal office, police hall, jail and opera house, it was completed in 1889 for a total cost of $35,000. In January 1989, a fire caused extensive damage. It was subsequently restored, and re-opened in 1992. Currently it houses the town hall and Victoria Playhouse.

Directly adjacent to Victoria Hall is Petrolia&#x27;s Victoria Park, which hosts the annual &#x27;PizzaFest&#x27; food festival as a collaboration between the town and their five local pizza restaurants.

Until September 2013, The Petrolia Topic was the sole newspaper in the town of Petrolia. It is owned by Osprey Media. In September 2013, The Independent of Petrolia &amp; Central Lambton began publication.

The Oil Heritage District Community Centre was opened in Petrolia in 2006. It serves rural and town residents in central Lambton County.

<text>A proportion is a mathematical statement expressing equality of two ratios.

formula_1

a and d are called &quot;extremes&quot;, b and c are called &quot;means&quot;.

Proportion can be written as formula_2, where ratios are expressed as fractions.

Such a proportion is known as geometrical proportion, not to be confused with arithmetical proportion and harmonic proportion.

==Properties of proportions==
* Fundamental rule of proportion. This rule is sometimes called &quot;Means‐Extremes Property&quot;. If the ratios are expressed as fractions, then the same rule can be phrased in terms of the equality of &quot;cross-products&quot; and is called &quot;Cross‐Products Property&quot;.

== History ==
A Greek mathematician Eudoxus provided a definition for the meaning of the equality between two ratios. This definition of proportion forms the subject of Euclid&#x27;s Book V, where we can read:

Later, the realization that ratios are numbers allowed to switch from solving proportions to equations, and from transformation of proportions to algebraic transformations.

==Related concepts==
=== Arithmetic proportion ===

An equation of the form formula_16 is called arithmetic proportion or difference proportion.

=== Harmonic proportion ===

If the means of the geometric proportion are equal, and the rightmost extreme is equal to the difference between the leftmost extreme and a mean, then such a proportion is called harmonic: formula_17. In this case the ratio formula_18 is called &quot;golden ratio&quot;.

<doc id="890525" wikidata="Q2668618" url="?curid=890525" title="Clonmany">
<text>Clonmany () is a village and civil parish in north-west Inishowen, in County Donegal, Ireland. The Urris valley to the west of Clonmany village was the last outpost of the Irish language in Inishowen. In the 19th century, the area was an important location for poitín distillation. Outside the village, there are a number of notable townlands, including Kinnea (Rockstown), Crossconnell, Dunaff, and Leenan.

==Name==

The name of the town in Irish - &quot;Cluain Maine&quot; has been translated as both &quot;The Meadow of St Maine&quot; and &quot;The Meadow of the Monks&quot;, with the former being the more widely recognized translation. The village is known locally as &quot;The Cross&quot;, as the village was initially built around a crossroads.

==History==
The parish was home to a monastery that was founded by St Columba. It was closely associated with the Morrison family, who provided the role of erenagh. The monastery possessed the &quot;Míosach&quot;, an 11th-century copper and silver shrine, now located in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.

The village claims to be the youngest in Inishowen. The 18th-century travel writer - Richard Pococke - did not mention the village when he toured the area in 1752. The village is mentioned in &quot;Topographia Hibernica&quot;, published in 1795. It did not feature in the census of 1841 or 1851. In the 1861 census, 112 inhabitants are recorded as living in Clonmany in 21 houses. A further 3 houses are recorded as uninhabited.

===Poitin Republic of Urris===
In the early 19th century, Urris - a valley three miles west of Clonmany - became a centre of the illegal poitín distillation industry. The Urris Hills were an ideal place for poitín-making. The area was surrounded by mountains and only accessible through Mamore Gap and Crossconnell. Notwithstanding its remote location, Derry was about 16 miles away, providing a major market for the trade. To protect their lucrative business, the locals barricaded the road at Crossconnell to keep out revenue police, thus creating the &quot;Poitin Republic of Urris&quot;. This period of relative independence lasted three years. But in 1815, the authorities re-established control of the Urris Hills and brought this short period of self-rule to an end.

===1840 earthquake===
In 1840, the village experienced an earthquake, a comparatively rare event in Ireland. The shock was also felt in the nearby town of Carndonagh. The Belfast News Letter from Tuesday, 28 January 1840 reported that &quot;In some places those who had retired to rest felt themselves shaken in their beds, and others were thrown from their chairs, and greatly alarmed.&quot;

===The &quot;Waterloo Priest&quot; ===
Fr. William O&#x27;Donnell, also known as the &quot;Waterloo Priest&quot;, was a prominent figure in the Parish of Clonmany from 1829 to 1853. Born in Cockhill, Buncrana in 1779, he initially declined the opportunity to become a priest after graduating from Maynooth College. Instead, he joined the army and fought in the Peninsular war, participating in the battles of Vitoria, Roncesvalles, Pyrenees, and ultimately at the Battle of Waterloo.

In 1819, Fr. O&#x27;Donnell was ordained and began serving as parish priest in Lower Fahan and Desertegney. He later moved to Clonmany in 1829, where he remained until his death in 1856. During his time in Clonmany, Fr. O&#x27;Donnell became deeply devoted to the people of the parish and worked tirelessly to improve their lives. He established five National schools in the Parish and was a strong advocate for the rights of local people.

In 1838, during the latter years of the tithe war, Fr. O&#x27;Donnell was jailed for non-payment of tithes to the Church of Ireland. He was imprisoned in Lifford Prison and became a national focal point in the campaign against the tithe system. Fr. O&#x27;Donnell continued his efforts to aid the people of Clonmany during the devastating Great Famine of 1845–1849. He set up a Relief Committee for Clonmany in 1846 to provide assistance to those suffering from starvation. Fr. O&#x27;Donnell died on 10 February 1856, in his residence in Clonmany at the age of 77.

===Great Famine ===
Clonmany and its surrounding areas were severely impacted by the devastating potato blight, which led to the Irish Famine and caused significant loss of life among the rural population. As early as December 1845, signs of the impending disaster became apparent as the potato crop in Clonmany began to fail. The Church of Ireland Rector of Clonmany, Reverend George H. Young, reported to the Banner of Ulster newspaper that approximately half of the harvested potatoes were diseased, and an estimated three-fourths of the crop had already been lost. The situation was dire, and the availability of seed for the next season was uncertain.

In response to the crisis, local clergy members from both the Roman Catholic and Protestant communities made commendable efforts to raise funds and provide relief. By January 1847, a local relief committee was actively collecting funds to provide emergency food supplies. However, the scale of the crop failure and the outbreak of diseases like dysentery overwhelmed their endeavours.

The committee reached out to local landlords, appealing for financial assistance and forgiveness of rent arrears for struggling tenants. The response from landlords varied, with some demonstrating willingness to help, while others were not as supportive. Financial contributions came from Michael Loughrey, a local landlord associated with Binion Hall. Conversely, John Harvey and Mrs. Merrick expressed their refusal to support the relief efforts until outstanding rent arrears and other expenses were settled. The correspondence between the committee and the local landlords was subsequently published in the Derry Journal. During this period, the Derry Sentinel reported that Clonmany was witnessing a death rate of five to six individuals per day.

=== Trawbreaga Bay Fishing Disaster ===
On 23 April 1847, a fishing boat originating from the Isle of Doagh, located just outside Clonmany, embarked on a routine fishing trip with a crew of eight individuals. While navigating Trawbreaga Bay, the boat was unexpectedly overturned by a sudden swell, despite the seemingly calm weather conditions. Seven members of the crew perished as a result. The victims were identified as Donald Doherty, the boat&#x27;s owner and a father of six; Patrick Doherty, who left behind a wife and three children; James MacLoughlin, survived by his wife and four children; Patrick (Roe) Doherty, a husband and father of one; William (Noher) Doherty, an unmarried young man; Hugh M&#x27;Cool, and John McLoughlin. William Doherty, the eighth person on board, managed to swim ashore and survive.

=== Land Wars in the 19th Century ===
In the 19th century, the rural areas around Clonmany saw conflicts about land ownership and tenant rights. A movement known as the Ribbon men gained popularity in the 1830s as they protested against landlords and their agents. In February 1832, a crowd of up to three thousand local tenants launched an attack on the properties of two prominent landlords, Michael Doherty of Glen House and Neal Loughrey of Binnion. The protesters demanded reduced rents and the elimination of tithe payments to the Church of Ireland. Unrest continued in mid-1833 when a local man named O&#x27;Donnell had his house destroyed by rioters due to his occupation of an evicted tenant&#x27;s property. Additionally, rioters targeted the forge of the local blacksmith, a man called Conaghan, for providing services to the tithe agent. Properties belonging to individuals employed by landlords were also vandalized by the rioters.

In February 1834, a detachment of the 1st Royals Regiment from the Londonderry Garrison was stationed in the village to provide support to the civil authorities. However, further unrest erupted in April 1834, leading to property destruction by large rioting crowds.

Violence resurfaced in June 1838 when a group of local people attacked the residence of an absentee landlord, Mrs. Merrick, who was visiting the area to inspect her properties. In September 1838, the home of Mrs. Merrick&#x27;s bailiff, Hugh Bradley, was assaulted. Bradley was severely beaten, and his house was ransacked by armed men. Mrs. Merrick later offered a reward of £100 for any information regarding the attacks on Bradley. The Times of London described the situation as “..security there is none for either life or property in the unhappy district of Clonmany”.

On the evening of 3 November 1841, the Binion estate belonging to Michael Loughrey suffered an attack. Eight stores of oats and several haystacks were simultaneously set on fire.

In 1852, local tenants targeted Charles McClintock, a civil engineer surveying local properties on behalf of Michael Doherty, one of the main landlords in the area. The attackers fired shots into McClintock&#x27;s bedroom and pelted his house with rocks.

At times, the violence assumed a sectarian character. In January 1861, the Protestant chapel in Clonmany was attacked, with smashed windows and a destroyed door.

During the 1880s, evictions and protests against landlordism became relatively common occurrences. In January 1881, four local men were arrested for unlawful assembly and riotous behaviour after assaulting a bailiff employed by landlord Harvey. A Clonmany branch of the Land League was established, named after the organization&#x27;s founder, Michael Davitt. The activities of the Land League in the area were frequently reported by the Derry Journal, which documented a steady stream of protests and evictions throughout the 1880s.

The local Catholic clergy actively defended tenant rights and, in collaboration with the Land League, advocated on behalf of individual tenants to local landlords. In December 1885, the clergy and Land League representatives met with Mr. Loughrey, a landlord known for his strained relationship with tenants. When the Land League representatives commented on the low value of land, Mr. Loughrey retorted, &quot;the tenants were too cheaply rented, that they wanted to drive me and my family to the workhouse, but I will take steps to draw a good many there along with me.&quot; The Loughrey estate was one of the largest in the area.

Evictions often led to protests. To stop these protests, landlords would often bring in police and soldiers. Sometimes, tenants would owe years of rent before they were evicted. For example, on 1 June 1881, 80 armed police entered Clonmany to oversee a series of evictions organised jointly by four local landlords. The Land League and the local parish priest, Father Maguire, organised a protest march against the evictions. The evictions were a difficult process. Bailiffs were often not sure where properties were located, and they sometimes evicted the wrong people. There were also disputes about whether the rents had been paid. In March 1882, the &quot;Derry Journal&quot; reported that a further 18 evictions had taken place on the Loughrey estate which made over 100 individuals homeless.

The eviction of Catherine Doherty in August 1882 was typical. She was a widow who lived in Cleagh, a townland just outside Clonmany. She had accumulated significant arrears before her landlord took proceedings against her. The &quot;Derry Journal&quot; recorded the event.&quot;The first house visited was that of widow Catherine Doherty. She owed two years&#x27; rent. A writ was served on her in May 1881, Just two days after the rent became due. She tried to have a settlement effected but all in vain. She offered two years&#x27; rent (£8 11s) with half the costs, but that offer was flatly refused by the agent, who would accept nothing less than the entire amount of rent and costs, to be paid before he would leave the house. The Rev. Father O&#x27;Doherty, P.P., Father Maguire, and Father McCullagh were in attendance during the first eviction and reasoned with Mr. Harvey for a long time.

Men were ordered to clear out the furniture. This occupied a considerable time. The usual formalities being gone through of binding up the doors, and giving possession to the agent. The ranks of the soldiers and police were ordered (to) march to Rooskey, where the next eviction was (to) come off. Denis O&#x27;Donnell, three in the family, was the tenant. His time of redemption having expired&quot;

Concerns about the extent of evictions around Clonmany were raised in parliament by the Irish Nationalist MP O&#x27;Donnell. In March 1882, he asked the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he knew about:&quot;the extensive evictions of tenants, for arrears of rent, are taking place, or are about to take place, in the districts of Clonmany, Binnion, Garryduff, Adderville, and Cardonagh, in the county of Donegal; whether it is true that meetings of the inhabitants to protest against these evictions, and to invite public sympathy with poor tenants, on the ground of their incapability to pay the unreduced rents accumulating since the years of distress, have been prohibited by the Government&quot;.In May 1883, Thomas Sexton (the Irish Nationalist MP for Sligo) questioned the conduct of the Royal Irish Constabulary towards evicted tenants in Clonmany in parliament. Mr. Sexton reported that a tenant farmer named Doherty was prevented by the police from erecting huts for evicted families. He stated that 23 families, comprising 108 people, sought refuge in Clonmany, with up to four families sleeping in one small house. Sir George Trevelyan, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, disputed this account, arguing that Doherty wished to build his hut near evicted farms, requiring the police to establish an outpost for property protection, which would incur local costs.

In September 1885, landlords sent &quot;Emergency Men&quot; to claim farms from evicted tenants. After the tenants were removed from their homes, they continued to use the land to grow crops. The &quot;Emergency men&quot; arrived to take possession of these crops. In order to protect these new arrivals, the police were required to station half a dozen men in the district.

Protests often targeted individuals who had assisted in evictions. In July 1888, seven men were accused of interfering with the burial of Patrick Cavanagh. He was a former veteran of the Crimean War who worked on the Loughery estate. Cavanagh had become unpopular after he became the caretaker of the properties of recently evicted tenants. The seven accused men were John O&#x27;Donnell, William Harkin, William Gubbin, Patrick Gubbln, Owen Doherty, from Clonmany; Constantine Doherty, from Cleagh; and Michael Doherty, from Cloontagh. The men filled up the newly dug grave with large stones and prevented the body from entering the graveyard. No one in the village was prepared to supply a coffin for Cavanagh. The local Catholic Clergy begged the demonstrators to allow the burial to proceed. The demonstrators threatened that if the body were buried in the graveyard they would dig it up. Eventually, the Local Government Board issued an administrative order to remove the body for interment in the Carndonagh Workhouse cemetery. The case aroused much interest and was reported widely across the United Kingdom. Two of the accused - Owen Doherty and Constantine Doherty - were found guilty of unlawful assembly and sentenced to six months imprisonment. The remaining men were discharged.

=== First World War ===
The area around Clonmany has strong military associations. In 1914, the British Army opened a training camp named Glenfield Camp, which was located near Glen House, Straid. Up to 5,000 soldiers were garrisoned at Glenfield, including battalions from the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Devonshire Regiment and the Royal Irish Fusiliers.

While stationed at Clonmany, Thomas Rowlands of the 4th Reserve Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry was awarded the Albert Medal for bravery. On 21 October 1918, a grenade with an ignited fuse accidentally fell into the firing bay. Rowlands shouted for the party to take cover and exit the trench. However, one soldier failed to move. Rowlands, displaying great courage, returned to the trench, retrieved the grenade, and threw it over the parapet, where it exploded.

There were also military establishments in Leenan and Dunree. The latter fort was first established during the Napoleonic wars. Both Leenan and Dunree were used to guard the entrance of Loch Swilley, which was used to station part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet. These latter two camps formed part of the Treaty Ports, which the UK Armed Forces continued to use after the Irish Free State was established. These camps were transferred to the Irish Armed Forces in October 1938.

===Irish War of Independence===
The Irish War of Independence (1919-1921) resulted from the Irish people&#x27;s desire for home rule and autonomy. The conflict involved the Irish Republican Army (IRA) using guerrilla warfare against British forces, leading to violence and reprisals. The war ended with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) establishing the Irish Free State.

In early 1920, an IRA company was formed in Clonmany. It was part of the 2nd Battalion of the Donegal IRA based in Carndonagh, which included companies from Clonmany, Culdaff, Malin, Malin Head, and Carndonagh.

In August 1920, the IRA conducted raids to seize firearms from local residents, prompting British forces to raid Clonmany in November 1920. These searches resulted in damage to properties and the discovery of significant amounts of ammunition.

In April 1921, farmer Joseph Doherty of Lenan was found guilty of possessing firearms not under military control. A shotgun was found in his mother&#x27;s home, but Doherty claimed ignorance and suggested it was planted. He refused to acknowledge the court&#x27;s authority, seen as evidence of his affiliation with an illegal society.

One of the most notorious incidents to occur in Clonmany during the conflict took place on 10 May 1921, when two Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) constables, Alexander Clarke and Charles Murdock, were abducted and subsequently murdered by the IRA. Clarke and Murdock, both stationed at the RIC Barracks in Clonmany, were kidnapped while taking an evening walk near Straid. Clarke was shot and thrown into the sea, with his body washing up on the seashore near Binion the following day. Constable Murdock, originally from Dublin, reportedly survived the initial attack, managed to escape, and sought refuge among residents of Binion. However, he was betrayed to the IRA, resulting in his murder. To this day, Murdock&#x27;s body remains undiscovered, although local tradition suggests that he may have been buried in a bog near Binion Hill. In June 1921, a military court convened in Clonmany to conduct a postmortem examination on Constable Clarke. The court concluded that Clarke died from gunshot wounds to the heart, jaw, and neck, and noted the absence of his firearm and ammunition. Clarke was 23 years old and unmarried at the time of his death.

A few days after the murders of Constables Murdock and Clarke, six bridges along the road between Buncrana and Clonmany were destroyed by explosives. This effectively cut off a large part of North Inishowen and delayed the return of Constable Clarke&#x27;s body to England. The authorities had to ask local people to help repair the bridges so that the body could be transported.

Several weeks later, on 10 July 1921, Crown Forces conducted raids on a number of houses in Clonmany in search of Sinn Féin activists. While three young men from the village were initially arrested, they were subsequently released shortly afterwards and allowed to return home.

In July 1921, railway workers stationed at Clonmany railway station refused to transport British soldiers. As a result, the soldiers were removed from the train and sent back to Leenan Fort.

=== Civil War ===
The Irish Civil War, which took place from 1922 to 1923, was a deeply divisive conflict that broke out a few months after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The treaty had established the Irish Free State but left contentious issues unresolved, particularly the question of whether to accept limited independence or push for a complete break from British rule and establish a republic. The conflict pitted anti-treaty irregular forces against the National Army. Ultimately, the National Army emerged victorious, resulting in the establishment of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth.

During the early stages of Irish Civil War, Clonmany was captured by the Free State&#x27;s National Army. A train was commandeered from Buncrana. On 1 July 1922, it moved troops to Clonmany and later to Carndonagh. The capture of Clonmany was peaceful. When the troops arrived in Carndonagh, a gun battle broke out with Anti-Treaty Irregulars, who had taken up positions in the workhouse. The Irregulars agreed to surrender after the Free State Army had opened fire with a machine gun.

=== Second World War ===

During the mid-20th century, a cottage-based textiles industry had developed around Clonmany. During the war, many local women were contracted to make shirts for the British Army. These contracts were allocated to cottage producers by firms in Buncrana and Derry that were unable to manage the large orders from the British War Office.

In August 1940, a body washed up on the shore at Gaddyduff, Clonmany. The body was recovered by Denis Kealey, a farmer&#x27;s son, of Leenan. A postcard was found on the body indicating that the victim was Giovanni Ferdenzi; an Italian migrant to the UK, who lived in Kings Cross. He was previously held at Worth-Mills Internment Camp. The cause of death was heart failure due to exposure. The body was given a Catholic burial at Clonmany. Giovanni was being transported to Canada on SS Arandora Star, which was sunk by a U-boat on 2 July 1940. A second unidentifiable body was washed ashore on Ballyliffin strand.

During the war, mines regularly washed up around the Clonmany shoreline. In June 1942, a mine exploded at Urris. The Irish military also rendered another mine harmless after it washed ashore at Ballyliffin. In March 1946, eight mines were destroyed by the Irish Army after they had floated close to the shoreline between Ballyliffin and Clonmany. The mines appeared after a heavy storm.

=== Post-War period ===
At 2 am on 21 November 1994, the village experienced a minor earthquake. The seismic event measured 2.1 on the Richter Scale.

=== Twenty-first century ===
Clonmany was connected to internet broadband in April 2005.

Seven young local men and a pensioner died in a road accident just outside the village on the evening of 11 July 2010. The event received national media coverage.

== Floods, storms, beaches and dangerous sea currents ==
The village periodically suffers from Atlantic storms causing flooding, particularly after heavy summer rainfall. On 28 May 1892, three hours of torrential rain led to the breaking of Clonmany river banks, flooding hundreds of acres and causing crop and livestock losses. In December 1894, another storm damaged church roofs and blew away thatched cottage roofs, destroying agricultural production.

Significant flooding occurred in 1924. In October 1945, four bridges over the Clonmany river were swept away, dislocating traffic between Clonmany and Buncrana. In September 1952, heavy rain caused the Clonmany riverbanks to break, flooding corn fields, especially around Crossconnell. In August 1952, heavy rain and high tide flooded the village itself. In late August 2017, heavy rains caused severe flooding, with residents being rescued and the R238 road closed. The R238 road, which links the village with Dumfree, was closed after a bridge collapsed. The Irish defense forces were deployed to help with rescue and cleanup efforts. The area was highlighted in the 2014 Flood Risk Assessment Report for potential flood protection due to rising sea levels.

There are several beaches around Clonmany that attract tourists. However, these beaches have dangerous sea currents, posing a risk to swimmers. In August 1945, a 15-year-old boy drowned while bathing at Clonmany Strand. In September 1959, two young men, aged 26 and 15, drowned at Tullagh Beach after encountering difficulties while swimming.

== Places of Interest ==
St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church - An example of a pre-emancipation Catholic Church. The building was started around 1814, with an extension to north to form T- plan built in 1833. A three-stage tower on square-plan was built in 1843.

Clonmany Church of Ireland Parish Church - Located in Straid, just outside the village. Built in 1772 and altered in 1830. The building is now a ruin but is accessible to visitors. The graveyard also contains a number of graves of early eighteenth-century date and maybe earlier, that predates the present edifice and may be associated with an earlier church on the site.

Clonmany Bridge - The Clonmany Bridge, built around 1800, is a triple-arch structure with humpbacked design over the Clonmany River. Constructed using local rubble stone, it features round-headed arches with stone voussoirs, cutwaters, and a crenellated parapet. Despite some modern modifications, the bridge retains its original character and contributes to the scenic rural landscape. It is an important element of the area&#x27;s built and transport heritage, predating the establishment of Clonmany village. The bridge&#x27;s robust construction and picturesque appearance reflect the craftsmanship of the masons involved. It was in existence in 1814, when it is outlined in Revd. Molloy&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Account of the Parish of Clonmany&quot;.

Clehagh Thatched Cottage - Located behind the church, the detached single-storey house, built , showcases traditional architecture. It features a thatched roof with latticed restraining ropes and cast-iron stays. The walls are made of limewashed render on random rubble stone. Historical records from around 1837 show a house on this site.

==Climate==
Clonmany, situated on the Inishowen peninsula and nestled alongside Lough Swilly, benefits from its location with a pleasant and moderate climate. The area experiences temperate, mild summers and winters that rarely dip below freezing temperatures. In terms of average temperatures, this region tends to be warmer than the national average during winter and cooler than the national average during summer.
==Education==
Clonmany and the surrounding area is home to four primary schools. The first one is Clonmany N.S. Another local option is Scoil Naomh Treasa, also known as Tiernasligo N.S. Additionally, there&#x27;s Scoil Phádraig located at Rashenny and Scoil na gCluainte, also referred to as Cloontagh National School. The majority of students from these schools move on to Carndonagh Community School in Carndonagh for their secondary education. Some others opt for Scoil Mhuire or Crana College in Buncrana. There used to be a national school in Crossconnell, which was established in the 19th century. However, it was shut down in the late 1960s.

==Transport==
Clonmany railway station opened on 1 July 1901, but finally closed on 2 December 1935. The station was a stop on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company (The L&amp;LSR, the Swilly) that operated in parts of County Londonderry and County Donegal.

==Culture and tourism==
During the week of the Irish August public holiday, Clonmany hosts an annual event known as the Clonmany Festival. One of the highlights of this festival is the Clonmany Agricultural Show and Sheepdog Trials, which specifically takes place on the Tuesday of the festival week.

Details of local culture, history and traditions were recorded in &quot;The Last of the Name&quot;. A local schoolteacher Patrick Kavanagh (not the poet) wrote down numerous stories remembered by a Clonmany local, Charles McGlinchey.

==Sports==
The Clonmany Tug of War team, formed in 1946, has achieved six world gold medals and twenty All-Ireland titles.

The village&#x27;s soccer team, Clonmany Shamrocks, plays at Shamrocks Park, Gort, Clonmany. During the 2008/2009 season, the club won the Knockalla Caravans Ulster Senior Cup, a competition organized by the Ulster Football Association.

Urris is the local GAA team and the home ground is situated in Straid, Clonmany. The team colors are red and black.

== Folklore ==
Clonmany is associated with a folktale concerning a priest and his encounter with fairies. According to the story, the fairies or the little people are fallen Angels who cannot obtain Christian salvation. A priest is walking on the road from Clonmany to Ballyliffen. He meets a group of fairies who ask him if they can be saved. He throws his prayer book at the fairies who instantly run away. Afterwards, the priest continues on his journey.

<doc id="890528" wikidata="Q1141258" url="?curid=890528" title="Slide (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, a slide is the action of a player, acting as a baserunner, who drops his body to the ground once he is very close to the base he is approaching and slides along the ground to reach the base. Sliding is widely considered to be an essential component of baserunning in both baseball and softball.

A baserunner may slide into a base in a number of different ways and for a number of perceived reasons, including to avoid a tag out, to avoid overrunning the base, and to interfere or avoid contact with the defensive player protecting the base. Players determine whether they will benefit by sliding in a particular game situation. Adult amateur players may also consider the question of whether or not the increased risk of injury will make a slide worthwhile.

Players generally slide feet-first but sometimes also use a head-first technique. Strictly speaking, going headfirst into a base constitutes more of a dive than a slide, but the term &quot;slide&quot; is still commonly used. This alternate method has been used in Major League Baseball at least since the middle-1880s when the innovation was popularized by the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. Yet even in the majors, it remained relatively uncommon until it became popularized by Pete Rose in the 1960s. Headfirst sliding has since become a common practice for various players on all levels of professional baseball, but it is often restricted on the amateur level.

==Reasons for sliding==
===Avoiding a tag out===

On plays in which the baserunner may be tagged out by the opposing defensive player covering the base, the baserunner&#x27;s body being down on the ground presents the lowest-profile target for the defensive player to tag. This makes it slightly more difficult for the defensive player to apply the tag in time to put out the baserunner.

===Avoiding overrunning the base===
Sliding helps a runner stop his forward momentum through the friction created between the body and the ground, thus reducing the likelihood that he will run past the base after touching it. This is important because in most cases a runner is in jeopardy of being tagged out if he loses contact with the base (the most common exception is that a batter-runner may overrun first base when initially reaching that base as long as he immediately returns to first base without attempting to advance to second base). Because the runner must balance the need to reach a base as quickly as possible with the need to avoid overrunning the base, sliding provides a rapid means for the runner to decelerate, allowing the baserunner to run at top speed as long as possible before needing to slow down.

===Interfering with the defensive player (take-out slide)===

Sliding can sometimes be used as a means of interfering with the play of the opposing defensive player who is covering the base being approached. For example, when it is possible that a double play might occur, and the baserunner approaching second base has already been put out, he might still try to slide toward the defensive player who intends to throw the ball to first base. If the defensive player moves away from second base as he prepares to throw the ball toward first, the baserunner may still slide directly toward the defensive player, even though that means sliding &quot;away&quot; from second base itself. This has the effect of hampering that defensive player&#x27;s ability to complete the play, either directly by making physical contact with him, or indirectly by distracting him by making him fearful of such contact. A slide performed exclusively for the purpose of hampering the play of the defense is called a &quot;take-out slide&quot;.

Whether a particular instance of a take-out slide is legal within the rules of baseball is a judgement call made by the umpire, usually based upon how close the baserunner comes to the base they are approaching during the slide. If a baserunner strays too far from the base when attempting a take-out slide, the umpire may declare the slide to be an example of illegal interference and call an extra out. As a general (but not absolute) guideline, even if the baserunner clearly slides toward the defensive player and away from the base, so long as the baserunner comes close enough to the base that he is able to touch it with some part of his body during the slide, the slide will be ruled to be legal. On the flip side, the fielder will often be granted the neighborhood play under such circumstances.

===Avoiding collision or injury from errant throw===
Particularly for younger players, proper sliding technique has been shown to protect the runner and fielder from colliding and can prevent the runner from being hit by an errant throw. For this reason, most youth baseball leagues now advise teaching proper sliding technique at a young age and urge kids to slide feet-first into any base (except first base) whenever there is a potentially close play. This concept is somewhat more controversial in adult amateur baseball/softball leagues since the risk of injury from sliding increases with age.

==Speed impact of sliding==

The television series &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested participants&#x27; baserunning speed with and without sliding, and found that in cases where the runner needs to stop on the base, sliding into that base instead of staying upright provided a split second of advantage, suggesting the more rapid deceleration as the key. However, when removing the need to stop, the general belief within baseball circles is that remaining upright and running all the way to the base at top speed allows a baserunner to reach the base faster than sliding. Consequently, on plays during which neither being tagged out nor being put in jeopardy by overrunning the base is at issue (e.g., when approaching first base after having batted the ball and nobody is trying to make a tag play), players are usually advised not to slide. Nonetheless, this conventional wisdom is not universally accepted, and as such, some players may feel that sliding will get them to the base more quickly and will thus choose to do so despite advice to the contrary.

==Risks associated with sliding==
One study in &quot;The American Journal of Sports Medicine&quot; followed seven softball and three baseball teams in Division I of the NCAA, and found the overall incidence of injuries sustained while sliding was 9.51 per 1000 slides. Softball players had about twice the incidence of sliding injuries as baseball players in the study. 11% (four out of 37) of the injuries caused the player to miss more than 7 days of participation.

Because baseball shoes are spiked on the bottom, sliding with the spikes up increases the probability of injury to the defensive player covering the base. Knowledge of this fact can often increase the defensive player&#x27;s fear of the possible contact from an impending slide and thus increase his distraction while attempting to make a play.

<text>A private island is a disconnected body of land wholly owned by a private citizen or corporation. Although this exclusivity gives the owner substantial control over the property, private islands remain under the jurisdiction of national and sometimes local governments. Their size can vary widely, from that of a typical suburban yard to several hundred square kilometers.

==Geographic distribution==
Southeast Asia has numerous islands, with Indonesia being an archipelago of 17,000 islands and the Philippines having around 7,100. Real estate laws restrict foreigners&#x27; ability to buy property in the geographical area, and many islands either have unclear ownership rights or are already settled. Private islands that are available in Southeast Asia&#x27;s real estate market are also prohibitively costly due to being in high demand by hotel developers. Developments address these difficulties by selling private islands that have villas and neighbor islands that have high-end hotels; the proximity keeps costs of habitation down.

Europe has hundreds of thousands of islands, many of which are privately owned. With 17,000 islands in Finland, 221,831 islands in Sweden and thousands in Croatia, Europe is increasingly becoming a hotspot for private island holidays. Many islands, although privately owned, are not suitable for development due to legal and governmental restrictions or due to the physical characteristics of the island.

The Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean feature a number of private islands, typically run as sheep raising family farms and tourist destinations. Prominent among these is Weddell Island, one of the largest private islands in the world, with a surface area of . While the Hawaiian island of Lanai is still bigger at , technically it might not qualify as part of its territory (about 2%) does not belong to the principal owner.

Swains Island in the Tokelau archipelago has been owned by the family of Eli Hutchinson Jennings since 1856. In the late 1910s, the U.S. and Britain agreed that the island fell under U.S. jurisdiction, and in 1925 it was administratively joined with American Samoa. In the 1950s, after a labor dispute between the Jennings family and workers on its copra plantation, a form of local government was established for the island, but the Jennings&#x27;s ownership of the entire island was affirmed.

==Ownership==
Virtually all islands in the world are claimed and governed by some national government. That nation&#x27;s laws apply, and any attempt by the owner to claim sovereignty would generally be unrealistic. Nevertheless, some people still try to set up their own micronations on islands, like real-estate millionaire Michael Oliver&#x27;s attempt at building a libertarian city-state called the Republic of Minerva in the southern Pacific Ocean. There are widely varying government policies regarding private islands: for instance, islands off the coast of China, like any other land within the country, cannot be purchased outright, but only leased from the government for a maximum period of 50 years.

&quot;Private&quot; islands in the United Kingdom, Brazil, Chile and some other countries are not always legally entirely privatein some cases foreshore, such as a beach, is owned by the government, and is hence publicly accessible property, despite what the owners of the land on the island may wish to claim. The same applies to freedom to roam in Nordic countries: only the yard of a house and the immediate vicinity is legally protected against trespassing, and the water bodies around the island are freely navigable.

There are many thousands of uninhabited islands in the world with potential for commercial development of tourist resorts or private recreational use. Some islands can be bought undeveloped, while others already have roads and/or houses. Islands are also available for rent. Many celebrities have their own private islands.

Commercial development of uninhabited islands can raise ecological concerns, as many have a fragile environment.

==Real estate==
The real estate market for private islands varies globally. Prices tend to be lower in Nova Scotia, parts of Michigan and Maine, and parts of Central America; and higher in Europe, the Bahamas, and Oceanic countries like French Polynesia. Islands with amenities have higher market value and are not sold as frequently. Some are available for travelers to rent, a trend which increased in the 2000s with economic recession making it more difficult for some owners to maintain them.

In the 2000s, the United States housing bubble increased the cost-per-acre for private islands. The effect was fueled by the advent of the Internet, which provided greater access to island inventories. Conservation groups&#x27; efforts to restrict development reduced the supply of private islands in the market, raising prices.

===Cruise lines===
Since 1992 a number of cruise lines have acquired &quot;private islands&quot; to offer their customers exclusive beach experiences. Such islands (or sections thereof) were further developed to have restaurants and perhaps additional attractions such as parasailing, waterparks, zip lines, horseback riding, spas and more. Some islands have piers, others are reached by tender. The purchase of an island allows the cruise line to achieve greater control over the venue and to influence the quality of experience of their passengers. Certain private islands may be used not only by the cruise line that bought the property but also by associated lines.

<text>Harry Duffield Stovey (&quot;né&quot; Stowe; December 20, 1856 – September 20, 1937) was an American 19th-century Major League Baseball player and the first player in major league history to hit 100 home runs. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Stovey played for fourteen seasons in the majors and was appointed player-manager on two separate occasions during his career.

Known today as both a prolific home run hitter and base-stealer, he led the league in both categories multiple times in his career, including a season record of fourteen home runs in and a league-leading 97 stolen bases in . He stole 509 bases in his career, which is tied for 35th all-time; among players who played in fifteen seasons or less, he ranks sixth. Stovey finished in the top ten in home runs eleven times (1880–1886, 1888–1991), which included time in three leagues; he led a league in home runs five times. He also finished in the top ten in runs scored ten times, batting average six times, and on-base percentage seven times. He was the first to wear sliding pads and among the first to slide feet first.

==Baseball career==
===Philadelphia Defiance===
In 1877, Harry began his career in the pitcher’s box and graduated out of the ranks of a Philadelphia amateur team called the Defiance (the Philadelphia Defiance were a professional team, part of the league Alliance).

===New Bedford===
In 1878, Frank Bancroft, owner/manager of the New Bedford Baseball Club, engaged Stovey to join his pitching staff. When the New Bedfords&#x27; John Piggot, first baseman, became ill during their first exhibition game of the season, Stovey was asked to take over, and played brilliantly enough that he replaced Piggott as the starting first basemen for the entire season.

===Worcester===
Harry was an outfielder / first baseman in for the Worcester Worcesters under the surname of Stovey instead of his birth name of Stowe due to his desire to keep his family from discovering he was making his career at baseball, which was seen at the time as not a respectable profession. He made an immediate impact that first season, leading the league with 14 triples and six home runs, while also finishing in the top ten in many other offensive categories. On July 17, he hit his first major league home run off Jim McCormick of the Cleveland Blues.

For the season, his offensive numbers did not slow down, again finishing in the top ten in several offensive categories, though he did not lead the league in any this time around. On August 17, 1881, Worcester suspended Captain Mike Dorgan‚ and Stovey took over the position for the remainder of the season. Lee Richmond‚ who had quit because of conflicts with Dorgan‚ rejoined the team after this switch.

In , his last season for the Worcesters, his batting average saw an increase, up to .289 from .270 the year before, but his numbers in relation to the rest of the league took a slight dip. He ranked third in the league in runs scored, with 90, and fourth in the league in home runs, with five.

===Philadelphia===

For the season, Stovey moved on to play for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association, and it was during the next seven years when he had his best years, and made his greatest impact on the game. His first season in Philadelphia saw him set the single season record for home runs with fourteen, breaking the old mark of nine set by Charley Jones in . That year, the Athletics won the league pennant, doing so with a record of 66–32 beating St. Louis by one game. Stovey kept this record for only one season, as Ned Williamson set a new mark the very next season with 27. Not only did he set the home run record, he batted .306, and led the league in runs scored with 110, doubles with 31, and games played with 112, while also finishing in the top five in most offensive categories. It was also the first of nine straight seasons where he collected 200+ total bases and 100+ runs scored.

The offensive explosiveness continued throughout his stay in Philadelphia, leading the league in runs scored four times, doubles once, triples three times, and home runs three times. The accumulation of home runs led him to become the career home run leader, overtaking Charley Jones with his 51st career homer on September 28, . He held onto the career lead for a season until he was passed for a short period of time by Dan Brouthers for the and the  seasons. Stovey regained the lead, and held it until Roger Connor passed him in . 1886 was the first season with recordable data for stolen bases (albeit without caught stealing). That year, he led the league with 68 stolen bases.

===Boston===
In , the Players&#x27; League, a rival league to the National League and the American Association, began, and it attracted many of the game&#x27;s star players, including Stovey who &quot;jumped&quot; to the Boston Reds. He had a good season, batting .299, hit eleven triples, and twelve home runs while totaling 97 stolen bases. On September 3, 1890, Stovey became the first player to hit 100 homers for a career, off Jersey Bakley in a game against Cleveland, a significant milestone in a day when home runs were relatively rare. The Reds won the league pennant with a record of 81–48 (6½ games over Brooklyn) to garner Stovey&#x27;s second league championship.

After the 1890 season, the Players&#x27; League folded with many of the players returning to their former ballclubs. Stovey‚ who played with the Athletics in 1889, was not claimed by that club through a clerical error, so on February 5, 1891, he signed with the Boston Beaneaters of the National League. In 134 games, he led the league that season with sixteen home runs and twenty triples, while also hitting .279 with 31 doubles as well. It proved to be last great season of his career.

===Baltimore / Brooklyn===
Stovey played only 38 games for the Beaneaters in , before he was released on June 20, but he was quickly signed by the Baltimore Orioles. He finished the season with a .272 batting average with the Orioles and hit eleven triples, including three in one game on July 21 in a 10–3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. In a total of 112 games, he batted .235/.326/.371 with 101 hits and 67 RBIs.

The season was Stovey&#x27;s last season in the majors, playing 56 total games. He was released by the Orioles on May 22 after only eight games, and was signed three days later on May 15 by the Brooklyn Grooms. He finished the season with the Grooms and retired after the season was over.

===Career statistics===
In 1,489 games over fourteen seasons, Stovey posted a .288 batting average (1,775-for-6,153) with 1,495 runs, 348 doubles, 176 triples, 122 home runs, 912 RBI, 509 stolen bases, and 664 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .943 fielding percentage playing the outfield and first base.

==Post-career==
After his career, Stovey returned to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he had begun his baseball career, in order to manage the local amateur team in 1893. He subsequently worked as a police officer in the city. Stovey died at the age of 80 in New Bedford, and is interred at Oak Grove Cemetery.

The Nineteenth Century Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research named Stovey the Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend for 2011 — a 19th-century player, manager, executive or other baseball personality not yet inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

<doc id="890532" wikidata="Q1806924" url="?curid=890532" title="Mercury Villager">
<text>The Mercury Villager is a minivan that was marketed by Mercury from 1993 to 2002. Taking its name used by Mercury to denote its wood-trimmed station wagons, the Villager was developed in a joint venture between Ford and Nissan; the latter manufacturer marketed the line as the Nissan Quest. The first front-wheel drive van produced by Ford, the Mercury Villager was introduced between the Ford Aerostar and the Ford Windstar, competing against Chrysler minivans and the General Motors APV minivans. 

Two generations of the model line were produced, with the Villager undergoing a full redesign for 1999. In a first for the minivan segment, the model line replaced a removable rear seat with a design that was repositionable (dependent on passenger or cargo use). The Villager was the last Mercury developed with the lightbar grille used by the brand. 

The Villager was produced alongside the Nissan Quest by Ford at its Ohio Assembly facility (Avon Lake, Ohio) alongside the Ford Econoline/Club Wagon. After 2002, the Ford-Nissan joint venture ended, with both companies developing minivans on their own. Nissan released a new generation of the Quest, while the Villager was replaced entirely; for 2004, Mercury released a revived Monterey as its second minivan (a divisional counterpart of the Ford Freestar). 
== Background ==

===Nameplate===
The Edsel division of Ford introduced the Villager nameplate for the 1958 model year, with the Edsel Villager serving as its mid-range station wagon. Offered in a four-door configuration with a fully-painted exterior, the Villager was marketed through the 1960 model year. Following the demise of Edsel, Mercury reintroduced the Villager nameplate for the 1962 model year as part of the Comet compact series. Again denoting a station wagon, the Comet Villager was offered with simulated woodgrain trim.

From 1962 to 1984, Mercury marketed the Villager as the Mercury counterpart of the Ford &quot;Squire&quot; trim, denoting wood-trim station wagons (excluding the full-size Mercury Colony Park). The Comet Villager was produced from 1962 to 1967 and was followed by five more uses of the Villager name, including the Montego (1970–1976), Bobcat (1975–1980), Cougar (1977 and 1982), Zephyr (1978–1981) and Lynx (1981–1984).

Following the introduction of the 1983 Marquis, the Villager nameplate was dropped from wood-trim station wagons; while offered with wood trim, the Marquis adopted the Brougham name (the Mercury Sable that replaced it was never offered with the option).

=== Development ===

At the beginning of 1988, Ford and Nissan entered a joint venture to develop an all-new minivan sold by both automakers. Under the terms of the agreement, the development and engineering of the vehicles was done by Nissan (in the United States); the company also supplied the engine and transmission. Ford would manufacture the vehicles in its own facility, providing components for the vehicle.

Development officially commenced later that year, codenamed VX54. The program would replace two existing Nissan product lines developed in Japan (the Van and the Axxess) and Ford would market its version as a Mercury (the VX54 program coincided with the simultaneous development of the WIN88 program, later the Ford Windstar). The final designs were chosen by Nissan in 1989, with both companies commencing testing of prototypes in 1990; real-world testing was done through 1991, as development concluded at the end of that year.

During the 1980s, family-use vehicles transitioned from full-size station wagons towards minivans. In place of the full-size Mercury Colony Park, during the development process, designers benchmarked the mid-size as its goal for features, ride, and handling. Along with deriving the front lightbar grille from the Sable, the Villager adopted its two-way liftgate (hatchback rear window) from the station wagon.

While all-wheel drive was initially planned in the VX54 program, slow sales of Chrysler AWD minivans led to Ford dropping it from development of the Villager.
==First generation (1993–1998)==
Launched in July 1992 as a 1993 model, the Mercury Villager was introduced at the 1992 Chicago Auto Show. Introduced alongside the Nissan Quest, the 1992 Mercury Villager was the first Mercury since 1960 produced without a Ford counterpart.

=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Villager uses the front-wheel drive Ford VX54 platform. While using a Ford codename, the platform is an evolution of the 1989-1994 Nissan Maxima (J30 chassis). Using a 112.2-inch wheelbase, the chassis shares nearly an identical wheelbase with a standard-wheelbase 1984-1995 Chrysler minivan (an inch longer than a short-wheelbase Chevrolet Astro).

The Villager uses MacPherson struts for the front suspension and leaf springs for the solid rear axle. The front brakes were vented discs with rear drums (Rear disc brakes were included on models equipped with the trailer towing package); anti-lock brakes were fitted as standard equipment.

==== Powertrain ====
The first-generation Villager (and its Quest counterpart) was powered by a single engine through its production. Sharing its engine with the Nissan Maxima, the Villager was powered by a 3.0L Nissan VG30E V6 (detuned from 160 to 151 horsepower). A Jatco-supplied 4-speed automatic was the sole transmission offering.

In the development of the VX54 model line, Ford requested several design changes from Nissan before it would use the engine. Along with making the VG30E a non-interference engine, Ford requested the addition of an oil level sensor and the relocation of the oil filter assembly (for better access).

=== Body design ===

At 190 inches long, the first-generation Villager nearly matches the extended-length 1991–1995 Chrysler minivans in length. In contrast to the Aerostar, the Villager was produced solely as a passenger van and in a single body length. All versions were produced with single sliding door.

In line with the Mercury Sable and Mercury Topaz sedans, the Villager was distinguished from its Nissan Quest counterpart by its front lightbar grille. While the Quest was styled with a monochromatic exterior (for all trims), the Villager used multiple two-toned exterior trims (base trims used wide gray moldings, in line with the 1992 Grand Marquis). To aid aerodynamics, the exterior door handles were faired into the doors. In a minivan first, the rear liftgate was modeled after compact station wagons; the rear window opened independently from the door.

For 1996, the exterior underwent a mid-cycle revision. A conventional grille (modeled after the Sable and Mystique) replaced the lightbar, with restyled taillamps (joined by a red panel), badging, and the introduction of monochromatic exterior trim (for lower trims).

While the exterior and interior of the vehicle was designed primarily by Nissan, many interior components were sourced from Ford. In line with the Aerostar, the Villager was equipped with optional rear-seat radio controls and air-conditioning vents. Along with folding/removable second-row seats (bench or bucket, dependent on trim), the third-row bench seat was mounted on sliding tracks, allowing the interior to be reconfigured (for passengers or cargo) without its removal. To meet passive-restraint requirements, the Villager was initially equipped with automatic seatbelts (the only American-market minivan to do so); for 1994, a driver-side airbag was added, with dual airbags becoming standard for 1996 (replacing the automatic seatbelts).

=== Trim ===

For 1993, the Villager was offered with &quot;GS&quot; and &quot;LS&quot; trim levels, in line with Mercury sedans. The second-row seat of the GS was a two-passenger bench seat; the LS was available with either a bench seat or two bucket seats. At its launch, the exterior of the GS was produced with wide gray door/bumper moldings (similar to the 1992 Grand Marquis), switching to monochromatic trim for the 1996 model year (with optional two-tone trim); the LS was offered with standard two-tone trim from 1993 to 1998.

==== Villager Nautica ====

In 1994, Mercury introduced the &quot;Nautica&quot; special edition of the Villager. In line with Eddie Bauer-edition Ford vehicles (including the Aerostar minivan), the trim denoted the namesake clothing company. Externally denoted by a blue-and-white color scheme (with a yellow pinstripe), the Nautica was fitted with multi-color leather seats (blue with white inserts); a complimentary luggage set included Nautica-designed duffel bags. For the 1996, multiple two-tone color schemes joined the blue/white exterior.
==Second generation (1999–2002)==
For the 1999 model year, Mercury introduced the second-generation Villager. Again a counterpart of the Nissan Quest, the 1999 Villager shared no sheetmetal with its predecessor. As with the larger Ford Windstar, a central change of the redesign included the addition of a second sliding door.

=== Chassis specification ===
Carried over from the previous generation, the Ford VX54 platform underpinned the second-generation Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest, sharing its 112.2-inch wheelbase. Retuned for a softer ride, the second-generation Villager retained its suspension configuration from the previous generation, including front MacPherson struts and a rear beam axle. The front brakes were vented discs with rear drum brakes; ABS was offered as an option.

==== Powertrain ====
The second-generation Villager received a new V6 engine, again supplied by Nissan. For 1999, the 3.3L VG33E V6 replaced the previous 3.0L V6; producing 170 hp, the engine was shared with Nissan light trucks and SUVs in the United States. A Jatco-supplied 4-speed automatic was the sole transmission paired with the engine.

=== Body design ===

While sharing its wheelbase with its predecessor, the second-generation Villager was five inches longer than its predecessor; slightly larger than the Toyota Sienna, the Villager was approximately six inches shorter than the extended-length GM and Chrysler minivans (and the Ford Windstar). In contrast to its competitors (except the Chrysler Town &amp; Country), the second-generation Villager/Quest was sold solely with two sliding doors, abandoning the previous single side-door configuration.

While again sharing most body stampings, the exterior of the second-generation Quest and Villager were designed separately, with Ford designer Moray Callum responsible for the exterior of the Villager. In place of the chrome-ringed horizontal grille, the Villager adopted a waterfall-style grille (with a much larger Mercury emblem); the rear fascia was given a red trim panel between the taillamps (with amber turn signals). Several design features from the first generation made a return, including the design of the exterior door handles and the two-way rear liftgate.

Carrying over the reconfigurable 3rd-row seat design from the previous generation, the cargo area was revised with the addition of a removable parcel shelf. For 2000, a 3-person 2nd-row seat was introduced (increasing capacity to 8) as an option. As a $1,295 option, a rear-seat entertainment system was introduced, including a flip-down LCD screen connected to a VCR or video-game console.

For 2001, the front and rear fascias were revised; the Mercury emblem was centered and enlarged on the grille and liftgate (the foglamps were changed to round lenses). The instrument panel was redesigned (the electronic instrument panel returned as an option). 

=== Trim ===

Abandoning the GS/LS trim nomenclature used by the previous generation, the second-generation Villager was offered in three trim levels: Villager, Villager Sport, and Villager Estate; the special-edition Nautica trim was discontinued. Externally, the standard Villager was offered in monochromatic colors or with a silver lower body; the Sport was painted with a gray lower body and received upgraded suspension settings and larger wheels and tires. The Estate was distinguished by a gold lower body, wheels, and badging.

==Sales==
== Chinese production ==
From 1995 to 2001, the first-generation Mercury Villager was marketed by Chinese auto manufacturers through the use of CKD kits. Guangzhou Yunbao (today part of Dongfeng Fengshen) marketed the Yunbao YB6480; traditionally using CKD vehicles from Nissan, the YB6480 retained its Mercury badging. As largely the same vehicle, Dongfeng Fengshen marketed the Villager as the Fengshen EQ6482. While the bodies were manufactured in the United States (for CKD purposes), the engines were manufactured in China (marketed through manufacturers in joint ventures with Nissan).

Through its passenger car division, Guangdong Bus Works produced the GDK6480; with nearly all assembly completed in the United States, only a few parts were added to the vehicle in China.

== Replacement == 
In 2000, Ford and Nissan chose to end their joint venture, as both companies had commenced design work on new generations of the Ford Windstar and the Nissan Quest. Following a shortened 2002 model year, the Ford-Nissan joint venture was concluded. The final Mercury Villager was assembled on June 27, 2002.

After skipping the 2003 model year, both Mercury and Nissan were to reenter the minivan segment. A third generation of the Quest was developed and manufactured by Nissan in the United States (derived from the Maxima), while Mercury replaced the Villager with the Monterey, a counterpart of the Freestar (as Ford had renamed the Windstar), intended to compete directly against the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.

<text>Tseng Kuan-jung (, ), professionally known as Dwagie (), is a Taiwanese rapper, best known for using Taiwanese in his performances. His first solo album, &quot;Lotus from the Tongue&quot; (舌粲蓮花, 2002), was billed as the first full rap album in the Chinese-speaking world. He has also collaborated with fellow rapper MC HotDog.

Outside of the hip hop scene he is best known for his best-selling single, &quot;Taiwan Song&quot;, which projects an unapologetic Taiwanese assertiveness. The title is a playful pun on the Mandarin word for &quot;ode&quot; (頌, pinyin: sòng), which also sounds like a Taiwanese word for &quot;feeling good&quot; (爽, POJ: sóng), as well as the English word &quot;song&quot;.

The 8 March 2004 Asian issue of &quot;Time&quot; describes him as a writer of &quot;pro-Taiwan rap&quot; and the &quot;poster boy of the DPP&#x27;s southern youth vote campaign&quot; during the 2004 presidential election. He was also featured in a segment of the 2007 Discovery Channel special &quot;The Mystical Tainan&quot; (謎樣台南). He became a proponent of humane treatment for stray animals in 2009, and has featured their point of view in his music. Dwagie supports trap, neuter, release programs in Taiwan, and has collaborated with others, such as , Yang Lie, and Su Tseng-chang, to film public service announcements on stray cats, in DVD and online form.

In 2014, he collaborated with Nas on the track &quot;Refuse to Listen&quot;. In 2016, he collaborated with Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan on the track &quot;Words to Trump&quot;.

<doc id="890573" wikidata="Q506533" url="?curid=890573" title="Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein">
<text>Karl I (30 July 1569 – 12 February 1627) was the first member of the Liechtenstein family to become a monarch of Liechtenstein; thus, he was the founder of the Princely Family of Liechtenstein.

Karl was the elder son of Hartmann II, Baron of Liechtenstein (1544–1585) and his wife, Countess Anna Maria of Ortenburg (1547–1601). Emperor Rudolf II of the Holy Roman Empire appointed Karl as chief intendant (&quot;Obersthofmeister&quot;), an important position at his court. Karl held this position until 1607. In a dispute over land between Rudolf II and the heir presumptive to the throne, Archduke Matthias, Karl sided with Matthias. Liechtenstein played a leading role as adviser and supporter of Matthias in the coup against Emperor Rudolf II. Now-Hungarian King Matthias made him a hereditary prince in 1608, in thanks for Karl&#x27;s aid. In his politics and assertiveness as advisor to Matthias, he rivaled Melchior Khlesl, Bishop of Vienna, who ultimately prevailed over Liechtenstein and became the new minister-favourite of King and later Emperor Matthias.

In 1614, Karl added the Duchy of Troppau to his possessions. In thanks for further aid at the Battle of White Mountain, Karl was appointed to the positions of proconsul and vice-regent of Bohemia in 1622, and he was bestowed with the Order of the Golden Fleece.

He gained the Duchy of Troppau on 28 December 1613 and the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf on 15 March 1622, along with much confiscated &quot;rebel property&quot;, and he commissioned the ducal hat of Liechtenstein.

He became a Catholic in 1599. In 1605, Karl established the first branch north of the Alps of the Hospitaller Order of Saint John of God, at Feldsberg in Lower Austria (now Valtice, Czech Republic).

He was the 352nd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria. He died in Prague.

<text>Karl Eusebius (11 April 1611 – 5 April 1684) was the Prince of Liechtenstein. He inherited this title in 1627 from his father Karl I. He was 16 and thus considered underage, and his uncles Prince Gundakar and Maximillian acted as regents until 1632. From 1639 to 1641 Karl was Chief Captain of High and Low Silesia.

After the Thirty Years&#x27; War Karl effectively restored his dominions economically. Karl was also an extensive patron of architecture of the period. He formed the early plans for Plumlov Castle, which in fact his son the future Hans-Adam I oversaw the construction of.

He died in Schwarzkosteletz.

==Marriage and issue==
Karl married his niece, Princess Johanna Beatrix von Dietrichstein-Nikolsburg ( – 26 March 1676) on 6 August 1644. They had nine children:

*Princess Eleonora Maria (1647 – 7 August 1704).
*Princess Anna Maria (1648–1654).
*Princess Maria Theresia (1649–1716).
*Princess Johanna Beatrix (1650–1672); Married Maximilian II, Prince of Liechtenstein (1641–1709).
*Prince Franz Dominik (died 1652).
*Prince Karl Joseph (died 1653).
*Prince Franz Eusebius (1654–1655).
*Princess Cecilia (died 1655).
*Prince Johann Adam Andreas (known as Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein) (1662–1712).

== In popular culture ==
Karl Eusebius plays a prominent role in several of the works in the &quot;1632&quot; series of alternative history novels and stories.

<text>Sanda Ladoși (; born 2 January 1970 in Târgu Mureș) is a Romanian singer.

As a child, Sanda sang in various choirs and groups. Near the age of 10 she began to study music and learned piano, classical guitar and singing. Since she was born into a family of teachers, she pursued studies in education. However, she gave up her teaching career almost as soon as she graduated from Târgu Mureș. She moved to Bucharest to follow her dream of becoming a professional singer, while also studying law at the city&#x27;s Titu Maiorescu University.

She has performed duets with Romanian stars such as Marcel Pavel, Ștefan Iordache, Ioan Gyuri Pascu, and Aurelian Temișan. She has performed at many concerts across Romania and at a great number of summer festivals abroad. She has released five albums to date and toured worldwide. She released her fifth album &quot;Khalini&quot; in 2006, which includes the song &quot;I Admit&quot;. With &quot;I Admit&quot;, she won in 2004 the Romanian National Selection for the Eurovision Song Contest at Istanbul. In the international finals, she came in 18th.

Sanda was also chosen to dub Mulan in the series &quot;Sofia the First&quot;.

<doc id="890587" wikidata="Q7604652" url="?curid=890587" title="Statute of Monopolies">
<text>The Statute of Monopolies (21 Jas. 1. c. 3) was an act of the Parliament of England notable as the first statutory expression of English patent law. Patents evolved from letters patent, issued by the monarch to grant monopolies over particular industries to skilled individuals with new techniques. Originally intended to strengthen England&#x27;s economy by making it self-sufficient and promoting new industries, the system gradually became seen as a way to raise money (through charging patent-holders) without having to incur the public unpopularity of a tax. Elizabeth I particularly used the system extensively, issuing patents for common commodities such as starch and salt. Unrest eventually persuaded her to turn the administration of patents over to the common law courts, but her successor, James I, used it even more. Despite a committee established to investigate grievances and excesses, Parliament made several efforts to further curtail the monarch&#x27;s power. The result was the Statute of Monopolies, passed on 29 May 1624.

The statute repealed some past and future patents and monopolies but preserved exceptions: one of these was for patents for novel inventions. Seen as a key moment in the evolution of patent law, the statute has also been described as &quot;one of the landmarks in the transition of [England&#x27;s] economy from the feudal to the capitalist&quot;. Even with the statute in force, it took over a century for a comprehensive legal doctrine around patents to come into existence, and James I&#x27;s successor Charles I regularly abused the patents system by ensuring that all cases relating to his actions were heard in conciliar courts, which he controlled. The English Civil War and the resulting English Restoration finally curtailed this system. The statute is still the basis for Australian law, and until the United Kingdom began following the European Patent Convention in 1977, was also a strong pillar of the United Kingdom&#x27;s intellectual property law.

==Background==

Historically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents as a form of economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law developed around patents. This practice came from the guilds, groups who were controlled by the Crown and held monopolies over particular industries. By the 14th century the economy of England was lagging behind that of other European nations, with the guilds too small to control industrial production successfully. To remedy this, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering &quot;letters of protection&quot; that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The first recorded letter of protection was given in 1331. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as an extended passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. An exceptional example (considered the first full patent in England) was issued to John of Utynam on 3 April 1449, granting him a monopoly. Overseas, the practice of granting full industrial patents and monopolies became common in Italian states by the 1420s.

Over the next century, the granting of full industrial patents became a more common practice in England; the next record is a letter from 1537 to Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII&#x27;s private secretary, from Antonio Guidotti, a Venetian silk-merchant. Guidotti had persuaded a group of Venetian silk-makers to practice in England, and wanted the king to grant him letters patent protecting their monopoly to grow silk for 15 or 20 years. This was granted, and Henry&#x27;s son Edward VI followed up with a grant of letters patent to Henry Smyth, who hoped to introduce foreign glassworking techniques into England. This process continued after Elizabeth I came to the throne, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch, both before and after the Statute of Monopolies, because of the potential for raising revenue. A patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest as a result of the patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.

Over time, this became more and more problematic; instead of temporary monopolies on specific, imported industries, long-term monopolies came about over more common commodities, including salt and starch. These &quot;odious monopolies&quot; led to a showdown between the Crown and Parliament, in which it was agreed in 1601 to turn the power to administer patents over to the common law courts; at the same time, Elizabeth revoked a number of the more restrictive and damaging monopolies. Even given a string of judicial decisions criticising and overruling such monopolies, James I, Elizabeth I&#x27;s successor, continued using patents to create monopolies. Despite the Committee of Grievances, a body chaired by Sir Edward Coke that abolished a large number of monopolies, a wave of protest occurred at the expansion of the system. On 27 March 1621, James suggested the House of Commons draw up a list of the three most objectionable patents, and he would &quot;give Life to it, without alteration&quot;, but by this time a statute was already being prepared by Coke. After passing on 12 May 1621 it was thrown out by the House of Lords, but a Statute of Monopolies was finally passed by Parliament on 29 May 1624.

==Act==
===Sections 1–5===
Section 1 said that:

Crucially, this rendered all past, present and future patents and monopolies null and void. Patents were normally divided into three categories; patents for a particular invention, patents exempting a patent-holder from legislation, and patents for a particular trade or industry. Section 1, however, for the first time discussed a new category of patents; those &quot;of Power, Liberty or Faculty&quot;. These patents were normally used in relation to penal laws, to &quot;farm out&quot; the business of administering to criminals and dispensing justice to private companies and individuals. The statute, in a break from previous law, emphasised that this power lay only within Parliament. Section 2 provided that all future patents granted should be determined by the common law, and not otherwise, while Section 3 emphasised that companies and individuals now or in the future in possession of patents should not be allowed to exercise them. Sections 4 and 5 provided that if anyone was interfered with 40 days after the Statute of Monopolies was passed due to a patent or monopoly, any goods seized or persons imprisoned would be returned to their owners and released respectively.

Section 5 was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863.

===Sections 6–9===

The most important part of the statute is Section 6, which lays out the exceptions to the rules preventing any kind of monopoly or patent. It stated that the previous provisions:

Essentially, this established a wide area in which patents could be granted, on the condition that monopolies lasted no longer than 14 years. These patents would apply to any new &quot;manner&quot; of &quot;manufacture&quot;, with &quot;manufacture&quot; referring both to the creation of an object, and the design for that object. Section 7 provided that the Act did not prejudice or overrule any previous statutory measures, while Section 8 provided that the restoration to Parliament of the power to administer penal law did not in any way infringe upon the right of the king, Court of King&#x27;s Bench, Court of Common Pleas or other criminal courts to order someone&#x27;s imprisonment. Section 9 provided that the rejection of letters patent and licenses did not extend to corporations over towns, such as the City of London Corporation.

==Dating of the Statute of Monopolies==
The Statute of Monopolies is properly cited without a year. However, when it is cited with a year there are writers who use 1623 and some who use 1624. The confusion arises because the parliamentary session in which it passed assembled on 12 February 1624 (using modern dating), but at the time this would have been 12 February 1623 (as the New Year in England at the time was on Lady Day, 25 March). The act received royal assent on 29 May 1624. At the time all acts passed within a session commenced on the first day of the session. So legally the act was commenced in February 1623, but in terms of historical dating it was commenced and was passed in 1624.

==Significance==
The statute is worded &quot;strongly and broadly&quot;, and other than the exceptions mainly repeated the existing common law. The statute has long been considered a key moment in patent law; Chris Dent, writing in the &quot;Melbourne University Law Review&quot;, identifies it as &quot;a significant marker in the history of patents&quot; with continuing importance, although it is neither the start nor end of patent law. Despite the statute, the courts did not develop a comprehensive and coherent legal doctrine for patent law for more than a century after the statute came into force. Not only is it highly important within patent law, it also played a large role in economics; G. A. Bloxam, writing in the &quot;Journal of Industrial Economics&quot;, identifies the passage of the Statute of Monopolies as &quot;one of the landmarks in the transition of [England&#x27;s] economy from the feudal to the capitalist&quot;.

As well as being significant in relation to patent law, Whig historians have also identified it as the first infringement upon the monarch&#x27;s Royal Prerogative, and one of the first occasions in which the self-confident House of Commons overruled the king, eventually leading to the English Civil War. Chris R. Kyle, writing in the &quot;Journal of Legal History&quot;, notes that this is not the case; not only did the Statute of Monopolies only restate the previous common law, leading to no infringement upon the Royal Prerogative, James I was in the later stages of the bill supportive of its principles. James I was not opposed to the motion; during the 1621 session of Parliament, he voided several monopolies (included those for silver thread and inns), and both James and the Privy Council were active during the passage of the bill to ensure it was supported. Furthermore, the Prince, later Charles I offered amendments in the House of Lords to support its passage.

The statute required extensive judicial action to make it work, particularly on the interpretation of Section 6. Sir Edward Coke, in his &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;, wrote that The subject was also discussed in &quot;Bircot&#x27;s Case&quot;, where it was decided that an inventive improvement to an existing industry or invention was not a new &quot;material&quot;, and could not be patented; such an improvement was described as &quot;to put but a new button to an old coat&quot;. &quot;Hasting&#x27;s Case&quot; confirmed that a patent would not be issued, even for a new &quot;material&quot;, that was extremely close to an old one, something originally laid down in &quot;Matthey&#x27;s Case&quot;. The statute did not stop the monarch issuing such patents in return for money; after James I&#x27;s death, Charles I continued issuing them and avoided having to obey the law by having any cases heard in the conciliar courts, such as the Star Chamber. In response to this abuse and others, the Star Chamber was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640. After the English Restoration, these activities largely ceased because of the dominant power of Parliament and the Bill of Rights 1689, which completely abolished the king&#x27;s ability to disobey or alter statute.

The Statute of Monopolies dominated patent law for centuries; it was received into the laws of many common law jurisdictions and still forms the basis for the modern patent laws of those countries: for example, the patent law of Australia is dominated by the Patents Act 1990, which states that one test for if something is patentable is if it relates to &quot;a manner of manufacture within the meaning of section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies&quot;.

In England and Wales, some sections of the statute are still technically in force, although the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act 1883 (46 &amp; 47 Vict. c. 57), Statute Law Revision Act 1948, Administration of Justice Act 1965 and Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969 repealed most of the legislation. In practice however, with the Patents Act 1977 (which brought the United Kingdom into line with the European Patent Convention), the statute has been implicitly repealed within England and Wales.

<doc id="890589" wikidata="Q450612" url="?curid=890589" title="Elephantis">
<text>Elephantis () (fl. late 1st century BC) was a Greek poet and physician renowned in the classical world as the author of a notorious sex manual. Due to the popularity of courtesans taking animal names in classical times, it is likely Elephantis is two or more persons of the same name. None of her works have survived, though they are referenced in other ancient texts.

==Works==
According to Suetonius in &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, the Roman Emperor Tiberius took a complete set of her works with him when he retreated to his resort on Capri.

One of the poems in the &quot;Priapeia&quot; refers to her books:

(&quot;Lalage dedicates a votive offering to the God of the erect penis, bringing shameless pictures from the books of Elephantis, and begs him to try and imitate with her the variety of intercourse of the figures in the illustrations.&quot;)

And an epigram by the Roman poet Martial, which Smithers and Burton included in their collection of poems concerning Priapus, reads:

(&quot;Such verses as neither the daughters of Didymus know, nor the debauched books of Elephantis, in which are set out new forms of lovemaking.&quot;) &quot;&quot;Novae figurae&quot; has been read as &quot;novem figurae&quot;&quot; (i.e., &quot;nine forms&quot; of lovemaking, rather than &quot;new forms&quot; of lovemaking), and so some commentators have inferred that she listed nine different sexual positions.

Pliny the Elder references her performance as a midwife, and Galen notes her ability to cure baldness.

She also wrote a manual about cosmetics and another about abortives.

<doc id="890593" wikidata="Q6650924" url="?curid=890593" title="Little Miami Railroad">
<text>The Little Miami Railroad was a railway of southwestern Ohio, running from the eastern side of Cincinnati to Springfield, Ohio. By merging with the Columbus and Xenia Railroad in 1853, it created the first through-rail route from the important manufacturing city of Cincinnati to the state capital, Columbus. In this period, railroads were important for creating connections between the important waterways of the Great Lakes and the Ohio River, which were major transportation routes for products to other markets.

The LMRR&#x27;s importance declined later in the 19th century, after three major railroads from the East built lines across the Allegheny Mountains and established east–west transportation systems through the state. It continued independent operations until 1981, after being absorbed by Conrail during the period of extensive railroad restructuring in the late 20th century.

== History==

The Little Miami was incorporated on March 11, 1836. Its first president, who served without pay, was Jeremiah Morrow, governor of Ohio. It was the second railroad incorporated in the state of Ohio. The first meeting to sell stock was held at Linton&#x27;s Hotel, Waynesville, May 13, 1836; the second on June 2, 1836 in Xenia. The railroad was originally intended to run from Cincinnati to Springfield, where it was expected to meet the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, which was building south to Springfield from Sandusky on Lake Erie.

At the time of incorporation, the federal National Road had not yet reached Columbus. Other than trails, the main shipping route for the Great Lakes region to the rest of the nation to the east of the Allegheny Mountains suitable for trade was via the rivers leading to the Great Lakes and from there, to points east along the Erie Canal and south on the Hudson River to the major port of New York City. Winter rendered transportation over the Alleghenies impracticable for large shipments, and the Erie Canal was subject to freezing. The only alternative winter shipping route to points east was a lengthy circuitous southern route by riverboat down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans for transhipment east. The entire regions adjacent to the Great Lakes lacked waterway access to the Ohio River for shipment of their products. Ohio had a rather extensive network of canals under construction by this time, to provide such access, but their waters also froze in winter.

The Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad was projected to run from Sandusky on Lake Erie south to a proposed interchange at Springfield, where trains could be shifted to the Little Miami to proceed to Cincinnati. This would provide the Great Lakes region and its products with year-round access to the rest of the nation, as access to any of the ships then sailing on the Great Lakes meant access to the proposed railroad link to the Ohio River. The proposal that the two railroads would closely cooperate was projected to result in one of the major trade routes of the era, and of particular importance during winter months.

=== Cincinnati to Milford and Loveland constructed ===
On December 14, 1841, the first train ran from Cincinnati to Milford, a distance of along the Little Miami River, and preparations had been made to lay rails north along the river to Fosters. Additional track was opened to Loveland the next year.

=== Opened to Waynesville ===

The road&#x27;s surveyors ran a route along the Little Miami River past Kings Mills to South Lebanon, up Turtle Creek to Lebanon, Ohio, and thence to Waynesville. However, at a grade of to the mile, it was too steep for current locomotives. The city of Lebanon pleaded for the company to reconsider, but the route was instead laid along the river to what would become the towns of Morrow, Fort Ancient (where the gorge is deep and where the Jeremiah Morrow Bridge today stands), Mathers Mills, Oregonia, and to Waynesville (which was on the opposite shore). This country is still sparsely populated. Had the directors waited a few years, more powerful locomotives that could climb the grades would have been available.

=== Opened to Xenia ===

The road was pushed northward and the line to Xenia, the seat of Greene County, opened in August 1845.

=== Completion to Springfield ===
The road was completed to Springfield and inaugurated on August 10, 1846, bringing the total route-miles of its main line to . This resulted in Springfield having railway service before the state capital Columbus. By this time, the National Road had also reached Springfield. The Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad had encountered difficulties in raising capital, and construction was delayed for three years in reaching Springfield. This postponed the completion of the link between the Great Lakes area and the Ohio River. The railroad&#x27;s terminus at Springfield was of little importance prior to completion of the second railroad.

The company found favorable conditions to build a line to Columbus diverging from the Little Miami mainline at Xenia, and its management worked to organize the Columbus and Xenia Railroad. From Xenia, a connection was built to link to the Columbus and Xenia Railroad, its partner. The two companies combined their operations, but did not formally merge, on November 30, 1853. By 1856, the Little Miami had of track, and the C&amp;X had . The two lines formed the only rail link between Cincinnati and the state capital at the time.

=== 1850s upgrades and shift in transportation patterns ===

Revenues from local agricultural shipments were promising enough to enable the line to upgrade to heavier rails and make other improvements during the 1850s. By this time, the line gained the reputation for being one of the best-run lines in the nation. But by 1853, the first of the three railway systems from the Eastern Seaboard that would be built across the Alleghenies and reach Ohio had linked up with the growing railway network in place in Ohio. It became possible to travel from western Ohio to points in the East. Ultimately the New York Central Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad all reached Ohio from the East.

The Hillsboro and Cincinnati Railroad was chartered in 1846 to run a line between Hillsboro and O&#x27;Bannon Creek in Loveland on the Little Miami&#x27;s route. By 1850, the H&amp;C had completed the to Hillsboro. The H&amp;C would lease its line in perpetuity to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad; this ultimately became the mainline of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the area. The new construction upended the established trade routes in Ohio, which had been along a north–south axis to get goods or passengers either to Lake Erie or the Ohio River. The Lake Erie and Mad River Railroad had reached Springfield in 1849, but within a few years, as trans-Allegheny railroads reached into Ohio, they supplanted that line in importance. The most important traffic pattern shifted irrevocably to an east–west-oriented axis. The mainline of the Little Miami Railroad beyond Xenia to Springfield declined in importance to a branch. The Little Miami maintained its Columbus route, but looked to the West when projecting for the future.

=== Growth through mergers ===
 The Little Miami Railroad leased in perpetuity all assets of the C&amp;X on March 18, 1869, while the C&amp;X continued to exist as a separate corporation. At that time, the LMRR had of track and the C&amp;X . It would later acquire of Dayton and Western Railroad track by lease in 1864 and from the Dayton and Xenia Railroad.

The Little Miami joined the Cincinnati and Indiana Railroad in 1862 in building track along the riverfront in Cincinnati to link their two depots. The LMRR and the C&amp;X together bought the Dayton, Xenia and Belpre Railroad in January 1865.

=== Absorbed into the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis RR ===
On February 23, 1870, the Little Miami Railroad leased in perpetuity, renewable forever, all of its assets, including the DX&amp;B, the D&amp;W, and the C&amp;X, to the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway, retroactive to December 1, 1869. The rent was $480,000 per year. The PC&amp;St.L was part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Pennsy co-signed the lease, guaranteeing the payments and other conditions. At the time of the lease, the LMRR system consisted of of track. The system had cost $3,995,165 in track, right-of-way, and facilities, plus $1,065,968 in rolling stock, machinery, and a boat on the Ohio River. On August 28, 1890, the PC&amp;St.L. merged with several other railroads to emerge as the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway.

On the Little Miami River between Kings Mills, Ohio and South Lebanon was Middletown Junction. Here the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad track met the LMRR.

The Lake Erie and Mad River Railroad, initially considered a company for a close relationship with the Little Miami, was absorbed into the competing New York Central system. The Little Miami&#x27;s most serious competitor, the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (1895–1917), became part of the competitive Baltimore and Ohio system.

===From PRR to Conrail===
The LMRR continued to exist as a separate corporation although much of the stock was owned by the Pennsy. In the mid-20th century, there was extensive railroad restructuring following changes in the industry, which had been affected by the expansion of trucking and use of passenger automobiles following construction of the interstate highway system. When the Pennsy&#x27;s successor, the Penn Central company, collapsed into bankruptcy in 1970, the LMRR was still active. It was absorbed by Conrail and merged out of existence December 23, 1981.

===Conversion to rail trail===
Together with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), the local governments of Xenia and Yellow Springs purchased parts of the abandoned right of way from 1973 to 1983. In 1979, during negotiations to purchase the right of way from Terrace Park to Spring Valley for a rail trail and possible heritage railroad, the ODNR allowed Penn Central to salvage much of the abandoned rails and ties. The Little Miami Scenic Trail was built along the former LMRR in stages beginning in 1983, with the final portion opening in 2006.

<text>Jack Pumpkinhead is a fictional character from the Land of Oz who appears in several of the classic children&#x27;s series of Oz books by American author L. Frank Baum. Jack first appeared as a main character in the second Oz book by Baum, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), and returned often in subsequent books. He got the starring role in Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s 1929 book &quot;Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz&quot;.

==The classic Oz books==
Jack&#x27;s incredibly tall and skinny figure is made from tree limbs and jointed with wooden pegs. He has a large carved jack-o&#x27;-lantern for a head, which is where he gets his name (unlike most jack-o&#x27;-lanterns, the pumpkin seeds and other pumpkin guts were not removed so it substitutes for his brain).

Jack was made by a little boy named Tip to scare his guardian, an old witch named Mombi. From Mombi&#x27;s chest he took some old clothes for Jack; purple trousers, a red shirt, a pink vest with white polka dots, and stockings, to which he added a pair of his shoes. When Mombi saw Jack, she almost smashed him to pieces. Instead, she decided to test her new Powder of Life on him. The powder worked and Jack came to life.

Jack is not known for his intelligence which seems to depend on the quality and number of the seeds in his pumpkin-head at that time. However he manages to come up with random bits of wisdom and common sense often. For example, after bringing Jack to life, Mombi has the following exchange with him:

:&quot;Even Mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had brought to life; for, after staring at him intently, she presently asked:&quot;

:&quot;What do you know?&quot;

:&quot;&quot;Well, that is hard to tell,&quot; replied Jack. &quot;For although I feel that I know a tremendous lot, I am not yet aware how much there is in the world to find out about. It will take me a little time to discover whether I am very wise or very foolish.&quot;&quot;

Although Jack Pumpkinhead would not get tired from walking, his joints would still wear out. To remedy this, Tip created the Sawhorse to serve as Jack&#x27;s mode of transportation. By the end of the second Oz book, Tip, who was originally born Ozma, is changed back into a female by the same magic that made him male. Jack notes that he no longer has a father.

In the fifth Oz book &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909), Jack has settled in a large pumpkin-shaped house near the Tin Woodman&#x27;s castle in Winkie Country. Jack spends much of his time growing pumpkins to replace his old heads, which eventually spoil and need to be replaced. Princess Ozma, now recognized as his mother, carves new heads for Jack when necessary. The old heads are buried in a graveyard on his property. In the sixth Oz book &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910), it is revealed that Jack designed a five-storey, jewel-encrusted, corn-shaped mansion for the Scarecrow to live in.

==In Thompson and Neill==
In the continued series after Baum&#x27;s death in 1919, Jack Pumpkinhead had to wait until the 23rd Oz book to get a book named after himself along with the starring role. &quot;Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz&quot; was written by Ruth Plumly Thompson, the writer who continued the Oz books after the death of L. Frank Baum. In the book, Peter (the little-boy baseball pitcher from Philadelphia), while reminiscing about his previous visit to Oz, suddenly finds himself landing right into Jack Pumpkinhead&#x27;s front yard in the Winkie Country. Peter and Jack set off together for the Emerald City, but take a wrong turn, ending up traveling through the Quadling Country.

At one point in the book, Peter combats darkness by lighting a candle and placing it in Jack&#x27;s empty head. Jack notes that it makes him feel &quot;brighter,&quot; but also &quot;A little light headed.&quot;

John R. Neill includes Jack in his final Oz book, &quot;The Runaway in Oz&quot;. In both the Thompson and Neill books, Jack loses his head for varying periods of time; In Neill, his headless stick body is dragged about the countryside of Oz by his companions.

==In comics==
Jack Pumpkinhead was one of the Freedom Fighters in the 1995 comic book &quot;Oz,&quot; created by Ralph Griffth, Stuart Kerr, and Bill Bryan, and published by Caliber Comics. Jack was killed during the company-wide crossover, &quot;Daemonstorm,&quot; after having been possessed by one of the demons.

Jack also appears in the comic book &quot;The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles,&quot; created by Ben Avery and Casey Heying, which is published twice a year by Buy Me Toys.

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series, Mervyn Pumpkinhead, who is clearly modeled on Jack, works for Morpheus in the Dreaming, where he paints and builds dreams.

In issue 101 of &quot;Fables&quot;, Bufkin the winged monkey finds his way back to Oz&#x27;s neighboring country Ev. He runs across Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and Bungle. Upon hearing of their resistance to the Nome King, Bufkin pledges to lead them in the revolution. This is an allusion to the Baum novel &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; and/or the comics series &quot;Oz&quot; mentioned above.

==Portrayals==
Jack Pumpkinhead was first portrayed on stage by Hal Godfrey in the 1905 stage play, &quot;The Woggle-Bug&quot; by Baum and Frederic Chapin. The play failed in Chicago and was never revived or recast. Bronson Ward, Jr. played the role in the 1908 film, &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot;. Although photographs suggest something more realistic than the makeup worn by Godfrey was used for the film, the popular character makes no appearances in the productions of The Oz Film Manufacturing Company.

George Wadsworth plays &quot;Jack the Pumpkinhead&quot; in Barry Mahon&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Land of Oz&quot; (1969).

Without a first name, Jack appears, voiced by Paul Lynde, in the animated movie sequel &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; (which had a different outcome for the character).

Robert Ridgely voices Jack Pumpkinhead in the 1980 TV special &quot;Thanksgiving in the Land of Oz&quot;.

Stewart Larange, an exceptionally thin actor, portrayed Jack in the live-action movie &quot;Return to Oz&quot; (1985) while Brian Henson was the animatronic puppeteer and provided his voice.

Ross Maplettoft who played Jack Pumpkinhead Sr. in the animated TV series &quot;The Oz Kids&quot; (1996-1997) He has a son named Jack Pumpkinhead Jr. His son likes to adventure with his friends.

Viktor Sukhorukov provided the voice of Jack Pumpkinhead in the 2000 Russian adaptation of &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, &quot;Adventures in the Emerald City: Princess Ozma&quot;.

Gerran Howell portrayed Jack in the NBC series &quot;Emerald City&quot;.

Jack Pumpkinhead appears in the animated series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; voiced by JP Karliak. First appearing in &quot;Halloween Heist,&quot; Jack was created by Wilhelmina using the Potion of Life on a jack-o&#x27;-lantern to give Dorothy and her friends a scare on Halloween. However, he is too simple-minded and friendly to be scary.

<doc id="890606" wikidata="Q154498" url="?curid=890606" title="Sachsenhausen concentration camp">
<text>Sachsenhausen () or Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg was a German Nazi concentration camp in Oranienburg, Germany, used from 1936 until April 1945, shortly before the defeat of Nazi Germany in May later that year. It mainly held political prisoners throughout World War II. Prominent prisoners included Joseph Stalin&#x27;s oldest son, Yakov Dzhugashvili; assassin Herschel Grynszpan; Paul Reynaud, the penultimate prime minister of the French Third Republic; Francisco Largo Caballero, prime minister of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War; the wife and children of the crown prince of Bavaria; Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera; and several enemy soldiers and political dissidents.

Sachsenhausen was a labour camp, outfitted with several subcamps, a gas chamber, and a medical experimentation area. Prisoners were treated inhumanely, fed inadequately, and killed openly. After World War II, when Oranienburg was in the Soviet Occupation Zone, the structure was used by the NKVD as NKVD special camp Nr. 7. Today, Sachsenhausen is open to the public as a memorial.

==Sachsenhausen under Nazi Germany==
The camp was established in 1936. It was located north of Berlin, which gave it a primary position among the German concentration camps: the administrative centre of all concentration camps was located in Oranienburg, and Sachsenhausen became a training centre for &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) officers (who would often be sent to oversee other camps afterwards). Initially, the camp was used to perfect the most efficient and effective execution method for use in the death camps. Given that, executions obviously took place at Sachsenhausen, especially of Soviet prisoners of war.

During the earlier stages of the camp&#x27;s existence, the executions were done by placing the prisoners in a small room, often even with music playing, called the &quot;Genickschussbaracke&quot; &quot;()&quot; and told they were to have their height and weight measured but were instead shot in the back of the neck through a sliding door located behind the neck. This was found to be far too time-consuming, so they then trialled a trench, killing either by shooting or by hanging. While this more easily enabled group executions, it created too much initial panic among the prisoners, making them harder to control. Then small scale trials of what would go on to become the large scale, death camp gas chambers were designed and carried out. These trials showed the authorities that this method facilitated the means to murder the largest number of prisoners without &quot;excessive&quot; initial panic. So by September 1941, when they were conducting the first trials of this method at Auschwitz, Sachsenhausen had already been the scene of &quot;some gassings in conjunction with the development of gas vans&quot;.

The prisoners were also used as a workforce, with a large task force of prisoners from the camp sent to work in the nearby brickworks to meet Albert Speer&#x27;s vision of rebuilding Berlin.
==Camp layout==
In July 1936, the Esterwegen concentration camp and Columbia concentration camp were closed and those prisoners moved to the Oranienburg concentration camp. That summer, those prisoners began clearing an of triangular forested area. By 1937, the prisoners had erected prisoners&#x27; barracks and SS guards&#x27; quarters, and SS officers&#x27; families housing. The &quot;protective custody&quot; internment camp was laid out in an isosceles triangle with sides long. Tower A was at its central control point, linked to the SS troop camp outside along the central axis. The entire camp could be viewed by the SS command staff from Tower A. Initially in area, the camp eventually grew to cover . Designed by Bernhard Kuiper, Himmler called Sachsenhausen a &quot;completely new concentration camp for the modern age, which can be extended at any time.&quot; In practice, however, extending the design proved impractical.

There was an infirmary inside the southern angle of the perimeter and a camp prison within the eastern angle. There was also a camp kitchen and a camp laundry. The camp&#x27;s capacity became inadequate and the camp was expanded in 1938 by a new rectangular area (the &quot;small camp&quot;) northeast of the entrance gate and the perimeter wall was altered to enclose it. There was an additional area (&quot;Sonderlager&quot;) outside the main camp perimeter to the north; this consisted of two huts Sonderlager &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; built in 1941 for special prisoners that the regime wished to isolate.

==Neutral zone==

The neutral zone was located between the camp wall and the prisoners&#x27; camp. Between the zone and the wall was a trip wire, , barbed-wire obstacles, an electrified barbed-wire fence, and a sentry path.

==Slave labour==

Sachsenhausen was the site of Operation Bernhard, one of the largest currency counterfeiting operations ever recorded. The Germans forced inmate artisans to produce forged American and British currency, as part of a plan to undermine the British and American economies, courtesy of &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) chief Reinhard Heydrich. The Germans introduced fake British £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes into circulation in 1943: the Bank of England never found them. Plans had been made to drop British pounds over London by plane. Today, these notes are considered very valuable by collectors.

An industrial area, outside the western camp perimeter, contained SS workshops in which prisoners were forced to work; those unable to work had to stand at attention for the duration of the working day. Heinkel, the aircraft manufacturer, was a major user of Sachsenhausen labour, using between 6,000 and 8,000 prisoners on their He 177 bomber. Although official German reports claimed the prisoners were &quot;working without fault&quot;, some of these aircraft crashed unexpectedly around Stalingrad and it is suspected that prisoners had sabotaged them. Other firms included AEG and Siemens. Prisoners also worked in a brick factory.

==Prisoner abuses==

Overall, at least 30,000 inmates died in Sachsenhausen from causes such as exhaustion, disease, malnutrition and pneumonia, as a result of the poor living conditions. Many were executed or died as the result of brutal medical experimentation.

In 1937, the SS constructed a Cell Block for the punishment, interrogation, and torture of prisoners. Important people confined there included Martin Niemöller and Georg Elser.

From 1939 until 1943, over 600 homosexual prisoners were killed.

In November 1940, the SS executed 33 Polish prisoners by firing squad. In April 1941, over 550 prisoners were killed under Action 14f13. In the autumn of 1941, over 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war were shot.

In May 1942, the first hangings commenced from gallows in the roll-call area. These continued until 1945.

In May 1942, 71 Dutch resistance fighters and 250 Jewish hostages were executed.

In May 1942, &quot;Station Z&quot; was completed in an industrial yard outside the camp walls. It included prisoner killing rooms, four crematoria, and a gas chamber after 1943. In 1941, an adjacent sand pit was enlarged and made into an &quot;execution trench&quot;.

Camp punishments could be harsh. Some would be required to assume the &quot;Sachsenhausen salute&quot; where a prisoner would squat with his arms outstretched in front. There was a marching strip around the perimeter of the roll call ground, where prisoners had to march over a variety of surfaces, to test military footwear; between were covered each day. Prisoners assigned to the camp prison would be kept in isolation on poor rations and some would be suspended from posts by their wrists tied behind their backs (strappado). In cases such as attempted escape, there would be a public hanging in front of the assembled prisoners.
Prisoners of war were made to run up to a day with heavy packs, sometimes after being given performance-boosting drugs like cocaine, to trial military boots in tests commissioned by shoe factories.

 did experiments using the lethal sulfur mustard gas.
There have also been allegations of an experimental drug tested upon unwilling inmates in 1944 designated &quot;D-IX&quot; at the Sachsenhausen facility. Designed to increase stamina and endurance, this drug, supposedly consisting of a cocktail of cocaine, methamphetamine (Pervitin), and oxycodone (Eukodal), was designed to see use from members of the Wehrmacht, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe to enhance mission performance where endurance and exhaustion become pertinent issues. While these drugs were used in their individual forms by all branches of the German military, the nature and use there of D-IX specifically (especially experimentation upon Sachsenhausen prisoners) lacks enough substantiation to be considered credible, though experiments by the Nazis upon unwilling prisoners utilizing psychoactive compounds is far from myth, and could hardly be ruled outside the realm of plausibility.

==Prisoners held or executed at Sachsenhausen==

Seven men of the British Army&#x27;s No. 2 Commando, captured after the highly successful Operation Musketoon, were executed at Sachsenhausen. They were shot on 23 October 1942, five days after Adolf Hitler issued his Commando Order calling for the killing of all captured members of commando units.

Four SOE agents led by Lt Cdr Mike Cumberlege RNR, who took part in the 1943 Operation Locksmith in Greece intended to blow up the Corinth Canal and were captured in May 1943, were held in Sachsenhausen&#x27;s Zellenbau isolation cells for more than a year before being executed in February/March 1945.

Survivors of Operation Checkmate, a 1942 commando anti-shipping operation in Norway, including their leader, John Godwin, RN, were held at Sachsenhausen until February 1945, when they were executed. Godwin managed to wrestle the pistol of the firing party commander from his belt and shot him dead before being himself shot.

The Zellenbau of about 80 cells held some of World War II&#x27;s most persistent Allied escapees as well as German dissidents, Nazi deserters and nationalists from East Europe such as the Ukrainian leader Taras Bulba-Borovets whom the Nazis hoped to persuade to change sides and fight the Soviets.

Over the course of its operation, over 100 Dutch resistance fighters were executed at Sachsenhausen. Dutch Freemasons were also sent to the camp including the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, , who died there in March 1941, after being arrested by Klaus Barbie.

==Aftermath==

At the end of 1944, Himmler ordered the execution of every prisoner. Sick inmates were executed in the industrial yard, including at least 2,000, or transferred to death camps. In February 1945, more than 1,300 prisoners were executed during the evacuation of the Lieberose forced labor camp, a subsidiary of Sachsenhausen. With the advance of the Red Army in the spring of 1945, Sachsenhausen was prepared for evacuation. On 21 April, the camp&#x27;s SS staff ordered 33,000 inmates on a forced march northwest. Most of the prisoners were physically exhausted and thousands did not survive this death march; those who collapsed &quot;en route&quot; were shot by the SS. The march ended near Raben Steinfeld in early May, after liberation by the Red Army and US Army. On 22 April 1945, the camp&#x27;s remaining 3,400 inmates were liberated by the 1st Belorussian Front and the Polish 2nd Infantry Division.

According to an article published on 13 December 2001 in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;In the early years of the war the SS practiced methods of mass killing there that were later used in the Nazi death camps. Of the roughly 30,000 wartime victims at Sachsenhausen, most were Soviet prisoners of war&quot;.

== NKVD special camp Nr. 7 / Soviet Special Camp Nr. 1 (1945–1950) ==
After the last of the liberated concentration camp prisoners had left the site in the summer of 1945, the camp was used as a special camp by the Soviet military administration from August 1945 until 1950. Nazi functionaries were held in the camp, as were political prisoners and inmates sentenced by Soviet Military Tribunals.

In the beginning, 150 prisoners from NKVD special camp Nr. 7 Weesow near Werneuchen arrived in Sachsenhausen. Apart from the crematorium and the extermination facility, almost all buildings from the former concentration camp were used again (especially the wooden barracks, the camp prison and the utility buildings). Towards the end of 1945, the camp was again fully occupied (12,000 people). In the following year, up to 16,000 people were imprisoned in the camp at times. About 2,000 female prisoners lived in a separate area of the camp.

By 1948, Sachsenhausen, now renamed &quot;Special Camp No. 1&quot;, was the largest of three special camps in the Soviet Occupation Zone. The 60,000 people interned over five years included 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied camps. Others were Nazi functionaries, anti-Communists and Russians, including Nazi collaborators. By the time the camp was closed in the spring of 1950, at least 12,000 had died of malnutrition and disease.

In spring 1950, a few months after the founding of the GDR, the last Soviet camps were dissolved. About 8,000 prisoners were released from Special Camp No. 1, and a smaller group was transported to the Soviet Union. The NKVD transferred 5,500 prisoners to the GDR authorities. Among them were 1,119 women and about 30 children born in the camp (so-called &quot;Landeskinder&quot;) were transferred to the GDR women&#x27;s prison at Hoheneck/Stollberg. The injustice of the continued use of the National Socialist concentration camps by the Soviet occupying power and the renewed agonising deaths of thousands of people associated with it were concealed or played down by the SED regime. During the Waldheim trials, some survivors of the Soviet camp in Sachsenhausen were sentenced to imprisonment in Bautzen or Waldheim.

==Camp staff==
===Commanders===
* Michael Lippert, July 1936 – October 1936
* Karl-Otto Koch, October 1936 – July 1937
* Hans Helwig, July 1937 – January 1938
* Hermann Baranowski, February 1938 – September 1939
* Walter Eisfeld, 1939–1940
* Hans Loritz, 1940–1942
* Albert Sauer, 1942–1943
* Anton Kaindl, 1943–1945

===Guards===
Many women were among the inmates of Sachsenhausen and its subcamps. According to SS files, more than 2,000 women lived in Sachsenhausen, guarded by female SS staff (&quot;Aufseherin&quot;). Camp records show that there was one male SS soldier for every ten inmates and for every ten male SS there was a woman SS. Several subcamps for women were established in Berlin, including in Neukölln.

Sachsenhausen female guards included Ilse Koch, and later Hilde Schlusser. Anna Klein is also known to have worked at the camp.

==War crimes trials==
Fourteen of the concentration camp&#x27;s officials, including former commandant Anton Kaindl and the camp doctor Heinz Baumkötter, as well as two Kapos, were brought to trial on 23 October 1947 before a Soviet Military Tribunal in Berlin. On 1 November 1947, all sixteen of them were found guilty. Fourteen defendants were given life sentences with hard labor, including Kaindl and Baumkötter, and two others were sentenced to fifteen years in prison with hard labor. They served their time under harsh conditions in Siberian labor camps. Six of them, including Kaindl, died in custody within a few months. In 1956, those who were still alive were released and sent back to Germany.

The Dutch sought the extradition from Czechoslovakia of Antonín Zápotocký, who became President of Czechoslovakia, for his alleged role in the murder of Dutch prisoners during his time as a &quot;kapo&quot; at the camp.

In the GDR, various subsequent trials took place against members of the SS guards of Sachsenhausen concentration camp, such as Roland Puhr and Arnold Zöllner. Puhr was executed in 1964, while Zöllner was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Rostock District Court in 1966.

In the Federal Republic of Germany, there were also various follow-up trials against guards members, such as the Sachsenhausen trials in Cologne in the 1960s. In 1960, a trial against SS-Hauptscharführer and Blockführer Richard Bugdalle for the murder of concentration camp inmates took place before the Munich II Regional Court. In March 2009 Josias Kumpf, 83 was deported from Wisconsin back to Austria after having been found to have been a SS Guard at KZ Sachsenhausen and Trawniki. In May 2022, a trial began in Germany against a SS guard at KZ Sachsenhausen of SS-Rottenführer Josef Schütz age 101. The next month, Schütz would be convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, becoming the oldest surviving Nazi fugitive to be convicted. 

In August 2023, charges were brought against a former SS guard who served in Sachsenhausen Guard Battalion, Gregor Formanek. Despite the possibility that Formanek may also be the potentially last former Sachenshausen Nazi officer to stand trial, it was acknowledged that his ability to stand trial was unlikely, due to limited capacity for understanding and will. In June 2024, a German court ruled that Formanek was unfit to stand trial, though an appeal is likely. In spite of the German case against Formanek, it has also been acknowledged that Formanek had previously served 10 years of a 25 year prison sentence in a Soviet prison after being captured by Red Army forces in 1945.

==East Germany==
===East German barracks===
After the Soviets vacated the site, it was used for some years by East Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kasernierte Volkspolizei&quot;, notionally a police division and in reality a precursor of the country&#x27;s own National People&#x27;s Army, which was formally established in 1956.

=== Sachsenhausen National Memorial Site (&quot;Nationale Mahn- u. Gedenkstätte Sachsenhausen&quot;) ===
In 1956, planning began for the adaptation of the concentration camp site as a national memorial. This was inaugurated four years later on 23 April 1961 by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED). The first director of the renamed &quot;Sachsenhausen National Memorial Site&quot; (&quot;Nationale Mahn- u. Gedenkstätte Sachsenhausen&quot;) was Christian Mahler, at one time a senior police officer, who back in the Nazi period had been an inmate at Sachsenhausen between 1938 and 1943. The plans involved the removal of most of the original buildings and the construction of an obelisk, statue and meeting area, reflecting the outlook of the government of East Germany of that time.

Other than the memorial sites in Buchenwald and Ravensbrück, the Sachsenhausen memorial, where the official celebrations of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) were held, was located in the former concentration camp. It was controlled by the Ministry of Culture, and as the National Memorial Sites Buchenwald and Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen served as place of identification and legitimisation of the GDR.

The government of East Germany emphasised the suffering of political prisoners over that of the other groups detained at Sachsenhausen. The memorial obelisk contains eighteen red triangles, the symbol the Nazis gave to political prisoners, usually communists. There is a plaque in Sachsenhausen built in memory of the Death March. This plaque has a picture of malnourished male prisoners marching, all of whom are wearing the red triangle of a political prisoner.

Based on reporting in the newspaper Neues Deutschland, historian Anne-Kathleen Tillack-Graf shows how the Sachsenhausen National Memorial Site was politically instrumentalised in the GDR, especially during the celebrations for the liberation of the concentration camp.

==Unified Germany==
===Museum===
After German reunification, the former camp was entrusted to a foundation that opened a museum on the site. So since 1993, the &quot;Gedenkstätte und Museum Sachsenhausen&quot; (Sachsenhausen Memorial and Museum) has been responsible for exhibitions and research on the camp&#x27;s history on the grounds of the former Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp. The educational work of the institution focuses on the history of the Oranienburg concentration camp, various aspects of the history of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, the Soviet special camp and the history of the memorial itself.

The museum features artwork created by inmates and a high pile of gold teeth (extracted by the Nazis from the prisoners), scale models of the camp, pictures, documents and other artifacts illustrating life in the camp. The administrative buildings from which the entire German concentration camp network was run have been preserved and can also be seen.

, the site of the Sachsenhausen camp, at 22, Strasse der Nationen in Oranienburg, is open to the public as a museum and a memorial. Several buildings and structures survive or have been reconstructed, including guard towers, the camp entrance, crematory ovens and the camp barracks.

===Excavations===
With the fall of communist East Germany, it was possible to conduct excavations in the former camps. At Sachsenhausen, the bodies of 12,500 victims were found; most were children, adolescents and elderly people.

===Soviet-era crimes===
Following the discovery in 1990 of mass graves from the Soviet period, a separate museum was opened documenting the camp&#x27;s Soviet-era history. Between 1945 and 1950, 12,000 people died of hunger and disease in the so-called &quot;Speziallager&quot;.

===Neo-Nazi vandalism===
The compound has been vandalized by neo-Nazis several times. In September 1992, barracks 38 and 39 of the Jewish Museum were severely damaged in an arson attack. The perpetrators were arrested, and the barracks were reconstructed by 1997. However, it is important to note that the decision was taken that no buildings built during the Nazi regime will be rebuilt on the site. The destroyed section of the huts are now a Jewish museum with the surviving section left as it was immediately after the fire with the paint still blistered from the flames.

===Video game scandal===
Sites within Sachsenhausen and Dachau which had been approved for inclusion in the augmented reality smartphone game Ingress were removed in July 2015; Gabriele Hammerman, director of the memorial site at Dachau, told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur that Google&#x27;s actions were a humiliation for victims and relatives of the Nazi camps, and Niantic Labs&#x27; founder John Hanke stated that &quot;we apologize that this has happened.&quot;

<text>Utopia Parkway is the second studio album by the American rock band Fountains of Wayne. It was released by Atlantic Records in April 1999.

==Background==
The album was written by Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger with the intention of emulating albums with a strong thematic story inspired by its surroundings, such as &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; by The Kinks and &quot;Born to Run&quot; by Bruce Springsteen. According to Schlesinger, &quot;When we were teenagers, we liked listening to Kinks records because we&#x27;d never been to England, and we got a sense of what it was like to live there. We really wanted to make a record that felt whole. We intentionally didn&#x27;t include a few good songs because once we started picking up on the thematic connections, we wanted to stick with it.&quot; Collingwood added, &quot;It had to do with reaching a level of maturity where you realize your own life is worth singing about. We spent so much time glamourizing bands like the Kinks, but what they were singing about was just everyday suburbia in England. There&#x27;s this realization that you don&#x27;t have to sing about Kensington for it to be worthwhile.&quot;

In terms of musical direction, the band opted to evoke songs and bands that had an ubiquitous nature when they were younger. According to Schlesinger, &quot;Musically, the stuff on the record is like picking through all the songs that people our age weren&#x27;t about to avoid growing up. It could be Loverboy, Steve Miller, the Cars, Journey. You don&#x27;t even know if you like it or hate it; it just pops into your head. Sometimes when we&#x27;re arranging a song we all remember something at the same time so we&#x27;ll throw it in there. It&#x27;s not even really conscious.&quot;

Collingwood&#x27;s songwriting contributions on this album - including &quot;Troubled Times&quot;, &quot;A Fine Day for a Parade&quot; and &quot;Amity Gardens&quot; - tended to be more serious than Schlesinger&#x27;s. According to Collingwood, &quot;I think I was a little panicky after the first record as being perceived as a novelty band. So I was trying to move away from making jokes on this record. That&#x27;s why my contributions are more dismal.&quot;

This is also the first Fountains of Wayne album to feature guitarist Jody Porter and drummer Brian Young, who joined the band after Collingwood and Schlesinger had finished recording the debut album almost entirely on their own. According to Collingwood, &quot;The new album was definitely recorded more like a band. We had been touring with them for over a year after making the first record, and it felt like second nature when we made the new record and it sounded the way the band sounds. The progression from the first record to the second was so gradual that I didn&#x27;t really notice until I went back and listened to the first album and realized it really didn&#x27;t sound like a band.&quot;

==Cover==
The album is named after a major street that connects the neighborhoods of Utopia and Beechhurst in the Queens borough of New York City, and its street sign is featured on the album cover. According to Schlesinger, &quot;The name is so evocative. It ties in all these different places and characters because there&#x27;s such a sense of longing about it.&quot;

==Details==
Dropped by Atlantic after sales failed to meet expectations, the band had a growing dispute with the company after it put no effort into promoting the album&#x27;s single &quot;Troubled Times&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Utopia Parkway&quot; was named an &quot;Album of the Week&quot; by &quot;People&quot; in 1999 upon its release, but received mixed reviews from music press with some claiming the album showed the band &quot;lacked depth&quot; while others declared it a &quot;masterpiece from the moment you first hear it&quot;.

The album contains two fan favorite songs from the Fountains&#x27; live performances: &quot;Red Dragon Tattoo,&quot; about a boy who gets a tattoo to impress a girl, and &quot;Denise,&quot; a faux-grunge power-pop confection where the songwriters show their intentionally bad and comic writing with &quot;She works at Liberty Travel/ She&#x27;s got a heart made of gravel.&quot; &quot;Troubled Times,&quot; originally written by Collingwood when he and Schlesinger were in a previous incarnation of Fountains of Wayne called Pinnwheel, is also a fan favorite.

&quot;Red Dragon Tattoo&quot; was featured prominently throughout the Stephen King mini-series &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot;. The 2008 Dar Williams album &quot;Promised Land&quot; includes a cover of &quot;Troubled Times&quot;.

<text>Samuel Webb (born June 4, 1945) is an American activist and political leader, who served as the Chairman of the Communist Party USA from 2000 to 2014, succeeding the party&#x27;s longest running leader Gus Hall. Webb did not accept nomination to be reelected as chairman at the 30th National Convention of the Communist Party USA in 2014, at which John Bachtell was elected the party&#x27;s new chairman. Webb continued to serve on the party&#x27;s National Committee until 2016.

==Biography==
Samuel Webb was born in Maine and graduated from St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1967. He holds an M.A. in economics from the University of Connecticut. He worked as a Communist Party organizer in Michigan from 1978–1988.

Webb led the CPUSA when it made the decision to support some Democratic candidates in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. While the Party regarded both major parties as two capitalist entities in a collaborative dictatorship for established financial institutions, it believed that rule by the Democrats was preferable to rule by the Republicans, arguing that the latter puts the interests of working people in considerable danger. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Webb called President Obama a &quot;people&#x27;s advocate&quot; and said that some of his early decisions, in reversing some of President George W. Bush&#x27;s policies, were praiseworthy.

In 2005 Webb wrote &quot;Reflections on Socialism&quot;, a paper reflecting ideas that Webb first presented at the 2005 Left Forum in New York City. This paper points out that socialism is once again being discussed in the trade union and student movements, in popular magazines and certainly in the halls of power worldwide.

Webb traveled to China, United Kingdom, Cuba, and Vietnam, in order to meet communist and socialist leaders.

On February 4, 2011 Webb published an essay in the Communist Party magazine &quot;Political Affairs&quot;, &quot;A Party of Socialism in the 21st Century: What It Looks Like, What It Says, and What It Does&quot;. It set forth positions that came under sharp criticism from Communist parties across the world, as well as a portion of CPUSA members, as being revisionist, social democratic, and anti-Communist. These parties included the Communist Parties of Canada, Mexico, Germany and Greece as well as the CPUSA Houston club, the Austin Hogan Transit Club of NYC, the CPUSA Tucson Club, the LA Metro Club, and the Communist Party of San Francisco.

In 2014, Webb did not seek reelection as the National Committee&#x27;s chairman and stepped down from office. At the 30th National Convention of the Communist Party USA, John Bachtell was elected as the new Chairman of the National Committee, thereby ending Webb&#x27;s 14 years as the party&#x27;s leader.

At the end of the 2016 Democratic primary, Webb defended Hillary Clinton and urged supporters of Bernie Sanders to support her in the general election.

<text>The New River is a tributary of the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Via the Big South Fork and the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

The New River rises on Frozen Head, a notable mountain of Morgan County, Tennessee. Named for its frequent winter appearance, Frozen Head is the focal point of Frozen Head State Park and Natural Area. Draining an area of Pennsylvanian Period rock that has been subjected to extensive strip mining for coal, the upper reaches of the stream have at times been subject to heavy pollution. The stream initially trends northeast. The upper portion of the course is paralleled by State Route 116. It soon crosses into a remote area of Anderson County, and then into Campbell County. At this juncture, State Route 116 turns to the southeast to follow the Ligias Fork, and the road paralleling the New River becomes a small county road. The stream trends generally north from this point for several miles, and is also paralleled by a railroad constructed primarily for the purposes of coal transport.

The stream, road, and railroad cross into Scott County. Several miles into Scott County, the stream begins a westerly trend. It drains an area developed by the petroleum industry as an oil field, and is crossed by U.S. Highway 27 at the community of New River. Just downstream of this community is the boundary of the Big South Fork National Recreational Area. The New River is joined slightly downstream of this point by the Clear Fork, and the stream downstream from this point is known as the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River.

<doc id="890626" wikidata="Q876848" url="?curid=890626" title="The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time">
<text>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a 2003 mystery novel by British writer Mark Haddon. Its title refers to an observation by the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (created by Arthur Conan Doyle) in the 1892 short story &quot;The Adventure of Silver Blaze&quot;. Haddon and &quot;The Curious Incident&quot; won the Whitbread Book Awards for Best Novel and Book of the Year, the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for Best First Book, and the Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize. Unusually, it was published simultaneously in separate editions for adults and children.

The novel is narrated in the first-person by Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old boy who is described as &quot;a mathematician with some behavioural difficulties&quot; living in Swindon, Wiltshire. Although Christopher&#x27;s condition is not stated, the book&#x27;s blurb refers to Asperger syndrome. In July 2009, Haddon wrote on his blog that &quot;&quot;The Curious Incident&quot; is not a book about Asperger&#x27;s... if anything it&#x27;s a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way. The book is not specifically about any specific disorder&quot;, and that he, Haddon, is not an expert on the autism spectrum or Asperger&#x27;s syndrome.

The book uses prime numbers to number the chapters, rather than the conventional successive numbers. Originally written in English, it has been translated into 36 additional languages.

==Plot==
Christopher John Francis Boone is a 15-year-old boy living in Swindon, England, with his widowed father, Ed. Christopher&#x27;s mother, Judy, died from a heart attack two years prior to the events of the story. One night, Christopher discovers that his neighbour Mrs. Shears&#x27;s dog, Wellington, has been fatally speared with a garden fork. As Christopher mourns over Wellington&#x27;s body, Mrs. Shears calls the police. When a policeman grabs Christopher&#x27;s arm, Christopher panics and hits him, so he is arrested for assaulting a police officer, though he is quickly released with a police caution. He decides to investigate the dog&#x27;s death, despite his father&#x27;s objections, chronicling any information he receives in a book. During his investigation, he meets the elderly Mrs. Alexander, who informs Christopher that his mother had an affair with Mr. Shears.

Ed discovers the book and confiscates it. While searching his father&#x27;s room for the book, Christopher finds letters from his mother dated after her supposed death, and eventually realises that she is still alive and living in London with Mr. Shears. He becomes distressed and enters a catatonic state. Realizing that Christopher has discovered the letters, Ed admits to lying about Judy&#x27;s death. Ed also confesses that he had killed Wellington in anger after an argument with Mrs. Shears. Christopher decides to run away and live with his mother.

After a long, event-filled journey, evading policemen and feeling ill from the trains and crowds around him, he finally finds his way to the home of his mother and Mr. Shears, much to the delight of the former and chagrin of the latter. Soon after arriving, Christopher wants to return to Swindon in order to take his mathematics A-level, but his mother contacts the school to postpone it. However, Judy and Mr. Shears break up due to conflict over Christopher, and as a result Judy returns with Christopher to Swindon and the exam is reinstated.

After an argument, Judy agrees to let Ed see Christopher for brief daily visits. Christopher remains apprehensive of his father, hoping he will be imprisoned for killing Wellington. Ed gifts Christopher a puppy, promising that he will gradually rebuild trust with his son. Christopher declares that he will take further exams and attend university. He completes his mathematics A-level with top grades. The book ends with Christopher optimistic about his future.

== Themes ==

=== Social disability ===
In a 2004 interview, Haddon said I have to say honestly that I did more research about the London Underground and the inside of Swindon Railway Station, where some of the novel takes place, than I did about Asperger&#x27;s syndrome. I gave [Christopher] kind of 9 or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn&#x27;t read any more about Asperger&#x27;s because I think there is no typical person who has Asperger&#x27;s syndrome, and they&#x27;re as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society. And the important thing is that I did a lot of imagining, that I did a lot of putting myself into his shoes in trying to make him come alive as a human being rather than getting him right, whatever that might mean.

Haddon states on his website that, although he had read &quot;a handful of newspaper and magazine articles about, or by, people with Asperger&#x27;s and autism&quot; in preparation for writing the book, he knows &quot;very little&quot; about Asperger&#x27;s syndrome and that Christopher Boone is inspired by two different people. According to Haddon, neither of these people can be labelled as having a disability. Haddon added that he &quot;slightly regret[s]&quot; that the term &quot;Asperger&#x27;s syndrome&quot; appeared on the cover of his novel. In 2010, in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, he was described as now thoroughly irritated that the word Asperger&#x27;s appeared on subsequent editions of the novel, because now everyone imagines that he is an expert and he keeps getting phone calls asking him to appear at lectures.

In a critical essay on the novel, Vivienne Muller quotes some praise by experts on disability theory: In its presentation of Christopher&#x27;s everyday experiences of the society in which he lives, the narrative offers a rich canvas of experiences for an ethnographic study of this particular cognitive condition, and one which places a positive spin on the syndrome. The reader in this instance acts as ethnographer, invited to see what Mark Osteen claims is a &#x27;quality in autistic lives that is valuable in and of itself&#x27;. Along similar lines, [Alex] McClimens writes that Haddon&#x27;s novel is &#x27;an ethnographic delight&#x27; and that &#x27;Haddon&#x27;s achievement is to have written a novel that turns on the central character&#x27;s difference without making that difference a stigmatising characteristic. Muller adds that the novel works with a strong sense of the disabled speaking subject, drawing readers into Christopher&#x27;s cognitive / corporeal space through an incremental layering of his perspectives and reactions... The narrative also bristles with diagrams, maps, drawings, stories, texts that inform Christopher&#x27;s lexicon for mapping meaning in a world of bewildering signs and sounds. She also admires such elements as the digressive stream-of-connectedness-and-disconnectedness way in which Christopher writes and thinks; the obsessive focus on minutiae; his musings about why animals behave the way they do; his quasi-philosophizing on death and life and the afterlife; his ambition to be an astronaut ...

In a survey of children&#x27;s books which &quot;teach about emotional life&quot;, Laura Jana wrote: On the one hand, this is a story of how an undeniably quirky teenage boy clings to order, deals with a family crisis, and tries to make sense of the world as he sees it. But it also provides profound insight into a disorder – autism – that leaves those who have it struggling to perceive even the most basic of human emotions. In so doing, &quot;The Curious Incident&quot; leaves its readers with a greater appreciation of their own ability to feel, express, and interpret emotions. This mainstream literary success made its way to the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for fiction at the same time it was being touted by experts in Asperger&#x27;s syndrome and autism-spectrum disorders as an unrivaled fictional depiction of the inner workings of an autistic teenage boy.

===Metaphor===
Christopher often comments on his inability to appreciate some metaphors. He gives as an example a quote that he found in &quot;a proper novel&quot;: &quot;I am veined with iron, with silver, and with streaks of common mud. I cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench who do not depend on stimulus.&quot; Haddon told NPR journalist Terry Gross, &quot;Funnily enough, it&#x27;s actually a quote from Virginia Woolf. It&#x27;s Virginia Woolf on an off day, in the middle, I think, of &quot;The Waves&quot;. An author whom I love actually, but who sometimes got a little too carried away.&quot;

=== Multimodality ===
The novel is developed in various semiotic modes or resources: maps, diagrams, pictures, smileys, and the like, which are not ornamental but crucial to the understanding of the novel. This means that Haddon&#x27;s novel can be conceived as multimodal.

== Reception ==

=== Awards ===
=== Critical reaction ===
Upon release, &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; was generally well-received among the British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, and &quot;Independent&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; review under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; review under &quot;Rubbish&quot;. The book was also generally well-received amongst American press. According to Book Marks, the book received a &quot;rave&quot; consensus, based on eight critic reviews: seven &quot;rave&quot; and one &quot;positive&quot;. On the September/October 2003 issue of Bookmarks, the book received (4.0 out of 5) stars, based on critic reviews.

A 2006 survey in Great Britain, conducted by the BBC&#x27;s literacy campaign for World Book Day, found &quot;Curious Incident&quot; to be among &quot;the top five happy endings, as voted on by readers&quot; in novels (the others were &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;Rebecca&quot;, the last of which &quot;Curious&quot; outranked).

&quot;School Library Journal&quot; praised it as a &quot;rich and poignant novel&quot;. The &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; said: &quot;Haddon does something audacious here, and he does it superbly. He shows us the way consciousness orders the world, even when the world doesn&#x27;t want to be ordered&quot;, adding that &quot;the great achievement of this novel is that it transcends its obvious cleverness. It&#x27;s more than an exercise in narrative ingenuity. Filled with humor and pain, it verges on profundity in its examination of those things—customs, habits, language, symbols, daily routines, etc.—that simultaneously unite and separate human beings.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;The Christian Century&quot; described it as &quot;an absorbing, plausible book&quot;: &quot;The reader becomes absorbed not only in the mystery of a murdered dog and a missing mom, but also in the mysterious world of an autistic child.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; wrote that the story is &quot;a touching evolution, one that Haddon scripts with tenderness and care... a unique window into the mind of a boy who thinks a little differently, but like many kids his age, doesn&#x27;t quite know how to feel.&quot; Professor Roger Soder called it &quot;visceral&quot; and a &quot;delightful story&quot;, declaring, &quot;All of us in our Spokane Book Club are special education professionals and so have considerable experience with kids with this disability, and we found the story believable.&quot;

Cathy Lowne of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; wrote that &quot;Haddon&#x27;s skill lies in writing so that, although Christopher may be unaware of emotional undercurrents and nuances of mood, the reader is made aware of them.&quot;

In 2019, the book was ranked 19th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.

=== Medical professionals&#x27; reviews ===
Alex McClimens, whom Muller quoted above, also wrote: &quot;This magnificent essay in communication is compulsory reading for anyone with the slightest interest in autistic spectrum disorders. This book is also required reading for those who simply enjoy a fascinating story... we are offered a first person narrative to match anything by contemporary writers. Mark Haddon has created a true literary character and his handling of the teenage Asperger&#x27;s heroic adventure is brilliantly crafted. He uses the literal mind-set of his hero to mask the true direction of the plot.&quot; Reviewer Paul Moorehead calls the book &quot;a fairly ripping adventure story&quot; and writes: &quot;It&#x27;s also quite a feat of writing. The actual use of language is somewhat austere—an unavoidable consequence of having a boy with autism as a narrator—but it has its own beauty, and it works. So persuasive and so effective is the construction of Christopher, not only is he a character you&#x27;re rooting for, he&#x27;s also the character in the story you understand the best. It&#x27;s startling how believably and comfortably this story puts you into what you might have thought were likely to be some pretty alien shoes.&quot;

Reviewer David Ellis, naming &quot;The Curious Incident&quot; an &quot;ambitious and innovative novel&quot;, wrote that Haddon &quot;manages to avoid the opposing pitfalls of either offending people with autism and their families or turning Christopher into an object of pity. Instead of becoming the focus of the plot the autism enhances it. The unemotional descriptions amplify many moments of observational comedy, and misfortunes are made extremely poignantly.&quot; He concludes that Christopher&#x27;s story is &quot;far more enjoyable and likely to stay with you for far longer than any medical textbook&quot;.

=== Challenges ===
&quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; has frequently been challenged due to its offensive language, supposed unsuitability for younger readers, and religious viewpoint. On the American Library Association&#x27;s lists of the most banned and challenged books, the book landed in the 51st spot between 2010 and 2019, and the fifth spot in 2015.

== Adaptations ==

<doc id="890630" wikidata="Q442202" url="?curid=890630" title="Vanna White">
<text>Vanna Marie White (née Rosich; born February 18, 1957) is an American television personality and game-show hostess, best known as the co-host of the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, a position she has held since 1982. She began her career as a model while studying fashion, competing in Miss Georgia USA in 1978. In addition to her work on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, she has played minor characters or appeared as herself in many films and television series, and is the author of the 1987 autobiography &quot;Vanna Speaks&quot;. She also participates in real-estate investment, owns the yarn brand Vanna&#x27;s Choice, and is a patron of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

==Early life==
Vanna Marie Rosich was born on February 18, 1957, near North Myrtle Beach in Horry County, South Carolina. She is the daughter of Joan Marie (Nicholas) and Miguel Angel Rosich. According to census records, her paternal (Rosich) second great-grandparents were Spanish immigrants from Mallorca who settled in Ponce, Puerto Rico. When Vanna was an infant, her parents divorced. She was raised by her mother Joan and by Joan&#x27;s second husband, Herbert White Jr. (1925–2022), a former real estate broker, in North Myrtle Beach. Vanna took White&#x27;s surname. After graduating from high school, White moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where she attended the Atlanta School of Fashion and Design and worked as a model. White headed to Los Angeles in 1979 to pursue an acting career, but in the summer of 1980, she returned briefly to South Carolina to see her mother, who was dying of ovarian cancer.

==Career==
===Television, motion picture, and other media appearances===

Before her appearance on TV, White was a contestant in the Miss Georgia USA 1978 pageant.

White&#x27;s first appearance on a game show was on the June 20, 1980, episode of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, where she was among the first four contestants. White did not make it on stage, but the clip of her running to Contestants&#x27; Row was rebroadcast as part of &quot;The Price Is Right 25th Anniversary Special&quot; in August 1996 and &quot;The Price Is Right Celebrates 50 Years&quot; in September 2021 (in which she also appeared as a Guest Model during the show), and also was featured on the special broadcast &quot;Game Show Moments Gone Bananas&quot;.

In 1980, White acted in a film that was not completed; it was subsequently edited and released in June 1990 as &quot;Gypsy Angels&quot;. In 1981, she got a bit part in the film &quot;Looker&quot; and also appeared as Doris in the horror movie &quot;Graduation Day&quot;, an American slasher film directed by Herb Freed and produced by Troma Entertainment.

White&#x27;s 1987 autobiography, &quot;Vanna Speaks!&quot;, was a best-seller. That same year, she was featured in a &quot;Playboy&quot; pictorial, showing photos taken of her before her career on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, wearing see-through lingerie. White starred as the title character, Venus, in the 1988 television movie &quot;Goddess of Love&quot;. 

White has made cameo appearances on television shows such as &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;227&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;, &quot;Simon and Simon&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot; and in films such as &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; (1994) &quot;Double Dragon&quot; (1994) and the Australian variety series Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday.

White guest-starred on &quot;Married...With Children&quot;; in a gender-bending parody of the film &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, she had the Robert Redford role while Al Bundy had that of Demi Moore. White served as guest timekeeper and provided interviews from the backstage area throughout the evening for &quot;WrestleMania IV&quot;. In 1996, she was the main narrator and singer in the CD release of Leslie Bricusse&#x27;s &quot;Santa&#x27;s Last Ride.&quot;

On April 20, 2006, White was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Pat Sajak, Merv Griffin, and Alex Trebek as key witnesses.

White lent her voice to the Canadian animated television special &quot;The Real Story of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&quot; and the American animated television series &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;.

White presented a set of luggage in a special guest appearance on &quot;The Price Is Right Celebrates 50 Years&quot; in September 2021.

In May 2022, White appeared as a special guest in the seventh season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race: All Stars&quot; where the contestants did a runway in tribute to her past looks.

On April 21, 2023, it was announced that White would be featured in a four-episode documentary by ABC News titled &quot;The Game Show Show&quot;, covering the history of game shows in America over the last eight decades. The four-part documentary premiered on May 10, 2023.

===&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; television game show===
After &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; hostess Susan Stafford left in October 1982, White was selected as one of three substitute hostesses (along with Vicki McCarty and Summer Bartholomew) to co-host the show. On December 13, 1982, White became the regular hostess.

White temporarily took over hosting &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; as master of ceremonies starting with the week of episodes that were slated to air starting on December 9, 2019. The announcement was made after a taping day was postponed when Sajak was hospitalized with a blocked intestine and needed emergency surgery to clear it. White hosted that taping day and the subsequent rescheduled taping the next day. Guest letter activators were implemented during her shows hosting; the weeks of December 9 and 16 had Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse during the &quot;Secret Santa Holiday Giveaway&quot;. Subsequently, the show went on hiatus during Christmas week (December 23, 2019) and then a week of previously taped &quot;America&#x27;s Game&quot; episodes (&quot;Wheel&quot; tapes six episodes per day, with each studio audience receiving three shows each; the third show in the afternoon session is an &quot;America&#x27;s Game&quot; episode) that Sajak hosted, before White returned to hosting on January 6, 2020, for a final week; she was assisted by a &quot;special guest&quot;, Pat Sajak&#x27;s daughter Maggie. Fully recovered from his surgery, Sajak returned to the show on December 5, 2019, with episodes airing on January 13, 2020.

White missed filming five episodes in August 2023 after contracting COVID-19. She was temporarily replaced by Bridgette Donald-Blue but returned as hostess in October 2023. Filming on additional episodes was delayed until after her recovery. This marked the first time that White had missed an episode since 1991. 

Since 2021, Sajak and White hosted &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot; on ABC. Later in the year it was announced that both Sajak and White have been signed on to continue as hosts of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; through the 2023–24 season. She extended her contract on &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot; again in July 2023. In September 2023, White extended her contract as host of Wheel of Fortune through the 2025–26 season.

In May 2023, White competed as a contestant on a celebrity edition of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; against &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; hosts Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik.

===Real-estate investing===
White uses her income to invest in apartment buildings, and she likes flipping houses. In 2017, White listed her Beverly Hills home for $47.5 million. In 2023, she began renting her home in Sherman Oaks.

===Crochet and knitting endorsements===
When White was five, her grandmother taught her how to crochet. White had lost interest in the hobby over time, until on the &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; set, she noticed her pregnant hairdresser was crocheting a baby blanket for herself. White told her that she previously crocheted and asked the hairdresser to help her relearn crochet. When she has downtime on the set, White often crochets, as she finds it very relaxing and has something to show for the time she has spent doing it.

White began her relationship with Lion Brand Yarns when she spoke about her love of crochet on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;; the yarn company subsequently contacted her and negotiated a contract. White has her own line of yarn called Vanna&#x27;s Choice and endorses crochet and knitting books published in her name.

===World record===
White is famous for her seamless revealing of letters on the game board, her smile, and her constant clapping in support of each episode&#x27;s contestants. On the May 24, 2013 episode of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, White was presented with a Guinness World Record certificate for most frequent clapper. As of January 31, 2013, she had clapped an estimated 3,480,864 times across the show&#x27;s 30 seasons. White had appeared in all but 10 of &quot;Wheel&quot;″s 5,754 episodes to that point, during the show&#x27;s modern syndicated run, which began on September 19, 1983. That works out to an average number of 606 claps per show.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s, White dated and became engaged to soap opera actor John Gibson, a &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine centerfold and Chippendales dancer. However, Gibson died in a 1986 airplane crash. In 1990, White married restaurant owner George Santo Pietro. She first became pregnant in September 1992. An episode of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; contained &quot;Vanna&#x27;s pregnant&quot; as the answer to a puzzle. She miscarried shortly after the episode&#x27;s taping. White gave birth to a son in 1994 and a daughter in 1997 from her marriage to Santo Pietro. The couple divorced in November 2002. From 2004 to 2006, she was engaged to Southern California businessman Michael Kaye. The two never wed. Since 2012, White has been in a relationship with contractor John Donaldson, whom she met through mutual friends.

White is a Baptist.

White is sometimes described as the &quot;niece&quot; of actor Christopher George. While George is not a biological relation, White&#x27;s mother grew up with him, and George and his wife took White &quot;under their wing&quot; in Los Angeles. In an interview with Larry King, White said that her children often come to &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; tapings.

On April 1, 2022, White announced that her stepfather, Herbert White Jr., had died peacefully that morning.

===Philanthropy===
As of 2019, White has donated $1.8 million to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and plans to continue her philanthropy after her retirement.

==Litigation==
In 1993, White sued Samsung Electronics over an advertisement featuring a robot turning letters on a game show, alleging a violation of her personality rights. The lower court&#x27;s decision in Samsung&#x27;s favor was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which denied a rehearing, but Judge Alex Kozinski issued a dissent. The U.S. Supreme Court denied &quot;certiorari&quot;. A jury awarded White $403,000 in damages.

==In popular culture==
* Parody song &quot;Vanna, Pick Me a Letter&quot; (a riff on Wayne Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Letter&quot;) was released by David Kolin (aka Dr. Dave) in 1987. 
* The second track of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s 1988 album, &quot;Even Worse&quot;, features the song &quot;Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White&quot;.
* The 2001 Nelly single &quot;Ride wit Me&quot;, mentions White with the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B. Telling me bout a party up in NYC. And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight, paying cash, first class, sitting next to Vanna White…&quot;

<text>Lithuanian grammar retains many archaic features from Proto-Balto-Slavic that have been lost in other Balto-Slavic languages.

==Properties and morphological categories==

===Grammatical terminology===

===Gender===

Lithuanian nouns are classified into one of two genders:
*masculine
*feminine

Lithuanian adjectives, numerals, pronouns and participles are classified into one of three genders:

*masculine
*feminine
*neuter

Since no noun can have a neutral gender, it is used with subjects of neutral or undefined gender:

*Ji () yra graži () – She is beautiful.
*Mokytojas () bus pasirengęs () – The teacher will be ready.
*Skaityti buvo įdomu (&quot;neuter&quot;) – Reading was interesting.

The gender of a pronoun kas – &#x27;who? what?&#x27;, personal pronouns aš / mes – &#x27;I&#x27; / &#x27;we&#x27;, tu / jūs – &#x27;you (singular) / you (plural)&#x27; and a reflexive pronoun savęs is indefinite, it means any of the genders. The word &quot;kas&quot; uses masculine inflections, the other pronouns have their own specific paradigm. The nouns of the indefinite gender have feminine form inflections.

The masculine gender is also the indeterminate gender as in many other Indo-European languages. This means that for an entire mixed group of objects belonging to masculine and feminine genders, the masculine gender is used. The masculine as the indeterminate gender differs from the indefinite gender, which allows treatment of the word in two ways.

Note that there are many nouns that use masculine or feminine genders without any reason of biological gender, for instance, words that denote inanimate objects. The masculine or feminine usage of these words is stable (with few exceptions) and doesn&#x27;t depend on the will of a speaker.

Lithuanian grammatical genders are similar to, for instance, Latin:

===Grammatical number===

The Lithuanian language has two main numbers, singular and plural. It has also a dual number, which is used in certain dialects, such as Samogitian. Some words in the standard language retain their dual forms (for example &quot;du&quot; (&quot;two&quot;) and &quot;abu&quot; (&quot;both&quot;), an indefinite number and super-plural words (&quot;dauginiai žodžiai&quot; in Lithuanian). Dual forms of pronouns used in the standard language are also optional.

The singular number indicates that the denoted thing is one or indivisible (as in méilė – love, smė̃lis – sand, píenas – milk). The plural number, when it can be in contrast with the singular, indicates that there are many of the things denoted by the word. But sometimes, when a word doesn&#x27;t have the singular number, being a plurale tantum noun, the plural form doesn&#x27;t indicate real singularity or plurality of the denoted object(s).

Adjectives and numerals also have the singular-plural distinction. Their number depends on that of the noun they are attributed to.

The dual number indicates a pair of things. Historically, the dual number has been a full grammatical number, participating as the third element in singular-dual – plural distinction. During the last century, the dual was used more or less sporadically in Lithuanian, sometimes reaching the status of a full number for agreement purposes, meaning the dual of noun required dual agreement in its adjectives or the dual of the subject required the dual of the verb. But in many more cases the dual was reduced to a nominal category explicitly indicating a pair of things, but not requiring dual agreement of adjectives or verbs. Presently, the dual is mostly used as a declension paradigm for numbers du – two, abu – both (and a variant abudu – idem) and with personal pronouns aš – I, mùdu – we two (mẽs – we) and tu – you, jùdu – you two (jū̃s – you).

The indefinite number indicates that the same form of the word can be understood singular or plural, depending both on situation and on other words in the sentence. There are only few words that demonstrate indefinite number, and the indefinite number doesn&#x27;t have its own forms in Lithuanian. These words are pronouns &quot;kas&quot; – &#x27;who? what?&#x27;, &quot;kažkas&quot; – &#x27;something, somebody&#x27; and reflexive pronoun &quot;savęs&quot;. All of them use inflections of the singular.

The super-plural words are a few numbers and pronouns that indicate a counting not of separate things, but of groups of things.

:keleri – &#x27;several (groups of)&#x27;
:abeji – &#x27;both (groups of)&#x27;
:(vieneri – &#x27;one (group of)&#x27;)
:dveji – &#x27;two (groups of)&#x27;
:treji – &#x27;three (groups of)&#x27;
:ketveri – &#x27;four (groups of)&#x27;
:penkeri – &#x27;five (groups of)&#x27;
:šešeri – &#x27;six (groups of)&#x27;
:septyneri – &#x27;seven (groups of)&#x27;
:aštuoneri – &#x27;eight (groups of)&#x27;
:devyneri – &#x27;nine (groups of)&#x27;

These words are also used with plurale tantum nouns instead of plural words (&quot;keli&quot;, &quot;abu&quot;, &quot;du&quot;, &quot;trys&quot; and so on), in which case they indicate not the plural of groups, but just the semantic plural or singular (a word &quot;vieneri&quot; – &#x27;one&#x27; only) of the noun.

===Cases of declined words===
* Nominative – vardininkas
* Genitive – kilmininkas; it also functions similarly to the ablative case in other languages.
* Dative – naudininkas
* Accusative – galininkas
* Instrumental – įnagininkas
* Locative cases:
:* Locative (inessive) – vietininkas
:* Illative – (iliatyvas, sometimes referred as kryptininkas); dialectal, without clear status in the standard Lithuanian
:* Allative; obsolete, the singular is reduced to adverbs
:* Adessive; extinct
* Vocative – šauksmininkas

Examples of the locative cases:
*inessive is fully used locative case (and the only one of Indo-European origin, the following three being borrowed to Uralic). An example: nãmas – a house, namè – in a house, vyruose – in men. It is also used for a temporal meaning in some words: vakarè – in the evening (vãkaras &#x27;an evening&#x27;). But more nouns are used in accusative for the latter meaning: vãsarą – in summer, rùdenį – in autumn, trẽčią vãlandą – in three o&#x27;clock. This accusative form also means duration: trečią dieną kepina (kepina is idiomatic or slang in such meaning) – it is the third day when it (sun) sizzles (its heat). Plural forms for temporal &quot;locatives&quot; are expressed by instrumental: vakaraĩs – in / by evenings, vãsaromis – in / by summers.
*illative is used sparingly. Some terms are normal, for example, in law: patráukti baudžiamõjon atsakomýbėn – to prosecute; literally: to draw, pull, move to penal amenability (not į (&quot;to&quot;) baudžiamają atsakomybę , not (&quot;for&quot;) baudžiamajai atsakomybei &quot;dative&quot;). Other examples: singular káiman – to(wards) the village, miškañ – to(wards) a forest, and forms of the common language į káimą, į mìšką; plural káimuos-na, miškúos-na and common forms į káimus, į miškùs;
*allative. Examples: namop – up to the home. Today it is used only in a few idiomic expressions like vakaróp – about nightfall, velnióp – to hell with smth.; šuniop – down the drain (about dog, to a dog); galóp – ultimately; nuteisti myriop – to send to the scaffold;
*adessive. Examples: laukíe-p – beside the field, at the field, namíe-p . It is a historical or dialectal case, extinct in modern standard Lithuanian, but it is preserved in the adverbs: namie – at home, netoli(e) – not far, toli(e) – far, arti(e) – nearby, vienaip ar kitaip – anyway, savaip – in one&#x27;s own fashion/way, tavaip – in your () fashion/way, visaip – diversely. etc.

The later three locatives are adverb-forming cases.

==Nouns==
Lithuanian grammar makes a distinction between proper and common nouns. Only proper nouns are capitalized. Some nouns, for example sun and moon, can be both proper and common. There are no articles in Lithuanian.

The genders of nouns are masculine and feminine. A rough rule of thumb is that almost all masculine nouns in nominative case end in &quot;-s&quot; and most feminine in &quot;-(i)a&quot; or &quot;-ė&quot;. There are no strict rules governing the gender. For example, upė – river, is feminine, but upelis – rivulet, is masculine. There is no neuter gender (&quot;it gender&quot;), but there are a few words that can be applied to both genders equally. They mostly describe people, have negative connotations, and end in &quot;-a&quot;, for example vė́pla – dummy, el̃geta – beggar, naktìbalda – night-lumberer, a person who does not sleep at night, but mėmė̃ – gawk.

There are no separate declension paradigms for animate and inanimate nouns in Lithuanian.

===Number===
Most nouns have singular and plural numbers. There are some words that have only singular (e.g., pienas – &quot;milk&quot;, auksas – &quot;gold&quot;, gripas – &quot;flu&quot;, laimė – &quot;happiness&quot;) or only plural (e.g., lubos – &quot;ceiling&quot;, miltai – &quot;flour&quot;, kelnės – &quot;trousers&quot;) forms. Most such words are abstract (i.e., represent concepts like &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;love&quot; and not tangible things such as &quot;table&quot; or &quot;house&quot;), describe material or name a disease. However, in some instances, for example poetic language, it is possible to use singular nouns in plural form.

====Noun modification by numeral====
In Lithuanian the choice of form when a count noun is to be used in conjunction with a number depends on the &quot;final digits&quot; of the number in question. The distribution of number and case differs somewhat from the similar systems used in Slavic languages. This system stands in stark contrast to those of Romance and Germanic languages.

Note: Plural or singular without the case means that the word or words can be declined in any case in plural or singular respectively, but Plural genitive means that the second word remains undeclined.

===Declension===
Nouns in Lithuanian language have 12 declension paradigms, in scholar grammar corresponding to five declensions which are defined by the inflection in singular nominative and genitive cases. Only few borrowed words, like taksì – taxi, kupė – compartment (in a train), coupe, are not subject to declension rules.

# There are only two nouns ending in -i: pati &#x27;wife&#x27; and marti &#x27;daughter-in-law&#x27;. Their declension is the same to the second adjective feminine declension and similar to a second feminine noun palatalized declension. The noun pati is the same to a pronoun pati &#x27;herself; myself ; itself (for feminine nouns)&#x27;
# Exception: petys – shoulder, peties, etc., after this declensional pattern. The third declension is very similar to the fifth declension.
# Duktė &#x27;daughter&#x27; is the only word of the fifth declension, not having an ending uo. A word moteris &#x27;woman, female&#x27; often has a genitive móters; the plural genitive of moteris is moterų (not palatalized -ių); it is the only normal form for the fifth declension and one of the two (the main is -ių) for the third. The more two words, obelis – apple tree and dieveris – (older) brother-in-law, are the same declensional case as moteris, but dieveris, being masculine possibly has a -iu. Dieveris is also the only -er- masculine case.
===Typology===
In the table below the numbers of nouns, received by the statistical analysis of the data in the Dictionary of contemporary Lithuanian language (Dabartinės Lietuvių kalbos žodynas; the fourth issue, 2000), are given grouped by the patterns of declension and accentuation. The data does not include verbal abstracts ending in -imas, -ymas, -umas (for instance, metimas &#x27;a throwing; a throw&#x27; from mesti &#x27;to throw&#x27;), 18,700 in total (12,000 of the first accentuation paradigm, 6,000 of the second), because they can be made from any verb. There may be some inaccuracies due to some specific features, for instance, there are homonyms which differ only in an accent: síetas 1 – sieve (related to sijóti – to sieve), siẽtas 2 – tether, leash (related to siẽti – to tie, bond; saĩtas – bond; leash), and the possibility exists that in some of such cases the two words were taken as one.

Words with a suffix -men-, are attributed to the third declensional pattern in these tables, but they are of the fifth, the singular (can be used for all, but is not usual for all) is -uo: for example, ãšmenys 3b – blade, sė́dmenys 3a – buttocks, nates, sėdmuõ , nẽšmenys 3b – silts, sediments carried by a water stream. The singular instrumental is -imi, like in the third declension, while for masculine words of the fifth declension the proper ending is chosen to be -iu; but -imi can also be chosen for the words of the fifth declension.


The numbers in the upper row mean accentuation types. For the third type the additional information is given in dictionaries. The mark 3 without the letter added, is for words, stressed in the next-to-last syllable. The letter after is for polysyllabic words and says what type of stress the syllable has in those cases where the stress falls on the stem (other cases receive it on the ending) and how distant from the ending the syllable stressed is. The letter &quot;a&quot; is for a start-firm (tvirtapradė priegaidė) accent and the letter &quot;b&quot; – for an end-firm (tvirtagalė priegaidė) and short stressed vowel. The single digit with a letter means that the stress falls on the third syllable from the ending; if the stress falls on the fourth syllable from the ending, the mark is 34a or 34b, there are also nouns having stress in the fifth (35a, 35b) and sixth (36b) syllable from the ending. Here are a few examples of nouns of the third accentuation pattern, the singular nominative and the plural dative and accusative cases: akmuõ, akmenìms, ãkmenis; áugalas, augaláms, áugalus; žándas, žandáms, žándus. The first declension also includes nouns stressed in a syllable more distant from the ending than the next-to-last, but their stress is steady throughout the cases and is always clear from the nominative singular.

In the left column the nominative singular endings of words, grouped by declensional paradigms, are given: -as, -is, -ys, -ias (masculine gender) – the first; -a (-ia), -ė (feminine gender; some other) – II; -is (feminine, some other) – III; -us (-ius) (masculine) – IV; -uo (masculine; two feminine) – V. The palatalized variants of -as, -a, -us types, that is, -ias, -ia, -ius, are counted together with those having -j- before the inflectional ending: -j-as, -j-a, -j-us.

The letters , , mean gender: – feminine, – masculine, – common (is understood as either of the genders). The column under the abbreviation alt. is for alternative forms, for instance, a word grobuonis 2, 3a – predator (of the third declension), can be accentuated in two types: (2) grobuõnis, grobuõnies, grobuõniui; (3a) grobuonìs, grobuoniẽs, gróbuoniui.



;The first declension, -as, -is, -ys, -ias.
*Names of -as type have vocative -ai instead of -e of common nouns: Jõnas – Jõnai, Tòmas – Tòmai. Common nouns sometimes have this ending, it is usual for a word tė́vas: tė́vai and tė́ve.
*Words having -j- before the ending -as (vė́jas – wind, naudótojas – user) have two differences of declensional cases from other -as words; -j- is soft sound and the locative for these words is like in soft -is / -ys / -ias type (mẽdyje, kepsnyjè, kelyjè), but with a vowel changed where needed for an easier pronunciation: vė́jyje, but naudótojuje. Vocative is also different: vėjau, naudótojau (naudotoje would sound the same as naudótoja, which is feminine (nominative and vocative) form of the same word. The vocative is similar for -as and -ė words: ą́žuolas – oak : ą́žuole and ẽglė – spruce : ẽgle). This form is sometimes present in other cases: brólis : voc. bróli and brolaũ, vélnias : vélniau. Many of these -j- words are made with an actors (personal, not for things) suffix -ėjas , -ėja , -t-ojas , -t-oja : veĩkti &#x27;to act, affect; operate&#x27; – veikė́jas &#x27;actor, character&#x27;; naudóti &#x27;to use&#x27; – naudótojas &#x27;user&#x27;.
*There are only a few -ias words, they are declined like -ys words, except some cases: nominative for kẽlias, nominative and vocative for elnias – elni, and vélnias – vélniau.
*-is and -ys words differ in that -is words (with the short i sound) are stressed on the stem (I, II accentuation patterns) and -ys words (with the same sound, but long) are stressed on the ending (III, IV accentuation patterns). In the -is type almost half of the nouns have consonants t, d in the stem ending. These consonants change when palatalized: mẽdis – mẽdžio etc. (in the -as paradigm, on the other hand, there are no cases with palatalization: vardas – vardo etc.). In the -ys type about 12% of nouns have t, d as stem ending.

;The second, -a (-ia), -ė ( -ės)
*a type; twelve nouns are of masculine gender: viršilà 2 – warrant-officer, sergeant, barzdylà 2 – bearded one (person) ( barzdỹlos; it can also be heard barzdýla 1, barzdýlos; this is either a mistake and outcome of nivellation of accents or a type of word formation without changing an accent, compare adjectives, for example, ausýlas , -a &#x27;sharp-eard&#x27;), vaivadà – voivode (historical office) (it is attributed to be of the 2 accentuation type in vocabularies, but it is of 3 or 1 if used in language: vaivadà 3, vaĩvadai or vaĩvada 1), maršálka 1 – historical office: mareschalus, marshal. 265 – of common gender: mušeikà 2 (1) – scrapper, bruiser, personà 2 – personage, nebrendilà 2 – immaturely behaving person (in language can also be heard nebrendýla 1, nebrendylà 2), nekláužada 1 – tinker (kid), namìsėda 1 – home-keeping, who sits at home. Two words have -i ending: martì 4 – daughter-in-law, patì 4 – wife (more like older).
*ė type; four nouns are masculine: dė̃dė 2 – uncle, tė̃tė 2 (more used or equal variant is tė̃tis 2) – dad, dailìdė 2 – carpenter, woodworker and ciùcė 2 – doggy (in kid speech). 19 words are of common gender: garsenýbė 1 – renowned (person, thing), tauškalỹnė 2 – wind-bag, gasser, mėmė̃ 4 – gawk, spiegėlė̃ 3b – who shrieks too much (the latter word, for example, is not very likely to be heard, a word spieglỹs, -ė̃ 4 would probably occur). The t, d stems in -ė are present in the following percentage through the four accentuation paradigms: I – 15%, II – 35%, III – 23%, IV – 12%.

;The third, -is
*There were 245 feminine and 24 masculine nouns in this class. 6 nouns have common gender: (the first three can also be attributed to masculine gender) palikuõnis 2, 34b &#x27;progeny, offspring&#x27;, grobuõnis 2, 3a &#x27;predator&#x27;, žiniuõnis 2, 4 &#x27;knower; witchdoctor&#x27;, delsuonìs 3b &#x27;who is dallying&#x27;, giežuonìs 3b &#x27;tiresome, sour (person)&#x27;, vagìs 4 &#x27;thief&#x27;. Some other -uonis words are attributed to a masculine gender, for example, geluonìs 3b (2) – sting, deguõnis 2 (3b) (here in the table given as 3b, while 2 accentuation pattern is probably more used) – oxygen. A word vinìs , 4 &#x27;nail, spike&#x27; is also sometimes understood as of common gender. The singular dative is -iui for the common gender, like in masculine nouns. The biggest part of these words have -t- stem. The second accentuation pattern is the rarest, among its examples are: durys 2 &#x27;door&#x27;, slistis 2 (4) &#x27;simulation&#x27;, gaištis 2, 4 &#x27;dallying&#x27; (the two latter can also be accentuated in the fourth paradigm), masculine: pirmuõnys – protozoa, deguõnis (3b) – oxygen. Words with a suffix -men-, for example, ãšmenys 3b – blade, sė́dmenys 3a – buttocks, nates, nẽšmenys 3b – silts, sediments carried by a water stream, are attributed to the third declensional pattern here, but they are of the fifth: the singular (can be used for all, but is not usual for all) is -uo: sėdmuõ – buttock. The singular instrumental is -imi, like in the third declension, while for masculine words of the fifth declension the proper ending is given to be -iu; but -imi can also be and is chosen for the words of the fifth declension.

;The fourth, -us, -ius
*There are only 19 words with a non-palatalized ending, and more -j-us, and -ius words.

;The fifth, -uo, -ė ( -ers) 
*The number of words of this class is small. The words are of the third accentuation pattern; one word, šuõ – dog, is of the fourth and has -imì. One word, or maybe even some more, is of the first accentuation pattern, rė́muo – waterbrash (it can also be accentuated in the third pattern).

About 45% of all nouns are feminine, 55% – masculine.

====Grouping by a syllable nucleus of a pre-desinential syllable====
In the tables below the possibilities of syllable nucleus of the next-to-last syllable and their accent is shown. The different sound of a next-to-last syllable makes no grammatical distinction, for example, words nóras – wish and kū́nas – body, are of the same declensional and accentuation patterns. But there are a few certain differences in the accentuation features of the nucleus sounds of the next-to-last syllable. Most vowels and diphthongs can take either of the accents: a start-firm or an end-firm. Short a, e sounds, when they are in a stem of a word and stressed, lengthen and have always an end-firm accent; i, u are short and there is no accentual differentiation in their stress. Mixed diphthongs (a, e) + (l, m, n, r) have the first element lengthened when stressed in a start-firm accent, when in (i, u) + (l, m, n, r) and a diphthong ui the first element remains short in the same case. The words having ą, ę in a pre-desinential syllable are not included here because of the lack of declensional types. Some examples: rą̃stas 2 – balk, timber; žąsìs 4 – goose; ąsà 4 – handle; kę́sas 3 – hassock.

The four different accentuation patterns are distinguished by two different colors in the rows of the table, their sequence is from the top to the bottom – I, II, III, IV. The words of each accentuation type are given in the following sequence of the declensional types:
*The first declension (masculine)
:*-as,
:*-is (I–II accentuational pattern) / -ys (III–IV accentuational patterns) and a few -ias words. Their genitive singular is -io.
*The second declension (feminine)
:*-a (-ia)
:*-ė
*The third declension (mostly feminine, few masculine): -is; genitive singular is -ies
*The fourth declension (masculine): -us (-ius)

Some spaces of the tables are not filled, but this does not mean that there are no words which would fit. The sounds a, e (end-firm when stressed) and i, u (short) can not be start-firm and consequently the word having them in the next-to-last stressed syllable can not be of the first and the third accentuation pattern. Some of the declensional types include few words, for example there are only two words of the third accentuation pattern in the fifth declension: sūnùs and lietùs. The number of words (Dictionary of contemporary Lithuanian language / Dabartinės Lietuvių kalbos žodynas; the fourth issue, 2000) of the declensional patterns can be checked in the section above.

After some of the words in the tables, a number is added. It indicates an alternative existent accentuation pattern and is given only for some of the words that have an alternative accentuation in the language. Notice that the type of accentuation of a word is shown by the place in the table and the number added means only an alternative accentuation type, which is not necessarily the main one. Some of the alternative accentuation patterns of a word are used equally often (then they are given not in brackets here), some are known from dialects, not preferred (then they are given in brackets).

Here are some illustrations of the alternative accentuation: a word nykštỹs 3 is also commonly said nýkštis 1; zýlė 1 is also known as zylė̃ 3 in some dialects, but this form is used more narrowly and not shown here. Similarly, a word rýkštė 1 is also known as rykštė̃ 4; this is shown in the table. In the case of šálmas 3 – helmet, the variant šal̃mas 4 is also very common. The alternative forms are most usually present between the 1–3 and 2–4 accentuation patterns, same in the type of accent. But there are also different cases, for example, rýkštė 1 and rykštė̃ 4. The fourth accentuation paradigm can be the result of a shift of the third paradigm. The shift can happen following nivellation of the two accents, a loss of accentual contrast. In the case of nivellation of the start-firm and end-firm accents, the distinction between the 3–4 and 1–2 loses its ground, because in a place of the stress the 1 with the 2, the 3 with the 4 acentuation groups differ only in a few cases.

Among the words given in the table, some are older, for example, ver̃pstė 2 – distaff, sker̃džius 2 – chief cowherd, butcher, and some other. Some words are borrowings: bánkas 1 – bank, tánkas 1 – tank, dùrpės – peat, turf and some other. Old borrowings: vỹnas 2 (4) – wine, blỹnas 2 – pancake, rõžė 2 – rose, rūtà 2 (4) – rue, slyvà 2 (4) – plum, vyšnià 2 (1) – cherry, and some other.





== Adjectives ==

===Formation===
In the same case as in nouns the adjectives may be formed by adding a suffix, e.g., &quot;-inis&quot;, &quot;-ingas&quot; (full in), &quot;-iškas&quot; (alike), &quot;-klus&quot; etc. A further noun iš formed by changing the ending of the adjectives to &quot;-is&quot; (&quot;-ys&quot;), &quot;-ė&quot;. The genitive case is many times used instead of the &quot;-inis&quot;, e.g. &quot;medžio dirbinys&quot; - an artwork from wood, &quot;šokių muzikos gabalas&quot; - dance music piece (&quot;šokinis&quot; would sound awkward). The dative may also used, e.g. &quot;užtiesalas lovai&quot; - a cloth for bed. The adjectival suffix &quot;-inis&quot; may easily become a noun (also &quot;-inys&quot; then), for example, &quot;kosmetinė rankinė (terba / tašė)&quot;, &quot;psichochroninė ligoninė (įstaiga)&quot;.

===Declension===

In Lithuanian, adjectives have three declensions determined by the singular and plural nominative case inflections. Adjectives agree with nouns in number, gender, and case. Unlike nouns, which have two genders – masculine and feminine, adjectives have three (except -is, -ė adjectives), but the neuter adjectives (the third example in the table) have only one form and are not inflected. The neuter gender is formed simply by eliminating the last consonant -s from the masculine gender forms.

All the adjectives (except most -inis type adjectives) can have pronominal (definite) forms that cannot acquire the neuter form:

The pronominal adjectives historically have developed from the combination of the simple adjectives and the respective pronominal forms jis, ji (he, she), that is, gẽras + jìs = geràsis; an example in locative case (feminine gender): gražiosè + josè = gražiósiose. They have their own separate declension paradigms.

Pronominal adjectives have a variety of purposes in modern Lithuanian. One of them is the definitiveness, that is, these adjectives can sometimes act like an equivalent of the definite article in English: &quot;Suvalgiau raudoną obuolį&quot; – &quot;I&#x27;ve eaten a red apple&quot;; &quot;Suvalgiau raudonąjį obuolį&quot; – &quot;I&#x27;ve eaten the red apple&quot;. But they are rarely used this way, as demonstrative pronouns serve better for this purpose. Pronominal adjectives often indicate something unique, thus they are usually used with proper names: Juodoji jūra, Vytautas Didysis, Naujoji Zelandija. Another use (and a very common) is scientific terminology: kvapusis mairūnas, dėmėtoji pelėda, standusis diskas etc. In almost all of these cases, a simple adjective can be used, but it will mean a completely different thing: &quot;juoda jūra&quot; (instead of &quot;Juodoji jūra&quot;) means any sea that is black (not necessarily the particular sea in Eastern Europe); &quot;dėmėta pelėda&quot; (instead of &quot;dėmėtoji pelėda&quot;) means any owl that has dots on its plumage (not necessarily an owl of the &quot;Strix occidentalis&quot; species) etc.
*Most of the first type adjectives of the third declension are with the suffix -in-. These are easily made from other parts of speech by adding the suffix -in-. When made from verbs, they are mostly made from a past passive participle: vìrti – to boil, vìrtas – boiled, virtìnis – which is boiled, made by boiling. Consequently, the suffix is -t-in- for such adjectives. Such variants of verbal derivation easily become nouns (declined in noun declension paradigm), in this case it is a noun virtìnis – dumpling (with mushrooms; curd; etc.; but dumplings with meat are called koldūnai).
* Two adjectives of the third declension have long -ys: dešinỹs – right, kairỹs – left; plural nominative is dešinì, kairì; plural dative: dešiníems, kairíems. A short form of dìdelis, dìdelė is dìdis, didì (similar to pats, pati). Dešinys, kairys, didis have neuter gender of the u pattern: dešinu, kairu, didu. Pronominal forms: didỹsis, didžióji, dešinỹsis, dešinióji. An adjective didelis, didelė hasn&#x27;t pronominal forms. The word didis has more mingled forms: nominative is sometimes didus; genitive : didžio / didaus; accusative: didį (/ didų); plural didūs; other forms are of the regular pattern.
*Some other forms having variations in a standard language: pė́sčias, pėsčià, pė́sčia – pedestrian, afoot; pėsčiàsis, pėsčióji and pėstỹsis, pėsčióji (adjectival and substantival meanings).
In the following examples of noun and adjective matching, gatvė – street and kelias – road are matched with tiesus – straight:
* Tiesi gatvė vs. tiesios gatvės (singular vs. plural)
* Tiesi gatvė vs. tiesus kelias (feminine vs. masculine)
* Tiesi gatvė vs. tiesią gatvę (nominative vs. accusative case)

This does not apply in case of the neuter gender adjectives because nouns do not have neuter gender. Such adjectives are used in combination with other parts of speech having no gender (infinitive, some pronouns) or in zero subject sentences and tend to describe a general environment. For example, &quot;rūsyje buvo vėsu (zero subject sentence) – it was cool in the cellar; gera tave matyti&quot; (the gender neutral infinitive (&quot;matyti&quot;) is the subject) – it&#x27;s good to see you. Moreover, adjectives in neuter can be used as an object (and in some cases – as a subject) as well (a rough equivalent of English &quot;that which is&quot; + adjective): &quot;jis matė šilta ir šalta&quot; – he saw [that which is] cold and hot (he went through fire and water). Adjectives that end in &quot;-is&quot; do not have the neuter gender. Most of the time neuter gender adjectives are written just like feminine adjectives. However, in the spoken language, neuter gender is distinguished by different stress. Also neuter gender does not have any numbers or cases, and it is mostly used for predicatives. Usage in the role of object (like in &quot;jis matė šilta ir šalta&quot;) is rare.

===Degrees of comparison===
The Lithuanian language has five degrees of comparison. The three main degrees are the same as in English language. Note that there are no irregular adjectives and all adjectives have the same suffixes. All such adjectives still need to match the nouns in terms of case, number, and gender. Neuter gender comparative degree is the same as adjective comparative degree.

Adjectives of different degrees can also have their pronominal forms:

== Pronouns ==
Lithuanian has no grammatical category of animacy. Pronouns (including personal ones &quot;jis, ji, jie, jos&quot; (he, she, they)) replace any noun, regardless if it is not animate (people, animals, objects etc.). Whom did you see?&quot; and What did you see?&quot; both translate as Ką tu matei?&quot;; Something is there&quot; and &quot;Somebody is there&quot; both translate as &quot;Ten kažkas yra&quot;.

=== Personal pronouns ===
Personal pronouns &quot;aš&quot; (I), &quot;tu&quot; (you) &quot;jis&quot; (he, it), &quot;ji&quot; (she, it) are declined as follows:

===Reflexive pronoun===

The reflexive pronoun &quot;savęs&quot; is declined like &quot;tu&quot; (&quot;savęs&quot; – &quot;sau&quot; – &quot;save&quot; ...), but it does not have the singular nominative and plural cases.

== Verbs ==

Every Lithuanian verb belongs to one of three different conjugations:

*The first conjugation is the most commonly found in Lithuanian, encompassing those verbs whose infinite form ends in -ati, -oti, -auti, -uoti or a consonant followed by -ti (e.g. dirbti). This conjugation also has the highest occurrence of irregularity of all the Lithuanian verb cases.
*The second conjugation refers to those verbs whose infinitive form ends in -ėti. There are hardly any instances of irregularity for this conjugation. An exception: verbs that have -ėja in the Present Tense (like didėti / didėja / didėjo &#x27;to increase&#x27;) belong to the first conjugation.
*The third conjugation consists of those verbs whose infinitive form ends in -yti. An exception: verbs that have -ija in the Present Tense (like rūdyti / rūdija / rūdijo &#x27;to rust&#x27;) belong to the first conjugation.

In Lithuanian every single verbal form can be derived from three stems: infinitive, 3rd person present tense and 3rd person past tense.

Lithuanian verbs belong to one of the following stem types:

*primary (verbs without suffixes: &quot;pykti, pyksta, pyko&quot; ʽto be angry’). This group encompasses most of the verbs with irregular or unpredictable forms;
*mixed (verbs with suffixes in certain forms: &quot;mylėti, myli, mylėjo&quot; ʽto love’);
*suffixal (verbs with suffixes in all forms: &quot;didėti, didėja, didėjo&quot; ʽto increase’).

The 3rd person of every conjugatable verbal form in Lithuanian has no distinction between numbers: all the singular, dual and plural forms have merged into one single form. &quot;Declinable&quot; forms (such as compound tenses and passive structures), however, must match according to gender and number. This is a shared feature with its closest relative, the Latvian language.

Modern Lithuanian grammarians no longer consider the 3rd person as having an ending, instead it is now called the &quot;final stem vowel&quot; to which a personal ending is attached in order to make the 1st and the 2nd persons:

In reality, however, the attachment of the respective ending to the 3rd person stem is not straightforward and requires additional conversion, e. g. if the 3rd person stem ends in &quot;-a&quot;, the attachment of the ending &quot;-u&quot; to make the 1st person form produces &quot;-u&quot; instead of the expected &quot;-au&quot;. Moreover, certain notable forms have dropped the final vowel in the 3rd person (future tense, conditional mood), however, the forms for other persons are still composed having the stem vowel in mind (dirbti &quot;to work&quot; → dirbs &quot;he will work&quot; → dirbsime &quot;we will work&quot;). Each one of these conversions are being represented in the following conjugation tables.

=== Active voice ===

The active voice in Lithuanian has four moods:

*Indicative
*Indirect
*Imperative
*Conditional

==== Indicative mood ====

In the active voice, the indicative mood contains 4 simple and 7 compound tenses.

In each tense five examples are given: three belonging to each conjugation group (dirbti, norėti, skaityti), one reflexive (praustis) and būti – the only auxiliary verb in Lithuanian.

===== Present tense =====

This is the basic tense in Lithuanian which describes present or ongoing actions or, sometimes, actions without definite tense. Its forms and stress patterns are always derived from the 3rd person of the Present tense.

E.g. dirbu = &#x27;I work&#x27;, (tu) nori = &#x27;You want&#x27;, skaitome = &#x27;We read&#x27; (present tense).

The auxiliary verb bū́ti has two conjugations in the Present tense: an irregular one (based on &quot;es-&quot;/&quot;yr-&quot; stems) and a regular one (based on the &quot;būn-&quot; / &quot;būv-&quot; stem). The difference is that the stem bū̃n-/bū̃v- has an iterative meaning (to be frequently): &quot;Mokiniaĩ yrà pasiruõšę&quot; – &quot;The pupils are ready&quot;; &quot;Mokiniaĩ bū̃na pasiruõšę&quot; – &quot;The pupils are often ready&quot;. The 3rd person form &quot;ẽsti&quot; is semantically equivalent to &quot;bū̃na&quot; or &quot;bū̃va&quot;, but is rarely used in modern Lithuanian. The &quot;bū̃v-&quot; stem is very rare in modern Lithuanian.

In the &quot;-i&quot; conjugation type, the 1st person of singular loses the final stem vowel &quot;-i&quot;, but the last stem consonant becomes palatalized (the sound [ɪ] is absent in &quot;nóriu&quot; [n̪ôːrʲʊ], the letter &quot;i&quot; merely denotes palatalization). If the stem ends with a consonant &quot;-d&quot;, it becomes &quot;-dž&quot;: &quot;girdėti&quot; to hear → &quot;girdi&quot; he hears → &quot;girdžiu&quot; I hear.

The accentuation of all persons always corresponds to the accentuation of the 3rd person. The only exception is when its accented syllable is penultimate (excluding the reflexive formant -si) and has a short vowel (bìjo – he is afraid) or a rising tone (skaĩto – he reads, praũsiasi – he washes himself): in that case the 1st and the 2nd persons of singular move the stress to the ending: bijaũ, bijaĩ; skaitaũ, skaitaĩ; prausiúosi, prausíesi.

===== Past tense =====

This is the basic tense in Lithuanian which describes past actions (ongoing or complete). Its forms and stress patterns are always derived from the 3rd person of the Past tense.

E.g. dirbau = &#x27;I worked&#x27;, norėjai = &#x27;You wanted&#x27;, skaitėme = &#x27;We read&#x27; (past tense)

In the &quot;-ė&quot; conjugation type, the last stem consonant becomes palatalized. If the stem ends with a consonant &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-d&quot;, in the 1st person of singular it becomes &quot;-č&quot; or &quot;-dž&quot; respectively: &quot;kęsti&quot; to suffer → &quot;kentė&quot; he suffered → &quot;kenčiau&quot; I suffered; &quot;melsti&quot; to beg → &quot;meldė&quot; he begged → &quot;meldžiau&quot; I begged.

The accentuation of all persons always corresponds to the accentuation of the 3rd person. The only exception is when its accented syllable is penultimate (excluding the reflexive formant -si) and has a short vowel (bùvo – he was) or a rising tone (skaĩtė – he read, praũsėsi – he washed himself): in that case the 1st and the 2nd persons of singular move the stress to the ending: buvaũ, buvaĩ; skaičiaũ, skaiteĩ; prausiaũsi, prauseĩsi.

===== Past iterative tense =====

The basic meaning of this tense translates as &quot;used to&quot; in English. Its construction is simple:

* Remove the infinitive ending -ti (the stress pattern is always the same as the infinitive).
* Add the suffix -dav- to the stem.
* Finally, add the corresponding ending of the past tense for the first conjugation.

E.g. dirbdavau = &#x27;I used to work&#x27;, norėdavai = &#x27;You used to want&#x27;, skaitydavome = &#x27;We used to read&#x27;

===== Future tense =====

This tense basically describes what will happen in the future. It is relatively simple to form:

* Remove the -ti ending from the infinitive form of the verb.
* Add the -s- suffix which is used to form the Future Tense. Note, that ...š or ...ž + -s- assimilates to š without the final &quot;s&quot; (the infinitive vežti &#x27;to transport&#x27; gives vešiu, veši, veš etc. in the Future Tense). In case the stem itself ends with a final ...s, it is eliminated as well: kąsti (to bite) → kąs.
* Add the appropriate ending.
* All the persons in this tense are completely regular (and retain the stress position and intonation of the infinitive), except for the 3rd one. The latter of this tense changes depending on several rules:

:*If the 3rd person&#x27;s form is stressed in the final or the only syllable with a falling tone (without the inclusion of the reflexive formant -is), it is systematically replaced with a rising tone (kalbė́ti (to speak) → kalbė̃s, pramogáuti (to entertain oneself) → pramogaũs; aukótis (to sacrifice oneself) → aukõsis (the reflexive formant does not count)). This rule does not apply to cases when there the last syllable is not stressed (sáugoti (to protect) → sáugos).

:*Primary verbs acquire a short vowel i or u (instead of long y or ū) when the infinitive and the present tense has a long vowel, but the past tense has a short vowel: (lýti (to rain): lỹja, lìjo → lìs; pū́ti (to rot): pū̃va, pùvo → pùs, most importantly: bū́ti (to be): bū̃na, bùvo → bùs).

E.g. dirbsiu = &#x27;I shall work&#x27;, norėsi = &#x27;You will want&#x27;, skaitysime = &#x27;We shall read&#x27;

===== Compound tenses =====

Compound tenses are periphrastic structures having temporal meanings usually relative to actions indicated by other verbs. Two groups of such tenses exist in modern Lithuanian: Perfect and Inchoative. All of them require an auxiliary verb būti (to be) in its respective form and an active voice participle.

====== Perfect tenses ======

There are four perfect tenses in Lithuanian (present, past, past iterative and future) which are all formed using the verb būti in its respective tense and person as well as the active past simple participle in its respective number and gender:

These tenses (except for present perfect) correspond roughly to equivalent English perfect tenses (I had read / I will have read). They are used in various contexts for very different meanings, but they usually indicate an action that happened before another action said with another verb, noun or similar: &quot;Tos knygos neėmiau, nes jau ją buvau skaitęs&quot; – &quot;I didn&#x27;t take that book because I had already read it&quot;; &quot;Po kelionės vaikai bus labai pasiilgę tėvų&quot; – &quot;After the trip the children will have badly missed their parents&quot;.

They are also used for a generalized meaning not associated with a specific event (equivalent of English &quot;Have you ever done it?&quot;): &quot;Ar esi buvęs Paryžiuje?&quot; – &quot;Have you ever been to Paris [any time in your life]?&quot;; &quot;Esu skaitęs, kad vaistai nuo peršalimo nepadeda&quot; – &quot;I read [some time ago] that pharmaceuticals are useless against common cold&quot;.

Compare phrases: &quot;Ar buvai Paryžiuje?&quot; – &quot;Were you in Paris [that day]?&quot;; &quot;Skaičiau, kad vaistai nuo peršalimo nepadeda&quot; – &quot;I read [that day, at a specific moment in my life] that pharmaceuticals are useless against common cold&quot;.

The perfect tenses are a common feature of the Lithuanian language and are often used in all types of spoken and written speech.

====== Inchoative tenses ======

There are three inchoative tenses in Lithuanian (past, past iterative and future) which are all formed using the verb būti in its respective tense and person, as well as the active present simple participle in its respective number and gender, complemented with the prefix be-. Note the absence of the present inchoative tense.

These tenses mostly indicate an action that was interrupted by another action said with another verb. They correspond roughly to English &quot;...was about to do something, when&quot;: &quot;Tėvas buvo beskaitąs laikraštį, bet kažkas paskambino&quot; – &quot;The father was about to read a newspaper, but someone called&quot;.

They can also indicate an action that have started and is still going on during another action (equivalent of English continuous tenses), but they are almost never used in such a way: &quot;Kai grįši namo, motina bus bemieganti – &quot;When you will get back home, the mother will be sleeping.

Inchoative tenses are not a part of common Lithuanian speech, their use is limited to literary language and even there only past inchoative tense is ever used.

==== Indirect mood ====

The indirect mood in Lithuanian has all and the same tenses (including compound tenses) as the indicative mood, but is not conjugated. Instead of being composed of a conjugatable verb, they are made of pure active participle in nominative case, thus they must match the gender and number of the subject.
The indirect mood of passive voice is also used. It is composed of an auxiliary active participle formed from the verb &quot;būti&quot; &#x27;to be&#x27; and passive participle which is the main one. So, indirect mood of passive voice can only be compound. Both present and past passive participles are used. The indirect mood of passive voice has the following tenses: present (&quot;esąs skaitomas&quot;), present perfect (&quot;esąs skaitytas&quot;), past (&quot;buvęs skaitomas&quot;), past perfect (&quot;buvęs skaitytas&quot;), past iterative (&quot;būdavęs skaitomas&quot;), past iterative perfect (&quot;būdavęs skaitytas&quot;), future (&quot;būsiąs skaitomas&quot;), future perfect (&quot;būsiąs skaitytas&quot;).

The indirect mood, sometimes called &quot;participle speech&quot;, has multiple uses, but primarily denote actions not experienced directly by the speaker and bearing a high degree of uncertainty: &quot;Čia kažkada stovėjusi tvirtovė&quot; – [I&#x27;m not really sure, it seems like] some time ago there stood a fortress here.

Another widely known use of the indirect mood is describing actions in fictional literature (especially folklore) (could be considered as an equivalent of French Passé simple, except that in Lithuanian it is not limited to the past): &quot;Kartą gyvenęs kalvis, kuris turėjęs du sūnus&quot; – Once there lived a smith who had two sons.

In modern Lithuanian this mood is not very widely used, because other ways of expressing uncertainty and fictional events exist.

==== Imperative mood ====

The imperative mood has three forms or tenses (simple, perfect and inchoative). The simple form of the 2nd person of singular, the 1st and the 2nd persons of plural is very regular:

*Remove the infinitive ending -ti (the stress pattern is always the same as the infinitive).
*Add the suffix -k- to the stem.
*Finally, add the corresponding ending.

The 3rd person imperative is sometimes called the &quot;optative mood&quot; and has numerous equivalent forms:

*By adding a simple grammatical prefix te- to the 3rd person of the present tense (tedìrba – let him work). Used moderately often.
*By adding a simple grammatical prefix te- to the 3rd person of the present tense and replacing the ending with -ie or -ai (tedirbiẽ – let him work, teskaĩtai – let him read). Obsolete / rare.
*By adding one of the particles tè, tegùl, tegù, laĩ before the 3rd person of the present tense (or sometimes the future tense): tegùl dìrba – let him work, laĩ skaĩto – let him read. Used very often.

The imperative mood is used to describe an action that the speaker wants another person to do: &quot;Duok pinigų!&quot; – Give me some money! &quot;Iš pradžių įleiskime svečius.&quot; – Let us at first invite the guests in. This mood is actively used in modern Lithuanian.

The 2nd person of singular has its ending -i only in poetry / fictional literature. The usage of this ending is usually an indication of poetic style.

The perfect and inchoative forms are composed of the auxiliary verb būti in its simple imperative form and of an active participle of the main verb, matched according to gender and number of the person:

Imperative perfect means an instruction of the speaker that has to be completed before some other event: &quot;Pirmadienį jau būkite apsisprendę&quot; – Please already have your decision made by Monday. This form is actively used in modern Lithuanian.

Imperative inchoative means an instruction of the speaker that has to be started before some other event and continued afterwards: &quot;Kai grįšiu, būkite bedirbą&quot; – When I&#x27;ll come back, please be working. This form is obsolete.

==== Conditional mood ====

The conditional mood has three forms or tenses (simple, perfect and inchoative). It is very regular to form:

*Remove the infinitive suffix -ti (the stress pattern is always the same as the infinitive).
*Add the respective suffix and ending.

:*1The longer form with the ending -ei is used very rarely in modern Lithuanian.

:*2In modern colloquial speech the shorter forms actually retain the -mė- syllable, but remove the final -e (except for reflexive verbs): dirbtumėm, skaitytumėt.

:*3A shorter form without -mė- does exist, but is used very rarely.

This mood is actively used in modern Lithuanian and one of its functions corresponds to the English conditional mood. The conditional mood is used to describe a hypothetical action that could take place if certain conditions were met (hence the name) or a desired action in present or in future: &quot;Panaikinus muitus, sumažėtų prekių kainos&quot; – Having eliminated customs duties, prices would go down. Conditional mood is used in conditional (&quot;if&quot;) sentences; this usage requires conditional mood in subordinate and main clauses if both actions are perceived as hypothetical: &quot;Visi laimėtų, jeigu priimtumėte šį pasiūlymą.&quot; – There would be a win-win situation for everyone if you accepted this offer.

Another very important function of conditional mood is the expression of purpose in final clauses (corresponds to Subjunctive mood in English): &quot;Dirbu viršvalandžius, kad uždirbčiau daugiau.&quot; – I work extra hours so that I earn more.

The third function of conditional mood is the expression of politeness: &quot;Siūlyčiau panagrinėti šią temą kitu kampu.&quot; – I would like to suggest to examine this topic from a different angle.

The perfect and inchoative forms are composed of the auxiliary verb būti in its simple conditional form and of an active participle of the main verb, matched according to gender and number of the person:

Conditional perfect is actively used in modern Lithuanian. It means a hypothetical action in the past that would have taken place if certain conditions had been met (corresponds to the semantically equivalent form in English): &quot;Vadovas būtų pritaręs renginiui, bet niekas nerodė iniciatyvos.&quot; – The leader would have approved the event, but nobody showed initiative.

Inchoative conditional means an action that could have started in the past and continued until present if certain conditions were met: &quot;Jei jis būtų paklaũsęs mano patarimo, šiandien būtų besimáudąs turtuose.&quot; – If he had listened to my advice, today he would be rolling in money. This form is obsolete.

===Passive voice===

In Lithuanian, passive voice is always analytical and structured differently from the active voice. Passive voice has no perfect tense and no inchoative aspect, because similar semantic relationships can be expressed by the present or past passive participle dichotomy.

Passive voice is always composed of the auxiliary verb būti in its respective tense or person and either a present passive participle or a past passive participle that must match the gender and number of the subject. Sometimes the necessity participle can be used as well. In order to avoid redundancy, the following table only includes the masculine third person, singular.

:*1This form for all persons can expressed using the passive (invariable) neuter gender participle bū́ta instead of the active participle bùvęs, usually for intransitive verbs: &quot;Prieš tai mes buvome [buvę] apsilankę muziejuje → Prieš tai mūsų būta apsilankyta muziejuje.&quot; – Before that we had gone to a museum → Before that it had been gone by us to a museum. This structure is rarely used in modern Lithuanian.

The subject of the active voice is converted to the passive voice using its possessive genitive form (hence aš, tu (I, you) converts not into manęs, tavęs, but mano, tavo): &quot;Vaikus pagimdei tu, bet užauginau aš → Vaikai buvo tavo pagimdyti, bet mano užauginti.&quot; – You gave birth to the children, but I raised them → The children were given birth by you, but raised by me. The possessive adjectives are indeclinable.

Passive voice structures with present participle are the passive equivalents of active voice simple tenses: &quot;Mokslininkai atranda tolimas planetas → Tolimos planetos yra mokslininkų atrandamos&quot; – Scientists discover distant planets → Distant planets are being discovered by scientists. &quot;Kaime bijodavo vilkų → Kaime būdavo bijoma vilkų&quot; – Village [people] used to fear wolves → Wolves used to be feared by village [people].

Passive voice structures with past participle are the passive equivalents of active voice perfect tenses: &quot;Siuntinį paštas bus pristatęs iki Kalėdų → Siuntys bus pašto pristatytas iki Kalėdų&quot; – The post office will have delivered the parcel until Christmas → The parcel will have been delivered by the post office until Christmas. &quot;Už tokį poelgį tave būtų pagerbę → Už tokį poelgį būtum pagerbtas&quot; – One would have praised you for such a behaviour → You would have been praised for such a behaviour.

Because of the flexibility offered by the neuter gender, in Lithuanian most active voice structures can be converted into passive voice, including intransitive, reflexive and even impersonal verbs. A transitive example (some or most of the English translations are literal, do not make sense in English and are shown only to give an idea):

*&quot;Tinginys valgo duoną → Duona yra tinginio valgoma&quot; – A lazy one is eating bread → Bread is being eaten by a lazy one.
*An intransitive example: &quot;Vaikai smagiai pažais ir nueis miegoti → Vaikų bus smagiai pažaista ir nueita miegoti&quot; – Children will play pleasantly and then go to sleep → It we be played pleasantly and then gone to sleep by children.
*A reflexive example: &quot;Šeimos pykdavosi dėl menkniekių → Šeimose būdavo pykstamasi dėl menkniekių&quot; – The families used to quarrel for nothing → It used to be quarrelled in the families for nothing.
*An impersonal example: &quot;Po vakarykštės audros daug prilijo → Po vakarykštės audros daug prilyta&quot; – There is a lot of rain water after yesterday&#x27;s storm – It has been a lot of rain water after yesterday&#x27;s storm.

Generally in modern Lithuanian absence of the subject has a very limited use (except for impersonal verbs). In cases where an active voice structure would have no subject or there is no need for it (except for impersonal verbs), a passive voice equivalent is used instead: &quot;Čia nerūko! → Čia nerūkoma!&quot; – [Nobody] smokes here! → No smoking here! (The subject would be too broad). &quot;Skubiai išnuomoja dviejų kambarių butą. → Skubiai išnuomojamas dviejų kambarių butas.&quot; [Someone] is urgently renting a two-room apartment. → A two-room apartment is urgently for rent. (The subject is not necessary).

The opposite case is true as well. If a passive voice structure has an agent expressed in the genitive case, an active voice structure is preferred: &quot;Pilietinė visuomenė turi būti skatinama vyriausybės.&quot; → (more common) &quot;Vyriausybė turi skatinti pilietinę visuomenę.&quot; – A civil society should be promoted by the government. → The government should promote a civil society.

=== Participles ===

Lithuanian retains a rich system of participles, fourteen in total. In contrast English contains just two: the present participle (&quot;the eating cow&quot;) and the past participle (&quot;the eaten cow&quot;).

Adjectival participles decline as adjectives, while adverbial participles are not declined..

In Lithuanian participles are very important part of every type of speech. All of them have their own function, but not all are used equally often.

==== Adjectival participles ====

Adjectival participles have all the adjectival characteristics: three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), pronominal forms, mostly identical declension and sometimes even degrees of comparison. Their primary function is to describe a nominal part of speech (usually a noun), like any adjective would in their position, hence they are matched by gender, case and number with the noun they are describing.

They can be active or passive. In the following tables only nominative case forms are given.

The verb used is baĩgti (to finish).

Active (non pronominal forms):

Active (pronominal counterparts):

:*1This form only exists for verbs with prefixes (except for be-).

*One of the main functions of active participles is to describe a characteristic of a noun related to some ongoing, past or future action in which the said noun is the agent: &quot;migruojantys paukščiai&quot; – migrating birds, &quot;nepatyręs vairuotojas&quot; – inexperienced driver, &quot;pablogėsiančios darbo sąlygos&quot; – working conditions that will worsen. Only present, past simple and future active participles can fulfill this function.
*Another function of active participles is to describe a secondary action performed by the sentence subject before the main action: Atidariusi langą mergina grožėjosi tekančia saule.&quot; – Having opened the window, the girl admired the sunrise. This function is limited to the past simple participle and is one of its most common uses. If there is a need to describe a secondary action performed by the sentence subject at the same time as the main action, the &quot;pusdalyvis&quot; must be used instead (present active participle does not have this function): Atidarydama langą mergina grožėjosi tekančia saule.&quot; – While opening the window, the girl admired the sunrise. See &quot;Adverbial participles&quot; for further explanation.
*The third, a somewhat rarer, function is to explain (precise) another verb by indicating a secondary action of which the subject is the agent: &quot;Kaltinamasis prisipažįsta padaręs nusikaltimą ir labai dėl to gailisi.&quot; – The defendant confesses having committed the crime and sincerely regrets it. If the subject is not the agent expressed in the nominative case of a noun or a pronoun, an adverbial participle must be used instead.

Passive (non pronominal forms):

Passive (pronominal counterparts):

:*2This form only exists for transitive verbs with prefixes (except for be-). In Lithuanian reflexive verbs can be transitive: &quot;susipinti plaukus&quot; – to plait one&#x27;s hair [to oneself].

Passive voice present participles and the necessity participles can acquire degrees of comparison if their meaning allows it: mėgti (to like) → liked (favourite), mėgstamesnis (more liked), mėgstamiausias (most liked/favorite); būti (to be) → būtinas (necessary), būtinesnis (more necessary), būtiniausias (the most necessary).

The necessity participles are used to describe something that has to be done: Įsidėmėtinos rašybos atvejis&quot; – A spelling case one has to pay special attention to. Abejotina, ar mums pavyks&quot; – It is to be doubted if we succeed. Mostly limited to official styles, but certain participles are actively used in colloquial speech as well, some of them being considered more adjectives than verbs: &quot;Jis suimtas už pasibaisėtiną elgesį su gyvūnais&quot; – He was arrested for an appalling behaviour with animals. (Pasibaisėtinas = one that has to be detested).

Main passive participles mainly denote actions that have impact upon nouns they describe: &quot;statomas namas&quot; – a house that is being built, &quot;iškeltas klausimas&quot; – a question that has been raised, &quot;vykdysimas įsakymas&quot; – an order that will be obeyed. Future passive participles are rare in modern speech.

Present passive participles very often have an active meaning, especially if the verb is intransitive, and are one of the terminology building tools: &quot;kuliamoji mašina&quot; – a threshing machine, &quot;taupomasis bankas&quot; – a savings bank, &quot;grįžtamasis ryšys&quot; – a feedback. If the verb is transitive, it can be used in its intransitive meaning in form of a present passive participle: &quot;gydomasis vanduo&quot; – healing water. Compare: &quot;geriamasis vanduo&quot; – drinking water. The difference in those cases is only semantic (water cannot be &quot;healed&quot;, thus it is accepted that &quot;gydomasis vanduo&quot; denotes &quot;water having healing properties&quot;, but not &quot;water being healed&quot;).

==== Adverbial participles ====

As the name suggests, adverbial participles have the characteristics of an adverb and are used to describe the verb instead of the subject. There are three types of such participles: &quot;padalyvis&quot; (&quot;sub-participle&quot;), &quot;pusdalyvis&quot; (&quot;half-participle&quot;) and &quot;būdinys&quot; (&quot;descriptive participle&quot;). These forms are not conjugatable, although the &quot;pusdalyvis&quot; has feminine and masculine genders for both singular and plural. These forms do not have equivalents in English or other languages (except Latvian), the given translations of these names are &quot;ad hoc&quot;.

*The primary function of the &quot;padalyvis&quot; is to indicate an action that is happening at the same time (present &quot;padalyvis&quot;) or before (past &quot;padalyvis&quot;) the event said with the main verb, of which the sentence subject is not the agent: &quot;Lauko darbus mes dirbome saulei šviečiant (present &quot;padalyvis&quot;) – We were doing the field works the sun shining; &quot;Skaniai pavalgius malonu pamiegoti&quot; (past &quot;padalyvis&quot;) – Having eaten a delicious meal, it is pleasant to take a nap&quot;.
*The primary function of the &quot;pusdalyvis&quot; is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): &quot;Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We were doing the field works while singing. In this case the present &quot;padalyvis&quot; participle can be used as well: &quot;Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We were doing the field works while someone else was singing. A secondary action done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: &quot;Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We were doing the field works having sung. When used with the preposition &quot;prieš&quot; (&quot;before&quot;), &quot;pusdalyvis&quot; and &quot;padalyvis&quot; denote a secondary action in future: &quot;Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We were doing the field works before singing. &quot;Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant&quot;. – We were doing the field works before someone else started to sing.

This table shows the participle usage in temporal adverbial phrases:

*Another function of the &quot;padalyvis&quot; is to explain (precise) another verb by indicating a secondary action of which the subject is not the agent: &quot;Vartydamas seną albumą, prisiminiau mus šiame ežere maudydavusis&quot; – While seeing an old photo album, I remembered us having used to swim in this lake. If the subject &quot;is the agent&quot;, an adjectival participle must be used instead.

This table shows the participle usage as an object.:

*The &quot;būdinys&quot; (the descriptive or intensifying participle) reinforces the meaning of the verb being described: &quot;Šaukte šaukiausi pagalbos, niekas neatsiliepė&quot; – I was shouting loudly for help, nobody answered. Type I &quot;būdinys&quot; is used relatively often in some written and colloquial speech. Type II &quot;būdinys&quot; is very rare and can only be found in literary language. Their primary function is the same. In some grammars they are not considered verbs, but adverbs derived from verbs.

=== Grammatical aspect ===

All Lithuanian verbs can be characterized by their aspect which can be either perfective or imperfective. Nevertheless, this important dichotomy is semantical, rather than expressed by purely grammatical means. Formally distinguishing an imperfective verb from its perfective counterpart is not possible, since those forms are not mutually exclusive or interdependent. Moreover, certain grammatical categories (like past iterative tense) automatically negate any perfectiveness a certain verb might have in infinitive or in other tenses. The opposite is true as well: a different tense (like an inchoative or perfect tense) of an otherwise imperfective verb automatically grants a perfective meaning. Contrary to modern Slavonic languages, each and every Lithuanian verb, in spite of its aspect, has all tenses and forms described in previous chapters of this article.

Nevertheless, certain very general rules can be laid down to detect the aspect of a verb in Lithuanian.

The imperfective aspect of a verb means the continuity of an action or a repetitiveness of a completed action. The imperfective aspect can sometimes be implied by:

*The absence of a prefix for certain verbs: dìrbti – to be working, šaũkti – to be shouting, krìsti – to be falling.
*The presence of a suffix (except for &quot;-er(ė)ti&quot;, &quot;-el(ė)ti&quot;) combined with the absence of a prefix for certain verbs: maldáuti – to be begging, mė́tyti – to be throwing [multiple times], šokinė́ti – to be jumping [constantly, multiple times].
*The impossibility for certain verbs to be used without a prefix: užgaulióti – to be bullying, pãsakoti – to be telling a story.
*The complete or partial change of meaning for certain prefixed verbs: priklausýti – to be in possession (from klausýti – to listen), pakę̃sti – to tolerate (from kę̃sti – to suffer), atsidúoti – to be stinking (from dúoti – to give).
*For some prefixed verbs that merely indicate the ability to do something: panèšti – to be able to carry, nusėdė́ti – to be able to sit.

The perfective aspect of a verb means the completeness of an action. The perfective aspect can sometimes be implied by:

*The presence of a prefix for certain verbs: padìrbti – to work for a certain amount of time, pašaũkti – to call, nukrìsti – to fall. There are very few perfective prefixed verbs that would distinguish themselves from their imperfective unprefixed counterparts only by their perfective meaning, since any prefix almost always has a semantical nuance.
*The presence of the suffix &quot;-er(ė)ti&quot; or &quot;-el(ė)ti&quot;: dìrsterėti – to take a glimpse, kúoktelėti – to become insane.

In other cases the aspect is contextual. This might sometimes be implied by:

*The absence of a suffix and a prefix for certain verbs:

:– mèsti – to throw:

::&quot;Vakar mečiau darbą&quot; – I quit my job yesterday. (perfective)

::&quot;Visas senas knygas jis metė į šiukšlių dėžę&quot; – He was throwing all the old books to the trash bin. (imperfective)

:– grį̃žti – to come back:

::&quot;Grįžęs namo, virtuvėje rasi sriubos.&quot; – Having come back home, you&#x27;ll find some soup in the kitchen. (perfective)

::&quot;Grįžtu namo, kol saulė dar nenusileido&quot; – I&#x27;m going home as the sun is not yet down. (imperfective)

*A specific tense in some other cases:

:– laimė́ti – to win:

::&quot;Kol kas mūsų komanda laimi&quot; – For the meantime our team is winning. (present tense, imperfective)

::&quot;mūsų komanda laimėjo dideliu skirtumu&quot; – Our team [has] won by a big difference. (past simple tense, perfective)

=== Verb prefixes ===

==== General usage notes ====
Prefixes are added to verbs to make new verbs that have different color of the primary verb&#x27;s meaning. The new verb and the primary verb are considered different words, taking different positions in vocabularies. However their meanings are related, often showing similarity to being forms of a single verb. In many instances a prefixed verb has no apparent semantical relationship with the primary verb. Prefixes have mostly restrictive sense, so they restrict the meaning of the primary not prefixed verb to certain direction, amount or limit of time.

* ap- round (direction, perfective), about, around
* &quot;api-&quot; is a variant of &quot;ap-&quot; before &quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot;
* at- off; from, from somewhere (direction; place, perfective); at (with &#x27;moving towards&#x27; verbs)
* &quot;ati-&quot; is a variant of &quot;at-&quot; before &quot;d&quot; or &quot;t&quot;
* į- in (direction, perfective), into, be able to (imperfective)
* iš- out (direction, perfective), ex-
* nu- away (direction), from the start place (action with some direction, perfective); down
* pa- sub-, under (direction, perfective); definite, terminating on continuous (&lt; after), a bit, slightly, some time (time or amount, imperfective), till end (for single actions, cf &quot;su-&quot;, time or amount, perfective)
** ima - &#x27;it takes&#x27;
** pa-ima - &#x27;it takes and finishes it&#x27;
** ėmė - &#x27;it was taking&#x27;, &#x27;it has been taking&#x27;, &#x27;it had been taking&#x27;
** pa-ėmė - &#x27;it took&#x27;
*par- back, similar to English (Latin) &quot;re-&quot; (with some differences; perfective)
* per- through (place, perfective), over, across, thoroughly, completely (perfective)
* pra- by (direction, perfective), through, between, starting (time, perfective rarely)
* pri- up, to (direction or place, perfective), close to, to the place (of the action) (place, perfective), much, many (amount, sometimes perfective)
* su- together (place, perfective), from everywhere (direction), till end (time, perfective), completely (long or complex action, perfective)
* už- on (direction or place), completely (short action, cf. &quot;su-&quot;, perfective)
* už- behind (direction, perfective), in (for limited time, cf &quot;į-&quot;) (direction and time, perfective), suddenly, unexpectedly (time, perfective)

There are also three special modifying prefixes that can be used with other prefixed or unprefixed (including reflexive) verbs. They define different forms of the same verb, rather than a new verb:

*&quot;ne-&quot; is a prefix that makes negative form of a verb: turiù – I have, neturiù – I haven&#x27;t.
*&quot;be-&quot; says that an action of a verb:

:– takes an undefined amount of time: &quot;Šitaip bedirbant galima susigadinti sveikatą&quot; – Working [for a long time] like that one can damage one&#x27;s health. This function allows &quot;be-&quot; to be used as a dummy prefix for reflexive present tense participles. In that case the reflexive formant moves right after the prefix, thus avoiding the formation of a complex reflexive ending: &quot;džiaũgtis&quot; – to rejoice → &quot;džiaũgiantisis&quot; – the one (, nominative) who rejoices, but more commonly: &quot;besidžiaũgiantis&quot;. Other forms besides nominative (&quot;džiaũgiančiasis&quot; – the ones (, accusative) who rejoice) are not used at all in favour of &quot;besidžiaũgiančias&quot; etc.

:– may be interrupted (see &quot;Inchoative tenses&quot;);

:– is restrictive (a combination of English &quot;only&quot; and &quot;still&quot;): &quot;Ligoninėje jį motina beaplanko&quot; – Only his mother still visits him to the hospital.

*&quot;te-&quot; indicates:

:– that an action of a verb is restrictive (equivalent of English &quot;only&quot;): &quot;Ligoninėje jį motina teaplanko&quot; – Only his mother visits him to the hospital;

:– the 3rd person of the imperative mood (see &quot;Imperative mood&quot;).

*&quot;tebe-&quot; indicates that an action of a verb is still ongoing (equivalent of English &quot;still&quot;): &quot;Ligoninėje jį motina tebeaplanko&quot; – His mother still visits him to the hospital.
*&quot;nebe-&quot; indicates that an action of a verb is no longer ongoing (equivalent of English &quot;no longer&quot;): &quot;Ligoninėje jo motina nebeaplanko&quot; – His mother no longer visits him to the hospital.
* A verb cannot acquire more than one prefix, except for &quot;ne-&quot;, &quot;te-&quot;, &quot;be-&quot;, &quot;nebe-&quot; or &quot;tebe-&quot;. Only very few words are exception from this.
* The indicator of reflexion &quot;-si&quot; is used between the prefix and the root if the verb is prefixed, e. g. 
&lt;poem&gt;
 &quot;nẽšasi&quot; but &quot;nusìneša&quot;, &quot;atsìneša&quot;
 &quot;laikýtis&quot; but &quot;susilaikýti&quot;, &quot;pasilaikýti&quot;
 &quot;teiráutis&quot; but &quot;pasiteiráuti&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
*The same rule is applied, when &quot;ne-&quot;, &quot;be-&quot;, &quot;nebe-&quot;, &quot;te-&quot; or &quot;tebe-&quot; is added:
&lt;poem&gt;
 &quot;nẽšasi&quot; but &quot;nesìneša&quot;, &quot;nebesìneša&quot;, also &quot;nenusìneša&quot;, &quot;neatsìneša&quot;, &quot;tebeatsìneša&quot;
 &quot;laikýtis&quot;, but &quot;nesilaikýti&quot;, also &quot;nesusilaikýti&quot;, &quot;nepasilaikýti&quot;
 &quot;teiráutis&quot; but &quot;nesiteiráuti&quot;, also &quot;nepasiteiráuti&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

==== Stress retraction ====

Certain Lithuanian verbs have the ability to move their stress to the last prefixed element they acquire. General stress retraction principles are laid down below.

All prefixes (including &quot;ne-&quot; type, but not including the prefix &quot;per-&quot;) acquire the stress only in:

*past simple tense forms of primary (monosyllabic stem) verbs. This always happens when the 3rd person has an &quot;-ė&quot; ending, its stress would normally fall on its penultimate syllable and this syllable has a short vowel or a rising tone:

:&quot;baũsti&quot; (to punish, monosyllabic stem verb) → &quot;baũdė&quot; (stress on the penultimate, rising tone) → nùbaudė&quot;, nebenùbaudė&quot; etc.
:&quot;vìrti&quot; (to boil, monosyllabic stem verb) → &quot;vìrė&quot; (stress on the penultimate, short vowel) → &quot;ìšvirė&quot;, &quot;nebeišsìvirė&quot; etc.
:&quot;kláusti&quot; (to ask, monosyllabic stem verb) → &quot;kláusė&quot; (stress on the penultimate, falling tone, the rule does not apply) → &quot;pakláusė&quot;
:&quot;darýti&quot; (to ask, suffixal verb, the rule does not apply) → &quot;dãrė&quot; (stress on the penultimate, rising tone) → &quot;padãrė&quot;

*Some present tense forms (primary or mixed stem), but only if the stress of the 3rd person falls on its penultimate syllable, this syllable is not a suffix and has a short vowel or a rising tone:

:&quot;kalbė́ti&quot; (to speak, suffixal verb) → &quot;kal̃ba&quot; (stress on the penultimate, no suffix, rising tone) → sùkalba&quot;, tebesìkalba&quot; etc.
:&quot;sukti&quot; (to turn, primary verb) → &quot;sùka&quot; (stress on the penultimate, no suffix, short vowel) → pàsuka&quot;, nèsuka&quot; etc.

*Past simple accent retraction is regular, present tense accent retraction is sporadic. If a particular verb retracts its accent in one tense, it does not mean that the other tense will follow suit.
*The accent retraction does not depend on a particular prefix (except for &quot;per-&quot;) and will systematically happen with every other prefixed structure (a prefix, a &quot;ne-&quot; type prefix or a reflexive formant). It means that even if dictionaries never include &quot;ne-&quot; type prefixes, the stress retraction can be deduced from other prefixed forms that dictionaries do include:

:&quot;plaũkti&quot; (to swim) → &quot;išplaũkti&quot; (to swim out) → &quot;išplaũkia&quot; (no retraction, hence: &quot;neišplaũkia&quot;, &quot;teišplaũkia&quot; etc.)
:&quot;riñkti&quot; (to gather) → &quot;suriñkti&quot; (to gather them all) → &quot;sùrenka&quot; (retraction does happen, hence: &quot;nèrenka&quot;, &quot;tèrenka&quot; etc.)

*The latter rule has two exceptions:

:&quot;turė́ti&quot; (to have) → &quot;suturė́ti&quot; (to restrain) → &quot;sùturi&quot; (retraction does happen, but not for &quot;ne-&quot; type prefixes of the non-prefixed verbs: &quot;netùri&quot;, &quot;tetùri&quot; etc.)
:&quot;galė́ti&quot; (to be able) → &quot;išgalė́ti&quot; (to afford) → &quot;ìšgali&quot; (retraction does happen, but not for &quot;ne-&quot; type prefixes of the non-prefixed verbs: &quot;negãli&quot;, &quot;begãli&quot; etc.)

*The prefix &quot;pér-&quot; always has the falling tone and takes the stress in all parts of speech of that word, ignoring all the other accentuation rules: &quot;pérduoti&quot; – to transmit, &quot;nebepérsivalgymas&quot; – the inability to overeat.

=== Stem classes ===
The below given tables are not a full collection of types of conjugation, there can be types in language not included here.

Consonants d, t become s before t in any case in language. In verbs this occurs before a desinence -ti of the infinitive, desinence with -t- of the past passive participle.

== Syntax ==

=== Word order ===

Lithuanian has an SVO (subject–verb–object) as the main word order:

:Adjunct(s)(temporal, locative, causal) + Subject + Adjunct(s)(other) + Verb + Object(s) + Infinitive + other parts.

At the same time Lithuanian as a highly declined language is often considered to have the free word order. This idea is partially true, and a sentence such as &quot;Today I saw a beautiful girl at the movies&quot; could be said or written in many ways:
:Aš mačiau gražią mergaitę kine šiandien.
:Šiandien aš mačiau gražią mergaitę kine.
:Gražią mergaitę mačiau aš kine šiandien.
:Gražią mergaitę aš šiandien mačiau kine.
:Kine šiandien aš mačiau gražią mergaitę.
:Kine gražią mergaitę aš mačiau šiandien.

However, word order isn&#x27;t a subject of intonation only. Different word orders often have different meanings in Lithuanian. There are also some strict rules and some tendencies in using different word placing. For example, a word that provides new information (rheme, or comment) has a tendency to be postponed after other words, but not always to the end of the sentence. Adjectives precede nouns like they do in English, but order of adjectives in an adjective group is different from English. If the main word order is followed, a temporal, locative or causal adjunct is put at the beginning of the sentence, while adjuncts of other types go directly before the verb and its objects (see the SVO rule above).

The word order in Lithuanian can also be described using concepts of theme and rheme. Looking from this point of view, the structure of a sentence is following:

: Initial complementary words or clauses + theme + middle words or clauses + rheme + final complementary words or clauses

The middle words or clauses are more significant words or word groups other than the theme or the rheme, but complementary words or clauses (both the initial and the final) are less significant or secondary. Local, causal or temporal adjuncts are typical parts of the initial complementary words group, while other complementary words are put in the final group. If an adjunct is more significant in a sentence, it should be put in the middle group or even used as theme or as rheme. The same is true considering any other part of sentence, but the Subject and the Verb aren&#x27;t complementary words typically, and they often serve as the theme and as the rheme respectively. Note that a sentence can lack any part of the structure, except the rheme.

=== Prepositions ===
Prepositions tell us where an object is or what direction it is going. Some cases of nouns, such as the genitive, accusative and instrumental, take prepositions. Some cases never take prepositions (such as locative and nominative). Certain prepositions are used with certain cases. Below is a list of some common prepositions used in Lithuanian.

====Used with genitive form of noun====
* iš – from, out of
* ant – on
* iki – until
* po – after, past, succeeding
* prie – near, at
* už – behind

====Used with instrumental form of noun====
* po – under
* su – with
* sulig – up to
* ties – by, over

====Used with accusative form of noun====
* į – in
* pas – to, at
* per – across, by, over, through, during, via
* pro – through, past, by
* apie – about

=== Conjunctions ===
Conjunctions are used to link together clauses in a sentence, for example &quot;I thought it would be a nice day but it was raining.&quot; Some common conjunctions in Lithuanian are:
* ir – and
* bet – but
* ar – used to start a question, but can also mean &quot;or&quot;
* jei – if
* kad – that (not the demonstrative pronoun)
* kol – until/till
* arba – or/but
* nes – because
* tačiau – however

<doc id="890637" wikidata="Q8008171" url="?curid=890637" title="William Dyke">
<text>William D. &quot;Bill&quot; Dyke (April 25, 1930March 10, 2016) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician. He was the 49th mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, from 1969 to 1973, and ran for Vice President of the United States on the American Independent Party ticket with presidential candidate Lester Maddox in the 1976 presidential election. He was also the Republican nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in the 1974 gubernatorial election. From 1996 until two months before his death, in 2016, he served as a Wisconsin circuit court judge in Iowa County, Wisconsin; he was chief judge of the 7th Judicial Administrative District from 2007 to 2013.

==Early life==
Dyke received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from DePauw University in Indiana. While completing his degree at the University of Wisconsin Law School, he hosted &quot;Circus 3&quot;, a local children&#x27;s television program on WISC-TV. He also moderated &quot;Face the State&quot;, a local political news program modeled after the nationally televised &quot;Face the Nation&quot;. The program included interviews with Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Gerald Ford, John F. Kennedy and other prominent politicians.

==Political career==
Dyke was a two-term mayor of Madison, Wisconsin from 1969 to 1973. His tenure as mayor is considered a colorful and often controversial part of Madison&#x27;s history. Dyke presided over Madison during the most turbulent era in the city&#x27;s history, highlighted by the Sterling Hall bombing and subsequent clashes with student uprisings. One of those student activists, Paul Soglin, defeated Dyke&#x27;s attempt for re-election in 1973. Undeterred, Dyke ran as the Republican nominee for governor in 1974, losing to Democrat Patrick Lucey.

A conservative Republican, Dyke briefly left the party in 1976 to join Lester Maddox&#x27;s American Independent Party presidential ticket as the vice presidential nominee; however, he disavowed Maddox&#x27;s segregationist views. Maddox and Dyke won 170,274 votes in the general election (or 0.21% of votes).

==Post-political career==
Following the end of his political career, Dyke opened a general contracting business in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, and bred horses. He also worked as a family mediation lawyer in Mineral Point, Wisconsin.

On December 3, 1996, Governor Tommy Thompson appointed Dyke to the circuit court vacancy in Iowa County, created by the impending retirement of Judge James P. Fiedler. He was elected to a full term on the court in 1998 and subsequently re-elected in 2004 and 2010. He later was selected as the chief judge of the 7th Judicial Administrative District by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and served the maximum of three two-year terms in that role. Dyke left the bench in January 2016, and died of pancreatic cancer in a Dodgeville, Wisconsin, nursing home two months later.

Dyke illustrated the children&#x27;s book &quot;The General&#x27;s Hat, or Why the Bell Tower Stopped Working&quot;, a tale written by Kay Price about two mice who get on the same ship with General Ulysses S. Grant on his travels to Galena, Illinois.

<text>Thomas Jefferson Anderson (November 10, 1910 – August 30, 2002) was an American author, journalist, and farmer. He was the American Independent Party vice presidential nominee under John G. Schmitz in 1972 and the American Party presidential nominee in 1976.

==Early life==
Thomas Jefferson Anderson was born in Nashville, Tennessee; the second of five children of William Joseph and Nancy Lou Anderson. After graduating from Baylor School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Anderson attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1934. At Vanderbilt he excelled in athletics, earning varsity letters as a member of both the varsity tennis and track teams. He was business editor of the school&#x27;s yearbook, &quot;The Commodore&quot;, and served on the student newspaper staff. Anderson was elected president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Theta.

In 1936, he married the former Carolyn Montague Jennings of Franklin, Tennessee. Miss Jennings, also a graduate of Vanderbilt University, was elected &quot;Miss Vanderbilt&quot; during her senior year.

After graduation, he sold securities for several Nashville-based brokerage firms, including J. C. Bradford &amp; Company, and also worked as an ad-salesman for the &quot;Southern Agriculturist&quot;. He was a veteran of World War II, having served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy.

==Publishing==
In 1947, Anderson purchased &quot;The Arkansas Farmer&quot;, the first of sixteen regional farm magazines he acquired and operated as part of Nashville-based Southern Unit Publications, Inc. Additionally, he became publisher and editor of &quot;The Farm and Ranch Magazine&quot;, a nationally circulated monthly publication based in Dallas, Texas. Anderson was the supervising editor and author of the column &quot;Straight Talk&quot; which appeared in the magazines and was reprinted in more than 375 newspapers. In 1957, a series of the columns was reprinted in a book, also titled &quot;Straight Talk&quot;. He later produced a weekly radio program of the same name. He spent much of his life as a speaker, publisher and writer, crusading for conservative causes. He won numerous patriotic awards including the Liberty Award of the Congress of Freedom and the Freedom Award of Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania..

==Political involvement==
In 1972, he was the American Independent Party vice presidential nominee, appearing on the ticket with U.S. Representative John G. Schmitz, a former Republican from California. The duo finished third in the popular vote with 1,100,868 votes.

In 1976, he was the American Party&#x27;s presidential nominee on a ticket with Rufus Shackleford.  They finished sixth in the general election with 158,724 votes.  The campaign received its best results in Virginia, where Anderson-Shackleford received 16,686 votes.  The ticket also finished third in three states: Kentucky, North Dakota and Indiana.

In 1978, Anderson ran as the American Party-endorsed candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee, but victory went to Republican Howard Baker, Jr. who won his third and final term in the chamber.  He appeared on the ballot as an independent due to state law, which requires a minimal number of signatures to appear as an independent but requires a full party petition consisting of tens of thousands of signatures to appear on the ballot with a party label.  Anderson received 45,908 votes.

==Later life==
Anderson remained active in conservative politics and was widely popular as a speaker, appearing on various TV and radio programs and delivering more than 1,500 speeches between 1947 and 1994. He lived his later years in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Blowing Rock, North Carolina.

He was known for a great sense of humor: in some circles he was called &quot;a modern-day Will Rogers,&quot; in others &quot;the barefoot wit of the John Birch Society.&quot; One of his most famous aphorisms was &quot;Politicians are like cockroaches: It&#x27;s not what they steal and carry away; it&#x27;s what they fall into and mess up.&quot; A colleague of Anderson&#x27;s wrote: &quot;Tom Anderson is not a common man. He is of the uncommon stock that conceived and created this republic. He is deeply devoted to the principles proclaimed in the U.S. Constitution. Tom Anderson is unaffected, practical and poetic. If you want style and daring with the kick of a Tennessee mule, then Thomas Jefferson Anderson is your man. A smile. A grin. An earnest patriot. A shot of adrenalin in sluggish patriot veins. By example of his life as well as by his word, Tom Anderson has made a permanent contribution to the literature and liberty under law.&quot;

Anderson liked to tell the following story &quot;A farmer was being plagued by a group of wild hogs. He decided to capture them one by one. He built a corral in the woods leaving an opening for an enclousure. Next he put corn in front of the corral. At first none of the hogs showed any interest. Finally some of the young ones begin to go up and smell it and then run back to the herd. Finally one on them took an ear of corn and ran back and ate it. Slowly the other hogs did the same. Each day the farmer put the corn a little closer to the corral with the same results by the hogs. At last he placed the corn inside the corral. As they were inside eating he gradually completed the enclousure, board by board, and the hogs didn&#x27;t even notice because they were inside eating the free corn. Finally he finished the gate and locked it. The hogs tried to get out, but he had &#x27;em. FELLOW HOGS, WE&#x27;VE BEEN FENCED.&quot; .

Anderson was a past president of the American Agricultural Editors Association. He and his wife were two of thirteen charter members of St. Paul&#x27;s Southern Methodist Church in Nashville.

Anderson died on August 30, 2002, in Raleigh, North Carolina. He is interred at the Mount Hope Cemetery in Franklin, in Williamson County, Tennessee.

<text>CIII-DT (channel 41) is a television station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, serving as the flagship station of the Global Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Corus Entertainment, CIII-DT maintains studios at 81 Barber Greene Road (near Leslie Street) in the Don Mills district of Toronto, and its transmitter is located atop the CN Tower in downtown Toronto.

The station reaches much of the population of Ontario through a network of 12 transmitters across primarily the southern and central portions of the province (as a result, it is the &quot;de facto&quot; Global outlet for the capital city of Ottawa through repeater CIII-DT-6). Since August 29, 2022, CIII-DT serves as the master control hub for all 15 Global owned-and-operated stations across Canada.

==History==
Ken Soble, the founder of CHCH-TV in Hamilton, envisioned a national &quot;superstation&quot; of 96 satellite-fed transmitters with CHCH as its flagship. In 1966, he filed the first application with the Board of Broadcast Governors for a network to be branded as NTV—however, the application faced various regulatory hurdles and underwent numerous revisions over the next number of years. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) eventually decided to go ahead with the publicly owned Anik satellite system instead of relying on private communications companies to build Canada&#x27;s satellite broadcasting infrastructure, placing the NTV application in jeopardy after Power Corporation of Canada, a key investor in the plan, backed out.

In 1970, one of Soble&#x27;s former employees, Al Bruner, teamed up with Peter Hill to revive the application under new ownership. Bruner and Hill&#x27;s group, Global Communications, scaled back the original NTV proposal to a network of seven UHF transmitters in Southern Ontario, whose combined footprint would have provided at least secondary broadcast coverage from Montreal to Detroit. Global Communications still aspired to eventually build out Soble&#x27;s original 97-station network, and viewed the seven-transmitter Ontario chain as an interim step. However, since CHCH was no longer involved in the application, Global&#x27;s iteration of the plan also required the launch of a new station to serve as its flagship.

The station first signed on the air on January 6, 1974, as CKGN-TV (before its use by the station, the CKGN callsign had previously been used by what is now CTV owned-and-operated station CKNY-TV in North Bay from 1955 to 1962). It branded itself as the &quot;Global Television Network,&quot; a name which reflected its then-unprecedented coverage of most of Southern Ontario from six transmitters (a seventh that would have reached Montreal was turned down) fed from a centralized studio. From its launch in 1974 until 2009, the station&#x27;s main transmitter was licensed to Paris, a small town near Brantford, but Toronto became the station&#x27;s primary city of licence following an amendment to the channel 41 licence in 2009. Through its entire history, however, the station&#x27;s main studio facility has been based in a converted factory (built 1954 for Barber Greene Canada Limited) in the Don Mills area of North York (since 1998, located in Toronto).

It had hoped to be distinct from CBC and CTV by airing a number of its own Canadian-made programs. Three months later, however, many of these programs had been cancelled due to deep financial problems. It had made a serious blunder by signing on in the middle of the 1973–74 television season, and prospective advertisers did not have the money to spare for commercial spots. It barely registered as a blip in the ratings; in Toronto, for instance, it only drew a 2.5 share, just a fraction of those drawn by CBC and CTV. Its line of credit was yanked, and it was unable to meet daily expenses.

Amid losses of over a million dollars a month, the network was bailed out by two conglomerates in March 1974 – a Toronto-based group headed by Allan Slaight and a Winnipeg-based group headed by Izzy Asper and Paul Morton. By the fall, Global was forced to scrap its ambitious business model just to survive. Instead, it began airing as much non-Canadian content as allowed (at the time, Canadian content regulations required stations to broadcast domestically produced programs for 60% of its overall schedule, and 50% during prime time), becoming essentially a clone of CTV.

Asper&#x27;s group bought controlling interest in 1977, making them first western owners of a major Canadian broadcaster. In 1989, Asper and Morton tried to buy out each other&#x27;s shares, and the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba ended the contest by ordering a sale of shares by auction, which allowed Asper and his company, Canwest, to take full ownership.
The station&#x27;s callsign was changed to CIII-TV in January 1984, in accordance with its 10th anniversary of broadcasting. The Windsor/Cottam transmitter would be an exception to the rebroadcasters that were also assigned the CIII calls that month for a few years as it continued to be identified in CRTC documents as CKGN-TV-1, perhaps because of licensing issues with nearby broadcasters in the Detroit market (the CKGN calls are now used by an FM radio station in Kapuskasing, Ontario).

Shaw Media purchased the station from Canwest Global in 2010 and Corus, in turn, acquired CIII from Shaw Media in 2016.

==News operation==
CIII-DT presently broadcasts 30 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). In addition to its main news department in Toronto, the station also operates a news bureau at the National Press Centre in Ottawa. CIII does not employ its own sports reporters; sports news content was formerly provided by sports specialty channel Sportsnet 360.

Early on, its flagship news program &quot;Global News&quot; was developed under the guidance of Bill Cunningham, a veteran of CBC News; in the beginning, the newscast was anchored by Peter Trueman in Toronto and Peter Desbarats in Ottawa. During the news department&#x27;s early years, its newscasts were one of the most successful and important programs that CKGN/CIII had. Trueman has noted in his memoir that the programme was groundbreaking: &quot;Our newsroom-studio combination ... served as a model for the new CHAN-TV facilities in Vancouver, and it is currently [1979] the inspiration for Ted Turner&#x27;s new Cablenews operation in Atlanta&quot;. The CBC also looked to it for inspiration when it changed its national news format in the early 1980s. The programme also pioneered the use of &quot;regional correspondents,&quot; usually print or radio journalists, who would regularly advise the station about stories in their part of Ontario. This allowed field producers and a Global crew to target key stories of the day. &quot;This is the main reason that much of Global&#x27;s ex-urban coverage has been so effective&quot;, Trueman wrote in 1979.

During the 1980s, Global greatly expanded its news operation, with a 90-minute block of news starting at 5:30 p.m., as well as newscasts at noon and 11 p.m. By the end of the 1980s, the noon newscast was simply titled &quot;News at Noon&quot;, the 5:30 newscast was called &quot;First News&quot;, the 6 p.m. newscast was called &quot;The Six O&#x27;Clock Report&quot;, and the 11 p.m. newscast was titled &quot;The World Tonight&quot;. Trueman left CIII in 1988. Other anchors on the station over the years have included Mike Anscombe, Beverly Thomson, John Dawe, Jane Gilbert, Peter Kent, Loretta Sullivan, Bob McAdorey, Thalia Assuras and Anne-Marie Mediwake.

From 1994 to 2001, CIII also produced &quot;First National&quot;, which was anchored by Peter Kent and aired at 6:30 p.m. weeknights. In 2001, the program was replaced by &quot;Canada Tonight&quot;, which in turn was replaced that fall with &quot;Global National&quot;, anchored by Kevin Newman; it originated from CHAN&#x27;s facility in Vancouver before moving to a dedicated studio in Ottawa in February 2008. In January 2009, CIII canceled its weekday morning newscast &quot;Global News Morning&quot;, along with the &quot;Noon News Hour&quot;, with the former being discontinued due to low ratings and both programs being dropped due to cost-cutting measures at certain Global stations. From February to August 2009, CIII simulcast former Hamilton sister station CHCH-TV&#x27;s &quot;Morning Live&quot; newscast each weekday from 7 to 9 a.m. The CHCH simulcast was later dropped after Canwest sold that station to Channel Zero, with CIII airing second-run lifestyle programming in the morning timeslot, as well as rebroadcasts of the previous night&#x27;s &quot;News Hour Final&quot;.

On October 11, 2011, CIII-DT launched a three-hour weekday morning newscast titled &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, running from 6 to 9 a.m., which broadcasts from a storefront studio at Shaw Media&#x27;s Bloor Street building in Downtown Toronto. The station also moved its early evening newscast, &quot;News Hour&quot;, a half-hour earlier to 5:30 p.m. to coincide with a shift of &quot;Global National&quot; to the 6:30 p.m. slot, joining Montreal&#x27;s CKMI-DT and Halifax&#x27;s CIHF-DT as the only Global stations to carry the network&#x27;s national newscast in that timeslot.

On August 27, 2012, CIII restored a midday newscast to its schedule with the launch of a half-hour weekday noon newscast. Unlike the existing lunch hour newscasts carried on Global&#x27;s sister stations, the newscast airs for 30 minutes instead of one hour. The expansions to CIII&#x27;s news programming were part of a benefits package that was included as a condition of the sale of the Global Television Network to Shaw Communications.

In June 2016, Global News announced that &quot;The Morning Show&quot; co-host Liza Fromer would not have her contract renewed after five years with the station. Fromer was the only original host of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; remaining from when the show launched in 2011. No replacement was hired to fill her position. Another layoff was with &quot;Global News at Noon&quot; anchor Rosey Edeh. Neither anchor works with the station anymore.

=== Former local news programs===
*&quot;The Morning Show&quot; – airing from 6–9:30 a.m. ET weekdays. The show is hosted by Carolyn Mackenzie, Jeff McArthur and Liem Vu at a studio at Corus Quay. Carolyn Mackenzie anchored local news, Jeff McArthur anchored national news, and Liem Vu reported on social media news and weather. Jeff McArthur&#x27;s national news segment is also aired on Global News Morning shows on Global Halifax, Montreal, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, and Regina. The 9–9:30 portion of the show is also aired nationally after local &quot;Global News Morning&quot; programs, however the run-time has since been extended to one hour. The national one-hour show kept &quot;The Morning Show&quot; branding, while it was dropped locally.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CIII-TV-41 in Toronto began broadcasting its digital signal in July 2009. The station&#x27;s analogue signal, over UHF channel 41, was shut down on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. CIII&#x27;s digital signal was relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 65, as its original digital channel was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to UHF channel 41.

Global also transitioned CIII-TV in Paris, CIII-TV-6 in Ottawa and CIII-TV-7 in Midland (serving Barrie) to digital on August 31, 2011. CIII-TV-22 in Stevenson (serving Windsor and Chatham) converted to digital on August 8, 2011. The transmitter operates at a reduced power and its coverage area has been reduced. CIII-TV-55 in Fort Erie vacated its channel frequency on August 31, 2011, as Global decided to shut down that transmitter. Coverage to the areas in Canada served by the Fort Erie transmitter are provided by CIII-DT-41. Global plans on transitioning its remaining transmitters to digital by 2016, though all of CIII-DT&#x27;s transmitters except for its Bancroft transmitter are to be converted to digital by February 2013.

Shortly after the 2011 digital transition, an additional digital subchannel (41.2) was launched, carrying a standard definition feed of CIII-DT, which fully duplicated the existing programming on 41.1. However (unlike other Toronto-area stations), this SD feed was not simply a letterboxed or cropped version of the HD feed, instead having different placement for promotional graphics and a separate on-screen bug (without an &quot;HD&quot; annotation). It is therefore possible that the SD feed needed to be broadcast over-the-air in order to continue carriage of this dedicated feed on cable and satellite providers (however, it also served as a benefit to some over-the-air viewers with 4:3 television sets and digital converters, insofar as it allowed those viewers to avoid older 4:3 programs appearing both letterboxed &quot;and&quot; pillarboxed). In late spring 2018, CIII-DT ceased broadcasting digital subchannel 41.2.

On April 10, 2012, Shaw Media applied for permission to change CIII-DT-6&#x27;s allocation from VHF channel 6 to UHF channel 14, switching from circular to elliptical polarization, citing the VHF-Low band&#x27;s impulse noise (compared to the VHF-High and UHF bands) causing reception issues, which would be mostly resolved with a higher frequency. The power would be increased substantially, from 3.3 kW, to 145 kW. The application states that it may be short-spaced to Buffalo, New York&#x27;s WUTV, and Plattsburgh, New York&#x27;s WPTZ, both of which may be subject to (and cause) some co-channel interference on the fringes of CIII-DT-6&#x27;s service area. This application was approved by the CRTC on July 4, 2012. CIII-DT-6 officially moved to channel 14 in mid-August 2013.

Shaw Media had begun applying for permission to convert its transmitters in Northern Ontario to digital, with CFGC-TV in Sudbury and CFGC-TV-2 in North Bay on June 14, and CIII-TV-12 in Sault Ste. Marie on June 22. The application for CIII-TV-12 included switching its digital allotment from VHF channel 7 to UHF channel 15, for improved signal quality and a slightly increased population coverage. The application for CFGC-DT-2 requested the use of UHF channel 15, instead of UHF channel 32, as CHCH-TV-6 currently uses that frequency. The digital channel for CFGC-TV has not yet been requested. All three transmitters are to be fed via satellite.

Following the shutdown of the Radio-Canada repeater in Kitchener (CBLFT-TV-8) which had been assigned the UHF channel 17 allocation, Shaw had applied on October 10, 2012, to move its CIII-DT digital transmitter in Paris from VHF channel 6 to UHF channel 17, to vastly improve its coverage to the Kitchener area. Technical parameters included in the change would be a boost in power and slight decrease in height (4 kW at 311.3 meters on VHF channel 6, compared to 165 kW (average of 97 kW) at 272 meters on UHF channel 17). The UHF signal would have a slightly smaller range of broadcast coverage, but Shaw had admitted that areas on the fringes would still be able to receive Global programming via CIII-DT-29, CIII-DT-41 and CIII-TV-4. The application was approved by the CRTC on January 22, 2013. CIII-DT-27 Peterborough/Cobourg could on most days be seen from as far away as Rochester, New York, on channel 27.1. 

In January 2020, the transmitter power of CIII-TV-2 (Bancroft) was temporarily reduced to prevent an overload caused by high VSWR at the site. On December 4, 2020, the CRTC approved a request from Corus Entertainment to shut down CIII-DT-27 and CIII-TV-2 (among other Global retransmitters) in favour of multiplexing CIII-DT-27 via CHEX-DT and CIII-TV-2 via CKWS-DT Kingston. This decision saw the CRTC abandon a promise made in 2010 to have the owners of Global Television transition CIII-TV-2 to digital. CIII-TV-2 continued to operate as an NTSC analogue retransmitter until August 31, 2022. The CIII-TV-2 transmitter that operated out of Vennachar for close to 50 years was possibly the last over the air analogue transmitter to rebroadcast Global in Ontario. It is unclear what Industry Canada will now use VHF channel 11, the spectrum that had been allocated for CIII-TV-2 digital, for. Despite gaining approval to close CIII-DT-27, it remains on air.

===Transmitters===

A series of rebroadcast transmitters relay the CIII signal to much of Ontario. Most of these use the CIII base callsign followed by a number to denote their status as rebroadcasters, except in Sudbury and North Bay where the CFGC callsign is assigned. The most likely explanation for using CFGC is that the close resemblance between the number 1 and the letter I would make CIII-TV-11 an undesirable call sign for Sudbury, while North Bay could not use CIII-TV-2 as that call sign is already in use in Bancroft.

These six transmitters formed the original 1974 service:
* CKGN-TV channel 6 from Paris (serving Hamilton, Brantford and Kitchener–Waterloo)
* CKGN-TV-1 channel 22 from Cottam (near Windsor; also serving Detroit, Michigan)
* CKGN-TV-2 channel 2 from Bancroft (serving Belleville)
* CKGN-TV-6 channel 6 from Gatineau, Quebec (Camp Fortune site, near Ottawa)
* CKGN-TV-22 channel 22 from Uxbridge (near Toronto)
* CKGN-TV-29 channel 29 from Oil Springs (near Sarnia)

Original plans called for a seventh transmitter, CKGN-TV-36 from Maxville, near Cornwall. It would have primarily served Hawkesbury, but would have also provided a fairly strong grade B signal to Montreal. However, Global was forced to drop the Maxville transmitter from its proposal due to a CRTC moratorium on new stations in Montreal.

The Cottam transmitter was beset by legal difficulties. Since it served Windsor, it was considered to be part of the Detroit market, in which Global did not hold the rights for all of its programming. While Global initially was able to supply alternate programming to the Cottam site, its initial financial difficulties prompted it to instead begin showing a slide during preempted shows, which often made up significant portions of the network&#x27;s prime time lineup. The network quoted the cost of continuing to provide alternate programming to Windsor at $800,000 a year. At the same time, in an attempt to disclaim competition with American outlets, Global ceased sending listings to Detroit&#x27;s newspapers.

On August 29, 1977, the Cottam transmitter suffered an electrical fire that caused $300,000 in damage and took it out of commission. After considering restoring service from Cottam and finding issues with securing an appropriate transmitter and its insurance claim, the network began to contemplate ways of improving its service to Windsor. Further delays were incurred when concerns arose about potential polychlorinated biphenyl contamination of the site. In 1981, Global sought permission to build a higher-power successor to the Cottam station for the Windsor–Detroit market; the CRTC denied this application in December of that year.

In 1986, the CRTC approved the relocation of the Cottam transmitter to Stevenson. Some time after this, the callsign CIII-TV-22 from the now-defunct Uxbridge transmitter were reassigned to the Stevenson transmitter, which then was activated in November 1988. The transmitter is located southwest of Wheatley, between Wheatley and Leamington, but its signal is aimed northeast (towards Chatham–Kent), and barely reaches Windsor and Detroit – presumably to protect the Detroit stations. In the early 1990s, additional transmitters were added to expand Global&#x27;s footprint in Ontario.

The Uxbridge transmitter was Canada&#x27;s most powerful UHF transmitter, operating at the maximum allowable power of 5 megawatts. It shut down in 1988, replaced by CIII-TV-41, broadcasting from the CN Tower in Toronto. For all intents and purposes, given that the station has always been based in Toronto, this was CIII&#x27;s main transmitter and Global&#x27;s flagship even before the station officially moved its licence to Toronto in 2009. This was the case with the Uxbridge transmitter as well. Starting in 2008, CIII began sending its signal to the Toronto transmitter first, since the Paris transmitter did not yet have digital capability.

Other transmitters were gradually introduced, including (launch dates in parentheses):
* CIII-TV-7 channel 7 from Midland (November 1987, serving Barrie)
* CIII-TV-4 channel 4 from Owen Sound (June 1988)
* CIII-TV-27 channel 27 from Peterborough (October 1988)
* CFGC-TV channel 11 from Sudbury (December 1992)
* CFGC-TV-2 channel 2 from North Bay (December 1992)
* CIII-TV-13 channel 13 from Timmins (December 1992)
* CIII-TV-12 channel 12 from Sault Ste. Marie (December 1992)
* CIII-TV-55 channel 55 from Fort Erie (early 1993, serving Niagara Falls and the southern Niagara Region; signal also reaches Buffalo, New York)

On August 28, 1996, Global was given CRTC approval to add a new transmitter at Cornwall. Global had proposed to use VHF channel 11 at Cornwall but instead channel 11 was awarded to Hamilton&#x27;s CHCH-TV in Ottawa that same day. Another option was to operate a Global transmitter on a UHF channel in Cornwall which was never launched.

CIII is not available in Thunder Bay but the market is served by independently owned affiliate CHFD-DT, owned by Dougall Media. CHFD&#x27;s owners, the Dougall family, were concerned about Global threatening their local television monopoly (Dougall Media controls all of the local network television output for the Thunder Bay region and had previously lobbied the CRTC to cease CHCH-TV&#x27;s cable transmissions in the mid-1990s) and pressured the CRTC to deny Global&#x27;s application to build a transmitter there. However, in 2009, Dougall Media switched the affiliation of CHFD from CTV to Global. As a result, Global-branded programming is available in Thunder Bay, just not via CIII&#x27;s province-wide network of repeaters. Similarly, in Kenora, former CTV affiliate, CJBN-TV (which was owned by Shaw), switched to full-time Global programming in late 2011 (the station would cease operations in January 2017).

Initial attempts to cover Peterborough and Kingston from the Bancroft transmitter had yielded poor to marginal results; this signal has since been largely supplanted (for Peterborough only) by the more-powerful CIII-TV-27. Despite CHEX-DT becoming Global&#x27;s Peterborough station in 2018, CIII-DT-27 remains on the air.

CIII-TV-41, along with CHCH in Hamilton and CHAN-TV in Vancouver, began over-the-air high-definition broadcasts in 2008.

<text>Charles Wesley Bennett (November 21, 1854 – February 24, 1927) was an American professional baseball player from 1875 or 1876 through the 1893 season. He played 15 years in Major League Baseball, principally as a catcher, with the Milwaukee Grays (49 games, 1878), Worcester Ruby Legs (51 games, 1880), Detroit Wolverines (625 games, 1881–1888) and Boston Beaneaters (337 games, 1889–1893). He played on four pennant-winning teams, one in Detroit and three in Boston, and is one of only two players (the other being Ned Hanlon) to play with the Detroit Wolverines during all eight seasons of the club&#x27;s existence.

Bennett compiled a .256 batting average and a .340 on-base percentage during his major league career with 549 runs scored, 203 doubles, 67 triples, 55 home runs and 533 runs batted in (RBIs). His greatest value, however, was as one of the greatest defensive players of his era. Between 1880 and 1891, he ranked among the National League leaders 10 times in Defensive Wins Above Replacement (Defensive WAR) at all positions and led the league&#x27;s catchers seven times in fielding percentage and three times in double plays and putouts.

Bennett&#x27;s baseball career ended in January 1894 when he lost both legs in a train accident in Kansas. In 1896, Detroit&#x27;s new baseball stadium was named Bennett Park in his honor. The Detroit Tigers played their home games at Bennett Park from 1896 through the 1911 season. Bennett has also been credited with inventing the first chest protector, an improvised cork-lined vest that he wore under his uniform.

==Early years==
Bennett was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1854. His father, Silas Bennett (1815–1887), was a native of Connecticut. His mother, Catherine (Nichols) Bennett, was a native of Pennsylvania. Charlie was the eighth of their 11 children.

==Professional baseball player==

===Neshannock===
Bennett began his career in organized baseball as the catcher for the Neshannock team in the Pennsylvania League. Sources are in conflict as to how long Bennett played for Neshannock, one account indicating he was on the Neshannocks&#x27; &quot;pay roll for two seasons&quot;, and others stating that he played for the Neshannocks in 1874, 1875 and 1876. Bennett was described while playing for the Neshannocks as a hard hitter who &quot;nearly broke the directors of the club because of the number of balls knocked into the Shenango river.&quot; While playing for Neshannock, Bennett was the catcher for Cal Hawk, one of the pitching stars of the early 1870s.

===Detroit Aetnas===
At the end of the 1876 season, at age 22, Bennett signed with the Detroit Aetnas. The Aetnas were originally an amateur baseball team, but the club signed several professional players at the end of the 1876 season to aid in a rivalry with the Cass Club of Detroit. The professional players signed by the Aetnas included three members of the Neshannock team—Bennett, George Creamer and Ned Williamson. Bennett&#x27;s first appearance for the Aetnas was on September 21, 1876, against the Boston Red Stockings at the Woodward Avenue grounds in Detroit. Bennett played third base in the game and, in the first inning, hit a &quot;hot one&quot; that glanced off the pitcher and continued into center field for a triple that drove in a run. The Aetnas&#x27; professional players, including Bennett, remained until the end of the season and were &quot;stranded&quot; in Detroit &quot;without a dollar&quot;, until a &quot;benefit was given and enough money realized to pay their way home.&quot;

===Milwaukee Grays===
Some sources state that Bennett signed with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1877 and played in one game for that team. He ultimately signed a contract to play in 1877 for the Milwaukee club at a salary of $150 per month. During Bennett&#x27;s first season with Milwaukee, the team was part of the League Alliance, which has been classified as a minor league. The following year, the Milwaukee club was admitted to the National League and became the Milwaukee Grays. Bennett made his major league debut on May 1, 1878, and appeared in 49 games, 35 as a catcher and 20 in the outfield. He compiled a .245 batting average for the Grays with 16 runs scored and 12 RBIs. His battery-mate, Sam Weaver lost 31 games that season.

===Worcester Ruby Legs===

In 1879, after the Milwaukee club disbanded, Bennett joined the Worcester Ruby Legs, a team organized and managed by Frank Bancroft. The team played in the National Association, which has been rated as having been a minor league in 1879. Bennett began at Worcester as a backup catcher to Doc Bushong, but eventually replaced Bushong. Bennett hit .328 in 42 games during the 1879 season.

During the winter of 1879–1880, Bancroft took his team, including Bennett, on a baseball tour of Cuba and the Southern United States. Bennett stayed in New Orleans and played for local baseball teams there until the 1880 season began.

In 1880, Worcester was admitted to the National League, replacing the Syracuse Stars, and attaining major league status. That season, Bennett appeared in 51 games, 45 of them as the team&#x27;s catcher. Bennett caught for Lee Richmond, baseball&#x27;s first left-handed pitching star. Richmond compiled a 32–32 record in 1880, and also pitched the first perfect game in major league history, with Bennett catching. Bennett had a .228 batting average with 20 runs scored and 18 RBIs during the 1880 season. Defensively, he ranked second among the National League&#x27;s catchers with a .913 fielding percentage and fifth in putouts and range factor.

===Detroit Wolverines===
At the end of the 1880 season, Bancroft, who had been Bennett&#x27;s manager in Worcester, signed as the manager of a new Detroit baseball club that was admitted to play in the National League starting in 1881. Bancroft brought several Worcester players with him, including Bennett, George Wood, and Lon Knight. Bennett played eight seasons with the Detroit Wolverines. He was one of only two players, the other being Ned Hanlon, to play for the Wolverines during every season that the franchise existed.

In his first season with Detroit, Bennett established himself as one of the best players in the National League. With a .301 batting average and a .478 slugging percentage, Bennett&#x27;s overall Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating of 4.2 was the second highest among all of the league&#x27;s position players, trailing only Cap Anson (5.8 WAR). He also finished among the league leaders with seven home runs (2nd), 64 RBIs (2nd), .478 slugging percentage (4th), and 32 extra base hits (4th). Bennett also excelled defensively in 1881, leading the league&#x27;s catchers in putouts (418) and range factor (7.19), compiling the second highest Defensive WAR rating in the league, and setting a major league record for catchers with a .962 fielding percentage (.962). With his strong performance on both offense and defense, Bennett helped lead the Wolverines to a respectable 41–43 record in the first season of the franchise&#x27;s existence. According to baseball historian Peter Morris, Bennett took the first recorded &quot;curtain call&quot; in baseball during the 1881 season. After hitting a home run in May 1881, Bennett was &quot;loudly applauded, and the crowd would not desist until he bowed in acknowledgment.&quot;

In 1882, Bennett had another strong season, batting .301 and compiling a 4.1 WAR rating that ranked sixth in the league among position players. He also ranked among the league leaders with a .450 slugging percentage (6th), 10 triples (10th), and five home runs (4th). Defensively, he led the league&#x27;s catchers with 446 putouts and a 7.94 range factor. Bennett was the Wolverines&#x27; dominant offensive player, and helped the team to its first winning record at 42–41.

In 1883, Bennett hit for a career high .305 batting average, and his 4.9 WAR rating was the third highest among the National League&#x27;s position players, trailing only Dan Brouthers and Jack Farrell. Bennett&#x27;s defensive performance as dominant as his offense, with a 1.8 Defensive WAR rating that was the highest among catchers and the third highest among all players in the league. He also led the league&#x27;s catchers with 11 double plays turned and a .944 fielding percentage. As good as Bennett was in 1883, the Wolverines team was not good, dropping to seventh place with a 40–58 record.

In 1884, matters got worse for the Wolverines, as they finished in last place with a 28–84 record. Bennett&#x27;s batting average fell to .264, but his on-base percentage remained high at .334, and his WAR rating remained strong at 4.1. Bennett later recalled the toll of multiple losing seasons in Detroit: &quot;During the next four years [1882–1885] I wished many times I was out of Detroit, or, rather, out of that team. It was awful. I thought sometimes we were lucky to finish last. Once we lost twenty-five straight games. Every week I caught a new pitcher.&quot;

In June 1885, the Wolverines added another slugger in Sam Thompson, and the team improved incrementally to sixth place with a 41–67 record. Bennett compiled a 4.5 WAR rating for the season, the second highest of his career and fifth highest among the league&#x27;s position players. He was also among the league leaders with 42 extra base hits (4th), 47 bases on balls (5th), a .456 slugging percentage (6th), 24 doubles (6th), a .356 on-base percentage (7th), and 64 RBIs (10th). Defensively, he led the league&#x27;s catchers with a 7.00 range factor and ranked second in double plays (10), fielding percentage (.919) and putouts (347).

In 1886, the Wolverines added several star players and improved substantially, finishing in second place with an 85–38 record. Bennett put in another solid year for the Wolverines with a .371 on-base percentage and a 3.9 WAR rating. He also compiled perhaps his best defensive season with a 2.0 Defensive WAR rating that was the highest among all players in the National League. He also led the league&#x27;s catchers in fielding percentage (.955), double plays (13), and putouts (425), and ranked second in range factor (7.38).

The 1887 season was the pinnacle in the history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team won the National League pennant with a 79–45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. Bennett&#x27;s WAR rating of 1.7 was the lowest during his time in Detroit, but still a respectable showing. Even though he was limited by injury to 46 games during the regular season, Bennett still finished with the sixth highest Defensive WAR rating among all players in the league and compiled a .363 on-base percentage. In his only World Series, Bennett had nine RBIs, 11 hits, and a triple, stole five bases, and scored six runs.

During the 1887 season, an excursion of fans from Bennett&#x27;s hometown in Pennsylvania traveled to watch Bennett play in Detroit who enjoyed watching him receive a wheel barrow loaded with 500 silver dollars when the Wolverines returned to Detroit to celebrate their 1887 world championship victory. Bennett then wheeled the barrow around the field &quot;to the delight of 5000 people.&quot;

During the 1888 season, Bennett rebounded with one of the best seasons of his career. His overall 4.2 WAR rating was the third highest of Bennett&#x27;s career, and his 2.2 Defensive WAR rating was the highest of his career and the second highest in the National League. Despite being the eighth oldest player in the league, he broke his own major league record with a .966 fielding percentage. The Wolverines as a whole finished in fifth place with a 68–63 record. With high salaries owed to the team&#x27;s star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. On October 16, 1888, the Wolverines sold Bennett, Dan Brouthers, Charlie Ganzel, Hardy Richardson and Deacon White to the Boston Beaneaters for a price estimated at $30,000.

===Chest protector===
Bennett has been credited with inventing the first chest protector worn by catchers. According to Bennett, his wife worried about his safety as &quot;a target for the speed merchants&quot; and saw a need for a form of body armor to protect her husband from broken ribs. Bennett and his wife designed a homemade shield by sewing thick strips of cork between layers of &quot;heavy bedticking material&quot;. Out of a concern for spectators &quot;roasting him for being chicken-hearted&quot;, he wore the device under his shirt.

===Durability as a catcher===
During Bennett&#x27;s era, catchers lacked the protective equipment present in 20th-century baseball. It was not until 1888 that specialized catcher&#x27;s mitts began to be used on the non-throwing hand. As a result, catchers&#x27; hands, fingers, legs, and bodies took a beating in Bennett&#x27;s time. For this reason, catchers in the era were not every-day players, needing time to recuperate after catching a game. When Bennett began his major league career, the major league record for games caught in a season was 63 games.

Most catchers of the 1870s and 1880s minimized wear and tear on their hands by playing some games at other positions. For example, the three &quot;catchers&quot; from the era who have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame each played less than half of their games as a catcher: (1) Buck Ewing, often cited as the greatest catcher of the 19th century, played only 636 of his 1,345 games (47%) as a catcher; (2) King Kelly played only 583 of his 1,455 games (40%) at catcher; and (3) Deacon White eventually moved to third base as his regular position, finishing his career with only 458 of 1,622 games (28%) as a catcher. Bennett, on the other hand, played 954 of his 1,084 games (88%) at the catcher position.

Bennett&#x27;s durability came not from avoiding injuries, but from playing through them. When he broke another finger during the 1887 World Series, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported:It did not seem anything unusual to Bennett or his fingers. ... When he held up that battered right hand, with its fingers swollen and spread like a boxing glove, with rags tied around three of them, and a general appearance of having been run over by a freight-car about the entire hand, it did not seem as though there were room to split it in any new place.

Accounts of Bennett&#x27;s mangled or gnarled hands and fingers are common. In his book, &quot;Catcher: The Evolution of an American Folk Hero&quot;, Peter Morris cited one such account:Bennett &#x27;declared that only a sissy would use a padded glove with the fingers and thumb cut off. During one of the games in which he figured a foul ball split the left thumb of Bennett&#x27;s hand from the tip right down to the palm. The flesh was laid open right to the bone. A doctor who examined it immediately told Bennett that it would be necessary for him to quit the game until such time as the thumb healed sufficiently. The physician pointed out ... that blood poisoning might set in which would cause him the loss not only of the thumb but perhaps a hand or an arm. But despite all the doctor&#x27;s caution Bennett remained in the game catching day after day with his horribly mangled finger. He kept a bottle of antiseptic and a wad of cotton batting on the bench and between innings would devote his time to washing out the wound.&#x27;

Another account arises out of the 1889 pennant race. That year, Bennett played for the Boston Beaneaters in a close pennant race with the New York Giants. Bennett&#x27;s hands had taken a beating while catching for John Clarkson, who won 49 games and pitched five games a week during the season. On the last day of the season, Boston had to win, and New York had to lose for Boston to finish in first place. By the sixth inning, second baseman Hardy Richardson told the manager, Jim Hart, that the ball was coming to him in a bloody state due to the condition of Bennett&#x27;s hands. Bennett did not want to come out of the game, but Hart removed him over Bennett&#x27;s protest, and Bennett &quot;had to keep his hands in plasters for two weeks.&quot;

Despite the physical battering and breaking every finger on both hands, Bennett was able to continue catching for 20 years (1874–1893). His total of 954 major league games at catcher stood as the record until 1897.

===Boston Beaneaters===

After a brief dispute with the Boston management with respect to his salary, Bennett signed a contract with the club In January 1889. That year, Bennett appeared in 82 games, all at catcher. His batting average dropped to .231, his lowest tally since he was a part-time player in 1880. However, he continued to show his value defensively. Despite being the sixth oldest player in the National League, Bennett finished fifth among all players at all positions with a Defensive WAR of 1.4. He also led the league&#x27;s catchers with a .955 fielding percentage, ranked second among the league&#x27;s catchers with 419 putouts and third with nine double plays turned. With Bennett&#x27;s assistance, Boston pitcher John Clarkson compiled a 49–19 record, and the Beaneaters finished second in the league with an 83–45 record.

In 1890, Bennett remained with the Beaneaters even though he had in 1886 joined the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players&#x27; League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. As a member of the Brotherhood, his refusal to play in the Players&#x27; League was criticized by many of his fellow Brotherhood members. Hardy Richardson, a Brotherhood representative and former teammate of Bennett, stated that Bennett offered to sign with the Brotherhood only if he was given a three-year contract guaranteed by two responsible men. Some reports indicated that former Detroit manager Robert Leadley was paid $1,000 to convince Bennett to remain with the Beaneaters and that Bennett was himself paid a substantial signing bonus. Bennett later described his ambivalence about the Players&#x27; League: &quot;I was a Brotherhood man from the first. Mrs. Bennett was strongly opposed to my going into it and before the season opened I told my friends that I could not join them, so I remained with the Boston Club. When I went into the Brotherhood it was a protective order and I had no idea that they intended organizing an association of their own.&quot;

Bennett became the catcher for Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, Kid Nichols, in 1890, as Nichols compiled a 27–19 record while Clarkson went 26–18. The team finished in fifth place with a 76–57 record. Offensively, Bennett&#x27;s production continued to decline, as he finished the 1890 season with a .214 batting average. Though he had only 60 hits, he also drew 72 bases on balls, boosting his on-base percentage to .377. Already the third oldest player in the league, Bennett nevertheless also continued to rank among the best defensive catchers. He led the league&#x27;s catchers with a .959 fielding percentage and ranked fourth in putouts and double plays and fifth in assists and runners caught stealing.

In 1891, Bennett appeared in 75 games, all as a catcher, for a Boston team that won the National League pennant with an 87–51 record. The team had two 30-game winners, as John Clarkson won 33 and Kid Nichols won 30. Bennett&#x27;s batting average remained low at .215, but his .332 on-base percentage was significantly higher. Moreover, he led the National League in fielding percentage by a catcher for the seventh time in his career. He also led the league with 10 double plays turned by a catcher.

In 1892, King Kelly took over as the Beaneaters&#x27; number one catcher. In a backup role, Bennett, at age 37, appeared in 35 games as Boston&#x27;s catcher. The team continued to play well, winning its second consecutive National League pennant with a 102–48 record.

In 1893, Bennett returned to his role as the team&#x27;s number one catcher, appearing in 60 games at the position. In that role, he helped Boston win its third consecutive National League pennant with an 86–43 record. Bennett compiled a .209 batting average and .352 on-base percentage and appeared in what proved to be his final baseball game on September 30, 1893.

===Train accident===

While playing for Boston, Bennett returned each year to his home in Detroit for the off-season, and also traveled with his dog to Williamsburg, Kansas, for extended hunting trips. In 1894, Bennett was joined on his annual hunting trip by pitcher John Clarkson. On January 10, 1894, Bennett&#x27;s legs were crushed by a Santa Fe Railroad passenger train in Wellsville, Kansas, while traveling from Kansas City to Williamsburg.

Bennett stepped off the train to talk to an old friend who lived in Kansas and whom Bennett had arranged to greet when the train stopped at Wellsville. It was raining, and the platform was wet. When the train started moving, Bennett &quot;swung around to catch the railing&quot;, but his foot slipped, and his left foot went over the rail. Bennett pushed his right leg against the rail to push himself back, but it also slipped and went over the track. The train&#x27;s wheels ran over his left foot and right leg at the knee.

That evening, doctors at the North Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa, Kansas, amputated Bennett&#x27;s left leg just above the ankle and his right leg just above the knee. In June 1894, he was fitted with artificial limbs, but his baseball career was over. In August 1894, a benefit to raise money for Bennett was held at Boston&#x27;s South End Grounds; the event included a baseball game between the Boston team and a team of collegiate players as well as foot races and other attractions. The boxing champion Gentleman Jim Corbett attended and briefly played in left field with the Boston team. The benefit was attended by nearly 9,000 people and raised $6,000 for Bennett. Bennett walked to home plate during the event, aided by crutches and artificial limbs, and bowed to the crowd &quot;until the grounds fairly shook with cheers.&quot;

===Catching records and legacy===
During his 15 years in the major leagues, Bennett set numerous fielding records. Several of those records are set forth below.
* Fielding percentage. In 1882, Bennett set a major league record with a .962 fielding percentage as a catcher. He broke his own major league record in 1888 with a .966 fielding percentage. Bennett&#x27;s career fielding percentage of .942 stood until 1896 as the major league career record. Bennett also led all major league catchers in fielding percentage six times; no other catcher has accomplished this feat more than four times.
* Putouts. In 1886, Bennett set a major league, single-season record with 445 putouts by a catcher. His career total of 5,123 putouts was also a major league record that stood until 1901. 
* Double plays. In 1887, Bennett broke the career record for most double plays turned as a catcher. His final career total of 114 double plays was the major league record until 1900. 
*Games played. Bennett&#x27;s career total of 954 games at catcher stood as the major league record until 1897.

Sports writer Tim Murnane in 1894 declared Bennett &quot;unquestionably the greatest back stop the game ever produced, taking his throwing and batting into consideration ... Year after year Bennett led the catchers of the League and country until it seemed impossible to get a player to head him off. It made no difference to him who pitched the ball, he was there to catch it, and always with big hands. Who can remember Bennett dropping a pitched ball? Passed balls were a lost art when this man was behind the stick, and he was the ideal back stop. [Kid] Nichols always insisted on having him do his catching, saying that Bennett knew every batsman&#x27;s weak points, and made easy work for the pitcher.&quot;

Pitcher Lee Richmond, whose perfect game Bennett caught in 1880, later stated that, among the catchers he had worked with, &quot;my favorite was Charley Bennett, the best backstop that ever lived in the world. He went after everything, he knew no fear, he kept his pitcher from going into the air.&quot;
In &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, sports historian Bill James wrote that Bennett was perhaps the best defensive catcher of the era. In comparing Bennett to Buck Ewing, James noted: &quot;Buck Ewing was supposedly a brilliant catcher, but Bennett caught 50% more innings than Ewing, with a lot fewer mistakes: per 1000 defensive innings, Ewing was charged with 59 errors and 66 passed balls, while Bennett was charged with 46 errors and 43 passed balls.&quot; Although James ranked Ewing ahead of Bennett as an overall player, he chose Bennett as the catcher on his Gold Glove Team for the 1880s. On the offensive side, Ewing compiled a .303 career batting average, 47 points higher than Bennett. However, with Bennett&#x27;s talent for drawing walks, Ewing&#x27;s career on-base percentage (.351) was only 11 points higher than Bennett (.340).

==Family and later years==

In 1882, Bennett was married to his wife, Alice, a Vermont native. They met while Bennett was playing for Worcester. They had no children, and lived for more than 20 years at 67 Alexandria Street in Detroit, and later at 1313 Delaware Avenue in Detroit.

After his injury, Bennett operated a cigar store in Detroit. When Bennett first announced plans to open a cigar store, shortly after losing his legs, one woman wrote to him and said, &quot;If Charley Bennett opens a cigar store in Detroit, all the ladies will commence smoking.&quot;

Bennett later took lessons in china painting and became quite proficient at the decorative art, first as a hobby and then as a supplemental source of income. One writer wrote that the art of china painting was &quot;the last thing one would expect in the world from a man whose hands have been battered out of shape and whose every finger has been broken.&quot; &quot;The Sporting News&quot; wrote: &quot;It was with characteristic patience that Bennett trained his distorted fingers in the delicate art of china painting.&quot;

When a new ballpark was opened in Detroit in 1896, it was named Bennett Park in his honor. Bennett caught the first pitch at Bennett Park in 1896. It became a Detroit tradition for Bennett to catch the first pitch in Detroit, an honor that Bennett continued for every home opener through 1926.

In November 1926, Bennett underwent surgery at Grace Hospital in Detroit to remove &quot;a superorbital abscess of the face.&quot; He had been ill for several months before the surgery and never fully recovered afterward, as the poison from the abscess reportedly spread through Bennett&#x27;s system. Bennett died in February 1927 at age 72 at his home in Detroit. He was buried at Woodmere Cemetery in Detroit.

<text>Christina Hambley Brown, Lady Evans (born 21 November 1953), is an English journalist, magazine editor, columnist, broadcaster, and author. She is the former editor in chief of &quot;Tatler&quot; (1979 to 1982), &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1984 to 1992), &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (1992 to 1998), and the founding editor in chief of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; (2008 to 2013). From 1998 to 2002, Brown was chairman of Talk Media, which included &quot;Talk Magazine&quot; and Talk Miramax Books. In 2010, she founded Women in the World, a live journalism platform to elevate the voices of women globally, with summits held through 2019. Brown is author of &quot;The Diana Chronicles&quot; (2007), &quot;The Vanity Fair Diaries&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Palace Papers&quot; (2022).

As a magazine editor, she has received four George Polk Awards, five Overseas Press Club awards, and ten National Magazine Awards, and in 2007 was inducted into the Magazine Editors&#x27; Hall of Fame. In 2021, she was honored as a Library Lion by the New York Public Library. In 2022, Women in Journalism, the UK&#x27;s leading networking and training organization for journalists, honored her with their Lifetime Achievement Award.

Born in England, Brown emigrated in 1984 and became a U.S. citizen in 2005. She now holds dual British-American citizenship. In 2000, she was appointed a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) for her services to journalism overseas, by Queen Elizabeth II. In September 2022, she was a CBS commentator for the funeral of the Queen.

In 2023, in partnership with Reuters and Durham University, Brown hosted Truth Tellers, the inaugural Sir Harry Evans Global Summit in Investigative Journalism at the Royal Institute of British Architects, in honor of her late husband Sir Harold Evans, the former editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The event featured over 60 investigative journalists and editors from the U.K, the U.S, Ukraine, Mexico, Russia, Nigeria, South Africa, Canada, Iran, Bulgaria and France. Among the featured guests were Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in conversation with Emily Maitlis about What Makes a Great Investigative Journalist, Activist Bill Browder, Bellingcat investigator Christo Grozev, Head of Investigations and Chairwoman of the Board for the Anti-Corruption Foundation (founded by Alexei Navalny) Maria Pevchikh and Russian journalist and writer Mikhail Zygar on the weaponization of media in Russia, and the creator and writer of HBO show Succession Jesse Armstrong. The Truth Tellers summit will now take place annually.

==Early life and education==
Brown was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, and grew up in the village of Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. Her father, George Hambley Brown, worked in the British film industry producing the Miss Marple films starring Margaret Rutherford. Her mother, Bettina Kohr, who married George Brown in 1948, was an executive assistant to Laurence Olivier on his first two Shakespeare films. Brown&#x27;s elder brother, Christopher Hambley Brown, became a film producer.

Brown was considered &quot;an extremely subversive influence&quot; as a child, resulting in her expulsion from three boarding schools. Offenses included organizing a demonstration to protest against the school&#x27;s policy of allowing a change of underwear only three times a week, referring to her headmistress&#x27;s bosoms as &quot;unidentified flying objects&quot; in a journal entry, and writing a play about her school being blown up and a public lavatory being erected in its place.

Brown entered the University of Oxford at the age of 17. She studied at St Anne&#x27;s College, and graduated with a BA in English Literature. As an undergraduate, she wrote for &quot;Isis&quot;, the university&#x27;s literary magazine, to which she contributed interviews with the journalist Auberon Waugh and the actor Dudley Moore, and for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Her irreverent article about an invitation from Waugh to a &quot;Private Eye&quot; lunch caught the eye of &quot;New Statesman&quot; editor Anthony Howard who offered her an Oxford column.

While still at Oxford, she won &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; National Student Drama Award for her one-act play &quot;Under the Bamboo Tree,&quot; which was performed at the Bush Theatre and the Edinburgh Festival. A subsequent play, &quot;Happy Yellow&quot;, was mounted at the London fringe Bush Theatre in 1977 and was later performed at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Career==
===&quot;Punch&quot;===
After graduating from Oxford, Brown was invited to write a weekly column for the literary humor magazine &quot;Punch&quot;. These articles and her freelance contributions to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; earned her the Catherine Pakenham Award for the best journalist under 25. Some of the writings from this era formed part of her first collection &quot;Loose Talk&quot;, published by Michael Joseph.

===&quot;Tatler&quot;===
In 1979, Brown was invited to edit &quot;Tatler&quot; by its new owner, the Australian real estate millionaire Gary Bogard. During her tenure, she turned the society magazine into a successful modern glossy magazine with covers by celebrated photographers Norman Parkinson, Helmut Newton, and David Bailey, and fashion by Michael Roberts. &quot;Tatler&quot; featured writers from Brown&#x27;s circle, including Julian Barnes, Dennis Potter, Auberon Waugh, Brian Sewell, Martin Amis, Georgina Howell (whom Brown appointed deputy editor), and Nicholas Coleridge. She transformed the social coverage with pictures by her young discovery Dafydd Jones. Brown wrote content for every issue, contributing sharp surveys of the upper classes. She traveled through Scotland for a feature titled &quot;North of the Border with the Thane of Cawdor&quot; and wrote short satirical profiles of eligible London bachelors under the pen name Rosie Boot.

&quot;Tatler&quot; covered the emergence of Lady Diana Spencer, soon to become Princess of Wales. Brown joined NBC&#x27;s Tom Brokaw in running commentary for &quot;The Today Show&quot; on the royal wedding on 29 July 1981. &quot;Tatler&#x27;s&quot; circulation increased from 10,000 to 40,000. In 1982, when Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., owner of Condé Nast Publications, bought &quot;Tatler&quot;, Brown resigned to assume writing full-time writer again. She also hosted several episodes of the long-running television series Film82 for BBC1 as a guest presenter.

===&quot;Vanity Fair&quot;===
In 1983, Newhouse brought Brown to New York to advise on &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, a magazine he had resurrected earlier that year with a circulation of 200,000. She served as a contributing editor for a brief time, and was named editor in chief on 1 January 1984. Upon taking over the magazine, she found it to be &quot;pretentious, humourless. It wasn&#x27;t too clever, it was just dull.&quot;

The first contract writer she hired was movie producer Dominick Dunne, whom she met at a dinner party hosted by the writer Marie Brenner. Dunne told Brown he was going to California for the trial of his daughter&#x27;s murderer. Brown suggested he keep a diary as solace, and his resulting report (headlined &quot;Justice: A Father&#x27;s Account of the Trial of his Daugher&#x27;s Killer&quot;) proved the launch of Dunne&#x27;s long-running magazine career.

Early pieces such as Dunne&#x27;s cover story on accused murderer Claus von Bülow and Los Angeles arrivistes such as Candy Spelling, as well as the use of provocative covers, transformed the prospects of the magazine. Among others, Brown signed up Marie Brenner, Gail Sheehy—who wrote a series of widely read political profiles, including a cover story on Mikhail Gorbachev—Jesse Kornbluth, T.D. Allman, Stephen Schiff, Lynn Hirschberg, Peter J. Boyer, John Richardson, James Atlas, Alex Shoumatoff and Ben Brantley. The magazine became a mix of celebrity news and serious foreign and domestic reporting. Brown persuaded novelist William Styron to write about his depression under the title &quot;Darkness Visible&quot;, which subsequently became a best-selling nonfiction book. At the same time, Brown formed fruitful relationships with photographers Annie Leibovitz, Harry Benson, Herb Ritts, and Helmut Newton. Leibovitz&#x27;s portrayals of Jerry Hall, Diane Keaton, Whoopi Goldberg and others came to define &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Its best-known cover of this period featured a naked and pregnant Demi Moore in August 1991.

Three stories from June to October 1985 helped the magazine gain attention and circulation in a year when rumors were rife that it was to be folded into &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; Harry Benson&#x27;s cover shoot of Ronald and Nancy Reagan dancing in the White House; Helmut Newton&#x27;s portrait of accused murderer Claus von Bülow in his leathers with his mistress Andrea Reynolds with reporting by Dominick Dunne, and Brown&#x27;s own cover story on Diana, Princess of Wales in October 1985 titled &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot;.

Sales of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; rose from 200,000 to 1.2 million. In 1988, Brown was named Magazine Editor of the Year by &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine. Advertising topped 1,440 pages in 1991 and circulation revenues rose, especially from profitable single-copy sales at $20 million, selling some 55 percent of copies on the newsstand, well above the industry average sell-through rate of 42 percent. Despite this success, professor Jeffrey Pfeffer in his book &quot;Power: Why Some People Have It – And Others Don&#x27;t&quot; suggested the magazine was losing money. In a letter to the editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, Bernard Leser, president of Condé Nast USA, stated Pfeffer&#x27;s claim was &quot;absolutely false&quot; and affirmed that &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; had indeed earned &quot;a very healthy profit.&quot; Leo Scullin, an independent magazine consultant, called it a &quot;successful launch of a franchise.&quot; Under Brown&#x27;s editorship, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; won four National Magazine Awards, including a 1989 award for General Excellence.

In October 1990, two months after the first Gulf War started, Brown nixed a picture of the blond Marla Maples for the cover and replaced it with a photograph of Cher. The reason for her last-minute decision, she quipped to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;In light of the Gulf crisis, we thought a brunette was more appropriate.&quot;

===&quot;The New Yorker&quot;===

In 1992, Brown accepted the company&#x27;s invitation to become editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the fourth editor in its 73-year history, following Harold Ross, William Shawn, and Robert Gottlieb. Brown was the first woman to hold the position. Before taking over, she immersed herself in vintage &quot;New Yorker&quot;s, reading the issues produced by founding editor Ross: &quot;There was an irreverence, a lightness of touch as well as a literary voice that had been obscured in later years when the magazine became more celebrated and stuffy. ... Rekindling that DNA became my passion.&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker is a text-driven magazine and always will be, and certainly will be under my tenure,&quot; she said. Text, she added, was her &quot;first love.&quot; Anxieties that Brown might change the identity of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as a cultural institution prompted a number of resignations. George Trow, who had been with the magazine for almost three decades, accused Brown of &quot;kissing the ass of celebrity&quot; in his resignation letter. (To which Brown reportedly replied, &quot;I am distraught at your defection but since you never actually write anything I should say I am notionally distraught.&quot;) The departing Jamaica Kincaid described Brown as &quot;Stalin in high heels.&quot;

Brown, however, had the support of &quot;New Yorker&quot; stalwarts John Updike, Roger Angell, Brendan Gill, Lillian Ross, Calvin Tomkins, Janet Malcolm, Harold Brodkey and Philip Hamburger, as well as newer staffers Adam Gopnik and Nancy Franklin. During her editorship, she let 79 staffers go and engaged 50 new writers and editors, including David Remnick (whom she nominated as her successor), Malcolm Gladwell, Anthony Lane, Jane Mayer, Jeffrey Toobin, Hendrik Hertzberg, Hilton Als, Ken Auletta, Simon Schama, Lawrence Wright, John Lahr, Pamela McCarthy, and executive editor Dorothy Wickenden. Brown introduced the annual fiction issue and the holiday cartoon issue. She also collaborated with Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates to devote an issue to the theme Black in America.

Brown broke the magazine&#x27;s longstanding reluctance to treat photography seriously in 1992, when she invited Richard Avedon to be its first staff photographer. She approved controversial covers, including Edward Sorel&#x27;s October 1992 image of a punk-rock passenger sprawled in the back seat of an elegant horse-drawn carriage, which may have been Brown&#x27;s self-mocking riposte to fears that she would downgrade the magazine. A year later Valentine&#x27;s Day publication of Art Spiegelman&#x27;s cover of a Jewish man and a Black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between Blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York, garnered controversy. Brown appointed Spiegelman&#x27;s wife Francoise Mouly as the magazine&#x27;s art editor.

During Brown&#x27;s tenure, the magazine received four George Polk Awards, five Overseas Press Club Awards, and ten National Magazine Awards, including a 1995 award for General Excellence, the first in the magazine&#x27;s history. Newsstand sales rose 145 percent. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s circulation increased to 807,935 for the second half of 1997, up from 658,916 during the corresponding period in 1992. Critics maintained it was hemorrhaging money, but Newhouse remained supportive, viewing the magazine under Brown as a start-up: &quot;It was practically a new magazine. She added topicality, photography, color. She did what we would have done if we invented &quot;The&quot; &quot;New Yorker&quot; from scratch. To do all that was costly. We knew it would be.&quot; Under Brown, its economic fortunes improved every year: In 1995 losses were about $17 million, in 1996 $14 million, and in 1997 $11 million.

In 1998, Brown resigned from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; following an invitation from Harvey and Bob Weinstein of Miramax Films (then owned by The Walt Disney Company) to chair Talk Media.

Opinions of Brown&#x27;s &quot;New Yorker&quot; tenure varied:

&quot;She had to move fast. She was decisive ... went against the tradition of popular culture unfriendly to the written word. And what was she doing? She was pumping energy and life into a magazine devoted to publishing aesthetically and intellectually demanding writing. She saved &quot;The New Yorker&quot;,&quot; wrote editorial director Hendrik Hertzberg.

Writer Adam Gopnik said, &quot;The magazine will remain smarter and braver—more open to argument, and incomparably less timid—for her presence here.&quot;

&quot;I assume we can now look forward to Miramax becoming a shallow, celebrity-obsessed money loser she made &quot;The New Yorker&quot;,&quot; wrote Randy Cohen.

&quot;She is the best magazine editor alive. What more can I say?&quot; said writer Michael Kinsley.

&quot;The most important thing, I think, has been [Brown&#x27;s] effort to bring together the intellectual material and the streets,&quot; said writer Stanley Crouch. &quot;When she was in charge, despite all the complaints from the old &quot;New Yorker&quot; crowd, one got a much stronger sense of the variousness of American society than one did under the editorship of perhaps the rightfully sainted Mr. Shawn.&quot;

===&quot;Talk&quot; magazine===
In July 1998, Brown, along with Harvey and Bob Weinstein of Miramax Films and Ron Galotti, founded Talk Media to publish books, a magazine, and movies and television programs.

Talk Media formed a joint venture with Hearst Magazines for &quot;Talk&quot; magazine, a monthly compendium of news and culture, in February 1999. Brown worked with the book division&#x27;s editor in chief Jonathan Burnham and acquiring editor Susan Mercandetti. She recalled in October 2017 at the time of allegations of sexual assault being made against Harvey Weinstein: &quot;Strange contracts pre-dating us would suddenly surface, book deals with no deadline attached authored by attractive or nearly famous women.&quot;

Staff members included editors Sam Sifton, Danielle Mattoon, Jonathan Mahler and Virginia Heffernan. Jake Tapper and Tucker Carlson provided political columns. Notable articles included the first US profile of Osama bin Laden before 9/11, Tom Stoppard&#x27;s autobiographical piece about his Jewish roots that was the origin of his 2020 play &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot; and Tucker Carlson&#x27;s revealing profile of then Republican presidential candidate George W Bush.

An anticipated magazine launch party at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York City was thwarted by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly felt it was not an appropriate use of the site. The event was moved to Liberty Island, where on 2 August 1999, more than 800 political leaders, writers, and Hollywood notables, including Madonna, Salman Rushdie, Demi Moore, and George Plimpton, arrived by barge for a picnic dinner at the feet of the Statue of Liberty under thousands of Japanese lanterns and a Grucci fireworks display. An interview with Hillary Clinton in the first issue claimed that the abuse her husband suffered as a child led to his adult philandering. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that at times, &quot;&quot;Talk&quot; seemed more interested in promoting such Miramax stars as Gwyneth Paltrow than in politics.&quot;

Despite having achieved a circulation of 670,000 &quot;Talk&quot; magazine&#x27;s publication was halted in January 2002 in the wake of the advertising recession following the 9/11 attacks. It was Brown&#x27;s first very public failure, but she said she had no regrets about embarking on the project. She told Charlotte Edwardes of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2002: &quot;My reputation rests on four magazines—three great successes, one that was a great experiment. I don&#x27;t feel in any way let down. No big career doesn&#x27;t have one flame out in it and there&#x27;s nobody more boring than the undefeated.&quot;

&quot;Politico&quot; estimated that Brown had &quot;bombed through some $50 million in 2 years&quot; on the failed venture, an assessment that did not include revenue from the book division. Talk Miramax Books flourished as a boutique publishing house until it was detached from Miramax in 2005 and folded into Hyperion at Disney. Out of 42 books published during Brown&#x27;s time, 11 appeared on &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, including &quot;Leadership&quot; by Rudy Giuliani, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; by Queen Noor of Jordan, &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; by Malika Oufkir, &quot;Experience&quot; by Martin Amis and &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; by Madeleine Albright.

A $1 million contract settlement in 2002 ended Brown&#x27;s involvement in Talk Media.

===&quot;Topic A&quot;===
After Brown hosted a series of specials for CNBC, the network signed her to host a weekly Sunday evening talk show of politics and culture titled &quot;Topic A with Tina Brown&quot;, which debuted on May 4, 2003. Guests included politicians Tony Blair and Senator John McCain and celebrities such as George Clooney and Annette Bening. &quot;Topic A&quot; struggled to find an audience on Sunday nights. It averaged 75,000 viewers in 2005, about the same as &quot;The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch&quot; (79,000) and John McEnroe&#x27;s &quot;McEnroe&quot; (75,000.) Brown resigned to write &quot;The Diana Chronicles&quot;.

===Books===

Brown&#x27;s biography of Diana, Princess of Wales was published in June 2007, just before the 10th anniversary of Diana&#x27;s death. &quot;The Diana Chronicles&quot; made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for hardback nonfiction, with two weeks in the number one position.

In 2017, Brown published &quot;The Vanity Fair Diaries&quot;, culled from her eight and a half years as editor in chief of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

In 2022, Brown published a sequel to &quot;The Diana Chronicles&quot; called &quot;The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor—The Truth and the Turmoil&quot;, on the period between the deaths of the Princess of Wales and Queen Elizabeth II. It topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list and sold 250,000 copies in the U.S.

&quot;[Brown] becomes the ideal tour guide,&quot; reviewed The Wall Street Journal: &quot;witty, opinionated and adept at moving us smoothly from bedchamber to below stairs while offering side trips to the cesspits of the tabloid press, the striving world of second-tier celebrities and the threadbare lodgings of palace supernumeraries.&quot;

&quot;Some of the gossip,&quot; wrote Philip Hensher in a review for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, as in &quot;all books of this sort, is grossly implausible.&quot;

===&quot;The Daily Beast&quot;===
On 6 October 2008, Brown teamed up with Barry Diller to launch &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, an online news site. The site gained popularity after Christopher Buckley, posted a column announcing his support of Barack Obama. Other news-making pieces included Lucinda Franks&#x27;s coverage of the Bernie Madoff scandal. Regular contributors to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; have included John Avlon, former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel, former Council on Foreign Relations president emeritus Leslie Gelb, and journalist Michelle Goldberg.

&quot;The Daily Beast&quot; won the Webby Award for Best News Site in 2012 and 2013.

On 12 November 2010, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; announced they would merge operations in a joint venture to be owned equally by Sidney Harman and IAC/InterActiveCorp called the Newsweek Daily Beast Company, with Brown as editor in chief and Stephen Colvin as CEO. In December 2012, the final printed issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot; was published. A cover headline stated the magazine would change to a digital format, alongside an editorial written by Brown. The digital format was short-lived: the print edition returned after Brown&#x27;s departure.

In September 2013, while with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, Brown was accused of falsely printing stories about Amanda Lindhout, a kidnapped Canadian journalist who was abused for 15 months by her insurgent Islamist kidnappers in Somalia, including an incorrect story about an alleged Lindhout pregnancy that never took place. A resulting retraction was printed by National Public Radio in response to Brown&#x27;s comments.

On 11 September 2013, Brown announced her departure. Initial reports of her contract not being renewed were refuted in a statement issued by Barry Diller, IAC/InterActiveCorp&#x27;s executive director: &quot;If you removed the failed experiment to revive &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the story of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; is one of excellence in reporting, in design, and in digital distribution. That to me is the lede of [Brown’s] tenure.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s resignation caused speculation in the media in regard to the future of the website. Her hand-picked successor as executive editor, John Avlon, addressed the question succinctly: &quot;&quot;The Daily Beast&quot; roars on.&quot;

=== Women in the World ===
In 2010, Brown founded Women in the World, a live journalism platform, to &quot;discover and amplify the unheard voices of global women on the front lines of change.&quot;

First held at New York’s Hudson Theater, and thereafter at Lincoln Center’s David Koch Theater, Women in The World summits convened women leaders, activists and political change-makers from around the world to share their stories and offer solutions to building a better life for women and girls. Former ABC news producer Kyle Gibson was senior executive producer and managing editor of the inaugural event.

The first summit took place on 12–14 March 2010, and included appearances by Queen Rania of Jordan, Meryl Streep, Valerie Jarrett, Christine Lagarde, Hillary Clinton, Madeleine K. Albright, Nora Ephron, and Katie Couric. At the second summit, held on 10–12 March 2011, participants included Hillary Clinton, Dr. Hawa Abdi, Condoleezza Rice, Sheryl Sandberg, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Diane Von Furstenberg, Melinda Gates and Ashley Judd.

More than 2,500 ticket buyers attended the three-day summit at Lincoln Center. At subsequent summits featured guests included Angelina Jolie, Oprah Winfrey, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Leymah Gbowee, Barbra Streisand, Nancy Pelosi, Gloria Steinem, Zainab Salbi, Christiane Amanpour, Justin Trudeau, Masih Alinejad, Nikki Haley, Lynsey Addario, Cecile Richards, Priyanka Chopra, Melinda Gates, Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche, Nicholas Kristof, Ajay Banga and Anna Wintour.

In 2012, Women in the World expanded outside the United States with a summit held in São Paulo, Brazil. Between 2012 and 2019 Women in the World summits and salons were held in New Delhi, Toronto, London and Dubai, as well as Washington DC, San Antonio, Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami.

The Women in the World summits ended during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==
In 1973, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh introduced Brown&#x27;s writings to Harold Evans, editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, who was then married to Enid Parker. In 1974, Brown was given freelance assignments by Ian Jack, the paper&#x27;s features editor. When a relationship developed between Brown and Evans, Brown resigned to write for the rival &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;. Evans divorced Parker in 1978, and he and Brown married on 20 August 1981, at Grey Gardens, the East Hampton, New York, home of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; executive editor Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn. They lived together in New York City until Evans&#x27;s death on 23 September 2020. They had two children: a son, Georgie, born in 1986, and a daughter, Isabel, born in 1990. In 2024, Brown wrote that Georgie is her &quot;38-year-old on-the-spectrum son who still lives with me.&quot; Evans was knighted for his services to journalism in 2004.

<text>Talmadge&quot;Tab&quot;Smith (January 11, 1909 – August 17, 1971) was an American swing and rhythm and blues alto saxophonist. He is best remembered for the tracks &quot;Because of You&quot; and &quot;Pretend&quot;. He worked with Count Basie, the Mills Rhythm Boys and Lucky Millinder.

==Biography==
Smith was born in Kinston, North Carolina, United States. He joined his first professional band, the Carolina Stompers, in 1929. In the 1930s and 1940s, he spent several years in the bands of Lucky Millinder and Count Basie, as well as spending long periods freelancing both as a player and as an arranger. In 1944, he participated in a recording date led by Coleman Hawkins, for which he also arranged the material. After the Second World War, he led his own groups, which concentrated on rhythm and blues.

His biggest R&amp;B hit was &quot;Because of You&quot; (1940), which reached number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, and number 20 on the pop chart, in 1951. &quot;Because of You&quot; was recorded for United Records, a label for which Smith was a prolific artist until it closed in 1957. Tab Smith cut 24 singles and a 10-inch album for the label. On his United sides, Smith sometimes played tenor saxophone.

During the 1950s, Smith was a significant rival to alto saxophone-playing bandleader Earl Bostic, who recorded for King. He was also in competition with his own formative influence, Johnny Hodges, until Hodges returned to the Duke Ellington band in 1955.

His career never recovered from the closure of United Records. After brief stays at Checker and King, Smith retired from the music business in the early 1960s. He sold real estate and played piano part-time in a steakhouse.

He died in St. Louis, Missouri, in August 1971, aged 62.

<text>Mary Baldwin University (MBU, formerly Mary Baldwin College) is a private university in Staunton, Virginia, United States. It was founded in 1842 as Augusta Female Seminary. Today, Mary Baldwin University is home to the Mary Baldwin College for Women, a residential college and women&#x27;s college with a focus on liberal arts and leadership, as well as co-educational residential college for undergraduate programs within its University College structure. MBU also offers co-educational graduate degrees as well as undergraduate degree and certificate programs for working professionals and non-traditional students.

The university is the oldest institution of higher education for women in the nation affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), and it is home to the only all-female corps of cadets in the world.

== History ==
Located in Staunton, Virginia within Augusta County, the university was founded as the Augusta Female Seminary in 1842 by Rufus William Bailey. Among the first students was Mary Julia Baldwin. In 1863, Baldwin was named principal and headed the school through the Civil War, although most schools in the area had closed due to the war and economic hardship.

In 1895, the school was renamed Mary Baldwin Seminary in honor of Baldwin. In 1923, the name changed to Mary Baldwin College when the school became a four-year institution.

In 1963, Mary Baldwin became racially de-segregated, officially ending its policy of admitting only white women.

In the mid-1970s, men began to be admitted as day students and graduate students. Four decades later, in 2017, the school began accepting residential male students, albeit not without some controversy at the time.

In 1976, when Staunton Military Academy (SMA) closed, its grounds and buildings were purchased by Mary Baldwin, expanding the campus from .

In 1977, Mary Baldwin became the first college in Virginia to launch an adult degree program. Cynthia Haldenby Tyson was appointed as the eighth president in 1985. That same year, the Program for the Exceptionally Gifted (PEG) was established to allow academically gifted girls to earn bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

In 1995, the Virginia Women&#x27;s Institute for Leadership was established as the only all-female cadet corps. In 2001, the university established the Shakespeare and Performance graduate program after the American Shakespeare Center opened the Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton.

In 2003, after 18 years as president, Cynthia Haldenby Tyson retired and Pamela Fox, dean of Miami University&#x27;s School of Fine Arts, was named the ninth president.

In May 2015, the board of trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the institution to Mary Baldwin University, effective August 31, 2016, reflecting the school&#x27;s range of bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral programs.

On July 1, 2023, Jeffrey P. Stein began his tenure as Mary Baldwin University&#x27;s tenth president after two decades at Elon University.

== Academics ==
Mary Baldwin University offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Social Work degrees in more than 30 majors. Undergraduate degrees are offered through the Mary Baldwin College for Women and two co-educational programs: University College and MBU Online. The school offers graduate degrees through the College of Education (Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Education, Master of Science in Higher Education, and Master of Science in Applied Behavior Analysis), Murphy Deming College of Health Sciences (Doctor of Occupational Therapy, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Master of Science in Physician Assistant, and RN-to-BSN), and the Shakespeare and Performance program (Master of Letters and Master of Fine Arts).

Additionally, Mary Baldwin offers fast-track degrees, bachelor&#x27;s-plus-master&#x27;s-degree plans, professional school preparation and certificate programs. Community service and study-abroad opportunities are supplied through the Spencer Center for Civic and Global Engagement, which opened in 2007.

=== Institutional partnerships ===
The co-educational Master of Letters and Master of Fine Arts students in the Shakespeare and Performance program is partnered with the American Shakespeare Center, allowing the students to learn and perform in the Blackfriars Playhouse located a block away from campus.

The Heifetz International Music Institute, founded by violinist Daniel Heifetz, was moved from its Wolfeboro, New Hampshire location to Mary Baldwin University in 2012. The institute accepts applicants annually from around the world and offers summer programs for classically trained musicians.

MBU has also partnered with international organizations including the Clinton Global Initiative and Women for Women International to sponsor participants in Women for Women programs and raise awareness of human trafficking around the world.

Mary Baldwin has partnerships with several women&#x27;s colleges around the world including Doshisha Women&#x27;s College of Liberal Arts in Japan, Sungshin Women&#x27;s University in South Korea, and Lady Doak College in India.

== Virginia Women&#x27;s Institute for Leadership (VWIL) ==
Founded in 1995 by request of the Commonwealth of Virginia, VWIL (pronounced &quot;vee-will&quot;) is an all-female cadet corps and four-year program preparing participants for both military and civilian leadership through academics, fitness, military training, practical experiences and co-curricular activities. Cadets also participate in co-educational ROTC training. Commandant of the corps of cadets is Brig. Gen. Teresa &quot;Terry&quot; A. H. Djuric (USAF, Retired).

== Program for the Exceptionally Gifted ==
The Program for the Exceptionally Gifted (PEG) at Mary Baldwin University is an early entrance college program for girls who have completed 6th-10th grade and have not yet completed, or in some cases not yet started, high school. Critically, the program accepts young women between the ages of 12 and 16. Applicants of later ages are encouraged to apply for early admission instead. The program was founded in 1985 with a class of 11 students and now enrolls up to 30 new students each year. Early success of the program was greatly boosted by the women-only residential campus, which eased parental concerns, as well as exceptionally strong participation and attention by faculty in providing extra challenges and opportunities to the gifted students. Participants (&quot;PEGs&quot;) reside in a PEG-specific dorm building named for past president Cynthia Tyson, but attend classes with traditional-age students with the exception of a mandatory, PEG specific, introductory philosophy course named &quot;Knowing the Self&quot; (Phil 112). PEGs typically earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the normal four years.

== Campus ==
The MBU main campus is located in Staunton, and its Murphy Deming College of Health Sciences is located in nearby Fishersville.

The first building on Staunton campus was the Mary Baldwin University, Main Building, built in 1844. The building now houses administrative offices and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) since 1973.

== Traditions ==
MBU celebrates several annual traditions with the surrounding community. Every autumn, Mary Baldwin University commemorates Apple Day, during which students and faculty glean apples at a Virginia orchard. In recent years, the collected fruit has been distributed to area food pantries. The college also has marked Founders Day each October since 1898 to honor founders Mary Julia Baldwin and Rufus William Bailey.

The &quot;Mary Baldwin College Fight Song&quot; is sung to the tune of &quot;Blue and Gold.&quot; The song was used by Staunton Military Academy (SMA) until it closed in 1976. After Mary Baldwin purchased the SMA campus, the college began using the academy&#x27;s athletic fields, adopted the melody of the SMA fight song in 2008, and still flies SMA flags during parades. VWIL continues to hold an annual SMA reunion weekend involving a parade, banquet, and awarding of several scholarships.
