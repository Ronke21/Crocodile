<text>The fourth generation of the BMW 7 Series consists of the BMW E65 and BMW E66 luxury cars. The E65/E66 was produced from 2001 to 2008 and is often collectively referred to as the E65. The E65 replaced the E38 7 Series and was produced with petrol and turbo-diesel straight-six and V8 engines, along with a petrol V12 flagship model.

The E65 was the first BMW vehicle to include the iDrive infotainment system and the exterior styling (overseen by Chris Bangle) marked a significant departure from traditional BMW styling. Other new features included active anti-roll bars, a six-speed automatic transmission, an electronic &quot;Smart Key&quot; (dispensing with the traditional metallic key), and night vision. The 760i model also utilised the world&#x27;s first production V12 engine to use direct injection.

In late 2008, the E65 7 Series was replaced by the F01 7 Series.

== Development and launch ==
Development for the BMW E65 7 Series began in early 1996. In early 1997, Chris Bangle delivered a brief to BMW&#x27;s Munich and DesignworksUSA studios. After a competition between 20 designers, Adrian van Hooydonk&#x27;s design was approved in the spring of 1998. Production specifications were frozen in January 1999 and took 34 months from freeze to market launch. The design was patented on 16 November 2000 and development ended in early 2001.

The E65 was introduced at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 2001, and launched in Germany in November 2001. In order to produce the E65 7 Series and other future models, the BMW Dingolfing plant was retooled at a cost of approximately €500million.

== Design ==
=== Exterior styling ===

Under the direction of Chris Bangle, BMW&#x27;s Design Chief at the time, the BMW E65 7 Series saw a departure from traditional BMW exterior styling.

BMW&#x27;s board of directors were keen to move the company&#x27;s image into the future, and the initial styling sketches from 1998 by Adrian van Hooydonk were of a fastback body style - even more radical than the eventual production model. The controversial &quot;flame surfacing&quot; design greatly contrasted the conservative lines of its E38 predecessor. The rear end styling was nicknamed &quot;Bangle Butt&quot; by critics, due to the elongated rear bootlid. However, many believe that the controversial styling helped the 7 series look modern even after many years.

Dimensionally the E65 7 Series is longer, wider and taller than the E38. The wheelbase is , an increase of over the outgoing model. Despite these increased dimensions, the E65 7 Series is only heavier than the E38.

=== Interior styling ===

The E65 contained many departures from automotive interior design conventions. BMW removed the traditional console mounted gear selector, replacing it with a steering-column mounted stalk in favour of two cup holders. The e-brake is controlled using a button on the dashboard. The seat adjustment controls were moved from their traditional place on the side of the seat base to the inside of the raised central console, which drew some criticisms. Unlike most BMWs since 1975 (including the E65&#x27;s predecessor and successor), the centre instrument panel is not angled toward the driver.
== Engines ==
The V8 models were the first to use the then-new BMW N62 V8 engine, which was the world&#x27;s first engine to use a continuously variable-length intake manifold. It was also BMW&#x27;s first V8 engine to use variable valve lift (Valvetronic), replacing throttle butterflies for added response, efficiency and power. A system using traditional throttle butterflies was also present as a backup in case of faults in the valvetronic system.

=== Petrol ===
=== Diesel ===
== Transmissions ==
The E65/E66 was the first sedan to use a 6-speed automatic transmission. The specific models of transmission used for the E65 are:
* 6-speed ZF 6HP26 automatic (730d / 735i / 740i / 745i / 750i / 760i)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP19 automatic (730i)
* 6-speed ZF 6HP 32 automatic (740d / 745d)

The E65/E66 was one of the few BMWs to have a column shift lever, as opposed to a stick in the centre console.

== iDrive ==

The E65 was the first BMW to use the iDrive infotainment system. The iDrive system was built on VxWorks while the navigation system was built on the Windows CE for Automotive platform, and featured an interface primarily based around a central control knob. Many of the functions such as climate, navigation, seat heating, telephony, and car settings were incorporated into a single system allowing for centralised control. Early versions of iDrive were criticised for complicated menu structures and a steep learning curve.

The first generation of the system relied on CD media for map data. In March 2003, the maps switched to DVD format, a faster processor was used and a &#x27;Menu&#x27; and &#x27;Customisable&#x27; button were added below the control knob. In 2005, dedicated buttons were added to change radio stations or skip tracks and a brighter screen was used for the 8.8&quot; widescreen option.

== Equipment ==
The E65 was the flagship model and the most technologically advanced car produced by BMW at the time.

The following features were first introduced on the E65:
* Active anti-roll bars (active roll stabilisation) to reduce body roll when cornering. It uses a hydraulic servo in the middle of the anti-roll bar to actively counteract body roll and to reduce body roll without the traditional trade-off in ride comfort.
* Directional headlights (adaptive headlights) which electronically adjust the low-beam lights horizontally (during turns) and vertically (based on rear axle load). Also, the E65 was the first BMW available with bi-Xenon (HID) headlights.
* World&#x27;s first car with an electric parking brake. This could automatically activate in stop-and-go traffic situations and when the ignition was switched off.
* World&#x27;s first car to offer a 6-speed automatic transmission
* First BMW with DVD-based GPS automotive navigation system.
* Adaptive cruise control (ACC), however this was available in some markets on the previous generation 7 Series (E38).
* The optional automatic soft close system minimized the force required to close the doors and boot lid, and would completely close them if improperly closed.
* Two fibre-optic electronic networks: MOST Bus (media-orientated system transport) and &quot;Byteflight&quot; (safety systems bus). These busses operate at 22.5 Mbit/s and 10 Mbit/s respectively. Also, the I-bus, K-bus and P-bus were replaced by the K-CAN (Body-controller area network). This increased the system speed from 9.6 kbit/s to 100 kbit/s.

== Special models ==
=== Long-wheelbase 7 Series (E66) ===
The E66 long-wheelbase models, badged &quot;Li&quot; were introduced in June 2002. Long-wheelbase models are longer, allowing for extra rear legroom. The initial long wheelbase models were the 735Li, 745Li and 760Li. After 2003, 730Li, 730Ld, 740Li and 750Li models were added to the lineup.

=== High security 7 Series (E67) ===

The E67 high security 7 Series is an armoured variant of the BMW 7 Series. The 760Li high security was introduced at the 2003 Geneva Motor Show, with the 745Li high security model released later in September 2003.

E67 high security models are designed to withstand attacks, and meet the requirements of the B7 weapons standard. Security features include a detachable multi-layer laminated windscreen, a remote starting system, a fire extinguishing system, a fresh air system, and under-body protection. High security models also feature run flat tyres, with Michelin&#x27;s PAX system; which allows continuous driving at for approximately , with a puncture.

BMW offers a buyback service for high security models up to seven years old, which are inspected then resold to potential customers worldwide. A training course is also offered to owners and chauffeurs, and teaches car control in case of emergency situations.

=== Hydrogen 7 (E68) ===

The BMW Hydrogen 7 is a limited production hydrogen-fueled model. It uses a modified version of the 760Li&#x27;s N73 V12 engine, producing . Claimed fuel economy is and the hydrogen is stored as a liquid in an insulated tank. Only 100 cars were made, which were leased to high-profile customers, in order to promote the use of hydrogen vehicles.

== Alpina B7 ==

The Alpina B7 prototype was introduced to the public at the 2003 Geneva Motor Show in March, and the production version was later unveiled at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show. Production began in February 2004, and was built in the Dingolfing BMW plant alongside the facelift model - E66.

The Alpina B7 uses a supercharged version of the 4.4-litre V8 found in the 745i, and was the first Alpina model to feature a supercharged engine.

Exterior changes include a rear spoiler and 21-inch traditional Alpina multi-spoke style wheels. Interior changes include sports seats, an Alpina instrument cluster, a three spoke steering wheel with shift buttons, and a silver plated production plaque.

A total of 1114 cars were produced, including 803 cars for North America.

== Yearly changes ==
=== 2003 ===
* iDrive updates including faster processor, addition of &quot;menu&quot; and &quot;customisable&quot; buttons and maps switching to DVD format.

=== 2005 facelift===
In March 2005, the facelift (also known as &quot;LCI&quot;) models began production. The major changes were:
* Revised styling for front and rear bodywork, headlights, tail-lights, and a less pronounced trunk lid to address the criticisms of the pre-facelift design. BMW offered &quot;conversion kits&quot; that could be purchased by existing owners to apply these exterior changes to pre-facelift cars.
* iDrive updates including a simplified interface, clearer graphics, and the iDrive controller now having a leather top surface.
* Petrol V8 engines increased in displacement, resulting in the 735i model being replaced by the 740i and the 745i being replaced by the 750i. 745d model power increased from 220 kW to 242 kW.
* Rear track width increased by .
* Adaptive cruise control upgraded to ACC II.

=== Late 2005 ===
In late 2005, night vision (&quot;BMW night vision&quot;) became available. The system uses passive infrared sensors and has a claimed range of .

Automatic highbeam headlamps (&quot;BMW high-beam assistant&quot;) was introduced at the same time, whereby the high beam headlights are automatically activated in dark areas and temporarily deactivated when oncoming traffic is detected.

== Production ==
The E65 was produced at the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing in Germany, with complete knock-down (CKD) assembly for local markets conducted in Thailand (Rayong), Russia (Kaliningrad) and Egypt (6th of October City).

The following are production figures for E65 7 Series models:

<doc id="882209" wikidata="Q796458" url="?curid=882209" title="BMW X5 (E53)">
<text>The BMW E53 is the first generation BMW X5 mid-size luxury crossover SUV. The vehicle was the first SUV ever produced by BMW. It was produced between 1999 and 2006 and was replaced by the E70 X5.

The E53 X5 was developed just after the acquisition of Land Rover by BMW. As such, the vehicle shares many components and designs with both the Range Rover L322 model (specifically the hill descent system and off-road engine management system) and the BMW E39 5 Series (specifically engines and electronic systems). The entire in-car entertainment system (radio function, navigation system, television and telecommunications systems) are shared with other BMWs and L322. As a result, the earlier X5 models can be upgraded with newer BMW technologies (e.g. Bluetooth phone connectivity).

==History==
The history of the X5 begins in 1994, when ideas began on a BMW sports utility vehicle after the acquisition of Land Rover. Eduard Walek was named project leader and chief engineer of the E53. Chris Chapman joined BMW Group&#x27;s Designworks in California later and began working with Chris Bangle in Munich on two full-scale clay models of the E53 for two months. By 1996, design work was approved and the design basis for the E53 X5 was frozen, 35 months prior to production. Design patents were filed on 10 June 1998 and 9 December 1998, being registered in the U.S. on 18 January 2000.

The takeover of Rover in 1994 proved to be very beneficial for BMW in the development of the X5. BMW engineers were able to look at and use Range Rover technology and parts in the development of the X5 - one such example would be hill-descent control. In many respects, the design of the X5 was influenced by its British counterpart; for example, the X5 got the two-piece tailgate straight from the Range Rover. Many parts and electronics were also taken directly from the E39 5 Series parts bin to save costs.

In contrast to the Range Rover models, the X5 was designed as a sporting road car: its off-road capabilities are significantly less than those of Land Rover. BMW reportedly worked hard to ensure it was referred to as an &quot;SAV&quot; (Sports Activity Vehicle) instead of an &quot;SUV&quot; (sport utility vehicle).

Even though the X5 was an all-wheel drive vehicle, BMW chose from the start to route 62 percent of the engine&#x27;s torque to the rear wheels, making it feel as close as possible to the company&#x27;s rear-wheel drive sedans.

== Engines ==
===Gasoline===

=== Diesel ===

==Interior design==

The interior design of the E53 X5 was shared with the BMW 5 Series (E39), featuring a similar dashboard layout. The BMW Business Cassette head unit was standard equipment on all E53 X5 models, and included controls for a separately-mounted CD changer unit. The BMW Business CD head unit was optional, and later became standard equipment on newer E53 X5 models. The BMW Business CD head unit also included controls for an accessory CD changer unit. A GPS navigation system radio was also available, and replaced the standard CD player with a cassette player located behind the unit&#x27;s retractable LCD display screen, but included controls for an accessory CD changer unit. A &quot;Hi-Fi&quot; premium sound system was standard equipment on all E53 X5 models, while an upgraded system with a Digital Sound Processing (DSP) was optional, regardless of head unit option. The BMW Assist telematics system was an option on the E53 X5, and included an &quot;SOS&quot; button in the overhead console.

==Production==
The X5, along with the BMW Z4 (E85) roadster, BMW X6, and BMW X3 were manufactured in BMW&#x27;s South Carolina plant in Greer and at the BMW de México plant in Toluca, Mexico, alongside the BMW 3 series, BMW 5 series and BMW 7 series. Production of the E53 X5 began on 1 September 1999 and ceased on 22 September 2006.

==X5 LM==
A one-off version known as the X5 LM was equipped with the P75 engine based on the S70/3 V12 engine from the 1999 Le Mans winning BMW V12 LMR. It was used by Hans-Joachim Stuck to set a lap record at the Nürburgring in 2000.

==4.6is and 4.8is==
A sport model, badged 4.6is was released in 2001. The 4.6is, equipped with the M62B46 V8 engine, made . The 4.6is was available in 4 colors (black, imola red, estoril blue, and titanium silver). It featured 20 inch wheels that were fitted over larger brakes than the stock X5. It also had additional rear fender flares along with different front and rear bumpers. In 2004, the 4.6is was replaced by a 4.8is model which was not the M62B48 4.8L V8, which Alpina developed for its Alpina B10 V8S
and the Alpina Roadster V8, but rather an entirely new engine called the N62 engine producing .

==2003 facelift==
In 2000, development on mid-cycle updates began scheduled for 2003. By late 2001, a radical design update was chosen favoring the new brand design theme. In 2002, following discontent towards the 2001 E65 design, a more conservative appearance was instead chosen and frozen for 2003 production.

In July 2003, the facelifted X5 was presented for the 2004 model year at the IAA 2003 in September, with new headlights, a few new exterior colors, a new four-wheel drive system and upgraded engines. Production started at Spartanburg on 26 September. The grilles were enlarged, as well as their actual slats being modified in a &#x27;flame surfaced&#x27; style. In keeping with the E39 facelift of 2001, the 2004 X5&#x27;s headlights got corona rings around all four headlamp projectors. The tail-lights also received a facelift similar to the BMW E39, and the exterior glass went from a &quot;dotted&quot; pattern to a cleaner &quot;line&quot; pattern. BMW invented a new four-wheel drive system dubbed xDrive shared both in the X5 and X3 in 2004. Instead of using the previous X5 system which consisted of power being split 62-38 (rear wheels-front wheels) and DSC to brake wheels without losing traction, xDrive could vary power to the front or rear axles in milliseconds, transferring up to 100% of engine power to either axle, thus allowing the vehicle to regain traction quickly.

The X5 got the new 4.4i engine which debuted in the 2002 7 Series; power output rose from . Also from April onwards, a new X5 4.8is was offered (see below), producing . Sales began in September 2003.

Several new extras were added to the 2004 X5 such as:
* Soft-boot close feature (the top part of the trunk pulls itself closed)
* Trailer Stability Program (making it an ideal tow vehicle)
* Adaptive Headlights (available only with xenon HID headlamps; these swivel with the direction of travel of the car. Bi-Xenon headlights for both low and high beam replaced the low beam HID headlights)

Originally announced in the end of 2003 along with the rest of the X5 facelift, the X5 4.8is first started shipping in April 2004. It had a new larger 4.8 L engine (which replaced the 4.6 L engine), and was also later used in the 2005 750i/Li. It also included a slightly modified bodykit (parts of the bottom bumper became painted the body color), 20&quot; wheels, and along with the 4.6is, were the only X5&#x27;s ever to have a large chrome-tipped exhaust which hid the quad pipes.

==X5 Security==
The &#x27;Security&#x27; edition is an X5 variant with safety glass, heavy-duty material and ballistics-resistant steel, and debuted at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show.

Features include:
* B4/VR4 ballistic protection, capable of withstanding handguns up to a .44 Magnum, including .357 Magnum or 9mm Luger.
* Polycarbonate coated glass to reduce spall.
* An intercom to speak with people outside the vehicle.
* An assault alarm, which when activated, locks all doors and emits both visual and audio alert signals.
* Run-flat tires allowing one to continue driving with flat tires at up to for approximately .

==Chinese copy controversy==
In June 2008, the Regional Court of Munich ruled that the Chinese SUV model, &quot;Shuanghuan SCEO&quot; is a copy of the BMW X5, prohibited the defendant importer of these vehicles in the &quot;trade in Germany&quot; offer and ordered the destruction of all &quot;vehicles with a certain look&quot; at which the defendant&#x27;s possession or ownership (Az.: 4HK O 16807/07).

<text>The BMW E70 is the second-generation BMW X5 mid-size luxury crossover SUV. It replaced the BMW X5 (E53) in July 2006. It was manufactured alongside the BMW X6 at BMW&#x27;s Greer, South Carolina plant in the U.S. and BMW&#x27;s facility in Toluca, Mexico.

==Design==
The E70 BMW X5 was wider, longer; with a longer wheelbase, but remains at the height of the E53 X5 at .

==Technology==

The xDrive AWD system updates previewed in the facelifted X5 have continued with further detail improvements for the E70. It uses a double wishbone suspension at the front. The manual transmission is entirely dropped, leaving only the automatic transmission.

The E70 features many new technological advancements for this class as standard equipment including BMW&#x27;s iDrive system, electronic &#x27;joystick&#x27; gearshift (no mechanical connection to the gearbox to save space in the console), LED taillamps, the first ever all-polypropylene single module fender module, and options such as heads-up display (HUD), active steering, active damping, and Dynamic Drive which uses active anti-roll bars employing a hydraulic servo in the middle to actively counteract body roll. The X5 has a rollover risk of 17.4%.

The interior of the X5 is completely new. It has a large center-mounted display screen and the simplified iDrive, a man-machine interface system also found in the rest of the BMW model range. The E70 further incorporates many comfort options such as a glass panorama-roof, and, for the first time in a BMW, an optional third row seat which has increased the seating capacity in E70 to 7 passengers, addressing criticism of the E53 model which had been regarded as being slightly too small for this market segment.

The E70 is also the first production vehicle to use FlexRay, a new extremely fast electrical bus system; it is only used for the control of the chassis damping system. The new &#x27;joy-stick&#x27;-style electronic space-saving shifter has since been adopted in the new 2007 BMW 5 Series.

For the 2010 model year the X5 received the new iDrive system and the BMW individual audio system along with various other minor updates.

Technical features which other BMW models use also:

* Active steering- changes the steering ratio depending on the speed and driving style
*&quot;Adaptive Drive&quot; with Active Roll Stabilization and adaptive shock absorbers
* Head-up display - critical information projected onto the windshield
*&quot;Comfort Access&quot; - keyless access and engine start
* Daytime running lights on the &quot;Corona Rings&quot; around the main headlight units
* Four-zone climate control

New is the &quot;Park Distance system&quot; that can be integrated into the image of the optional rearview camera.

During the Volkswagen emissions violations, an X5 diesel was used as an example of a compliant vehicle.

==BMW X5 M (2010–13)==


The BMW X5 M is a high-performance derivative of the X5. It was introduced to the press at the New York Auto Show in April 2009 and started appearing in BMW dealerships in September 2009, for the 2010 model year. It competes with cars such as the Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG, the Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, and the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8. 

The BMW X5 M is the first xDrive all-wheel-drive vehicle from M GmbH along with the X6 M. The M offers the same utility as the regular X5, with the addition of the V8 M TwinPower Turbo, a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 delivering at 5,750 rpm and peak torque of , available between 1,500 and 5,650 rpm. The S63 engine is a high output variation of the N63 power unit.

The X5 M can sprint from a standstill to in 4.0 seconds, and a quarter-mile (402 m) time of 12.5 seconds with a trap speed of was recorded by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine. In the same test, the X5 M bested the 0– and quarter-mile times of the 2009 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, the 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT-8, and the 2010 Range Rover Sport Supercharged. In wet conditions, the X5 M went around the Top Gear Test Track in 1:28.2, 5.1 seconds faster than the Audi Q7 V12 TDI.

Coupled with special suspension specifically optimized for M that features Adaptive Drive and the newly developed M Servotronic power steering, the performance Sport Activity Vehicle promises very competent handling. Other high-tech features include launch control for maximum acceleration and a six-speed M Sport automatic transmission optimized for performance. Drivers can manually select gears using either paddles or an electronic gear selector lever. Electronically controlled, variable power distribution to the front and rear axle prevents the tendency to oversteer or understeer, before DSC Dynamic Stability Control is required to cut in.

The BMW X5 M features the biggest brakes on a BMW production vehicle, with 15.55-inch (395 mm × 36 mm) rotors up front clamped by four-piston calipers, and 15.2-inch (385 mm × 24 mm) rotors at the rear with single-piston calipers. Although traction control is standard, the M Dynamic Mode (MDM) reduces the effect of the system, allowing some wheelspin and drift-type cornering.

For the 2013 model lineup, BMW introduced the M Performance Package available for the xDrive35i and xDrive50i. The M Performance Package models have nearly identical features to the X5 M (sport suspension, wider fenders, staggered wheels, etc.) excluding the quad-tip exhaust, headlights, and engines. The M Performance Package also bumped up the engine output for both models - an additional for the xDrive35i and for the xDrive50i (torque was also increased by 30 lb-ft for both).

M Performance Parts were available for the X5 M. These include black kidney grilles, steel pedals, a sport steering wheel and M rims.

==Model lineup==

===Engines===
====Petrol engines====
====Diesel engines====
Since 2008, vehicles sold with diesel engines in the United States are equipped with selective catalysator using Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) to reduce NOx emissions, while vehicles sold in Europe had a bypass exhaust pipe only due the regulations which ended up in Dieselgate.

===Transmissions===
All models include a 6-speed &quot;Steptronic&quot; automatic transmission called a ZF 6HP 26, or ZF 6HP 26X for xDrive models.
The new 8-speed transmissions are standard in the xDrive50i and xDrive35i from 2011 model year. The 35i uses a ZF 8HP 45 transmission while the 50i uses a ZF 8HP 70 model.

===Performance===
===Safety===
*Winner of &quot;Top Safety Pick 2008&quot; by Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

====NHTSA====
==2010/2011 X5 &quot;Life Cycle Impulse&quot; (LCI) Changes==
In 2010 the X5 underwent a &quot;Life Cycle Impulse&quot; (LCI) update, debuted at the New York Auto Show in April 2010 and introduced as 2011 models in BMW North America markets. The changes included revised styling, primarily of the front and rear bumpers, air intakes, headlights, and taillights as well as new exterior and interior colors and new options combination. It also included BMW Group&#x27;s latest infotainment system. HD Radio, previously an option, was now standard on all X5 models in North America.

More significantly, a new range of engines, all turbocharged and with direct injection was introduced. In the North American market, available gasoline power trains are the xDrive 35i twin-scroll turbo six-cylinder and the xDrive50i twin turbo V8, both coupled to an eight-speed automatic Steptronic transmission. These petrol engines are more powerful than their predecessors, with the 35i also providing improved fuel mileage and reduced emissions. The xDrive 35d turbodiesel carries over in the NA market with the six-speed transmission unchanged from the previous model year. The xDrive40d was also introduced along with a revised xDrive30d, but neither was available in the North American market.

The X5M engine and transmission remains the same.


==BMW X5 Security Plus==
It is a variant with safety glass, heavy-duty material and ballistics-resistant steel modifications. It comes with a 4.8l engine with &quot;Steptronic&quot; automatic transmission. Armour is rated to safety class VR4 and is configured to carry a roof mounted 7.62mm, AK-47 assault rifle. The vehicle sells for approximately $220,000.

==Vision Efficient Dynamics==
It is a hybrid electric vehicle model featuring 2.0 L four-cylinder variable twin-turbo diesel engine rated and at 2,000–2,250 rpm, a 15-kilowatt electric motor driven by a lithium ion battery pack, eight-speed transmission developed by BMW and ZF, roof-mounted solar panels, 19-inch light alloy wheels with reduced ventilation. It was unveiled in 2008 at the Geneva Auto Show.

<text>The first generation of the BMW Z4 consists of the BMW E85 (roadster version) and BMW E86 (coupe version) sports cars. The E85/E86 generation was produced from 2002 to 2008. The E85/E86 replaced the Z3 and is the third model in the BMW Z Series. Initial models were in the roadster (E85) body style, with the coupé (E86) body style being added in 2006. In February 2009, the BMW Z4 (E89) began production as the successor to the E85/E86.

As was its Z3 predecessor, the E85/E86 was manufactured in Greer, South Carolina. The M model, the Z4 M, is powered by the S54 straight-six engine.

== Development and launch ==
The E85 was designed by Danish BMW-designer Anders Warming from mid-1998 to the summer of 1999. The coupe models were designed by Tomasz Sycha. The E85 designs were frozen on March 1, 2000. The Z4 was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in 2002, and North American models went on sale in November of the same year (as the 2003 model year). European sales began in March 2003.

Initial models consisted of the roadster body style powered by a 2.5L or 3.0L 6-cylinder engine.

== Body styles ==
=== Roadster (E85) ===
The Z4 Roadster was launched in 2002 with the 2.5i and 3.0i six-cylinder models. Transmission choices were a five-speed manual, six-speed manual, five-speed automatic and a six-speed &quot;SMG-II&quot; automated manual transmission.

A four-cylinder model, the Z4 2.0i Roadster, was introduced for the European market in May 2005.

The drag coefficient is maximum of .

=== Coupé (E86) ===

BMW unveiled a concept coupé version of the Z4 at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show. The design of the Z4 and Z4 coupé has variously been ascribed to Anders Warming, Chris Bangle, the controversial former BMW Head of Design, and Adrian van Hooydonk, former BMW chief designer, and BMW designer Tomasz Sycha. The design was approved in Summer of 2004 and frozen in December 2004. The company announced in 2005 that the two-door coupé would be available for production including the return of the M Coupé. The production car was introduced at the New York Auto Show in April 2006 and was available for sale in late May 2006.

Thanks to its hatch design, the Z4 Coupé offers of trunk space, compared with for the roadster.

The Coupe&#x27;s fixed roof increases torsional rigidity, resulting in a stiffness of per degree of body twist on the coupe (compared to per degree on the roadster), which improves turn-in and overall handling response. The roof has a &quot;double-bubble&quot; contour which serves as an aerodynamic aid and offers more headroom than the roadster with the soft top closed. The Coupé has a sleek fastback rear window that slopes down to an integrated spoiler which is shaped to deliver downforce to the rear axle at high-speed.

The model range for the Coupé was more limited than the roadster, and consisted of the six-cylinder 3.0si and Z4 M model only. Transmission choices were a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic with shift paddles mounted on the steering column.

== Chassis and body ==

Compared with its Z3 predecessor, the Z4 is larger and has a stiffer chassis. As per the Z3, the front suspension is a Macpherson strut design. The rear suspension uses a multi-link design, instead of the semi-trailing design used by the Z3. 

The Z4 used lightweight materials to offset the increased weight over the smaller Z3, such as an aluminum hood and suspension components, magnesium roof frame. Run-flat tires removed the need for a spare tire, which reduces weight and allows for a larger trunk.

== Equipment ==
The 6-cylinder engines included all-alloy construction, variable valve timing (double-VANOS), and throttle by wire. Safety technology included four-wheel disc brakes and electronic stability control, incorporating ABS and traction control.

An optional &quot;Sport Package&quot; included added stiffer and lower suspension, 18 inch wheels, and sport tuned electronic steering, throttle and shift parameters (&quot;Dynamic Driving Control&quot;).

Electric power steering replaced the traditional hydraulic power steering used by the Z3. The power assist is speed-sensitive, allowing for easier maneuvering at low speeds. However, the Z4 M uses hydraulic power steering, and has been judged as having a more direct and communicative feel to the steering.

In 2002 a 6-speed &quot;SMG&quot; gearbox was offered as an option on the 2.5 and 3.0 roadsters.

== Transmissions ==
The available transmissions were:
* 5-speed manual Getrag S5D250G (2.2i, 2.5i)
* 6-speed manual Getrag GS6-17BG (2.0i)
* 6-speed manual ZF GS6-37BZ-TJEE (Z4M)
* 6-speed manual ZF GS6-37BZ-THEA/TJES (3.0&amp;3.0si)
* 5-speed automatic ZF 5HP19 (2.2i, 2.5i, 3.0i ~ MY 03-05)
* 6-speed automatic ZF 6HP19 (2.5si, 3.0i, 3.0si ~ MY 06-08)
* 6-speed GS6-S37BZ &quot;SMG&quot; automated manual (2.5i, 3.0i)

== Models ==
* The 2.0i was only sold in Europe.

All models are E85 roadsters except as noted. European specifications shown. North American vehicles may have slightly lower power ratings. US models include 2.5i Roadster, 3.0i Roadster, 3.0si Roadster &amp; Coupé, M Roadster &amp; Coupé.

== Z4 M versions ==

The Z4 M Coupé/Roadster was introduced in 2006 and is powered by the S54 straight-six engine shared with the E46 M3. The S54 was also on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2001 through 2004. The engine in the North American Z4 M models are rated at at 7,900 rpm, 3 hp less than the North American M3. In other markets, the power output is the same as the M3. The engine had BMW double VANOS system and a compression ratio of 11.5:1. The torque generated by the engine amounted to at 4,500 rpm. The torque was available from 2,500 rpm.

The Z4 M uses hydraulic power steering, unlike the electric power steering used by the rest of the Z4 range. The Roadster used the E46 M3 steering rack, the Coupé the faster M3 CS/CSL rack. Other changes include a wider front track, revised front suspension, wider non-runflat-tires (measuring 225/45 at the front, 255/40 at the rear), and steering geometry. The brakes and the entire rear axle was too from the M3 CS/CSL.

The M Coupé&#x27;s production began at the Spartanburg BMW plant in Greer on 4 April 2006.
== Special models ==
=== Alpina Roadster S (2004–2006) ===

The Alpina Roadster S is a high-performance iteration of the pre-facelift Z4 introduced at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show. Manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Alpina, the Roadster S was assembled at the manufacturer&#x27;s Buchloe plant from body-in-white sent by the Spartanburg BMW factory. The Roadster S was produced for two years (2004 to 2005) before production was halted due to stricter emission regulations stopping engine supplies. The Roadster S was available in two trims, those being Standard and Luxury with the Luxury trim adding more creature comforts and bigger wheels over the Standard trim. The car had a claimed top speed of and accelerated to from a standstill in 5.3 seconds. The engine was modified by Alpina and change the name to E5/2. The engine create max output 300hp and max torque 362 Nm.

=== Concept Coupé Mille Miglia (2006) ===

The Concept Coupé Mille Miglia is a concept car inspired by the BMW 328 Mille Miglia Touring Coupé. It was unveiled at the 2006 Mille Miglia rally in Italy.

Using the Z4 M Coupé&#x27;s mechanical components, the concept car is longer, wider but flatter than the Z4 M Coupé. Other features of the concept car include 20-inch alloy wheels with 245/40R20 tyres, permanently integrated sidewalls, swing-up cockpit, an LED headlight panel, silver-coloured carbon-fibre reinforced plastic body and an interior constructed from stainless steel, untreated cowhides and Lycra fabric.

The vehicle was designed by Anders Warming.

== Model year changes ==
=== 2005 ===
* Four-cylinder model (2.0i) introduced.

=== 2006 facelift or LCI ===

The Z4 facelift (also known as LCI) models were launched at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The major changes were:
* Introduction of Coupé models.
* Introduction of the M Roadster, powered by the S54 straight-six engine (the M Coupe began production a few months later, in April 2006)
* Discontinuation of the 2.2i model.
* Introduction of &quot;si&quot; models.
* Six-cylinder engines (aside from the M Roadster) upgraded from the M54 to the N52.

== Motorsport ==
=== Endurance racing ===

Dieter Quester, Dirk Werner, Jamie Campell-Walter and Tim Mullen won the Silverstone Britcar 24-Hour race with a BMW Z4 M Coupé. The unit of the racing version is a modified version of the S54B32 3.2-litre straight-six engine, producing approximately . The car is made by BMW&#x27;s M Division and called the Z4 M Coupé Motorsport.

In the 2008 Super Taikyu Endurance Series in Japan, the Petronas Syntium Team entered two Z4M cars. The cars dominated the series by taking first and second at every race, finishing the Super Taikyu 1 class in first and second place to win both the championship and drivers title. The Petronas Syntium Team earned 277 points, compared to the next placed team on 98 points. The cars were driven by established and popular drivers such as Fariqe Hairuman, Nobuteru Taniguchi, Masataka Yanagida, Manabu Orido and father and son pairing of Hans-Joachim Stuck and Johannes Stuck.

=== Super GT ===
In August 2008, a modified Z4 debuted in Round 6 of the Super GT season, marking BMW&#x27;s return to the series after the M3 was retired from the JGTC series. It was run by the Studie team and participated in the GT300 class. The car was powered by a detuned version of the S62 V8 engine from the E39 M5. The Z4 competed in the 2009 Super GT season (aside from than Sepang Race), and they would replace their H-pattern to a sequential transmission, as well as their S62 Engine with an S65B40 after race 3, after they had suffered an unrepairable engine blow in race 2 at Suzuka. The car was retired at the end of the 2009 season, with its E89 Z4 GT3 successor making its debut in the 2010 season.

<text>Albert Stewart (April 9, 1900 – September 23, 1965) was an American sculptor.

==Life==
He was born in Kensington, England.

He arrived in America in 1908 and was orphaned shortly thereafter. Through the intervention of a wealthy benefactor, Edwin T. Bechtel, Stewart was allowed to pursue his art studies at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and the Art Students League of New York, staples for young and impoverished sculptors of the day. Upon completing his studies, Bechtel helped him obtain some needed commissions.

Dr. George Frederick Kunz, vice-president of Tiffany &amp; Co., also assisted him, and after his death in 1932, in his will, he bequeathed to &quot;Albert T. Stewart, a friend and sculptor,&quot; five shares of non-par capital stock in Tiffany &amp; Co.

During World War I, he went to Canada and joined the Royal Air Force. When he returned after the war, he worked as an assistant to both Frederick MacMonnies and Paul Manship.

During the 1930s he worked as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) artist. Throughout his career Stewart frequently was employed to create architectural sculptures. In 1939, he was appointed head of the sculpture program at Scripps College in Claremont, California at the invitation of Millard Sheets. He moved to California and stayed there the rest of his life.

<doc id="882221" wikidata="Q290247" url="?curid=882221" title="La Hire">
<text>Étienne de Vignolles, Sieur de Montmorillon, Chatelain de Longueville (), also known as La Hire (; 1390 – 11 January 1443), was a French military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

==Nickname==
One explanation for his nickname of La Hire would be that the English had nicknamed him &quot;the Hire-God&quot; (Ira Dei: the wrath of God). Alternatively, his name may simply come from the French &quot;hedgehog&quot; (&quot;hérisson&quot;) because he had a prickly disposition.

== Military career ==
La Hire joined Charles VII in 1418, when the English army invaded France. Although not a noble, La Hire was regarded a very capable military leader as well as an accomplished rider. Three years later, in 1421 he fought at the Battle of Baugé. Along with Jean de Dunois, La Hire was involved in scouting and skirmishing in the countryside as far north as Paris. In 1427, both La Hire and Dunois relieved the siege of Montargis. He was a close comrade of Joan of Arc. He was one of the few military leaders who believed in her and the inspiration she brought, and he fought alongside her at Orleans. At the Battle of Patay, La Hire commanded the vanguard and won a great victory for France. La Hire was also known for praying before going into battle, something that could be attributed to Joan&#x27;s influence. In 1430, La Hire captured the English held fortification of Château Gaillard. He was imprisoned in Dourdan in the spring of 1431. He won the Battle of Gerberoy in 1435 and was made Captain General of Normandy in 1438. His last two major military engagements occurred in 1440 at Pontoise where he assisted Dunois to capture it from the English; and in 1442 he assisted Charles of Orleans in capturing La Réole. He died at Montauban on 11 January 1443, of an unknown illness.

==In popular culture==

In French tradition, &quot;La Hire&quot; is used as a nickname for the knave of hearts. &lt;br&gt;
His name remains a byword for a choleric disposition.

===Literature===
La Hire is a minor figure in the &quot;Catherine&quot; novels of Juliette Benzoni.

=== Film, theatre and TV ===
In Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s film &quot;Joan the Woman&quot;, La Hire was played by Hobart Bosworth. In the French film &quot;La Merveilleuse Vie de Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; (1929), he was played by Fernand Mailly.

La Hire was also played by veteran John Ford &quot;stock company&quot; member Ward Bond in Victor Fleming&#x27;s classic 1948 Technicolor film &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, which starred Ingrid Bergman.

In Otto Preminger&#x27;s 1957 version of &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, La Hire was portrayed by Patrick Barr.

On British television, in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; (1968) version of &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, La Hire was portrayed by Jack Watson. In the USA, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; did two versions of the story - &quot;The Lark&quot; (1957), La Hire being played by Bruce Gordon, and &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1967), in which the character was played by Dana Elcar.

In the two-part French film &quot;Jeanne la Pucelle&quot; (1994), La Hire was portrayed by Stephane Boucher. In the television miniseries &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1999), La Hire was played by Peter Strauss. Also in 1999, La Hire appeared in the feature film &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot;, portrayed by actor Richard Ridings.

In the Czech musical &quot;Johanka z Arku&quot; (2003), La Hire was portrayed by Petr Kolář and Kamil Střihavka.

=== Computer games ===
La Hire appears in &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; (1999) in the Joan of Arc campaign. A powerful &quot;Champion&quot;-class infantry unit, he is portrayed as an accomplished and capable yet Hulk-like brute that refers to himself in the third person. His remarks include &quot;La Hire wishes to kill something&quot;, &quot;The blood on La Hire&#x27;s sword is almost dry&quot;, and &quot;La Hire&#x27;s sword is not bloody enough!&quot;.

La Hire is featured as a character in the tactical roleplaying video game &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; (2005). In the game, La Hire is depicted as an axe-wielding lion beastman warrior and mercenary, known for his overwhelming strength and a fiery temperament.

In &quot;Wars and Warriors: Joan of Arc&quot; (2004), La Hire is a playable character who is portrayed as a giant with stunning strength. He fights with a massive club.

In &quot;Armored Core: For Answer&quot; (2008), one of the featured mechs is designated TYPE-LAHIRE. La Hire is also a character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2015).

La Hire has a less than significant appearance in &quot;Age of Empires IV&quot; (2021) during the &quot;Battle of Patay&quot; mission of the Hundred Years War campaign. He does not appear physically, in fact his only depiction in the game is his name, but players can hire squads of Royal Knights from him during the mission.

<doc id="882226" wikidata="Q6412179" url="?curid=882226" title="King &amp; Story, San Jose">
<text>The King &amp; Story, also known as Story &amp; King, neighborhood of San Jose, California is located in the Alum Rock district of East San Jose, centered on the intersection of King and Story roads. King &amp; Story is one of San Jose&#x27;s most notable and historic Chicano/Mexican-American neighborhoods.

==History==

The area surrounding King and Story, zip code 95122, is a hub for the East San Jose Community and for Latino culture in San Jose. The neighborhood is sometimes known as Tropicana, after the shopping center on the southwest corner of the intersection. In the 1930s, future agricultural labor union leader César Chávez and his family moved into the neighborhood. It was here that Chávez first began his political actions, registering voters and organizing English language classes for the mostly Mexican American residents. The first grocery stores targeted by the NFWA grape boycott were on King Road. In the 1980s the area was a hub of lowrider culture, and the &quot;Mural de la Raza&quot;, which depicts Chicano history and was created on a wall near the intersection in that decade, is now one of the oldest murals in the city. The Mi Pueblo Hispanic supermarket chain started at the intersection.

At the start of the 21st century, the San Jose Redevelopment Agency pursued redevelopment of the intersection, successfully locating a grocery store on the north-east corner before pursuing eminent domain to redevelop the southeast and southwest corners. On the southeast corner, in conjunction with local developers Blake-Hunt Ventures, vacant and abandoned buildings were replaced with needed banking and shopping options. However, after encountering a court challenge to its acquisition of the Tropicana shopping center on the southwest corner, the city paid $6.8 million in 2002 to the primary landowner who contended that his own redevelopment plans had been unfairly interfered with, and settled for acquisition of certain portions and the redevelopment of the remainder in conjunction with the existing owners.

In 2003, the San Jose City Council considered a bill to rename King Road, named for an 1851 settler to San Jose, after Martin Luther King Jr. The proposal was generally supported by the African American community and opposed by the Hispanic population. The city council eventually rejected the proposal.

In the late 2000s the neighborhood was badly impacted by the subprime mortgage crisis.

==Culture==
King &amp; Story is one of the most historic centers of the Chicano/Mexican-American community in San Jose.

===Lowriding===
King and Story is also recognized as being the &quot;Whittier Boulevard of the North&quot; which has many similar characteristics as East Los Angeles. The usage and showings of lowriders is prevalent along King Rd and Story Rd.

While lowriding began in Los Angeles during the 1940s, by the 1960s lowriding had become commonplace in East San Jose&#x27;s Chicano/Mexican-American community, particularly along the broad boulevards of Alum Rock Avenue and Story Road. &quot;Lowrider&quot; magazine was founded in San Jose in 1977 by San Jose State students Larry González, Sonny Madrid, and David Núñez. The magazine covered not only the cars, but the culture surrounding lowriders.

Today, lowrider culture permeates mainstream society through art, music and cars. Several South Bay car clubs still exist and participate in events like Cinco de Mayo celebrations and &quot;Show-n-Shine&quot; events.

<text>PSR B1620−26 is a binary star system located at a distance of 3,800 parsecs (12,400 light-years) in the globular cluster of Messier 4 (M4, NGC 6121) in the constellation of Scorpius. The system is composed of a pulsar (PSR B1620−26 A) and a white dwarf star (WD B1620−26, or PSR B1620−26 B). As of 2000, the system is also confirmed to have an exoplanet orbiting the two stars.

== History ==
The double system (&quot;triple&quot; including the substellar companion) is just outside the core of the globular cluster. The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12.2 billion years. Hence this is the age estimate for the birth of the planet, and two stars.

There is a minor dispute about the proper nomenclature rules to use for this unusual star system. One side regards the A/B convention of naming binary stars as having priority, so that the pulsar is PSR B1620−26 A, the white dwarf companion is PSR B1620−26 B and the planet is PSR B1620−26 c. The other side considers PSR to apply only to stars which are pulsars, not their companions, so the white dwarf should be named using the WD convention, making the pulsar PSR B1620−26, the white dwarf &quot;WD J1623−266&quot;, and the planet &quot;PSR B1620−26 b.&quot; Early articles used the first convention, but star catalogs have been using the second. The most recent proposal provides a nomenclature like PSR B1620−26 (AB)b, including capital letters A and B in parentheses to identify inner stellar components of binary system, followed by italic letter b referred to outer planetary companion. In practice, context makes it clear whether the pulsar, the white dwarf, the planet, or the system as a whole is being referred to.

== White dwarf ==
The mass of the white dwarf is 0.34 solar masses and orbits at a period of 191 days with an inclination of 55° relative to its pulsar companion.
Its age is approximately years.

== Planetary system ==
PSR B1620−26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on signals from the star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar).

In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, studying what they thought was a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.

<text>Pedro Ludovico Teixeira, better known as Pedro Ludovico (23 October 1891 – 16 August 1979) was the founder of Goiânia, Brazil, and one of the most important figures in the history of the state of Goiás.

Ludovico was born in Goiás. He went to Rio de Janeiro where he finished Medical School and was a friend of the writers, Lima Barreto and Olavo Bilac. He defended his thesis on hysteria, at a time when all of Freud&#x27;s theories were revolutionary. Returning to Goiás he opened a clinic in Rio Verde, but he found life in the interior monotonous. Trips to Rio alleviated his tedium which he surpassed by discovering two loves of his life: politics and &quot;Dona Gercina Borges&quot;, whom he married.

Supporting the liberal revolution of 1930 he was nominated &quot;interventor&quot; in the state of Goiás. He was to govern the state for five periods, three as &quot;interventor&quot; and two as elected governor. He was a senator three times and his struggle for the redemocratization of the country during the period of military rule after 1964 caused the government to strip him of his political office in 1968.
His iron will helped to build a new city, Goiânia, which inspired president Juscelino Kubitschek to build Brasília.

Pedro Ludovico&#x27;s son was Mauro Borges, governor of the state during the military coup of 1964 and later senator for Goiás during several periods.

<text>Pietà () is a small harbour town in the Eastern Region of Malta, located near the outskirts of the capital city Valletta. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tal-Pietà&quot; is derived from Italian, and means &quot;Pity&quot;, referring to the pity of Our Lady of Sorrows. This name came about from a chapel and rectory built in 1612 dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows.

==Description==
Pietà is the suburb next-closest to the capital after Floriana. 

Malta&#x27;s former national hospital, St. Luke&#x27;s, is located in Tal-Pietà, and an old boathouse of notable historic interest, now in use as a restaurant, is located on the waterfront. The town is named after a Church of Our Lady of Sorrows dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries which is still in active use today.

A couple of streets nearby bear the names of St. Augustine and his mother, St. Monica. Tal-Pietà was a departure point for the Gozo ferry before the construction of a yacht marina. The patrol boat depot of the Armed Forces of Malta is located at the Hay Wharf in nearby Floriana. Also within the boundaries of Pietà are St. Ursula&#x27;s Orphanage; PBS, the national broadcaster; Villa Guardamangia, which served as the residence of then Princess Elizabeth of Great Britain (later Queen Elizabeth II), when she lived in Malta between 1949 and 1951; the Ta&#x27; Braxia Cemetery Complex is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission site and where many World War I garrison veterans from the British army and navy are buried; and the headquarters of the Nationalist Party. The party built its base here in 1969. Tal-Pietà is regarded as a suburb of Ħamrun, Msida, Floriana and Valletta. Most of its resident population over the past 50 years hails from this area.

The population of Pietà was 3,853 in November 2005, which had been an increase over previous years due to a new housing estate and the redevelopment of old homes over the past thirty years. In March 2014 the population stood at 4,020.

A large number of Maltese citizens have Tal-Pietà as their place of birth, because many women gave birth at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital. Tal-Pietà is not, however, considered by the Maltese born there to be their home town, that being considered instead the town or city they first lived in.

In August 2020, a group of enthusiasts formed the first band club in Tal-Pietà named Soċjetà Filarmonika Madonna ta&#x27; Fatima, Gwardamanġa - Pietà. The first General Meeting was in November 2021. By the first months, the band club had already nearly 100 members. The premises of the band club is at 231, Triq id-Duluri, Tal-Pietà.

=== Education ===
The secondary school campus of St. Augustine&#x27;s College is located in Pietà and run by the Augustinian Order.

<text>The Lyakhovsky Islands (; ) are the southernmost group of the New Siberian Islands in the Arctic seas of eastern Russia. 
The islands are named in honour of Ivan Lyakhov, who explored them in 1773.

==Geography==
They are separated from the mainland by the Laptev Strait ( wide), and from the Anzhu Islands group by the Sannikov Strait ( wide). Two islands dominate the group:

*Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island (Great Lyakhovsky Island) with a maximum altitude of on Emy Tas
*Maly Lyakhovsky Island (Little Lyakhovsky Island) 
*Stolbovoy is a large island detached from the group.
*Yaya island 
*zatoplaimi island
*Off Great Lyakhovsky Island&#x27;s southwestern cape lies a small islet called Ostrov Khopto-Terer.
*Semyonovsky Island has now disappeared after heavy erosion. Before its disappearance, it was at 4 km2, one of the smallest islands in the archipelago.

==In popular culture==
Part of the action of two novels by Jules Verne, &quot;Waif of the Cynthia&quot; (1885) and &quot;César Cascabel&quot; (1890), takes place there. In the latter, the term &quot;Liakhov Islands&quot; refers to the New Siberian group as a whole, as the principal action is on Kotelny Island.

<text>Lladró () is a Spanish company based in Tavernes Blanques, Valencia, that produces high-end lighting, home accessories, decorative sculptures and porcelain figurines.

==History==

The company was founded in 1953 by three brothers, Juán, José and Vicente Lladró, in the village of Almàssera near Valencia. Starting with items such as vases and jugs, it wasn&#x27;t until 1956 that they started producing the sculptures for which they are now known. Interest in the items produced by the Lladró brothers saw their small workshop expand several times until eventually they moved to Tavernes Blanques in 1958.
* 1962, the brothers open the Professional Training School at their site in Tavernes Blanques to share their knowledge and experience.
* 1969, on 13 October the City of Porcelain was opened by the Spanish Minister for Industry. It took 2 years to build, and currently employs over 2,000 people.

* 1970, Lladró begins to use a new material, gres, for its sculptures. It has earthy colours and is used frequently in natural themes.
* 1973, Lladró buys 50% of the North American company Weil Ceramics &amp; Glass.
* 1974, the first blue emblem, consisting of a bellflower and ancient chemical symbol, appears on the base to show the origin of the sculpture. The Elite Collection is also launched.
* 1984, Rosa, Mari Carmen and Juan Vicente Lladró joined the company. Each is a child of each of the founding brothers. They underwent a long apprenticeship before they were permitted responsibility in the company.
* 1985, the Collectors’ Society is formed. The first annual sculpture, &quot;Little Pals&quot;, can fetch several thousand US dollars at auction due to the small number of members able to purchase it in the early years.
* 1986, Lladró forms an alliance with the Mitsui Group creating the subsidiary Bussan Lladró based in Tokyo.
* 1988, on 18 September in New York City the Lladró Museum and Gallery is opened on 57th Street in Manhattan.
* 1993, Lladró receives the Principe Felipe award for internationalisation.
* 2001, Lladró Privilege, a new customer loyalty programme, takes over from the Lladró Collectors’ Society.
* 2004, Lladró Privilege Gold, becomes a new level of loyalty programme within the Privilege programme.
* 2011, Lladró Privilege Society becomes Lladró Gold, in which only one level of membership is offered.
* 2013, Lladró expands into the lighting market with Belle De Nuit, a collection of chandeliers, lamps and sconces.
* 2013, Lladró releases the first piece in their new Dazzle collection which uses a geometric black and white design.
* 2016, PHI Industrial Acquisitions acquires a majority stake in the Lladró Group.

==Technique==
The manufacturing ingredients are kept closely guarded. The process is detailed in a number of Lladró publications and is on view for tours at the City of Porcelain. Lladró figurines are made of hard-paste porcelain.

==Marketing==
Lladró figurines are given an additional title in English as well as the Spanish original, however these names are frequently not translations (figurative or literal) but new names that are more likely to appeal to an English speaking audience. An area for some confusion is that the names of the pieces can change throughout their run so the same figurine may end up with several titles.

<text>Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island (), or Great Lyakhovsky, is the largest of the Lyakhovsky Islands belonging to the New Siberian Islands archipelago between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea in northern Russia. It has an area of , and a maximum altitude of (Emy Tas).

The peninsula projecting towards the west of the island is the Kigilyakh Peninsula &quot;(Poluostrov Kigilyakh)&quot;.

Off Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island&#x27;s southwestern cape lies a small islet called Ostrov Khopto-Terer.

The Lyakhovsky Islands are named in honour of Ivan Lyakhov, who explored them in 1773.

==Geology==
Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island consists of highly folded and faulted Precambrian metamorphic rocks and turbidites; Mesozoic turbidites and igneous rocks; and Cenozoic sediments. Exposed in southeastern part of this island, the older Precambrian. Early Proterozoic, metamorphic rocks consist of schists and amphibolites. Small exposures of Late Proterozoic schistose, quartzose sandstones and phyllitic, sericite-quartz schist (turbidites) also occur in the southeastern part of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island. The bulk of this island consists of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous turbidites composed of interbedded fine-grained sandstones, thinly bedded siltstones, and argillites. The Precambrian and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rocks are intruded by Late Cretaceous granites and granodiorites.

A blanket of unconsolidated Cenozoic sediments blankets most of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island. These sediments include Paleocene to Eocene colluvial, alluvial, and deltaic gravels, sands, clays, and coals and Oligocene to Miocene alluvial, lacustrine, deltaic, and nearshore marine sands and clays that contain beds and lenses of gravel. Overlying these sediments are Pliocene to Pleistocene colluvial, alluvial, and nearshore marine sands, silts, and clays that contain occasional gravel layers. The nearshore marine sediments contain the shells of marine mollusks and pieces of lignitized wood. Thick permafrost characterized by massive ice wedges has developed in these sediments. Contrary to the interpretations of Baron von Toll and earlier geologists, glacial tills and related sediments are completely absent within Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island.

In Soviet times on the Kigilyakh Peninsula Vladimir Voronin, then in charge of the Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Polar Station, was shown a large standing rock which had been heavily eroded and which gave name to the peninsula. The word Kigilyakh means &quot;stone man&quot; in the Yakut language.

==Quaternary geology==
The southern sea cliffs of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, which were first studied by Baron von Toll, expose a complex sequence of fossiliferous Late and Middle Pleistocene floodplain, eolian, lake, and solifluction sediments cemented by permafrost. In the 1990s and 2000s,
a Russian-German multidisciplinary team, which included the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research and Permafrost Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, studied the cryolithology, geochronology, ground ice geochemistry, paleobotany, paleontology, sedimentology, and stratigraphy of these sediments. The age of these sediments were studied in great detail using radiocarbon dating of bones, ivory, and plant remains; optically stimulated luminescence dating of bone-bearing sediments; and uranium-thorium dating of associated peat.

The oldest sediments exposed in the southern sea cliffs of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island consist of a layer of rocky, yellowish to greenish colored sediment. This layer is a thick Paleogene weathering crust (paleosol) that has developed within Permian sandstone. This paleosol has been largely modified by periglacial processes and development of ice wedges periodically during the Pleistocene. These deeply weathered sediments are unfossiliferous and characterized by the presence of weathering products like kaolinite and montmorillonite. Saalian sediments uncomfortably overlie this paleosol.

The oldest known Pleistocene sediments exposed in the southern sea cliffs of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island consist of Saalian sediments, which accumulated between 200,000 and 120,000 years ago. The lower part of these sediments consist of ice-rich, silty and silty-sandy sediments that accumulated as a Saalian ice complex between 200,000 and 170,000 years ago. They contain pebbles, peat inclusions, and peat horizons. The presence of ice belts, reticulated ice interlayers, and wide, round-shouldered ice wedges indicate that permafrost formed in these sediments as they accumulated. The lower part of this unit contains the pollen of sparse grass-sedge vegetation, which reflects a stadial environment. The upper part of this ice-rich unit contains pollen associated with dense grass-dominated tundra, which is indicative of interstadial environments. The upper part of the Saalian sediments, which lie uncomfortably on the eroded surface of the lower Saalian ice complex deposits, consists of well-sorted fine-grained sand that contains pollen characteristic of sparse grass-sedge dominated interstadial vegetation and less ground ice. These loess-like sediments accumulated within floodplains and lakes. As they accumulated between 170,000 and 120,000 years ago, ice wedge polygons formed in these sediments as the result of extremely cold and dry conditions.

Elsewhere along the coast of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, the sea cliffs expose pre-Eemian floodplain and lake sediments at their base. Eemian lake sediments fill depressions, i.e. ice wedge casts and thermokarst lakes, which developed by the surficial thawing during Eemian interglacial climates of Saalian ice-wedges and other permafrost. In some locations, the Eemian lake deposits are thicker and laterally continuous enough to form a complete blanket overlying older sediments. The Eemian sediments contain fossils indicative of an interglacial environment.

At many localities along the sea cliffs, typically over 10 meters of Early Weichselian lacustrine and loess-like floodplain deposits overlie the Eemian and pre-Eemian sediments. These sediments consist of fine-grained, well-sorted sands with rare grass and sedge pollen. They contain ice wedge polygon systems that formed during the Early Weichselian stadial, about 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, as the result of extremely cold and dry conditions.

Typically, 15 to 20 meters of Middle Weichselian ice complex deposits, which consist largely of aeolian sediments that accumulated 50,000 to 28,000 years ago, overlie the Early Weichselian sediments. These sediments contain pollen typical of the mammoth tundra-steppe environments and large ice wedge polygon systems. These sediments accumulated within a swampy, poorly drained habitat, which existed under an extremely cold continental climate. A zone of peaty deposits within this ice complex accumulated during a Middle Weichselian interstadial about 40,000 to 30,000 years ago. The Middle Weichselian deposits underlie the upland surfaces of this part of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island.

Within the southern sea cliffs of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, Late Weichselian sediments of the Last Glacial Maximum have not been found. The Ice Complex deposits associated with this period of time appear have been eroded and covered by Holocene deposits.

Where thermokarst depressions have formed by melting of the permafrost, they are filled by Holocene solifluction and lake sediments. These depressions formed as the result of the thawing of ice wedges and other permafrost during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition about 12,000 to 10,000 years ago. Lacustrine sediments filling these depressions contain a record of the Allerød warming, Younger Dryas cooling, and other climatic events. Holocene fluvial and solifluction deposits underlie valleys of streams cut into underlying Pleistocene sediments. Solifluction deposits, which were created by melting of the underlying permafrost, veneer the surface of the uplands. New ice wedge polygon systems later formed in these sediments during the Late Holocene as result of pronounced climatic cooling, which only recently has reversed in the last couple of hundred years.

Because of the formation of permafrost in these sediments and their depositional environments, prehistoric bone, shell, and plant material are well preserved and abundant. As noted above, later researchers found that the bone- and wood-bearing sediments described by Baron von Toll consist of both glacial, Saalian and Weichselian, and interglacial, Eemian and Holocene, sediments. For example, Baron von Toll&#x27;s alder tree was found in Eemian sediments, which are about 114 to 130 thousand years old. The vertebrate fossils occur in sediments that range in age from 114,000 to less than 8,000 BP.

Baron Eduard von Toll was among the first to report in detail about the abundance of Pleistocene fossils found within Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island. Under a peat composed of water mosses covering what he described as &quot;perpetual ice&quot;, now known to be permafrost, Baron von Toll found fragments of willow and the bones of post-Neogene mammals. He also reported having found in a frozen, sandy clay layer and lying on its side, a complete tree of &quot;Alnus fruticosa&quot; in length, including roots, with leaves and cones adhering. Unfortunately, his reports have been frequently either misrepresented or badly garbled by popular accounts of his findings. For example, various authors, i.e. Dr. Digby and Dr. Kropotkin misreport this tree as being high. Other publications, i.e. &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Earth&#x27;s Shifting Crust&quot; not only incorrectly state that this alder tree is high, but also they also repeat fictional claims from unreliable sources that this tree was either a &quot;fruit tree&quot; or &quot;plum tree&quot; and had &quot;green leaves&quot;and green fruit&quot; still attached. Lacking modern radiocarbon dating techniques, Baron von Toll assigned this tree and other fossils to single &quot;mammoth period&quot;. As discussed above, more recent geologic research and radiometric dating of these fossils and the sediment containing them has found that they are from different layers of Middle to Late Pleistocene glacial and interglacial sediments.

==Climate==
The Cape Shalaurova meteorological station, which lies on the southeast coast of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, at 73° 11&#x27; N 143° 56&#x27; E provides climatic data for this island. The mean precipitation is 184 mm/year as calculated for a 7-year period between April 1994 and September 2000 as calculated from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data. The heaviest precipitation, about two-thirds of the yearly total, occurs between June and September. As calculated from the same data for the same period of time, the mean temperature at Cape Shalaurova is . January is the coldest month with a mean temperature of and August is the warmest month with a mean temperature of . Mean daily temperatures range as low as and as high as .

==Vegetation==
The vegetation of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island is a mixture of rush/grass, forb, cryptogam tundra, cryptogam herb barren, and sedge/grass,moss wetland. The rush/grass, forb, cryptogam tundra covers the bulk of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island. It consists mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants typically cover about 40–80 percent of the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky. The cryptogam herb barren consists of dry to wet barren landscapes with scattered, herbs, lichens, mosses, and liverworts. Sedges, dwarf shrubs, and peaty mires are normally absent. These plants form a sparse (2–40%) and low-growing plant cover that often occurs as dark streaks on the otherwise barren lands, composed largely of bryophytes and cryptogamic crusts. Sedge/grass,moss wetlands, which occur on the northwest and southeast ends of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, consist of wetland complexes dominated by sedges, grasses, and mosses. These wetlands occupy low, perennially wet parts of the landscape.

<text>Maly Lyakhovsky Island () is the second largest of the Lyakhovsky Islands belonging to the New Siberian Islands archipelago in Laptev Sea in northern Russia. It has an area of . 

The Lyakhovsky Islands are named in honour of Ivan Lyakhov, who explored them in 1773.

==Geology==
Maly Lyakhovsky Island consists of Upper Jurassic to lower Cretaceous turbidites, also known as &quot;flysch&quot;, covered by a thin veneer of Pliocene to Pleistocene sediments. These Mesozoic rocks consist of sandstones, argillites, and shales deformed into east-northeast striking folds about wide. The Mesozoic rocks are covered by a relatively thin layer of Pliocene to Pleistocene sandy and clayey sediments of colluvial and alluvial origin. Near the coast, the alluvial sediments grade into nearshore marine sediments containing fossil marine mollusks and lignitized wood. Thick permafrost characterized by massive ice wedges has developed in these sediments.

On 29 May 2013, an expedition of North-Eastern Federal University found the remains of a 10,000-year-old carcass of a female mammoth on Maliy Lyakhovsky Island. It was reported that liquid blood was found in ice cavities below the belly even though the temperature at the time of excavation was . It was speculated that this find might reveal information about the cryoprotective properties of mammoth blood. The mammoth remains were taken to Yakutsk in Sakha Republic, Russia, for bacterial examination and tissues analysis, especially for a joint project of NEFU and Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in cloning a mammoth.

==Vegetation==
Rush/grass, forb, cryptogam tundra covers Maly Lyakhovsky Island. It is tundra consisting mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants either mostly or completely cover the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky.

<text>The Church of the Gesù (, ), officially named (), is a church located at Piazza del Gesù in the Pigna &quot;rione&quot; of Rome, Italy. It is the mother church of the Society of Jesus (best known as Jesuits). With its façade, described as &quot;the first truly baroque façade&quot;, the church served as a model for innumerable Jesuit churches all over the world, especially in Central Europe and in Portuguese colonies. Its paintings in the nave, crossing, and side chapels became models for art in Jesuit churches throughout Italy and Europe, as well as those of other orders. The Church of the Gesù is one of the great 17th-century preaching churches built by Counter-Reformation orders like the Jesuits in the Centro Storico of Romethe others being Sant&#x27;Ignazio, also of the Jesuits, San Carlo ai Catinari of the Barnabites, Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle of the Theatines, and the Chiesa Nuova of the Oratorians.

First conceived in 1551 by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the Spanish founder of the Society of Jesus active during the Protestant Reformation and the subsequent Catholic Counter-Reformation, the Gesù was also the home of the Superior General of the Society of Jesus until the wide suppression of the order in 1773. The church having been subsequently regained by the Jesuits, the adjacent &quot;palazzo&quot; is now a residence for Jesuit scholars from around the world studying at the Gregorian University in preparation for ordination to the priesthood.

== History ==
Although Michelangelo, at the request of the Spanish cardinal Bartolomeo de la Cueva, offered, out of devotion, to design the church for free, the endeavor was funded by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, grandson of Pope Paul III, the pope who had authorized the founding of the Society of Jesus. Ultimately, the main architects involved in the construction were Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, architect of the Farnese family, and Giacomo della Porta. 
The church was built on the same spot as the previous church &quot;Santa Maria della Strada&quot;, where Saint Ignatius of Loyola had once prayed before an image of the Holy Virgin. This image, now adorned with gems, can be seen in the church in the chapel of Ignatius on the left side of the altar.

Construction of the church began on 26 June 1568 to Vignola&#x27;s design. Vignola was assisted by the Jesuit Giovanni Tristano, who took over from Vignola in 1571. When he died in 1575 he was succeeded by the Jesuit architect Giovanni de Rosis. Giacomo della Porta was involved in the construction of the cross-vault, dome, and the apse.

The revision of Vignola&#x27;s façade design by della Porta has offered architectural historians opportunities for a close comparison between Vignola&#x27;s balanced composition in three superimposed planes and Della Porta&#x27;s dynamically fused tension bound by its strong vertical elements. Vignola&#x27;s rejected design remains in an engraving of 1573.

The design of this church set a pattern for Jesuit churches that lasted into the twentieth century; its innovations require enumerating. Aesthetics across the Catholic Church as a whole were strongly influenced by the Council of Trent. Although the Council itself said little about church architecture, its suggestion of simplification prompted Charles Borromeo to reform ecclesiastical building practise. Evidence of attention to his writings can be found at the Gesù. There is no narthex in which to linger: the visitor is projected immediately into the body of the church, a single nave without aisles, so that the congregation is assembled and attention is focused on the high altar. In place of aisles there are a series of identical interconnecting chapels behind arched openings, to which entrance is controlled by decorative balustrades with gates. Transepts are reduced to stubs that emphasize the altars of their end walls.
The plan synthesizes the central planning of the High Renaissance, expressed by the grand scale of the dome and the prominent piers of the crossing, with the extended nave that had been characteristic of the preaching churches, a type of church established by Franciscans and Dominicans since the thirteenth century. The Jesuits relied heavily on the acoustics of the church; they wanted the faithful to clearly hear the words of the sermon. This is why the church was constructed with a single nave, and a dome at the nave, transept intersection.

Everywhere inlaid polychrome marble revetments are relieved by gilding, frescoed barrel vaults enrich the ceiling and rhetorical white stucco and marble sculptures break out of their tectonic framing. The example of the Gesù did not eliminate the traditional basilica church with aisles, but after its example was set, experiments in Baroque church floor plans, oval or Greek cross, were largely confined to smaller churches and chapels.

The church was consecrated by Cardinal Giulio Antonio Santorio, the delegate of pope Gregory XIII, on 25 November 1584.

== Façade ==
The façade of the church was modified and done later by Giacomo Della Porta. We can see two main sections which are decorated with acanthus leaves on pilasters and column capitals. 
The lower section is divided by six pairs of pilasters (with a mix of columns and pilasters framing the main door). 
The main door is well decorated with low relief, the papal coat of arms, and a shield with the initialism SPQR, tying this church closely to the people of Rome. The main door stands under a curvilinear tympanum and over it a large medallion with the letters IHS representing the Christogram and an angel. The letters IHS are the Latin form of the first three letters of the Greek spelling of the name Jesus, indicative of both the central figure of Christianity and the Jesuit&#x27;s formal name, Society of Jesus.

The two other doors have triangle pediments, and in the higher part of this first level, two statues are set in the alignment of each of these doors. A statue of St Francis Xavier stands on the right of the façade. His left foot on a human body.
On the other side stands a statue of St Ignatius of loyola.

The upper section is divided with four pairs of pilasters and no statues. Upper and lower sections are joined by a volute on each side.

== Interior decoration ==

The first high altar is believed to have been designed by Giacomo della Porta. It was removed during the renovations in the 19th century and its tabernacle was subsequently purchased by archbishop Patrick Leahy for his new cathedral where it was installed after some minor modifications.

The present high altar, designed by Antonio Sarti (1797–1880), was constructed towards the middle of the 19th century. It is dominated by four columns under a neo-classical pediment. Sarti also covered the apse with marble and made the drawings of the tabernacle. The angels surrounding the IHS aureole were sculpted by Rinaldo Rinaldi (1793–1873). The two angels kneeling at each side of the aureole are the work of Francesco Benaglia and Filippo Gnaccarini (1804–1875). The altarpiece, representing the &quot;Circumcision of Jesus&quot;, was painted by Alessandro Capalti (1810–1868). The ceiling of the apse is adorned by the painting &quot;Glory of the Mystical Lamb&quot; by Baciccia (Giovanni Battista Gaulli).

The most striking feature of the interior decoration is the ceiling fresco, the grandiose &quot;Triumph of the Name of Jesus&quot; (1678-1679) by Giovanni Battista Gaulli. Gaulli also frescoed the cupola, including lantern and pendentives, central vault, window recesses, and transepts&#x27; ceilings.

The first chapel to the right of the nave is the Cappella di Sant&#x27;Andrea, so named because the church previously on the site, which had to be demolished to make way for the Jesuit church, was dedicated to St. Andrew. All the painted works were completed by the Florentine Agostino Ciampelli. The frescoes on the arches depict the male martyrs saints Pancrazio, Celso, Vito, and Agapito, while the pilasters depict the female martyred saints Cristina, Margherita, Anastasia, Cecilia, Lucy, and Agatha. The ceiling is frescoed with the &quot;Glory of the Virgin surrounded by martyred saints Clemente, Ignazio di Antiochia, Cipriano, and Policarpo&quot;. The lunettes are frescoed with &quot;Saints Agnes &amp; Lucy face the storm&quot; and &quot;St. Stephen and the Deacon St. Lawrence&quot;. The altarpiece depicts the &quot;Martyrdom of St Andrew&quot;.

The second chapel to the right is the Cappella della Passione, with lunette frescoes depicting scenes of the Passion: &quot;Jesus in Gethsemane&quot;, &quot;Kiss of Judas&quot;, and six canvases on the pilasters: &quot;Christ at the column Christ before the guards&quot;, &quot;Christ before Herod&quot;, &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, &quot;Exit to Calvary&quot;, and &quot;Crucifixion&quot;. The altarpiece of the &quot;Madonna with child and beatified Jesuits&quot; replaces the original altarpiece by Scipione Pulzone. The program of paintings is indebted to Giuseppe Valeriano and painted by Gaspare Celio. The altar has a bronze urn with the remains of 18th century Jesuit St. Giuseppe Pignatelli, canonized by Pius XII in 1954. Medals on the wall commemorate P. Jan Roothaan (1785–1853) and P. Pedro Arrupe (1907–1991), the 21st and 28th Superior General of the Society of Jesus.

The third chapel to the right is the Cappella degli Angeli, which has a ceiling fresco of the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; and the altarpiece of &quot;Angels worshiping the Trinity&quot; by Federico Zuccari. He also painted the canvases on the walls, &quot;Defeat of the rebel angels&quot; on right, and &quot;Angels liberate souls from Purgatory&quot; on the left. Other frescoes represent Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory. The angles in the niches of the pilasters were completed by both Silla Longhi and Flaminio Vacca.

The larger Saint Francis Xavier Chapel, in the right transept, was designed by Pietro da Cortona, originally commissioned by Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Negroni. The polychromatic marbles enclose a stucco relief representing &quot;Francis Xavier welcomed to heaven by angels&quot;. The altarpiece shows the &quot;Death of Francis Xavier in Shangchuan Island&quot; by Carlo Maratta. The arches are decorated with scenes from the life of the saint, including &quot;Apotheosis of the saint&quot; in the center, &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, &quot;Saint lost at sea&quot;, and at left, &quot;Baptism of an Indian princess&quot;, by Giovanni Andrea Carlone. The silver reliquary conserves part of the saint&#x27;s right arm (by which he baptized 300,000 people), his other remains are interred in the Jesuit church in Goa.

The last chapel on the far end of the nave, to the right of the high altar, is the chapel of the Sacro Cuore (Sacred Heart of Jesus), and contains the famous Sacred Heart of Jesus painting by Pompeo Batoni. 

The sacristy is on the right. In the presbytery is a bust of Cardinal Robert Bellarmine by Bernini. The sculptor prayed daily in the church.

The first chapel to the left, originally dedicated to the apostles, is now the Cappella di San Francesco Borgia, the former Spanish Duke of Gandia, who renounced his title to enter the Jesuit order, and become its third &quot;Preposito generale&quot;. The altarpiece, &quot;Saint Francesco Borgia in Prayer&quot; by Pozzo, is surrounded by works by Gagliardi. Ceiling frescoes of (Pentecost) and lunettes (left &quot;Martyrdom of St. Peter&quot;, to sides &quot;Faith and Hope,&quot; and right &quot;Martyrdom of St. Paul&quot;) with allegorical Religion and Charity are works of Nicolò Circignani (Il Pomarancio). Pier Francesco Mola painted the walls, on left with &quot;St. Peter in jail baptizes saints Processo &amp; Martiniano&quot;, to right is the &quot;Conversion of St. Paul&quot;. There are four monuments by Marchesi Ferrari.

The second chapel on the left is dedicated to the Nativity and called Cappella della Sacra Famiglia, commissioned by patron Cardinal Cerri who worked for the Barberini family. The altarpiece of the nativity is by Circignani. In the roof, the &quot;Celestial celebration on the nativity of Christ&quot;, on the pinnacles are David, Isaiah, Zechariah and Baruch, on the right lunette an &quot;Annunciation to the Shepherds&quot;, and on the left a &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot;. Also are frescoes on &quot;Presentation of Jesus to the Temple&quot; and &quot;Adoration by Magi&quot;. Four allegorical statues represent Temperance, Prudence on right; and Fortitude and Justice.

The third chapel to the left is the Cappella della Santissima Trinità, commissioned initially by the clerical patron Pirro Taro, named due to the main altarpiece by Francesco Bassano the Younger. The frescoes were completed mainly by three painters and assistants during 1588–1589; the exact attributions are uncertain, but it is said the Creation, the angels on the pilasters, and the designs of some of the frescoes are by the Florentine Jesuit painter, Giovanni Battista Fiammeri. Painted with assistants was the Baptism of Christ on the right wall. The &quot;Transfiguration&quot; on the left wall and the &quot;Abraham with three angels&quot; on the right oval were by Durante Alberti. &quot;God the Father behind a chorus of angels&quot; in the left oval and in the pinnacles angels with God&#x27;s attributes were completed by Ventura Salimbeni. The reliquary on the altar holds the right arm of the polish Jesuit St. Andrew Bobola, martyred in 1657 and canonized by Pius XI in 1938.

The imposing and luxurious St. Ignatius Chapel with the saint&#x27;s tomb is located on the left side of the transept and is the church&#x27;s masterpiece, designed by Andrea Pozzo between 1696 and 1700. The altar by Pozzo shows the &quot;Trinity&quot; on top of a globe. The lapis lazuli, representing the Earth, was thought to be the largest piece in the world but is actually mortar decorated with lapis lazuli. The four lapis lazuli-veneered columns enclose the colossal statue of the saint by Pierre Legros. The latter is a copy, probably by Adamo Tadolini working in the studio of Antonio Canova. Pope Pius VI had the original silver statue melted down, ostensibly to pay the war reparations to Napoleon, as established by the Treaty of Tolentino, 1797.

Originally the project was designed by Giacomo della Porta, then by Cortona; but ultimately Pozzo won a public contest to design the altar. A canvas of the Saint receives the monogram with the name of Jesus from the celestial resurrected Christ attributed to Pozzo. The urn of St. Ignatius is a bronze urn by Algardi that holds the body of the saint; below are two groups of statues where &quot;Religion defeats heresy&quot; by Legros (with a putto – on the left side – tearing pages from heretical books by Luther, Calvin and Zwingli), and &quot;Faith defeats idolatry&quot; by Jean-Baptiste Théodon.

The St. Ignatius Chapel also hosts the restored &quot;macchina barocca&quot; or &quot;baroque machine&quot; of Andrea Pozzo. During daytime the statue of St. Ignatius is hidden behind a large painting, but every day at 17.30 triumphal music is played and the painting is lowered by the machine into the altar, revealing the statue, with spotlights used to highlight various aspects of the Ignatian Altar, while describing aspects of the history and spirituality of the Society of Jesus.

The last chapel on the far end of the nave, to the left of the high altar, is the Chapel of the Madonna della Strada. The name derives from a medieval icon, once found in a now-lost Church in the piazza Altieri, venerated by Saint Ignatius. The interior is designed and decorated by Giuseppe Valeriani, who painted scenes from the life of the Virgin. The cupola frescoes were painted by G.P. Pozzi.
The painting depicting the death of Saint John Francis Regis by Jacopo Zoboli is located in the sacristy rooms.

The pipe organ was built by the Italian firm, Tamburini. It is a large, three manual instrument with 5 divisions (pedal, choir, great, swell, and antiphonal). The swell and choir are enclosed. The pipes are split into three separate locations within the church. Two ornamented façades flank the transept walls (Swell and Great on the left and Choir and Pedal on the right) and a small antiphonal division is located above the liturgical west entrance.

== Influence ==
The Church of the Gesù was the model of numerous churches of the Society of Jesus throughout the world, starting from the Church of St. Michael in Munich (1583–1597), the Corpus Christi Church in Nyasvizh (1587–1593), the Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków (1597–1619), the Cathedral of Córdoba (Argentina) (1582–1787) as well as the Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola in Buenos Aires (1710–1722), the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Tbilisi (1870–1877), and the Church of the Gesù in Philadelphia (1879–1888). Various parishes also share the name of the Church of the Gesù in Rome.

==Cardinal-deacons==
In 1965, the Church of the Gesù was made a titular church, to be held by a cardinal-deacon.

<text>This is a list of Viceroys of Grenada from the establishment of French rule in 1649 until its independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. Following independence, the viceroy of Grenada ceased to represent the British monarch and British government, and ceased to be a British person, instead the new vice regal office, renamed to Governor-General of Grenada represented (and to this day, represents) the Monarch of Grenada, and the person holding the office must be a Grenadian citizen.

== French governors of Grenada (1649–1762) ==

== British governors of Grenada (1762–1802) ==
In 1763, the Treaty of Paris ceded Grenada to the United Kingdom.

Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 differs from Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 by the addition of two methyl groups. The name &quot;Coomassie&quot; is a registered trademark of Imperial Chemical Industries.

==Name and discovery==
The name Coomassie was adopted at the end of the 19th century as a trade name by the Blackley-based dye manufacturer Levinstein Ltd, in marketing a range of acid wool dyes. In 1896 during the Fourth Anglo–Ashanti War, British forces had occupied the town of Coomassie (modern-day Kumasi in Ghana). In 1918 Levinstein Ltd became part of British Dyestuffs, which in 1926 became part of Imperial Chemical Industries. Although ICI still owns the Coomassie trademark, the company no longer manufactures the dyes.

The blue disulfonated triphenylmethane dyes were first produced in 1913 by Max Weiler, who was based in Elberfeld, Germany. Various patents were subsequently taken out on the organic synthesis.

Papers published in biochemistry journals frequently refer to these dyes simply as &quot;Coomassie&quot; without specifying which dye was used. In fact, the Colour Index lists over 40 dyes with &quot;Coomassie&quot; in their name. There are also other Coomassie &quot;blue&quot; dyes. For example, the Merck Index (10th edition) lists Coomassie Blue RL (Acid Blue 92, C.I. 13390), which has a completely different structure.

==Dye colour==
The suffix &quot;R&quot; in the name of Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 is an abbreviation for &quot;red&quot; as the blue colour of the dye has a slight reddish tint. For the &quot;G&quot; variant the blue colour has a more greenish tint. The &quot;250&quot; originally denoted the purity of the dye.

The colour of the two dyes depends on the acidity of the solution. The &quot;G&quot; form of the dye has been studied in detail. At a pH of less than 0 the dye has a red colour with an absorption maximum at a wavelength of 465 nm. At a pH of around 1 the dye is green with an absorption maximum at 620 nm while above pH 2 the dye is bright blue with a maximum at 595 nm. At pH 7 the dye has an extinction coefficient of 43,000 M−1 cm−1.

The different colours are a result of the different charged states of the dye molecule. In the red form, all three nitrogen atoms carry a positive charge. The two sulfonic acid groups have extremely low p&quot;K&quot;a and will normally be negatively charged, thus at a pH of around zero the dye will be a cation with an overall charge of +1. The green colour corresponds to a form of the dye with no net overall charge. In neutral media (pH 7), only the nitrogen atom of the diphenylamine moiety carries a positive charge and the blue dye molecule is an anion with an overall charge of −1. The p&quot;K&quot;a values for the losses of the two protons are 1.15 and 1.82, respectively. The final proton is lost under alkaline conditions and the dye becomes pink (p&quot;K&quot;a 12.4).

The dye interacts electrostatically but noncovalently with the amino and carboxyl groups of proteins. The dye molecules bind to proteins, including those in wool (keratin), to form a protein–dye complex. The formation of the complex stabilises the negatively charged anionic form of the dye, producing the blue colour, even under acid conditions when most of the molecules in solution are in the cationic form. This is the basis of the Bradford assay, which quantifies protein by Coomassie brilliant blue dye binding. The binding of the dye to a protein causes a shift in the absorbance maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm. The increase of absorption at 595 nm is monitored to determine protein concentration.

The dye also forms a complex with the anionic detergent sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). The formation of this complex stabilizes the neutral, green form of the dye. This effect can interfere with the estimation of protein concentration using the Bradford assay. It is also likely that the anionic detergent competes with the dye for binding to the protein.

==Applications in biochemistry==
Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 was first used to visualise proteins in 1963 by Fazekas de St. Groth and colleagues. Protein samples were separated electrophoretically on a cellulose acetate sheet. The sheet was then soaked in sulfosalicylic acid to fix the protein bands and transferred to a solution of the dye.

Two years later in 1965 Meyer and Lambert used Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 to stain protein samples after electrophoretic separation in a polyacrylamide gel. They soaked the gel in a dye solution containing methanol, acetic acid and water. As the dye stained the polyacrylamide gel as well as the protein, in order to visualise the protein bands they needed to destain the gel, which they did electrophoretically. Subsequent publications reported that polyacrylamide gels could be successfully destained using an acetic acid solution.

The first report of the use of the G form of the dye to visualise protein bands in polyacrylamide gels came in 1967, where the dye was dissolved in an acetic acid solution containing methanol. It was subsequently discovered that the protein bands could be stained without staining the polyacrylamide by using a colloid of the G form of the dye in a trichloroacetic acid solution containing no methanol. With this procedure it was no longer necessary to destain the gel. Modern formulations typically use a colloid of the G form of dye in a solution containing phosphoric acid, ethanol (or methanol) and ammonium sulfate (or aluminium sulfate).

The Bradford assay uses the spectral properties of Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 to estimate the amount of protein in a solution. A protein sample is added to a solution of the dye in phosphoric acid and ethanol. Under the acid conditions the dye is normally a brownish colour but on binding to the protein the blue form of the dye is produced. The optical absorbance of the solution is measured at a wavelength of 595 nm. The dye is noted for its high level of sensitivity: 5 μg of protein can be detected. However, among the disadvantages of the method is its variability of color development with different proteins: the absorbance change per unit mass of proteins varies with the type of the protein.

On binding to a protein, the negatively charged Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 dye molecule will give an overall negative charge to the protein. This property can be used to separate proteins or protein complexes using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions in a technique called blue native PAGE. The mobility of the complex in the polyacrylamide gel will depend on both the size of the protein complex (i.e., the molecular weight) and the amount of dye bound to the protein.

Coomassie blue staining can also be used as a loading control staining method in western blot analysis. It is applied as an anionic pre-antibody stain.

== Medical uses ==

In 2009, brilliant blue G was used in scientific experiments to treat spinal injuries in laboratory rats. It acts by reducing the body&#x27;s natural swelling response, which can cause neurons in the area to die of metabolic stress. Testing on the rats proved effective. In comparison to the rats that had not received the dye, the rats that were treated with the dye performed better on motion tests. It is unknown whether this treatment can be used effectively in humans. The animal experiments administered the dye within 15 minutes of injury, but to be effective in a real-life setting, where it may take time for a patient to reach the emergency room, the treatment needs to be effective even when administered up to two hours after injury. The only reported side effect was that the rats temporarily turned blue.

Under the trade names ILM Blue and Brilliant Peel, brilliant blue G is used as a stain to assist surgeons in retinal surgery. In December 2019, brilliant blue G (under the trade name TissueBlue, DORC International, Netherlands) was approved for use in humans in the United States.

Tissueblue was approved for medical use in Canada in January 2021.

== Application in forensic science ==
The ability of the Coomassie dye to target amino acids with aromatic groups (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and basic side chains (lysine, arginine and histidine) allows the Bradford assay to be used for fingerprint analysis. The assay was successfully used to identify the biological sex of the fingerprint. Female samples were shown to have a higher absorbance than male samples when tested at similar wavelengths. This provides a simpler method for fingerprint analysis by reducing the number of amino acids needing to be analyzed from 23 to 6 and requires little to no assay preparation, in contrast to the ninhydrin chemical assay, which requires assay preparation such as heating and enzyme cascade.

<text>Vela Uniform was an element of Project Vela conducted jointly by the United States Department of Energy and the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Its purpose was to develop seismic methods for detecting underground nuclear testing, and it involved many experts from academia, the sponsoring military agencies and the Atomic Energy Commission.

Vela Uniform incorporated seven underground nuclear tests in the continental United States and Alaska from October 1963 to July 1971. Seismic traces from multiple locations were analyzed for each of these events to develop methods for differentiating underground nuclear tests from other seismic events (such as earthquakes) and locating the test site. The program also involved numerous experiments using conventional high explosives.

<text>Grangegorman Development Agency is an agency of the Government of Ireland charged with redevelopment of the Grangegorman Urban Quarter, formerly within the curtilage of St. Brendan&#x27;s Hospital. Grangegorman () itself is an inner city area on the Northside of Dublin. Grangegorman, at 29 hectares, was the largest undeveloped site in the City of Dublin.

==Grangegorman Quarter==
The New Grangegorman Urban Quarter is a proposed education, health and community development by the &quot;Grangegorman Development Agency&quot; for Dublin Institute of Technology and the Health Service Executive within the existing Grangegorman Urban quarter. The site&#x27;s design has been provided by the American architectural firm of Moore Ruble Yudell under the direction of Irish-born Architect James Mary O&#x27;Connor. The surrounding community is an equal stakeholder in the project and receives technical support from the Grangegorman Community Forum. On July 17, 2012, The Grangegorman Development Agency was awarded funding from the Irish Government as a part of a €2.5billion stimulus package for the country.

===Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) Grangegorman Campus===

The first construction work to take place as part of the new DIT campus started in 2013 with the extensive refurbishment of several listed buildings. These accommodate 1,400 staff and students, who moved in 2014. A further 10,000 staff and students will move by 2017 into two major quads which are being built as public private partnerships. When fully completed Grangegorman will accommodate over 20,000 staff and students and for the first time all DIT activities, currently in 39 buildings, will be located on one integrated campus.
September 2014 saw 1000 students from Art, Design, Photography, Social Sciences and Visual Communication move onto campus.
===Transport Links===
Stops named &#x27;Grangegorman&#x27; and &#x27;Broadstone-University&#x27; on the LUAS green line link the campus to other parts of the city centre and to Broombridge railway station.

===HSE Facilities===
The new replacement facility for St. Brendans Hospital, the Phoenix Care Centre, was opened 1 March 2013. A new primary care centre has been in operation since January 2018.

==St. Brendan&#x27;s Hospital==

Officially opened in 1815, although it received its first patients in 1814, the Richmond Lunatic Asylum was initially created as a national institution for the reception of recoverable lunatics. On the 30 July 1830 the asylum was incorporated into the national system of district asylums and was renamed the Richmond Lunatic District Asylum. Under the district asylum system it received patients resident in the city and county of Dublin and the counties of Louth, Meath, Wicklow and the town of Drogheda. On 19 May 1921 its name was changed to the Grangegorman Mental Hospital. On 17 April 1958 its name was changed to St. Brendan&#x27;s Hospital, which it retains to this day.

Although the original building of the Richmond Lunatic Asylum has now been largely destroyed, a new state of the art &quot;Phoenix Care Centre&quot;, comprising 54 bedrooms and ensuites, recreational rooms, clinical rooms, administration areas, seclusion rooms and therapy gardens, opened in March 2013.

<doc id="882285" wikidata="Q193019" url="?curid=882285" title="Juiz de Fora">
<text>Juiz de Fora (; ), also known as J.F., is a city in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, approximately from the state border with Rio de Janeiro. According to the 2022 census the current population is 540,756 inhabitants. The geographical area of the municipality is .

The city&#x27;s location was a key factor in its economic and demographic development since it is situated between the three most important financial and economic metropolises of southeast Brazil (and also the three largest urban sprawls of the country): Rio de Janeiro (), Belo Horizonte () and São Paulo (). Major highways connect Juiz de Fora with these three metropolitan areas, the most important being the BR 040 which connects Brasília with Rio de Janeiro via Belo Horizonte. The city is built on the Paraibuna, a major tributary of the Paraíba do Sul river.

==History==
The origins of Juiz de Fora can be traced back to the beginnings of the 18th century, when the Caminho Novo (&quot;New Way&quot;) road was opened linking Rio de Janeiro to the gold rush area of Minas Gerais around Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto). The region was covered with dense forest (hence its name; &quot;Zona da Mata&quot;, &quot;Forest Zone&quot;). Despite the opening of the new route the area remained largely uninhabited and most of its scarce settlement was centered on the road itself. The first permanent inhabitants of the municipality were merchants and farmers who supplied the travelers&#x27; needs on the long road between the coast and the gold region.

Further development would only take place after the decline of gold mining in the central zone of Minas Gerais. The capital previously invested in the mines was now invested in coffee plantations, and the region of Zona da Mata became a fertile ground to invest in. The position of the village then called Santo Antônio do Paraibuna was favourable due to the road connection with the capital of the country and its harbour.

In 1850 the small village was officially elevated to city status. Progress continued in 1861 with the completion of the first macadamized road in Latin America, the Estrada União e Indústria (Union and Industry), replacing the Caminho Novo. Its name reflected the newfound wealth of the city, for industry replaced coffee-related agriculture as its economic heart. Five years later a new railway, the Estrada de Ferro Dom Pedro II, reached the city and in 1889 the first hydroelectric powerplant of Latin America (Marmelos Zero) was built on the Paraibuna river on the outskirts of the city along the Estrada União e Indústria.

As both foreign and domestic capital fueled the industrial boom the city became a major centre (becoming the largest urban area of the state). By first decade of the 20th century Juiz de Fora was among the main textile and industrial producers in South America and in Brazil particularly. The city&#x27;s wealth was second only to major cities such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. But as the coffee rush frontier moved southwestwards it reached the state of São Paulo and its immensely fertile plateaus which became the richest in the federation and industry flourished there as it had in Juiz de Fora itself. The city of Juiz de Fora became the major industrial centre in a state that was being much surpassed by São Paulo in industrial output, and worse still much of the wealth generated by the state (a large bulk by Juiz de Fora itself) was being used in the building of the new state capital Belo Horizonte (replacing Ouro Preto at the centre of the gold region), founded at the end of the 19th century and which, in the Brazilian and Latin-American tradition of centralization, was intended to be the largest city of the state. The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the city&#x27;s decay which would only be overcome five decades later. By the 1940s the city had lost its nationwide influence due to the continued growth of Belo Horizonte and the loss of industry.

The city&#x27;s decay can be seen in the figures for its population which remained stagnant from the early 1930s to the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, the city started to experience new growth, which continues to this day. This new era began with the establishment of a federal university (UFJF) in the city and the decision by the Brazilian military junta (1964–1985) to promote the city as a major military centre. This sparked a phenomenon rarely experienced by post-industrial towns: the industrial rebirth of the city, this time following Brazilian industrialization itself, based on heavy-industry such as steel and engineering.

Recently, the city seems to be experiencing a new era in its history, again following a boom in Brazilian economy, and is reinventing itself as a major centre for services (such as telecommunications, with an important call centre) and education (following the federal university, private colleges have been established in the city).

Today Juiz de Fora is an important commercial centre for the surrounding region and is the core of an unofficial metropolitan area of more than 1 million inhabitants.

==Geography==
According to the modern (2017) geographic classification by Brazil&#x27;s National Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the city is the main municipality in the Intermediate Geographic Region of Juiz de Fora.

===Location===

Juiz de Fora is located in southeast of Minas Gerais state. It is in a strategic location close to the important metropolitan areas of Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and São Paulo and on the main route from Rio de Janeiro to Belo Horizonte and Brasília. The distance of Juiz de Fora to important cities is: 
*Rio de Janeiro: 
*Belo Horizonte: 
*São Paulo: 
*Vitória: 
*Brasília: 

===Climate===
Although lying within tropical latitudes the climate is relatively mild. The altitude of makes the weather usually cooler and rainier than the lower surrounding areas.
Under the Köppen climate classification Juiz de Fora&#x27;s climate is classified as a humid subtropical climate with two distinct seasons, one hotter and rainier (October to April) and one cooler and drier (May to September). The average annual temperature is around with an average high of and an average low of . It is very humid with average humidity of 80%. The annual rainfall varies between .

==Economy==

Juiz de Fora is the third most important industrial center in the state of Minas Gerais, despite being the fourth largest in terms of population. It was once the state&#x27;s largest city, a position which was held up until the beginning of the 20th century (it held the second position until the 1980s). There are important steel mills and automotive factories (Mercedes-Benz being the most famous) in the city, along with several textile factories.

The city is also an important trade center with a considerable area of influence, being considered the capital of the Zona da Mata region of the state. It has four big shopping malls, several hyper-marts and many smaller shops.

The massive presence of immigrants – especially from Portugal, Italy, Germany, Syria and Lebanon and more recently China – throughout its history has given the city a cosmopolitan spirit and diverse cuisine. Walking down Rio Branco Avenue, (the city&#x27;s several kilometers long main avenue) one can find typical German, Italian, Arabic, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese restaurants, as well as traditional Brazilian and vegetarian cuisine.

Juiz de Fora is an important regional cultural center, one of the few towns in south-east Minas Gerais to have permanently functional cinemas, theatres, music venues and light entertainment. There is a nationally important museum (Museu Mariano Procópio) and a Philharmonic Orchestra (Orquestra Filarmônica Pró-Musica). The city also hosts a yearly classical music festival, the Festival Internacional de Música Brasileira Colonial e Música Antiga (International Festival of Brazilian Colonial Music and Early Music). It is home to the &quot;Meninos Cantores da Academia&quot; the second oldest choir in this category in Brazil and to the Coral Universitário da Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora an eclectic and neat choir with a remarkable musical legacy of 50 years in the city. Cultural life is also boosted by many cinema, gastronomic and rock festivals like: &quot;Primeiro Plano Juiz de fora Cinema Festival&quot;, &quot;JF Sabor&quot;, &quot;Deutsches Fest&quot; (The festival celebrates and preserves the cultural customs, the gastronomy and everything related to the German traditions. In 2018, the party celebrated 160 years of the German immigration to Juiz de Fora), &quot;Comida di Buteco JF&quot; and &quot;Festival de Bandas Novas&quot;. The rock festival has been supporting the local music scene and promoting countless new bands since 1999.

The Federal University and several private-owned colleges in Juiz de Fora turn it in a highly sought destination for students. Some of the courses at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora are reputedly among the best in Brazil, considered the second best university in the state of Minas Gerais and 14th position among Brazilian universities according to international ranking in 2018. The cultural life of Juiz de Fora is marked by great eclecticism, which can be seen in its architecture. Art Nouveau buildings dating from the first decade of the 20th century are intermingled with those in Art Deco style from the mid-20th century, and many modern concrete edifices including one building by Oscar Niemeyer.

==Sport==
===Football===
Juiz de Fora is the home of Tupi and Tupynambás. Tupi was the 1932 runner-up of Campeonato Mineiro, and has won several city championships. Tupi won the Campeonato Mineiro Módulo II in 2001, was 3rd place in 2008 Campeonato Mineiro and won Taça Minas Gerais in 2008. It is widely regarded as one of the most important teams of the state, despite lacking national prestige. They won the 2011 Campeonato Brasileiro Série D (national fourth division) after beating Santa Cruz in both legs of the final, having qualified for the tournament after América de Teófilo Otoni withdrew before the start of the competition. In 2015, they finished 3rd place at the 2015 Campeonato Brasileiro Série C, achieving promotion for the Brazilian second tier for the first time in the team history. However, they finished 18th in the 2016 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B and was relegated back to Série C. After missing promotion in the final stage in 2017, the next year saw Tupi relegated to Série D due to goal difference.

Meanwhile, after the 60s, Tupynambás had sporadically played at Campeonato Mineiro Módulo II with their football department closed most of the years. They returned to professional football in 2016 after receiving a percentage fee from sale of Danilo, who started his youth career at the club, from Porto to Real Madrid and were promoted from the third division of Campeonato Mineiro in the same year. In 2018, Tupynambás finished in 2nd place at the second division of Campeonato Mineiro, earning promotion to the 2019 Campeonato Mineiro.

In 2019, with both teams together in Minas Gerais first division since 1970, Tupi had a disappointing campaign after failing to win a single match and being relegated after finishing in the last place; meanwhile Tupynambás won their first match by 5–1 against Villa Nova, defeated their city rivals in the second match by 1-0 and finished in the 8th place, being beaten by Atlético Mineiro in the quarter-finals.

<text>Project Vela was a United States Department of Defense project to monitor Soviet Union compliance with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty. The treaty banned the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater, but permitted underground testing.

==Early history==
In August 1959, several groups focused on detecting underground nuclear tests were established within the US Department of Defense; on September 2, 1959, the Secretary of Defense assigned the research responsibilities to the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This initial assignment involved seven tasks: creating a worldwide network of standardized seismological stations; conduct research relating to underground test detection, and on seismic detection stations; conduct nuclear and chemical underground tests to expand knowledge of seismic signatures; and three tasks of a more administrative nature. From the beginning, however, and through 1960, ARPA pressed to add research for testing surface-based, atmospheric, and outer-space detonations, and advocated satellites as a potential platform for such detections.

The Vela Project started as a small budget research program within the DARPA Projects Agencies until 1961 when it was granted greater funding and resources through the authority of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army. This was likely prompted by increased caution over Domestic Nuclear Affairs resulting from the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash as well as in anticipation of the 1963 PTB Treaty.

The initial project was limited to the development of the Vela Satellites, but was later expanded and reorganized into three distinct levels of monitoring: 

# Vela Uniform, which was the portion of the project dedicated towards monitoring seismic signals, in order to detect underground and underwater nuclear testing
# Vela Hotel, which was a continuation of the satellite program to detect nuclear testing solely beyond the atmosphere at an extended range 
# Vela Sierra, which was a set of advanced satellites that were designed to detect testing both in the close reaches of outer space and within the atmosphere of the planet itself. 

The project&#x27;s space and atmospheric divisions operated until the emplacement of satellites in the Defense Support Program (DSP), and were later integrated into the Global Positioning System set of satellites. Currently, all satellites under Project Vela are under the management of IONDS. The seismic division of Project Vela remains in activity today.

In 2020, &quot;National Security Science&quot; magazine featured an article on Project Vela titled &quot;Cold War watchmen&quot; that contained a description of the project history focusing on the contributions made at Los Alamos National Laboratory, as well as commentary from scientists that worked on the project. In the article astrophysicist Ed Fenimore states &quot;Vela was the prototypical project that made Los Alamos the premier scientific national security laboratory in the world.&quot; Data from Project Vela is still used for national security work, and sensors, such as those developed in the project, are still an important part of nuclear detonation detection. 

== Vela Hotel and the Initial Vela Project ==

There is very little documentation which directly addresses the topic of the initial Vela Project due to its low funding, staffing, resources and status of priority. The first sensor package sent into space, labelled the &quot;Vela Hotel&quot; experiment, was launched aboard the Ranger 1 lunar probe in August of 1961 and returned useful data. It is known that the majority of the work done on the initial Vela Project was implemented into Vela Hotel, which monitored outer space for nuclear tests. The Vela Hotel satellite program was primarily developed at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, under the supervision of the United States Air Force. A system of X-ray, Neutron, and Gamma-Ray detection monitored for nuclear testing beyond the atmosphere. 

The satellites&#x27; instrumentation count included 12 X-ray detectors, 18 internal Neutron and Gamma-ray detectors, data transmission equipment to send the information back to Earth, and a set of solar panels which generated 90 watts to power the instrumentation on each satellite. Six of the Vela Hotel series satellites were manufactured, each with a design life of six months, and they were launched a week after the PTB Treaty on October 17, 1963. After deployment these satellites remained operational and online for 5 years before being shut down.

The Vela Hotel series of satellites never detected any weapons being tested in outer space, but they did provide the scientific community with valuable data regarding the mechanics of the solar system. Importantly, this series of satellites was responsible for discovering Gamma-Ray Bursts, markers of collapsing stars and black holes which are now recognized as the most violent events in the universe. The discovery of Gamma-Ray Bursts enabled scientists with unprecedented ability to map the universe as they augmented existing methods of measuring light to identify deep space objects.

== Vela Sierra and the Advanced Vela Series ==

After the completion of development on the first set of Vela Satellites in the Hotel series, DARPA began work on the next phase of the Vela satellite program, namely, on Vela Sierra, which was intended to monitor the atmosphere for covert nuclear tests. Following the deployment of the Hotel series, Los Alamos resumed development on the satellites, this time working towards the Advanced Vela series. These new satellites were created with the intention that they would replace the Hotel Series, as well as function as the satellites that would complete the objectives of the Vela Sierra subset.

The new set of Advanced Vela satellites were equipped with the same detection equipment as the Hotel series, those being the 12 X-ray detectors and 18 internal Neutron and Gamma-Ray detectors, but were also equipped with a new set of instruments. The Advanced Vela series came equipped with two non-imaging photodiode sensors called bhangmeters. These measured light levels over sub-millisecond intervals, and could detect a nuclear explosion to within 3,000 miles. This addition was necessary due to the singular effects that atmospheric nuclear explosions produce, called either the &quot;Double Flash&quot; or the &quot;Double-Humped Curve&quot;, which is a pair of flashes of light caused by an explosion, one lasting a millisecond which is quite intense and bright, the other far more prolonged and less intense. This &quot;Double Flash&quot; is what distinguishes atmospheric nuclear explosions from other kinds of explosions in the atmosphere, along with radiation, since the only feasible event that could theoretically produce a double event like an atmospheric nuclear explosion would be something incredibly rare like a meteoroid generated lightning superbolt. However, radiation in the atmosphere is far less easy to calculate, as the Van Allen radiation belts can mask radioactive wavelengths and signatures. The Advanced Vela satellites were additionally fitted with larger solar panels, since the new design required 120 watts as opposed to the Hotel series&#x27; 90 watts, as well as electromagnetic sensors for detecting an electromagnetic pulse from an in-atmosphere detonation. The new set of satellites had a design life of 18 months, but instead lasted on average 7 years, with the longest lasting of the set (Vehicle 9) being shut down in 1984, lasting around 15 years before being shut down.

Vela Sierra&#x27;s most famous actual event was the &quot;Double Flash&quot; detected on September 22, 1979, by Vela satellite 6911 near the Prince Edward Islands. However, due to the lack of any corroborating evidence that a bomb ever went off in the area other than the readings the satellite provided, it is widely regarded as either a malfunction or a magnetospheric event affecting the instruments aboard the satellite. At the time of the event, President Jimmy Carter deemed the event evidence of a joint Israeli-South African nuclear test, though since then no evidence has been uncovered to corroborate whether that is true or untrue.

== Vela Uniform ==
Vela Uniform was the second half of Project Vela that began its development soon after the PTB Treaty was put into effect. Vela Uniform was created with the intention of monitoring seismic activity in order to determine the magnitude and location of any covert nuclear weapons tests beneath the surface of the earth. Underground tests have been illegal under international law since the widespread ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Vela Uniform can also detect underwater tests conducted at any point on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The methods DARPA used to create a system with which they could determine the difference between a regular seismic event and an underground covert nuclear test involved the rigorous measurement of seven nuclear tests in the continental United States, as well as numerous smaller experiments using conventional high explosives rather than nuclear explosions.

Over time, Vela Uniform&#x27;s methods and techniques for measuring seismic activity to determine the existence and location of covert underground nuclear tests have improved, and stations for seismographical monitoring exist all around the world. This has had the effect of giving more nations the ability to better understand their own country&#x27;s seismic activities, and has given more and more countries access to aid in situations of earthquakes, tsunamis, and other such events, as well as ensuring the detection of any future covert underground nuclear tests.

<text>Kaplan, Inc. is an international educational services company that provides educational and training services to colleges, universities, businesses and individuals around the world. Founded in 1938 by Stanley Kaplan, the company offers a variety of test preparation, certifications, and student support services. The company is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Graham Holdings Company.

==History==
Kaplan, Inc. was founded in 1938 by Stanley H. Kaplan, a first-generation son of immigrants who began tutoring his classmates at age 14, operating from the basement of his parents&#x27; Brooklyn home. He originally aspired to be a doctor, but was rejected from all medical schools he applied to, despite his exceptional academic record, because of anti-Semitic admissions policies at the time. When a student introduced him to the SAT, he wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Test Pilot&quot;, that he fell in love with the test, as it tested skills he knew how to teach. His business grew as many students sought help in preparing for college admission tests, particularly after World War II when U.S. government passed the G.I. Bill giving education to returning veterans. His business boomed, and he expanded it across the U.S. and abroad. In 1984, Kaplan sold the company to The Washington Post Company, now the Graham Holdings Company.

===1990s–present===
In 1990s, the company expanded abroad and grew beyond test preparation, expanding its training and publishing businesses, diversifying into English language training, higher education, pathways programs, online learning and other services. It launched the first online law school, Concord Law School, in 1998. Over the years, it has purchased several other educational companies and schools worldwide, expanding its operations and delivery of courses and programs in markets beyond North America including the UK, Ireland, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. The company&#x27;s leader during this expansion period was Jonathan Grayer.

In 2003, Kaplan acquired the Financial Training Company, an established provider of financial services training in the UK, with operations in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. Later that year, the company&#x27;s acquisition of Dublin Business School in Ireland launched its entry into Europe&#x27;s private college market.

Kaplan expanded its private education offerings and global reach in 2005 with the acquisition of Asia Pacific Management Institute, a Singapore-based business school (later renamed to Kaplan Singapore). In 2005 Kaplan also expanded into international student pathways programs, partnering with Nottingham Trent University to set up Nottingham Trent International College, created to prepare students for university enrollment through English language training and academic preparation for A-level standards.

In 2006, Kaplan expanded its English language business with the acquisition of Aspect Education, a global languages school with schools in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the US.

In 2016, Kaplan partnered with ACT, the ACT college admissions test maker, to make low-cost, online test prep free for low-income students.

In 2017, Purdue University announced the acquisition of Kaplan University, and the sale was completed in 2018. The new institution became Purdue University Global, providing students with accredited distance learning worldwide.

In 2018, as part of an effort to overhaul UK legal education and create a common standard for professional qualification, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) selected Kaplan to develop and deliver the Solicitors Qualifying Exam (SQE). Introduced in September 2021, the exam is the qualifying assessment for professionals seeking to become solicitors in England or Wales.

During the pandemic in 2020, Kaplan partnered with Hexco Academic to host its first national online spelling bee. The winner of the Kaplan Online Spelling Bee, Zaila Avant-garde, went on to become the first African American to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 2021. Runner up Harini Logan went on to win the Scripps Bee the following year.

In 2021, Kaplan launched Career Core, a shared career services model, in partnership with Wake Forest University, Adelphi University, Florida International University, Point Loma Nazarene University, University of Arizona, University of Montana, Alpha Tau Omega, and Kappa Alpha Order.

In 2022, Amazon announced a partnership with Kaplan to make academic and career coaching services available to its 750,000 hourly employees in the U.S. as part of its Career Choice upskilling program.

===Controversies===
In 2007, a class-action lawsuit was settled for $30 million by Kaplan and BarBri, a company offering bar exam preparation. Among the allegations was a federal antitrust violation claiming that Kaplan had agreed not to compete in the bar review business while BarBri agreed it would not compete in the LSAT business. Both West Publishing Company (parent of BarBri) and Kaplan denied the allegations and the matter was resolved without any findings of wrongdoing.

In a 2010 investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found deceptive practices at 15 for-profit college campuses, including two owned by Kaplan. Footage from undercover videos revealed that recruiters from Kaplan in California and Florida had made false or dubious claims to prospective students, such as suggesting massage therapists earn $100 per hour and that student loans do not have to be repaid. Kaplan took steps to address these failures, including firing those responsible, halting recruiting, offering full tuition rebates, retraining individuals, bringing in outside accountants to conduct its own &quot;mystery shopping&quot;, and implementing a debt-free trial period.

In 2011, a federal judge in Miami has refused to dismiss the lawsuits filed by former employees of Kaplan University and Kaplan Higher Education Corp, who allege that the companies have violated the Higher Education Act in order to gain federal funding and profits. Judge Patricia A. Seitz has denied the accusations related to Kaplan&#x27;s manipulation of students&#x27; academic records and job-placement statistics, or their incentive payments based on student enrollment numbers. However, she has allowed the whistleblowers to continue to pursue claims of retaliation and other violations. Since 2006, several ex-employees alleged that Kaplan had broken the law and breached its agreement with the U.S. Department of Education by recruiting unqualified students, misleading students about their academic progress, manipulating job placement statistics, and offering bonuses to recruiters based on how many students they enrolled, in order to get the most out of federal funding. In November 2006, two former instructors sued Kaplan for allegedly submitting false claims to the government and not adhering to the Higher Education Act&#x27;s requirements for payment. The plaintiffs, who were previously employed at Kaplan&#x27;s Pittsburgh-based campus, claimed that Kaplan had breached the 70 Percent Rule, which requires eligible schools to have a minimum graduation rate and job placement rate of 70%. Furthermore, they argued that Kaplan Career Institute had advertised job-placement rates without providing prospective students with job-placement statistics or state licensing requirements.

In 2012, the North Carolina Attorney General determined that Kaplan had lied to students about the credentials they would earn in the Dental Assistant program. Following the investigation Kaplan College Charlotte campus surrendered its license to operate a school. Kaplan refunded students the cost of tuition, books, and fees, and agreed to pay the program&#x27;s graduates $9,000 stipends. Students claimed they were told the school would soon obtain ADA accreditation. The program had never been accredited by the American Dental Association, and had never been scheduled for the initial site visit required for accreditation.

In 2010, the Florida Attorney General started an investigation into whether five for-profit colleges, including Kaplan, violated Florida&#x27;s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act by making misleading statements, misrepresentations, and omitting or failed to disclose material information related to market their programs and schools. In 2014, Kaplan agreed to voluntarily comply with the Attorney General and made several required changes as part of the settlement. Kaplan agreed to &quot;clearly and conspicuously disclose true and accurate information relating to the school&#x27;s accreditation, program costs, financial aid, and the scope and nature of employment services they provide.&quot; During the course of the investigation Kaplan waived $6 million in tuition and fees for more than 2,400 Florida students, and reimbursed the Florida Attorney General&#x27;s office for attorney costs, while impacted students were offered retraining or a separate arbitration process.

In 2015, Kaplan paid $1.375 million to the Massachusetts Attorney General&#x27;s office to resolve complaints that Kaplan engaged in &quot;unfair or deceptive practices designed to induce enrollment of students&quot; including &quot;harassing sales tactics and false and misleading representations&quot; in the operation of the Kaplan Career Institute campus in Boston, Massachusetts. Also in 2015, Kaplan paid $1.3 million, with $1 million going toward tuition refunds to 289 students, to resolve allegations that it hired instructors who were not qualified. The United States Department of Justice began investigating Kaplan following a Qui tam suit filed by a whistleblower under the False Claims Act. The whistleblower alleged Kaplan employed unqualified instructors to teach Medical Assistant courses at its San Antonio campuses and knowingly requested, received, and retained federal funds for courses taught by individuals who did not meet the minimum requirements established by Texas law.

Durbin Jr. stated that the settlement was not an admission of liability by Kaplan or its affiliates, and that the company had fully cooperated with the government&#x27;s investigation and negotiated the settlement in good faith.

==Kaplan Educational Foundation (KEF)==
The Kaplan Educational Foundation (KEF) is an independent 501(c)(3) charity that offers undergraduate and graduate educational scholarship opportunities and other assistance to community college students in the New York City area who are traditionally overlooked, underserved and underrepresented, including African American, Latino, and Native American students. KEF&#x27;s Kaplan Leadership Program helps high-potential, low-income community college students from underrepresented communities complete their associate degrees and successfully transfer to the nation&#x27;s most highly selective schools. Kaplan scholars receive a comprehensive array of financial and academic support, transfer admissions advising, and leadership skills development. The foundation partners with dozens of higher educational institutions around the United States. Since its inception in 2006, the Kaplan Leadership Program has helped more than 100 Scholars gain admission to the country&#x27;s most competitive schools, including Yale, Stanford, Brown, Amherst, Cornell, Mount Holyoke, Smith and many others.

The foundation&#x27;s executive director, Nolvia Delgado, is a former Kaplan Leadership Program scholar, Borough of Manhattan Community College graduate and alumna of Smith College.

In addition to support from its partners and benefactors, the foundation is supported through an endowment fund. The foundation also publishes a guide to college transfer. The guide profiles top U.S. schools and their transfer policies, and is a resource for students and school administrators to navigate the complex transfer process, including credits and graduation requirements. The guide provides specialized advice to non-traditional students, including veterans, students raising families, and students with unique immigration needs. Private citizens may donate these guides to deserving students, and all proceeds from sales are used to support the foundation.

<doc id="882293" wikidata="Q7636467" url="?curid=882293" title="Sully Island">
<text>Sully Island () is a small tidal island of by the hamlet of Swanbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. It is located off the northern coast of the Bristol Channel, midway between the towns of Penarth and Barry and south of the Welsh capital city of Cardiff. It is part of the parish of Sully, after which it is named, and is registered as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Sully island is one of 43 unbridged tidal islands that can be reached on foot from the mainland of Great Britain.

Access to the island is on foot at low tide from the car park of the Captain&#x27;s Wife pub. A rocky causeway connecting the island to the mainland is uncovered for approximately 3 hours either side of low tide, the island being cut off from the mainland for the rest of the day. A tide table is displayed to indicate when it is safe to cross.

During the 13th century, the island was the base for Alfredo de Marisco, a Norman pirate known locally as the Night Hawk. In the Middle Ages the island was well known for its involvement in the local smuggling trade.

==History==

===Origins===
There is evidence that the island was frequently visited by both Romans and Vikings. There is also archeological evidence for remains of a Saxon multivallate promontory fort occupying the eastern end of the Island, on the summit of which is a Bronze Age barrow. It has been suggested by some that this was an armed stronghold, but it was more likely to have been a defended residence and farm homestead.

===Port of Swanbridge===
Swanbridge and the waterfront protected by Sully Island had been used as a commercial harbour and port for several hundred years, although there is no sign of this today. Cargo arrived and departed via the St Mary&#x27;s Well Bay Road, which is now blocked off to through traffic, en route for the traditional market at Canton Cross in Cardiff. As late as the early 1970s, the harbour&#x27;s iron mooring rings could still be seen at the eastern end of the bay.

During the 16th century several historical records show that the trader masters were supposed to pay an import duty to local officials, but many attempted to avoid the payments by smuggling the cargoes ashore. In 1569 court records show that the harbour official seized contraband consisting of of cheese and eighty barrels of butter arriving illegally at Swanbridge. In 1658 the harbour was being used as a landing place for illegal immigrants, described at the time as &quot;undesirables&quot;.

A small fleet of fishing vessels were located at Swanbridge harbour and it is likely that the row of cottages, that were converted during 1976 and 1977 into the &quot;Captain&#x27;s Wife&quot; pub, were the traditional homes of the local fishermen and their families.

====SY Scotia====
Owing to the tricky tides and narrow access, many ships have sunk in the vicinity of the island. Several sources record that the famous Antarctic survey vessel, the , was wrecked on the island during 18 January 1916. Local children from as far away as Barry went to Swanbridge with sacks to collect coal spilled on the foreshore from the wreck, over several weeks. There is a skeleton of a wreck still visible on the island&#x27;s north foreshore facing Swanbridge, but this vessel&#x27;s keel is too short to have been the Scotia.

The survey ship that the oceanographer William Speirs Bruce used on the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, 1902–04, was originally a sealer named &quot;Hekla&quot;, built in Norway in 1872. In 1889 the Norwegian skipper Ragnvald Knudsen explored the northeast coast of Greenland between latitudes 74° and 75°, and in 1891–92 the ship was used by the Danish naval officer, Lieutenant C. Ryder, to explore the inner recesses of Scoresby Sund, finally visiting Angmagssalik.

In 1902, renamed Survey Yacht &quot;Scotia&quot; and captained by Tam Robertson from Peterhead, she sailed to the Weddell Sea under the leadership of Bruce. The southern winter of 1903 was spent at Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands, and in March–April 1904 the party discovered of previously unknown coastline of the Antarctic continent, reaching a farthest south of 74°01′S, 22°00′W. An extensive programme of marine survey and biological research was carried out. Back in the UK, Bruce sold the ship, and she returned to sealing, based in Dundee until appointed to be the first international North Atlantic ice patrol ship after the tragedy of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. The Great War caused her to become a freighter in the English Channel area until she caught fire and was burnt out on Sully Island.

===20th century===
From 1890 until the end of the 1960s, Swanbridge was connected northward to Penarth and Cardiff and westward to Barry and the South Wales Valleys by an extension of the Taff Vale Railway line. The coastal spur was closed under the Beeching cuts in 1968. Swanbridge railway station near the main Lavernock Road junction was closed and is now overgrown with weeds and brambles. The redundant rail track bed has mostly been sold into private ownership and built on, with any unsold stretches being overgrown and impassable as far as the Fort Road bridge at Lavernock. Between Lavernock and Penarth the track bed is a rural greenway and cycle track.

When the rail link arrived at the start of the 20th century, the bays of Swanbridge, St Mary&#x27;s Well and Lavernock became popular summer time destination for day trippers from Cardiff, Penarth and the South Wales Valleys, particularly at weekends and on bank holidays. For nearly a hundred years there was a busy and profitable cafe and ice cream parlour, located at the St Mary&#x27;s Well Bay end of the Swanbridge carpark, that was closed and demolished around 1970 when the through road was blocked off to traffic.

Watercolour artist Thomas Frederick Worrall, who lived in Barry from 1913, painted many views of the island.

==Flora and fauna==
The noted British biologist Brian J. Ford used to live and write at Swanbridge and explored Sully Island frequently. He also carried out extensive ecological studies, while surveying and mapping both the island and the foreshore. Ford recorded many plants unusual for the area, including the bee orchid, the marine spleenwort and the adder&#x27;s tongue fern.

The island once supported a vast colony of rabbits. When the disease myxomatosis arrived in Britain during 1953, the mainland population of rabbits was quickly decimated. Mostly because of its remoteness from the mainland the Sully Island, rabbits survived for many years until the disease finally arrived on the island, some suspect through human agency. From time to time new rabbit colonies set up home on Sully Island, but at nowhere near the early 1950s levels.

The waters around Sully Island are fished for species such as cod, whiting, pouting, dogfish, conger eel and bass.

Any trees that grew on the island have been long cut down and even scrubby bushes struggle to gain a foothold on the sandy and loamy surface. Most of the island is covered with a coarse grass. A damp central depression on the island supports a reed bed about in extent.

==Geology==

The sea cliff exposures of Sully Island provide an excellent insight into the environment of the area in Triassic times, approximately 200 million years ago. Red mudstones, sandstones and breccias (rocks made from angular pebbles) indicate that this area was a beach situated on the margin between steep semi-desert land and a large shallow lake or marine lagoon. These Triassic rocks were deposited on top of much older Carboniferous Limestone which can be seen at the base of the cliffs.

==Recent history==
In 1985 the Vale of Glamorgan Council refused an application for outline planning permission for a Health and Holiday Hydro facility on Sully Island.

In July 2011, the island was marketed for sale by a firm of local chartered surveyors, Cooke &amp; Arkwright. The island was advertised as comprising . An initial guide price of £1.25 million was reduced to just £95,000, due to lack of interest. A grassroots campaign, &quot;Save Sully Island&quot;, attempted to raise the purchase price but failed. However, a mystery buyer stepped in at the last minute with a bid well in excess of the guide price. The buyer, a sailor, had contributed to the grassroots campaign, and promised to keep the island open to the public.

<doc id="882301" wikidata="Q1691335" url="?curid=882301" title="Joe Bellino">
<text>Joseph Michael Bellino (March 13, 1938 – March 27, 2019) was an American professional football player who was a halfback in the American Football League (AFL) for the Boston Patriots. He played college football for the Navy Midshipmen, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1960. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977.

==Early life==
Bellino was born in Winchester, Massachusetts, attended the town&#x27;s public schools, and was a three-sport star at Winchester High School. In baseball he batted well over .400 and was courted by major league teams. He was offered a contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates after high school.

The basketball team on which he starred won the state championship his sophomore and junior years. They moved up to the Class A (largest schools) tournament his senior year, where the team&#x27;s 55-game winning streak came to an end at the hands of much larger B.M.C. Durfee High School of Fall River.

He was a dominant halfback on Winchester&#x27;s outstanding football team, although his senior season was shortened by the 1955 polio epidemic. He was recruited by several Big Ten schools, Notre Dame, Ivy League schools as well as the U.S. Military Academy, but his first choice all along was Navy.

==College career==
During his 1956–57 year at Columbian Prep in Washington, D.C., Bellino starred in both football and basketball. On November 25, Bellino scored three touchdowns in Columbian&#x27;s upset win over the Navy Plebes, 34–33.

In the fall of 1957, Bellino entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, along with his former high-school teammate, Frank Dattilo. During his freshman year, the Plebes matched up against the Penn State freshmen. Penn State won the game 23–13, but Bellino took a lateral from his Columbian teammate Harry Dietz and scored on an 85-yard kickoff return.

He was an outstanding baseball player at Navy, but his legendary exploits occurred on the football field. In his senior year, he rushed for 834 yards, caught 15 passes for 264 yards and three touchdowns, threw two touchdown passes, averaged 47.1 yards as a punter, and returned kicks and punts. He won the 1960 Heisman Trophy by a wide margin, garnering the most votes in each of the five national voting regions. In Bellino&#x27;s final college football game, Navy&#x27;s loss to the University of Missouri in the 1961 Orange Bowl, he scored his team&#x27;s final touchdown with a spectacular diving catch in the end zone.

Following graduation, Ensign Bellino began his four years of active Navy service, until he was discharged to reserve duty.

==Professional career==
Bellino was selected in 17th round of the 1961 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins, as well as in the 19th round of the 1961 AFL Draft by the Boston Patriots. He decided to join the Patriots of the American Football League, and played three seasons, primarily as a kick returner. Due to his five-year commitment to the U.S. Navy following graduation, he remains the lowest drafted Heisman Trophy winner in the history of the National Football League (NFL).

Bellino also played for the Providence Steamrollers semi-pro team in Providence, Rhode Island.

Bellino is the only past Heisman Trophy winning running back to have played for the Patriots. He caught a 15-yard pass from past Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte in the Patriots 38–14 rout of the Houston Oilers on December 11, 1966. Bellino caught a deflected pass on his back that allowed the Patriots to continue a drive that resulted in a touchdown in their 14–3 win over the Buffalo Bills in &quot;The Game&quot; at Fenway Park on December 4, 1966.

He had the Patriots longest kickoff return in 1966 and caught a 25-yard TD pass in the Patriots 20–10 win over the Buffalo Bills at War Memorial Stadium on October 8, 1966.

Bellino was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 1968 AFL expansion draft.

==After football==
Bellino served a total of 28 years in the United States Navy and the Naval Reserve, and retired with the rank of captain.

After the close of his playing career, he was a successful businessman in the Boston area, where he was also active in charitable organizations. He and his wife, Ann Tansey, had two children, Therese and John, and lived in Bedford, Massachusetts.

In 1976 Bellino also coached Saint Columbkille, a small Catholic school. In 1991, he was the first inductee into his high school&#x27;s Winchester Sports Foundation Hall of Fame. Bellino Park in Winchester was dedicated in his honor in November 2004.

Bellino died on March 27, 2019, at the age of 81. Since the start of the team&#x27;s 2019 season, Bellino&#x27;s #27 jersey number is painted upon the field at each 27 yard line of Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in memoriam.

<doc id="882305" wikidata="Q5302175" url="?curid=882305" title="Douglass Houghton">
<text>Douglass Houghton (September 21, 1809 – October 13, 1845) was an American geologist and physician, primarily known for his exploration of the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan. It was the site of a copper boom and extensive copper mining beginning in the 19th century. He was appointed in 1839 as the first state geologist of Michigan, after it was admitted to the union, and served in that position for the rest of his life.

==Early life and education==
Douglass Houghton was born in Troy, New York, the son of Jacob Houghton, a lawyer and later a county judge, and Mary Lydia (Douglass). Raised in a close-knit, cultured home in Fredonia, New York, Douglass was a small person with a nervous, active temperament inclined toward the practical and scientific. He exhibited early his lifelong interest in the natural world. In spite of a slight speech impediment and facial scarring from a youthful experiment with gunpowder, he was at ease with all levels of society.

In 1829 Houghton entered the Rensselaer School in Troy, where, under the direction of Amos Eaton, scientific training was emphasized, particularly in geology. That same year he received both the bachelor&#x27;s degree and a teaching appointment in chemistry and natural history at the school. He also studied medicine with a doctor friend of his family, and in 1831 received a license to practice.

==Career==
In 1830 the city fathers of Detroit consulted with Eaton about their search for a public lecturer on science; he strongly recommended the youthful Houghton. He was enthusiastically received in Detroit and rapidly became one of its best-known citizens, with the young men of his acquaintance soon styling themselves &quot;the Houghton boys&quot;.

Houghton quickly was selected by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, US Indian Agent and geologist, to act as physician-naturalist on expeditions through Lake Superior and the upper Mississippi valley in 1831 and 1832. On these trips Houghton did extensive botanical collecting, investigated the Lake Superior copper deposits of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, and provided medical care to the Indian tribes they encountered. Houghton administered more than 2,000 smallpox vaccinations to Indians in the Chippewa region over the course of his two months exploring with Henry Schoolcraft in 1832, undoubtedly saving many Indian lives. Houghton estimated that the disease had appeared among the Chippewa at least five times in the previous 60 years.

In 1833 Houghton married his childhood friend Harriet Stevens; they had two daughters together. He established a flourishing medical practice in Detroit and earned the affectionate description: &quot;the little doctor, our Dr. Houghton&quot;. By 1836 he had largely set aside the medical profession to concentrate on real estate speculation. His scientific interests remained strong, however. As Michigan achieved statehood in 1837, Houghton returned to public life and his love of the natural world.

One of the first acts of the new Michigan state government was to organize a state geological survey, following a pattern already established in other states. Houghton&#x27;s appointment as the first state geologist was unanimously hailed, and he occupied that position for the remainder of his life.

In 1839 he was also named the first professor of geology, mineralogy, and chemistry at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He continued to reside in Detroit. He and his survey assistants spent many weeks in the field each season, mapping and evaluating Michigan&#x27;s natural resources, and his personal influence with state legislators kept the project moving in the face of many financial difficulties. His fourth annual report, based on field work done in 1840, appeared February 1, 1841. It helped trigger the first great mining boom of American history, and earned him the title of &quot;father of copper mining in the United States&quot;.

He was a founding member and treasurer of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists (the predecessor of the American Association for the Advancement of Science) and served on several of its committees. A lifelong Episcopalian and staunch Democrat, he was elected to a term as mayor of Detroit in 1842, apparently against his wishes. He administered competently, raising the possibility of higher political office, perhaps governor.

==Death==
In 1845, with the state survey moribund because of the lack of funds, Houghton organized a combined linear and geological survey of the Lake Superior region that was funded by the federal government. While working on that survey, he and two companions drowned in Lake Superior near Eagle River, Michigan, when their small boat capsized in a storm. His demise sent waves of shock through Michigan and the entire country. His reluctance to yield to the expressed concerns of his voyageurs about the worsening weather conditions may have contributed to the disaster. His remains were discovered on the shoreline the next spring 1846 and returned to Detroit, where they were buried in Elmwood Cemetery. Neither of the surveys on which he was working at the time was ever completed.

==Legacy==
Although Houghton resided in Detroit during his years in Michigan, he is strongly associated with the Keweenaw Peninsula. He explored the area in 1831 and 1832, and conducted a survey of the peninsula in 1840 as State Geologist of the newly formed state. Houghton&#x27;s 1841 survey report was 88 pages in length; for more than 27 pages he discussed the copper and copper ore he had seen in his travels. He famously concluded, &quot;the copper ores are not only of superior quality, but also that their associations are such as to render them easily reduced&quot;. He noted that samples of ore he had tested were richer than the copper ore then being mined in Cornwall. His warning against prospectors rushing to the area in hopes of striking it rich became famous during the copper boom: &quot;look closely before the step is taken, which will most certainly end in disappointment and ruin&quot;. However, to his death Houghton never came to realize that in the Keweenaw ores like those in Cornwall were present in vanishingly small amounts, and all the copper mined turned out to be native, pure copper. Nevertheless, Houghton&#x27;s report prompted a major rush of settlers to the peninsula.

Houghton&#x27;s place in American history is somewhat problematic. Although he was the state geologist of Michigan for eight years, he never completed a comprehensive final report of his findings. One major reason may have been his early and unexpected death at the age of 36. He had multiple skills to apply, but he was not always successful in reconciling the conflicting demands of the various roles he filled. As a scientist his potential seems to have been considerable, but his death prevented that potential from being fully realized.

<text>The Government of Ireland Bill 1886, commonly known as the First Home Rule Bill, was the first major attempt made by a British government to enact a law creating home rule for part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It was introduced on 8 April 1886 by Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone to create a devolved assembly for Ireland which would govern Ireland in specified areas. The Irish Parliamentary Party had been campaigning for home rule for Ireland since the 1860s.

The bill, like his Irish Land Act 1870, was very much the work of Gladstone, who excluded both the Irish MPs and his own ministers from participation in the drafting. Following the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act 1885 it was to be introduced alongside a new Land Purchase Bill to reform tenant rights, but the latter was abandoned.

==Key aspects==
The key aspects of the 1886 bill were:

===Legislative===
* A unicameral assembly (deliberately not called a parliament to avoid links with the former Irish parliament abolished in 1800 under the Act of Union) consisting of two &quot;Orders&quot; which could meet either together or separately.
**The first Order was to consist of the 28 Irish representative peers (the Irish peers traditionally elected by all Irish peers to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster) plus 75 members elected through a highly restricted franchise. It could delay the passage of legislation for 3 years.
**The second Order was to consist of either 204 or 206 members. It had not been decided whether to have two members elected by the graduates of the Royal University to match the two members traditionally elected by graduates of Dublin University (Trinity College).
*All Irish MPs would be excluded from Westminster altogether.

===Executive===
* Executive power would be possessed by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whose executive would not be &quot;responsible&quot; to either Order.

===Reserve powers===
* Britain would still retain control over a range of issues including peace, war, defence, treaties with foreign states, trade and coinage.
* No special provision was made for Ulster.
* Britain would retain control of the Royal Irish Constabulary until it deemed it safe for control to pass to Dublin. The Dublin Metropolitan Police would pass to Irish control.

==Reaction==
When the bill was introduced, Charles Stewart Parnell had a mixed reaction. He said that it had great faults but was prepared to vote for it. In his famous , Gladstone beseeched Parliament to pass it and grant Home Rule to Ireland in honour rather than being compelled to one day in humiliation. Unionists and the Orange Order were fierce in their resistance; for them, any measure of Home Rule was denounced as nothing other than Rome Rule. In the staunchly loyalist town of Portadown, the so-called &#x27;Orange Citadel&#x27; where the Orange Order was founded in 1795, Orangemen and their supporters celebrated the Bill&#x27;s defeat by &#x27;Storming the Tunnel&#x27;. This was the headline in the local paper where it was reported that a mob attacked the small Catholic/Nationalist ghetto of Obins Street.

The vote on the Bill took place after two months of debate and, on 8 June 1886, 341 voted against it (including 93 Liberals) while 311 voted for it. Parliament was dissolved on 26 June and the 1886 United Kingdom general election was called. The Liberal Unionist Party was formed to contest the election and won 77 seats. They formed a coalition government with the Conservatives and continued allying with them in subsequent elections until the parties merged in 1912.

Historians have suggested that the 1886 Home Rule Bill was fatally flawed by the secretive manner of its drafting, with Gladstone alienating Liberal figures like Joseph Chamberlain who, along with a colleague, resigned in protest from the ministry, while producing a Bill viewed privately by the Irish as badly drafted and deeply flawed.

<doc id="882310" wikidata="Q1077534" url="?curid=882310" title="Leicester South (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Leicester South is a constituency, recreated in 1974, represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament from 2024 by Shockat Adam.

It had been held from 2011 by Jonathan Ashworth of the Labour Co-op Party (which denotes he is a member of the Labour Party and Co-operative Party, one of 38 such current Labour MPs, and requires members to contribute practically to a cooperative business). A previous version of the seat existed between 1918 and 1950. Except for a 2004 by-election when it was won by the Liberal Democrats, Leicester South was held by the Labour Party from 1987 to 2024, when it was taken with a narrow majority by Shockat Adam standing as an independent.

== Constituency profile ==
Leicester South has a population of 120,090 in an area of 19.2 km2, making it the 51st smallest parliamentary constituency by area. Mainly built-up (92%), its land also has 6% green areas or leisure facilities and just 1% agricultural.

By broad ethnic group, most people are Asian (43.5%) or White (39.0%), with 9.2% Black, African or Caribbean.

The rate of child poverty in Leicester South is high. At 43.4% in 2022–3, it is more than twice the overall UK rate of 20.1%. The claimant rate for unemployment benefit is 15.9%, higher than the UK average of 11.3%.

In 2020, the most affluent part of the constituency, Knighton, reports estimated average household incomes after housing costs of £35,900, with Clarendon Park &amp; Stoneygate South averaging £29,600. By contrast, households in neighbouring Saffron Lane average just £18,600.

== History ==
The seat was held by Derek Spencer for the Conservative Party between the general elections of 1983 and 1987. Its electorate demonstrated increased Labour support thereafter in local and national elections. A 2004 by-election caused by the death of Labour MP Jim Marshall was fought under the shadow of the Iraq War, and was won by Parmjit Singh Gill who became at the time the only Liberal Democrat MP from an ethnic minority. He held the seat for a year before being defeated by Labour candidate Sir Peter Soulsby at the 2005 general election. Soulsby subsequently resigned in order to seek election as Mayor of Leicester in 2011, giving Leicester South its second by-election in the space of seven years; this time the seat was safely held by Labour.

The expansion of the city&#x27;s suburbs and commuter belt has altered the incomes and other demographic measures of the constituency. The seat saw close contests between Conservative and Labour candidates in the 1980s, with Jim Marshall losing the seat by 7 votes to the Conservatives in the 1983 general election, but regaining it in 1987.

Marshall died in 2004, and the resulting by-election was fiercely contested. As in a by-election in Birmingham Hodge Hill held on the same day, the Liberal Democrat candidates hoped—despite having additional competition for the anti-Iraq War vote from Respect—to build on their previous by-election gain at Brent East. The seat was won by the Liberal Democrat Parmjit Singh Gill, with a majority of 1,654.

Sir Peter Soulsby won the seat at the 2005 election, and was re-elected in 2010. Sir Peter resigned to seek election for the new position of Mayor of Leicester in 2011, triggering a by-election on 5 May 2011, that coincided with the referendum on the voting system. Jonathan Ashworth was elected as his successor, holding the seat for the Labour Party; he was re-elected in 2015 and 2017.

Despite being the only seat in Leicester served by three major parties in the past 35 years, Leicester South became regarded as the safest of the Labour seats in the city, with a majority in 2017 of 26,261 votes (52.0%), falling to 22,675 (45.2%) in 2019.

However, the historic volatility continued, with Ashworth suffering a surprise defeat in the July 2024 General Election. The seat was won by Shockat Adam standing as an independent, with a narrow majority of 979 votes (2.3%).

== Boundaries ==
1918–1950: The county borough of Leicester wards of Aylestone, Castle, Charnwood, De Montfort, Knighton, Martin&#x27;s, and Wycliffe.

The initial report of the Boundary Commission for England dated October 1947 and published in December 1947 recommended that Leicester retain three seats, including a revised Leicester South constituency consisting of the wards of Aylestone, De Montfort, Knighton, North Braunstone and Spinney Hill, giving an electorate of 67,574 as of the review date of 15 October 1946. When the Representation of the People Bill enacting the commission&#x27;s recommendations was debated in the House of Commons, the Government brought forward amendments at Committee stage on 24 March 1948 to allow 17 more constituencies in England. Home Secretary James Chuter Ede announced that the Boundary Commission would be invited to consider an additional constituency to each of nine cities, including Leicester. The Government issued a white paper proposing the new boundaries which created new borough constituencies of Leicester South East and Leicester South West in place of Leicester South. The Boundary Commission recommended no alteration to the proposals, and the revised constituencies were therefore enacted.

In 1969, the Second Periodical Report of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for England reduced Leicester from four seats to three, and recreated Leicester South as a borough constituency.

1974–1983: The county borough of Leicester wards of Aylestone, De Montfort, Knighton, Spinney Hill, The Castle, and Wycliffe wards of Leicester.

1983–2010: The City of Leicester wards of Aylestone, Castle, Crown Hills, East Knighton, Eyres Monsell, Saffron, Spinney Hill, Stoneygate, West Knighton and Wycliffe.

Minor boundary changes were made as a result of the Third Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in 1983. The new constituency took in about 3,000 voters who were previously in other Leicester seats. No changes were made in the Fourth Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in 1995.

2010–2024: The City of Leicester wards of Aylestone, Castle, Eyres Monsell, Freemen, Knighton, Spinney Hills, and Stoneygate.

In the Fifth Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in 2007, the constituency had only minor changes with 73 voters being added from Leicester West.

Further to a local government boundary review which became effective in May 2015, the Freemen ward was replaced by the Saffron ward and the additional Wycliffe ward was created, largely split off from the Spinney Hills ward.

2024-: The City of Leicester wards of Castle, Evington (part), Eyres Monsell, Knighton, Saffron, Spinney Hills, Stoneygate, and Wycliffe.
:&quot;Size of the constituency was reduced with the transfer of Aylestone ward to Leicester West. To partly compensate, polling district EVF in Evington ward was added from Leicester East.&quot;

<text>Crow Rock is a rock located off of Linney Head, Pembrokeshire, in west Wales. The area is considered to be a good diving location because of its marine life and shipwrecks. Crow Rock is not more than 20 feet wide. The rock lies south of Stackpole and Castlemartin community, the most southerly in Pembrokeshire.

==Wrecks==
Crow Rock has been the site of numerous reports of shipwreck, but only one has been confirmed by remains.

===Confirmed by evidence===
* Norwegian motor ferry &quot;Balholm&quot;, 26 February 1979. Lifeboat and lifejackets recovered. Location of wreck confirmed by divers.
===Unconfirmed precise location===
The following losses took place at or near Crow Rock, but evidence of the wrecks has not been confirmed by diving:
* Sailing vessel &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot;, 8 May 1824. The crew were saved. Location not confirmed.
* Wooden sailing vessel &quot;Elizabeth and Hannah&quot;, 7 March 1827. Crew saved. Location not confirmed.
* Schooner &quot;Catherine&quot;, 18 May 1873. Location not confirmed.
* Steamship &quot;Amelia&quot;, 28 October 1874. The Angle lifeboat rescued crew. Location not confirmed.
* &quot;SS Tormes&quot;, 30 October 1894. Location not confirmed.

==Marine life==
The area around Crow Rock has exposed limestone reefs with rocky outcrops and gullies. Surveys in the 2010s reported the shallows to be covered in kelp and red algae and on the rock faces more than 20 species of sea squirt and 20 species of sea sponge were recorded. In 2016, a &#x27;pink&#x27; candy striped flatworm &quot;(Prostheceraeus roseus)&quot; was spotted, the first to be the recorded in the UK, and in 2019 a curled octopus &quot;(Eledone cirrhosa)&quot; was recorded.

<doc id="882317" wikidata="Q528" url="?curid=882317" title="PSR B1257+12">
<text>PSR B1257+12, previously designated PSR 1257+12, alternatively designated PSR J1300+1240, is a millisecond pulsar, from the Sun, in the constellation Virgo, rotating at about 161 times per second (faster than the blade of a blender). It is also named Lich, after a powerful, fictional undead creature.

The pulsar has a planetary system with three known pulsar planets, named &quot;Draugr&quot; (PSR B1257+12 b or PSR B1257+12 A), &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (PSR B1257+12 c, or PSR B1257+12 B), and &quot;Phobetor&quot; (PSR B1257+12 d, or PSR B1257+12 C). They were both the first extrasolar planets to be discovered and the first pulsar planets to be discovered—B and C in 1992 and A in 1994. A is the lowest-mass planet yet discovered by any observational technique, having somewhat less than twice the mass of Earth&#x27;s moon.

==Nomenclature==
The convention that arose for designating pulsars was that of using the letters PSR (Pulsating Source of Radio) followed by the pulsar&#x27;s right ascension and degrees of declination. The modern convention prefixes the older numbers with a B meaning the coordinates are for the 1950.0 epoch. All new pulsars have a J indicating 2000.0 coordinates and also have declination including minutes. Pulsars that were discovered before 1993 tend to retain their B names rather than use their J names, but all pulsars have a J name that provides more precise coordinates of its location in the sky.

On their discovery, the planets were designated PSR 1257+12 A, B, and C, ordered by increasing distance. They were discovered before the convention that extrasolar planets receive designations consisting of the star&#x27;s name followed by lower-case Roman letters starting from &quot;b&quot;, in order of discovery, was established. However, they are listed under the latter convention on astronomical databases such as SIMBAD and the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, with A becoming b, B becoming c, and C becoming d.

In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names, submitted by the Planetarium Südtirol Alto Adige in Karneid, Italy, were Lich for the pulsar and Draugr, Poltergeist, and Phobetor for planets A, B, and C, respectively:
* A &quot;lich&quot; is an undead creature known for controlling other undead creatures with magic.
* &quot;Draugr&quot; refers to undead creatures in Norse mythology.
* &quot;Poltergeist&quot; is a name for supernatural beings that create physical disturbances, from the German for &quot;noisy ghost&quot;.
* &quot;Phobetor&quot; is, in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, one of the thousand sons of Somnus (Sleep) who appears in dreams in the form of beasts.

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars (including stellar remnants). In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This stellar remnant is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

==Pulsar==

===Discovery===

PSR B1257+12 was discovered by the Polish astronomer Aleksander Wolszczan on 9 February 1990 using the Arecibo radio telescope. It is a millisecond pulsar, a kind of neutron star, with a rotation period of 6.22 milliseconds (9,650 rpm), and was found to have anomalies in the pulsation period, which led to investigations as to the cause of the irregular pulses. In 1992, Wolszczan and Dale Frail published a famous paper on the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the Solar System. Using refined methods one more planet was found orbiting this pulsar in 1994.

===Characteristics===
The pulsar is estimated to have a mass of 1.4 , which is typical for most neutron stars and pulsars. The radius is estimated to be around (), also common for pulsars and neutron stars. The pulsar is extremely hot, with a surface temperature of up to around . The pulsar formed one to three billion years ago from a white dwarf merger, a pair of white dwarfs colliding and collapsing to form a rapidly spinning pulsar.

The discovery stimulated a search for planets orbiting other pulsars, but it turned out such planets are rare; only five other pulsar planets, orbiting PSR B1620−26, PSR B0943+10, PSR B0329+54, and PSR J1719−1438, have been confirmed.

==Planetary system==


===Planets===
In 1992, Wolszczan and Frail discovered that the pulsar had two planets. These were the first discovery of extrasolar planets to be confirmed; as pulsar planets, they surprised many astronomers who expected to find planets only around main-sequence stars. Additional uncertainty surrounded the system, because of a claim of an earlier pulsar planet around PSR 1829-10 that had to be retracted due to errors in calculations. In 1994, an additional planet was discovered. Additionally, this system may have an asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt.

The planets are believed to be the result of a second round of planetary system formation as a result of two white dwarfs merging with each other into a pulsar and a resulting disk of material in orbit around the star. Other scenarios include unusual supernova remnants or a quark-nova. However, the white dwarf–white dwarf merge model seems to be the most likely cause of the formation of the planets.

===Retracted claim of fourth orbital body===
In 1996, a possible Saturn-like (100 Earth mass) gas giant was announced orbiting the pulsar at a distance of about . The original hypothesis was retracted; a reinterpretation of the data led to a new hypothesis of a dwarf planet one-fifth the size of Pluto orbiting PSR B1257+12. It would have an average orbital distance of with an orbital period of approximately 4.6 years. The dwarf planet hypothesis was also retracted because further observations showed that the pulsation anomalies previously thought to reveal a fourth orbital body are &quot;not periodic and can be fully explained in terms of slow changes in the pulsar&#x27;s dispersion measure&quot;.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-234&quot; was a Type XB U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II, she was commanded by Kapitänleutnant Johann-Heinrich Fehler. Her first and only mission into enemy or contested territory consisted of the attempted delivery of uranium oxide and German advanced weapons technology to the Empire of Japan. After receiving the order of Hitler&#x27;s successor Admiral Dönitz to surface and surrender and of Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender, the submarine&#x27;s crew surrendered to the United States on 14 May 1945.

==Construction==
Originally built as a minelaying submarine, she was laid down at the Germaniawerft in Kiel on 1 October 1941; &quot;U-234&quot; was damaged during construction, but launched on 23 December 1943. Following the loss of in July 1944, it was decided not to use &quot;U-234&quot; as a minelayer; she was completed instead as a long-range cargo submarine with missions to Japan in mind.

==Sensors==
===Radar===
&quot;U-234&quot; was one of the few U-boats that was fitted with a FuMO-61 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; U-Radar Transmitter. 
This equipment was installed on the starboard side of the conning tower.
===Radar detection===
&quot;U-234&quot; was also fitted with the FuMB-26 &quot;Tunis&quot; antenna. The FuMB 26 &quot;Tunis&quot; combined the FuMB Ant. 24 Fliege and FuMB Ant. 25 Cuba II antennas. It could be mounted in either the Direction Finder Antenna Loop or separately on the bridge.


==Wartime service==

&quot;U-234&quot; returned to the &quot;Germaniawerft&quot; yard at Kiel on 5 September 1944, to be refitted as a transport. Apart from minor work, she had a snorkel added and 12 of her 30 mineshafts were fitted with special cargo containers the same diameter as the shafts and held in place by the mine release mechanisms. In addition, her keel was loaded with cargo, thought to be optical-grade glass and mercury, and her four upper-deck torpedo storage compartments (two on each side) were also occupied by cargo containers.

===Cargo===

The cargo to be carried was determined by a special commission, the &quot;Marine Sonderdienst Ausland&quot;, established towards the end of 1944, at which time the submarine&#x27;s officers were informed that they were to make a special voyage to Japan. When loading was completed, the submarine&#x27;s officers estimated that they were carrying 240 tons of cargo plus sufficient diesel fuel and provisions for a six- to nine-month voyage.

The cargo included technical drawings, examples of the newest electric torpedoes, one crated Me 262 jet aircraft, a Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb and what was later listed on the US Unloading Manifest as of uranium oxide. In the 1997 book &quot;Hirschfeld&quot;, Wolfgang Hirschfeld reported that he saw about 10 lead cubes with sides, and &quot;U-235&quot; painted on each, loaded into the boat&#x27;s cylindrical mine shafts. According to cable messages sent from the dockyard, these containers held &quot;U-powder&quot;.

When the cargo was loaded, &quot;U-234&quot; carried out additional trials near Kiel, then returned to the northern German city where her passengers came aboard.

===Passengers===

&quot;U-234&quot; was carrying twelve passengers, including a German general, four German naval officers, civilian engineers and scientists and two Japanese naval officers. The German personnel included General Ulrich Kessler of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, who was to take over &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; liaison duties in Tokyo; Kay Nieschling, a Naval Fleet Judge Advocate who was to rid the German diplomatic corps in Japan of the remnants of the Richard Sorge spy ring; Heinz Schlicke, a specialist in radar, infrared, and countermeasures and director of the Naval Test Fields in Kiel (later recruited by the US in Operation Paperclip); and August Bringewalde, who was in charge of Me 262 production at Messerschmitt.

The Japanese passengers were Lieutenant Commander Hideo Tomonaga of the Imperial Japanese Navy, a naval architect and submarine designer who had come to Germany in 1943 on the , and Lieutenant Commander Shoji Genzo, an aircraft specialist and former naval attaché.

===Voyage===
&quot;U-234&quot; sailed from Kiel for Kristiansand in Norway on the evening of 25 March 1945, accompanied by escort vessels and three Type XXIII coastal U-boats, arriving in Horten Naval Base two days later. The submersible spent the next eight days carrying out trials on her snorkel, during which she accidentally collided with a Type VIIC U-boat performing similar trials. Damage to both submarines was minor, and despite a diving and fuel oil tank being holed, &quot;U-234&quot; was able to complete her trials. She then proceeded to Kristiansand, arriving on about 5 April, where she underwent repairs and replenished her provisions and fuel.

&quot;U-234&quot; departed Kristiansand for Japan on 15 April 1945, running submerged at snorkel depth for the first 16 days, and surfacing after that only because her commander, Johann-Heinrich Fehler, considered he was safe from attack on the surface in the prevailing severe storm. From then on, she spent two hours running on the surface by night, and the remainder of the time submerged. The voyage proceeded without incident. The first sign that world affairs were overtaking the voyage was when the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;″s Goliath transmitter stopped transmitting, soon followed by the Nauen station. Fehler did not know it, but Germany&#x27;s naval HQ had fallen into Allied hands.

Then, on 4 May, &quot;U-234&quot; received a fragment of a broadcast from British and American radio stations announcing that Admiral Karl Dönitz had become Germany&#x27;s head of state following the death of Adolf Hitler. &quot;U-234&quot; surfaced on 10 May for better radio reception and received Dönitz&#x27;s last order to the submarine force, ordering all U-boats to surface, hoist white flags and surrender to Allied forces. Fehler suspected a trick and managed to contact , whose captain convinced him that the message was authentic.

At this point, the U-boat was almost equidistant from British, Canadian, and U.S. ports. Fehler decided not to continue his journey, and instead headed for the east coast of the United States. Fehler thought it likely that if they surrendered to Canadian or British forces, they would be imprisoned and it could be years before they were returned to Germany; he believed that the United States would probably just send them home.

Fehler consequently decided that he would surrender to U.S. forces, but radioed on 12 May that he intended to sail to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to surrender to ensure Canadian units would not reach him first. &quot;U-234&quot; then set course for Newport News, Virginia. During the passage Fehler disposed of his &quot;Tunis&quot; radar detector, the new &quot;Kurier&quot; radio communication system, and all Enigma machine-related documents and other classified papers. On learning that the U-boat was to surrender, the two Japanese passengers committed suicide by taking an overdose of Luminal, a barbiturate sedative and antiepileptic drug. They were buried at sea.

==Capture==

The difference between Kptlt. Fehler&#x27;s reported course to Halifax and his true course was soon realized by US authorities who dispatched two destroyers to intercept &quot;U-234&quot;. On 14 May 1945, she was encountered south of the Grand Banks, Newfoundland by . Members of &quot;Sutton&#x27;s&quot; crew took command of the U-boat and sailed her to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where &quot;U-805&quot;, &quot;U-873&quot;, and &quot;U-1228&quot; had already surrendered. Velma Hunt, a retired Penn State University environmental health professor, has suggested &quot;U-234&quot; may have put into two ports between her surrender and her arrival at the Portsmouth Navy Yard: once in Newfoundland, to land an American sailor who had been accidentally shot in the buttocks, and again at Casco Bay, Maine. News of &quot;U-234&#x27;s&quot; surrender with her high-ranking German passengers made it a major news event. Reporters swarmed over the Navy Yard and went to sea in a small boat for a look at the submarine.

===Secret cargo===

Since its capture, the &quot;U-234&quot; was treated with unusual secrecy, something noted in the press at the time and attributed to its high-ranking passengers. Even in 1945, rumors circulated that the submarine had contained uranium, but documents about the contents of the cargo, and its fate, remained classified for much of the Cold War. 

Various sources, including contemporary documents and later memoirs, cite the uranium contents as being of uranium oxide, separated into ten containers made out of lead and lined with gold. Many of the accounts, however, have inconsistencies and disagree on specifics, as historian Joseph Scalia has documented. Those onboard the boat appear to have been told that the contents were dangerous if opened; it is suspected that, if this was not simply a lie meant to keep them from inspecting them more closely, it may have been related to their potential pyrophoricity. Some have suggested that they did not contain uranium at all, but rather other pyrophoric alloys, or even biological or chemical weapons materials, although these suggestions would be contradicted by all of the other sources. 

No serious historian believes that the uranium would have been anything other than un-enriched. While Germany did have a nuclear program during World War II, German, American, and Soviet sources all indicate clearly that Germany lacked the facilities to enrich uranium (or produce any other kinds of fissile material) in production-level quantities. Rather, Scalia documents that the Japanese asked the Germans for the uranium officially for the purpose of research into chemical catalysts for the production of aviation fuel. It may have actually been desired for part of the small Japanese nuclear weapons program, although Japan did not itself have the facilities necessary to weaponize it. 

The ultimate disposition of the uranium has never been confirmed. Scalia traced its movement after capture from Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to the Indian Head Naval Station, and that it was shipped from there to an unspecified destination in late June 1945. After that, there are conflicting accounts. Major John Lansdale, the former head of Manhattan Project security, said in 1995 that the uranium was then directly sent to Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where it was enriched as part of the weapons program. While it has been suggested that perhaps the uranium was enriched and some of it made its way into the Little Boy atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, it does not appear that there was sufficient time for this to occur, and that, if enriched, it simply became part of the ever-growing postwar American uranium stockpile.

==Disposition==

As she was not needed by the US Navy, &quot;U-234&quot; was sunk off 40 miles northeast of Provincetown, Cape Cod as a torpedo target by on 20 November 1947 at 42°37’N 69°33’W.

<text>Alexander Macfarlane FRSE LLD (21 April 1851 – 28 August 1913) was a Scottish logician, physicist, and mathematician.

==Life==

Macfarlane was born in Blairgowrie, Scotland, to Daniel MacFarlane (Shoemaker, Blairgowrie) and Ann Small. He studied at the University of Edinburgh. His doctoral thesis &quot;The disruptive discharge of electricity&quot; reported on experimental results from the laboratory of Peter Guthrie Tait.

In 1878 Macfarlane spoke at the Royal Society of Edinburgh on algebraic logic as introduced by George Boole. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Peter Guthrie Tait, Philip Kelland, Alexander Crum Brown, and John Hutton Balfour. The next year he published &quot;Principles of the Algebra of Logic&quot; which interpreted Boolean variable expressions with algebraic manipulation.

During his life, Macfarlane played a prominent role in research and education. He taught at the universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, was physics professor at the University of Texas (1885–1894), professor of Advanced Electricity, and later of mathematical physics, at Lehigh University. In 1896 Macfarlane encouraged the association of quaternion students to promote the algebra. He became the Secretary of the Quaternion Society, and in 1909 its president. He edited the &quot;Bibliography of Quaternions&quot; that the Society published in 1904.

Macfarlane was also the author of a popular 1916 collection of mathematical biographies (&quot;Ten British Mathematicians&quot;), a similar work on physicists (&quot;Lectures on Ten British Physicists of the Nineteenth Century&quot;, 1919). Macfarlane was caught up in the revolution in geometry during his lifetime, in particular through the influence of G. B. Halsted who was mathematics professor at the University of Texas. Macfarlane originated an &quot;Algebra of Physics&quot;, which was his adaptation of quaternions to physical science. His first publication on &quot;Space Analysis&quot; preceded the presentation of Minkowski Space by seventeen years.

Macfarlane actively participated in several International Congresses of Mathematicians including the primordial meeting in Chicago, 1893, and the Paris meeting of 1900 where he spoke on &quot;Application of space analysis to curvilinear coordinates&quot;.

Macfarlane retired to Chatham, Ontario, where he died in 1913.

==Space analysis==
Alexander Macfarlane stylized his work as &quot;Space Analysis&quot;. In 1894 he published his five earlier papers and a book review of Alexander McAulay&#x27;s &quot;Utility of Quaternions in Physics&quot;. Page numbers are carried from previous publications, and the reader is presumed familiar with quaternions. The first paper is &quot;Principles of the Algebra of Physics&quot; where he first proposes the hyperbolic quaternion algebra, since &quot;a student of physics finds a difficulty in principle of quaternions which makes the square of a vector negative.&quot; The second paper is &quot;The Imaginary of the Algebra&quot;. Similar to Homersham Cox (1882/83), Macfarlane uses the hyperbolic versor as the hyperbolic quaternion corresponding to the versor of Hamilton. The presentation is encumbered by the notation
:formula_1
Later he conformed to the notation exp(A α) used by Euler and Sophus Lie. The expression formula_2 is meant to emphasize that α is a &quot;right versor&quot;, where π/2 is the measure of a right angle in radians. The π/2 in the exponent is, in fact, superfluous.

Paper three is &quot;Fundamental Theorems of Analysis Generalized for Space&quot;. At the 1893 mathematical congress Macfarlane read his paper &quot;On the definition of the trigonometric functions&quot; where he proposed that the radian be defined as a ratio of areas rather than of lengths: &quot;the true analytical argument for the circular ratios is not the ratio of the arc to the radius, but the ratio of twice the area of a sector to the square on the radius.&quot; The paper was withdrawn from the published proceedings of mathematical congress (acknowledged at page 167), and privately published in his &quot;Papers on Space Analysis&quot; (1894). Macfarlane reached this idea or ratios of areas while considering the basis for hyperbolic angle which is analogously defined.

The fifth paper is &quot;Elliptic and Hyperbolic Analysis&quot; which considers the spherical law of cosines as the fundamental theorem of the sphere, and proceeds to analogues for the ellipsoid of revolution, general ellipsoid, and equilateral hyperboloids of one and two sheets, where he provides the hyperbolic law of cosines.

In 1900 Alexander published &quot;Hyperbolic Quaternions&quot; with the Royal Society in Edinburgh, and included a sheet of nine figures, two of which display conjugate hyperbolas. Having been stung in the &quot;Great Vector Debate&quot; over the non-associativity of his Algebra of Physics, he restored associativity by reverting to biquaternions, an algebra used by students of Hamilton since 1853.

<doc id="882333" wikidata="Q42298454" url="?curid=882333" title="Greatness">
<text>Greatness is a concept of a state of exceptional superiority affecting a person or in a particular place or area. Greatness can also be attributed to individuals who possess a natural ability to be better than all others. An example of an expression of the concept in a qualified sense would be &quot;Hector is the definition of greatness&quot; or &quot;Napoleon was one of the greatest wartime leaders&quot;. In the unqualified sense it might be stated &quot;George Washington achieved greatness within his own lifetime&quot;, thus implying that &quot;greatness&quot; is a definite and identifiable quality. Application of the terms &quot;great&quot; and &quot;greatness&quot; is dependent on the perspective and subjective judgements of those who apply them. Whereas in some cases the perceived greatness of a person, place or object might be agreed upon by many, this is not necessarily the case, and the perception of greatness may be both fiercely contested and highly idiosyncratic.

Historically, in Europe, rulers were sometimes given the attribute &quot;the Great&quot;, as in Alexander the Great, Frederick the Great, Alfred the Great and Catherine the Great. Starting with the Roman consul and general Pompey, the Latin equivalent was also used, as in Pompeius Magnus, Albertus Magnus, and Carolus Magnus. The English language uses the Latin term , (literally &quot;great work&quot;) to describe certain works of art and literature.

Since the publication of Francis Galton&#x27;s &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot; in 1869, and especially with the accelerated development of intelligence tests in the early 1900s, there has been a vast amount of social scientific research published relative to the question of greatness. Much of this research does not actually use the term &quot;great&quot; in describing itself, preferring terms such as &quot;eminence&quot;, &quot;genius&quot;, &quot;exceptional achievement&quot;, etc. Historically the major intellectual battles over this topic have focused around the questions of nature versus nurture or person versus context. Today the importance of both dimensions is accepted by all, but disagreements over the relative importance of each are still reflected in variations in research emphases.

== Genetic approaches ==

Early scientific research on greatness had a strong genetic emphasis and focused on intelligence as the driving force behind the concept.

=== &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot; – Galton (1869) ===

The earliest such research, &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot;, by Francis Galton (1869), argued that people vary hugely in &quot;natural ability&quot; which is allegedly inherited biologically. Those at the very top end of the range, i.e., geniuses, become according to Galton the &quot;eminent&quot; 
achievers of their generation. To prove this thesis Galton collected data showing that genius clusters in what he termed &quot;Notable Family Lines&quot;, such as those of Bernoulli, Cassini, Darwin, Herschel, and Jussieu in science, or Bach in music.

Galton then calculated the odds of eminent people having eminent relations, taking into account the closeness of the biological connection (e.g., son vs grandson), and the magnitude of achievement of the eminent parent. His findings were as anticipated: the more famous the parent (i.e., the greater level of presumed &quot;natural ability&quot;), the greater likelihood there would be illustrious relatives; and the closer the blood tie, the greater those odds.

=== &quot;Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses&quot; – Cox (1926) ===

Catharine Cox&#x27;s book on &quot;The Early Mental Traits of Three Hundred Geniuses&quot; (1926), was similar to Galton&#x27;s in its orientation. Using the method that her mentor, Stanford Psychology Professor Lewis Terman, had developed for differentiating children in terms of intelligence, Cox coded records of childhood and adolescent achievements of 301 historic eminent leaders and creators to estimate what their IQs would have been on the basis of intellectual level of such achievements relative to the age at which they were accomplished. For example, John Stuart Mill reportedly studied Greek at 3, read Plato at 7, and learned calculus at 11. As such, what he was doing at 5, the average person couldn&#x27;t do until 9 years, 6 months of age, giving Mill an estimated IQ of 190.

Cox found that the perceived eminence of those with the highest IQs was higher than that of those attaining lower IQ estimates, and that those with higher IQs also exhibited more versatility in their achievements. For example, da Vinci, Michelangelo, Descartes, Benjamin Franklin, Goethe, and others with IQs in the mid 160s or above were superior in their versatility to those attaining lower scores, such as George Washington, Palestrina, or Philip Sheridan.

The work of both Cox and Galton has been criticized for failing to take sufficient account of the role of nurture, or more specifically socio-economic and educational advantage, in the achievements of these historical greats.

== Cultural approach ==

There was one major anthropological study of genius, and it was triggered specifically by the author&#x27;s contentions with Galton&#x27;s work.

=== &quot;Configurations of Cultural Growth&quot; – Kroeber (1944) ===
Alfred Kroeber&#x27;s &quot;Configurations of Cultural Growth&quot; (1944) looked at many of the same historic greats as did Galton and Cox, but from a completely different orientation. As a cultural anthropologist, Kroeber maintained that, in Simonton&#x27;s words, &quot;culture takes primacy over the individual in any account of human (behavior), and that historic geniuses are no exception...&quot;

To prove his thesis, Kroeber collected &quot;long lists of notable figures from several nationalities and historic eras&quot;, and then grouped them within a field and a shared cultural context, e.g., &quot;Configuration for American Literature&quot;. Then within these groupings he listed his notables in &quot;strict chronological order&quot;, identifying the most eminent figures by using capital letters for their surnames (e.g. EMERSON, LONGFELLOW, POE, WHITMAN, etc. in above configuration).

Kroeber found that genius never appeared in isolation, but rather, in Simonton&#x27;s words, that &quot;one genius cluster(ed) with others of greater and lesser fame in adjacent generations&quot;. He also found that there were historical &quot;crests&quot; and &quot;troughs&quot; in every field. These fluctuations in the appearance of genius were much too rapid to be explained by the simple mechanism of genetic inheritance along family lines.

Kroeber argued, in Simonton&#x27;s words, that his &quot;configurations&quot; were due to &quot;emulations&quot;: &quot;Geniuses cluster in history because the key figures of one generation emulate those in the immediately preceding generations... (until) it attains a high point of perfection that stymies further growth&quot;. At this point the &quot;tradition degenerates into empty imitation, as most creative minds move on to greener pastures&quot;.

Recent research is consistent with these explanations; but many aspects of the developmental process from birth to the attainment of greatness remain unaccounted for by Kroeber&#x27;s anthropological approach.

== Developmental approaches ==

Retrospective studies, involving extensive interviews with individuals who have attained eminence, or at least exceptional levels of achievement, have added much to our understanding of the developmental process. Two studies in particular stand out.

=== &quot;Scientific Elite&quot; – Zuckerman (1977) ===

Harriet Zuckerman&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States&quot;, is based on many sources of research evidence, including a series of forty-one extended interviews with American winners of the Nobel Prize for science.

Zuckerman reported her results around two main topics: How the Prize is Awarded, and Career Development of the Scientific Elite. Her findings on the first topic are briefly overviewed in the Wikipedia article regarding the Nobel Prize

In relation to the question of the career development of the scientific elite
Zuckerman uses the phrase &quot;accumulation of advantage&quot; to describe her findings. In her words: &quot;Scientists who show promise early in their careers (are) given greater opportunities in the way of research training and facilities. To the extent that these scientists are as competent as the rest or more so, they ultimately will do far better in terms of both role performance and reward... rewards (which) can be transformed into resources for further work... (and hence over time) scientists who are initially advantaged gain even greater opportunities for further achievement and rewards.&quot;

To see if &#x27;accumulation of advantage&#x27; was operating in the career development of the scientific elite, Zuckerman compared the careers of future laureates with those of &quot;members of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the scientific rank and file&quot; along a number of dimensions including socioeconomic origins, status of undergraduate and graduate education, the process of moving into the scientific elite, and first jobs and professorships.

She also interviewed forty-one Nobel laureates extensively about their &quot;apprenticeships&quot; to &quot;master&quot; scientists while they were doing their doctoral research, and other aspects of their career development related to the above topics.

Zuckerman concluded that evidence of &quot;accumulative of advantage&quot; was clearly present over the course of development, with result that her research &quot;... cast(s) considerable doubt on the conclusion that marked differences in performance between the ultra-elite and other scientists reflect equally marked differences in their initial capacities to do scientific work&quot;.

=== &quot;Developing Talent in Young People&quot; – Bloom (1985) ===

Benjamin Bloom and five colleagues conducted extensive interviews with 120 &quot;young men and women (as well as their parents and influential teachers)... who had reached the highest levels of accomplishment&quot; in six fields – Olympic sprint swimmers, Top 10 rated professional tennis players, concert pianists, accomplished sculptors, exceptional mathematicians, and outstanding research neurologists.

They report many findings relevant to the &quot;talent development process&quot;, including:
*Development was tied throughout to the values, interests, resources, and personal investments of the family of origin. In most families &quot;introduction to the field and initial... skill development occurred&quot; because the &quot;(p)arents (or other family members), in pursuing their own interests, created situations that intrigued, interested, or involved the child... The child&#x27;s interest was rewarded or encouraged...&quot; and the parents then provided other ways to extend this interest.
*The &quot;work ethic&quot; is central to talent development. It is developed by &quot;the home environment&quot; and &quot;...directly related to learning and participation in the chosen talent field&quot;.
*&quot;Each group of parents strongly encouraged their children&#x27;s development in a particularly highly approved talent field (related to the parents&#x27; own &quot;special interests&quot;) and gave much less support to other possible talent fields and activities.&quot;
*&quot;Families and teachers were crucial at every point along the way to excellence... what families and teachers do at different times and how they do it clearly sets the stage for exceptional learning in each talent field&quot;.
*&quot;Few... (of the) individuals (included in this study) were regarded as child prodigies&quot;; and, as a result, this research &quot;raises (serious) questions about earlier views of special gifts and innate abilities as necessary prerequisites of talent development&quot;.

== Recent approaches ==
A 1995 book by Hans Eysenck argues that a &quot;personality trait&quot; called Psychoticism is central to becoming a creative genius; and a more recent book by Bill Dorris (2009) looks at the influence of &quot;everything from genetics to cultural crises&quot;, including chance, over the course of development of those who attain greatness. See – Hans Eysenck, &quot;Genius: The Natural History of Creativity&quot; (1995), &quot;construct(s)... a model of genius and creativity&quot; whose &quot;novelty lies in (its) attempt to make personality differences central to the argument&quot;.

In particular Eysenck is interested in a personality trait called &quot;psychoticism ... chief among (whose) cognitive features is a tendency to &quot;over-inclusiveness&quot;, i.e., an inclination not to limit one&#x27;s associations to &quot;relevant&quot; ideas, memories, images, etc.&quot;

He considers a massive range of experimental psychological research in order to establish the underlying genetic, neuro-chemical mechanisms which may be operating to influence levels of creativity associated with fluctuations in &quot;the tendency towards over-inclusiveness indicative of psychoticism...&quot;

Eysenck&#x27;s assessment of his overall argument is as follows: &quot;There is no hint that the theory is more than a suggestion of how many disparate facts and hypotheses can be pulled together into a causal chain, explaining... the apogee of human endeavour – genius. If the theory has one point in its favour it is that every step can be tested experimentally, and that many steps have already received positive support from such testing.&quot;

; &quot;The Arrival of The Fittest&quot;

Bill Dorris&#x27;s book, &quot;The Arrival of The Fittest: How The Great Become Great&quot; (2009), attempts to address a number of issues which remain unanswered on the subject. These include the role of chance over the course of development, the importance of the development of unique personal characteristics to achieving greatness, and the influence of changes in the wider worlds surrounding the person – from interpersonal to societal - on the course of an individual&#x27;s development.

Dorris argues that those who attain &#x27;greatness&#x27; are credited with solving a key generational problem in a field and/or society (e.g., Albert Einstein resolving the conflict between Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell in physics at the outset of the 20th century; or Woody Guthrie providing a voice for the outcasts of the Great Depression of the 1930s).

Dorris&#x27;s core argument is that those who become &#x27;great&#x27; start out with sufficient genetic potential and then are able, over two or more decades, to obtain matches/fits with &quot;the right kind of problems&quot; to extend the development of these genetic biases into what Dorris terms, &quot;key characteristics&quot;. These are the intellectual, personality, and self characteristics which eventually turn out to be required to solve a key generational problem in their field and/or society.

Dorris argues that there are four types of matching processes which occur over the course of such development. These refer to matches between the developmental needs of the person and the opportunities and resources essential to engaging in problem solving activities that stimulate further development of those aspects of intelligence, personality, and self which eventually become key characteristics.

Two of these matching processes are covered extensively in the existing research literature: continuous matching and cumulative matching.

The other two of the matching processes described by Dorris are completely new to this book: catalytic matching and chaotic matching.

Dorris&#x27;s argument in relation to catalytic matching is that anyone who eventually becomes a &#x27;great&#x27; will have experienced one or more sustained periods of exceptionally accelerated development of their key characteristics, accelerations which serve massively to differentiate them from their former peers in terms of both development and visibility within the field.

This acceleration occurs because the person becomes the focal point (star) of a self-reinforcing system of expertise and resources (catalytic system) which thrives off this person&#x27;s accelerated development and visibility.

Dorris&#x27;s argument in relation to chaotic matching is that access to the resources and learning opportunities essential to the development of key characteristics of an eventual &#x27;great&#x27; often occurs not due to the efforts/planning of the individual, but simply due to chance events in the interpersonal, institutional or societal worlds around the person, who (unlike perhaps millions of equally capable peers) becomes the beneficiary of these chance events – events which Dorris argues can change a person&#x27;s entire future in much the same way as a lottery jackpot or a &quot;Titanic&quot; ticket.

Dorris documents his theoretical arguments with extensive case studies of a wide range of individuals, including Einstein, Elvis, Monet, Mozart, da Vinci, Abraham Lincoln, Watson and Crick, basketball great Bill Russell, Louis Armstrong, Bill Gates, Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Guthrie, and Norma Jeane/Marilyn Monroe.

<text>USS &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; (APD-134), ex-DE-718, was a for the United States Navy. She was named for Chief Watertender Charles Kleinsmith (1904–1942), who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism during the Battle of Midway.

==Namesake==
Charles Kleinsmith was born on 28 September 1904 in Zionsville, Pennsylvania. He enlisted in the United States Navy on 26 October 1922 as an apprentice seaman. Until honorably discharged on 5 October 1926 as fireman second class, he served on board several ships, including the battleships and .

Kleinsmith reenlisted in the Navy on 20 December 1928, and during the next 11 years he had duty on board the light cruisers and , the heavy cruiser and the light cruiser . He reported aboard the aircraft carrier on 27 December 1939 and transferred to the aircraft carrier on 31 October 1940. He achieved the rank of chief watertender.

During the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942, Chief Watertender Kleinsmith maintained auxiliary power on &quot;Yorktown&quot; after an intense Imperial Japanese Navy bombing attack extinguished the fires in all of her boilers but one. At the end of the attack, Kleinsmith was missing and presumed dead. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

==Construction and commissioning==
Originally a designated DE-718, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; was re-designated as APD-134 on 17 July 1944, even before being laid down on 30 August 1944 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company, Bay City, Michigan. She was launched on 27 January 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Mary Agnes Kleinsmith. Builders trials before her pre-commissioning cruise were done in Lake Huron.

After completion, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; sailed from the builder&#x27;s yard at Bay City to Chicago, Illinois. From there, they went through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and down the Chicago River to Joliet, Illinois, where pontoons were attached to the ship so it could be pushed down the Des Plaines River, Illinois River, and Mississippi River as part of a barge train. After arriving at the Todd Johnson Shipyard in Algiers, Louisiana, on the west bank of the Mississippi at New Orleans, the rest of the crew reported aboard, and &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; was commissioned at New Orleans on 12 June 1945.

==Service history==

===1945–1951===
As an APD, her primary role was to land raiding parties on enemy beaches and Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) personnel on beach obstacle clearance operations. APDs also retained the sound gear and some anti-submarine weapons of destroyer escorts, and served as escorts to amphibious groups. Because they could take on extra personnel, they were often designated as rescue ships if a transport went down.

After shakedown out of Guantanamo Bay, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 21 July. Departing on 4 August for the Pacific, the high-speed transport steamed via the Panama Canal, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor, and reached Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 1 October. She operated between Okinawa and the Japanese home islands until 21 February 1946. She then sailed from Sasebo via the Marshall Islands and Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Francisco on 24 March with 118 returning veterans embarked. Departing on 10 April, she proceeded via the Panama Canal to the East Coast, arriving at Norfolk on 1 May 1946.

Based at Norfolk and NAB Little Creek, during the next six years, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast from Labrador to Venezuela while conducting amphibious and anti-submarine operations. She served primarily as an amphibious command ship; many of her cruises carried her into the Caribbean, where she operated out of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guantanamo Bay.

===1951–1960===
During January 1951, the &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; embarked an Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) at Little Creek to participate in the filming of &quot;The Frogmen&quot;, a Hollywood film chronicling the adventures of the Navy&#x27;s UDT divers in the Pacific during World War II. Departing Norfolk on 3 January 1951, the warship stopped at Key West, Florida, and Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, before commencing ten days of filming between 15 January and 6 February. According to the command historian, &quot;Dana Andrews and Richard Widmark helped make the old &#x27;klinker-dinker&#x27; a movie star.&quot;

Returning from the Caribbean on 13 February 1951, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; departed Little Creek on 5 March on the first of four deployments to the Mediterranean Sea. Arriving at Gibraltar on 15 March with UDT personnel embarked, she deployed with the 6th Fleet and participated in amphibious operations that ranged from Oran, Algeria, to Phaleron Bay, Greece. After serving as an amphibious control ship, she departed Gibraltar on 26 June for the United States, arriving at Little Creek on 6 July. On 19 July 1952, she departed for another four-month deployment with the 6th Fleet, and supported its important peace-keeping activities off the troubled lands of the Mediterranean.

Returning to Little Creek on 29 January 1955, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; resumed operations along the eastern seaboard to the Caribbean. On 9 January 1957, she again departed for duty with the 6th Fleet, and for almost three months operated in the Eastern Mediterranean. In response to an urgent request from King Hussein of Jordan, whose government was threatened with leftist-oriented, Egyptian-supported subversion, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; departed La Spezia, Italy, on 25 April for the Levantine Coast. Arriving off Beirut, Lebanon, on 30 April, she joined ships of the 6th Fleet in a formidable display of seapower, designed to show U.S. determination that the integrity and independence of nations in the Middle East would be guaranteed against Communist subversion or aggression. Remaining on station until 3 May, she then departed Rhodes, Greece, on 18 May, and returned to Little Creek on 1 June.

Less than three months later, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; sailed once again for the Mediterranean, arriving at Palermo, Sicily, on 15 September. During the previous August, a pro-Soviet takeover of the Syrian Army had threatened the stability of the Middle East. The high-speed transport proceeded to the Eastern Mediterranean on 19 September, and operated there to prevent aggression and to preserve peace. She departed Barcelona, Spain, on 4 November, and arrived back at Little Creek on 17 November.

In 1958, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; continued her activities along the Atlantic coast. While operating out of Guantanamo Bay on 24 October, she rescued 56 U.S. citizens and 3 foreign nationals at Nicaro, Cuba, where they were endangered by military operations between the Cuban Army and the Fidel Castro&#x27;s rebels. From 27 May to 3 August 1959, she cruised to the Great Lakes via the newly opened St. Lawrence Seaway. On 1 April 1960, &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; departed Little Creek for the Pacific. Steaming via the Panama Canal, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Guam, she arrived Tsoying, Taiwan, on 15 May. &quot;Kleinsmith&quot; was decommissioned on 16 May 1960, and was transferred the same day to the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China.
=== ROCS &quot;Tien Shan&quot; ===
The ship served in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS &quot;Tien Shan&quot; (APD-315), (later renumbered 215, 615, and 815). In the early 1970s, &quot;Tien Shan&quot; was fitted with a second 5-inch/38 mount aft, a Sea Chaparral surface-to-air missile launcher, and ASW torpedo tubes. At this time, she was re-rated as a patrol frigate. In the 1980s, &quot;Tien Shan&quot;, and other surviving ships of her class which were also transferred to Taiwan, were assigned to the Customs Service Coastal Patrol command, where they patrolled the economic exclusion zone. In this role, their armament was reduced to just one twin 40 mm mount in front of the bridge. She was still active in this role in 1995. Her decommissioning year is variously reported as 1997 or 1998.

<doc id="882357" wikidata="Q1072710" url="?curid=882357" title="Hartlepool (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Hartlepool is a borough constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament by Jonathan Brash of the Labour Party from 2024. The constituency covers the town of Hartlepool plus nearby settlements.

Labour won every contest for the seat since the first at the February 1974 election (and mostly won the predecessor constituency of The Hartlepools from the 1945 election onward) until Jill Mortimer won the 2021 by-election, becoming the first Conservative MP to represent Hartlepool since 1959. However, she lost her seat back to Labour three years later, falling to third place.

==Boundaries==
===1974–1983===
The County Borough of Hartlepool.

Before 1974 the seat was known as The Hartlepools (reflecting the representation of both old Hartlepool and West Hartlepool). The name was changed following the merger in 1967 of the County Borough of West Hartlepool and the Municipal Borough of Hartlepool to form the County Borough of Hartlepool.

===1983–present===
The Borough of Hartlepool.

&quot;As a result of major local government boundary changes in 1974 arising from the Local Government Act 1972, the Borough of Hartlepool was incorporated into the new county of Cleveland. As a consequence, a small part of the pre-1983 Easington constituency was added to the seat.&quot;

The 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies left the boundaries unchanged.

The seat is currently coterminous with the borough of Hartlepool, which has close to the average population for a UK parliamentary constituency. The seat includes the town of Hartlepool itself and the nearby villages of Hart, Elwick, Greatham, Newton Bewley and Dalton Piercy.

==History==

The constituency had previously substantially been in the constituency of The Hartlepools. It became the constituency of Hartlepool in 1974.

Hartlepool was a Labour constituency from its creation until 2021, although its predecessor did have Conservative MPs both in the early 1960s and during the Second World War. At the 1992 general election, Edward Leadbitter stood down and was succeeded by the former Labour Director of Communications Peter Mandelson. Mandelson&#x27;s pivotal role in the reshaping of the Labour Party into New Labour attracted much attention, and he became a prominent target.

During the first term of the Labour government led by Tony Blair, Mandelson was twice appointed to the Cabinet and twice forced to resign amid minor but controversial scandals. At the 2001 general election there was a notable contest when Arthur Scargill, former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers and the leader of the Socialist Labour Party, stood for election in the hope of exploiting uneasiness about New Labour in &quot;traditional&quot; Labour heartlands. In the event, Mandelson retained his seat, while Scargill polled only 912 votes. Mandelson shocked many with a triumphalist victory speech in which he declared &quot;They underestimated Hartlepool, and they underestimated me, because I am a fighter and not a quitter!&quot;.

The following year, the town&#x27;s first direct Mayoral election generated surprise when the mascot of Hartlepool United F.C., H&#x27;Angus the Monkey (real name Stuart Drummond) was elected on a platform that included free bananas for schoolchildren.

Mandelson resigned as MP for Hartlepool when he was appointed as a European Commissioner in the summer of 2004. This triggered a by-election that took place on 30 September. The Hartlepool by-election – the last held prior to the 2005 general election – saw Iain Wright retain the seat for Labour with a majority of 2,033 votes. That by-election marked the first time that the UK Independence Party had ever finished in third place at a by-election.

The Labour Party has continued to hold the seat since the by-election, with a dwindling majority and falling share of the vote, and at the three most recent general elections, three parties have finished in second place: the Liberal Democrats in 2005 (following their strong performance at the by-election the previous year), the Conservative Party in 2010, and UKIP, going one better than its by-election showing, in 2015.

In May 2010, the Conservatives gained their largest percentage vote increase in the country in Hartlepool, reducing the Labour majority to just over 5,500, whilst in 2015, UKIP recorded their eleventh-highest vote share in the United Kingdom, taking 28% and reducing the Labour majority to just over 3,000 votes.

==2010 general election==
Both the 2010 and 2015 general elections (in addition to several local elections) took place against the backdrop of concerns regarding the potential closure of Hartlepool and Stockton hospitals and their replacement with a new &quot;super hospital&quot; in out of town Wynyard. This precipitated the closure of several departments, and the removal of services from Hartlepool. The move was initially supported by Hartlepool MP Iain Wright, and opposed by Stockton South candidate James Wharton at the 2010 general election. A substantial protest group was formed opposing Wynyard, and calling on services to remain at Hartlepool, backed by a campaign by the &quot;Hartlepool Mail&quot;, a local newspaper.

Following the recession of 2008, the incoming coalition government announced it would scrap the Wynyard proposals, although no guarantees were made regarding the future of Hartlepool hospital. This issue continued to dominate politics in Hartlepool at both general elections and local council elections, which dented support for Iain Wright and Labour, who had backed the Wynyard plans, whilst many independent candidates gained traction.

At the 2010 general election, the Conservative Party approached Alan Wright, a regional broadcaster for the BBC and columnist for the &quot;Hartlepool Mail&quot;, to stand as its candidate, despite his lack of political and campaigning experience, hoping that his high-profile would help. It was also noted that the similarity of his name to that of the town&#x27;s MP, and the fact he would feature above him on the ballot paper, might result in additional votes. The Conservative Party gained a swing of 16.7%, the largest in the country, taking second place from the Liberal Democrats, and garnering it a vote share far exceeding their traditional local support.

==2015 general election==
Sitting MP Iain Wright was the only candidate from 2010 to remain on the much-extended ballot paper in 2015, in which the three main parties faced competition from UKIP, the Green Party, and three independent candidates, each standing primarily on healthcare-related platforms.

Popular local taxi driver and charity fundraiser Stephen Picton put himself forward as the voice of the hospital campaigners, although this was challenged by the last-minute candidacy of Sandra Allison, who stood under the banner of &#x27;Your Vote Could Save Our Hospital&#x27;. John Hobbs, an 80 year old autism campaigner stood under the tagline &#x27;Tell it like it is&#x27;.

UKIP earmarked Hartlepool as a potential gain, and the seat became one of its top ten national targets as well as its main target in the north-east, attracting significant party funding, visits from leader Nigel Farage, and the regional party conference. It selected Philip Broughton, a former Stockton Conservative Councillor and wrestling entrepreneur, as its candidate. The Conservative Party selected public affairs consultant and competitive swimmer, Richard Royal, as its candidate.

The Conservative Party&#x27;s national &#x27;40/40 strategy&#x27; meant that much of its regional resources were directed towards the marginal seats of Stockton South and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, forcing candidates to campaign outside of their selected seats. The Green Party selected local member Michael Holt, who had been arrested the previous year for obstructing a police officer at a protest in London, although charges were subsequently dropped. Just days before the nomination deadline, the Liberal Democrats selected Darlington-based Hilary Allen as its candidate.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2015, a &#x27;We Love Our Hospital&#x27; rally was organised by Save Our Hospital and the Teesside Peoples&#x27; Assembly Against Austerity, attracting large crowds in Hartlepool town centre. Candidates Iain Wright, Richard Royal, Philip Broughton, Stephen Picton and Michael Holt each gave speeches alongside other selected speakers. It was reported that Wright was booed and heckled by the crowd.

One day prior to the general election, local football club Hartlepool United F.C. took the unprecedented step of openly criticising Wright, and seemingly encouraging fans to support either Royal or Broughton, both of whom had met the club&#x27;s leadership and shown support for its interests. The club had been under pressure, facing relegation and had an ongoing land dispute with the Labour council.

Throughout the campaign, both Phillip Broughton and Richard Royal sought to portray themselves as the only viable alternative to Iain Wright, with Broughton distributing leaflets claiming that the Hartlepool election was a &#x27;two horse race&#x27;, and Royal referring to the close 2010 result, with his slogan &quot;Wright for your town? Wrong for your future. Turn Hartlepool Royal Blue&quot;. As a result, much of the anti Labour vote was split, with UKIP and the Conservatives gaining a combined 48.9% compared to Iain Wright&#x27;s 35.6%, but neither taking enough votes individually to defeat Labour. At one point during election night itself, the vote looked so close that a recount was reported to be due, but this proved to be unnecessary after the inclusion of postal votes.

==2017 general election==
Following the 2015 general election result, Hartlepool became the 35th most vulnerable Labour seat in the country. At the EU referendum in 2016 Hartlepool voted to &#x27;Leave&#x27; by 69.5%, making it one of the highest Leave-voting Labour-held seats in the UK. Despite this intense Euroscepticism in the area making it perceived as a vulnerable seat for Labour, at the 2017 general election Labour&#x27;s new candidate Mike Hill retained the seat, with UKIP&#x27;s vote falling by 17 points and Labour&#x27;s rising by 17 points. This gave Labour their biggest total vote and popular vote majority in Hartlepool since 2001.

Following an allegation of sexual assault made against him in September 2019, Hill sat as an Independent. However, three weeks later, the allegation was withdrawn, and he had the Labour whip restored.

==2021 by-election==

On 16 March 2021 Mike Hill resigned as the MP for Hartlepool, triggering a by-election. The election was won by Jill Mortimer of the Conservative Party. It is the first time the Conservatives have held the seat.

<doc id="882381" wikidata="Q2874819" url="?curid=882381" title="Axoplasm">
<text>Axoplasm is the cytoplasm within the axon of a neuron (nerve cell). For some neuronal types this can be more than 99% of the total cytoplasm.

Axoplasm has a different composition of organelles and other materials than that found in the neuron&#x27;s cell body (soma) or dendrites. In axonal transport (also known as axoplasmic transport) materials are carried through the axoplasm to or from the soma.

The electrical resistance of the axoplasm, called axoplasmic resistance, is one aspect of a neuron&#x27;s cable properties, because it affects the rate of travel of an action potential down an axon. If the axoplasm contains many molecules that are not electrically conductive, it will slow the travel of the potential because it will cause more ions to flow across the axolemma (the axon&#x27;s membrane) than through the axoplasm.

==Structure==
Axoplasm is composed of various organelles and cytoskeletal elements. The axoplasm contains a high concentration of elongated mitochondria, microfilaments, and microtubules. Axoplasm lacks much of the cellular machinery (ribosomes and nucleus) required to transcribe and translate complex proteins. As a result, most enzymes and large proteins are transported from the soma through the axoplasm. Axonal transport occurs either by fast or slow transport. Fast transport involves vesicular contents (like organelles) being moved along microtubules by motor proteins at a rate of 50–400mm per day. Slow axoplasmic transport involves the movement of cytosolic soluble proteins and cytoskeletal elements at a much slower rate of 0.02-0.1mm/d. The precise mechanism of slow axonal transport remains unknown but recent studies have proposed that it may function by means of transient association with the fast axonal transport vesicles. Though axonal transport is responsible for most organelles and complex proteins present in the axoplasm, recent studies have shown that some translation does occur in axoplasm. This axoplasmic translation is possible due to the presence of localized translationally silent mRNA and ribonuclear protein complexes.

==Function==

=== Signal transduction ===

Axoplasm is integral to the overall function of neurons in propagating action potential through the axon. The amount of axoplasm in the axon is important to the cable like properties of the axon in cable theory. In regards to cable theory, the axoplasmic content determines the resistance of the axon to a potential change. The composing cytoskeletal elements of axoplasm, neural filaments, and microtubules provide the framework for axonal transport which allows for neurotransmitters to reach the synapse. Furthermore, axoplasm contains the pre-synaptic vesicles of neurotransmitter which are eventually released into the synaptic cleft.

=== Damage detection and regeneration ===
Axoplasm contains both the mRNA and ribonuclearprotein required for axonal protein synthesis. Axonal protein synthesis has been shown to be integral in both neural regeneration and in localized responses to axon damage. When an axon is damaged, both axonal translation and retrograde axonal transport are required to propagate a signal to the soma that the cell is damaged.

==History==

Axoplasm was not a main focus for neurological research until after many years of learning of the functions and properties of squid giant axons. Axons in general were very difficult to study due to their narrow structure and in close proximity to glial cells. To solve this problem squid axons were used as an animal model due to the relatively vast sized axons compared to humans or other mammals. These axons were mainly studied to understand action potential, and axoplasm was soon understood to be important in membrane potential. The axoplasm was at first just thought to be very similar to cytoplasm, but axoplasm plays an important role in transference of nutrients and electrical potential that is generated by neurons.

It actually proves quite difficult to isolate axons from the myelin that surrounds it, so the squid giant axon is the focus for many studies that touch on axoplasm. As more knowledge formed from studying the signalling that occurs in neurons, transfer of nutrients and materials became an important topic to research. The mechanisms for the proliferation and sustained electrical potentials were affected by the fast axonal transport system. The fast axonal transport system uses the axoplasm for movement, and contains many non-conductive molecules that change the rate of these electrical potentials across the axon, but the opposite influence does not occur. The fast axonal transport system is able to function without an axolemma, implying that the electrical potential does not influence the transport of materials through the axon. This understanding of the relationship of axoplasm regarding transport and electrical potential is critical in the understanding of the overall brain functions.

With this knowledge, axoplasm has become a model for studying varying cell signaling and functions for the research of neurological diseases like Alzheimer&#x27;s, and Huntington&#x27;s. Fast axonal transport is a crucial mechanism when examining these diseases and determining how a lack of materials and nutrients can influence the progression of neurological disorders.

<doc id="882382" wikidata="Q7170270" url="?curid=882382" title="Persianate society">
<text>A Persianate society is a society that is based on or strongly influenced by the Persian language, culture, literature, art and/or identity.

The term &quot;Persianate&quot; is a neologism credited to Marshall Hodgson. In his 1974 book, &quot;The Venture of Islam: The expansion of Islam in the Middle Periods&quot;, he defined it thus: &quot;The rise of Persian had more than purely literary consequences: it served to carry a new overall cultural orientation within Islamdom... Most of the more local languages of high culture that later emerged among Muslims... depended upon Persian wholly or in part for their prime literary inspiration. We may call all these cultural traditions, carried in Persian or reflecting Persian inspiration, &#x27;Persianate&#x27; by extension.&quot;

The term designates ethnic Persians but also societies that may not have been predominantly ethnically Persian but whose linguistic, material or artistic cultural activities were influenced by or based on Persianate culture. Examples of pre-19th-century Persianate societies were the Seljuq, Timurid, Mughal, and Ottoman dynasties.

==History==
Persianate culture flourished for nearly fourteen centuries. It was a mixture of Persian and Islamic cultures that eventually underwent Persification and became the dominant culture of the ruling and elite classes of Greater Iran, Asia Minor, and South Asia.

When the peoples of Greater Iran were conquered by Islamic forces in the 7th and 8th centuries, they became part of an empire much larger than any previous one under Persian rule. While the Islamic conquest led to the Arabization of language and culture in the former Byzantine territories, this did not happen in Persia. Rather, the new Islamic culture evolving there was largely based on pre-Islamic Persian traditions of the area, as well as on the Islamic customs that were introduced to the region by the Arab conquerors.

Persianate culture, especially among the elite classes, spread across the Muslim territories in western, central, and south Asia, although populations across this vast region had conflicting allegiances (sectarian, local, tribal, and ethnic) and spoke many different languages. It was spread by poets, artists, architects, artisans, jurists, and scholars, who maintained relations among their peers in the far-flung cities of the Persianate world, from Anatolia to India.

Persianate culture involved modes of consciousness, ethos, and religious practices that have persisted in the Iranian world against hegemonic Arab Muslim (Sunni) cultural constructs. This formed a calcified Persianate structure of thought and experience of the sacred, entrenched for generations, which later informed history, historical memory, and identity among Alid loyalists and heterodox groups labeled by sharia-minded authorities as &quot;ghulāt&quot;. In a way, along with investing the notion of heteroglossia, Persianate culture embodies the Iranian past and ways in which this past blended with the Islamic present or became transmuted. The historical change was largely on the basis of a binary model: a struggle between the religious landscapes of late Iranian antiquity and a monotheist paradigm provided by the new religion, Islam.

This duality is symbolically expressed in the Shiite tradition that Husayn ibn Ali, the third Shi&#x27;ite Imam, had married Shahrbanu, daughter of Yazdegerd III, the last Sassanid king of Iran. This genealogy makes the later imams, descended from Husayn and Shahrbanu, the inheritors of both the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and of the pre-Islamic Sassanid kings.

==Origins==
After the Arab Muslim conquest of Iran, Pahlavi, the language of Pre-Islamic Iran, continued to be widely used well into the second Islamic century (8th century) as a medium of administration in the eastern lands of the Caliphate. Despite the Islamization of public affairs, the Iranians retained much of their pre-Islamic outlook and way of life, adjusted to fit the demands of Islam. Towards the end of the 7th century, the population began resenting the cost of sustaining the Arab caliphs, the Umayyads, and in the 8th century, a general Iranian uprising—led by Abu Muslim Khorrasani—brought another Arab family, the Abbasids, to the Caliph&#x27;s throne.

Under the Abbasids, the capital shifted from Syria to Iraq, which had once been part of the Sassanid Empire and was still considered to be part of the Iranian cultural domain. Persian culture, and the customs of the Persian Barmakid viziers, became the style of the ruling elite. Politically, the Abbasids soon started losing their control over Iranians. The governors of Khurasan, the Tahirids, though appointed by the caliph, were effectively independent. When the Persian Saffarids from Sistan freed the eastern lands, the Buyyids, the Ziyarids and the Samanids in Western Iran, Mazandaran and the north-east respectively, declared their independence.

The separation of the eastern territories from Baghdad was expressed in a distinctive Persianate culture that became dominant in west, central, and south Asia, and was the source of innovations elsewhere in the Islamic world. The Persianate culture was marked by the use of the New Persian language as a medium of administration and intellectual discourse, by the rise of Persianised-Turks to military control, by the new political importance of non-Arab ulama and by the development of an ethnically composite Islamic society.

Pahlavi was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Sassanian Empire before the Arab invasion, but towards the end of the 7th and the beginning of the 8th century Arabic became a medium of literary expression. In the 9th century, a New Persian language emerged as the idiom of administration and literature. The Tahirid and Saffarid dynasties continued using Persian as an informal language, although for them Arabic was the &quot;language for recording anything worthwhile, from poetry to science&quot;, but the Samanids made Persian a language of learning and formal discourse. The language that appeared in the 9th and 10th centuries was a new form of Persian, derivative of the Middle-Persian of pre-Islamic times, but enriched by Arabic vocabulary and written in the Arabic script.

The Persian language, according to Marshall Hodgson in his &quot;The Venture of Islam&quot;, was to form the chief model for the rise of still other languages to the literary level. Like Turkish, most of the more local languages of high culture that later emerged among Muslims were heavily influenced by Persian (Urdu being a prime example). One may call these traditions, carried in Persian or reflecting Persian inspiration, ‘Persianate’ by extension. This seems to be the origin of the term &quot;Persianate&quot;.

==Spread==

The Iranian dynasty of the Samanids began recording its court affairs in Persian as well as Arabic, and the earliest great poetry in New Persian was written for the Samanid court. The Samanids encouraged translation of religious works from Arabic into Persian. In addition, the learned authorities of Islam, the &quot;ulama&quot;, began using the Persian &quot;lingua franca&quot; in public. The crowning literary achievement in the early New Persian language was the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (Book of Kings), presented by its author Ferdowsi to the court of Mahmud of Ghazni (998–1030). This was a kind of Iranian nationalistic resurrection: Ferdowsi galvanized Persian nationalistic sentiment by invoking pre-Islamic Persian heroic imagery and enshrined in literary form the most treasured folk stories.

Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; enjoyed a special status in Iranian courtly culture as a historical narrative as well as a mythical one. The powerful effect that this text came to have on the poets of this period is partly due to the value that was attached to it as a legitimizing force, especially for new rulers in the Eastern Islamic world:

The Persianate culture that emerged under the Samanids in Greater Khorasan, in northeast Persia and the borderlands of Turkistan exposed the Turks to Persianate culture; The incorporation of the Turks into the main body of the Middle Eastern Islamic civilization, which was followed by the Ghaznavids, thus began in Khorasan; &quot;not only did the inhabitants of Khurasan not succumb to the language of the nomadic invaders, but they imposed their own tongue on them. The region could even assimilate the Turkic Ghaznavids and Seljuks (11th and 12th centuries), the Timurids (14th and 15th centuries), and the Qajars (19th and 20th centuries).

The Ghaznavids, the rivals and future successors of the Samanids, ruled over the southeastern extremities of Samanid territories from the city of Ghazni. Persian scholars and artists flocked to their court, and the Ghaznavids became patrons of Persianate culture. The Ghaznavids took with them Persianate culture as they subjugated Western and Southern Asia . Apart from Ferdowsi, Rumi, Abu Ali Sina, Al-Biruni, Unsuri Balkhi, Farrukhi Sistani, Sanayi Ghaznawi and Abu Sahl Testari were among the great Iranian scientists and poets of the period under Ghaznavid patronage.

Persianate culture was carried by successive dynasties into Western and Southern Asia, particularly by the Persianized Seljuqs (1040–1118) and their successor states, who presided over Iran, Syria, and Anatolia until the 13th century, and by the Ghaznavids, who in the same period dominated Greater Khorasan and parts of India. These two dynasties together drew the centers of the Islamic world eastward. The institutions stabilized Islamic society into a form that would persist, at least in Western Asia, until the 20th century.

The Ghaznavids moved their capital from Ghazni to Lahore in modern Pakistan, which they turned into another center of Islamic culture. Under their patronage, poets and scholars from Kashgar, Bukhara, Samarkand, Baghdad, Nishapur, Amol and Ghazni congregated in Lahore. Thus, the Persian language and Persianate culture was brought deep into India and carried further in the 13th century. The Seljuqs won a decisive victory over the Ghaznavids and swept into Khorasan; they brought Persianate culture westward into western Persia, Iraq, Anatolia, and Syria. Iran proper along with Central Asia became the heartland of Persian language and culture.

As the Seljuqs came to dominate western Asia, their courts were Persianized as far west as the Mediterranean Sea. Under their rule, many pre-Islamic Iranian traditional arts like Sassanid architecture were resurrected, and great Iranian scholars were patronized. At the same time, the Islamic religious institutions became more organized and Sunni orthodoxy became more codified.

The Persian jurist and theologian Al-Ghazali was among the scholars at the Seljuq court who proposed a synthesis of Sufism and Sharia, which became the basis for a richer Islamic theology. Formulating the Sunni concept of division between temporal and religious authorities, he provided a theological basis for the existence of the Sultanate, a temporal office alongside the Caliphate, which at that time was merely a religious office. The main institutional means of establishing a consensus of the &quot;ulama&quot; on these dogmatic issues was the Nezamiyeh, better known as the &quot;madrasas&quot;, named after its founder Nizam al-Mulk, a Persian vizier of the Seljuqs. These schools became the means of uniting Sunni &quot;ulama&quot;, who legitimized the rule of the Sultans. The bureaucracies were staffed by graduates of the madrasas, so both the &quot;ulama&quot; and the bureaucracies were under the influence of esteemed professors at the &quot;madrasas&quot;.

===Shahnameh&#x27;s impact and affirmation of Persianate culture===

As the result of the impacts of Persian literature as well as to further political ambitions, it became a custom for rulers in the Persianate lands to not only commission a copy of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, but also to have his own epic, allowing court poets to attempt to reach the level of Ferdowsi:

Iranian and Persianate poets received the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and modeled themselves after it. Murtazavi formulates three categories of such works too: poets who took up material not covered in the epic, poets who eulogized their patrons and their ancestors in &quot;masnavi&quot; form for monetary reward, and poets who wrote poems for rulers who saw themselves as heroes in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, echoing the earlier Samanid trend of patronizing the Shahnameh for legitimizing texts.

First, Persian poets attempted to continue the chronology to a later period, such as the &quot;Zafarnamah&quot; of the Ilkhanid historian Hamdollah Mostowfi (d. 1334 or 1335), which deals with Iranian history from the Arab conquest to the Mongols and is longer than Ferdowsi&#x27;s work. The literary value of these works must be considered on an individual basis as Jan Rypka cautions: &quot;all these numerous epics cannot be assessed very highly, to say nothing of those works that were substantially (or literally) copies of Ferdowsi. There are however exceptions, such as the &quot;Zafar-Nameh&quot; of Hamdu&#x27;llah Mustaufi a historically valuable continuation of the Shah-nama&quot; and the &quot;Shahanshahnamah&quot; (or &quot;Changiznamah&quot;) of Ahmad Tabrizi in 1337–38, which is a history of the Mongols written for Abu Sa&#x27;id.

Second, poets versified the history of a contemporary ruler for reward, such as the &quot;Ghazannameh&quot; written in 1361–62 by Nur al-Din ibn Shams al-Din. Third, heroes not treated in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and those having minor roles in it became the subjects of their own epics, such as the 11th-century &quot;Garshāspnāmeh&quot; by Asadi Tusi. This tradition, chiefly a Timurid one, resulted in the creation of Islamic epics of conquests as discussed by Marjan Molé. Also see the classification employed by Z. Safa for epics: &quot;milli&quot; (national, those inspired by Ferdowsi&#x27;s epic), &quot;tarikhi&quot; (historical, those written in imitation of Nizami&#x27;s &quot;Iskandarnamah&quot;) and &quot;dini&quot; for religious works. The other source of inspiration for Persianate culture was another Persian poet, Nizami, a most admired, illustrated and imitated writer of romantic &quot;masnavis&quot;.

Along with Ferdowsi&#x27;s and Nizami&#x27;s works, Amir Khusraw Dehlavi&#x27;s &quot;khamseh&quot; came to enjoy tremendous prestige, and multiple copies of it were produced at Persianized courts. Seyller has a useful catalog of all known copies of this text.

==Distinction==
In the 16th century, Persianate culture became sharply distinct from the Arab world to the west, the dividing zone falling along the Euphrates. Socially the Persianate world was marked by a system of ethnologically defined elite statuses: the rulers and their soldiery were non-Iranians in origin, but the administrative cadres and literati were Iranians. Cultural affairs were marked by a characteristic pattern of language use: New Persian was the language of state affairs, scholarship and literature and Arabic the language of religion.

==Safavids and the resurrection of Iranianhood in West Asia==
The Safavid dynasty ascended to predominance in Iran in the 16th century—the first native Iranian dynasty since the Buyyids. The Safavids, who were of mixed Kurdish, Turkic, Georgian, Circassian and Pontic Greek ancestry, moved to the Ardabil region in the 11th century. They re-asserted the Persian identity over many parts of West Asia and Central Asia, establishing an independent Persian state, and patronizing Persian culture They made Iran the spiritual bastion of Shi’ism against the onslaughts of orthodox Sunni Islam, and a repository of Persian cultural traditions and self-awareness of Persian identity.

The founder of the dynasty, Shah Isma&#x27;il, adopted the title of Persian Emperor &quot;Pādišah-ī Īrān&quot;, with its implicit notion of an Iranian state stretching from Afghanistan as far as the Euphrates and the North Caucasus, and from the Oxus to the southern territories of the Persian Gulf. Shah Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s successors went further and adopted the title of &quot;Shāhanshāh&quot; (king of kings). The Safavid kings considered themselves, like their predecessors the Sassanid Emperors, the &quot;khudāygān&quot; (the shadow of God on earth). They revived Sassanid architecture, build grand mosques and elegant &quot;charbagh&quot; gardens, collected books (one Safavid ruler had a library of 3,000 volumes), and patronized &quot;Men of the Pen&quot; The Safavids introduced Shiism into Persia to distinguish Persian society from the Ottomans, their Sunni archrivals to the west.

==Ottomans==

At the beginning of the 14th century, the Ottomans rose to predominance in Asia Minor. The Ottomans patronized Persian literature for five and a half centuries and attracted great numbers of writers and artists, especially in the 16th century. The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s undeniable affiliation with the Persianate world during the first few decades of the sixteenth century are illustrated by the works of a scribe from the Aq Qoyunlu court, Edris Bedlisi. One of the most renowned Persian poets in the Ottoman court was Fethullah Arifi Çelebi, also a painter and historian, and the author of the &quot;Süleymanname&quot; (or &quot;Suleyman-nama&quot;), a biography of Süleyman the Magnificent. At the end of the 17th century, they gave up Persian as the court and administrative language, using Turkish instead; a decision that shocked the highly Persianized Mughals in India. The Ottoman Sultan Suleyman wrote an entire divan in Persian language. According to Hodgson:

Toynbee&#x27;s assessment of the role of the Persian language is worth quoting in more detail, from &quot;A Study of History&quot;:

E. J. W. Gibb is the author of the standard &quot;A Literary History of Ottoman Poetry&quot; in six volumes, whose name has lived on in an important series of publications of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish texts, the Gibb Memorial Series. Gibb classifies Ottoman poetry between the &quot;Old School&quot;, from the 14th century to about the middle of the 19th century, during which time Persian influence was dominant; and the &quot;Modern School&quot;, which came into being as a result of the Western impact. According to Gibb in the introduction (Volume I):

The Saljuqs had, in the words of the same author:

==Persianate culture of South Asia==

In general, from its earliest days, Persian culture was brought into the Subcontinent (or South Asia) by various Persianised Turkic and Afghan dynasties. South Asian society was enriched by the influx of Persian-speaking and Islamic scholars, historians, architects, musicians, and other specialists of high Persianate culture who fled the Mongol devastation. The sultans of Delhi, who were of Turko-Afghan origin, modeled their lifestyles after the Persian upper classes. They patronized Persian literature and music, but became especially notable for their architecture, because their builders drew from Irano-Islamic architecture, combining it with Indian traditions to produce a profusion of mosques, palaces, and tombs unmatched in any other Islamic country. The speculative thought of the times at the Mughal court, as in other Persianate courts, leaned towards the eclectic gnostic dimension of Sufi Islam, having similarities with Hindu Vedantism, indigenous Bhakti and popular theosophy.

The Mughals, who were of Turco-Mongol descent, strengthened the Indo-Persian culture, in South Asia. For centuries, Iranian scholar-officials had immigrated to the region where their expertise in Persianate culture and administration secured them honored service within the Mughal Empire. Networks of learned masters and madrasas taught generations of young South Asian men Persian language and literature in addition to Islamic values and sciences. Furthermore, educational institutions such as Farangi Mahall and Delhi College developed innovative and integrated curricula for modernizing Persian-speaking South Asians. They cultivated Persian art, enticing to their courts artists and architects from Bukhara, Tabriz, Herat, Shiraz, and other cities of Greater Iran. The Taj Mahal and its Charbagh were commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his Iranian bride.

Iranian poets, such as Sa’di, Hafez, Rumi and Nizami, who were great masters of Sufi mysticism from the Persianate world, were the favorite poets of the Mughals. Their works were present in Mughal libraries and counted among the emperors’ prized possessions, which they gave to each other; Akbar and Jahangir often quoted from them, signifying that they had imbibed them to a great extent. An autographed note of both Jahangir and Shah Jahan on a copy of Sa’di&#x27;s &quot;Gulestān&quot; states that it was their most precious possession. A gift of a &quot;Gulestān&quot; was made by Shah Jahan to Jahanara Begum, an incident which is recorded by her with her signature. Shah Jahan also considered the same work worthy enough to be sent as a gift to the king of England in 1628, which is presently in the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin. The emperor often took out auguries from a copy of the &quot;diwan&quot; of Hafez belonging to his grandfather, Humayun. One such incident is recorded in his own handwriting in the margins of a copy of the &quot;diwan&quot;, presently in the Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library, Patna. The court poets Naziri, ‘Urfi, Faizi, Khan-i Khanan, Zuhuri, Sanai, Qodsi, Talib-i Amuli and Abu Talib Kalim were all masters imbued with a similar Sufi spirit, thus following the norms of any Persianate court.

The tendency towards Sufi mysticism through Persianate culture in Mughal court circles is also testified by the inventory of books that were kept in Akbar&#x27;s library, and are especially mentioned by his historian, Abu&#x27;l Fazl, in the &quot;Ā’in-ī Akbarī&quot;. Some of the books that were read out continually to the emperor include the &quot;masnavis&quot; of Nizami, the works of Amir Khusrow, Sharaf Manayri and Jami, the &quot;Masnavi i-manavi&quot; of Rumi, the &quot;Jām-i Jam&quot; of Awhadi Maraghai, the &quot;Hakika o Sanā’i&quot;, the &quot;Qabusnameh&quot; of Keikavus, Sa’di&#x27;s &quot;Gulestān&quot; and &quot;Būstān&quot;, and the &quot;diwans&quot; of Khaqani and Anvari.

This intellectual symmetry continued until the end of the 19th century, when a Persian newspaper, &quot;Miftah al-Zafar&quot; (1897), campaigned for the formation of Anjuman-i Ma’arif, an academy devoted to the strengthening of Persian language as a scientific language.

==Media of Persianate culture==
===Persian poetry (Sufi poetry)===
From about the 12th century, Persian lyric poetry was enriched with a spirituality and devotional depth not to be found in earlier works. This development was due to the pervasive spread of mystical experience within Islam. Sufism developed in all Muslim lands, including the sphere of Persian cultural influence. As a counterpoise to the rigidity of formal Islamic theology and law, Islamic mysticism sought to approach the divine through acts of devotion and love rather than through mere rituals and observance. Love of God being the focus of the Sufis&#x27; religious sentiments, it was only natural for them to express it in lyrical terms, and Persian Sufis, often of exceptional sensibility and endowed with poetic verve, did not hesitate to do so. The famous 11th-century Sufi, Abu Sa&#x27;id of Mehna frequently used his own love quatrains (as well as others) to express his spiritual yearnings, and with mystic poets such as Attar and Iraqi, mysticism became a legitimate, even fashionable subject of lyric poems among the Persianate societies. Furthermore, as Sufi orders and centers (&quot;Khaneghah&quot;) spread throughout Persian societies, Persian mystic poetic thought gradually became so much a part of common culture that even poets who did not share Sufi experiences ventured to express mystical ideas and imagery in their work.

===Shi&#x27;ism===
===Persian music===
==Conclusion==
As the broad cultural region remained politically divided, the sharp antagonisms between empires stimulated the appearance of variations of Persianate culture. After 1500, the Iranian culture developed distinct features of its own, with interposition of strong pre-Islamic and Shiite Islamic culture. Iran&#x27;s ancient cultural relationship with Southern Iraq (Sumer/Babylonia) remained strong and endured in spite of the loss of Mesopotamia to the Ottomans. Its ancient cultural and historical relationship with the Caucasus endured until the loss of Azerbaijan, Armenia, eastern Georgia and parts of the North Caucasus to Imperial Russia following the Russo-Persian Wars in the course of the 19th century. The culture of peoples of the eastern Mediterranean in Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt developed somewhat independently; India developed a vibrant and completely distinct South Asian style with little to no remnants of the once patronized Indo-Persian culture by the Mughals.

<text>Curcuma zedoaria (zedoary /ˈzɛdəʊərɪ/, white turmeric, or temu putih) is a perennial herb and member of the genus &quot;Curcuma&quot;, family Zingiberaceae. The plant is native to South Asia and Southeast Asia but is now naturalized in other places including the US state of Florida. Zedoary was one of the ancient food plants of the Austronesian peoples. They were spread during prehistoric times to the Pacific Islands and Madagascar during the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP). Its use as a spice in the West today is extremely rare, having been replaced by ginger, and to a lesser extent, yellow turmeric.

==Etymology==
The name zedoary derives from Persian via Arabic and Latin.
==Characteristics==
Zedoary grows in tropical and subtropical wet forest regions. The fragrant plant bears yellow flowers with red and green bracts and the underground stem section, a rhizome, is large and tuberous with numerous branches. The leaf shoots of the zedoary are large and can reach 1 meter (3 feet) in height.

==Uses==
===Food===
The edible rhizome of zedoary has a white interior and a fragrance reminiscent of mango. However, its flavour is more similar to ginger, except with a very bitter aftertaste. In Indonesia, it is ground to a powder and added to make white curry pastes, whereas in India, it tends to be used fresh or in pickling. In Thai cuisine it is used raw and cut in thin strips in certain Thai salads. It can also be served cut into thin slices together with other herbs and vegetables with certain types of &quot;nam phrik&quot; (Thai chilli pastes). It is also used in India to flavour dals and chutneys.

===Houseplant===
The showy &quot;C. zedoaria&quot; is occasionally used as a houseplant.

=== In traditional medicine ===
The plant is used traditionally to treat inflammation, pain, and a variety of skin ailments including wounds, as well as menstrual irregularities and ulcers.

=== Others ===
The essential oil produced from the dried rhizomes of &quot;Curcuma zedoaria&quot; is used in perfumery and soap fabrication, as well as an ingredient in bitter tonics. The curcuminoid 1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one, and the sesquiterpenes and epiprocurcumenol can be found in &quot;C. zedoaria&quot;.

<text>In the canon law of the Catholic Church, a distinction is made between the internal forum, where an act of governance is made without publicity, and the external forum, where the act is public and verifiable. In canon law, internal forum, the realm of conscience, is contrasted with the external or outward forum; thus, a marriage might be null and void in the internal forum, but binding outwardly, i.e., in the external forum, for want of judicial proof to the contrary.

==Etymology==

The judicial jurisdiction of the Catholic Church is expressed by the word &quot;Forum&quot;, the Latin designation for a place containing a tribunal of justice.

==Theoretical basis==

As the Church is a perfect society, she possesses within herself all the powers necessary to direct her members to the end for which she was instituted and she has a correlative right to be obeyed by those subject to her. This right is called jurisdiction, and it is the source of all the Church&#x27;s action that is not derived from the power of Sacred orders. It is this jurisdiction which is the foundation of ecclesiastical law, both externally and internally binding, and from Apostolic times it has been put into practice by the Church&#x27;s rulers. Just as the civil State has the legitimate jurisdiction over its subjects to guide them to the end for which it is instituted, because it is a perfect society, so likewise the Church, being constituted by Christ as a perfect society, possesses within itself all the powers necessary for lawfully and effectively attaining the end for which it was established.

==Internal forum &quot;vs&quot; external forum==
As the power of the Church extends not only to its individual members but also to the whole corporate body, not only to questions concerning the conscience but also to the public actions of its subjects, ecclesiastical jurisdiction is distinguished into that of the internal and external forum. It may so chance that circumstances may bring about a conflict between the internal and external forum. Thus, for example, a marriage may be null and void in the forum of conscience, but binding in the external forum for want of judicial proofs to the contrary, and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

==Internal forum==
The jurisdiction of the internal forum deals with questions concerning the welfare of individual Christians and with their relation to God. Hence it is called the forum of conscience (&quot;Forum conscientiae&quot;). It is also denominated the forum of Heaven (&quot;forum poli&quot;) because it guides the soul on the path to God. The internal forum is subdivided into the sacramental or penitential, which is exercised in the tribunal of penance or at least is connected with it, and the extra penitential forum. Causes concerning the private and secret needs of the faithful can often be expedited outside the sacramental confession. Thus, vows may be dispensed, secret censures may be absolved, occult impediments of matrimony may be dispensed outside of the tribunal of penance. The internal forum deals therefore directly with the spiritual welfare of the individual faithful. It has reference to the corporate body only secondarily, in as much as the good of the whole organization is promoted by that of the individual members. Owing to the nature of the civil state and the end for which it was instituted, it has no jurisdiction corresponding to the ecclesiastical forum of conscience.

===Sacramental and non-sacramental internal forum===
Within the internal forum a distinction is made between the sacramental internal forum and the non-sacramental (penitential) internal forum, according as matters are decided in the sacrament of Penance, and thus additionally protected by the Seal of the Confessional, or outside of the sacrament.

Thus the name of the parties in a marriage contracted in the external forum are noted in a public register, but a marriage celebrated secretly is to be noted instead in a special register kept in the secret archive of the diocesan curia.

Sometimes power of governance is given for the sacramental forum only: in each diocese a priest is to be appointed who has the faculty, which he cannot delegate to others, of &quot;absolving in the sacramental forum outsiders within the diocese and members of the diocese even outside the territory of the diocese from undeclared &quot;latae sententiae&quot; censures not reserved to the Apostolic See&quot;.

In the Roman Curia, the Apostolic Penitentiary has jurisdiction for matters of the internal forum, both sacramental and non-sacramental, but in some instances its decisions hold also in the external forum, as when, unless it states otherwise, a dispensation that it grants in the non-sacramental internal forum from an occult impediment to marriage, is sufficient even if the occult impediment later becomes public.

==External forum==
The Church&#x27;s jurisdiction in the external forum has reference to matters touching the public and social good of the corporate body. It corresponds, consequently, very closely to the powers exercised by civil magistrates in affairs belonging to their competence. While the external forum may busy itself with the concerns of individuals, it does so only in as far as these affect the public good. Thus the absolution of sins belongs to the internal forum, but the concession of the faculty for performing such absolution is an act of the external forum. The jurisdiction of the external forum is subdivided into voluntary and necessary. Voluntary, or extrajudicial, is that which a superior can exercise towards those who invoke his power, or even against those who are unwilling, but without his using the formalities prescribed in law. Necessary or contentious jurisdiction is that which the judge employs in punishing crimes or deciding disputes according to prescribed forms. In general, the acts of jurisdiction of the external forum are the decision of disputes concerning faith, morals or discipline, the making and enforcing of laws, the punishment of transgressors of ecclesiastical statutes, and the like.

==Competency==
The competence of the ecclesiastical forum arises either from the persons or the cause to be judged. As to persons, all clerics are subject to its judgments both in civil and criminal causes (see clerical immunities). As to causes: they may be purely civil, or ecclesiastical, or they may be mixed. Purely civil causes would not of themselves properly belong to the Church&#x27;s forum, as she recognizes the full competence of the state in such matters. Accidentally, however, such causes might be brought before the ecclesiastical judge. This supposes, however, the practical recognition of the Church&#x27;s forum by the civil power. Ecclesiastical causes themselves are called civil when they concern either spiritual things, as the sacraments, or matters connected with them, as church property, the right of patronage, etc. They are called criminal when they involve the dealing with delinquents guilty of simony, apostasy, schism and the like. They are called mixed causes when they are subjects proper for decision by either the ecclesiastical or civil forum, as usurious contracts, concubinage, violations of the Church&#x27;s peace, etc. Causes are likewise called mixed when they have both a spiritual and temporal end. Thus matrimony, in its sacramental nature as to validity or nullity, belongs to the Church; in its temporal aspect, as to the property of married persons and similar things, it may be dealt with by the civil tribunals. To this class of mixed causes can also be reduced the suppression of heresy, where Church and State cooperate with each other for the maintenance of the integrity or the faith and the preservation of the civil peace. Finally, many causes, of their nature civil, are accounted mixed by canonists, either because the State relinquished them to the Church&#x27;s tribunals or custom gradually caused them to be relegated to the ecclesiastical forum, such as the recognition of last wills and testaments, the care of the poor, etc.

==Punishments==
The punishments which may be inflicted by the external ecclesiastical forum are not only spiritual as excommunication, but also temporal or corporal.

As regards the infliction of the death penalty, canonists generally held that ecclesiastical law forbids inferior church tribunals to decree this punishment directly, but that the pope or a general council has the power, at least indirectly, in as much as they can demand that a Catholic state inflict this punishment when the good of the Church requires it. Finally, they held that there is no valid argument to prove that the direct exercise of this power does not fall within the competence of the ecclesiastical forum, although it was the custom of the latter to hand over the criminal to the secular arm for the infliction of the death penalty. However, death penalty was officially repudiated as a legitimate penalty by the Catholic Church in 2018.

The encroachments of the civil power on the Church&#x27;s jurisdiction have in our days, practically though unwarrantly, restricted the ecclesiastical forum to spiritual causes only.

==Oriental and Latin canon law==

The distinction between the internal forum and the external forum is recognized in canon 980 §1 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, which states

and in canon 130 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which states
==&quot;Internal forum solution&quot;==

The term &quot;internal forum&quot; is sometimes used in connection with the controversial so-called &quot;internal forum solution&quot; claimed to justify reception of Holy Communion by someone who is convinced that a former marriage was invalid, but who cannot prove this externally so as to obtain a declaration of nullity. This is not a canonical solution.

<text>TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; is a Clyde steamer launched in 1933 at the William Denny shipyard, Dumbarton, for Williamson-Buchanan Steamers. She is currently being restored as a museum ship, in Glasgow.

==Design and construction==
TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; originally measured 871 gross registered tons and was powered by three direct drive steam turbines built by Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company. The vessel held a passenger certificate for 2,086 passengers, later reduced to 1,820.

Following the completion of her trials during which a maximum speed of was achieved on the Skelmorlie measured mile, she joined Williamson-Buchanan&#x27;s fleet on 20 May 1933.

==Service history==
Williamson-Buchanan based TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; at Glasgow&#x27;s Bridge Wharf, where she carried approximately 13,000 passengers each week.

TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; sailed during the summer season for the Arran coast, or for the Kyles of Bute.

In 1935, Cunard Line asked Williamson-Buchanan to change the name of TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to TS &quot;Queen Mary II&quot;, in order to make the name available for their new flagship liner, which was due to be launched by Queen Mary. The owners of Williamson-Buchanan agreed and in exchange, Cunard Line presented them with a portrait of Her Majesty to hang in the forward lounge of the steamer.

In 1936, the entire Williamson-Buchanan fleet, including TS &quot;Queen Mary II&quot;, passed into the ownership of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company. Later that same year she joined Williamson-Buchanan Steamers (1936) Ltd.

During World War II she provided a mail and passenger service to the Scottish Islands.

She was refitted and repainted in LMS colours after the war and returned to her normal passenger service. In 1948, nationalisation of the railways brought all the remaining passenger ships under the ownership of the Caledonian Steam Packet Company. 

Over the winter of 1956-1957, Barclay Curle changed the fuelling of the propulsion system from coal to oil. This necessitated removing the two original Scotch boilers and replacing them with one new single ended boiler and the installation of one large, futuristic funnel in place of the original two. In addition, a new mainmast was added so that TS &quot;Queen Mary II&quot; now had the requisite two required to meet the new regulations for ship lighting. After all of this work was completed, the vessel&#x27;s tonnage increased to 1014 GRT.
In the 1960s, there was a decline in passenger sailings on the Firth of Clyde, but TS &quot;Queen Mary II&quot; continued in service and was refitted for cruises from Gourock to Inveraray, Brodick and Campbeltown. Regular sailings from Glasgow ended on 15 September 1969, with the Caledonian Steam Packet Company preferring to have her sail out of Gourock. 

From 1969 onwards, TS &quot;Queen Mary II&quot; was placed on almost all of the cruise rosters, and she sailed regularly to Inveraray, Campbeltown, Ailsa Craig, Bute and to Stranraer. However, in order that she could continue to undertake sailings from Bridge Wharf, her masts were shortened to fit under the newly constructed Kingston Bridge although subsequently Bridge Wharf closed prior to the bridge opening.

The Caledonian Steam Packet Company gradually had been merging with the West Highland ferry company David MacBrayne, and in 1973, the company became Caledonian MacBrayne.

In 1976, following the removal of RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; from Lloyd&#x27;s Register in a special ceremony on 4 May 1976, TS &quot;Queen Mary II&quot; was once again formally registered as TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. 

Whilst TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; remained very popular in the charter market, nonetheless she was over 40 years old and it was becoming apparent that some major work would be required to keep her in service. The decision was taken to retire the vessel from service and on 27 September 1977, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; undertook her final public sailing, before being laid up in the East India Harbour, Greenock.

==Retirement (1977–2009)==

In 1978, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was sold to Glasgow District Council, which planned to convert her to a museum. The Council, however, was unable to commit the necessary funding and so sold her on to Euroyachts (1980). In 1981 TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; again was sold, this time to Tesright Limited. 

Tesright relocated the ship to London, and she departed under the tow of the tug &quot;Pellmell Delta&quot; on 29 January 1981, arriving in London four days later.

In 1987, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was sold to Bass PLC. She underwent a £2.5M refurbishment and was moored at Victoria Embankment. Facilities included two bars and two function rooms, whilst the top deck of the ship was used as an open-air venue with bar facilities.

In November 2009, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was towed to Tilbury, to be prepared for a new life at La Rochelle. She had been purchased by Samuel Boudon, who planned to renovate her as a floating restaurant and fitness centre. However, by 2011, the venture had fallen through and she remained moored in Tilbury Docks, with an uncertain future

==2009 – 2015==
TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was auctioned by Capital Marine Services on 24 August 2011, and sold to Ranjan Chowdhury. He planned to restore the vessel to her 1930s glory. In 2012, the charity &quot;Friends of the TS Queen Mary&quot; was formed, with the clear goal of returning TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to a permanent berth in Glasgow. 

In February 2015, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was served with a prohibition notice by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, preventing her from leaving the Port of Tilbury until made seaworthy. Later that year, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was arrested by the Port of Tilbury Limited due to the non-payment of berthing dues by the owner, and once again faced the threat of being scrapped. 

Eventually the Port of Tilbury put the vessel up for auction, with Friends of TS Queen Mary&#x27;s bid which was funded by Jim McColl being accepted, the purchase being finalised in October 2015.

==Return to Scotland==
A campaign to undertake essential repairs was launched in December 2015, spearheaded by Robbie Coltrane and supported by the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;. Donations flooded in from across the UK and by March 2016 all of the funding required (£120,000) was in place. The repairs contract was awarded to Dales Marine (Garvel Clyde), and work started in April 2016.

Following a survey by the MCA, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; received a Loadline Exemption Certificate and was able to be towed from Tilbury back home to Scotland. On 15 May, the vessel arrived back on the Clyde and was berthed in James Watt Dock throughout the summer of 2016.
On 1 September 2016, following a campaign to raise £350,000, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was towed into Garvel Drydock for renovation works. On 1 October 2016, TS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; returned to James Watt Dock and on 9 November 2016, she left under tow for Glasgow on what would be her first visit to the city since 1977. She is now berthed at the entrance of Princes&#x27; Dock, at Glasgow Science Centre where she is undergoing a major refit to become a permanent heritage destination and education centre.

On 11 March 2022, the ship&#x27;s royal patron, the Princess Royal, announced that the refit would now be extended to allow &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to return to passenger cruising in 2024. The plans would now require re-engining.

<text>Oodaaq or Oodap Qeqertaa is a bank of gravel and silt northeast of Greenland that has been considered by some to be the northernmost point of land on Earth, though a number of other places have also been given that title since its discovery. It may have been created by the impact of an iceberg in a shallow sea. However, the area of ice in which it appears does not move from year to year. If it was created by an iceberg, then it must have happened long ago.

==Location==
Oodaaq lies at 83° 40′ North and 30° 40′ West, only south of the North Pole and north of Kaffeklubben Island, lying near the northeast tip of Greenland. When discovered it measured a mere .

== History ==
It was discovered in 1978 when a Danish survey team led by Uffe Petersen landed a helicopter on Kaffeklubben Island to confirm that it did indeed lie further north than the tip of Greenland. Having confirmed the fact, a member of the team noticed a dark spot northeast of Kaffeklubben Island. The survey team landed on the island in a helicopter and later named it Oodaaq after the Inuk who accompanied Robert Peary on his journey to the North Pole.

== Debate ==

Gravel banks such as this are generally considered not to qualify for the title of the world&#x27;s northernmost point of land as they are rarely permanent. In fact, several subsequent expeditions have claimed that Oodaaq has now disappeared beneath the ocean.

In July 1998, during an aerial reconnaissance flight, Peter Skafte photographed a small island farther north than any previously observed. In July 2003, Peter Skafte, Mara Boland, and Dennis Schmitt, and three others walked across the melting sea ice to the new island. It is located about north of Kaffeklubben Island, at about 83°42&#x27;N. Snow and ice had melted to reveal a bank of rocks and sand at a height of about . Later Ken Zerbst failed to locate the island in 2008 while using a helicopter.

In July 2001, the Return to the Top of the World Expedition came to the conclusion that the previously-discovered island and permanent land feature ATOW1996 was the northernmost point of land on Earth.

Several possible explanations exist for the failure to locate the island in 2008.

* The island may not be a permanent land feature connected to the bottom of the sea.

* Seasonal and yearly accumulation of snow and ice has rendered the island invisible.

* The island was discovered in a belt of multiyear fast ice, but global warming has eroded this layer of ice along the Greenland coast. Perhaps the island has been exposed to the force of the drift ice and &#x27;bulldozed&#x27; away.

* The GPS coordinates for the island&#x27;s location are most likely inaccurate. GPS satellites are low on the horizon near the North Pole, which may cause GPS to yield inaccurate results.

In late 2004, the Eighth Edition of the National Geographic World Atlas was released. It clearly shows Oodaaq as the northernmost landmass on Earth. In August 2005 and 2006, Peter Skafte, Allen Deforest (satellite engineer), and Paul Lommen (physicist) conducted a search for new islands north of Greenland, using high-resolution satellite images. 

Two sets of images were obtained, one year apart, to determine if any of the new islands had moved. One island was in diameter and visible on a satellite image, even without magnification. The team named it &quot;Skafte Island&quot; and posted it on a website. They also sent two reports about their findings to Hauge Anderson at the Danish Polar Center, one in 2005 and another in 2006. Dennis Schmitt was shown an image of &quot;Skafte Island&quot; before his departure with a group of people to North Greenland in 2007. He visited the island and made the claim that he had discovered a new northernmost island.

A number of other locations have since been called the northernmost point. In July 2021, scientists visited what they thought was Oodaaq, later discovering they had actually landed on a previously unknown island north-west of Oodaaq. The island measures approximately , with a maximum elevation of around . The scientists proposed the island be called &quot;Qeqertaq Avannarleq&quot;, Greenlandic for &quot;the northernmost island&quot;. Rene Forsberg, head of geodynamics at the National Space Institute in Denmark, said Qeqertaq Avannarleq is not a true island, likely rock on ice, as are all the other islets north of Kaffeklubben.

<text>Boston is an unincorporated community in, and the county seat of, Bowie County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 200 in 2000. It is part of the Texarkana metropolitan area.

==History==
In the mid-1880s, as the population of (Old) Boston declined, citizens of Texarkana successfully moved the county seat to their city in the extreme east of the county. Within five years, citizens of central and western Bowie County successfully proposed moving the county seat closer to the geographic center of the county. The new community began in 1890 with the construction of the County Courthouse, one mile south of New Boston and three miles north of the original Boston. The county seat was required to have a post office. After the first three proposed names, Center, Hood, and Glass were rejected as already in use, Boston&#x27;s post office (including its name) was relocated to the new county seat, while the original was relabeled &quot;Old Boston&quot;. In the 1980s, a new courthouse was built in New Boston, but Boston remained the county seat. Its population was recorded at 200 in 2000. Its population was also recorded as 175 from 1896 through the early 1990s. It had only two operating businesses in 1982.

The Bowie County jail in the community is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Boston is located off U.S. Highway 82 and the Missouri Pacific Railroad, west of Texarkana in central Bowie County.

==Education==
Boston is served by the New Boston Independent School District.

==Notable people==
* William Lee Estes, United States federal judge, was born in Boston.
* Jeff D. Leach, businessman and microbiome researcher, was born in Boston.
* Howell Washington Runnels Sr. Politician; was a store clerk in Boston.

<text>Ervin Johnson Jr. (born December 21, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player who is a community ambassador for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played in the NBA for the Seattle SuperSonics, Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks and Minnesota Timberwolves as a center from 1993 to 2006.

==Early life==
Johnson attended Block High School in Jonesville, Louisiana, where he played basketball until he quit in the 10th grade. Three years after high school, he worked at a Baton Rouge supermarket and grew 8 inches. A friend suggested that he try out for the New Orleans Privateers, which did not have a big man. Privateers head coach Tim Floyd offered Johnson a scholarship on sight despite Johnson not having played basketball in years.

==College career==
UNO recorded 87 victories during Johnson&#x27;s time in the program. They earned two NCAA tournament bids and one NIT tournament appearance. When he finished, he was the second all-time leading scorer in UNO history (1,608 points), first all-time in field goal percentage (59%), first all-time in double-doubles with 55, first all-time in rebounds with 1,287 (10.5 per game), third all-time in double-figure scoring games (81), eighth all-time in steals (109), second all-time in games played (123) and first all-time in blocks (294). Johnson was named All-American South Conference for the 1990–1991 season, All-Sun Belt Conference for the 1991–1992 season, and the 1992–1993 Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year.

Johnson completed his degree in general studies from the University of New Orleans during the 1996–97 NBA season, and was commencement speaker at graduation ceremonies.

===Honors===
Johnson was named Basketball Times 2nd Team All-American for 1992–93 and 3rd Team All-American by Basketball Weekly and United Press International. He was named Honorable Mention All-American for the same season by the Associated Press.

Johnson was named MVP of the NABC All-America Game in 1993.

On December 29, 1997, his Privateer jersey (40) was retired at Lakefront Arena.

In 2005, Johnson was named to the All-Time Men&#x27;s Basketball Team for the Sun Belt Conference in celebration of the conference&#x27;s 30th basketball season.

==Professional career==

A 6&#x27;11&quot;, 245-pound center from the University of New Orleans, Johnson was selected 23rd overall by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1993 NBA draft, and played for the Sonics, Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves and Milwaukee Bucks.

On February 14, 1996, Johnson scored a career-high 28 points, alongside grabbing 12 rebounds, in a win against the Timberwolves. Johnson and the Sonics would make it to the Finals that postseason, before losing to the Bulls.

The following season, after signing with the Nuggets, Johnson scored 19 points, grabbed 20 rebounds and blocked 5 shots on December 20 in a win against the Vancouver Grizzlies. That year, Johnson led the league in total defensive rebounds, with 682.

During the 1997 offseason, Johnson was traded to the Bucks for Danny Fortson, Johnny Newman, and Joe Wolf. On April 11, 1998, Johnson scored 24 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a loss against the New Jersey Nets.

Johnson played a key role on the 2000–01 Bucks, grabbing a playoff career-high 17 rebounds on May 15 against the Charlotte Hornets, and playing in every game of their playoff run leading up to their Game 7 loss (in which he started and played 42 minutes) in the Eastern Conference Finals against the 76ers.

Three years later, now in Minnesota and 36 years old, Johnson played an important role on another team&#x27;s deep playoff run. This time, he averaged 20 minutes a game in the playoffs, but still started most games en route to a Western Conference Finals loss to the Lakers.

Johnson returned to the Bucks for one season, and retired after the end of the 2006 NBA playoffs.

<text>The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (in case citations, E.D.N.Y.) is the federal district court whose territorial jurisdiction spans five counties in New York State: the four Long Island counties of Nassau, Suffolk, Kings (Brooklyn), and Queens, as well as Richmond (Staten Island), the latter three being among New York City&#x27;s five boroughs. The court also has concurrent jurisdiction with the Southern District of New York over the waters of New York (Manhattan) and Bronx Counties (including New York Harbor and the East River). Its courthouses are located in Brooklyn and Central Islip.

Appeals from the Eastern District of New York are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Eastern District of New York represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. The acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York since January 2025 is Carolyn Pokorny. The U.S. Marshal for the court is Vincent F. DeMarco.

== Courthouses ==
The main location is the Theodore Roosevelt United States Courthouse at 225 Cadman Plaza East in the civic center of Brooklyn. The 15-story building was designed by Cesar Pelli. The courthouse was designed in 1995 but did not open until 2006 following redesign requirements in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and the September 11 attacks. It replaced the six story Emanuel Celler Federal Building (built in 1962 and located next door and connected via glass atrium). In 2008 it was renamed for Theodore Roosevelt. The building was originally to be renamed in honor of former New York Governor Hugh Carey but politicians backed off because Carey was alive at the time. The associated prison is the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn.

The Divisional office is in the Alfonse M. D&#x27;Amato United States Courthouse in Central Islip, New York. The courthouse designed by Richard Meier opened in 2000 and is the largest building on Long Island. The 12-story building has , 23 courtrooms and 24 judges&#x27; chambers.
It is the third largest federal courthouse in the United States (after the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse and Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse).

<text>Gabrielle Nicole Logan (&quot;née&quot; Yorath; born 24 April 1973) is a Welsh television and radio presenter, and a former rhythmic gymnast who represented Wales and Great Britain. She hosted &quot;Final Score&quot; for BBC Sport from 2009 until 2013.

==Early life==
Gabrielle Nicole Yorath was born on 24 April 1973 in Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire to former Wales international footballer and manager Terry Yorath, who was playing for Leeds United at the time, and his wife, Christine. The family moved frequently because her father played for a number of British teams as well as in Canada with the Vancouver Whitecaps. She attended Cardinal Heenan High School and Notre Dame Sixth Form College in Leeds. She played netball at school and at university and also competed in the high jump, but the peak of her sporting career was when she placed 11th in rhythmic gymnastics representing Wales at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland. She became interested in football during her regular attendances at her father&#x27;s matches. Her mother went out of a &quot;sense of duty&quot;. Along with her brother and sister, she was in the crowd at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985, the day of the Bradford City stadium fire. She had left the stand only moments before the fire took hold and watched the unfolding disaster.

Her debut TV appearance was when she was chosen as the Leeds Rose for the 1991 Rose of Tralee competition.

==Early career==
After studying law at Durham University, Logan began presenting on Metro Radio in Newcastle, and on Tyne Tees Television on their Tonight programme, from where she was offered a job as a presenter on Sky Sports in 1996. She worked there until 1998, when she joined the ITV TV network.

<doc id="882410" wikidata="Q1193504" url="?curid=882410" title="Untouchable number">
<text>In mathematics, an untouchable number is a positive integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of all the proper divisors of any positive integer. That is, these numbers are not in the image of the aliquot sum function. Their study goes back at least to Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi (circa 1000 AD), who observed that both 2 and 5 are untouchable.

==Examples==
* The number 4 is not untouchable, as it is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of 9: 1 + 3 = 4.
* The number 5 is untouchable, as it is not the sum of the proper divisors of any positive integer: 5 = 1 + 4 is the only way to write 5 as the sum of distinct positive integers including 1, but if 4 divides a number, 2 does also, so 1 + 4 cannot be the sum of all of any number&#x27;s proper divisors (since the list of factors would have to contain both 4 and 2).
* The number 6 is not untouchable, as it is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of 6 itself: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The first few untouchable numbers are
:2, 5, 52, 88, 96, 120, 124, 146, 162, 188, 206, 210, 216, 238, 246, 248, 262, 268, 276, 288, 290, 292, 304, 306, 322, 324, 326, 336, 342, 372, 406, 408, 426, 430, 448, 472, 474, 498, ... .

==Properties==

The number 5 is believed to be the only odd untouchable number, but this has not been proven. It would follow from a slightly stronger version of the Goldbach conjecture, since the sum of the proper divisors of &quot;pq&quot; (with &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; distinct primes) is 1 + &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;. Thus, if a number &quot;n&quot; can be written as a sum of two distinct primes, then &quot;n&quot; + 1 is not an untouchable number. It is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes, so probably no odd number larger than 7 is an untouchable number, and formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, so only 5 can be an odd untouchable number. Thus it appears that besides 2 and 5, all untouchable numbers are composite numbers (since except 2, all even numbers are composite). No perfect number is untouchable, since, at the very least, it can be expressed as the sum of its own proper divisors. Similarly, none of the amicable numbers or sociable numbers are untouchable. Also, none of the Mersenne numbers are untouchable, since &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot; − 1 is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of 2&quot;n&quot;.

No untouchable number is one more than a prime number, since if &quot;p&quot; is prime, then the sum of the proper divisors of &quot;p&quot;2 is &quot;p&quot; + 1. Also, no untouchable number is three more than a prime number, except 5, since if &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime then the sum of the proper divisors of 2&quot;p&quot; is &quot;p&quot; + 3.

==Infinitude==
There are infinitely many untouchable numbers, a fact that was proven by Paul Erdős. According to Chen &amp; Zhao, their natural density is at least d &gt; 0.06.

<text>Dean Radin (; born February 29, 1952) is an american parapsychologist.

Following a bachelor and master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering and a PhD in educational psychology Radin worked at Bell Labs, as a researcher at Princeton University and the University of Edinburgh, and was a faculty member at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

He then became Chief Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in Petaluma, California, USA, later becoming the president of the Parapsychological Association. He is also co-editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;&quot;.

Radin&#x27;s paranormal ideas and work have been widely criticized by skeptic scientists and philosophers.

==Education==
Following a career in classical violin, Radin went on to earn an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as well as both a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering and a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After his graduation, Radin worked at Bell Labs, and then conducted research at Princeton University, GTE Laboratories, University of Edinburgh, SRI International, Interval Research Corporation, and was a faculty member at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

==Parapsychology==
Radin was elected president of the Parapsychological Association in 1988, 1993, 1998, and 2005, and has published a number of articles and papers supporting the existence of paranormal phenomena, as well as two books directed to a popular audience: &quot;The Conscious Universe&quot; and &quot;Entangled Minds&quot;. Radin believes that parapsychology is as repeatable as any scientific discipline, but that it is also, as paraphrased by sociologist Erich Goode, &quot;elusive, subtle and complex&quot;, a field of study that is &quot;difficult to replicate&quot; and that &quot;our understanding of it is incomplete&quot;.

Radin&#x27;s paranormal claims have been rejected by those in the skeptical and mainstream scientific communities, some of whom have suggested that Radin&#x27;s beliefs embrace pseudoscience and that he misunderstands the nature of science. The physicist Robert L. Park has written &quot;No proof of psychic phenomena is ever found. In spite of all the tests devised by parapsychologists like Jahn and Radin, and huge amounts of data collected over a period of many years, the results are no more convincing today than when they began their experiments.&quot;

Chris French criticized Radin for his selective historical overview of parapsychology and for ignoring clear evidence of fraud. French recounts that the medium Florence Cook was caught in acts of trickery and two of the Fox sisters confessed to fraud, but that Radin did not mention this fact. Radin has claimed the results from parapsychological research are as consistent by the same standards as any other scientific discipline, but Ray Hyman has written that many parapsychologists disagree with this, openly admitting that the evidence for parapsychology is &quot;inconsistent, irreproducible, and fails to meet acceptable scientific standards&quot;.

Radin and his colleagues have suggested that small-scale studies have produced a &quot;genuine psychokinetic effect&quot;, but critics have asserted that Radin has not shown evidence that the null hypothesis of such an effect could be confidently rejected. Further, psychologists David B. Wilson and William R. Shadish, writing in &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot;, criticized claims made by Radin and his associates that human minds can psychically influence random number generators, saying that parapsychologists &quot;need to go beyond statistics and explain how the mind might influence a computer, then test that prediction&quot;. Radin has appealed to quantum mechanics as a mechanism, claiming that it can explain the non-locality and backward causality associated with psi phenomena, though such ideas are harshly criticized by many physicists who study quantum mechanics as being pseudoscientific. Radin has written that not all people experience paranormal phenomena (or see ghosts) because they block such signals due to the process of latent inhibition.

==Books==
While Radin&#x27;s books have been reviewed favorably by groups that give general reviews such as &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, independent reviews by scientists and skeptics, as cited below, have often been negative.

===&quot;The Conscious Universe&quot;===
A critical review of &quot;The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena&quot; (1997) was published by the British mathematician I. J. Good in &quot;Nature&quot;. The review charged that Radin ignored the known hoaxes in the field, made statistical errors and ignored plausible non-paranormal explanations for parapsychological data. Good wrote about flaws in Radin&#x27;s method for evaluating the file-drawer effect. Radin replied to Good in a follow-up letter in the correspondence pages of &quot;Nature&quot;, saying that Good in his review had misinterpreted a reference to a probability value. Good replied, saying that most readers would not arrive at the same interpretation of what Radin had written noting that readers would be surprised to learn that by &quot;more than a billion trillion&quot;, Radin meant more than 10100&quot;. Further, Good noted that the file drawer effect does not account for intentional fraud, as was very probably the case with prominent ESP proponents such as Samuel Soal, nor is there any real means of estimating such &quot;intellectual, observational or ethical lapses&quot; within ESP. In 2002, Victor J. Stenger gave a criticism of &quot;The Conscious Universe&quot; that aligned with Good&#x27;s arguments that Radin did not perform the file-drawer analysis correctly, made fundamental errors in his calculations, and ignored non-paranormal explanations for the data.

The book was reviewed by the philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll in a thirteen-page chapter-by-chapter critique which noted how Radin had not cited the skeptical literature on the subject of parapsychology. Carroll stated that Radin had ignored &quot;the many hoaxes and frauds that dot the landscape in the history of psi research.&quot;

===&quot;Supernormal&quot;===
Radin&#x27;s book &quot;Supernormal: Science, Yoga, and the Evidence for Extraordinary Psychic Abilities&quot; (2013), argues support for psychic phenomena, linking them to the siddhis from yoga-related legends. Publishers Weekly has reviewed it, saying of the book, that it is &quot;unfocused and opaque at times&quot; but &quot;nevertheless an admirable attempt to bridge the gap between the scientific and the spiritual realm&quot;. The anonymous review by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; gave it a positive review saying &quot;certainly not for everyone, but a smart reminder that we haven’t got the whole scene covered&quot;.

Dale DeBakcsy, writing for the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, a bimonthly American general-audience magazine published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, reviewed &quot;Supernormal&quot; and criticized the work as &quot;misrepresenting report data, lowering success criteria, and playing a somewhat loose game with how rigorously confidence information is presented&quot;. Debakcsy examined Radin&#x27;s claim that a meta-analysis of forced choice recognition published in parapsychological literature showed that Psi effects were present above chance to a probability of 1015 to 1, noting that the study also reported that results varied wildly with an extremely unusual standard deviation, such that they dropped 10% of the most extreme variations which reduced the effect size. According to DeBakcsy, Radin chose not to report those variations.

Debakcsy also criticized Radin&#x27;s characterization of the results of a free-response experiment conducted at Princeton. Radin cited a test subject&#x27;s response when asked to describe the future location of a distant agent: 
&quot;A rather strange yet persistent image of [the agent] inside a large bowl—a hemispheric indentation in the ground of some smooth man-made materials like concrete or cement. No color. Possibly covered with a glass dome. Unusual sense of inside/outside simultaneity. That’s all. It’s a large bowl. If it was full of soup [the agent] would be the size of a large dumpling!&quot;
Radin wrote that the subject&#x27;s response &quot;successfully&quot; described the actual randomly selected location of the distant agent: the Radio telescope at Kitt Peak. Debakcsy noted that there are several radio telescopes at Kitt Peak, such as the Very Long Baseline Array, but that telescope does not match the description given. DeBakcsy contends that, while the ARO 12m Radio Telescope has some similar characteristics, it also differs in several aspects from the subject&#x27;s description. DeBakcsy further commented that, considering this is the best example out of 653 possible other tests made at Princeton, it is quite poor. Noting the spread of meta-analyses of the same studies (where the individual studies are weighted differently), have wildly varying odds returned (from trillions to one, to indistinguishable from chance), DeBakcsy argues that this undermines the reliance on meta-analysis in the work since they lack standardization.

<doc id="882416" wikidata="Q886025" url="?curid=882416" title="Blues dance">
<text>Blues dancing is a family of historical dances that developed alongside and were danced to blues music, or the contemporary dances that are danced in that aesthetic. It has its roots in African-American dance, which itself is rooted in sub-Saharan African music traditions and the historical dances brought to the United States by European immigrants.

Mura Dehn used the term &quot;The Blues&quot; in her documentary &quot;The Spirit Moves&quot;, Part 1, as the sub-section title of Chapter II, referencing different dance styles. African-American essayist and novelist Albert Murray used the term &quot;blues-idiom dance&quot; and &quot;blues-idiom dance movement&quot; in his book &quot;Stomping the Blues&quot;.

==History of blues dancing==
=== Background ===
Blues dancing originated in the dances brought to America by enslaved Africans, who followed sub-Saharan African music traditions. There is no documented evidence across the history of pre-colonial sub-Saharan African dance for sustained one-on-one mixed-gender partnered dancing; African cultures apparently considered this type of dancing to be inappropriate. 

Slavery in the United States had a great deal of influence on African-American dance, as people from widely disparate African cultures were thrown together during enslavement. As a result of this, their specific cultural traditions, including dances, were often lost or blended into a creolized African-American dance style. This dance style was also influenced by elements of British-European dances brought to the United States by European immigrants. Dance moves were passed down through generations of African Americans, revised and reworked, ultimately resulting in a specific African-American dance vocabulary. Over time, African-American dance became more formal than its African predecessors, but more energetic and dynamic than European dances. 

During the post-Reconstruction period of approximately 1875–1900, as Jim Crow Laws were passed in the American South, dance steps began to lose their association with religion and spirituality and became thought of as purely secular. The dances of working-class and lower-class black people relinquished some of their Euro-American characteristics. Dances in this era became associated with the expression of pleasure and sexuality with one&#x27;s partner, and the importance of community was de-emphasized. The African style of dancing while bent over moved towards a more upright stance.

=== Development of blues music ===

W. C. Handy, who wrote some of the first published blues songs, documented an early experience he had with blues music at a dance that took place in Cleveland, Mississippi, around 1905. A local band consisting of three Black men with battered string instruments played a &quot;haunting&quot; song: &quot;The dancers went wild.&quot; Later, Handy described a crowd&#x27;s enthusiastic response to his own band playing blues music in 1909: &quot;In the office buildings about, white folks pricked up their ears. Stenographers danced with their bosses. Everybody shouted for more.&quot; Later, he incorporated elements of habanera music into his blues music, because he had observed that Black people danced even more enthusiastically when these elements were present. In 1914, he played the song &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; for the first time. At the time, the tango was fashionable, so he used a tango-style introduction before transitioning suddenly into a blues style. As Handy recalled, after a moment&#x27;s hesitation, the audience threw themselves into the dance with abandon.

At this point, blues began to come into its own as a genre. A tune called &quot;Slow Drag Blues&quot;, composed by Snowden, was recorded c. 1915–19 by Dabney&#x27;s Band. According to Albert Murray, blues idiom-dance movement has nothing to do with sensual abandonment. &quot;Being always a matter of elegance [it] is necessarily a matter of getting oneself together. Practitioners of this style do not throw their bodies around; they do not cut completely loose. A loss of coolness and control places one squarely outside the tradition.&quot;

Dancing to blues music was sometimes called &quot;slow dragging&quot;, a term that was used by Black dancers in Chicago through the 1940s. By the 1960s, the term &quot;belly-rubbing&quot; had gained acceptance. In the 1970s, both Black and white people began to refer to very close slow dancing between couples simply as &quot;slow dancing&quot;. The degree of affection the partners had for each other generally determined how closely the partners danced, and there were widely varying levels of proficiency and styles of footwork.

In fact, the very nature of a vernacular dance culture ensures the survival of socially and culturally useful or valuable dances. Many of the steps specific to dances associated with popular blues songs of the 1920s were adapted for new musical structures in jazz, and new dance forms such as the lindy hop. Early African-American blues dances were very simple in their core movement and allowed for a wide variety of musical interpretation, embodying a black aesthetic approach to rhythm, movement and melody which permeated black music. They were often a simple one-step or two-step and though some movements may have been adapted and integrated into some mainstream popular dances, blues dancing as a distinct dance genre and social practice never became a specific focus for white America in the way that dances such as the Lindy Hop and Charleston have.

==Blues dancing style==
Blues dances as a genre have been said to share a certain aesthetic:
* An athletic and grounded body posture and movement, characterized by the weight being held on the balls of the feet, the knees bent, the hips pushed back, and the chest forward.
* An asymmetry and polyphonic look/feel to the body, characterized by an equality of body parts. No limb or part has precedence, but they all work together both in a simultaneous and serialized fashion. The focus and weight shifting moves through various parts of the body; poly-centric.
* Rhythmic movement. Not just a single rhythm being used in/with the body, multiple meters or rhythms are used. Articulated movement in the torso (chest, rib cage, pelvis, buttocks) identifying and emphasizing different rhythms.
* Improvisation between dancers and on their own movements. Based on the rhythm section of the band.
* A drawing of the beats, dancing in the space between the beats, pushing and pulling creating a sense of tension both in the body and the body moving through space, while remaining loose and relaxed.

=== Specific moves or dances ===
The Ballroom, referenced by documentary filmmaker Mura Dehn, was a slow dance done by Lindy Hoppers at the Savoy Ballroom to Blues music and ballads. It is a slower, fluid, but highly rhythmic dance, involving lots of spins, lifts, and dips. Famous Lindy Hopper Sugar Sullivan described it as romantic.

In the Fish Tail, the movement of the buttocks forms a variety of figure eights, an element that originated in African dance. African dance generally discourages close bodily contact, so the use of this move in partner dances in the United States was considered obscene when it was first introduced. The Funky Butt was a similar move that involved &quot;grinding&quot; the rear end around. The Squat and Mooche were also performed with hip movements. Similar dances were popular in New York City by 1913.

The Slow Drag in its various forms was first documented during, and danced to the music of, the ragtime era.

Snake Hips is a movement in which the knees are moved forward and back one by one, while keeping the feet together, resulting in movement of the hips. As in Ball the Jack, a similar move in which the knees are held together, this results in a rotation of the hips.

The Strut is extremely similar to dances seen in South Africa, Ghana, and Nigeria. Strutting was often associated with cakewalking, another historical African-American dance.

<text>Melville Island () is an island in the eastern Timor Sea, off the coast of the Northern Territory, Australia. Along with Bathurst Island and nine smaller uninhabited islands, it forms part of the group known as the Tiwi Islands, which are under the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory in association with the Tiwi Land Council as the regional authority.

==History==

Indigenous people have occupied the area that became the Tiwi Islands for at least 40,000 years. It is said that the first European to sight the island was Abel Tasman in 1644.

Explorer Phillip Parker King (son of governor of New South Wales Philip Gidley King) named it for Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville, first Lord of the Admiralty, who is also commemorated by the much larger Melville Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Shortly after this, the British made the first attempt to settle Australia&#x27;s north coast, at the short-lived Fort Dundas on Melville Island. The settlement lasted from 1824 to 1828.

There was a Catholic mission on the island, on which Nova Peris&#x27; mother was raised after being taken from her mother.

During World War II the small Snake Bay Patrol manned by local Tiwi people was established as part of the military forces deployed to protect the island against any Japanese landings.

==Geography and climate==
The island lies in the eastern Timor Sea, approximately north of Darwin and west of the Cobourg Peninsula in Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory. At , it is just outside the 100 largest islands in the world, but is the second biggest island of Australia, after Tasmania. Irrititu Island, , lies south of Melville Island&#x27;s southern tip. The islands have a tropical climate.

==Population==
The largest settlement on the island is Milikapiti, with a population of 559. The second largest is Pirlangimpi (Pularumpi, formerly Garden Point), with a population of 440, located west of Milikapiti, on the west coast of Melville Island. About 30 more people live in five family outstations.

==Governance==
As part of the Tiwi Islands, Melville is under the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory, with the Tiwi Land Council as the regional authority.

<text>Kaffeklubben Island or Coffee Club Island (; ) is an uninhabited island lying off the northern shore of Greenland. It contains the northernmost undisputed point of land on Earth.
==History==
Kaffeklubben Island does not appear to have ever been inhabited. The northern part of Peary Landknown as &quot;Johannes J. Jensen Land&quot; was at least visited by members of the Thule peoples, based on archaeological evidence found in 2023 near Bliss Bay, approximately south. The nearest ruins from the older Independence I culture are located at Cape Bridgman, some to the southeast. 

The first recorded sighting of Kaffeklubben Island was made by the American explorer Robert Peary in 1900, who believed that Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was the world&#x27;s northernmost point of land and who declined to name the island. The island itself was not visited until 1921, when the Danish explorer Lauge Koch set foot on the island and named it after the coffee club in the University of Copenhagen Geological Museum.

In 1969, a Canadian team calculated that the island&#x27;s northernmost tip is farther north than Cape Morris Jesup, the northernmost point of mainland Greenland, thus claiming its record as the most northerly point of land.

In 2023, an American and Greenlandic team sponsored by National Geographic visited to study the flora and fauna, and establish the northernmost terrestrial ecosystem study in the world.

===Other claimants for northernmost land===
Since its record as the northernmost point of land was established, several gravel banks have been discovered in the sea to the north of the island, such as Oodaaq, 83-42, and ATOW1996; however, there is debate as to whether such gravel banks should be considered for the record since they rarely are permanent, being swallowed regularly by the moving ice sheets, being shifted in tides, or becoming submerged in the ocean. A bathymetric survey in 2022 determined that all gravel banks north of Kaffeklubben are likely not connected to the seafloor, but rather gravel on top of the sea ice, confirming Kaffeklubben as the northernmost true land in the world.

==Geography and geology==

Kaffeklubben Island is from the geographic North Pole. The island lies off Cape James Hill, northwest of Bliss Bay, approximately east of Cape Morris Jesup, a little east of a central point along the northern coast of Greenland. Its most northerly point is 4.4 km north of that of Cape Morris Jesup. It is approximately long, and approximately across at its widest point. The highest point is approximately above sea level.

===Flora and fauna===
Despite the harsh environment, vegetation grows on Kaffeklubben island, including various mosses, liverworts, lichens, and the flowering plants: &quot;Saxifraga oppositifolia&quot; (purple saxifrage) and &quot;Papaver radicatum&quot; (arctic poppy). The aforementioned National Geographic 2023 expedition determined that the northernmost life was a species of Tortula moss (&quot;Tortula mucronifolia&quot;) and an Arctic poppy (&quot;Papaver radicatum&quot;).

<text>Bathurst Island () (, ) is one of the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory off the northern coast of Australia along with Melville Island.
==Description==

The largest settlement on Bathurst is Wurrumiyanga (known as Nguiu until 2010), in the south-east, with a population of around 1,560. Located on the south east corner of Bathurst Island, Wurrumiyanga is approximately north of Darwin. The second largest settlement is Wurakuwu, with a population of 50, located northwest of Wurrumiyanga. The third settlement on the island is a small family outstation called &quot;4 Mile Camp&quot;, about west of Wurrumiyanga.

==History==

Aboriginal Australians have occupied the area that became the Tiwi Islands for at least 40,000 years.

On 5 May 1623, Willem Jootszoon Van Colster (or Coolsteerdt), in the ship &quot;Arnhem&quot; named the island De Speult Eylandt, in honour of Herman van Speult, Governor of Ambon, who had commissioned the voyage of exploration.

In 1828, the island was named Bathurst Island by Scottish explorer John Clements Wickham, after the explorer Phillip Parker King&#x27;s ship which had explored the area in August 1821. He named the island during a voyage in March 1838 when he was second in command of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; in Charles Darwin&#x27;s expedition. The ship&#x27;s name honours Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, (1762-1834), former British Secretary of State for the Colonies.

From 1910 to 1938 the island was the site of the Roman Catholic mission of Francis Xavier Gsell, known as the &quot;Bishop with 150 wives&quot; for his practice of &quot;buying&quot; girls betrothed to older men, thus making it possible for them to marry men of their own age.

On 24 December 1912 the whole island was proclaimed an Aboriginal reserve, under the &quot;Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910&quot;. A series of documents show that previous to the proclamation (published in the &quot;Commonwealth Gazette&quot; on 18 January 1913), there had been discussion about two parcels of land on the island. One was the allocation of allocated to the Mission, which would continue on annual leases, and the second regarding which was previously allocated as Crown Land under the &quot;Northern Territory Tropical Products Act 1904&quot;, for the production of cotton and other tropical crops. The correspondence shows that this was decided to be undesirable from the point of view of the Aboriginal people, both because of the bad influence of white men and the need to import labour to use on the leases.

Before the bombing of Darwin, a Missionary of the Sacred Heart priest, Ed Bennett, saw the approaching Japanese bombers, and urged the resident coastwatcher, John Gribble, to send a warning to Darwin, but Gribble refused. He said it would have to be sent in code, and he did not have the relevant code books. The first wave of 188 Japanese planes was also spotted by another missionary on the island, Father John McGrath, who sent a message on the radio saying &quot;An unusually large air formation bearing down on us from the northwest&quot;. However, ten US P-40E Kittyhawk fighters were returning to Darwin after aborting a mission to Timor due to bad weather, and the Australian duty officer assumed this was the same formation, and the warning was not acted upon.

== Climate ==
Bathurst Island has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;) with a very hot, rainy season from mid-October to April and a relatively cool, dry season from May to mid-October.

==In film==
Bathurst Island was depicted as Mission Island in the 2008 Baz Luhrmann film &quot;Australia&quot;. In the film, Japanese infantrymen land on the island; however, the presence of Japanese troops on the island is entirely fictional, as no such landing by the Japanese was made during World War II.

<doc id="882424" wikidata="Q3376512" url="?curid=882424" title="Practical reason">
<text>In philosophy, practical reason is the use of reason to decide how to act. It contrasts with theoretical reason, often called speculative reason, the use of reason to decide what to follow. For example, agents use practical reason to decide whether to build a telescope, but theoretical reason to decide which of two theories of light and optics is the best.

==Overview==
Practical reason is understood by most philosophers as determining a plan of action. Thomistic ethics defines the first principle of practical reason as &quot;good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided.&quot; For Kant, practical reason has a law-abiding quality because the categorical imperative is understood to be binding one to one&#x27;s duty rather than subjective preferences. Utilitarians tend to see reason as an instrument for the satisfactions of wants and needs.

In classical philosophical terms, it is very important to distinguish three domains of human activity: theoretical reason, which investigates the truth of contingent events as well as necessary truths; practical reason, which determines whether a prospective course of action is worth pursuing; and productive or technical reason, which attempts to find the best means for a given end. Aristotle viewed philosophical activity as the highest activity of the human being and gave pride of place to metaphysics or wisdom. Since Descartes practical judgment and reasoning have been treated with less respect because of the demand for greater certainty and an infallible method to justify beliefs.

Practical reasoning is basically goal-directed reasoning from an agent&#x27;s goal, and from some action selected as a means to carry out the goal, to the agent&#x27;s reasoned decision to carry out the action. The agent can be a person or a technical device, such as a robot or a software device for multi-agent communications. It is a type of reasoning used all the time in everyday life and all kinds of technology where autonomous reasoning is required. Argumentation theorists have identified two kinds of practical reasoning: &quot;instrumental practical reasoning&quot; that does not explicitly take values into account, and &quot;value-based practical reasoning&quot;. The following argumentation scheme for instrumental practical reasoning is given in . The pronoun &quot;I&quot; represents an autonomous agent.

===Argumentation scheme for instrumental practical reasoning===
Critical questions

:CQ1: What other goals do I have that should be considered that might conflict with G?
:CQ2: What alternative actions to my bringing about A that would also bring about G should be considered?
:CQ3: Among bringing about A and these alternative actions, which is arguably the most efficient?
:CQ4: What grounds are there for arguing that it is practically possible for me to bring about A?
:CQ5: What consequences of my bringing about A should also be taken into account?

It can be seen from CQ5 that argumentation from consequences is closely related to the scheme for practical reasoning.
It has often been disputed in philosophy whether practical reasoning is purely instrumental or whether it needs to be based on values. Argument from values is combined with practical reasoning in the type of argumentation called value-based practical reasoning. The following argumentation scheme for value-based practical reasoning is given in .

===Argumentation scheme for value-based practical reasoning===

:In the current circumstances R
:we should perform action A
:to achieve New Circumstances S
:which will realize some goal G
:which will promote some value V.

Practical reasoning is used in arguments, but also in explanations used to draw conclusions about an agent&#x27;s goals, motives or intentions, based on reports of what the agent said or did.

Practical reasoning is centrally important in artificial intelligence, and also vitally important in many other fields such as law, medicine and engineering. It has been known as a distinctive type of argumentation as far back as Aristotle.

<doc id="882425" wikidata="Q2014846" url="?curid=882425" title="Odyssey 5">
<text>Odyssey 5 is a Canadian science fiction television series, which was shown in 2002 on Space in Canada and on Showtime in the United States. The premise involves five space travelers who witness the destruction of the Earth; they are given the opportunity to travel to the past to identify and prevent the cataclysm.

&quot;Odyssey 5&quot; was created by Manny Coto, who was a scriptwriter and executive producer during the series run. Through his website and in interviews, Coto expressed his interest in returning to the series at some point, either continuing it or giving it a conclusion.

The series was produced in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

== Plot ==
The story follows six people, four astronauts, a scientist and a television news reporter, on a routine flight of the space shuttle &quot;Odyssey&quot; on 7 August 2007. During the flight, the Earth rapidly dissolves into a fiery ball and implodes. Control of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; is momentarily lost and one astronaut is killed. The remaining five crew members resign themselves to death, but an inorganic being called the Seeker rescues them. The Seeker tells them that 50 other worlds have been destroyed in the same way as Earth and the Seeker has always arrived too late to observe it. This is the first time he has found survivors. He offers to send them five years into the past (to 2002, the year the series was shown) so that they can prevent the disaster. He sends only their consciousnesses back because physical time travel is impossible. The mission commander learns a codeword associated with the disaster: Leviathan.

The villains are a race of disembodied artificial intelligences known as &quot;Sentients&quot;. They are trying to learn about humanity through artificial humanoid robots called &quot;Synthetics&quot;, which are nearly indistinguishable from humans. Another group of Synthetics is discovered to be from Mars. In the original timeline, a previous race of Synthetics created by humanity was destroyed by a secret US government agency. Whether the destruction of the Earth was retaliation for this act by the Sentients is never revealed.

While they search for the truth, the team must also revisit their pasts while retaining past knowledge of what is to come. Reporter Sarah Forbes tries to save her five-year-old son, who died of cancer in the original timeline. Her efforts in this direction alienate her husband, who leaves her and takes their son with him. Astronaut Angela Perry must deal with the knowledge that her father is a corrupt U.S. senator whose malfeasance destroyed her family in the original timeline. Commander Chuck Taggart must try to keep his family together. His son, Neil, a computer technician on the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, must adjust to being 17 again when he was a poor student who had not yet discovered his talents. Pessimistic scientist Kurt Mendel believes they cannot change history and spends his time indulging every desire.

The series characters are not friends and frequently disagree. The humanity of the team is shown through arguments, jokes and their attempts to maintain social lives and help the world with their limited knowledge of the future.

Many of the show&#x27;s plotlines involve technologies like AI, nanotechnology and neuroimaging.

A recurring theme is that the actions of the group may hasten the cataclysm they are trying to avoid or alter history in undesirable ways. A character who was supposed to live until 2007 dies in the first episode after helping the group. In one episode, Sarah and Angela protect a girl they know will be kidnapped. Although this prevents that individual&#x27;s kidnapping, the kidnapper takes a different child. Kurt makes a large bet on a football game whose outcome is already known to him, but the pressure of knowing has a negative effect on a player instrumental in winning the game, and the team loses.

==Cast==
*Peter Weller – Chuck Taggart, commander of the Odyssey mission and leader of the group when they jump back to the past.
*Sebastian Roché – Kurt Mendel, Nobel Prize-winning behavioral geneticist whose atheistic outlook and hedonistic tendencies often bring comic relief to the story.
*Christopher Gorham – Neil Taggart, Chuck&#x27;s son. NASA&#x27;s youngest astronaut at age 22, he succeeded where his older brother, Marc, had failed. He constantly has to deal with the struggles of growing up again and the repercussions that came with his high school delinquencies.
*Tamara Marie Watson – Angela Perry, an astronaut who was rendered unconscious when the Earth imploded, waking up disoriented five years in the past, in her MMU about to burn up in the atmosphere. Her issues following their return have a repercussion on her career, altering her future.
*Leslie Silva – Sarah Forbes, a reporter who tagged along with the Odyssey for a report, finding herself back before her son died from cancer and threatening to tear her family apart through her determination not to let him die again.
*Gina Clayton – Paige Taggart, the matriarch who struggles to believe that her husband and son are time travelers.

<text>The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (in case citations, N.D.N.Y.) serves one of the 94 judicial districts in the United States and one of four in the state of New York. Appeals from the Northern District of New York are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which has jurisdiction over the four districts of New York, the District of Connecticut and the District of Vermont (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). The U.S. attorney for the district is Carla B. Freedman since October 8, 2021.

Its jurisdiction comprises the counties of Albany, Broome, Cayuga, Chenango, Clinton, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Montgomery, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, St. Lawrence, Tioga, Tompkins, Ulster, Warren, and Washington.

The court&#x27;s main offices are in Syracuse, however, the court has additional offices in Albany, Binghamton, Plattsburgh, and Utica. The court also maintains facilities in Watertown. The court accepts filings from members of the bar through an automated case management system CM/ECF over the Internet.

== History ==
The first federal court district formed under the sovereignty of the United States was the District of New York. The District Court for the District of New York convened on November 3, 1789, with Judge James Duane presiding. On April 9, 1814, that original district split into the Northern and Southern Districts of New York; the first federal judge of the District Court for the Northern District of New York was Matthias Burnett Tallmadge. The Northern District&#x27;s western area split off in 1900 and became the Western District of New York. The Northern District now covers thirty-two counties in upstate New York, and it shares its long northern border with Canada.

<doc id="882427" wikidata="Q1841499" url="?curid=882427" title="Categorial grammar">
<text>Categorial grammar is a family of formalisms in natural language syntax that share the central assumption that syntactic constituents combine as functions and arguments. Categorial grammar posits a close relationship between the syntax and semantic composition, since it typically treats syntactic categories as corresponding to semantic types. Categorial grammars were developed in the 1930s by Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and in the 1950s by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel and Joachim Lambek. It saw a surge of interest in the 1970s following the work of Richard Montague, whose Montague grammar assumed a similar view of syntax. It continues to be a major paradigm, particularly within formal semantics.

A categorial grammar consists of two parts: a lexicon, which assigns a set of types (also called categories) to each basic symbol, and some type inference rules, which determine how the type of a string of symbols follows from the types of the constituent symbols. It has the advantage that the type inference rules can be fixed once and for all, so that the specification of a particular language grammar is entirely determined by the lexicon.

A categorial grammar shares some features with the simply typed lambda calculus.
Whereas the lambda calculus has only one function type formula_1,
a categorial grammar typically has two function types, one type that is applied on the left,
and one on the right. For example, a simple categorial grammar might have two function types formula_2 and formula_3.
The first, formula_2, is the type of a phrase that results in a phrase of type
formula_5 when followed (on the right) by a phrase of type formula_6.
The second, formula_7, is the type of a phrase that results
in a phrase of type formula_5 when preceded (on the left) by a phrase of type 
formula_6.

The notation is based upon algebra. A fraction when multiplied by (i.e. concatenated with) its denominator yields its numerator. As concatenation is not commutative, it makes a difference whether the denominator occurs to the left or right. The concatenation must be on the same side as the denominator for it to cancel out.

The first and simplest kind of categorial grammar is called a basic categorial grammar, or sometimes an AB-grammar (after Ajdukiewicz and Bar-Hillel).
Given a set of primitive types formula_10, let 
formula_11 be the set of types constructed from primitive types. In the basic case, this is the least set such that formula_12
and if formula_13
then formula_14.
Think of these as purely formal expressions freely generated from the primitive types; any semantics will be added later. Some authors assume a fixed infinite set of primitive types used by all grammars, but by making the primitive types part of the grammar, the whole construction is kept finite.

A basic categorial grammar is a tuple formula_15
where formula_16 is a finite set of symbols,
formula_10 is a finite set of primitive types, and formula_18.

The relation formula_19 is the lexicon, which relates types to symbols formula_20.
Since the lexicon is finite, it can be specified by listing a set of pairs like formula_21.

Such a grammar for English might have three basic types formula_22, assigning count nouns the type formula_23, complete noun phrases the type
formula_24, and sentences the type formula_25.
Then an adjective could have the type formula_26, because if it is followed by a noun then the whole phrase is a noun. 
Similarly, a determiner has the type formula_27,
because it forms a complete noun phrase when followed by a noun.
Intransitive verbs have the type formula_28, and transitive verbs the type formula_29.
Then a string of words is a sentence if it has overall type formula_25.

For example, take the string &quot;the bad boy made that mess&quot;. Now &quot;the&quot; and &quot;that&quot; are determiners, &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;mess&quot; are nouns, &quot;bad&quot; is an adjective, and &quot;made&quot; is a transitive verb, so the lexicon is
{formula_31,
formula_32,
formula_33,
formula_34,
formula_35,
formula_36}.

and the sequence of types in the string is

formula_37

now find functions and appropriate arguments and reduce them according to the two inference rules
formula_38 and
formula_39:

formula_40&lt;br&gt;
formula_41&lt;br&gt;
formula_42&lt;br&gt;
formula_43&lt;br&gt;
formula_44&lt;br&gt;
formula_45

The fact that the result is formula_25 means that the string is a sentence, while the sequence of reductions shows that it can be parsed as ((the (bad boy)) (made (that mess))).

Categorial grammars of this form (having only function application rules) are equivalent in generative capacity to context-free grammars and are thus often considered inadequate for theories of natural language syntax. Unlike CFGs, categorial grammars are lexicalized, meaning that only a small number of (mostly language-independent) rules are employed, and all other syntactic phenomena derive from the lexical entries of specific words.

Another appealing aspect of categorial grammars is that it is often easy to assign them a compositional semantics, by first assigning interpretation types to all the basic categories, and then associating all the derived categories with appropriate function types. The interpretation of any constituent is then simply the value of a function at an argument. With some modifications to handle intensionality and quantification, this approach can be used to cover a wide variety of semantic phenomena.

==Lambek calculus==

A Lambek grammar is an elaboration of this idea that has a
concatenation operator for types, and several other inference rules.
Mati Pentus has shown that these still have the generative capacity of
context-free grammars.

For the Lambek calculus, there is a type concatenation
operator formula_47, so
that formula_12
and if formula_13
then formula_50.

The Lambek calculus consists of several deduction rules, which specify
how type inclusion assertions can be derived. In the following
rules, upper case roman letters stand for types, upper case Greek
letters stand for sequences of types. A sequent of the form
formula_51
can be read: a string is of type if it consists of the concatenation
of strings of each of the types in . If a type is
interpreted as a set of strings, then the
← may be interpreted as ⊇,
that is, &quot;includes as a subset&quot;. 
A horizontal line means that the inclusion above the line
implies the one below the line.

The process is begun by the Axiom rule, which has no antecedents and
just says that any type includes itself.

:formula_52

The Cut rule says that inclusions can be composed.

:formula_53

The other rules come in pairs, one pair for each type construction
operator, each pair consisting of one rule for the operator in the
target, one in the source, of the arrow.
The name of a rule consists of the operator and an arrow, with the
operator on the side of the arrow on which it occurs in the conclusion.

For an example, here is a derivation of &quot;type raising&quot;, which says that
formula_54. The names of rules and the substitutions used are to the right.

:formula_55

===Relation to context-free grammars===

Recall that a context-free grammar is a 4-tuple formula_56 where

# formula_57 is a finite set of &quot;non-terminals&quot; or &quot;variables&quot;.
# formula_58 is a finite set of &quot;terminal symbols&quot;.
# formula_59 is a finite set of production rules, that is, a finite relation formula_60.
# formula_61 is the start variable.

From the point of view of categorial grammars, a context-free grammar can be seen as a calculus with a set of special purpose axioms for
each language, but with no type construction operators and no inference rules except Cut.

Specifically, given a context-free grammar as above, define a categorial grammar 
formula_62
where formula_63,
and formula_64. 
Let there be an axiom
formula_65 for every symbol 
formula_66,
an axiom formula_67 
for every production rule formula_68,
a lexicon entry formula_69 for every terminal symbol 
formula_70,
and Cut for the only rule.
This categorial grammar generates the same language as the given CFG.

Of course, this is not a basic categorial grammar, since it has special axioms that depend upon the language; i.e. it is not lexicalized.
Also, it makes no use at all of non-primitive types.

To show that any context-free language can be generated by a basic categorial grammar, recall that 
any context-free language can be generated by a context-free grammar in Greibach normal form.

The grammar is in Greibach normal form if every production rule is of the form
formula_71,
where capital letters are variables, formula_70,
and formula_73,
that is, the right side of the production is a single terminal symbol
followed by zero or more (non-terminal) variables.

Now given a CFG in Greibach normal form,
define a basic categorial grammar with a primitive type
for each non-terminal variable
formula_74,
and with an entry in the lexicon 
formula_75,
for each production rule
formula_71.
It is fairly easy to see that this basic categorial grammar
generates the same language as the original CFG.
Note that the lexicon of this grammar will generally
assign multiple types to each symbol.

The same construction works for Lambek grammars, since they are an extension of basic categorial grammars. It is necessary to verify that the extra inference rules do not change the generated language. This can be done and shows that every context-free language is generated by some Lambek grammar.

To show the converse, that every language generated by a Lambek grammar is context-free, is much more difficult.
It was an open problem for nearly thirty years, from the early 1960s until about 1991 when it was proven by Pentus.

The basic idea is, given a Lambek grammar,
formula_62
construct a context-free grammar
formula_78
with the same set of terminal symbols, the same start symbol, with variables some (not all) types
formula_79,
and with a production rule
formula_80
for each entry
formula_81
in the lexicon, and production rules formula_82 for certain sequents formula_83 that are derivable in the Lambek calculus.

Of course, there are infinitely many types and infinitely many derivable sequents, so in
order to make a finite grammar it is necessary put a bound on the size of the types and sequents
that are needed. The heart of Pentus&#x27;s proof is to show that there is such a finite bound.

===Notation===
The notation in this field is not standardized. The notations used in
formal language theory, logic, category theory, and linguistics, conflict
with each other. In logic, arrows point to the more general from the more particular,
that is, to the conclusion from the hypotheses. In this article,
this convention is followed, i.e. the target of the arrow is the more general (inclusive) type.

In logic, arrows usually point left to right. In this article this convention is
reversed for consistency with the notation of context-free grammars, where the
single non-terminal symbol is always on the left. We use the symbol formula_84
in a production rule as in Backus–Naur form. Some authors use an arrow, which
unfortunately may point in either direction, depending on whether the grammar is
thought of as generating or recognizing the language.

Some authors on categorial grammars write formula_85 instead of
formula_3. The convention used here follows Lambek and algebra.

==Historical notes==
The basic ideas of categorial grammar date from work by Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (in 1935) and other scholars from the Polish tradition of mathematical logic including Stanisław Leśniewski, Emil Post and Alfred Tarski. Ajdukiewicz&#x27;s formal approach to syntax was influenced by Edmund Husserl&#x27;s pure logical grammar, which was formalized by Rudolph Carnap. It represents a development in the historical idea of universal logical grammar as an underlying structure of all languages. A core concept of the approach is the substitutability of syntactic categories—hence the name categorial grammar. The membership of an element (e.g., word or phrase) in a syntactic category (word class, phrase type) is established by the commutation test, and the formal grammar is constructed through series of such tests.

The term categorial grammar was coined by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (in 1953). In 1958, Joachim Lambek introduced a syntactic calculus that formalized the function type constructors along with various rules for the combination of functions. This calculus is a forerunner of linear logic in that it is a substructural logic.

Montague grammar is based on the same principles as categorial grammar. Montague&#x27;s work helped to bolster interest in categorial grammar by associating it with his highly successful formal treatment of natural language semantics. Later work in categorial grammar has focused on the improvement of syntactic coverage. One formalism that has received considerable attention in recent years is Steedman and Szabolcsi&#x27;s combinatory categorial grammar, which builds on combinatory logic invented by Moses Schönfinkel and Haskell Curry.

There are a number of related formalisms of this kind in linguistics, such as type logical grammar and abstract categorial grammar.

==Some definitions==
;Derivation: A derivation is a binary tree that encodes a proof.
;Parse tree: A parse tree displays a derivation, showing the syntactic structure of a sentence.
;Functor and argument: In a right (left) function application, the node of the type A\B (B/A) is called the functor, and the node of the type A is called an argument.
;Functor–argument structure{{clarify| where&#x27;s the definition?|date=July 2015}}

==Refinements of categorical grammar==
A variety of changes to categorial grammar have been proposed to improve syntactic coverage. Some of the most common are listed below.

===Features and subcategories===
Most systems of categorial grammar subdivide categories. The most common way to do this is by tagging them with features, such as person, gender, number, and tense. Sometimes only atomic categories are tagged in this way. In Montague grammar, it is traditional to subdivide function categories using a multiple slash convention, so &quot;A/B&quot; and &quot;A//B&quot; would be two distinct categories of left-applying functions, that took the same arguments but could be distinguished between by other functions taking them as arguments.

===Function composition===
Rules of function composition are included in many categorial grammars. An example of such a rule would be one that allowed the concatenation of a constituent of type &quot;A/B&quot; with one of type &quot;B/C&quot; to produce a new constituent of type &quot;A/C&quot;. The semantics of such a rule would simply involve the composition of the functions involved. Function composition is important in categorial accounts of conjunction and extraction, especially as they relate to phenomena like right node raising. The introduction of function composition into a categorial grammar leads to many kinds of derivational ambiguity that are vacuous in the sense that they do not correspond to semantic ambiguities.

===Conjunction===
Many categorial grammars include a typical conjunction rule, of the general form &quot;X CONJ X → X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is a category. Conjunction can generally be applied to nonstandard constituents resulting from type raising or function composition..

===Discontinuity===
The grammar is extended to handle linguistic phenomena such as discontinuous idioms, gapping and extraction.

<text>Hans Anders Rausing, KBE (25 March 1926 – 30 August 2019) was a Swedish industrialist and philanthropist based in the United Kingdom. He made his fortune from his co-inheritance of Tetra Pak, a company founded by his father Ruben Rausing, and the largest food packaging company in the world. In the early 1980s Rausing moved to the United Kingdom to avoid Swedish taxes, in 1995 he sold his share of the company to his brother, Gad. In the &quot;Forbes&quot; world fortune ranking, Rausing was placed at number 83 with an estimated fortune of US$10 billion in 2011. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, he was the second richest Swedish billionaire in 2013. By the time of his death in August 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the net worth of Rausing and his family to be $12 billion.

==Early life==
Rausing was born in Gothenburg in 1926, the second son of industrialist Ruben Rausing and his wife Elisabeth (née Varenius). Rausing had two brothers, Gad and Sven.

==Career==
Rausing studied Economics, Statistics and Russian at Lund University, graduating in 1948. In 1954, Rausing was appointed managing director of Tetra Pak and his brother Gad deputy managing director. Rausing became chairman in 1985. He left the company in 1993, and sold his 50% share of the company to Gad in 1995.

Tetra Pak&#x27;s success in the 1970s and 1980s has been credited to the leadership of Hans and Gad Rausing, who turned the six-person family business into a multinational company. Over the course of his career, Rausing became a specialist in Russian affairs and made many investments in Russia and Ukraine. He was responsible for Tetra Pak&#x27;s Russian market, and negotiated the first Tetra Pak machine export to the Soviet Union in 1959, eventually making Tetra Pak the largest foreign employer in Russia.

==Patronage==
Hans Rausing and his wife Märit donated large sums to charities and research in the UK and Sweden, among others to large medical research projects at Karolinska Institutet and Lund University. Through the Märit and Hans Rausing Fund, they supported local community projects in their home county of Sussex.

Through her fund Arcadia, Rausing&#x27;s daughter Lisbet is financing the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London, the Hans Rausing Scholarship in the History of Science at King&#x27;s College London, and the Hans Rausing Chair in the History of Science at Uppsala University, which is also hosting an annual Hans Rausing Lecture in the History of Science. The University of Cambridge Department of History and Philosophy of Science hosts an Annual Hans Rausing Lecture.

==Honours and UK tax status==
Hans Rausing received an honorary doctorate from Lund University. He was a visiting professor at Mälardalens Högskola, Sweden, and honorary professor at the University of Dubna, Russia. He was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 2006. He was an honorary fellow of the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, and in 2011 was made an honorary freeman and liveryman at the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers, London.
An article in the Guardian described how Hans Rausing had taken advantage of the UK&#x27;s &quot;remittance basis&quot; of taxation to reduce his UK tax exposure while UK resident. In 2002, for example, he earned income of around £225M but, according to the report, he incurred UK income tax on only £1M of it, because most of it arose outside the UK and therefore, because he did not &quot;remit&quot; it to the UK, the remittance basis meant he did not incur UK tax on it.

==Personal life==
Hans Rausing and his wife Märit Rausing had two daughters, Lisbet and Sigrid, and one son, Hans Kristian Rausing.

From 2001 to 2012, Rausing and his family donated £886,000 to the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party.

Rausing was a resident of the UK from 1982 until his death. He lived at The New House, Wadhurst Park, East Sussex, until his death on 30 August 2019.

<doc id="882431" wikidata="Q716710" url="?curid=882431" title="Chang Chun-hsiung">
<text>Chang Chun-hsiung (; born 23 March 1938) is a Taiwanese politician and lawyer who had served as the prime minister of Taiwan (officially Premier of the Executive Yuan) from 2000 to 2002 and 2007 to 2008, both under Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s presidency. His appointment by then-President Chen in 2000 marked the first time a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) member occupied the premiership.

As a founding member of the DPP, he served on its Central Committee and Central Standing Committee from 1986 to 2000.

==Early life and education==
Chang was born in 1938 in the city of Kagi (present-day Chiayi) when Taiwan (then Formosa) was still a colony of Japan. He earned his LL.B. at the National Taiwan University in 1960. Chang joined the Kuomintang in 1970, but was expelled three year later for mounting a campaign for the Taipei City Council. As a lawyer, he defended the victims of the Kaohsiung Incident in 1980. From 1982 to 1986 he was President of the Kaohsiung Chapter of the YMCA.

==Political career==
He was a member of the Legislative Yuan from 1983 to 2000. As a legislator, he was Executive Director and General Convener of the DPP Caucus from 1987 to 1988, 1990, and 1998 to 1999. He was Convener of the Judiciary Committee in 1991, of the Home and Border Affairs Committee in 92, and of the Transportation and Communications Committee in 95.

In 1994, Chang stood as the Democratic Progressive Party candidate to run for the mayor of Kaohsiung, but was defeated by the Kuomintang incumbent Wu Den-yih.

In the 2000 presidential election he was General Manager of Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s campaign. In the Chen administration, he served as Secretary-General of the Office of the President in 2000, Vice Premier of the ROC in 2000 and Premier of the Republic of China from October 6, 2000 to February 1, 2002.

Since 2002, he has been Secretary General of the Democratic Progressive Party and a Senior Adviser in the Office of the President.

He ran in the 2004 Legislative Yuan election as fourth on the DPP&#x27;s nationwide slate and was easily elected but resigned (as he promised to do during the campaign) since the Pan-Green Coalition failed to win a majority. He also tendered his resignation as Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party to take responsibility for the defeat.

Chang was appointed as the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation in 2005 after the death of the former chairman Koo Chen-fu. With the resignation of Su Tseng-chang as Premier on May 12, 2007, President Chen Shui-bian nominated Chang to fill the post of Premier a second time effective May 21, and Hung Chi-chang succeeded Chang as the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation. Su&#x27;s resignation and Chang&#x27;s second appointment as Premier marked the sixth premier that Chen Shui-bian has appointed during his two terms as President.

==Family life==
Chang maintained a long-term marriage-like relationship with a paramour while remaining legally married to his first wife, Hsu Jui-ying. After his first term as Premier, he and Hsu divorced, and in 2007 he married his paramour (Chu A-ying) as his second wife.

<doc id="882433" wikidata="Q1051055" url="?curid=882433" title="Theodore Long">
<text>Theodore Robert Rufus Long (born September 15, 1947) is an American former professional wrestling referee, manager and authority figure best known for his tenures in NWA, WCW and WWE.

Long began his career in the National Wrestling Alliance and made his WWE (then the World Wrestling Federation) debut in 1998 as a referee. He transitioned to be an on-screen manager in 2003 and later served as General Manager of SmackDown for two tenures lasting a combined six years as well as a one-year stint as ECW General Manager.

In 2017, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Ron Simmons and John Layfield.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1985–1996)===
Long started out as an errand boy for wrestlers Tommy Rich and Abdullah the Butcher. He eventually became a member of the ringcrew and was promoted to referee in the NWA&#x27;s Jim Crockett Promotions in 1985 as Teddy Long. In 1989, at the Chi-Town Rumble event, Long was the replacement referee when Ricky Steamboat won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

Shortly thereafter, Long began to turn into a villainous character when he started to bend the rules for heel wrestlers. On April 2, 1989, at &quot;Clash of the Champions VI&quot; in New Orleans, Long blatantly made a fast count allowing Mike Rotunda and &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams to defeat The Road Warriors for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. After this match, the National Wrestling Alliance relieved Long of his refereeing duties. This was actually a story lifted from Championship Wrestling from Florida, where Long had been a referee and did several heel-decisions in the ring, including one for Ron Simmons over Skip Young.

Long got his head shaved bald after losing a Hair vs Hair match to Paul Ellering at Capital Combat PPV.

While riding with Kevin Sullivan and Eddie Gilbert, Long would DJ for them. After hearing Long talk, the two convinced Jim Ross to give Long a managerial role, managing Norman the Lunatic. Long became the manager of Doom (Ron Simmons and Butch Reed) and led them to the World Tag Team Titles. He also managed Johnny B. Badd, One Man Gang, Norman the Lunatic, The Skyscrapers (Sid Vicious, Dan Spivey and &quot;Mean&quot; Mark Callous), Marcus Bagwell, 2 Cold Scorpio, Joey Maggs, Craig Pittman, Jim Powers, Bobby Walker, Ice Train and Bobby Eaton while in Jim Crockett Promotions and WCW.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE===

====Referee and manager (1998–2004)====
Long debuted in the WWF as a referee on the December 21, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw is War.&quot; Long went by the shortened Teddy Long name during this period. He was a referee at the Over The Edge 1999 PPV, during the match after Owen Hart&#x27;s tragic death: a mixed tag match between Jeff Jarrett/Debra and Val Venis/Nicole Bass. Long was the referee when Darren Drozdov ended up paralyzed and can be seen in WWE&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Try This At Home warning looking at the paramedics lift Droz up on a stretcher. He wrestled in a 3 on 2 handicap match with The Rock and Jack Doan defeating Kane and Rikishi on Monday Night Raw on January 8, 2001.

By late 2002, Vince McMahon wanted Long to become a heel manager like he was in NWA and WCW and decided to take Long off of television and the road for a while and by late summer 2003, He returned under his full name, and perhaps his most notable managing stint in this period came when managing D&#x27;Lo Brown, Rodney Mack, Christopher Nowinski, Rosey, Mark Henry and Jazz at different times, telling fans to &quot;Get down wit&#x27; da Brown&quot; and to &quot;Back da Mack&quot;. Long teamed with Mack and Nowiniski, losing to The Dudley Boyz at Insurrextion (2003). When he was drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he managed Mark Jindrak. On the January 5, 2004 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, he was filling in as the guest General Manager for Eric Bischoff. During a match between Mark Henry and Rob Van Dam, announcer Lilian Garcia had announced that Van Dam had won by DQ in a No Disqualification Match, but Long grabbed the microphone and ordered to restart the match. Just then, Stone Cold Steve Austin, as the &quot;Sheriff&quot;, came out with an ATV and chased him around the ring and the arena. After Van Dam won the match, Austin continued to chase Long until he was cornered by both him and Van Dam; in which they pushed Long back into the ring. As he begged Austin not to hurt him, Long offered him a handshake. He accepted it, only to give Long a stunner in the process for restarting the match.

====General manager of SmackDown and ECW (2004–2012)====
After Kurt Angle was fired from the general manager position in July 2004, Long became the new and first African-American general manager of SmackDown!. Long immediately turned face on his first night as general manager when he fined Angle $1,000 for not having his wrestling gear with him. Because of his face turn, his new position saw him giving the fans what they wanted and making matches that put heels at disadvantages, notably John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), a stark contrast to other WWE managers, such as Eric Bischoff and Mr. McMahon, who would blatantly favor heels. At first, he continued to use the &quot;Hater-ade&quot; catch phrase he started using as a bad guy, but less aggressively, and with more humor in it. Long would also introduce the &quot;New Talent Initiative&quot; during this time, which saw the likes of Bobby Lashley and Mr. Kennedy debut in 2005 and Montel Vontavious Porter in 2006, among others. The &quot;New Talent Initiative&quot; would continue, with a name-change to the &quot;New Superstar Initiative&quot;, when Long moved to ECW in 2008 and would see the debuts of Sheamus, Jack Swagger, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne, Tyler Reks, Trent Baretta, Caylen Croft, DJ Gabriel, Ricky Ortiz, Gavin Spears, Braden Walker and ECW referee Aaron Davis.

As part of the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; vs. &quot;Raw&quot; feud, Long defeated Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff at Survivor Series with the help of The Boogeyman.

Long had problems with Booker T and his defense of the United States Championship, however, as Booker T attempted to get out of title defenses on a number of occasions by pretending to be injured, and having other wrestlers fight on his behalf. Eventually, Long got tired of these shenanigans, and at No Way Out, Booker T was told to face Chris Benoit or be stripped of the title. Benoit won the match and was congratulated by Long.

After Randy Orton had cheated to obtain Rey Mysterio&#x27;s title shot at WrestleMania 22, Long placed Mysterio back in the match and made it a Triple Threat match, at the same time warning Orton that he could still remove Orton from the match if he disobeyed Long.

At Judgment Day Long fired Melina and Johnny Nitro from &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. On the following &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL suffered the same fate after losing the United States Championship to Bobby Lashley, and then losing a World Heavyweight Championship match to Rey Mysterio in his Judgment Day rematch.

On the September 4, 2006 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Long appeared to a tremendous ovation in his hometown of Atlanta. During a six-person, intergender tag match between Randy Orton, Edge, and Lita against Trish Stratus, Carlito, and John Cena, some fans chanted Theodore&#x27;s name.

In April 2007, Long became the on-screen boyfriend of Kristal Marshall, after weeks flirting with each other backstage. Long then began to look for an assistant so he could spend more time with Kristal, eventually revealing Vickie Guerrero as his new assistant on May 25, 2007, an appointment made partly at Kristal&#x27;s request. At he appeared after Edge lost a Last Chance match against Batista via disqualification as a result of a low blow and reset the match, with the disqualification and countout rule waived. On the June 22, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Long asked Kristal to marry him. Kristal ran out of the ring, crying, but later agreed to marry him. On the July 27, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Ron Simmons was named the best man for &quot;Theodore Rufus Long&quot; and Kristal&#x27;s wedding on the September 21, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; emanating from Long&#x27;s hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. The wedding was not completed, however, due to constant disruptions and Long having a heart attack just as he started to say &quot;I do&quot;. He then fell into a coma. The storyline never finished out as planned as Marshall left the WWE shortly afterwards due to creative differences. Long returned on the November 30, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as the assistant general manager and made a match at Armageddon for the World Heavyweight Championship. He started to feud with Guerrero over her position as the general manager as she continued to favor Edge. On the May 16, 2008 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long quit his role of assistant general manager.
On the June 3, 2008 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, it was announced that Long had become the new general manager of the ECW brand by order of the WWE board of directors.

On the April 7, 2009 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Long announced he was returning to SmackDown as general manager, with Tiffany replacing him on &quot;ECW&quot;. By doing this, he became the first person in the history of the company to have a second term as general manager. He made his official return to &quot;SmackDown&quot; on April 10, when he announced that the Hardys (Matt and Jeff) would face each other in the first-ever stretcher match in &quot;SmackDown&quot; history.

At the Breaking Point PPV, Long restarted the World Heavyweight Championship match between CM Punk and The Undertaker after Undertaker made Punk submit using his &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot; submission finisher, stating that the ban on the maneuver was still in effect. On the September 18, 2009 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, WWE chairman Mr. McMahon instructed Long to go down to the ring and explain his actions regarding the conclusion of the World Heavyweight Championship Submission match between champion CM Punk and The Undertaker in which Long, as well as referee Scott Armstrong and CM Punk played key roles in recreating the infamous Montreal Screwjob at Breaking Point (held at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, site of the 1997 fiasco), this time, with The Undertaker being the target of a planned conspiracy. As he returned from the ring to the back stage area, he entered his waiting limousine only to be kidnapped by The Undertaker, who was in the driver&#x27;s seat. The following week on &quot;SmackDown&quot; Long was brought into the arena inside a coffin by Undertaker&#x27;s druids where he again legalized Undertaker&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Gate submission hold. Long made a guest appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; and later Shawn Michaels performed his finishing maneuver Sweet Chin Music on Long after Long refused to draft Michaels to SmackDown. He then began a feud with Drew McIntyre, the first part of which revolved around McIntyre qualifying for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXVI, which was instead won by Jack Swagger. On the May 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after McIntyre brutally assaulted Matt Hardy, Long stripped McIntyre of his Intercontinental Championship and fired him. As a result, the Intercontinental Championship was vacant. Thus, Long issued the Intercontinental Championship tournament involving Christian, Kofi Kingston, Cody Rhodes and Dolph Ziggler. However, after Kingston emerged victorious against Christian, Long was issued a letter from Vince McMahon reinstating McIntyre and forcing Kingston to give his title back to McIntyre. He then made a match for McIntyre&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship at Over the Limit against Kofi Kingston.

On the May 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long read a letter from Mr. McMahon&#x27;s office given to him by Drew McIntyre which stated that Matt Hardy was suspended until further notice after Hardy attacked McIntyre at Over the Limit and told Hardy not to go near McIntyre and if he did so, Long would be fired as the general manager of SmackDown.

On the June 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, a frustrated McIntyre announced a match between Long and McIntyre would take place the following week on &quot;SmackDown&quot; per orders of McMahon. McIntyre said if Long didn&#x27;t compete, he would be fired. McIntyre then went on to win the match the following week, after it was ordered that Long had get down on his knees, proclaim Drew as &quot;The Chosen One&quot; and then lay on his back and let McIntyre pin him without a fight. On the June 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long reinstated Hardy and made McIntyre compete against the returning Hardy. Hardy would win the match, but after the match, Long came out and told McIntyre that his work visa had expired, and made security carry him out of the arena. On the July 9 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, McIntyre was reinstated and pleaded forgiveness from Long, even going so far as to nominate Long as a member of the WWE Hall of Fame as well as get on his knees and proclaim Long &quot;the best boss he ever had.&quot; Long, however, did not believe him and announced a Money in the Bank qualifying match (for the upcoming Money in the Bank pay-per-view) against Kofi Kingston.

On the January 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long was found (kayfabe) unconscious in his office, suffering a head injury. He returned on the February 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, where he revealed Vickie Guerrero and Dolph Ziggler to have attacked him. He then scheduled a match between the new World Heavyweight Champion Ziggler and Edge. Edge would win the match, becoming an eleven-time world champion. After the match, Long would then fire Ziggler. The following week, he fired Guerrero after she lost a mixed tag team match.

On the May 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long scheduled a World Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Orton and Christian who had just won it for the first time five nights previous at Extreme Rules. On the June 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian was chosen by Long as the special guest referee for a World Heavyweight Championship match between Orton and Sheamus who beat Christian and Mark Henry in a triple threat number one contender&#x27;s match for the title the week before. Christian would turn heel by hitting Orton with the title he had retained and lost to Orton again at Capitol Punishment despite his foot being under the bottom rope. Christian blamed Long and as a result Long scheduled Orton to defend his title against Christian at Money in the Bank. Christian would manage to find a way to include a clause that if Orton were to get disqualified, the title would switch hands.

On the July 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; the new COO Triple H made Zack Ryder Theodore Long&#x27;s new Assistant.

On the November 25, 2011 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after Daniel Bryan seemingly successfully cashed in the SmackDown Money in the Bank briefcase on Mark Henry to win his first World Heavyweight Championship, Long rushed down to the ring and declared the title change void, as Mark Henry had not yet been medically cleared to compete in an official match. He would schedule Bryan in a fatal four-way match against Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Wade Barrett to determine the number one contender for Henry&#x27;s title which would be defended on the November 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; in a steel cage match.

After , Santino Marella replaced Zack Ryder (who had just won his first United States Championship) as the assistant SmackDown general manager.

====Feud with John Laurinaitis and Eve Torres and becoming senior adviser (2012–2014)====
On February 21, 2012, Long was criticized by Interim Raw General Manager John Laurinaitis, which prompted the WWE board of directors to switch the general managers of their respective shows for one week. Long took charge of the March 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, with Laurinaitis taking charge of the March 9 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; During Laurinaitis&#x27; time in charge of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, he set up a match between himself and Long, where, if Long lost, Aksana, Long&#x27;s girlfriend, would be placed in a match with Kane. Long won the match when Randy Orton attacked Kane at ringside, which distracted Laurinaitis. The Aksana-Kane match never took place.

A 12-man Tag Team match was then set up at WrestleMania XXVIII, where six superstars would represent both general managers. Long chose Santino Marella as his team captain, along with Kofi Kingston, R-Truth, Zack Ryder, The Great Khali and Booker T over the following weeks. A stipulation was added that the winning team at WrestleMania would determine who would become the general manager of both shows. At WrestleMania, Team Teddy lost to Team Johnny, ending Long&#x27;s run as SmackDown General Manager.

On the April 6 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long prepared to give his farewell speech, but Laurinaitis threatened to discontinue a trust fund Long had set up for his grandchildren&#x27;s college education unless he took a job as his new assistant, to which Long reluctantly accepted.

Laurinaitis hired the evil Eve Torres to be his Executive Administrator, and informed Long that he would now be working under Eve and would report to her. As Eve&#x27;s subordinate, the next few weeks were hell for Long. Eve found the role to be a power trip and enjoyed abusing her position by bullying and humiliating Teddy on numerous occasions. She took great pleasure in humiliating him by forcing him to do menial, degrading tasks; such as making him wear an apron and name tag at all times, like a maid. As well as stand guard by a door dressed as a Queen&#x27;s soldier. She also enjoyed ordering him to get her coffee, and would throw the coffee all over him if it wasn&#x27;t to her satisfaction. Long was also forced by Eve to rub oil on Antonio Cesaro for a photoshoot, this was particularly humiliating for Teddy as it was in front of his ex love interest (and Cesaro&#x27;s girlfriend) Aksana, who seemed to find Long&#x27;s predicament extremely entertaining.

At Extreme Rules, he was criticized for spinning a wheel to determine what match Cody Rhodes and Big Show would face off in by making it a tables match. At Over the Limit he mocked David Otunga and Eve Torres ahead of Laurinaitis&#x27; bout with John Cena which if he lost he would be fired. This further angered Laurinaitis who defeated Cena to keep his job with help from Big Show. At No Way Out, Laurinaitis was fired and Long enjoyed watching him being attacked by John Cena the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;.

After Laurinaitis&#x27; firing as general manager, Long served as guest general manager for both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; on July 2 and July 3 respectively. On the August 3 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long was made the senior advisor to new SmackDown General Manager Booker T. Despite originally getting along with Booker very well, beginning in March 2013, Booker began to get angry at Long for booking matches without his permission on both Raw and SmackDown. However, from mid April onwards, Long began running &quot;SmackDown&quot; again temporarily with Booker T away due to surgery. On the July 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after the returning Booker T and Raw General Manager Brad Maddox had an argument on who was to be SmackDown General Manager, Mr. McMahon came out to say Vickie Guerrero was named SmackDown&#x27;s new general manager. After a backstage segment, with Guerrero, Long was escorted out by a security team. This marked his last appearance as a major authoritative figure.

On June 12, 2014, after nearly a year of inactivity, Long was released from WWE along with ten other contracts, ending his long tenure with the company.

====Hall of Fame and sporadic appearances (2014–present)====
On October 10 for the 15th Anniversary of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Long made a surprise appearance; getting into an argument with John Laurinaitis. This led to a 16-man Tag Team match, in which Team Teddy (Sheamus, Mark Henry, Jack Swagger, The Usos, Los Matadores and El Torito) defeated Team Johnny (Cesaro, Gold and Stardust, Bo Dallas, Damien Mizdow, Heath Slater, Titus O&#x27;Neil and Hornswoggle).

After the announcement of the restored WWE brand extension, on the June 6, 2016 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Long returned in the opening segment between the Money in the Bank participants, requesting another run as general manager of SmackDown, only to be turned away by Stephanie McMahon. He would make several other appearances throughout the course of the night including his attempt of making a tag team match between The Golden Truth (Goldust and R-Truth) and Breezango (Tyler Breeze and Fandango) before being escorted out of the building by security.

On February 13, 2017, it was announced that he would be inducted in the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame. On the April 3, 2017 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Long made an appearance, thinking that Mr. McMahon would appoint him to be the new general manager of Raw, but McMahon said that it was not him; instead, Vince chose Kurt Angle, another 2017 WWE Hall of Fame inductee, as general manager. On January 22, 2018, Long made a brief backstage appearance during Raw 25 Years.

Long also made an appearance on the January 4, 2021 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; under the &quot;Raw Legends Night&quot; special wherein he announced that he booked The Miz and John Morrison in a tag-team match against The New Day, in which the latter won, He also appeared on the special throwback episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on May 7, 2021.

On January 23, 2023, Long appeared on Raw is XXX, celebrating the 30th anniversary of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, where he booked a six-man tag match between Seth Rollins with The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) and Imperium (Gunther, Ludwig Kaiser and Giovanni Vinci), after Imperium disrespected D-Generation X.

On April 26, 2024, Long was seen as part of SmackDown backstage team during the 2024 WWE Draft.

===Independent circuit (2014–present)===
In 2014, Booker T had announced that Long would serve as the general manager for his Reality of Wrestling promotion&#x27;s Summer of Champions iPPV.

Teddy Long acted as the general manager for &quot;SWE Fury&quot;, a nationally televised wrestling promotion based in Plano, Texas. Long left the company in August 2021.

From 2021 to present, Long has worked as commissioner for Alabama Independent promotions Main Event Wrestling and Independent Wrestling Network.

== Filmography ==

=== Web series ===
== Personal life ==
Long was married to his wife Tasha Long for forty years. They remained married until her death in September 2022.

==Match innovations==
While portraying the role of the &quot;SmackDown&quot; general manager, Long revived many old and made new match types:

*At No Mercy 2004, he put JBL and The Undertaker in a Last Ride Match. The rules were similar to a Casket Match and an Ambulance Match where one opponent must put the other into the back of the hearse and drive out the arena. JBL won the first Last Ride Match due to interference by Heidenreich. At Armageddon 2006, The Undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in the second Last Ride Match. 
*At No Way Out 2005, JBL had to defend his title against Big Show in the first-ever Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match. The rules were the same as a normal steel cage match, but the top of the cage had barbed wire around it so nobody could escape (despite the fact that a victory could still be declared if a competitor managed to escape). This was done by Long to make sure there was no interference from any superstars, primarily JBL&#x27;s stable, The Cabinet. JBL won the match when Big Show chokeslammed him through the ring, allowing him to escape underneath.
*Long also brought back the King of the Ring tournament in 2006 as a &quot;SmackDown&quot;-exclusive event.
*At Armageddon 2006, Long brought back the Inferno match, where Kane defeated MVP.
*On the April 10, 2009 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; he announced that Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy would face each other in the first stretcher match in &quot;SmackDown&quot; history.

==Catchphrases==
Long is well known for his various catchphrases while portraying an authority figure, most notably telling villainous wrestlers to go “one on one with The Undertaker!”, his trademark “Holla, holla, holla!”, his peacemaking “(Now) hold on just a minute playa!” and his kayfabe obsession for placing wrestlers in a “tag team match!”.

<doc id="882438" wikidata="Q335041" url="?curid=882438" title="Murphy's War">
<text>Murphy&#x27;s War is an Eastmancolor 1971 Panavision war film starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and Siân Phillips. It was directed by Peter Yates, based on the 1969 novel by Max Catto. The film&#x27;s cinematographer was Douglas Slocombe.

The film is set in Venezuela during World War II and focuses on a stubborn survivor of a sunken merchant ship who is consumed in his quest for revenge and retribution against the Nazi German submarine that sank his ship and slaughtered the survivors.
==Plot==
In the closing days of World War II, Irish crewman Murphy is the sole survivor of the crew of merchant ship &quot;Mount Kyle&quot;, which had been sunk by a Nazi German U-boat and the survivors machine-gunned in the water. Murphy reaches the shore and finds a missionary settlement on the Orinoco in Venezuela, where he is treated by the pacifist Quaker Dr. Hayden.

When Murphy discovers that the U-boat is hiding farther up river under the cover of the jungle, he obsessively plots to sink it by any means, including by using a surviving Grumman J2F Duck floatplane from the &quot;Mount Kyle&quot;. The floatplane&#x27;s wounded pilot was shot dead in his hospital bed by the U-boat captain, compounding the earlier war crime of shooting the survivors in the water, in order to preserve the secret of the submarine&#x27;s location. Murphy tries to fly the aircraft on the choppy river water and learns how to manipulate the controls by trial and error. He soon finds the U-boat&#x27;s hiding place and attempts to bomb it using homemade Molotov cocktail bombs, but his effort fails and the mission settlement is destroyed in retaliation.

Word comes that Germany has surrendered, but Murphy is obsessed with revenge and plans to ram the U-boat with a floating crane owned by Louis, a friendly Frenchman. This attempt also fails when the U-boat dives under him. However, the submerged U-boat is ensnared in a mud bank. Murphy uses the crane to recover an unexploded torpedo fired earlier by the U-boat and drops it on the trapped crew, killing them. Murphy is also killed as the explosion from the torpedo causes the crane jib to pin him to the deck as the floating crane sinks to the river bed.

==Cast==
* Peter O&#x27;Toole as Murphy 
* Siân Phillips as Dr. Hayden 
* Philippe Noiret as Louis Brezon 
* Horst Janson as Commander Lauchs, German Submarine Captain 
* John Hallam as Lieutenant Ellis, Seaplane Pilot from RNMS &quot;Mount Kyle&quot; 
* Ingo Mogendorf as Lieutenant Voght, Submarine Executive Officer
* Harry Fielder as German Sub Crewman
* George Roubicek as U-boat Crewman

==Differences between film and book==

* Murphy is one of his ship&#x27;s officers in the novel, but his film counterpart is a mechanic for the seaplane.
* The character of Lieutenant Ellis is not featured in the novel.
* Dr. Hayden is a composite of several doctors from the novel.
* Louis is a self-loathing deserter from the French military in the book but a jovial company man in the film.
* The submarine crew is portrayed more sympathetically in the novel. Most of them are war-weary and apolitical, save for Lieutenant Voght, who seizes command and murders Murphy&#x27;s crew while the captain is incapacitated by a head wound.
* The book&#x27;s end is quite different to that of the film. In the book, when Murphy drops the torpedo, it splits the sub in half and inadvertently allows most of the trapped crewmen to swim to the surface and survive. An injured Vought cannot reach shore and is carried away by the current to his death. Murphy also avoids death during the crane operation. Murphy and Captain Lauchs briefly fight each other on the beach before sinking to the ground in exhaustion.

===Development===
Film rights to the novel were purchased by Paramount Pictures. In 1969, Frank Sinatra was recruited to star in the film, but he withdrew from the project. Eventually Robert Evans, head of Paramount, offered the project to the team of Peter Yates and Michael Deeley, who had made &quot;Robbery&quot; for the studio. Deeley says a script had already been written by Stirling Silliphant, who worked on subsequent drafts with Yates. Silliphant later recalled:
Our purpose was to make a flat-out statement about the absurdity, the meaninglessness, of war. So we went for minimal sound, minimal dialogue, a kind of intense fumbling toward death, toward the showdown between enemies who have no further reason for enmity except the blind stupidity and vengefulness of the Peter O’Toole character. And this is why, at the end, in a high angle shot director Peter Yates closed out the film with the sub sinking, the barge sinking, and the river surging above both, covering them for all eternity. Over this he shot a ragged flight of jungle birds, wheeling off, the only survivors of this pointless encounter between men and their machines. 
Yates said that he was particularly interested in &quot;the way in which three people—Murphy, a doctor and a Frenchman left in the backwash of war—are really brought together by circumstance and how each character plays on the other and makes them do things that they wish they hadn&#x27;t and things they sometimes feel proud of.&quot;

Deeley has said that Paramount became less enthusiastic about the project as time passed. Since he and Yates had a pay-or-play contract, Evans offered them the chance to make &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) but Yates turned it down in order to make &quot;Murphy&#x27;s War&quot;. Eventually Paramount agreed to provide half of film&#x27;s financing in exchange for world-distribution rights. The other half of the budget came from London Screenplays, a finance company from Dimitri de Grunwald.

The lead role was given to Peter O&#x27;Toole for a fee of $250,000. A number of other stars had turned it down including Warren Beatty, Robert Redford and Lee Marvin. His female co-star was his real-life wife Siân Phillips. The couple had appeared together in the 1964 film &quot;Becket&quot; and the 1969 musical film &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;. O&#x27;Toole wanted to play an Irishman so the script was rewritten accordingly.

===Production===
Filming began on 23 February 1970 and was completed with location shooting in Malta on 5 July. Filming occurred at locations in the regions of Puerto Ordaz and Castillos de Guayana on the Orinoco River in Venezuela, and on set at Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath and Twickenham Film Studios, Middlesex, England. Deeley described the shoot as the toughest of his career, which led to the breakup of his partnership with Yates, with whom he had made several films.

For the scenes filmed in Malta that depict the burning of the merchant ship, O&#x27;Toole swam through water afire with oil and with explosives detonating all around him. He later said: &quot;I used to do all my own stunts when I first started. I made it a principle. Everything in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; I did myself. But after suffering a paralyzed hand, a bad back, broken ankle and countless knocks, I decided never again. It was stupid. Films employ stunt men (for a reason!). They can do these things far better than I. I refused to do any more stunts. [Then] I thought, well, just one more time. So I talked myself into it. In Venezuela I even fly a seaplane. If you want to see a picture of sheer terror have a look at the shots of me when I first fly that seaplane.&quot;

Deeley viewed the film as an action adventure, and says he wanted O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s character to live at the end of the film but Yates insisted he die and to make the film more of an anti-war statement.

Several of the sequences were photographed by cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, including the scenes with Murphy piloting the floatplane and the visuals along the Orinoco River. Especially notable is an airborne shot of a flock of scarlet ibises in flight along the shore of the river during the closing credits. For the extensive flying scene with many shots of the floatplane stalling and veering sharply to avoid obstacles, a camera was strapped to the wing of the aircraft.

Several Peace Corps volunteers serving in towns near the Orinoco River were recruited to play Nazi submariners. The volunteers donated their daily wages to the Venezuelan school districts or other organizations with which they were working. 
The Type IX U-boat was represented by the Venezuelan Navy&#x27;s ARV &quot;Carite&quot; (S-11); this was the former , which had been sold to Venezuela in 1960 (the submarine is far taller than a wartime U-boat, and its single gun position behind the conning tower makes it look like a Type VII U-boat). The floating crane was a former World War II tank landing craft. The OA-12 Duck used in the film was restored and flown by Frank Tallman and is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. In the original book, the aircraft was a Fairey Swordfish.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere on 13 January 1971 at the Odeon Leicester Square.

==Reception==
&quot;Murphy&#x27;s War&quot; was not successful among critics or at the box office. Deeley later wrote &quot;From the vantage of today the film looks dated: nothing more than a string of cliched scenes, centring on a cliched character. The aerial photography still looks good, at least. But at the time my chief emotion was, &#x27;Finally, it&#x27;s over…&#x27;.&quot;

Roger Greenspun&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; centered on the awkwardness of the plot: &quot;The sense of a film in which nothing quite works with anything else pervades &#x27;Murphy&#x27;s War,&#x27; and it extends from such crucial technical details as the sloppy and finally tedious cross-cutting… to the playing together of the principal actors.&quot;

A review in &quot;Variety&quot; stated: &quot;By no means a film classic, &#x27;Murphy&#x27;s War&#x27; stands out as the kind of good, solid entertainment needed these days to fill houses.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the film two stars out of four and called it &quot;an adventure story high in production values but low in suspense.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The story proceeds from the detestable to the improbable by way of the uninteresting. Rarely will you see a major motion picture so flat and devoid of tone or atmosphere.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a dim, self-defeating adventure movie&quot; with a screenplay &quot;at peculiar cross-purposes with itself…&quot;

A review in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; praised O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s performance but called the film a &quot;sluggish action spectacle.&quot;

<text>A softmod (short for software modification) is a method of using software to modify the intended behavior of hardware, such as computer hardware, or video game consoles in a way that can overcome restrictions of the firmware, or install custom firmware.

==Function==
Many softmods are exploits chained together. The first requirement is executing unsigned code, known as userland exploits. Internet Browsers are very common vectors for this, as WebKit is open-source and as a result, vulnerabilities are widely known. The second requirement is privilege escalation, known as kernel exploits, unlocking secure parts of the system. Depending on the security architecture, additional privilege escalation may be required, such as defeating a hypervisor.

Other examples of softmods are maliciously signed firmware, such as custom firmware on the PlayStation 3, which was made possible due to the master key being released, or gaining control of a process that is very early in the boot cycle, such as the Fusée Gelée Boot ROM vulnerability for the Nintendo Switch. This allowed for arbitrary code execution and also gaining control of every process on the system after it.

Softmods may be permanent (e.g. custom firmware) or temporary (e.g. homebrew enabler) that persist until reboot. Softmods are especially popular among video game consoles, in which they usually enable a homebrew environment that allow execution of unsigned code. Compared to installing a modchip, a softmod is usually preferred (if available) due to not requiring having to open up the device and perform soldering, which could damage the device hardware. However, attempting to softmod can still cause damage to the device especially if instructions are not followed correctly, potentially leading to bricking.

Softmods may be used to install an alternative operating system (e.g. a Linux distribution) on a device, as well as reinstate functionality that was removed from the official firmware, such as &quot;OtherOS&quot; on the PlayStation 3.

Softmods void warranty due to tampering with device function and as a result, vendors will not honour any existing warranty policy if sent in for repair.

==Legality==
Due to commonly being used to circumvent digital rights management, softmodding is seen as a tool to enable piracy, although the act of softmodding in itself may not be illegal.

In January 2011, security researcher Geohot and associates of the hacking group known as &quot;fail0verflow&quot; were sued by Sony for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3. Sony and Geohot later settled the case out of court, with Geohot agreeing not to reverse engineer any Sony product in the future.

In Japan, softmods were outlawed as part of new legislation in 2018 which made savegame editing and console modding illegal.

==Softmods for video game consoles==
===PlayStation/PSOne===
The original PlayStation can be softmodded with the TonyHax exploit. The exploit is compatible with all North American and European consoles except the launch model (SCPH-100x), but is not compatible with Japanese consoles. It is also compatible with early versions of the PlayStation 2 (SCPH-3900x or older), although only for booting PS1 discs. TonyHax can be booted either with a gamesave exploit (usually Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2, 3, or 4, hence the name, but several other games are also supported), or except on the PS2, directly from a specially-flashed memory card. The exploit allows the console to boot homebrew, foreign-region games, and CD-R copies. Some PlayStation models are partially incompatible (slow load times, skipping audio and video) with phthalocyanine CD-Rs, preferring the older standard cyanine discs. TonyHax is not a permanent exploit; the drive is re-locked when the console is powered off or rebooted, requiring the user to re-load the exploit every time a CD-R or foreign game is booted.

An older method was to boot an original legitimate disc with the lid close sense button held down, quickly swap the disc with a CD-R copy or foreign disc, remove that disc and reinsert the original, and then swap for the CD-R or foreign disc again. This had to be carefully timed, and if done incorrectly could damage the drive or disc(s).

===PlayStation 2===
The PlayStation 2 has various methods of achieving a softmod.

Disc swapping was used early on to bypass the PlayStation 2 copy protection, by taking advantage of certain trigger discs such as &quot;007: Agent Under Fire&quot; or Swap Magic, homebrew could be loaded. This was done by inserting the trigger disc, blocking the lid open sensor then hotswapping with a homebrew disc. Although difficult to execute correctly, the universality of the method was often used in order to softmod.

One of the earliest softmods developed — the Independence Exploit — allows the PlayStation 2 to run homebrew by exploiting a buffer overflow in the BIOS code responsible for loading original PlayStation games. This method, however, only works on models V10 and lower, excluding the PlayStation 2 slim, while still requiring a disc to be burned.

FreeMcBoot is an exploit that works on all models except the SCPH-9000x series with BIOS v2.30 and up. It requires no trigger disc and is able to directly load ELFs from the memory card.

Fortuna, Funtuna, and Opentuna are another form of memory card exploit. Unlike FreeMcBoot, they will work on the SCPH-9000x model, and they are compatible with third-party memory cards that do not support MagicGate.

HD Loader is an exploit for PS2 models with the hard drive peripheral.

FreeDVDBoot is an exploit discovered in 2020 that requires burning a disc image loaded with a payload onto a DVD-R. It is compatible with a range of PlayStation 2 models and works by exploiting a buffer overflow in the PS2&#x27;s DVD video functionality.

MechaPwn is an exploit that permanently unlocks the DVD drive of the slim PS2 (and some later revisions of the fat PS2), allowing PS1 and PS2 discs from any region to be booted. PS1 CD-R copies can be booted directly from the PS2&#x27;s built-in menu; PS2 CD-R/DVD-R copies require additional software to bypass the PlayStation 2 logo check.

In August 2024, a savegame exploit affecting multiple consoles and generations called &quot;TonyHawksProStrcpy&quot; was released, which is present in multiple Tony Hawk&#x27;s titles for the PlayStation 2. It can be used to execute unsigned code.

===PlayStation 3===
The PlayStation 3 has a couple of methods to achieve a softmod. All models of PS3 can be softmodded.

Consoles that have factory installed (minimum firmware) version 3.55 or lower can install CFW (custom firmware) which is unofficial firmware. This includes: all fat models, slim 20xx and 21xx models, and 25xx models - the latter only if the console was manufactured before December 2010 (date code 0D or less). These guidelines assume a console has not been taken to Sony to be serviced, as Sony may update the factory installed firmware. Slim 30xx and all super slim models cannot currently install CFW. 

Installing CFW was made possible with code signing after the PS3&#x27;s master key was leaked. Sony changed the key with firmware 3.56. If a vulnerable console has official firmware above 3.55 installed, the flash can be patched via a WebKit exploit which enables a CFW install. Should the patching process be interrupted (e.g. power outage), it can brick the console.

CFW grants complete control over the console, having access to LV0 (bootloader), LV1 (hypervisor), and LV2 (kernel/GameOS). This allows the running of homebrew, load game backups, bypass region checks, enter Factory Service Mode, change fan and RSX (GPU) speeds, overclock the RSX, grant access to root keys, as well as run PS2 ISOs on unsupported backwards compatible models (via software emulation). Some CFW implementations reinstate features Sony removed such as &quot;OtherOS&quot;.

The most supported PS3 CFW is &quot;Evilnat Cobra&quot;. 

The other softmod is &quot;PS3HEN&quot; (HEN). HEN is supported by all PS3 models. In order to use HEN, it is required to install HFW (hybrid firmware), another kind of unofficial firmware. During the HEN setup process, a WebKit exploit is used to install a signed file through the PS3 Web Browser which sets up HEN on the PS3&#x27;s storage. This adds a shortcut to enable HEN whenever the console is powered on, which leverages additional exploits to grant LV2 kernel/GameOS access. As such, this is a tether softmod, meaning HEN has to be activated every time the console is powered on. This softmod shares core CFW features - running homebrew, load backups of games, bypass region checks, change fan speeds, and play installed PS2 Classics PKGs. The unofficial PS2 backwards compatibility is diminished as users can only run PS2 Classics encrypted PKGs instead of ISOs.

With HEN, the hypervisor is still active and periodically checks if the current code being executed is unsigned; there is a small chance it can lead to the console becoming unresponsive or shutting down, making HEN less stable than CFW.

===PlayStation 4===
The PlayStation 4 has ways to achieve a softmod. Most rely on WebKit vulnerabilities in the PS4 Web Browser combined with a kernel exploit. All models of PS4 can be softmodded. They are all tether exploits meaning they have to be performed every time the console is powered on, although some exploits may be persisted using rest mode.

Softmodding a PS4 allows users to run homebrew, load game backups, bypass region checks, and change fan and CPU/GPU speeds. Some payloads can boot the PS4 into a Linux distribution, although this is not permanent and the console will revert to Orbis OS on reboot.

Notable firmware revisions that result in a softmod are: 1.76, 4.05, 4.74, 5.05/5.07, 6.72, 7.02, 7.55, 9.00, 11.00, with 5.05/5.07 being the most stable and 9.00 the most stable after that. It is worth noting the 9.00 exploit requires inserting a specially crafted USB flash drive into the console, and the 11.00 exploit to connect to a malicious PPPoE server over the network.

===PlayStation 5===
The PlayStation 5 has ways to achieve a softmod. They rely on a userland exploit, which can be either WebKit vulnerabilities in the PS5 Web Browser, a specially crafted Blu-ray disc, or a savegame exploit, that is combined with a kernel (and optionally hypervisor) exploit. They are all tether exploits meaning they have to be performed every time the console is powered on, although some exploits may be persisted using rest mode.

Softmodding a PS5 allows running homebrew, load game backups, modify the PS4 backwards compatibility blacklist, install and run PS4 &quot;FPKGs&quot; (including PS4 homebrew and PS1/PS2/PS4 game backups), change fan speeds, and spoof firmware (which allows the install of games that require an update patch, and can also block updates). However, firmware spoofing will not allow games above the console&#x27;s true firmware revision to load without the required update patch. The PS5 is also capable of playing patched PS4 titles above the PS4 frame rate cap of 60 FPS, such as Bloodborne, at higher frame rates e.g. 120 FPS.

Compared to its predecessor the PS4, a userland and kernel exploit would have been enough to accomplish what is generally regarded as a true jailbreak by patching the kernel, however the PS5 has added security measures in comparison, mainly a hypervisor (HV) and eXecute Only Memory (XOM) which do not allow kernel patching - as a result not all kernel exploits on the PS5 can be leveraged due to these additional measures, and makes reverse engineering much more difficult. Despite this, several HENs (Homebrew ENablers) have been made that operate within the constraints of the HV and XOM to defeat enough security to enable a homebrew environment. After the first public HV exploit, HENs were adjusted to operate with the HV compromised (including the XOM being deactivated), providing better stability and functionality than HENs that don&#x27;t leverage a HV exploit since kernel patching is now possible.

Firmware up to 2.50 is vulnerable to a userland, kernel, and hypervisor exploit chain. Firmware up to 7.61 is vulnerable to a userland and kernel exploit chain.

The IPv6 kernel exploit on the PS4 that led to the 6.72 jailbreak was patched a few months prior to the release of the PS5, which was reintroduced on the PS5 with 3.00 firmware and affected up to 4.51 firmware. The exFAT filesystem kernel exploit that led to the 9.00 jailbreak also affected PS5 firmware up to 4.03, however due to additional protections on the PS5 it is not possible to use this to softmod the PS5. The PPPoE kernel exploit that led to the PS4 11.00 jailbreak also affected PS5 firmware up to 8.20, and is not known to softmod the PS5.

In June 2023, a payload called &quot;libhijacker&quot; was disclosed, becoming a reliable method of running homebrew and partially circumvents the HV, which works by creating a new, separate process by interacting with the PS5&#x27;s Daemon, effectively acting as a background ELF loader. This is notable over previous ELF loaders such as the WebKit or Blu-ray methods since those ELF loaders were terminated when the corresponding process was stopped. Another advantage of this new method is that the newly separate process is not confined to the fixed maximum resource allocation of the WebKit or BD-J processes.

In July 2023, security researcher &quot;Flat_z&quot; disclosed that they had read access to the PS5&#x27;s Platform Secure Processor (PSP) which is one of the most protected parts of the system and contains crucial keys for decryption. In addition, they also confirmed they had successfully exploited the HV via a save game exploit chain. &quot;Flat_z&quot; said he does not intend to disclose his findings publicly, however he is using these exploits to further reverse engineer the PS5 now that he is able to decrypt more parts of the system.

In November 2023, scene developer &quot;LightningMods&quot; disclosed that they had managed to load and play a retail PS5 game backup.

In December 2023, scene developer &quot;LightningMods&quot; updated his &quot;Itemzflow&quot; homebrew to support loading PS5 game backups.

In September 2024, a kernel exploit was disclosed for FreeBSD 11, which the PS5 software is based on. It can be leveraged on the PS5, which affects all firmware versions up to 7.61. The bug is not present in FreeBSD 9 and as such the PS4 is unaffected.

In October 2024, security researcher &quot;SpecterDev&quot; disclosed two exploit chains that compromise the hypervisor, which affect all firmware versions up to 2.50.

===PlayStation Portable===
Much like the Xbox, it is possible to softmod almost any PSP. Using various exploits (such as the TIFF exploit or specially crafted savegames from games such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot;, &quot;Lumines&quot;, and later &quot;GripShift&quot;) or original unprotected firmware, the user can run a modified version of the PSPs updater, that will install custom firmware. This newer firmware allows the booting of ISOs, as well as running unauthorized (homebrew) code. A popular way of running homebrew code to softmod the PSP is by using the Infinity method.

===PlayStation Vita===

The PlayStation Vita can also be softmodded, with the most notorious methods being using: HENkaku Web Exploit, h-encore and h-encore².

===Xbox===
Xbox used to include a font exploit installed through exploits in savegame code for &quot;MechAssault&quot;, &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, &quot;007: Agent Under Fire&quot;, and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;. Usage of the &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; or &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; disc is generally recommended as any version of the game will run the exploit, whereas certain production runs of Mechassault and &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; are needed to use the exploit. Originally, via a piece of software called &quot;MechInstaller&quot; created by members of the Xbox-linux team, an additional option could be added to the Xbox Dashboard for booting Linux.

The font hack works by exploiting a buffer underflow in the Xbox font loader which is part of the dashboard. Unfortunately, since the Xbox requires the clock to be valid, and the dashboard itself is where one sets the clock, there is a problem if the RTC backup capacitor discharges. The Xbox will detect that the clock is not set and therefore force the dashboard to be loaded; the dashboard then reboots due to the buffer overflow exploit. Upon restarting, the Xbox detects the clock is invalid and the process repeats. This problem became known as the &quot;clockloop&quot;.

In August 2024, a savegame exploit affecting multiple consoles and generations called &quot;TonyHawksProStrcpy&quot; was released, which is present in multiple Tony Hawk&#x27;s titles for the Xbox. It can be used to execute unsigned code.

===Xbox 360===
Shortly after the release of the Xbox 360, ways were found to modify the firmware of the DVD drive of the console. This allows the system to play games from &quot;backup&quot; (non-original) game discs. This requires opening of the console but no additional hardware such as a modchip is permanently installed into the system. Microsoft responded by introducing console ban system. If the data stream from the DVD drive indicated signs of unauthorized use, Microsoft would permanently ban the console from using Xbox Live service. The ban never expires and can only be fixed by purchasing another console. Other measures, such as introducing new hardware revisions to prevent modifications and checking/updating the drive firmware during dashboard updates, have been made too.

In August 2024, a savegame exploit affecting multiple consoles and generations called &quot;TonyHawksProStrcpy&quot; was released, which is present in Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland for the Xbox 360. It can be used to execute unsigned code. If used on a console with a dashboard version of 2.0.4548.0 or lower, it is possible to also chain a known hypervisor exploit and gain full control over the console. However, this is a very old update dating back to November 2006 and not readily available for most users, usually requiring downgrading which is not a simple process.

===Xbox One===
The Xbox One went through its lifecycle without having its security compromised. However, in June 2024, a userland exploit was disclosed for a Microsoft Store app called Game Script that had a bug which allowed for arbitrary code execution. Microsoft removed the app from the store a few days after disclosure, effectively patching the vulnerability for those who did not have it downloaded already.

A couple of weeks later, the same developer who published the userland exploit released a follow-up release which achieves kernel access while in Retail mode. This is roughly equivalent in functionality if the console was in Developer mode. Due to the Xbox One&#x27;s security architecture, the console security is still mostly intact and further mitigations are necessary in order to become a HEN (homebrew enabler).

A payload exists that starts a reverse shell on the console over the network, which for example can be used to browse the console&#x27;s filesystem and create directories.

===Xbox Series X and Series S===
The Xbox Series X and Series S are vulnerable to the same exploits for the Xbox One, and similarly have security measures where the console security is still mostly intact and further mitigations are necessary in order to become a HEN (homebrew enabler).

===GameCube===
There was an exploit within the game Phantasy Star Online port for the GameCube. It used the network adapter to download a malicious update containing unsigned code.

In August 2024, a savegame exploit affecting multiple consoles and generations called &quot;TonyHawksProStrcpy&quot; was released, which is present in multiple Tony Hawk&#x27;s titles for the GameCube. It can be used to execute unsigned code.

===Wii===
The first known softmod for the Wii is known as the Twilight hack, a savegame exploit for the Wii version of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. This allowed users to run unsigned code /.elf files.

The Twilight hack was superseded by the development of Bannerbomb, which allowed for executing unsigned code without relying on an exploit within a game. Bannerbomb worked by using a malformed banner to inject a loader program into the Wii Menu program in memory. As the Wii Menu crashed, an unsigned executable was executed.

Bannerbomb was superseded by Letterbomb, which used a glitch in the Wii Message Board to crash the Wii Menu.

FlashHax superseded Letterbomb, which used an exploit in the Wii&#x27;s End-user license agreement to run unsigned code, requiring the Internet Channel to be installed.

str2hax superseded FlashHax, which simplified the process even further. str2hax uses a custom DNS server to redirect the Wii&#x27;s End-user license agreement page to a modified page that executes unsigned code, without the need for the Internet Channel.

BlueBomb was later released that leveraged a Bluetooth exploit, in particular used to softmod the Wii Mini which could not use the Internet Browser as an exploit entry point.

Exploits typically allowed the install of the Homebrew Channel, an unofficial Wii channel which acted as a gateway to run unofficial Wii applications.

A large homebrew community emerged for the Wii, leading to developments such as the Homebrew Channel, third-party games, media players, and the loading of Wii and GameCube game backups.

===Wii U===
The Wii U can be softmodded with various exploits. As of February 2024 the easiest way to softmod a Wii U is by using the DNSpresso exploit which leverages several bugs in the network stack, and achieves kernel access, in addition to having a specially crafted SD card inserted. This works on the latest firmware revisions. This in turn can be used to install CFW (custom firmware). Currently the most supported CFW is Aroma. Other choices of CFW are Mocha, Haxchi, and Tiramisu.

Softmodding a Wii U allows users to run homebrew, load game backups, bypass region checks, and change fan and CPU/GPU speeds. Notably, the Wii U is backwards compatible with Wii games (vWii), however softmodding also unlocks backwards compatibility with GameCube games like its predecessor, as the hardware required to emulate is present on the motherboard - despite this, Nintendo did not implement GameCube disc reading for the Wii U, effectively disabling this backwards compatibility.

USB storage can be used to store games; this is the only way to store and play Wii U games outside of the internal memory. Wii and GameCube games can be played if stored on the specially crafted SD card used to softmod the Wii U, or if they are stored on USB storage.

Previously, a few &quot;Virtual DS&quot; games could be exploited with specially crafted savegames to install a permanent CFW which is active as soon as the console powers on. However, after the eShop closure this method is now impossible to do unless the game was downloaded pre closure.

===Nintendo DS/DS Lite===
All versions of the Nintendo DS as well as the Nintendo DS Lite can be softmodded using FlashMe: an exploit that can be installed using any PassMe compatible flashcart. The exploit consists of shorting two pins with any metallic object to make the NAND containing the firmware writable. The custom firmware looks and acts exactly the same as the original DS firmware except for the fact you will not need a PassMe or Passcard to boot DS roms from Slot-2 flashcarts anymore. The standard version of FlashMe removes the DS intro screen (including the Warning screen) when booting up. This method also allows for a scrapped DS Lite AV/Out feature to be used again with a Hardmod
===Nintendo DSi/DSi XL===
The Nintendo DSi made it easier to softmod the console with the introduction of an SD card slot. The easiest method method was the Memory Pit exploit released in 2019. When the camera application is used to take a photo, it creates a file called codice_1 to store metadata information. This file is always located at codice_2 on the SD card. By modifying this file, a buffer overflow is created, crashing the system. External tools like Unlaunch write directly to the NAND storage of the DSi and creates a cold-boot scenario (i.e. the console can directly launch into the custom firmware without having to use other apps). Custom UI environments have been created, most notably TWiLight Menu++ which facilitates other programs like nds-bootstrap to launch homebrew software.

===Nintendo 2DS/3DS===
The Nintendo 3DS (and its Nintendo 2DS sibling) have become some of the most popular console platforms to softmod, as the procedure requires only the 2DS/3DS itself, and modifying its microSD card. All models of 3DS and 2DS can be softmodded, including the &#x27;New&#x27; refresh models. Since the closure of the Nintendo eShop for the 2DS/3DS, softmodding has become popular in order to reinstate features that are now officially defunct.

The most well developed and commonly used CFW (Custom Firmware) is known as Luma3DS. It contains features such as EmuNAND (NAND redirection), running non-system menu payloads on boot, and installing homebrew titles to the main menu. A popular homebrew app used for piracy, known as Freeshop, was shut down by Nintendo with firmware 11.8 by requiring a title key authorization on the Eshop download servers, thus making all NUS downloaders for the 2DS/3DS to no longer function.

===Nintendo Switch===
Early versions of the Nintendo Switch known as &quot;V1 Unpatched&quot; are vulnerable to a ReCovery Mode (RCM) hardware exploit by holding the Volume Up button, Power button, and Tegra home button (not usually accessible to consumers), which boots the device into RCM, then connecting via USB to another device which is able to push payloads. Tegra refers to the chip the Nintendo Switch uses, the Tegra X1. This was an oversight as RCM was intended to be used by Nintendo to service consoles and not the consumer themselves. It was discovered the Tegra home button could be emulated by shorting pin 10 on the right JoyCon rail, initializing RCM. Once in this mode, an additional exploit in the Switch USB drivers can be leveraged to push payloads via USB to a Switch while in RCM to execute unsigned code, such as install CFW (custom firmware). The RCM exploit is hardware based and cannot be patched by software fixes.

Some firmware revisions have had a limited number of softmods emerge, although if updated the exploits will have been patched.

The softmods allow running homebrew, installing CFW (RCM exploit), bypass region checks, load game backups, and change fan and CPU/GPU speeds. With the RCM exploit it is also possible to install an Android distribution as an additional boot option, in which the device becomes much more versatile for cross platform play (such as the Xbox Game Pass), allowing games from other platforms to be played. The JoyCons are fully functional in an Android environment, making it a strong competitor for tablet gaming.

The most supported Nintendo Switch CFW is Atmosphère.

Nintendo has put safeguards in place where if a console tries to connect to a Nintendo server with a modified bootloader, or an unauthorised copy of a game is currently loaded, the device will be either bricked instantly, or eventually bricked after sending telemetry data to Nintendo servers. Once bricked, the console will be fingerprinted by Nintendo and will never be able to access a Nintendo server again, blocking access to the eShop, online play, amongst other features.

In December 2023, a group of hackers unveiled the first flash cartridge for the Switch, dubbed the Mig Switch. This cartridge accepts a microSD card that contains game backups, and the user can alternate between the loaded game by re-inserting the cartridge. The Mig Switch is safe to use online as long as an officially backed up game is used. If the cartridge used pirated files, is used by someone else, or runs homebrew files, the Switch will be flagged and banned. Mig Switch works on all models and firmware, partially defeating some of the security in order to play game backups, and also run homebrew.

==Computer DVD drives==
Some DVD drives, such as those made by Lite-on, can be softmodded to ignore region coding, allow clearing of the drive&#x27;s learned media calibration data, and enable DVD+R to DVD-ROM book type coding that is persistent across reboots. This is distinct from cross-flashing the drive or installing unofficial firmware, and does not modify the drive&#x27;s firmware.

<text>Patricia Jude Francis Kensit (born 4 March 1968) is an English actress and singer. Beginning her career as a child actor, Kensit gained attention when she acted in a string of commercials for Birds Eye frozen peas.

Balancing a dual career as both an actress and a singer, in 1983 Kensit formed and became the lead singer of the pop band Eighth Wonder. The group released several singles, including the top 20 hits &quot;I&#x27;m Not Scared&quot; and &quot;Cross My Heart&quot;, before disbanding in 1989. 

Kensit achieved further success in her breakthrough role as Suzette in the musical film &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986) and as Rika van den Haas in &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; (1989) before starring in the films &quot;Blue Tornado&quot; (1991), &quot;Timebomb&quot; (1991), &quot;Twenty-One&quot; (1991), &quot;Blame It on the Bellboy&quot; (1992), &quot;Bitter Harvest&quot; (1993), &quot;Full Eclipse&quot; (1993), &quot;Angels &amp; Insects&quot; (1995), &quot;Love and Betrayal&quot; (1995) and &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot; (1996).

==Early life and education==

Kensit&#x27;s maternal grandparents hailed from County Leitrim, Ireland. She has an older brother. Her mother was a secretary at Dior and former model, who had previously dated Aga Khan IV, while Kensit&#x27;s father was a close associate of both the Kray Twins and the Richardson Gang, earning himself the nickname &quot;Jimmy the Dip&quot;, and was involved in the Great Train Robbery. He served time in prison before Kensit was born and used a cover as an antiques dealer. Kensit&#x27;s godfather was Reggie Kray. Her paternal grandfather was a robber and counterfeiter. 

Kensit spent her childhood living on a council estate in Hounslow and had to sleep on mattresses on the floor. She attended Newland House School, St Catherine&#x27;s School, Twickenham, and Corona Theatre School.

==Career==

In 1972, at the age of four, Kensit appeared in a television advert for Birds Eye frozen peas. She had her first big-screen role in the film &quot;For the Love of Ada&quot;. Her next film role was two years later in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, the latter of whom she portrayed in the 1995 biopic, &quot;Love and Betrayal: The Mia Farrow Story&quot;. Later in 1974, she had a small role in the thriller film &quot;Gold&quot; alongside Roger Moore and Susannah York. She then starred in &quot;Alfie Darling&quot; (1975) with Joan Collins.

In 1983, with her brother Jamie Kensit, she helped set up the band Eighth Wonder, which included Steve Grantley and Geoff Beauchamp.

In 1985, Kensit pursued a dual career as a singer and an actress. She starred as Eppie in an adaptation of &quot;Silas Marner&quot;, with Ben Kingsley. At the time, Kensit stated: &quot;All I want is to be more famous than anything or anyone&quot;.

The cool control with which she executes the role is admirable&quot;. In 1992, she had a leading role in the British film &quot;Blame it on the Bellboy&quot; as Miss Carolyn Wright, a desperate estate agent in Venice who would stop at nothing to clinch a deal.

<doc id="882455" wikidata="Q2940562" url="?curid=882455" title="Carterfone">
<text>The Carterfone is a device invented by Thomas Carter. It connects a two-way radio system to the telephone system, allowing someone on the radio to talk to someone on the phone. This makes it a direct predecessor to today&#x27;s autopatch. The connection is acoustic -- sound travels through the air between the Carterfone and a conventional telephone that is part of the telephone system.

The reason the Carterfone connected the telephone and radio acoustically, instead of electrically, is that telephone network owners were legally allowed to and did bar devices they did not own from being connected electrically to their networks.

The Carterfone decision (13 F.C.C.2d 420) was a landmark United States regulatory decision that opened the public switched telephone network (PSTN) in America to customer-premises equipment (CPE). Twelve years earlier, a court had ruled in the Hush-A-Phone case that devices could &quot;mechanically&quot; connect to the telephone system (such as a rubber cup attached to a phone-company-owned telephone) without the permission of AT&amp;T. In 1968, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) extended this privilege by allowing the Carterfone and other devices to be connected &quot;electrically&quot; to the AT&amp;T network, as long as they did not cause harm to the system.

==Description==
The device is acoustically, but not electrically, connected to the public switched telephone network. It was electrically connected to the base station of the mobile radio system, and got its power from the base station. All electrical parts were encased in bakelite, an early plastic.

When someone on a two-way radio wished to speak to someone on phone, or &quot;landline&quot; (e.g., &quot;Central dispatch, patch me through to McGarrett&quot;), the station operator at the base would dial the telephone number. When callers on the radio and on the telephone were both in contact with the base station operator, the handset of the operator&#x27;s telephone was placed on a cradle built into the Carterfone device. A voice-operated switch in the Carterfone automatically switched on the radio transmitter when the telephone caller was speaking; when they stopped speaking, the radio returned to a receiving condition. A separate speaker was attached to the Carterfone to allow the base station operator to monitor the conversation, adjust the voice volume, and hang up their telephone when the conversation had ended.

==Landmark regulatory decision== 

This particular device was involved in a landmark United States regulatory decision related to telecommunications. In a twelve-year prior decision from 1956, a court had ruled in the Hush-A-Phone case that devices could &quot;mechanically&quot; connect to the telephone system (such as a rubber cup attached to a phone-company-owned telephone) without the permission of AT&amp;T. In 1968, the Federal Communications Commission extended this privilege by allowing the Carterfone and other devices to be connected electrically to the AT&amp;T network, as long as they did not cause harm to the system. This ruling, commonly called &quot;the Carterfone decision&quot; (13 F.C.C.2d 420), created the possibility of selling devices that could connect to the phone system using a protective coupler and opened the market to customer-premises equipment. The decision is often referred to as &quot;any lawful device&quot;, allowing later innovations like answering machines, fax machines, and modems (which initially used the same type of manual acoustic coupler as the Carterfone) to proliferate.

In February 2007, a petition for rulemaking was filed with the FCC by Skype, requesting the FCC to apply the Carterfone regulations to the wireless industry—which would mean that OEMs, portals and others will be able to offer wireless devices and services without the cellular operators needing to approve the handsets. However, on April 1, 2008, FCC chairman Kevin Martin indicated that he would oppose Skype&#x27;s request. On April 17, 2015, this petition for rulemaking was dismissed without prejudice by the FCC at the request of Skype&#x27;s current owner, Microsoft Corporation.

<doc id="882459" wikidata="Q7574598" url="?curid=882459" title="Special Investigation Branch">
<text>Special Investigation Branch (SIB) was the name given to the detective branches of all three British military police arms: the Royal Navy Police, Royal Military Police and Royal Air Force Police. It was most closely associated with the Royal Military Police, which had the largest SIB. SIB investigators usually operated in plain clothes, although they did wear uniforms when serving overseas. Members were usually senior non-commissioned officers (sergeants or petty officers or above) or commissioned officers, although the Royal Air Force SIB was open to corporals and Acting Corporals. In December 2022, the new tri-service Defence Serious Crime Unit replaced all three service SIBs, which were disbanded.

==Royal Navy Police SIB==
The Royal Navy SIB was the smallest of the three SIBs, with the SIO holding the rank of Lieutenant Commander. They investigated:

all incidents falling within Schedule 2 of the Armed Forces Act 2006;
* Level 3/4 investigations;
* circumstances prescribed in accordance with the Armed Forces Act 2006;
* complicated cases involving multiple units (for instance, assaults involving a large number of personnel from different ships).

==Royal Military Police SIB==
Although an SIB appears to have existed in the British Army of the Rhine in Germany between 1919 and 1926, the origins of the army&#x27;s SIB are in 1940, when twenty Scotland Yard detectives were enlisted in the Corps of Military Police to deal with the pilfering of military stores within the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. The unit was formed on the recommendations of Detective Chief Inspector George Hatherill (who later went on to investigate the serial killers John Reginald Christie and John George Haigh, and the Great Train Robbery) and command was given to Detective Superintendent Clarence Campion, head of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Criminal Record Office, who was commissioned as a Major. Campion was hit in the head by shrapnel during the Dunkirk evacuation and died on 20 May 1940, the only SIB casualty of the BEF. After this beginning, the SIB was established on a full-time basis. One of the first group of detectives, Frank Elliott, was sent out to Cairo, Egypt. Under the supervision of Colonel Claude Harper, Elliott managed a 500-man force which investigated crime in Egypt, Palestine and later Libya.

The SIB (RMP) consisted of about three hundred personnel, including Scenes of Crime Officers and forensic technicians. It was divided into numbered units called Investigation Platoons (for instance, 33 Inv Pl SIB Regt), which are subdivided into Detachments, each usually commanded by a Warrant Officer Class 2. There was a section or detachment on most major British Army stations. There was also a Territorial Army section, made up of CID officers and ex-regular SIB. The Headquarters SIB Regiment was located at Campion Lines at Bulford, Wiltshire. Within the RMP, SIB is known as &quot;the Branch&quot; or more commonly &quot;the Feds&quot;.

In 2006 the SIB was subjected to an inspection by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). The Armed Forces Bill 2006 seeks to require the SIB to refer investigations into inherently serious crimes directly to the Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA) rather than to commanding officers.

SIB recruit class 1 and 2 Cpl&#x27;s from the General Police Duties employment group of the Royal Military Police, and each candidate undergoes 12 months Foundation Training to determine suitability. During training, an extensive testing phase is completed utilizing the Distance Learning Package (DLP), coupled with a series of exams including the entrance exam. Students who pass the entrance exam are eligible for further training on the Serious Crime Investigation Course (SCIC), a 9-week residential course held at the Defence School of Policing and Guarding, Southwick Park, Fareham. On completion, successful candidates are placed onto a merit board awaiting full-time employment as an SIB Investigator. Passing the SCIC does not automatically qualify candidates employment with the SIB, and all candidates who were successful in passing the SCIC but unsuitable for employment with the SIB will be returned to their respective unit as a Level 3 trained investigator.

==Royal Air Force Police SIB==
The Royal Air Force Police Special Investigation Branch, formed in 1918, had the distinction of being the only branch-specific investigative unit entrusted with a major war crime. Five officers and fourteen NCOs were given the assignment of investigating the Stalag Luft III murders immediately following the Second World War. In direct recognition of this, the RAF Police SIB was granted permission to use The Great Escape March as its distinct march by CAS in 2015.

The Royal Air Force Police previously had one SIB Squadron based at RAF Halton with two subordinate Flights: SIB A Flt based at RAF Halton, and SIB B Flt based at RAF College Cranwell, this Squadron sits within No. 1 Specialist Police Wing.

Personnel undertook the Serious Crime Investigation Course (SCIC) before going on to complete a number of Home Office courses such as SOIT, National drugs, and Tier 2,3 &amp; 5 interviewer, Family Liaison Officer, Specialist Fraud etc.

The RAF Police SIB differed slightly from its RMP counterparts in terms of rank structure, employing a mix of Corporals and Sergeants. Both SIB(S) and SIB(N) additionally employ a number of Acting Corporals.

SIB personnel extensively deployed with their RMP SIB counterparts throughout the duration of Operation Banner, Northern Ireland; Operation Telic, Iraq; and Operation Herrick, Afghanistan in support of combat operations.

Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary conducted an inspection of the SIB in 2009.

==Disbandment and replacement==
In 2017 a Service Justice System review commenced that evaluated the current Service Justice System, and identify ways the system could be improved, led by retired senior Crown Court judge Shaun Lyons. The second report from this review, &quot;Service Justice System Policing&quot; evaluated the special police organizations, which included special investigation bureaus.

The report identified the three individual SIBs as being inefficient and actually interfering with investigations, with skill and experience issues and &quot;overlap of function, duplication of effort, poor intelligence flows and an absence of skill transfer&quot;. The report turned to a similar issue that had been identified in the early 2000s where individual civilian police forces were increasingly unable to cope with increasingly complex and international organized crime investigations. The solution was setting up Regional Organised Crime Units that united personnel and resources, that better facilitated improvements in investigations and the flow of intelligence between units.

In December 2022, the Defence Serious Crime Unit was formed to replace the three separate strands of single service SIBs. It is headquartered at Southwick Park, and comprises personnel from all three services. Its remit is to investigate serious crimes outside of the normal chain of command.

<doc id="882464" wikidata="Q528839" url="?curid=882464" title="Philip Michael Thomas">
<text>Philip Michael Thomas (born May 26, 1949) is a retired American actor and musician, best known for his role as detective Ricardo Tubbs on the hit 1980s TV series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. His first notable roles were in &quot;Coonskin&quot; (1975) and opposite Irene Cara in the 1976 film &quot;Sparkle&quot;. After his success in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, he appeared in numerous made-for-TV movies and advertisements for telephone psychic services. He also voiced the character Lance Vance in the video games &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; (2002) and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot; (2006).

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Columbus, Ohio, but grew up in San Bernardino, California. He is of African American, Native American, Irish, and German descent. His father, Louis Diggs, was a foreman at a Westinghouse plant. Thomas&#x27;s mother was Lulu McMorris. He and his seven half brothers and sisters had the surname Thomas, which was the last name of his mother&#x27;s first husband.

As a child, he acted in his church&#x27;s theater group and, at age 15, while participating in the Pentecostal Delman Heights Four Square Gospel Church choir, became interested in ministry. He graduated from San Bernardino High School in 1967 and briefly worked as a janitor to save money for college. He earned a scholarship to the historically Black Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, where he studied religion and philosophy.

After two years at Oakwood College, Thomas transferred to the University of California, Riverside. During that time, he auditioned for and was cast in the San Francisco production of &quot;Hair&quot;, beginning his acting career. He quit college to pursue acting as a profession, appearing in several features during the 1970s - including the classic musical drama &quot;Sparkle&quot; (1976). His big break came in 1984, when he landed a starring role in the popular television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; alongside Don Johnson.

==Career==
===Acting===

====&quot;Miami Vice&quot;====
In 1984, Thomas began playing the role of Ricardo Tubbs, an ex-NYPD police officer from the Bronx who came to Miami seeking revenge on the person who killed his brother Rafael Tubbs. In Miami he encounters another undercover cop, Sonny Crockett, who is coincidentally looking for the same person. Thomas was reportedly paid $25,000 (equivalent to $ today) per episode for Seasons 1–2. In 1986, he was given an increase to $50,000 ($) per episode for Seasons 3–5. Johnson was paid $30,000 ($) per episode for Seasons 1-2 and $90,000 ($) per episode for Seasons 3–5.

Thomas coined the acronym &quot;EGOT&quot;, meaning &quot;Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony&quot;, in reference to his plans for winning all four. He has not, , been nominated for any of these awards, but has received a People&#x27;s Choice Award and a Golden Globe nomination.

====&quot;Extralarge&quot; &amp; &quot;We Are Angels&quot;====
Thomas starred in the six-part television mini-series, &quot;Extralarge&quot; with Bud Spencer in 1991. Thomas was replaced by Michael Winslow for the second series. Thomas teamed up again with Spencer when they starred in another mini-series called &quot;We Are Angels&quot; released in 1997.

====&quot;Nash Bridges&quot;====
In 1997, Thomas was reunited with Don Johnson for two appearances in the police drama &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. He played Cedrick &quot;Rick&quot; Hawks, a Deputy United States Marshal from Miami visiting Bridges (Johnson) in San Francisco. His first appearance was in the episode &quot;Wild Card&quot;, and his second and final appearance was in the episode &quot;Out of Miami&quot;, which aired in 2001 during the program&#x27;s final season.

====&quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;====
In 2002, Thomas did a voice-over in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; as Lance Vance, a supporting character who aids the game&#x27;s protagonist, Tommy Vercetti, in several story missions while trying to avenge the death of his brother, Victor Vance, who was killed in a botched drug deal with Tommy at the beginning of the game. He reprised the role in the 2006 prequel &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;, which is about Lance&#x27;s arrival in Vice City, the beginning of his involvement in the drug business, and his relationship with Victor.

===Music===
In 1985, Thomas released a music album titled &quot;Living the Book of My Life&quot; under his own record label called Spaceship Records. It sold poorly and failed to produce a hit single, although Thomas produced a video for the track &quot;Just the Way I Planned It&quot;. He performed the title song of the album during the 1985 &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;The Maze.&quot; The episode &quot;Trust Fund Pirates&quot; featured another song of his, &quot;La Mirada&quot;. His &quot;Miami Vice&quot; co-star Don Johnson recorded an album shortly afterward titled &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. In 1987, Thomas recorded a song called &quot;Ever and Forever&quot; with Argentine singer Lucía Galán of Pimpinela fame.

Thomas released a second album, &quot;Somebody&quot;, in 1988. It also failed to produce a hit and sold poorly. In 1993, Thomas teamed with Kathy Rahill to compose &quot;My, My, My, Miam...I&quot;, which was chosen to be the city of Miami&#x27;s theme song. That same year, Thomas teamed with Jamaican fitness instructor Sandi Morais to compose songs for a family-friendly musical titled &quot;Sacha&quot;, which enjoyed runs in south Florida and New York. The two formed the Magic Cookie Production Company. Thomas produced the music for Morais&#x27; fitness videos in 2001 and 2006.

===Psychic Reader&#x27;s Network===
In 1994, Thomas signed an agreement with Psychic Reader&#x27;s Network (later known as Traffix, Inc.) based in Melbourne, Florida, becoming the spokesman for the Philip Michael Thomas International Psychic Network. He appeared in television ads and claimed to have met the planet&#x27;s premier psychics through his &quot;world travels&quot;. He dressed similarly to his &quot;Miami Vice&quot; alter ego, even opening the ads with the phrase, &quot;From Miami Vice to world advice!&quot; He appeared in informercials with Eileen Brennan and Todd McKee along with his daughter, Sacha Nicole, promoting the psychic line. Thomas released a cassette of music linked to his psychic business titled &quot;PMT Psychic Connection, Volume I&quot;.

Traffix replaced Thomas with Miss Cleo. He sued, alleging breach of contract, and won. In 2002, a New York arbitrator awarded Thomas $1.48 million for the improper use of his name and likeness and an additional $780,000 in interest.

==Personal life==
Thomas is a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker. In 1986, he was sued for child support by Dhaima Matthews, the mother of his then 2-year-old daughter and 9-week-old son. Thomas later married model Kassandra Green. Green filed a domestic violence complaint against Thomas in 1997, during which time she was described as being the mother of 5 of his 12 children. Thomas dismissed the complaint as &quot;an absolute, blatant lie&quot;.

<doc id="882465" wikidata="Q4148426" url="?curid=882465" title="Graceland Cemetery">
<text>Graceland Cemetery is a large historic garden cemetery located in the north side community area of Uptown, in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Established in 1860, its main entrance is at the intersection of Clark Street and Irving Park Road. Among the cemetery&#x27;s are the burial sites of several well-known Chicagoans.

Graceland includes a naturalistic reflecting lake, surrounded by winding pathways, and its pastoral plantings have led it to become a certified arboretum of more than 2,000 trees. The cemetery&#x27;s wide variety of burial monuments include a number designed by famous architects, several of whom are also buried in the cemetery.

==History==
===Establishment===
Thomas Barbour Bryan, a Chicago businessman, established Graceland Cemetery in 1860 with the original layout designed by Swain Nelson. Bryan created it though a business partnership with William Butler Ogden, Sidney Sawyer, Edwin H. Sheldon, and George Peter Alexander Healy. Bryan was the inaugural president of the Graceland Cemetery Association, with Healy serving as treasurer.

Bryan had been motivated to establish a new cemetery after being disappointed by the &quot;neglected and actually repulsive condition&quot; of Chicago&#x27;s City Cemetery when his son Daniel was buried there. He sought to create a &quot;rural burying ground, more remote from and worthy of the city [of Chicago].&quot; but he placed his ambition on hold after Rosehill Cemetery was opened by a group independent of Bryan. However, after he was offered the presidency of the company that operated Rosehill Cemetery, Bryan became motivated to pursue his shelved plans to establish his own cemetery.

Bryan purchased land for his cemetery from the heirs of Justin Butterfield. He collaborated with a several landscape architects to design the cemetery and fought challenges from the owners of adjacent properties who opposed his plans. In April 1860, the first burial at Graceland Cemetery occurred when Bryan&#x27;s son Daniel was reinterred. Graceland Cemetery was formally dedicated that August.

===19th century operations===
Daniel Page Bryan&#x27;s disinterment from City Cemetery was an early part of the greater process of relocating the thousands of remains at the City Cemetery and transforming that site into a public park. The remains of approximately 2,000 individuals were relocated in this process, which was completed in the 1870s. Graceland and Rosehill were the reburial sites of many of these remains. Graceland quickly established itself as a popular choice of burial site for prominent Chicagoans, with many opting to pre-erect burial monuments at the cemetery for their future burials. In 1870, Horace Cleveland designed curving paths, open vistas, and a small lake to create a park-like setting.

In 1878, Bryan hired his nephew Bryan Lathrop as president. In 1879, the cemetery acquired an additional , and Ossian Cole Simonds was hired as its landscape architect to design the addition. Lathrop and Simonds wanted to incorporate naturalistic settings to create picturesque views that were the foundation of the Prairie style. Lathrop was open to new ideas and provided opportunities for experimentation which led to Simonds use of native plants including oak, ash, witch hazel, and dogwood at a time when many viewed native plants as invasive. The Graceland Cemetery Association designated one section of the grounds to be devoid of monuments and instituted a review process led by Simonds for monuments and family plots. Simonds later became the superintendent at Graceland until 1897, and continued on as a consultant until his death in 1931.

===20th century===
Graceland&#x27;s attractive parklike appearance and elaborate burial monuments made it a popular site. Visitation became so large, that in the early 20th century its operators grew concerned that it had turned too popular as a recreation grounds, to the detriment of its character as a cemetery. For a period, it instituted a policy in which open admission to the grounds was only permitted on Sundays and holidays, with the remaining dates seeing access limited to ticket holders. Graceland&#x27;s popularity as a pleasure grounds declined in subsequent decades, however, as public attitude moved away from seeing cemeteries as appropriate sites for leisure. At the same time, the condition of the cemetery began to suffer from neglect.

===21st century===
In the early 21st century, attention was turned to repair the cemetery and restore much of its 19th-century landscape. Graceland Cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 18, 2001.

In 2020, the cemetery&#x27;s landscape was damaged in a derecho (severe windstorm) that uprooted 50 mature trees. The cemetery was closed for several weeks thereafter to clean up the damage. Young trees were planted to replace the mature trees that were lost.

== Geography ==
Graceland Cemetery is an example of a rural cemetery, which is a style of cemetery characterized by landscaped natural areas. The concept of the rural cemetery emerged in the early 19th century as a response to overcrowding and poor maintenance in existing cemeteries in Europe.

In the 19th century, a train to the north suburbs occupied the eastern edge of the cemetery, where the Chicago &quot;L&quot; train now runs. The line was also used to carry mourners to funerals, in specially rented funeral cars. As a result, there was an entry through the east wall, which has since been closed. When founded, the cemetery was well outside the city limits of Chicago. After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, Lincoln Park, which had been the city&#x27;s cemetery, was deconsecrated and some of the bodies were reinterred to Graceland Cemetery.

The edge of the pond around Daniel Burnham&#x27;s burial island was once lined with broken headstones and coping transported from Lincoln Park. Lincoln Park was redeveloped as a recreational area. A single mausoleum remains, the &quot;Couch tomb&quot;, containing the remains of Ira Couch. The Couch Tomb is probably the oldest extant structure in the city, everything else having been destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire.

The cemetery&#x27;s walls are topped off with wrought iron spear point fencing.

==Notable tombs and monuments==
Many of the cemetery&#x27;s tombs are of great architectural or artistic interest, including the Getty Tomb, the Martin Ryerson Mausoleum (both designed by architect Louis Sullivan, who is also buried in the cemetery), and the Schoenhofen Pyramid Mausoleum. The industrialist George Pullman was buried at night, in a lead-lined coffin within an elaborately reinforced steel-and-concrete vault, to prevent his body from being exhumed and desecrated by labor activists.

William Hulbert, the first president of the National League, has a monument in the shape of a baseball with the names of the original National League cities on it.

Along with its other famous burials, the cemetery is notable for two statues by the renowned Chicago sculptor Lorado Taft, &quot;Eternal Silence&quot; for the Graves family plot and &quot;The Crusader&quot; that marks Victor Lawson&#x27;s final resting place.

The cemetery is also the final resting place of 31 victims of the Iroquois Theatre fire, in which more than 600 people died.

Six-year-old Inez Briggs, the &quot;girl in glass&quot; is rumored to be a haunted site.

<text>The Pacific Islanders was a combined international rugby union team that played from 2004 to 2008. It represented Fiji, Samoa and Tonga; Niue and the Cook Islands also supplied players to the squad for their tour in 2004. The team did not play at Rugby World Cups, where each of the nations continued to represent themselves.

==History==

===Australia/New Zealand 2004===
The Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) was formed in 2003. The coach is appointed by the Islanders board and in turn supported by the national coaches of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. Its team, the Pacific Islanders, is drawn from the best Fijian, Tongan and Samoan players, and created great interest in their inaugural 2004 tour. They lost every game, 29-14 v Australia, 41-26 v New Zealand and 38-24 v South Africa. The Islanders did beat a Queensland XV 48-29 at Ballymore and NSW Waratahs 68-21 at Australia Stadium.

===Celtic Nations 2006===

As the individual nations were primarily concerned with qualifying for the next World Cup the Islanders did not tour again until 2006. Scheduled matches against Italy and New Zealand in June 2006 did not take place, but they undertook a Northern Hemisphere tour in late 2006 with matches against Scotland, Wales and Ireland. PIRA had ruled in July 2006 that the team selected for that year&#x27;s tour to Great Britain and Ireland would consist only of players who had previously played for Fiji, Manu Samoa or Tonga. This was intended to ensure that the Pacific Islanders team serves to develop players for the island nations only. Notably, two players on the 2004 tour, Sione Lauaki and Sitiveni Sivivatu (the latter the Islanders&#x27; leading scorer on that tour), went on to play for New Zealand. During that tour, they were the last opponents of at their traditional home of Lansdowne Road before its redevelopment into a modern all-seater stadium. The Pacific Islanders were beaten in all three matches.

===Europe 2008===
In November 2008, the team toured Europe and played Tests against England, France and Italy. The team&#x27;s manager was Major-General Sitiveni Rabuka, former Prime Minister of Fiji and author of two military coups in 1987. Though it began with two defeats, the tour ended with the Islanders&#x27; first ever win over European opposition, with a 25-17 victory in Italy.

===Alliance ends in 2009===
In July 2009, the Samoa Rugby Union informed fellow Alliance members Fiji and Tonga that it had decided to quit the alliance because the merged Pacific Island team had failed to produce financial benefits sought by member unions.

==Future status==

There was speculation that the Islanders would be admitted into an expanded Super 12 competition or the Tri Nations Series, but instead the organisers of the Super 12 and the Tri Nations, SANZAR, opted to expand the Super 14 by adding one team each in Australia and South Africa and an extra round of fixtures to the Tri Nations without admitting any new teams. French businessman Eric Series, owner of the Asia Pacific Dragons team, proposed a Pacific Islands team for the 2016 Super Rugby season but was outbid by the Japan Rugby Football Union.

In 2014, a match between the Pacific Islanders and the British &amp; Irish Lions was proposed for the 2017 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, but the match was never scheduled.

==Squad==












*Two further players were originally included in the squad Sireli Bobo and Soane Tongaʻuiha. However Bobo became unavailable, and Tongaʻuiha later withdrew from the tour.

<doc id="882479" wikidata="Q1285875" url="?curid=882479" title="Edmonton Road Runners">
<text>The Edmonton Road Runners were an ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada at Rexall Place.

==History==
After the 2003–04 season the Edmonton Oilers announced that the Toronto Roadrunners would play the 2004–05 season in Edmonton, where they were based in the Oilers&#x27; own arena, Rexall Place. The NHL team&#x27;s decision to re-locate its affiliate to Edmonton was an unusual one for a North American professional sports organization, and was likely influenced by the expectation that the 2004–05 NHL lockout would wipe out the 2004–05 NHL season. The expectation proved accurate, as the season was officially cancelled on February 16, 2005. With no NHL hockey for the season, the team proved highly successful at the gate, finishing third in the AHL in attendance at 8,854 fans per game despite a disappointing season plagued by injury.

Despite the franchise&#x27;s short term success, the Oilers&#x27; owners realized that Edmonton could probably not support both NHL and AHL franchises in the long term, and Edmonton was never intended to be a permanent location for the Roadrunners. The eventual plan was to re-locate the Roadrunners to Credit Union Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan as part of a transaction that would have re-located the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Saskatoon Blades to Edmonton in exchange. However, an agreement could not be reached with the owners of the Blades. Without their backing Credit Union Centre was unavailable to the Roadrunners as the terms of the Blades&#x27; lease precludes its abrogation save for the relocation of an NHL team to the facility. As a result, the team announced on June 6, 2005 that they were requesting permission from the American Hockey League to suspend team operations. The decision was likely motivated by the improving lockout negotiations and the widespread belief that the Oilers would be back for the 2005–06 season, which was confirmed when the owners and players agreed on July 13, 2005, to a new six-year collective bargaining agreement.

Though the Oilers chose first to maintain split AHL affiliations in 2005–06 and 2007–08, then make a conventional agreement with the Springfield Falcons for the next three seasons, they retained the rights to the dormant Road Runners franchise. The franchise was resurrected as the Oklahoma City Barons in the 2010–11 season.

<doc id="882485" wikidata="Q10666486" url="?curid=882485" title="Session musician">
<text>A session musician (also known as studio musician or backing musician) is a musician hired to perform in a recording session or a live performance. The term sideman is also used in the case of live performances, such as accompanying a recording artist on a tour. Session musicians are usually not permanent or official members of a musical ensemble or band.

Many session musicians specialize in playing common rhythm section instruments such as guitar, piano, bass, or drums. Others are specialists, and play brass, woodwinds, and strings. 
Many session musicians play multiple instruments, which lets them play in a wider range of musical situations, genres, and styles. Examples of &quot;doubling&quot; include double bass and electric bass, acoustic guitar and mandolin, piano and accordion, and saxophone and other woodwind instruments.

Session musicians are used when musical skills are needed on a short-term basis. Typically, session musicians are used by recording studios to provide backing tracks for other musicians for recording sessions and live performances, recording music for advertising, film, television, and theatre.

In the 2000s, the terms &quot;session musician&quot; and &quot;studio musician&quot; were synonymous, though in past decades, &quot;studio musician&quot; meant a musician associated with a single record company, recording studio or entertainment agency.

Session musicians rarely achieve mainstream fame in their own right as soloists or bandleaders. However, top session musicians are well-known within the music industry. Some have become publicly recognized, such as the Wrecking Crew, the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section and The Funk Brothers who worked with Motown Records.

==Approaches==

Session musicians may play in a wide range of genres or specialize in a specific genre (e.g., country music or jazz). Some session musicians with a classical music background may focus on film score recordings. Even within a specific genre specialization, there may be even more focused sub-specializations. For example, a sub-specialization within trumpet session players is &quot;high note specialist.&quot; 

The working schedule for session musicians often depends on the terms set out by musicians&#x27; unions or associations, as these organizations typically set out rules on performance schedules (e.g., regarding the length of sessions and breaks). The length of employment may be as short as a single day, in the case of recording a brief demo song, or as long as several weeks if an album or film score is being recorded.

Musicians&#x27; associations and unions often set out the remuneration terms. Some musicians may get the minimum scale rate set out by the union. Heavily in-demand session musicians may earn much more. The union rates may vary based on whether it is a music recording versus a film/television recording. While the film/television rates may be lower, there may also be residual payments to compensate them for reruns, DVD sales, streaming usage, and so on.

Session musicians often have to bring their own instruments, such as in the case of guitar, bass, woodwinds, and brass. It is expected that studio musicians will have well-maintained professional-tier instruments. In some cases, larger or heavier instruments may be provided by the recording studio, such as a grand piano or Hammond organ and Leslie speaker. In certain cases, a session musicians may bring some instruments or musical gear and use them with larger instruments that are provided by the studio, such as a synthesizer player, who might bring rack-mounted synth modules and connect them to the studio&#x27;s MIDI controller stage piano. Similarly, if the studio has a selection of well-known bass amplifiers, and speaker cabinets, a bass player may only have to bring bass guitars and effect units.

The requirement to read different types of music notation, improvise and/or &quot;play by ear&quot; varies according to the type of recording session and the genres of music being performed. Classical musicians and many jazz and popular music musicians are expected to read music notation and do sight-reading. In jazz, rock, and many popular music genres, performers may be expected to read chord charts and improvise accompaniment and solos. In country music, performers may be expected to read Nashville Number System charts and improvise accompaniment and solos. In many traditional and folk music styles, performers are expected to be able to play by ear. 

Session musicians need a nuanced sense of the playing styles and idioms used in different genres. For example, a sax player who mainly plays jazz needs to know the R&amp;B style if they are asked to improvise a solo in an R&amp;B song. Similarly, a bass player asked to improvise a walking bassline in a rockabilly song needs to know the stock lines and clichés used in this genre.

Regardless of the styles of music session musicians play, some qualities are universal: punctuality in arriving at the session; rhythmic and intonation precision; ability to play with good ensemble and excellent blending with the other performers; willingness to take direction from bandleaders, music directors, and music producers; and having good musical taste in regards to choices with musical ornaments and musical phrasing.

==History==

===1950s–1960s===
During the 1950s and 1960s, session players were usually active in local recording scenes concentrated in places such as Los Angeles, New York City, Nashville, Memphis, Detroit, and Muscle Shoals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memphis/Nashville/Muscle Shoals&quot;&gt;Source A: Source B:Source C:&lt;/ref&gt; Each local scene had its circle of &quot;A-list&quot; session musicians, such as The Nashville A-Team that played on numerous country and rock hits of the era, the two groups of musicians in Memphis, both the Memphis Boys and the musicians who backed Stax/Volt recordings, and the Funk Brothers in Detroit, who played on many Motown recordings.

At the time, multi-tracking equipment, though common, was less elaborate, and instrumental backing tracks were often recorded &quot;hot&quot; with an ensemble playing live in the studio. Musicians had to be available &quot;on call&quot; when producers needed a part to fill a last-minute time slot. In the 1960s, Los Angeles was considered the top recording destination in the United States — consequently studios were constantly booked around the clock, and session time was highly sought after and expensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;JazzWax (Byrds/studio expense)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Songs had to be recorded quickly in the fewest possible takes. In this environment, Los Angeles producers and record executives had little patience for needless expense or wasted time and depended on the service of reliable standby musicians who could be counted on to record in a variety of styles with minimal practice or takes, and deliver hits on short order.

==Studio band==
A &quot;studio band&quot; is a musical ensemble that is in the employ of a recording studio for the purpose of accompanying recording artists who are customers of the studio. The use of studio bands was more common during the 1960s with groups such Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. The benefit of having a regular group, an approach which typified Southern soul, is that the group has much more experience playing together, which enables them to get a better sense of ensemble.

===Notable groups===

* The Nashville A-Team (Nashville, 1950s–1960s)
: Studio musicians who recorded during the Nashville sound era. Their contributions began in the 1950s with artists such as Elvis Presley. The original A-Team includes bassist Bob Moore; guitarists Grady Martin, Hank Garland, Ray Edenton, and Harold Bradley; drummer Buddy Harman; pianists Floyd Cramer and Hargus &quot;Pig&quot; Robbins; fiddler Tommy Jackson; steel guitarist Pete Drake; harmonicist Charlie McCoy; saxophonist Boots Randolph; and vocal groups The Jordanaires and The Anita Kerr Singers. Cramer, McCoy, and Randolph, along with later A-Teamer and producer Chet Atkins, would later emerge as part of &quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; Million Dollar Band in the 1980s.

* The Brill Building Sound (New York City, 1960s)
:A collection of musicians based at the Brill Building at 1619 Broadway and the Aldon Music Allegro Studios at 1650 Broadway. The two locations were already producing popular music in the 1940s as Tin Pan Alley had been waning; it was in the late 1950s and early 1960s that a distinct Brill Building sound began to coalesce, which backed musicians such as The Four Seasons, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Darin, and the early girl groups associated with Phil Spector, who later built upon his work at the Brill Building into his more famous Wall of Sound. Many of the Brill Building studio musicians were themselves recording artists and songwriters.

* Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s (Memphis, 1960s–1970s)
: The house band at Stax records in Memphis during the 1960s and 1970s, playing behind Otis Redding, Eddie Floyd, Sam and Dave, Isaac Hayes, The Staple Singers, and others. M.G.&#x27;s guitarist Steve Cropper co-wrote many of Redding&#x27;s hits, and the M.G.&#x27;s produced albums and hit singles such as &quot;Green Onions&quot; in their own right while being the house band at Stax.

* The Wrecking Crew (Los Angeles, 1960s–1970s)
: Prolific, established studio musicians based in Los Angeles, among which bassist Carol Kaye stands out as one of the rare female instrumentalists. They have recorded many songs and albums since the 1960s. 

* The Ron Hicklin Singers (Los Angeles, 1960s-1980s)
: A vocal session group closely associated with the Wrecking Crew and appeared as backing vocalists on many of the Crew&#x27;s recordings, including T.V. and movie themes and radio and television commercials.

* The Blossoms (Los Angeles, 1950s-1970s)
: An all-female vocal group featuring Darlene Love, which was closely associated with the Wrecking Crew and with Phil Spector, appeared as backing vocalists on many of their recordings. From 1964 to 1966, they were featured vocalists on the weekly rock&#x27; n&#x27; roll television program &quot;Shindig!&quot;

* The Funk Brothers (Detroit, 1960s–1970s)
: Session musicians who backed many Motown Records recordings from the late 1950s to the early 1970s as well as a few non-Motown recordings, notably on Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot;.

* The Andantes (Detroit, 1960s-1970s)
: An all-female trio of backing vocalists who backed many Motown Records artists from the late 1950s to the early 1970s as well as a few non-Motown artists, including Jackie Wilson, Betty Everett, and John Lee Hooker. Closely associated with the Funk Brothers.

* The Memphis Boys (Memphis, 1960s)
: Session musicians who served as American Sound Studio&#x27;s house band. They backed such artists as Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley, Wilson Pickett, Joe Tex, Neil Diamond, and Dusty Springfield, among others.

* The Section (Los Angeles, 1960s–1970s)
: A Los Angeles singer/songwriter scene associated with the Troubadour nightclub and Laurel Canyon in the late 1960s to mid-1970s was supported by musicians Russ Kunkel, Danny Kortchmar, Leland Sklar and Craig Doerge. This session combo, nicknamed &quot;the Section&quot; or &quot;the Mafia,&quot; backed many musicians, among others: Carole King, James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, Kris Kristofferson and David Crosby.

* The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (Memphis, 1960s)
: A group comprising Barry Beckett, Roger Hawkins, David Hood, and Jimmy Johnson, also known as the Swampers, became known for the &quot;Muscle Shoals Sound.&quot; Many of the recordings done in the Memphis area, which included Muscle Shoals, Alabama, used The Memphis Horns in their arrangements.

* MFSB (Philadelphia, 1970s)
:MFSB (&quot;Mother Father Sister Brother&quot;) was a group of soul music studio musicians based in Philadelphia at the Sigma Sound Studios; they later went on to become a name-brand instrumental group, and their best-known hit was &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia),&quot; better known as the theme from &quot;Soul Train&quot;.

* The Hillside Singers (1970s)
: A vocal group commissioned to provide vocals for Mayoham Music, formed by husband and wife Al Ham and Mary Mayo (the latter of whom was also a member of the group). The group is best known for their jingles and television news themes. &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony),&quot; originally composed as a jingle for Coca-Cola, became a surprise hit and the source of the group&#x27;s recording name, as the Coca-Cola commercial featured singers on a hillside. The New Seekers would have an even larger hit with the same song.

<text>Theodor Paul Albrecht (; 28 March 1922 – 24 July 2010) was a German entrepreneur. He established the discount supermarket chain Aldi with his brother Karl Albrecht. In 2010, Theo was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 31st richest person in the world, with a net worth of $16.7 billion.

== Business career ==
Albrecht learned the grocery business from his mother, in order to escape the fate of his father in the mines. He and his brother Karl developed Albrecht Diskont, one of Europe&#x27;s largest chains of supermarkets, with the motto &quot;The best quality at the lowest price,&quot; and now known by its acronym, Aldi. &quot;Forbes&quot; has estimated Theo&#x27;s fortune from the supermarket chain as approximately £11 billion. Theo and Karl Albrecht split the Aldi Company they founded in 1960 after a dispute about whether to sell cigarettes. The supermarket divided into two legally separate operating units with two distinct geographical locations. Theo&#x27;s Aldi Nord set to operate in the north of Germany, while Karl&#x27;s Aldi Süd set to operate in Germany&#x27;s south. Theo retired from daily operations in 1993 and remained as chairman of the board.

== Kidnapping ==
In 1971, Albrecht was kidnapped. A ransom of seven million German marks (approximately US$2 million at the time) was paid for his release. He was held at gunpoint by Heinz-Joachim Ollenburg, a lawyer, and his accomplice Paul Kron. The ransom sum was delivered by Franz Hengsbach, then Bishop of Essen. His kidnappers were eventually caught by authorities, but only half of the money was recovered. Albrecht later unsuccessfully claimed the ransom as a tax deductible business expense in court.

== Personal life ==
Albrecht was raised in a Catholic household. In 1940, at the age of 18, Theo was conscripted into the German Army and served in the North African campaign. Theo was captured by Americans in Tunisia. In 1946 he returned to Germany.

Albrecht&#x27;s kidnapping in 1971 partially explained his and the family&#x27;s decision to largely withdraw from public life. As a result, little is known about them. The kidnapping caused him to drive to work in an armored car, using a different route every day. The Albrecht family members are known to be very reclusive and have been described by &quot;Forbes&quot; as &#x27;more reclusive than the yeti&#x27;. Theo was rarely pictured by photographers, and he never made a public statement. The last published photo of Theo Albrecht dates from 1971, one day after his kidnapping. Another photo of the two Albrecht brothers together was taken in 1987 by journalist Franz Ruch.

Albrecht and his brother Karl were once said to own an island located in the North Sea, where they indulged their hobbies such as golf and pastimes, including the collecting of antique typewriters. Theo had, as do members of the Albrecht family now, a highly secure estate overlooking the Ruhr valley. Obsessed with frugality, Theo is said to have collected and used pencil stubs frequently. He was also known to wear cheap, poorly fitting suits, and preferred plain meals with many potatoes. When he was asked to approve the plans for a new store in the Netherlands, he stated that the design was good, but the paper it was drawn on was too thick: &quot;If you use thinner paper, we will save money.&quot;

Albrecht died 24 July 2010, in his hometown of Essen.

<text>At the 1996 Summer Olympics, two different gymnastics disciplines were contested: artistic gymnastics and rhythmic gymnastics. The artistic gymnastics events were held at the Georgia Dome from July 20–25 and July 28–29. The rhythmic gymnastics events were held at Stegeman Coliseum in nearby Athens, on the campus of the University of Georgia from August 1–4.

The women&#x27;s rhythmic group all-around was contested for the first time at these Games. This marked the second time that a women&#x27;s only sport was introduced to the Games.
==Artistic gymnastics==

===Format of competition===
The gymnastics competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics was carried out in three stages:

*Competition I - The team competition/qualification round in which gymnasts, including those who were not part of a team, performed both compulsory and optional exercises. Six of the seven team members performed on each apparatus, while only the five highest scores during each rotation were used to determine the overall team total. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts in the all-around qualified to the individual all-around competition. The eight highest-scoring gymnasts on each apparatus qualified to the final for that apparatus.
*Competition II - The individual all-around competition, in which those who qualified from Competition I performed exercises on each apparatus. The final score of each gymnast was determined by adding the scores earned by him or her on each of the six apparatuses in the men&#x27;s competition and each of the four apparatuses in the women&#x27;s competition.
*Competition III - The apparatus finals, in which those who qualified during Competition I performed an exercise on the individual apparatus on which he or she had qualified. The final score of each gymnast determined by the score earned by him or her on the apparatus during this competition.

Each country was limited to three gymnasts in the all-around final and two gymnasts in each apparatus final.
