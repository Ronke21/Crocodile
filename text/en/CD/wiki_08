<text>The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation (Montana Salish: Séliš u Ql̓ispé, Kutenai: k̓upawiȼq̓nuk) are a federally recognized tribe in the U.S. state of Montana. The government includes members of several Bitterroot Salish, Kootenai and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles tribes and is centered on the Flathead Indian Reservation.

The peoples of this area were named Flathead Indians by Europeans who came to the area. The name was originally applied to various Salish peoples, based on the practice of artificial cranial deformation by some of the groups, though the modern groups associated with the Flathead Reservation never engaged in it.

== Early days of the Salish ==
The Salish (Flatheads) initially lived entirely east of the Continental Divide but established their headquarters near the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Occasionally, hunting parties went west of the Continental Divide but not west of the Bitterroot Range. The easternmost edge of their ancestral hunting forays were the Gallatin Range, Crazy Mountain, and Little Belt Ranges.

=== Early territory ===
The Flathead and the Pend d&#x27;Oreille both agree that the Flathead once occupied a large territory on the plains east of the Rocky Mountains. This tribal homeland included the present-day counties of Broadwater, Jefferson, Deer Lodge, Silver Bow, Madison and Gallatin and parts of Lewis &amp; Clark, Meagher and Park. This was about the time when they got the first horses.

The tribe consisted of at least four bands. Respectively, they had winter quarters near present-day Helena, near Butte, east of Butte and in the Big Hole Valley.

===Nearby peoples===
The Salis-Tunaxe lived immediately to the north of the Flathead. There was no sharp line between the two tribal territories, and the people in the border zone often intermarried. Further north lived the Kutenai-Tunaxe (Kootenai-Tunaxe). To the east of them lived the Salisan tribes&#x27; common enemy, the Blackfoot. West of the Rocky Mountains held the Pend d&#x27;Oreille the territory around Flathead Lake, and south of them occupied the Semteuse a relatively small area. The numerous Shoshone semi-surrounded the Salish from northeast to southwest. It seems the Salish did not know the Comanche and Kiowa at this time. They may have been regarded as bands of Shoshone.

Later well-established plains tribes like the Sarsi, Assiniboine, Cree, Crow, Gros Ventre, Arapaho, Cheyenne and Sioux lived far away. They were unknown to the Salish.

=== Horses and the changed life of the Salish ===
The Salish got horses from the Shoshone, and the animal changed the life of the people. When they had had only dogs, the Salish had paid no special attention to the American bison, which they had hunted just like deer and elk. Newly acquired mounts made it possible to overtake the American bison and the secured meat and skins could easily be carried by packhorses. All other game lost in importance.

Before they had had horses, the Salish had lived in conical tents covered with two to four layers of sewed tule mats, depending on the season. The tipi soon replaced the old lodge. Instead of rawhide bags of many shapes and sizes, the women made parfleches from now on.

=== Forced west of the divide ===
Both the Salish-Tunaxe and the Semteuse were almost &quot;killed off in wars&quot; with the Blackfoot and further reduced by smallpox. Some of the survivors took refuge among the Salish. With the near extinction of the Salish-Tunaxe, the Salish extended their hunting grounds northward to Sun River. Between 1700 and 1750, they were driven back by pedestrian Blackfoot warriors armed with fire weapons. Finally, they were forced out of the bison range and west of the divide along with the Kutenai-Tunaxe.

== History ==
The Flatheads lived now between the Cascade Range and Rocky Mountains. The first written record of the tribes is either from their meeting with trapper Andrew Garcia, explorer David Thompson, or the Lewis and Clark Expedition (September 4, 1805). Lewis and Clark came there and asked for horses but eventually ate the horses due to starvation. The Flatheads also appear in the records of the Roman Catholic Church at St. Louis, Missouri, to which they sent four delegations to request missionaries (or &quot;Black Robes&quot;) to minister to the tribe. Their request was finally granted, and a number of missionaries, including Pierre-Jean De Smet, were eventually sent. The Flatheads are also located in Sula, Montana.

The tribes negotiated the Hellgate treaty with the United States in 1855. From the start, treaty negotiations were plagued by serious translation problems. A Jesuit observer, Adrian Hoecken, said that the translations were so poor that &quot;not a tenth of what was said was understood by either side.&quot; But as in the meeting with Lewis and Clark, the pervasive cross-cultural miscommunication ran even deeper than problems of language and translation. Tribal people came to the meeting assuming they were going to formalize an already-recognized friendship. Non-Indians came with the goal of making official their claims to native lands and resources. Isaac Stevens, the new governor and superintendent of Indian affairs for the Washington Territory, was intent on obtaining cession of the Bitterroot Valley from the Salish. Many non-Indians were already well aware of the valley&#x27;s potential value for agriculture and its relatively temperate climate in winter. Because of the resistance of Chief Victor (Many Horses), Stevens ended up inserting into the treaty complicated (and doubtless poorly translated) language that defined the Bitterroot Valley south of Lolo Creek as a &quot;conditional reservation&quot; for the Salish. Victor put his X mark on the document, convinced that the agreement would not require his people to leave their homeland. No other word came from the government for the next fifteen years, so the Salish assumed that they would indeed stay in their Bitterroot Valley forever.

After the 1864 gold rush in the newly established Montana Territory, pressure upon the Salish intensified from both illegal non-Indian squatters and government officials. In 1870, Victor died, and he was succeeded as chief by his son, Chief Charlot (aka Charlo, Claw of the Little Grizzly). Like his father, Charlot adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. He insisted on the right of his people to remain in the Bitterroot Valley. But territorial citizens and officials thought the new chief could be pressured into capitulating. In 1871, they successfully lobbied President Ulysses S. Grant to declare that the survey required by the treaty had been conducted and that it had found that the Jocko (Flathead) Reservation was better suited to the needs of the Salish. On the basis of Grant&#x27;s executive order, Congress sent a delegation, led by future president James Garfield, to make arrangements with the tribe for their removal. Charlot ignored their demands and even their threats of bloodshed, and he again refused to sign any agreement to leave. U.S. officials then simply forged Charlot&#x27;s &quot;X&quot; onto the official copy of the agreement that was sent to the Senate for ratification.

Over time, the real reason for the Hellgate treaty meetings became clear to the Salish and Pend d&#x27;Oreille people. Under the terms spelled out in the written document, the tribes ceded to the United States more than twenty million acres (81,000 km2) of land and reserved from cession about 1.3 million acres (5300 km2), thus forming the Jocko or Flathead Indian Reservation. Conditions had become intolerable for the Salish by the late 1880s, after the Missoula and Bitter Root Valley Railroad was constructed directly through the tribe&#x27;s lands, with neither permission from the native owners nor payment to them. Charlot finally signed an agreement to leave the Bitterroot Valley in November 1889. Inaction by Congress, however, delayed the removal for another two years, and according to some observers, the tribe&#x27;s desperation reached a level of outright starvation. In October 1891, a contingent of troops from Fort Missoula forced Charlot and the Salish out of the Bitterroot and roughly marched the small band sixty miles to the Flathead Reservation.

The three main tribes moved to the Flathead Reservation were the Bitterroot Salish, the Pend d&#x27;Oreille, and the Kootenai. The Bitterroot Salish and the Pend d&#x27;Oreille tribes spoke dialects of the same Salish language.

A dispute over off-reservation hunting between a band of Pend d&#x27;Oreilles and the state of Montana&#x27;s Fish and Game department resulted in the Swan Valley Massacre of 1908.

Though marked for termination in 1953 under the House concurrent resolution 108 of the US federal Indian termination policy, the Flathead Tribes were able to resist the government&#x27;s plans to terminate their tribal relationship in Congressional hearings in 1954.
In 2021 the Bison were returned to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes

== Demographics ==
The tribe has about 6800 members with approximately 4,000 tribal members living on the Flathead Reservation as of 2013, and 2,800 tribal members living off the reservation. Their predominant religion is Roman Catholicism. 1,100 Native Americans from other tribes and more than 10,000 non-Native Americans also live on the reservation.

== Politics ==
As the first to organize a tribal government under the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, the tribes are governed by a tribal council. The Tribal Council has ten members, and the council elects from within a chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer. The tribal government offers a number of services to tribal members and is the chief employer on the reservation. The tribes operate a tribal college, the Salish Kootenai College, and a heritage museum called &quot;The People&#x27;s Center&quot; in Pablo, seat of the tribal government.

== Economy ==
The tribes are the biggest employer on the reservation. In 2011, they provided 65% of all jobs.
The tribes own and jointly operate a valuable hydropower dam, called Séliš Ksanka Ql&#x27;ispé Dam (formerly known as Kerr Dam). They are the first Indian nation in the United States to own a hydroelectric dam. CSKT also operates the only local electricity provider Mission Valley Power, as well as S&amp;K Electronics (founded 1984), and the internationally operating S&amp;K Technologies (founded 1999). Other tribal businesses are the &quot;KwaTaqNuk Resort &amp; Casino&quot; in Polson (county seat of Lake County and most populous community on the reservation) and &quot;Gray Wolf Peak Casino&quot; in Evaro, Montana.

==Geography==

===Aboriginal lands===
The peoples of these tribes originally lived in the areas of Montana, parts of Idaho, British Columbia (Canada) and Wyoming. The original territory comprised about 22 million acres (89,000 km2) at the time of the 1855 Hellgate treaty.

===Reservation lands===
The Flathead Reservation in northwest Montana is over 1.3 million acres (5,300 km2) in size.

The Tribal Council represents eight districts:
*Arlee District 
*Sčilíp District
*Elmo District
*Hot Springs District
*Pablo District
*Polson District
*Ronan District
*St. Ignatius District
During World War II, a Liberty Ship, the SS &quot;Chief Charlot&quot;, was named in his honor and built in Richmond, California, in 1943.

<text>John Patton (January 6, 1823 – December 23, 1897) was a U.S. Representative from the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. He was the father of Charles Emory Patton, also a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania (1911–1915), Alexander Ennis Patton, Pennsylvania State Senator, John Patton Jr., a U.S. Senator from Michigan (1894–1895), and the uncle of William Irvin Swoope, also a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania (1923–1927).

Patton was born in Covington Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania and moved to Curwensville, Pennsylvania in 1828. He attended the public schools and engaged in mercantile pursuits and lumbering 1844-1860.

He organized the First National Bank of Curwensville in 1864 and was elected its president. He then organized the Curwensville Bank, and was elected its president.

He was a delegate to the Whig National Convention in 1852 and to the Republican National Convention in 1860.

Patton was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-seventh Congress, serving from March 4, 1861 to March 3, 1863. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1862. He was again elected to the Fiftieth Congress, serving from March 4, 1887 to March 3, 1889. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1888, after which he resumed banking.

Patton died in Philadelphia, aged 74, where he had gone for medical treatment, and was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery, in Curwensville, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="875547" wikidata="Q4198705" url="?curid=875547" title="Marital rape">
<text>Marital rape or spousal rape is the act of sexual intercourse with one&#x27;s spouse without the spouse&#x27;s consent. The lack of consent is the essential element and doesn&#x27;t always involve physical violence. Marital rape is considered a form of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Although, historically, sexual intercourse within marriage was regarded as a right of spouses, engaging in the act without the spouse&#x27;s consent is now widely classified as rape by many societies around the world, and increasingly criminalized. However it is repudiated by some more conservative cultures.

The issues of sexual and domestic violence within marriage and the family unit, and more specifically, the issue of violence against women, have come to growing international attention from the second half of the 20th century. Still, in many countries, marital rape either remains outside the criminal law, or is illegal but widely tolerated. Laws are rarely enforced, due to factors ranging from reluctance of authorities to pursue the crime, to lack of public knowledge that sexual intercourse in marriage without consent is illegal.

Marital rape is more widely experienced by women, though not exclusively. Marital rape is often a chronic form of violence for the victim which takes place within abusive relations. It exists in a complex web of state governments, cultural practices, and societal ideologies which combine to influence each distinct instance and situation in varying ways. The reluctance to define non-consensual sex between married couples as a crime and to prosecute has been attributed to traditional views of marriage, interpretations of religious doctrines, ideas about male and female sexuality, and to cultural expectations of subordination of a wife to her husband — views which continue to be common in many parts of the world. These views of marriage and sexuality started to be challenged in most Western countries from the 1960s and 70s especially by second-wave feminism, leading to an acknowledgment of the woman&#x27;s right to self-determination of all matters relating to her body, and the withdrawal of the exemption or defence of marital rape.

Most countries criminalized marital rape from the late 20th century onward — very few legal systems allowed for the prosecution of rape within marriage before the 1970s. Criminalization has occurred through various ways, including removal of statutory exemptions from the definitions of rape, judicial decisions, explicit legislative reference in statutory law preventing the use of marriage as a defence, or creation of a specific offense of marital rape, albeit at a lower level of punishment. In many countries, it is still unclear whether marital rape is covered by the ordinary rape laws, but in some countries non-consensual sexual relations involving coercion may be prosecuted under general statutes prohibiting violence, such as assault and battery laws.

==History==

Historically, in much of the world, rape was seen as a crime or tort of theft of a man&#x27;s property (usually either a husband or father). In this case, property damage meant that the crime was not legally recognized as damage against the victim, but instead to her father or husband&#x27;s property. Therefore, by definition a husband could not rape his wife. The view that a husband cannot be charged with the rape of his wife was described by Sir Matthew Hale (1609–1676) in &quot;History of the Pleas of the Crown&quot;, published posthumously in 1736, where he wrote that &quot;The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract&quot;. Also, American and English law subscribed until the 20th century to the system of coverture, that is, a legal doctrine under which, upon marriage, a woman&#x27;s legal rights were subsumed by those of her husband. The implication was that once unified by marriage, a spouse could no longer be charged with raping one&#x27;s spouse, anymore than be charged with raping oneself.

Many jurisdictions, including all fifty U.S. states, had criminalized marital rape by the 1990s. English common law also had a great impact on many legal systems of the world through colonialism.

Kersti Yllö states in the prologue of &quot;Understanding Marital Rape In a Global Context&quot;, &quot;In some cultures, consent is not even something that an individual wife can give. The families that arranged the marriage guarantee her permanent consent.&quot; Control over a wife&#x27;s sexuality was only a part of the greater control that men had in all other areas concerning her. A husband&#x27;s control over his wife&#x27;s body could also be seen in the way adultery between a wife and another man was constructed; for example in 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt described the act of a man having sexual relations with another man&#x27;s wife as &quot;the highest invasion of property&quot;. For this reason, in many cultures there was a conflation between the crimes of rape and adultery, since both were seen and understood as a violation of the rights of the husband. Spousal rape was considered a property crime against a husband, not against a woman&#x27;s right to self-determination.

The property to be withheld in a female was her virginity; this was the commodity. Following this line of logic, a woman was (and still is in many cultures across the globe) first the property of her father, then, upon marriage, the property of her husband. Therefore, a man could not be prosecuted for raping his own wife because she was his possession. However, if another man raped someone&#x27;s wife, this was essentially stealing property (a women&#x27;s sexuality). In English customs, &quot;bride capture&quot; (a man claiming a woman through rape) was thought to be stealing a father&#x27;s property by raping his daughter. Therefore, rape laws were created to &quot;protect the property interests men had in their women, not to protect women themselves&quot;.

In some cultures, marriage is arranged for the purpose of creating access to procreation. In these situations, the parties do not necessarily consent to marriage (in the case of forced marriage). Following this logic, if consent is not part of marriage, then it is not necessary for intercourse. The autonomy of the wife is also often compromised in cultures where bride price is paid. Under customary law in certain parts of Africa, forced sex in marriage was not prohibited, although some specific circumstances, such as during advanced pregnancy, immediately after childbirth, during menstruation, or during mourning for a deceased close relative, were recognized as giving the wife the right to refuse sex.

Rape has been, until recent decades, understood as a crime against honor and reputationnot only in domestic legislation, but also in international law; for example according to the Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, &quot;Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault&quot;. It was not until the 1990s that the International Criminal Court statute recognized crimes of sexual violence as violent crimes against the person; &quot;Not until the last half century was rape understood to be an offense against the woman, against her dignity, instead of against her family&#x27;s or her husband&#x27;s honor&quot;.

==Legal aspect==
Historically, many cultures have had a concept of spouses&#x27; conjugal rights to sexual intercourse with each other. This can be seen in English common law, in force in Anglo America and the British Commonwealth, where the very concept of marital rape was treated as an impossibility. This was illustrated most vividly by Sir Matthew Hale (1609–1676), in his legal treatise &quot;Historia Placitorum Coronæ&quot; or &quot;History of the Pleas of the Crown&quot; (posthumously, 1736) where he wrote that &quot;The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.&quot;

===Formalization of the marital rape exemption in law===

====Common law and the United Kingdom====
Sir Matthew Hale&#x27;s statement in &quot;History of the Pleas of the Crown&quot; did not cite a legal precedent for it, though it relied on earlier standards. In a case of Lord Audley&#x27;s (1593–1631), for instance, Hale cite&#x27;s the jurist Bracton (c. 1210c. 1268) support of this rule, said to have derived from laws of King Æthelstan (r. 927–939) where upon the law holds that even &quot;were the party of no chaste life, but a whore, yet there may be ravishment: but it is a good plea to say she was his concubine&quot;. A lawful marriage legitimizes the conjugal act itself, so &quot;marital rape&quot; is a contradiction in terms. While a physical assault against a spouse may be charged, such is distinct from the delegitimization of conjugal union itself as rape. Marriage then should not be defined as an &quot;exemption&quot; to rape but as &quot;contradictory&quot; to it. Marriage created conjugal rights between spouses, and marriage could not be annulled except by a private act of Parliament—it therefore follows that a spouse could not revoke conjugal rights from the marriage, and therefore there could be no rape between spouses. The principle was repeated in East&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown&quot; in 1803 and in Archbold&#x27;s &quot;Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases&quot; in 1822. The principle was framed as an exemption to the law of rape in an English courtroom in &quot;R v Clarence&quot;, but it was not overturned until 1991 by the House of Lords in the case of &quot;R v R&quot; in 1991, where it was described as an anachronistic and offensive legal fiction.

===Feminist critique in the 19th century===
From the beginnings of the 19th century feminist movement, activists challenged the presumed right of men to engage in forced or coerced sex with their wives. In the United States, &quot;the nineteenth-century woman&#x27;s rights movement fought against a husband&#x27;s right to control marital intercourse in a campaign that was remarkably developed, prolific, and insistent, given nineteenth-century taboos against the public mention of sex or sexuality.&quot; Suffragists including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucy Stone &quot;singled out a woman&#x27;s right to control marital intercourse as the core component of equality.&quot;

Nineteenth century feminist demands centered on the right of women to control their bodies and fertility, positioned consent in marital sexual relations as an alternative to contraception and abortion (which many opposed), and also embraced eugenic concerns about excessive procreation. British liberal feminists John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor attacked marital rape as a gross double standard in law and as central to the subordination of women.

Advocates of the Free Love Movement, including early anarcha-feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman, as well as Victoria Woodhull, Thomas Low Nichols, and Mary Gove Nichols, joined a critique of marital rape to advocate women&#x27;s autonomy and sexual pleasure. Moses Harman, a Kansas-based publisher and advocate for women&#x27;s rights, was jailed twice under the Comstock laws for publishing articles (by a woman who was victimized and a doctor who treated marital rape survivors) decrying marital rape. De Cleyre defended Harman in a well-known article, &quot;Sexual Slavery.&quot; She refused to draw any distinction between rape outside of and within marriage: &quot;And that is rape, where a man forces himself sexually upon a woman whether he is licensed by the marriage law to do it or not.&quot;

British philosopher and writer Bertrand Russell in his book &quot;Marriage and Morals&quot; (1929) deplored the situation of married women. He wrote &quot;Marriage is for woman the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution.&quot;

===20th- and 21st-century criminalization===
The marital rape exemption or defence became more widely viewed as inconsistent with the developing concepts of human rights and equality. The first country which criminalized the marital rape in 1922 was Soviet Union (i. e. the penal code made no longer the distinction between violent sex within marriage and outside the marriage), one decade later Poland in 1932. After World War II, many members of the Communist Bloc followed the Soviet example, e. g. Czechoslovakia in 1950. 

Under the influence of European countries in which marital rape was already illegal (Soviet Union, etc.), feminists in other countries worked systematically since the 1960s to overturn the marital rape exemption and criminalize marital rape. Increasing criminalization of spousal rape is part of a worldwide reclassification of sexual crimes &quot;from offenses against morality, the family, good customs, honor, or chastity ... to offenses against liberty, self-determination, or physical integrity.&quot; In December 1993, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights published the &quot;Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women&quot;. This establishes marital rape as a human rights violation.

The importance of the right to self sexual determination of women is increasingly being recognized as crucial to women&#x27;s rights. In 2012, High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that:

:&quot;Violations of women&#x27;s human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. (...) In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception. (...) Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues—such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children—are at the heart of living a life in dignity.&quot;

Despite these trends and international moves, criminalization has not occurred in all UN member States. Determining the criminal status of marital rape may be challenging, because, while some countries &quot;explicitly criminalize&quot; the act (by stipulating in their rape laws that marriage is not a defense to a charge of rape; or by creating a specific crime of &#x27;marital rape&#x27;; or, otherwise, by having statutory provisions that expressly state that a spouse can be charged with the rape of their other spouse) and other countries &quot;explicitly exempt&quot; spouses (by defining rape as forced sexual intercourse outside of marriage; or forced sexual intercourse with a woman not the perpetrator&#x27;s wife; or by providing in their rape provisions that marriage is a defense to a charge of rape), in many countries the ordinary rape laws are silent on the issue (that is, they do not address the issue one way or another)—in such cases, in order to determine whether marital rape is covered by the ordinary rape laws it must be analyzed whether there are judicial decisions in this respect; and former definitions of the law are also important (for instance whether there was previously a statutory exemption that was removed by legislators for the purpose of implicitly including marital rape).

In 2006, the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s in-depth study on all forms of violence against women stated that:

:&quot;Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 States. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offence in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted.&quot;

In 2011, the UN Women report Progress of the World&#x27;s Women:In Pursuit of Justice stated that:
:&quot;By April 2011, at least 52 States had explicitly outlawed marital rape in their criminal code&quot;.

Traditionally, rape was a criminal offense that could only be committed outside marriage, and courts did not apply the rape statutes to acts of forced sex between spouses. With changing social views, and international condemnation of sexual violence in marriage, courts have started to apply the rape laws in marriage. The current applicability in many countries of rape laws to spouses is currently unclear, since in many countries the laws have not been recently tested in court. In some countries, notably jurisdictions which have inherited the 1860 Indian Penal Code (such as Singapore, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma) and some countries in the Commonwealth Caribbean region, the laws explicitly exempt spouses from prosecution (for instance, under the 1860 Indian Penal Code, which has also been inherited by other countries in the region, the law on rape states that &quot;Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife is not rape&quot;).

An example of a country where the rape law &quot;explicitly excludes&quot; a husband as a possible perpetrator is Ethiopia; its rape law states: &quot;Article 620Rape: Whoever compels a woman to submit to sexual intercourse &quot;outside wedlock&quot;, whether by the use of violence or grave intimidation, or after having rendered her unconscious or incapable of resistance, is punishable with rigorous imprisonment from five years to fifteen years&quot;. Another example is South Sudan, where the law states: &quot;Sexual intercourse by a married couple is not rape, within the meaning of this section&quot;. (Art 247). Conversely, an example of country where the rape law &quot;explicitly criminalizes&quot; marital rape is NamibiaThe Combating of Rape Act (No. 8 of 2000) states that: &quot;No marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defence to a charge of rape under this Act&quot;. An example of a jurisdiction where marital rape is a &quot;distinct&quot; criminal offense is Bhutan where &#x27;Marital rape&#x27; is defined by Article 199 which reads: &quot;A defendant shall be guilty of marital rape, if the defendant engages in sexual intercourse with one&#x27;s own spouse without consent or against the will of the other spouse&quot;.

By 1986, in Europe, there was international pressure to criminalize marital rape: the &quot;European Parliament&#x27;s Resolution on Violence Against Women of 1986&quot; called for its criminalization. This was reiterated by the Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence. (see para 35) This recommendation provided detailed guidelines on how legislation regarding domestic violence, rape, and other forms of violence against women should operate. It also provided a definition of violence against women, and gave a list of non-exhaustive examples, including marital rape (see section &quot;Definition&quot; para 1). Although the approach on the issue of violence against women has varied significantly among European countries, the traditional view that acts of violence against a woman are crimes against honor and morality, and not against the self-determination of the woman, was still prevalent in the 1990s in many countries. The above recommendation stated that member states must &quot;ensure that criminal law provides that any act of violence against a person, in particular physical or sexual violence, constitutes a violation of that person&#x27;s physical, psychological and/or sexual freedom and integrity, and not solely a violation of morality, honour or decency&quot; (para 34). The approach regarding sexual and other forms of violence against women in specific European countries did not necessarily mirror women&#x27;s rights in other areas of life (such as public or political life) in those countries: in fact some countries otherwise known for advanced women&#x27;s rights, such as Finland and Denmark, have received strong criticism for their policies in this area. A 2008 report produced by Amnesty International, described Danish laws on sexual violence as &quot;inconsistent with international human rights standards&quot;, which has led to Denmark eventually reforming its sexual offenses legislation in 2013. (Until 2013, in Denmark &quot;the Penal Code reduce[d] the level of penalty or provide[d] for exclusion of punishment altogether for rape and sexual violence within marriage in certain instances [...] and if the perpetrator enter[ed] into or continu[ed] a marriage with his victim the punishment for rape c[ould] be reduced or remitted&quot;). Cultural and religious values which support female subordination and inequality are considered important in dealing with the issue of sexual violence against women; but there have been calls for analyses of cultural gender norms which tolerate violence against women to not be based on stereotypes; Mala Htun and S. Laurel Weldon write &quot;gender policy is not one issue but many&quot; and &quot;When [...] Latin American countries are quicker to adopt policies addressing violence against women than the Nordic countries, one at least ought to consider the possibility that fresh ways of grouping states would further the study of gender politics.&quot; The causes of the tolerationin law or in practiceof sexual violence inside marriage are complex; lack of understanding of the concept of consent and coercion due to lack of sexual education and public discussion about sexuality are often cited as causes of sexual abuse in general; but there has been criticism towards the idea that sex education about consent, in and of itself, is sufficient.

The countries which choose to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women, are bound by its provisions to ensure that non-consensual sexual acts committed against a spouse or partner are illegal. The convention came into force in August 2014. In its explanatory report (para 219) it acknowledges the long tradition of toleration, &quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot;, of marital rape and domestic violence:

:&quot;A large number of the offences established in accordance with this Convention are offences typically committed by family members, intimate partners or others in the immediate social environment of the victim. There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator.&quot;

====Legal changes====
Countries which were early to criminalize marital rape include the Soviet Union (1922), Poland (1932), Czechoslovakia (1950), some other members of the Communist Bloc, Sweden (1965), and Norway (1971). Slovenia, then a republic within federal Yugoslavia, criminalized marital rape in 1977. The Israeli Supreme Court affirmed that marital rape is a crime in a 1980 decision, citing law based on the Talmud (at least 6th century). Criminalization in Australia began with the state of New South Wales in 1981, followed by all other states from 1985 to 1992. Several formerly British-ruled countries followed suit: Canada (1983), New Zealand (1985), and Ireland (1990).

Marital rape was criminalized in Austria in 1989 (and in 2004 it became a state offense meaning it can be prosecuted by the state even in the absence of a complaint from the spouse, with procedures being similar to stranger rape). In Switzerland marital rape became a crime in 1992 (and became a state offense in 2004). In Spain, the Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that sex within marriage must be consensual and that sexuality in marriage must be understood in light of the principle of the freedom to make one&#x27;s own decisions with respect to sexual activity; in doing so it upheld the conviction of a man who had been found guilty of raping his wife by a lower court.

In Europe, Finland outlawed marital rape in 1994. The case of domestic violence in Finland has been the subject of interest and discussion, because Finland is otherwise considered a country where women have very advanced rights in regard to &quot;public&quot; life and participation in the public sphere (jobs, opportunities, etc.). The country has been made the object of international criticism in regard to its approach towards violence against women. A 2010 Eurobarometer survey on European attitudes on violence against women showed that victim blaming attitudes are much more common in Finland than in other countries: 74% of Finns blamed &quot;the provocative behaviour of women&quot; for violence against women, much higher than in other countries (for instance many countries that are popularly believed to be among the most patriarchal of Europe were significantly less likely to agree with that assertion: 33% in Spain, 46% in Ireland, 47% in Italy).

Belgium was early to criminalize marital rape. In 1979, the Brussels Court of Appeal recognized marital rape and found that a husband who used serious violence to coerce his wife into having sex against her wishes was guilty of the criminal offense of rape. The logic of the court was that, although the husband did have a &#x27;right&#x27; to sex with his wife, he could not use violence to claim it, as Belgian laws did not allow people to obtain their rights by violence. In 1989 laws were amended, the definition of rape was broadened, and marital rape began to be treated the same as other forms of rape.

In Ireland, the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981 defined rape as &quot;unlawful sexual intercourse&quot; without consent; an attempt to explicitly include spouses within the definition was rejected by the Fianna Fáil government. Seán Doherty, the Minister for Justice, suggested that the courts might allow a charge of rape in some cases, and that various assault charges might be prosecuted in others. A 1987 discussion paper by the Law Reform Commission stated, &quot;In the absence of Irish decisions on the topic, the present law cannot be stated with any great degree of confidence. It would appear, however, that to the extent that the marital rape exemption exists, it is confined to circumstances where the spouses are cohabiting and there are no separation proceedings in being, or even, perhaps, in contemplation.&quot; The paper&#x27;s call to abolish any marital exemption was &quot;on the whole, generally welcomed, although some misgivings were expressed as to whether it might not lead to fabricated complaints and unwarranted intrusions in the marital relationship.&quot; The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 removed the word &quot;unlawful&quot; from the 1981 definition of rape, and abolished &quot;any rule of law by virtue of which a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife&quot;. The first two convictions were in 2006 (upon retrial) and 2016.

In France, in 1990, following a case where a man had tortured and raped his wife, the Court of Cassation authorized prosecution of spouses for rape or sexual assault. In 1992 the Court convicted a man of the rape of his wife, stating that the presumption that spouses have consented to sexual acts that occur within marriage is only valid when the contrary is not proven. In 1994, Law 94-89 criminalized marital rape; a second law, passed 4 April 2006, makes rape by a partner (including in unmarried relationships, marriages, and civil unions) an aggravating circumstance in prosecuting rape.

Germany outlawed spousal rape in 1997, which is later than other developed countries. Female ministers and women&#x27;s rights activists lobbied for this law for over 25 years. Before 1997, the definition of rape was: &quot;Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years’ imprisonment&quot;. In 1997 there were changes to the rape law, broadening the definition, making it gender-neutral, and removing the marital exemption. Before, marital rape could only be prosecuted as &quot;Causing bodily harm&quot; (Section 223 of the German Criminal Code), &quot;Insult&quot; (Section 185 of the German Criminal Code) and &quot;Using threats or force to cause a person to do, suffer or omit an act&quot; (Nötigung, Section 240 of the German Criminal Code) which carried lower sentences and were rarely prosecuted.

Before a new Criminal Code came into force in 2003, the law on rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina also contained a statutory exemption, and read: &quot;Whoever coerces a female not his wife into sexual intercourse by force or threat of imminent attack upon her life or body or the life or body of a person close to her, shall be sentenced to a prison term of one to ten years&quot;. In Portugal also, before 1982, there was a statutory exemption.

Marital rape was criminalized in Serbia in 2002; before that date rape was legally defined as forced sexual intercourse outside of marriage. The same was true in Hungary until 1997.

In 1994, in Judgment no. 223/94 V, 1994, the Court of Appeal of Luxembourg confirmed the applicability of the provisions of the Criminal Code regarding rape to marital rape.

Marital rape was made illegal in the Netherlands in 1991. The legislative changes provided a new definition for rape in 1991, which removed the marital exemption, and also made the crime gender-neutral; before 1991 the legal definition of rape was a man forcing, by violence or threat of thereof, a woman to engage in sexual intercourse outside of marriage.

In Italy the law on rape, &quot;violenza carnale&quot; (&#x27;carnal violence&#x27;, as it was termed) did not contain a statutory exemption, but was, as elsewhere, understood as inapplicable in the context of marriage. Although Italy has a reputation of a male dominated traditional society, it was quite early to accept that the rape law covers forced sex in marriage too: in 1976 in &quot;Sentenza n. 12857 del 1976&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that &quot;the spouse who compels the other spouse to carnal knowledge by violence or threats commits the crime of carnal violence&quot; (&quot;commette il delitto di violenza carnale il coniuge che costringa con violenza o minaccia l’altro coniuge a congiunzione carnale&quot;).

Cyprus criminalized marital rape in 1994. Marital rape was made illegal in North Macedonia in 1996. In Croatia marital rape was criminalized in 1998.

In 2006, Greece enacted &quot;Law 3500/2006&quot;, entitled &quot;For combating domestic violence&quot;, which punishes marital rape. It entered into force on 24 October 2006. This legislation also prohibits numerous other forms of violence within marriage and cohabiting relations, and various other forms of abuse of women.

Liechtenstein made marital rape illegal in 2001.

In South America, Colombia criminalized marital rape in 1996, and Chile criminalized it in 1999.

Thailand outlawed marital rape in 2007. The new reforms were enacted amid strong controversy and were opposed by many. One opponent of the law was legal scholar Taweekiet Meenakanit who voiced his opposition to the legal reforms. He also opposed the making of rape a gender neutral offense. Meenakanit claimed that allowing a husband to file a rape charge against his wife is &quot;abnormal logic&quot; and that wives would refuse to divorce or put their husband in jail since many Thai wives are dependent on their husbands.

Papua New Guinea criminalized marital rape in 2003. Namibia outlawed marital rape in 2000.

Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) considers the forced sex in marriages as a crime only when the wife is below age 15. Thus, marital rape is not a criminal offense under the IPC. Marital rape victims have to take recourse to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 (PWDVA). The PWDVA, which came into force in 2006, outlaws marital rape. However, it offers only a civil remedy for the offence. In February 2022, Smriti Irani (Minister for Women and Child Development) told parliament that “The Government of India has initiated the process for comprehensive amendments to criminal laws in consultation&quot; in response to questions on marital rape, which assures some provisions will be made on criminalizing marital rape.

Recent countries to criminalize marital rape include Zimbabwe (2001), Turkey (2005), Cambodia (2005), Liberia (2006), Nepal (2006),
Mauritius (2007), Ghana (2007), Malaysia (2007), Thailand (2007), Rwanda (2009), Suriname (2009), Nicaragua (2012), Sierra Leone (2012), South Korea (2013), Bolivia (2013), Samoa (2013), Tonga (1999/2013). Human rights observers have criticized a variety of countries for failing to effectively prosecute marital rape once it has been criminalized. South Africa, which criminalized in 1993, saw its first conviction for marital rape in 2012.

====United States====

The traditional definition of rape in the United States is the forced sexual intercourse by a male with a &quot;female &quot;not his wife&quot;&quot;, making it clear that the statutes did not apply to married couples. The 1962 Model Penal Code repeated the marital rape exemption, stating: 
:A male who has sexual intercourse with a &quot;female not his wife&quot; is guilty of rape if: ...

Reforms of marital rape laws in the United States began in the mid-1970s with the criminalization of marital rape. South Dakota criminalized marital rape in 1975, making it the first U.S. state to do so. Two years later, however, the South Dakota legislature decriminalized marital rape. After this change, marital rape would not be recriminalized in South Dakota until 1990.

The earlier laws of the 1970s often required the husband and wife to no longer be living together for marital rape charges to be brought. The case in the United States that first challenged this cohabitation clause was &quot;Oregon v. Rideout&quot; in 1978. Although the husband was acquitted of raping his wife, it spurred the movement towards reform. By 1993 marital rape was a crime in all 50 states. Still, in the 1990s, most states continued to differentiate between the way marital rape and non-marital rape was viewed and treated. The laws have continued to change and evolve, with most states reforming their laws in the 21st century. But there are still states, like South Carolina, where marital and non-marital rape are treated quite differently under the law.

In the 1990s, most states differentiated between the way marital rape and non-marital rape were treated. These differences were visible through shorter penalties, taking into account whether or not violence was used, and allowing for shorter reporting periods. (Bergen, 1996; Russell, 1990). 
The laws have continued to change and evolve, with most states reforming their legislation in the 21st century, in order to bring marital rape laws in line with non-marital rape, but even today there remain differences in some states. With the removal, in 2005, of the requirement of a higher level of violence from the law of Tennessee, which now allows for marital rape in Tennessee to be treated like any other type of rape, South Carolina remains the only US state with a law requiring excessive force/violence (the force or violence used or threatened must be of a &quot;high and aggravated nature&quot;).

In most states the criminalization has occurred by the removal of the exemptions from the general rape law by legislation, or by courts striking down such exemptions as unconstitutional. Some states have created a distinct crime of spousal rape. California, for example, has separate criminal offenses for rape (Article 261) and for spousal rape (Article 262).

====England and Wales====
=====Background=====
Although the issue of marital rape was highlighted by feminists in the 19th century, and was also deplored by thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell (see above section &#x27;Feminist critique in the 19th century&#x27;), it was not until the 1970s that this issue was raised at a political level. The late 1970s also saw the enactment of Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, which provided the first statutory definition of rape (prior to this rape was defined by the common law). The Criminal Law Revision Committee in their 1984 Report on Sexual Offences rejected the idea that the offense of rape should be extended to marital relations; writing the following:
:&quot;The majority of us ... believe that rape cannot be considered in the abstract as merely &#x27;sexual intercourse without consent&#x27;. The circumstances of rape may be peculiarly grave. This feature is not present in the case of a husband and wife cohabiting with each other when an act of sexual intercourse occurs without the wife&#x27;s consent. They may well have had sexual intercourse regularly before the act in question and, because a sexual relationship may involve a degree of compromise, she may sometimes have agreed only with some reluctance to such intercourse. Should he go further and force her to have sexual intercourse without her consent, this may evidence a failure of the marital relationship. But it is far from being the &#x27;unique&#x27; and &#x27;grave&#x27; offence described earlier. Where the husband goes so far as to cause injury, there are available a number of offences against the person with which he may be charged, but the gravamen of the husband&#x27;s conduct is the injury he has caused not the sexual intercourse he has forced.&quot;
The committee also expressed more general views on domestic violence arguing that &quot;Violence occurs in some marriages but the wives do not always wish the marital tie to be severed&quot; and reiterated the point that domestic incidents without physical injury would generally be outside the scope of the law: &quot;Some of us consider that the criminal law should keep out of marital relationships between cohabiting partners—especially the marriage bed—except where injury arises, when there are other offences which can be charged.&quot;
Five years later, in Scotland, the High Court of Justiciary took a different view, abolishing marital immunity, in &quot;S. v. H.M. Advocate&quot;, 1989. The same happened in England and Wales in 1991, in &quot;R v R&quot; (see below). Very soon after this, in Australia, at the end of 1991, in &quot;R v L&quot;, the High Court of Australia ruled the same, ruling that if the common law exemption had ever been part of the Australian law, it no longer was (by that time most Australian states and territories had already abolished their exemptions by statutory law).

=====Ending the exemption=====
The marital rape exemption was first referred to in 1736 in Matthew Hale&#x27;s &quot;History of the Pleas of the Crown&quot; (see above). It was abolished in England and Wales in 1991 by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, in the case of &quot;R v R&quot;, which was the first occasion where the marital rights exemption had been appealed as far as the House of Lords, and it followed the trio of cases since 1988 where the marital rights exemption was held to exist. The leading judgment, unanimously approved, was given by Lord Keith of Kinkel. He stated that the contortions being performed in the lower courts in order to avoid applying the marital rights exemption were indicative of the absurdity of the rule, and held, agreeing with earlier judgments in Scotland and in the Court of Appeal in &quot;R v R&quot;, that &quot;the fiction of implied consent has no useful purpose to serve today in the law of rape&quot; and that the marital rights exemption was a &quot;common law fiction&quot; which had never been a true rule of English law. R&#x27;s appeal was accordingly dismissed, and he was convicted of the rape of his wife.
The first attempted prosecution of a husband for the rape of his wife was &quot;R v Clarke&quot; (1949). Rather than try to argue directly against Hale&#x27;s logic, the court held that consent in this instance had been revoked by an order of the court for non-cohabitation. It was the first of a number of cases in which the courts found reasons not to apply the exemption, notably &quot;R v O&#x27;Brien&quot; (1974) (the obtaining of decree nisi), &quot;R v Steele&quot; (1976) (an undertaking by the husband to the court not to molest the wife) and &quot;R v Roberts&quot; (1986) (the existence of a formal separation agreement).
There are at least four recorded instances of a husband successfully relying on the exemption in England and Wales. The first was &quot;R v Miller&quot; (1954), where it was held that the wife had not legally revoked her consent despite having presented a divorce petition. &quot;R v Kowalski&quot; (1988) was followed by &quot;R v Sharples&quot; (1990), and &quot;R v J&quot; (1991), a judgment made after the first instance decision of the Crown Court in &quot;R v R&quot; but before the decision of the House of Lords that was to abolish the exemption. In &quot;Miller&quot;, &quot;Kowalski&quot; and &quot;R v J&quot; the husbands were instead convicted of assault. The &quot;R v Kowalski&quot; case involved, among other acts, an instance of non-consensual oral sex. For this, the husband was convicted of indecent assault, as the court ruled that his wife&#x27;s &quot;implied consent&quot; by virtue of marriage extended only to vaginal intercourse, not to other acts such as fellatio. (At that time the offense of &#x27;rape&#x27; dealt only with vaginal intercourse.) In &quot;R v Sharples&quot; (1990) it was alleged that the husband had raped his wife in 1989. Despite the fact that the wife had obtained a family protection order before the alleged rape, the judge refused to accept that rape could legally occur, concluding that the family protection order had not removed the wife&#x27;s implied consent, ruling that: &quot;it cannot be inferred that by obtaining the order in these terms the wife had withdrawn her consent to sexual intercourse&quot;.

=====Aftermath=====
By 1991, when the exemption was removed, the Law Commission in its &quot;Working Paper&quot; of 1990 was already supporting the abolition of the exemption, a view reiterated in their &quot;Final Report&quot; that was published in 1992; and international moves in this direction were by now common. Therefore, the result of the &quot;R v R&quot; case was welcomed. But, while the removal of the exemption itself was not controversial, the way through which this was done was; since the change was not made through usual statutory modification. The cases of &quot;SW v UK&quot; and &quot;CR v UK&quot; arose in response to &quot;R v R&quot;; in which the applicants (convicted of rape and attempted rape of the wives) appealed to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that their convictions were a retrospective application of the law in breach of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They claimed that at the time of the rape there was a common law exemption in force, therefore their convictions were &quot;post facto&quot;. Their case was not successful, with their arguments being rejected by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that the criminalization of marital rape had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the criminal law in the light of the evolution of social norms; and that the Article 7 does not prohibit the gradual judicial evolution of the interpretation of an offense, provided the result is consistent with the essence of the offense and that it could be reasonably foreseen.
A new definition of the offense of &#x27;rape&#x27; was created in 1994 by the section 142 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, providing a broader definition that included anal sex; and an even broader definition was created by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, including oral sex. The law on rape does not—and did not ever since the removal of the marital exemption in 1991—provide for any different punishment based on the relation between parties. However, in 1993, in &quot;R v W 1993 14 Cr App R (S) 256&quot;, the court ruled: &quot;It should not be thought a different and lower scale automatically attaches to the rape of a wife by her husband. All will depend upon the circumstances of the case. Where the parties are cohabiting and the husband insisted upon intercourse against his wife&#x27;s will but without violence or threats this may reduce sentence. Where the conduct is gross and involves threats or violence the relationship will be of little significance.&quot;

====Northern Ireland====

At the time of &quot;R v R&quot; (see &quot;England and Wales&quot; above), rape in Northern Ireland was a crime at common law. Northern Ireland common law is similar to that of England and Wales, and partially derives from the same sources; so any (alleged) exemption from its rape law was also removed by &quot;R v R&quot;. In March 2000, a Belfast man was convicted for raping his wife, in the first case of its kind in Northern Ireland.
Until 28 July 2003, rape in Northern Ireland remained solely an offense at common law that could only be committed by a man against a woman only as vaginal intercourse. Between 28 July 2003 and 2 February 2009 rape was defined by the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 as &quot;any act of non-consensual intercourse by a man with a person&quot;, but the common law offense continued to exist, and oral sex remained excluded. On 2 February 2009 the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 came into force, abolishing the common law offense of rape, and providing a definition of rape that is similar to that of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 of England and Wales. The Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland has the same policy for marital rape as for other forms of rape; it states in its &quot;Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Rape&quot; document that: &quot;The Policy applies to all types of rape, including marital and relationship rape, acquaintance and stranger rape, both against male and female victims&quot;.

====Australia====
In Australia, the immunity for marital rape was removed in all states and territories, either by statute or judicial decision, between late 1970s and early 1990s. Previously, the exemption of marital rape was based on the English common law offense of rape, being generally understood as &quot;carnal knowledge&quot;, &quot;outside of marriage&quot;, of a female against her will. The common law definition of rape continued to apply in some states, while others codified the definition, which in each case included a marital exemption. In Queensland, for example, the provision read: &quot;Any person who has carnal knowledge of a woman or girl, &quot;not his wife&quot;, without her consent, or with her consent, if the consent is obtained by force, or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of bodily harm, or by means of false and fraudulent representations as to the nature of the act, or, in the case of a married woman, by personating her husband, is guilty of a crime, which is called rape.&quot;

The first Australian state to deal with marital rape was South Australia, under the progressive initiatives of Premier Don Dunstan, which in 1976 partially removed the exemption. Section 73 of the &quot;Criminal Law Consolidation Act Amendment Act 1976&quot; (SA) read: &quot;No person shall, by reason only of the fact that he is married to some other person, be presumed to have consented to sexual intercourse with that other person&quot;. Nevertheless, the laws did not go as far as equating marital with non-marital rape; the law required violence or other aggravating circumstances, in order for an act of marital intercourse to be rape.

The first Australian jurisdiction to completely remove the marital exemption was New South Wales in 1981. Western Australia, Victoria, and ACT did the same in 1985; and Tasmania in 1987. Discussions of criminalization of marital rape were already taking place in Queensland in the late 1970s, but it was not until 1989 that the exemption was removed and the Northern Territory did the same in 1994. In 1991, in &quot;R v L&quot;, the High Court of Australia ruled that &quot;if it was ever the common law that by marriage a wife gave irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse by her husband, it is no longer the common law.&quot; The case led to South Australia changing its law in 1992.

====India and Pakistan====
In India and Pakistan there are no law provisions related to the marital rape but they are being demanded by the commission to enact laws to bring it in the criminal jurisdiction. In India, the controversies persist in the socio-legal discourse surrounding the issue of marital rape. These debates not only ignore the pain, trauma and suffering women face because of sexual violence within an unequal marriage relationship but also overlook the fact that women are powerless and vulnerable in such a patriarchal setup

==Marriage after rape==
In a variety of cultures, marriage after a rape of an unmarried woman has been treated historically as a &quot;resolution&quot; to the rape, that is, a &quot;reparatory marriage&quot;. In some countries, the mere offer to marry the person one has raped is sufficient to exonerate the perpetrator from criminal prosecution. Although laws that exonerate the perpetrator if he marries his victim after the rape are often associated with the Middle East, such laws were very common around the world until the second half of the 20th century. For instance, as late as 1997, 14 Latin American countries had such laws, although most of these countries have now abolished them.

Whether women were forced to marry their rapist, or the marriage was concluded before the violence began, many victims remain in chronically violent relationships. While there are many reasons for which victims of marital rape remain in their marriages, one important reason is that divorce may be hard to obtain and/or is stigmatized. Cross-culturally, one of the barriers that keep victims within their marriages is the shame and guilt they feel surrounding marital rape, or general taboos around sexuality. Lastly, some victims do not categorize their abuse as marital rape in order to minimize the violence they endure. This is used as a defense mechanism so they can continue to endure their abuse.

=== In the context of forced and child marriage ===
Forced marriage and child marriage are prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in parts of Asia and Africa. A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent; while a child marriage is a marriage where one or both parties are younger than 18. These types of marriages are associated with a higher rate of domestic violence, including marital rape. These forms of marriage are most common in traditional societies which have no laws against sexual violence in marriage, and where it is also very difficult to leave a marriage. Incidents taking place in some of these countries (such as Yemen) have received international attention. The World Health Organization states, under the rubric &quot;Customary forms of sexual violence&quot;, (pp. 156):
:&quot;Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practicelegal in many countriesis a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent. The majority of them know little or nothing about sex before they are married.&quot;

One type of forced marriages occurs in Guatemala (called robadas) and Mexico (called rapto). Robadas refers to &quot;...abductions, in which women are &#x27;taken&#x27; during the period of courtship, sometimes semivoluntarily but other times by force, by a suitor who wants to start a marital relationship with them&quot;. Rapto refers to &quot;...an abduction for sexual or erotic purposes or marriage&quot;. Following the abduction, marriage is often encouraged to maintain the family honor.

In these types of forced marriages, the marital union begins with the man&#x27;s intense sense of control over the woman, combined with the understanding that the wife is the possession of her husband. This foundation of marriage had direct implications for sexual violence within the marriage. In reference to the practice of robadas, Cecilia Menjívar writes, &quot;...unions that start out from the violent act of a robada can continue to breed violence, abuse, and mistreatment in the union.&quot; In addition, women victims of robadas often face embarrassment and blame, despite the act usually being initiated by male perpetrators. Women are blamed for disobeying their parents or not resisting their abductor strong enough. This notion of blaming the woman also occurs in reference to rapto in rural Mexico. Silvie Bovarnick writes, &quot;In many cases, men and women alike look for the fault of responsibility in women&#x27;s behavior due to traditional conceptualisations of women as &#x27;pillars of honour.&#x27;&quot; Abduction and rape compromises a woman&#x27;s moral integrity, and therefore her honor. Many of these women, who were given little choice in their marriage, are left to live with their abusers.

==Prevalence==

The prevalence of marital rape is difficult to assess, especially outside the Western World. Discussing sexual matters in many cultures is taboo. One problem with studies on marital rape is that the Western concept of consent is not understood in many parts of the world. Because many societies operate on social norms which create a dual system of sexual morality—one for sexual intercourse that is &quot;marital&quot; which is seen as an obligation that cannot be refused, and &quot;extra-marital&quot;, which is seen as wrong (or illicit/illegal). Issues of consent are poorly understood, especially by young wives (which are often young girls who do not have a proper understanding of sexual rights). For instance in an interview in a study for the World Health Organization, a woman from Bangladesh who described being hit by her husband and forced to have sex said that: &quot;&quot;I thought this is only natural. This is the way a husband behaves&quot;.&quot; Research has, nevertheless, associated specific regions with a very high level of violence, including sexual violence, against women by husbands/partners. An example of such a place is Ethiopia.

The prevalence of marital rape depends on the particularly legal, national, and cultural context. In 1999, the World Health Organization conducted a study on violence against women in Tajikistan, surveying 900 women above the age of 14 in three districts of the country and found that 47% of married women reported having been forced to have sex by their husband. In Turkey 35.6% of women have experienced marital rape sometimes and 16.3% often.

The earliest study in the Western World attempting to survey marital rape was an unpublished study by Joan Seites in the spring of 1975. Seites sent questionnaires to 40 rape-crisis centers from a list compiled by the Center for Women Policy Studies (Washington, DC). 16 Centers completed questionnaire for a response rate of 40%. Of the 3,709 reported calls dealing with rape and attempted rape received by the 16 centers, 12 calls dealt with marital rape (0.3%). Because rape-crisis centers did not always record the relationships of the callers, whether the 12 reported calls fully represent the number of married relationships cannot be certainly known.

In 1982 Diana E. H. Russell, a feminist writer and activist, conducted the seminal study on marital rape. Her study surveyed a total of 930 women from San Francisco, California (50% non-response rate, non-English speaking Asian women were specifically excluded as non-reliable respondents), of whom 644 were married, divorced, or who self-identified as having a husband although not married. Six of these women (1%) self-assessed that they had been raped by their husbands, ex-husband, or de facto husbands. The survey interviewers, however, classified 74 (12%) of these women as having been raped. Of the 286 non-married women in the sample, 228 (80%) were classified by the survey interviewers as having been raped. Russell found that when repeated instances of rape as classified by the survey interviewers, by husbands or ex-husbands, over the entire course of the marriage are included, these account for 38% of all rape instances, in comparison to the remaining 62% occurring in non-marital instances.

David Finkelhor and Kersti Yllö published a study in 1985 on marital rape that drew on a scientifically selected area probability sample from the metropolitan Boston area of 323 women who were either married or previously married who had a child living with them between the ages of six and fourteen. The study found that of the women who were married the instance of sexual relations through physical force or the threat thereof was 3%.

In 1994, Patricia Easteal, then Senior Criminologist at the Australian Institute of Criminology, published the results of survey on sexual assault in many settings. The respondents had all been victims of numerous forms of sexual assault. Of the victim sub-sample, 10.4% had been raped by husbands or husbands, with a further 2.3% raped by estranged husbands/&quot;de factos&quot;.

In 2002 Basile published research intended to address the lack of a nationally probability sample to-date that measured intimate sexual coercion faced by married women. Data were collected in a 1997 national poll by a random telephone survey of 1,108 residents in the continental U.S. of persons 18 years old or older. The survey had a 50% response rate. Of the 1,108 respondents, the 506 men were excluded from any inquiry into unwanted sexual experiences, leaving 602 (54%) women respondents for the study. 398 (66%) women indicated no unwanted sexual relations (their marital status is not given), and 204 (34%) women responded as having engaged in unwanted sex after being subject to some level of sexual coercion; types of sexual coercion included receiving &#x27;a gift&#x27;, &#x27;a nice dinner&#x27;, &#x27;a back rub&#x27;, &#x27;kissing&#x27;, etc. through threatened harm and physical coercion. Of this group, a sub-sample of 120 (59%) were married, of which 9% responded as having been subject to physical force.

==Physical and psychological damage==
Rape by a spouse, partner or ex-partner is more often associated with physical violence. A nine-nation study within the European Union found that current or ex-partners were the perpetrators of around 25% of all sexual assaults, and that violence was more common in assaults by ex-partners (50% of the time) and partners (40%) than in assaults by strangers or recent acquaintances (25%). 

Attributing the effects of marital rape in research is problematic as it is nearly impossible to find a large enough sample of spouses to study who have experienced sexual violence but have not also been physically assaulted by their spouse. Marital rape can spread sexually transmitted infections and HIV, adversely affecting a victim&#x27;s physical and psychological health. In sub-Saharan countries with very high prevalence rates of HIV, such as Lesotho, instances of multiple partnerships and marital rape exacerbate the spread of HIV.

While rape by a stranger is highly traumatic, it is typically a one-time event and is clearly understood as rape. In the case of rape by a spouse or long term sexual partner, the history of the relationship affects the victim&#x27;s reactions. There is research showing that marital rape can be more emotionally and physically damaging than rape by a stranger. Marital rape may occur as part of an abusive relationship. Trauma from the rape adds to the effect of other abusive acts or abusive and demeaning talk. Furthermore, marital rape is rarely a one-time event, but a repeated if not frequent occurrence. Whether it takes place once or is part of an established pattern of domestic violence, trauma from rape has serious long-term consequences for victims regardless of whether the assault is prosecuted or not.

Unlike other forms of rape, where the victim can usually remove themselves from the company of the rapist and never interact with them again, in the case of marital rape the victim often has no choice but to continue living with their spouse. This is exacerbated by the fact that in many parts of the world divorce is very difficult to obtain and is also highly stigmatized. The researchers Finkelhor and Yllö remarked in their 1985 metropolitan Boston area study that:

:&quot;When a woman is raped by a stranger, she has to live with a frightening memory. When she is raped by her husband, she has to live with the rapist&quot;.

==Relation to other forms of marital violence==
The historical (and present day in jurisdictions where it still applies) immunity of husbands to have sexual relations with their wives without consent was not the only marital immunity in regard to abuse; immunity from the use of violence was (and still is in some countries) common—in the form of a husband&#x27;s right to use &quot;moderate chastisement&quot; against a &#x27;disobedient&#x27; wife. In the US, many states, especially Southern ones, maintained this immunity until the mid-19th century. For instance, in 1824, in &quot;Calvin Bradley v. the State&quot;, the Mississippi Supreme Court uphold this right of the husband; ruling as follows:

Family broils and dissentions cannot be investigated before the tribunals of the country, without casting a shade over the character of those who are unfortunately engaged in the controversy. To screen from public reproach those who may be thus unhappily situated, &quot;let the husband be permitted to exercise the right of moderate chastisement, in cases of great emergency, and use salutary restraints in every case of misbehaviour, without being subjected to vexatious prosecutions, resulting in the mutual discredit and shame of all parties concerned&quot;

Although by the late 19th century courts were unanimously agreeing that husbands no longer had the right to inflict &quot;chastisement&quot; on their wives, the public policy was set at ignoring incidents deemed not &#x27;serious enough&#x27; for legal intervention. In 1874, the Supreme Court of North Carolina ruled:

&lt;poem&gt;We may assume that the old doctrine, that a husband had a right to whip his wife, provided he used a switch no larger than his thumb, is not law in North Carolina. Indeed, the Courts have advanced from that barbarism until they have reached the position, that the husband has no right to chastise his wife, under any circumstances.

But from motives of public policy,in order to preserve the sanctity of the domestic circle, the Courts will not listen to trivial complaints.

If no permanent injury has been inflicted, nor malice, cruelty nor dangerous violence shown by the husband, it is better to draw the curtain, shut out the public gaze, and leave the parties to forget and forgive.

No general rule can be applied, but each case must depend upon the circumstances surrounding it.&lt;/poem&gt;

Today, husbands continue to be immune from prosecution in case of certain forms of physical abuse against their wives in some countries. For instance, in Iraq husbands have a legal right to &quot;punish&quot; their wives. The criminal code states that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. Examples of legal rights include: &quot;The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom&quot;. In 2010, the United Arab Emirates&#x27;s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.

==Sustaining factors==
===Legal===
Legally, governments have direct impact on the occurrence of marital rape. The state &quot;…engages in the definition, monitoring, and sanctioning of appropriate behavior&quot;. This can play out in criminalizing or not criminalizing marital rape and therefore deeming what is appropriate. Catharine MacKinnon argues that rape laws in male dominated societies exist to regulate access to women from a male perspective, not to protect women&#x27;s right to freely decide whether to engage in sexual intercourse or not. Whatever the reason behind such laws, even when state laws have criminalized marital rape, state institutions perpetuate it. For example, although marital rape has been criminalized throughout the United States, the original laws of the 1980s and 1990s treated marital rape differently from non-marital rape, and in some states this continues to be the case even today (see Marital rape (United States law)). As these laws exemplify, marital rape is seen as somehow less reprehensible than rape outside of marriage. Even when marital rape is prosecuted successfully, courts often pass shorter sentenceseven if the law itself does not stipulate thisbased on the view that sexual violation is less serious if it occurs within marriage. Following this same understanding, British courts often pass lower sentences to marital rape than to other cases of rape because it is believed that it causes less harm to the victim 

Police departments are another state institution that treats domestic violence differently than other forms of violence. Police often label domestic abuse calls as low priority, respond slower, and focus on what provoked the abuse rather than the violent actions of the perpetrator. Also, they often act as mediators in the situation because they may feel that domestic violence is a family matter and therefore not their business.

While government institutional influences are vast, marital rape is often sustained by cultural ideologies. According to Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, the issue of sexual violence, including within marriage, has not been a political spectrum issuethat is a left wing &quot;vs&quot;. right wing issuebut a general ubiquitous part of the culture, &quot;The Left and the Right have consistently had different positions on rape; but neither has acknowledged rape from the point of view of the women who experienced it.&quot;

===Culturally unrecognizable===
For many cultures, ideas of marital rape seem often foreign imposed and contradict the belief that such matters should be dealt with privately rather than by the government. In other instances, notably in the country of India, members of the government have spoken publicly that marital rape cannot be recognized in their culture. The Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs, Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, stated in April 2015, &quot;The concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors, including levels of education, illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, [and] the mindset of the society to treat the marriage as sacrament&quot;. For many other countries, the concept of marital rape is itself an oxymoron. Women in these cultures largely &quot;share the cultural logic that marital rape is a contradiction in terms&quot; while men simultaneously &quot;see women&#x27;s sexual consent in marriage as taken for granted&quot; and therefore &quot;reject the very concept of marital rape&quot;.

The act of imposing sexual intercourse against the will of the wife is often not identified as morally wrong, and so it is difficult to attempt to stop the practice, &quot;Often, men who coerce a spouse into a sexual act believe their actions are legitimate because they are married to the woman.&quot; (WHO, pp. 149). This idea that sexual intercourse in marriage is &#x27;legitimate&#x27; and so it cannot be illegal even when forced, is in some parts of the world fueled by the custom of bride price: its paying is seen as earning the man the right to sexual and reproductive control of his wife. UN Women recommended the abolition of giving bride price, and stated that: &quot;Legislation should [...] State that a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defense to a domestic violence charge. (pp. 25) &quot;

Young women from various settings in South Asia explained in surveys that even if they felt discomfort and did not want to have sex, they accepted their husbands&#x27; wishes and submitted, fearing that otherwise they would be beaten. In many developing countries it is believedby both men and womenthat a husband is entitled to sex any time he demands it, and that if his wife refuses him, he has the right to use force. These women, most of them either illiterate or very poorly educated, are married at very young ages (in Bangladesh, for example, according to statistics from 2005, 45% of women then aged between 25 and 29 had been married by the age of 15), and depend on their husbands for their entire life. This situation leaves women with very little sexual autonomy. The notion that women are sexually autonomous and therefore have the ability to give or retract consent is not universally understood. Gabriella Torres writes, &quot;The degree to which women and men view themselves as unique social beings with a full ability to make choices and suffer consequences varies by culture.&quot; As a result, in cultures where women are not considered autonomous, they are not in a position to refuse sex: they have to choose between unwanted sex and being subjected to violence; or between unwanted sex and being abandoned by their husbands and ending up living in abject poverty.

According to Sheila Jeffreys, in Western countries, &quot;sexual liberation&quot; ideologies have aggravated the problem of male sexual entitlement, leading to women submitting to unwanted sex not only due to physical force or illegal threat, but due to societal pressure: &quot;The force which has operated on them [women] all their lives and continues to operate on them within marriages and relationships remains largely invisible. [...] Such forces include the massive industry of sexology, sex therapy, sex advice literature, all of which make women feel guilty and inadequate for any unwillingness to fulfill a man&#x27;s sexual desires.&quot;

The prohibition of rape serves other purposes, such as protection of the rights of male relatives or husband, enforcing of religious laws against sex outside of marriage, or preservation of a woman&#x27;s respect and reputation in society. Under such ideologies it is difficult to accept the concept of marital rape. Richard A. Posner writes that, &quot;Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable assethis wife&#x27;s chastity or his daughter&#x27;s virginity&quot;. In many countries of the world, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan, the severity of the legal punishment for rape depends on whether the victim was a virgin. Rhonda Copleon writes that, &quot;Where rape is treated as a crime against honor, the honor of women is called into question and virginity or chastity is often a precondition.&quot;

===The way marriages are arranged===
In many cultures, marriages are still arranged for the purpose of procreation, property, and consolidation of extended family relations, often including a bride price or a dowry. In such situations, marriages are pre-arranged as an affair between families and clans. In some cultures, refusal of an arranged marriage is often a cause of an honor killing, because the family which has prearranged the marriage risks disgrace if the marriage does not proceed. Although laws that prohibiting dowries exist in many countries, men continue to demand a dowry in exchange for marriage, especially in rural areas where law enforcement is weak. In Bangladesh, dowry demand at marriage is linked to increased sexual violence. A woman attempting to obtain a divorce or separation without the consent of the husband/extended family can also be a trigger for honor killings. In cultures where marriages are arranged and goods are often exchanged between families, a woman&#x27;s desire to seek a divorce is often viewed as an insult to the men who negotiated the deal.

However, the fact that people in developing countries are increasingly selecting marriage partners by whether they are in lovea much more Western world viewdoes not necessarily improve the situation. These types of marriages, especially in southeastern Nigeria, are putting women in more difficult positions: if one chooses to marry based on love against their family&#x27;s wishes, admitting violence in the relationship is a disgrace because it means admitting that one made the wrong judgement.

===Religion===
====Christianity====
Most of the Western World has been strongly influenced by Christian Bible. The paradisaical narrative of man and woman in Genesis establishes a foundation of marriage:

This doctrine is repeated in the Gospel by Jesus, but with the added conclusion &quot;so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.&quot; The same doctrine is continued in the Epistles in the writings of the Apostle Paul.

It is further explicated by the Apostle Paul, who asserts that neither spouse should deny their partner sex:

On the standing of each party to determine how this biblical principle—denial of conjugal relations—was to be effected was codified as an ecclesiastical canon in 280 A.D. by St. Dionysian of Alexandria: &quot;Persons who are self-sufficient and married ought to be judges of themselves.&quot; The canon was given ecumenical application by the Sixth Ecumenical Council in 691 A.D. Ecclesiastical canons continued to adjudicate marital issues well into the modern era until all but entirely superseded by the civil courts.

The Christian religion teaches that pre-marital sex is fornication, and sexual relations by a married person with someone other than their spouse is adultery, both of which are sins, while sex within marriage is a duty. This concept of &#x27;conjugal sexual rights&#x27; has the purpose to prevent sin (in the form of adultery and temptation) as well as to enable procreation.

The above is interpreted by some religious figures as to render marital rape an impossibility. However, not all religious figures hold this view.

Further, Pentecostal Christianity prescribes gender expectations for married individuals that &quot;…reestablish a patriarchal bargain…&quot; in which &quot;…women acquiesce to men&#x27;s authority in return for certain kinds of support&quot;. Husbands are expected to provide for the family, and in return, wives are to submit to their husband&#x27;s authority. Ultimately, this &quot;…strengthens some of the gender dynamics that make intimate partner violence possible in the first place&quot;.

By contrast, Pope Paul VI in his 1968 encyclical letter &quot;Humanae vitae&quot; wrote that &quot;Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one&#x27;s partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife.&quot; This teaching, which has been reaffirmed more recently by Pope Francis, and has been interpreted by Bertrand de Margerie to condemn &quot;intra-marital rape&quot;, and the use of force in marriage more generally.

====Islam====
====Judaism====
Marital or spousal rape is prohibited by Jewish law. Rabbinic Jewish law is generally based on rabbinic extrapolation from the Torah, and debate by generations of sages around various moral, ethical, and practical topics. The laws derived from these debates govern religious and social life. In the case of spousal rape, the law is derived in part from Proverbs 19:2, &quot;Also, it is not good for the soul to be without knowledge [or wisdom], and he that hastens with his feet sins&quot;. This was stated by Rabbi Rami bar Ḥama said in the name of Rav Assi: &quot;It is prohibited for a man to force his wife in the conjugal mitzvah, [i.e., sexual relations,] as it is stated: “And he who hastens with his feet sins” (Proverbs 19:2). [The term “his feet” is understood here as a euphemism for intercourse.]&quot; Separately, Rava wrote (Ketubot 51b): &quot;&#x27;Any woman against whom assault began under compulsion, even if it terminated with her consent,&#x27; is not considered to have committed adultery, but rather to have been raped.&quot;

Maimonides wrote that while a man&#x27;s wife is &quot;permitted to him at all times&quot;, a &quot;husband may not force himself sexually on his wife, if she does not consent. Rather [intercourse] should be with the consent and happiness of both husband and wife.&quot; The Shulchan Aruch, a major code of Jewish law, addresses this concept in two separate rulings: &quot;A man is forbidden to have intercourse with his wife if he is angry with her&quot;, and &quot;He may not have intercourse without her consent, and if she is not interested he should appease her until she is interested.&quot;

===Gender expectations===

Another sustaining factor is the obligatory roles placed on wives and what they come to understand as their &quot;duty&quot;. For example, &quot;Vietnamese women are expected to sacrifice for their families, especially for their children, which includes, for some, acceding to husbands’ sexual demands&quot;. Their &quot;duty&quot; is to maintain family harmony and happiness. In Guatemala, violence within marriage is so normalized that wives come to believe that this is &#x27;the way things are&#x27; and it is simply their role as a wife to endure the violence. This &quot;normalization of violence [...] rests on a continuum of coercive power that makes possible the mistreatment of women not only in their homes but also in the community, neighborhood, and society at large&quot;. Further, because many of these women believe giving sex is their duty, they do not characterize their experience as marital rape. However, &quot;women who have experienced forced sex in marriage understand this experience as an abuse or violation&quot;, they just may not characterize it as marital rape. Violence is so entrenched in many cultures it simply becomes a way of life, and wives are left to believe they must learn to endure it.

On the other hand, husbands are influenced by the expectations of their masculinity. In Africa, these expectations include being a husband, father, and head of the household which requires men to provide food, shelter and protection. Along with this &quot;obligation of being the provider comes the privilege and authority of patriarchy&quot;. As a result, it is often the man&#x27;s perception that his wife has challenged his authority that leads to the violence.

In the United States, masculinity is understood as a fixed entity that exists despite the changes of everyday life. It is understood as being in comparison to femininity, and more specifically, in opposition to femininity: Masculinity is to superiority as femininity is to subservience. Therefore, masculinity is correlated with aggression in such a way that scholars argue violence is a way for men to show their masculine identity. Another expectation of masculinity is that men are not to show their emotion. Instead, as Robert Connell argues, the &quot;masculine prototype&quot; is a strong and stoic man who appears to remain in control of the situation and his emotions. This sense of control in Western masculinity has direct implications for domestic violence. Scholars argue that some men use violence to regain this sense of control when it is lost.

However, not all men who subscribe to masculinity expectations are violent. In fact, most men, in general, are not violent. For those who are violent, ideals of masculinity seem to play some causal role in their violence. Research shows that &quot;violence is more likely among men who experience a disconnection between their personal circumstances and their emotions&quot;. Evidently, there seems to be some connection between the masculine expectation of suppressing or disconnecting from one&#x27;s emotions, and one&#x27;s tendency to be violent.

Marital rape that occurs in same-sex relationships or is perpetrated by women in heterosexual relationships is even less well studied.

==Universal lived experience==

Although marital rape is not always defined as such in different cultures, there is a universal understanding of the violation that comes with rape. Yllö &amp; Torres argue that &quot;marital rape is regularly constituted across cultures as a locally recognized social violation—one that is understood to impede women in those particular cultural contexts from aspiring to a good human life.&quot; An aspect of this violation is the notion that the victim has not given their consent, however, historically and presently, consent is not always connected to marital sex. In the United States, a woman&#x27;s personhood, and therefore her consent, only began with the suffragist movement that sought women&#x27;s access to equal citizenship. Globally, many cultures do not require a woman&#x27;s consent in marriage because procreation is at the root of such an alliance. Further, some women are forced into marriage where her consent is not considered or required. Despite this cultural variance, &quot;women across many cultures do experience the violation of rape in marriage—even if the way that such violations are experienced and understood differs from culture to culture&quot;.

==Problems in prosecuting marital rape==
The criminalization of marital rape does not necessarily mean that these laws are enforced. A lack of public awareness, as well as reluctance or outright refusal of authorities to prosecute is common globally. For instance, in Ireland, where marital rape was made illegal in 1990, by 2016 there had been only two persons convicted of marital rape. Additionally, gender norms that place wives in subservient positions to their husbands, make it more difficult for women to recognize spousal rape or feel confident that it will be addressed by law enforcement.

There are, and have been, both contemporary and historic problems with prosecuting the perpetrators of spousal rape. One author concluded that chief amongst them has been the reluctance of the various legal systems to recognize it as a crime at all. For example, in the United Kingdom, rape by one&#x27;s spouse was recognized by the House of Lords in &quot;R v R&quot; (1991), [1992] A.C. 599.

Another problem results from prevailing social norms that exist. Thus, if the norms within a society do not see spousal rape as violative of social norms, marital rape laws are unlikely to produce successful prosecutions. For example, in Mali, it is considered unthinkable for a woman to refuse her husband&#x27;s sexual demands; far from being seen as an act of abuse of a wife, marital rape is seen as an incident provoked by the wife who refused to perform her duty: for instance one survey found that 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him.

Other problems arise from the fact that, in some countries where marital rape is illegal, many people are not aware of the existing laws. In some parts of the world marital rape laws are new and rarely enacted, therefore, some people are not aware of their existence. Alternatively, traditional norms concerning marriage may be deeply rooted in the conscience of the population. Substantial segments of the population may therefore not conceptualize that in any modern views of sexuality, it is wroth to force a spouse to have sex is wrong, much less illegal. For instance, a report by Amnesty International showed that although marital rape is illegal in Hungary, in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know that marital rape was a punishable crime: over 41% of men and nearly 56% of women thought it was not punishable as a crime in Hungarian law, and nearly 12% did not know. In Hong Kong, in 2003, 16 months after the criminalization of marital rape, a survey showed that 40% of women did not know it was illegal. A 2010 study in South Africa, (where marital rape was made illegal in 1993), showed that only 55% of respondents agreed with the affirmation &quot;I think it is possible for a woman to be raped by her husband&quot;.

Although in recent years some countries in Africa have enacted laws against marital rape, in most parts of the continent forced marital sex is not a criminal offense. A 2003 report by Human Rights Watch stated that: &quot;With few exceptions across Africa, marital rape is not recognized as a crime, and domestic violence is seen as a right of married men.&quot; The acceptability of domestic violence in most African countries is very high: surveys showed that the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea, 80% in Central African Republic, 79% in South Sudan. Although more countries in Africa are now enacting laws against domestic violence, social norms make it difficult to enforce these laws; and many women are not aware of their rights: for instance in Ethiopia in a survey only 49% of women knew that wife-beating is illegal (it was made illegal under the 2004 Criminal Code). The lack of legal and social recognition of marital rape in Africa has been cited as making the fight against HIV harder.

<text>Newhaven Fort is a Palmerston fort built in the 19th century to defend the harbour at Newhaven, on the south coast of England. It was the largest defence work ever built in Sussex and is now open as a museum.

==History==

===Design and construction===

A new fort to defend the port of Newhaven was a recommendation of the 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, during the administration of Lord Palmerston. The design of the fort commenced in 1862 and was overseen by 22-year-old Anglo-Irish Lieutenant John Charles Ardagh, working from an office in Brighton. The site selected was on cliffs overlooking the harbour called Castle Hill, which was already occupied by a battery which originated in the mid-16th century. Instead of levelling the site, as was customary, Ardagh designed the fort to conform to the existing contours. A 40 foot wide moat protected the northern and western sides of the fort, which were lined with concrete, the first time this material had been used to any extent in a British fortification. The junction of the northern and western arms of the moat was protected by a counterscarp gallery and a sally port. The eastern side overlooking the harbour was protected by a short wet moat and by the embankment of the harbour. A caponier at the foot of the chalk cliffs was reached by a tunnel from within the fort. The garrison was to be housed in casemated barracks built into the northern and western ramparts. The main entrance at the north east angle was accessed by an &quot;Equilibrium Bridge&quot; designed and patented by Ardagh himself.

Work commenced in 1864, with a workforce of 250 men and three steam engines. Shingle for the concrete was taken from the beach and clay for the six million bricks required was found nearby. Work was completed in the summer of 1871 and the guns were emplaced in 1873.

===Military service===
The fort proper was originally armed on the eastern side in the 1870s with two 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns on Moncrieff disappearing carriages, the only such arrangement in the UK. From about 1906 the armament consisted of two modern 6-inch Mark VII breechloading naval guns, and two modern light QF 12-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats.

The main 6-inch Mark VII guns were replaced in 1941 by a battery of BL 6-inch Mk 24 coastal guns (a modern coast defence version of the Mark VII built during World War II), which were located west of the fort. During the Second World War it was manned by the 521st (Kent and Sussex) Coast Regiment, Royal Artillery.

===Preservation===
The army vacated the fort in 1962. Restoration began in 1982 following a failed commercial redevelopment venture, and 6-inch Mk VII guns have been re-installed in the fort to approximate the 1906 - 1941 armament. The fort is preserved and maintained by Lewes District Council as Newhaven Fort.

===Media===
In 2015 the fort&#x27;s network of tunnels was featured extensively in the British horror film, &#x27;The Cutting Room&#x27;.
In the BBC TV programme &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot; (Series 7, Episode 7), Michael Portillo visited Newhaven Fort.

===Events===
Fort Process, a multi-disciplinary sonic arts festival, has been held at the fort in 2014, 2016, and 2018. The festival organizer and arts use the fort-specific architecture and spaces 
as part of their temporary installations. The festival was largely started as an attempt to make use of the fort and help preserve its character.

<doc id="875559" wikidata="Q17008066" url="?curid=875559" title="Liberalism and radicalism in Denmark">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and radicalism in Denmark. It is limited to liberal and radical egalitarian parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in the parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Background==
In Denmark liberalism became a dominant force in 1840, but developed into a conservative direction. After 1870 a second liberal current, based on farmers, arose. This current got finally divided in a social liberal party, Danish Social Liberal Party (&quot;Det Radikale Venstre&quot;, member LI, ELDR), and a conservative liberal party, Liberal Party (&quot;Venstre Danmarks liberale parti&quot;, member LI, ELDR). The origin of the word Venstre in both party names is to be found in the fact that the major Conservative party in the 19th century was called Right, and Venstre (Left) was formed as an opposition party. Thus it refers to an old left/right division of the political scale, in modern terms Venstre is usually considered a right wing party and Det Radikale Venstre as a centre party.

==History==
Below is a timeline listing the name changing and history of the political parties centred on the idea of liberalism in Denmark. Confusingly the term &#x27;left&#x27; is used in the name of some liberal parties in Denmark for historic reasons. It does by no means mean &#x27;left&#x27; as in modern &#x27;left wing&#x27; or socialist, but merely that they were on the contemporary left-wing at the time of their naming:

===National Liberal Party===
*1840: The National Liberal Party (&quot;Nationalliberale Parti&quot;)) is formed
*1884: The National Liberal Party merged into the conservative Right (&quot;Høyre&quot;)

===From The United Left to Liberal Party (Venstre)===
*1870: Liberal farmers formed the liberal party The United Left (&quot;Det Forenede Venstre&quot;)
*1892: The United Left fell apart in the Left Reform Party (Venstrereformpartiet) and the ⇒ Moderate Left
*1905: A radical faction of the party seceded as present-day ⇒ Danish Social Liberal Party
*1910: The VRP and the ⇒ Moderate Left merged into Liberal Party (&quot;Venstre&quot;, now usually not translated into English)
*1934: A right-wing faction seceded as the conservative &quot;Free People&#x27;s Party&quot; (&quot;Det Frie Folkeparti&quot;)
*1965: A left-wing faction formed the ⇒ Liberal Center

===Moderate Left===
*1892: A right wing faction of the ⇒ United Left formed the Moderate Left (&quot;Det Moderate Venstre&quot;)
*1910: The Moderate Left merged into the new ⇒ Liberal Party

===Danish Social Liberal Party (Radikale Venstre)===
*1905: A radical faction of the ⇒ Left Reform Party seceded as the present-day Danish Social Liberal Party (&quot;Det Radikale Venstre&quot;, literally Radical Left)
*2007: An MP and an MEP defected from the party in May 2007 and formed the Social Liberal/Social Conservative Ny Alliance.

===Liberal Center===
*1965: A left-wing faction of the ⇒ Left formed the Liberal Center (&quot;Liberalt Centrum&quot;)
*1968: LC disappeared

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and centrism in [[Finland]]. It is limited to liberal and centrist parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

Liberalism was a major force in Finland since 1894. After independence the current gradually decreased. A major other force, agrarianism, choose in 1965 to develop itself into a more centrist current. The liberal character of the Finnish Center (&quot;Suomen Keskusta&quot;), member of LI and ELDR, is based on liberal ideas like decentralization, peasant-like freedom and progressivism. The Swedish minority party Swedish People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Svenska Folkpartiet i Finland&quot;) is also a member of LI, ELDR. The original liberal current is now organized in the Liberals (&quot;Liberaalit&quot;), a very small extra-parliamentary party. At the autonomous island of Åland the Liberals for Åland (&quot;Liberalerna på Åland&quot;) are a dominant force.

<doc id="875562" wikidata="Q17050715" url="?curid=875562" title="Liberalism in Japan">
<text>Japanese liberalism formed in the nineteenth century as a reaction against traditional society. In the twentieth century &#x27;liberal&#x27; gradually became a synonym for conservative, and today the main conservative party in the country is named . The defunct was considered in part a centrist-liberal party, as are most parties which derived from it. The liberal character of the is disputed, as it is also considered to be conservative by some. This article is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, proved by having had representation in parliament.

== Modern Japanese liberalism ==
Liberals in Japan are generally considered united by one major factor: their opposition to changing the post-World War II constitution forbidding the creation of a national military.

Before the 1990s, Japanese liberals did not form a prominent individual political party.
* Japan&#x27;s radical liberalism (left-wing liberalism) emerged as a &quot;peace movement&quot; and was largely led by the Japan Socialist Party (JSP).
* Until the 1990s, conservative liberalism (right-wing liberalism) in Japan was led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and they contrasted with left-wing liberalism.

Since the 1990s, most conservative liberals have left the LDP. The Japan New Party (JNP) and New Party Sakigake are the parties founded by Japanese conservative-liberals against the LDP&#x27;s nationalist project, which lead to the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)-liberalism tradition. Japan&#x27;s previous liberal party, the DPJ, was led by moderates of both the right-wing LDP and left-wing JSP.

Currently, the LDP has not been considered a liberal party. In the past, liberals in the LDP became opposition forces after leaving the party, so &quot;liberal&quot; generally became a force against &quot;conservative&quot; in Japanese politics in the 21st century. The current DPJ-liberalism tradition is being continued by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ).

Since Japanese conservatism was influenced by Shinto, Japan&#x27;s radical liberalism and democratic socialism were more influenced by Christianity.

As the LDP becomes an increasingly solid conservative party, and the socialist movement that led the traditional anti-LDP camp has lost control in Japan&#x27;s opposition political camp, gradually shifting from the centre-right &quot;liberal&quot; in the European and Australian sense of the past to the centre-left &quot;liberal&quot; in the American sense. Currently, the LDP is the largest conservative party in Japan, and the CDPJ is the largest liberal party in Japan.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Norway]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having been represented in the Norwegian Parliament, Stortinget.

==Background==
The Liberal Party (&quot;Venstre&quot;, literally &quot;Left&quot;) was the first organized political force in Norway, and was for long times the dominant political party (from the 1880s to the 1920s). Since the Second World War, it has been one of the minor parties, but still represented in parliament. Today, Venstre is a centrist liberal party. Venstre is also one of the founding members of the Liberal International. Venstre calls itself &#x27;the only liberal party in Norway&#x27;, though this is disputed by other parties who also refer to themselves as liberal.

The Conservative Party (&quot;Høyre&quot;, literally &quot;Right&quot;,) was the second organized political party in Norway. After the Second World War, it has at points been the second largest party in elections. In its policies, Høyre supports moderate free market liberalism, while being moderately conservative in social issues. There are, however, more liberally oriented factions within the party.

The Progress Party (Norwegian: &quot;Fremskrittspartiet&quot;) formed in 1973. Over the years, the party has supported a variety of liberal positions, especially in regards to a market economy, but also on some social issues. During the 1980s, the party was influenced by libertarianism, but this influence has decreased from the early 1990s and onwards. Since 2006, the party has become more socially conservative in orientation. This might have changed again to a certain degree recently however, as the party chose to vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the 2013 national convention, as well as party leader Siv Jensen&#x27;s focus on liberalism in recent news articles. The Progress Party is also skeptical of non-Western immigration, which could be seen as conflicting with traditional liberal values. The party has in several elections been the second largest party in Norway, but has never participated in government until the election of 2013, when they formed a coalition government with the Conservative Party.

The Capitalist Party (Norwegian: &quot;Liberalistene&quot;) is a newer party grounded in classical liberalism and Laissez-faire capitalism. It advocates personal freedom and autonomy. This party has not yet been represented in parliament.

The Liberal People&#x27;s Party (Norwegian: &quot;Det Liberale Folkepartiet&quot;) is a minor, classical liberal party, with a focus on Objectivism. It has never been represented in parliament.

==History==
The following are events of Norway&#x27;s liberalism, beginning with the 19th century.
* 1800s: The Haugean movement was a Christian and classical liberal movement that advocated for religious freedom and economic liberalism.
* 1814: Norway got one of the most democratic and liberal constitutions in Europe.
* 1842: The Conventicle Act was repealed.
* 1852: The Jewish Clause of the Norwegian Constitution of 1814 was repealed, allowing Jews to live in Norway.
* 1865: , founded by Søren Jaabæk, was a classical liberal organization that advocated for republicanism and greater economic liberalism.
* 1869: was founded in parlament.
* 1884: The liberal and radical groups in Stortinget (up until that time collectively referred to as &quot;venstre&quot;, without capitalisation) organised a political party, Venstre. Venstre deposes the incumbent conservative government in an impeachment trial in the same year, and the leader of Venstre, Johan Sverdrup, becomes the first Prime Minister of Norway taken from the ranks of Stortinget.
* 1888: A group of Christian conservatives leaves Venstre to form &quot;Moderate Venstre&quot; (The Moderate Left). The party is later reunited with Venstre, but the present-day Christian People&#x27;s Party also claims Moderate Venstre as its forerunner.
* 1891: The Austrian &quot;Farmand magazin was founded.&quot;
* 1909: The right wing of Venstre leaves the party and forms &quot;Frisinnede Venstre&quot; (Free-minded Liberal Party).
* 1911: A radical faction leaves Venstre to form &quot;Arbeiderdemokraterne&quot; (Labour Democrats). This party is later renamed &quot;Radikale Folkeparti&quot; (Radical People&#x27;s Party).
* 1936: Radikale Folkeparti is reabsorbed into Venstre. Frisinnede Venstre is merged with the main conservative party, Høyre (literally &quot;Right&quot;)
* 1972: Venstre is split over the issue of Norway&#x27;s accession to the European Economic Community. The Pro-EEC faction forms &quot;Nye Venstre&quot; (New Left), later renamed &quot;Det Liberale Folkeparti&quot; (Liberal People&#x27;s Party).
* 1988: Venstre and Det Liberale Folkeparti are reunited.
* 1992: Former members of the Det Liberale Folkeparti founded the a new Liberal People&#x27;s Party.
* 1994: A libertarian wing of the populist Progress Party, counting among them four members of Stortinget, forms its own party, Fridemokratene (Free Democrats) or joined the Det Liberale Folkepartiet. The party is reduced to insignificance after the general elections of 1997.
* 2003: The Civita first libreal and conservative think tank is founded.
* 2005: Venstre gains ten seats in Parliament at the general elections, forming the largest socialLiberal group in Stortinget since 1972.
* 2014: &quot;Liberalistene&quot; (Classical Liberals) was founded.
* 2017: Det Liberale Folkeparti merged with Liberalistene.

<text>Liberalism in South Africa has encompassed various traditions and parties.

The moderate South African Party and its successor, the United Party, formed government several times between the formation of the Union and the election of the National Party in 1948. In 1959, members of the United Party formed the Progressive Party, a precursor to the present-day Democratic Alliance. Separately, in 1953, the anti-Apartheid and multi-racial Liberal Party of South Africa was formed, before disbanding in 1968.

Various South Africans have contributed prominently to liberalism in the country.

== History ==

=== Timeline ===

==== Progressive Party to Unionist Party ====
*1890: The Progressive Party was formed.
*1910: PP merged with the Constitutional Party from the Orange River Colony and the Progressives from the South African Republic to form the Unionist Party.
*1920: The Unionist Party merged into the ⇒ South African Party.

==== South African Party ====

* 1911: The South African Party was formed of various pre-Union parties. Led by the moderate Louis Botha, it formed the first government of a united South Africa. The party&#x27;s support base included English-speaking white South Africans who developed a pattern of supporting the most moderate Afrikaner politicians to avoid domination. The party&#x27;s own &#x27;liberal&#x27; wing was led by Jan Hofmeyr.
* 1934: SAP merged into the ⇒ United Party.

==== United Party ====

* 1934: The United Party was formed in response to the Great Depression, combining Jan Smuts&#x27; South African Party and most of Barry Hertzog&#x27;s National Party.
* 1939: Hertzog left the party and a split formed following South Africa&#x27;s entry into the Second World War. The party increasingly resembled the former South African Party.
* 1948: The United Party, led by Jan Smuts, lost in the 1948 election to the Reunited National Party. The United Party based its platform on the recommendations of the Fagan Commission, which determined total segregation to be impossible, and advocated a relaxation of restrictions on black African migration into urban areas. The Reunited National Party, conversely, had campaigned on total racial separation.

=== Mahlabatini Declaration ===

On 4 January 1974, Transvaal United Party leader Harry Schwarz met with Mangosuthu Buthelezi and signed a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa, which came to be known as the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for the government of South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a bill of rights. It also affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means, at a time when neither the National Party nor the African National Congress were looking to peaceful solutions or dialogue. The declaration enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white political leaders in South Africa and was heralded by many as a breakthrough in race relations in South Africa. Liberal figures and others such as Alan Paton praised the declaration. The declaration drew much media interest both inside and outside South Africa. Schwarz, leader of the liberal &#x27;Young Turks&#x27; in the UP, would be expelled with other liberals from the party the following year.

<doc id="875565" wikidata="Q10560995" url="?curid=875565" title="Liberalism and centrism in Sweden">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and centrism in [[Sweden]]. It is limited to liberal and centrist parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this article it is not necessary for parties to have labelled themselves as a liberal party.

==Background==
Liberalism has been a major force in Sweden since the 19th century. And even before then, personalities like Anders Chydenius (1729 – 1803), promoted the ideals of liberalism. Nowadays The Liberals (&quot;Liberalerna&quot;, member of LI and ALDE) calls itself a centre-right liberal party. The Centre Party (&quot;Centerpartiet&quot;, member of LI and ALDE) is a historically agrarian party that has gradually developed into a liberal party. Since their party congress in 2013, they define themselves as a green, liberal party.

==History==

===From People&#x27;s Party to The Liberals===
*1895: The liberal wing of the Old Party of the Gentry (&#x27;&#x27;Gamla Lantmannapartiet&quot;) seceded and formed the People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Folkpartiet&quot;)

<text>De La Salle Canlubang, currently De La Salle University – Laguna Campus, was a private Catholic basic and higher education institution and a member institution of De La Salle Philippines run by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Biñan, Laguna, Philippines. It is located right across the Laguna Technopark district. The campus, which was acquired on 2003, is a prime property. Part of this property was donated by the family of the late National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin (DLSU HS 1947).

In 2012, the administrators of De La Salle University- Manila and De La Salle Canlubang approved the integration of DLSC to DLSU, becoming the DLSU Science &amp; Technology Complex or DLSU Leandro V. Locsin Campus, then later renamed to De La Salle University – Laguna Campus.

==History==
The Brothers of the Christian Schools, officially known as &quot;Fratres Scholarum Christianarum&quot; or FSC, is a congregation dedicated to the teachings espoused by Saint Jean Baptiste de La Salle.

The first De La Salle School in the Philippines was opened on June 16, 1911, along General Luna, Paco, Manila at the request of the Archbishop of Manila. In 1921, the school was moved to its present site on Taft Avenue. Unable to accommodate requests for admission to the elementary grades, they had to revert an earlier policy not to expand. To date, they have spread out to different provinces. The Brothers have since opened in Greenhills, Antipolo, Lipa, Bacolod, Iligan, Dasmarinas, and Alabang. They have also undertaken supervision of some schools in Manila, Cavite, Bataan, Cebu, Bukidnon, Surigao del Sur, Negros Occidental, Masbate, Capiz, and Ozamis. Today they are known as De La Salle Supervised Schools.

Around 1977, the idea of having another La Salle School, this time in the Laguna area was conceptualized. This was when Architect Lindy Locsin, then a member of Manila&#x27;s De La Salle University (DLSU) board of Trustees, offered to donate several hectares of his family&#x27;s land to La Salle. In 1997, this generous donation of the Locsins was realized. La Salle purchased additional contiguous lands making De La Salle Canlubang a sprawling fifty-hectare campus.

Laguna is fast becoming the country&#x27;s industrial and technological site. Its large, industrial companies presently make it the home of the first Science Technological Park. In response to the ever-quickening pace of scientific and technological development of modern times, the concept of a three-level science and technology oriented school took root. Hence, De La Salle Canlubang (DLSC) was established in June 2003 in order to address the educational concerns of our nation with its youth as its strength. They are envisioned to be grounded on science and technological skills cloaked in the ideals of St. La Salle as an answer to the demands and challenges of the 21st century.

The Integrated school opened its doors to 240 students from preschool to grade 4 and grade 8 (second year high school) during its first year. The curriculum adapts to the science education as its basis. Science emphasizes hands-on exploration and direct experience with the natural world; thereby producing young scientists who are well-rounded and whose strength include: science and technological skills, clear-analytical thinking, and scientific literacy, to be active members of society.

After DLSC was integrated into DLSU to become De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex (DLSU -STC) in 2012, its Integrated School has grown to be one of the most progressive educational institutions south of Metro Manila with a population of more than 1,000 students from Kinder 1 to Grade 12 geared towards producing lifelong learners with the spirit of Faith, Service and Communion and equipped to meet the challenges of the new 2000 millennium. The campus was later renamed De La Salle University - Laguna Campus.

==Campus==
===Milagros R. del Rosario Building===
The first building to be constructed on campus is the four-storey Milagros V. del Rosario Building, which houses the school&#x27;s administrative offices and classrooms. The building was donated to the school by Ambassador Ramon V. del Rosario. The building has 35 classrooms, a 200-seat auditorium, three audio-visual rooms, three libraries, a media lab, a dark room for the photography students, a radio station, a children&#x27;s playroom, a robotics classroom, and three computer laboratories. Construction began in April 2002 and was completed in June 2003 and was designed by the firm L.V. Locsin and Partners.

===Integrated School Building===
Beginning construction in August 2005, the Integrated School building was finished in March 2006, right on time for the following academic year. The IS Building houses the classrooms and other spaces for the Nursery students of the Integrated School. The building used to have a canteen of its own near the Pergola, but now it is where the LC1 clinic is.

===Pergola===
The Pergola is a multi-purpose hall for the students. It stands beside the new Integrated School Building. It is used for the weekly prayers (Every 1st Monday of each month), it also is where some of the sports activities are held in the annual Sports Fest.

=== Learning Center 1 (LC1) ===
It houses the classrooms for Preschool, Kindergarten, Elementary school (Grades 1–4). Also considered to be part of LC1, LC1 Annex or more commonly Annex is where the Student Discipline and Formations Office or SDFO is.

===Learning Center 2 (LC2) ===

<text>Ward&#x27;s Stone is the highest hill in the Forest of Bowland, England. Its flat top hides two trig points nearly a kilometre apart. The western trig point sits atop of large rocks, including one, the Ward&#x27;s Stone, that is so large it attracts boulderers and climbers.

The path from Grit Fell is difficult: crossing Cabin Flat, it weaves its way across hidden pools of stagnant water, the presence of which is betrayed by a form of red grass. White markers supposedly point out the way, but more often result in leading the walker astray. The second trig points faces the empty vastness of the eastern Forest of Bowland, with the summits of Wolfhole Crag, White Hill and the distant Ingleborough breaking the horizon. A second path approaches Ward&#x27;s Stone from Tarnbrook, where limited parking is available.

On the southern slope of this hill are Thorn Crag, Hell Crag and Long Crag, rocky outcroppings that are popular with climbers. Within Thorn Crag, a shallow cave system exists that leads to Hell Crag; this route was first traversed by Lancaster University Mountaineering Club.

<text>Henry Perrin Beatty (born June 1, 1950) is a Canadian corporate executive and former politician, who served as a Progressive Conservative of the House of Commons from 1972 to 1993, and as a cabinet minister from 1979 to 1980 and again from 1984 to 1993.

==Life and career==
Beatty is a graduate of Upper Canada College in Toronto, Ontario, and of the University of Western Ontario in London.

He first won election to the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative at the age of 22 in the 1972 election.

In 1979 he became, at the time, the youngest person ever appointed to a Canadian Cabinet when Prime Minister Joe Clark made Beatty his minister of state for the Treasury Board in his short-lived government. Beatty returned to the opposition benches as a result of the defeat of the Clark government in the 1980 election.

With the Conservative victory in the 1984 election, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made Beatty Minister of National Revenue and Minister responsible for Canada Post. He subsequently served as Solicitor General of Canada (1985–1986), Minister of National Defence (1986–1989), Minister of National Health and Welfare (1989–1991), and Minister of Communications (1991–1993).

Despite long being touted as a future Tory leader, Beatty did not run in the 1993 Progressive Conservative leadership election to succeed Mulroney. He was promoted to Secretary of State for External Affairs in the short-lived government of Mulroney&#x27;s successor, Kim Campbell, but lost his seat in the 1993 election which returned only two Tory MPs.

In 1995 the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien appointed Beatty President and Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, a position he held until 1999 when he became president and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters, a business association that promotes the interests of Canadian industry and exporters.

In August 2007 Beatty left the CME to become president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
Beatty served as Chancellor of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) in Oshawa, Ontario from 2008 to 2015. He has received honorary degrees from UOIT and Western University.

In 2012 Beatty received an honorary Certified International Trade Professional (CITP) designation from the Forum for International Trade Training.

In May 2020, Beatty was appointed to serve on Canada&#x27;s COVID-19 Supply Council.

<doc id="875580" wikidata="Q17644071" url="?curid=875580" title="Shoreham Redoubt">
<text>Shoreham Redoubt (also known as Shoreham Fort or Kingston Redoubt) is a historical military defensive structure and scheduled monument at the entrance to Shoreham harbour, at the mouth of the River Adur in West Sussex, England. It was planned in the 1850s during a period of political alarm in the United Kingdom. Construction of the fort was completed in June 1857 at a cost of £11,685 (equivalent to approximately £1.2 million today). The design is similar to that of Littlehampton Fort, which had been built in 1854.

==Description==

The fort consisted of a gun platform 15 ft (4.6m) above sea level and was in the shape of a lunette, that is a straight sided crescent. The gun platform and ramparts were surrounded by a ditch, with a Carnot wall running along its centre, designed to halt attackers attempting to cross the ditch. The wall itself had loopholes for defenders to fire through. Instead of the open bastions at the Littlehampton fort, Shoreham had a caponier with a brick roof at each of the three angles of the walls. This meant that riflemen could fire along the walls at besiegers in the ditch. The central caponier straddled the ditch and was connected to the fort by a tunnel under the gun platform and ramparts. The east and west caponiers doubled as latrines. A barrack block at the rear had room for 38 men. The fort was armed with six 68-pounder guns on traversing platforms.

==Later history==
The fort was garrisoned by a battery of the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers, who were considered to be one of the top volunteer artillery units and won a prize for the accuracy of their shooting in 1865.

A military review in 1873 found that the fort&#x27;s original armaments were now obsolete and its construction inadequate. It was also considered to be too vulnerable to attack from the land, having only sea-facing defences. It was recommended that a new, stronger and more defensible fort be built on a site nearby but this was never undertaken. By 1886, the original armament had been updated and replaced by two 80 pounders and three 64 pounder guns.

In the early 20th century the fort served as an open-air film studio for early silent movies, with four films made there in 1914.

During World War II the fort became part of an emergency coastal battery with aiming lights and two 6-inch guns, which were in emplacements built on top of the terreplein. After the war, the fort&#x27;s barrack block was demolished and a coastguard tower built on the gun platform. A restoration of the site was undertaken by West Sussex County Council during 1977 and 1978.

==The site today==
Today the gun platform, ditch, Carnot wall and caponiers can be viewed in their restored state. The foundations of parts of the original barrack block and parade ground can be made out. Outside the fort to the east is a WW2 aiming light station, now used by volunteers from the National Coastwatch Institutionto observe the adjacent harbour entrance and sea approaches.

The redoubt is currently being further restored by a local group of volunteers, the Friends of Shoreham Fort, the aim being to restore it and rebuild the barrack block to create a museum and multi-purpose community asset.

In March and April 2014, an old Nissen hut was located on the site on one of the old Nissen hut bases. The hut is primarily used as an education centre for the Friends of Shoreham Fort as well as a display space. The Nissen hut had been dismantled in late 2013 at its original site near Chichester after two former land girls living there since World War II had died. The hut was then transferred to Shoreham Fort and rebuilt. This Nissen hut has since been confirmed by a project led by Historic England as being the last useable First World War Nissen Hut in the country.

In September 2020 the Friends of Shoreham Fort built a memorial training trench to honour all those who trained in the local area before leaving for France in the First World War. The trench will be used for education and was partly funded by the National Lottery and Adur and Worthing Councils. This has now been listed by the Imperial War Museum as an official War Memorial.

<text>John Patton Jr. (October 30, 1850 – May 24, 1907) was a U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan.

Patton, the son of John Patton and the brother of Charles Emory Patton, was born in Curwensville, Pennsylvania. He prepared for college at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and graduated from Yale College, where he served on the third editorial board of &quot;The Yale Record&quot; and was a member of Skull and Bones in 1875.

After graduating from the law department of Columbia College, New York City, in 1877, he moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1878, was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced the practice of law.

He was appointed by the Governor of Michigan John T. Rich as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Francis B. Stockbridge and served from May 5, 1894, to January 14, 1895, when a successor was elected and qualified. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1895 to fill the vacancy, losing to Julius Caesar Burrows.

<doc id="875585" wikidata="Q2881262" url="?curid=875585" title="Ballet de cour">
<text>Ballet de cour (&quot;court ballet&quot;) is the name given to ballets performed in the 16th and 17th centuries at courts.

The court ballet was a gathering of noblemen and women, as the cast and audience were largely supplied by the ruling class. The festivities, which were descendants of festivals, processions and mummeries dating back to the Middle Ages, looked more like a modern-day parade, than what people today would identify as a ballet performance. Where early court ballet differed from its predecessors, is that it was a secular, not religious happening. It was a carefully crafted mixture of art, socializing, and politics, with its primary objective being to exalt the State.

Because these celebrations occurred long before the proscenium stage had been invented, and were instead executed in large halls with audience members stacked up on three sides of the performance, early court ballet&#x27;s choreography was constructed as a series of patterns and geometric shapes that were intended to be viewed from overhead. Once the performance was through, the audience was encouraged to join the dancers on the floor to participate in a &quot;ball&quot; which was designed to bring everyone in the hall into unanimity with the ideas expressed by the piece. As they developed through time, court ballets began to introduce comedy, went through a phase where they poked fun at manners and affectations of the time, and they moved into a phase where they became enamoured with pantomime. At the time of the court ballet&#x27;s birth, a similar art form appeared in Italy called opera. The difference between the two crafts is that the developing phenomenon in Italy focused on the singing aspect of performance, whereas in France, movement was front and centre.

Early court ballets were influenced by the elaborate entertainments common in royal celebrations and aristocratic weddings of France and Italy. When the Florentine Catherine de’ Medici married the French King Henri II in 1533, French and Italian culture enmeshed as Catherine brought from her native Italy her penchant for theatrical and ceremonial events, including elegant court festivals. A more deliberate contribution the court ballet resulted from the Académie de Poésie et de Musique, founded in 1570 by the poet Jean-Antoine de Baif and the composer Thibault de Courville. The aim of the Academie was to revive the arts of the ancient world in order to harmonize dance, music, and language in a way that could result in a higher level of morality. It was from this marriage of traditional grand spectacle and conscious measured order that court ballets were born.

Jean-Baptiste Lully is considered the most important composer of music for &quot;ballet de cour&quot; and instrumental to the development of the form. During his employment by Louis XIV as director of the Académie Royale de Music, he worked with Pierre Beauchamp, Molière, Philippe Quinault and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine to develop ballet as an art form equal to that of the accompanying music.

== Notable works ==

&quot;Ballet des Polonais&quot; was one of the first works to be recognized as a true court ballet. The spectacle was commissioned by Catherine de’ Medici in 1573 to celebrate the election of her second son, Henry of Anjou, as King of Poland. Performed at the Tuileries Palace and organized by the Italian dancing master, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx, the hour-long ballet consisted of sixteen amateur French ladies representing the sixteen provinces of France. Describing it as the most beautiful ballet ever made on earth, the court observer Brantôme recounted that they &quot;danced their ballet so curiously designed, with so many turns, swerves, and sinuosities, interlacings and minglings, confrontations and withdrawals, that [it was surprising that] no lady ever failed to be at her appointed turn or place.&quot; Although its combination of verse, song and dance had been used before, the intricate figure dancing involved in the &quot;Ballet des Polonais&quot; marked the beginning of the French style that would become the dominant continental school over the next century.

The first &quot;ballet de cour&quot; to fuse dance, poetry, music and design into a coherent dramatic statement was the &quot;Ballet Comique de la Reine&quot;, performed in 1581. As part of the wedding celebration for the queen&#x27;s sister, Marguerite of Lorraine and the Duc de Joyeuse, the plot based on Ulysses’ encounter with Circe was symbolic of the country&#x27;s desire to heal old wounds and restore peace after religious civil wars. Reaching new heights in scale and diversity, the lavish five-hour production included a three tiered fountain, palace, garden, townscape, and chariot-floats. As with &quot;Ballet de Polonais&quot;, Beaujoyeulx choreographed and oversaw the &quot;Ballet Comique&quot;, using form, geometry, measure, and discipline as a foundation that would later develop into the codified ballet technique.

An important step towards the &quot;ballet de cour&quot; in its final form was done during the reign of Louis XIII, with such rich and ravishing ballets de cour as &quot;La Délivrance de Renaud&quot; and the &quot;Ballet de la Merlaison&quot;.
The ballets de cour developed into the comédie-ballet and then the opéra-ballet during the second half of the 17th century. This was a fully operatic form that included ballet as a prominent feature of the performance.

Beauchamp, &quot;superintendent&quot; of the ballet and director of the Académie Royale de Danse, codified the five positions based on the foundations set down by Thoinot Arbeau in his 1589 &quot;Orchésographie&quot;. Emphasising the technical aspects of dance, Beauchamp set out the first rules of ballet technique. The emphasis on turnout, light costumes, female dancers, and long dance sequences with light, flexible footwear, all first seen in &quot;L&#x27;Europe galante&quot; (1697), was a turning point in ballet practice that led to the pre romantic ballet era. Pierre Rameau expanded on Beauchamp&#x27;s work in &quot;Le Maître à danser&quot; (1725), further detailing carriage of the body, steps and positions.

<text>Littlehampton Redoubt, usually known as Littlehampton Fort, was built in 1854 to protect the entrance to the River Arun at Littlehampton on the south coast of England, against possible attack by the French under the Emperor Napoleon III. There had been a previous battery on the east bank of the river, but the new fort was built on the west bank. It consisted of a platform from which cannon could sweep the harbour mouth, with a barracks behind and a surrounding defensive ditch and wall. The fort was an innovative military structure, incorporating the new feature of a Carnot wall. Its active use as a fort was short at only about 20 years, owing to technical changes in armaments, but it was a precursor of the later Palmerston Forts built after the 1860 commission. Littlehampton Fort is now in a ruinous and overgrown state.

== Previous fortifications ==

A battery was planned for the east bank of the Arun at Littlehampton in about 1587, but there is no record of it having been erected and no trace of it has been discovered. There was though a five gun battery at Littlehampton in the early eighteenth century.

In 1756 the Seven Year War with France began and there was a concern about invasion. A battery was erected on the east bank of the river in 1760. This consisted of a bastion set at right angles to the river bank with seven guns which covered the river mouth and seafront. The rampart of this construction still remains incorporated into the amusement park called Harbour Park.

== Plans for a new fort ==
In the 1840s both public opinion and MPs put pressure on the government to better fortify the south coast against a French attack. In 1846 the Duke of Wellington wrote a public letter to Sir John Burgoyne, Inspector of General Fortifications, expressing his concern about the lack of defensive works along the south coast.

Also in 1846 Burgoyne produced a paper entitled “Observations on the Possible Results of a War with France, Under Our Present System of Military Preparation.” This was a vigorous confirmation of everything Wellington had argued. A copy of this paper was sent to Wellington who wrote back a letter to Burgoyne in January 1847 expressing his agreement with all Burgoyne&#x27;s views and reiterating his earlier arguments. Wellington&#x27;s letter was leaked to the press by a friend of Burgoyne&#x27;s wife and published in the Morning Chronicle in 1848 causing huge public alarm and a debate in the House of Commons. This led to discussions in the newspapers, which culminated in Parliament voting additional funds for naval and military expenditure. There was also alarm about the intentions of the Emperor Napoleon III in 1852 to 1853.

The Board of Ordnance decided to build a fort at Littlehampton. Historian John Goodwin comments that &quot;the War Office were worried that [the capture of the ports of Littlehampton and Shoreham] would enable the enemy to use the quays for the supply and reinforcement of troops landed to attack Portsmouth from the rear, prior to a march on London.&quot;

In the early 1850s planning began for construction of a new fort on the west bank of the river. The work was completed in September 1854 at a cost of £7,615. Construction was overseen by Captain Fenwick of the Royal Engineers.The main building work was undertaken by Locke and Nesham, a large London firm who had already constructed several public buildings including Wandsworth Prison. In addition the glacis was built by the local firm of Robert Bushby.

== Description of the 1854 fort ==
The new fort was in the shape of a lunette, a straight-sided crescent. The fort consisted of a platform for the guns with ramparts surrounded by a nine-yard (eight-metre) wide ditch, which incorporated a Carnot wall running along its centre. This was designed to halt attackers attempting to cross the ditch. The wall itself had loop-holes for defenders to fire through. In addition, at each corner were projecting open bastions from which the garrison could fire at besiegers along the length of the wall. To the rear of the gun platform was a fortified barrack block. The fort was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom; its Carnot wall and three open bastions made it unique.
A further barrack block was later built outside the fort to house additional troops. The 1861 Census shows a total complement of 70 men including a gunner, surgeon, drummer, officers, NCOs and privates. The armaments, brought by sea from Woolwich arsenal, were three 68-pounder and two 32-pounder cannons.

== Later history of the fort ==
The Committee on Coast Defences Report of 1873 found that Littlehampton Fort was inadequate as it only had smooth bore guns and it was weakly constructed with open bastions and no casemates for the guns and no iron-cladding. The Committee recommended an upgrade: “Littlehampton – Remodel fort and arm partly or wholly with heavy guns.” The upgrade was never carried out. The guns were finally removed in 1891 and the fort partially dismantled.
Today (2011) the fenced off site is well presented from a viewing place on a wooden walkway laid across the sand dunes. A notice with a diagram describes what can be seen of the fort, that is the surrounding ditch, one of the bastions, part of the Carnot wall and the ramparts behind.

<text>Hans Böhm (died July 19, 1476), also known as the Drummer of Niklashausen, was born in the village of Helmstadt in the south-central region of Germany known as Franconia. The year of Böhm&#x27;s birth is unknown; peasants made little impact in the written historical record. Böhm was a religious revolutionary: his inconspicuous existence changed abruptly.
==Profile== 
Böhm lived in the German town of Niklashausen (present-day Baden-Württemberg), where he made his living as a shepherd and street entertainer. One night in 1476, he had a vision of the Virgin Mary. Böhm&#x27;s conversations with one of the most powerful and beloved saints inspired him to burn his drum in a medieval ritual known as the Bonfire of the Vanities. The ritual served as a public demonstration in which people threw their possessions or vanities into a communal bonfire to signify their dependency on God and adherence to the cult of poverty. More importantly, the Virgin Mary&#x27;s message was one of social equality.

Böhm was to preach on the sins of the clergy: peasants and pilgrims should not pay rents to them, he would eventually call for their deaths. Böhm was also to promote the abolition of forced labor (slavery), tolls, levies and other payments to the nobles. The woods and waters of the earth were to be held in common for the use of all people, rather than just the rich. Böhm&#x27;s sermons calling for a leveling of society were radical in a hierarchical feudal society. The power brokers of the time, the clergy and nobles, deemed such ideas as dangerous. Thus, when in short order tens of thousands of peasants from all over Germany converged on Niklashausen to hear the &quot;Drummer Boy&quot; speak, the authorities sensed a real and imminent threat. The resulting peasant revolt began in early May 1476 and culminated with Böhm&#x27;s heresy trial and his execution, on July 19, that year.

==Historical commentary== 
Böhm&#x27;s story represents the dissatisfaction and resentment of peasants for their physical conditions and demonstrates the only avenue through which they could voice their frustrations: through restructuring religious or spiritual paradigms. Historian Richard Wunderli in his book &quot;Peasant Fires&quot; provides a detailed study of Böhm and the Niklashausen peasant revolt of 1476 and the abstruse peasant mentality.

What little is known about Böhm is obtained from the surviving historical documents written by his enemies, namely the clergy and nobles, such as Count Johann of Wertheim, Archbishop Dieter von Isenberg of Mainz, and Bishop Rudolf von Scherenberg of Würzburg. The story was chronicled in 1514 by Johannes Trithemius.

<doc id="875593" wikidata="Q2984665" url="?curid=875593" title="Gingerbread man">
<text>A gingerbread man is a biscuit or cookie made from gingerbread, usually in the shape of a stylized human being. However, other shapes, especially seasonal themes (Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc.), and characters are also common.

==History==
Gingerbread dates from the 15th century and figurative biscuit-making was practised in the 16th century. The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits was at the court of Elizabeth I of England. She had the gingerbread figures made and presented in the likeness of some of her important guests, who brought the human shape of the gingerbread cookies.

==Characteristics==
Most gingerbread men share a roughly humanoid shape, with stubby feet and no fingers. Many gingerbread people have a face, though whether the features are indentations within the face itself or other candies stuck on with icing or chocolate varies from recipe to recipe. Other decorations are common; hair, shirt cuffs, and shoes are sometimes applied, but by far the most popular decoration is shirt buttons, which are traditionally represented by gum drops, icing, or raisins.

==In world records==
According to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest gingerbread person was made by the staff of the IKEA Furuset store in Oslo, Norway, on 9 November 2009. The gingerbread person weighed 1435.2 pounds (651 kg).

==In fiction and popular culture==
* &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot; is a fairy tale about a gingerbread man who comes to life, outruns an elderly couple and various animals, and is devoured by a fox in the end.
** Gingy is a talking gingerbread man character in the &quot;Shrek&quot; series of animated movies. He is derived from the fairy tale &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;.
** The Jasper Fforde comic detective novel &quot;The Fourth Bear&quot; features a more-than-human-sized gingerbread man who is a psychopathic serial killer who likes to pull off his victims&#x27; limbs. The difficulties in catching him are a reference to the fairy tale.
* In Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; (1892), the eponymous hero leads an army of gingerbread men against the Mouse King and his fellows.
* The Gingerbread People are the main characters in the game &quot;Candy Land&quot; (1945).
* The Gingerbread Men were featured in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. In the &quot;Don Knotts&quot; episode, the Gingerbread Men sing the song &quot;Sweet Gingerbread Man&quot; as the opening number. The lead Gingerbread Man is a hand-rod Muppet performed by Frank Oz while the full-bodied Gingerbread Men were performed by Jim Henson, Dave Goelz, Richard Hunt, and
* In the film &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot;, a nightmarish twist on the Gingerbread Man appears. A young child is splashed with mud, which steals the child&#x27;s eyes, nose, and mouth. It then forms a small mud body with the child&#x27;s stolen features for a face. The creature grabs the child and absorbs her into itself. It runs off yelling, &quot;You can&#x27;t catch me; I&#x27;m the Gingerbread Man!&quot;
* The first game in the &quot;Cookie Run&quot; series, &quot;Ovenbreak&quot;, is a runner game that puts players in the role of GingerBrave, a gingerbread man running to escape from the Witch&#x27;s Oven. Subsequent games would introduce numerous other &quot;Cookies&quot;, iterations of gingerbread men based on different combinations of ingredients and character archetypes.

<doc id="875600" wikidata="Q4861429" url="?curid=875600" title="Barnard E. Bee Sr.">
<text>Barnard Elliot Bee Sr. (1787–1853) was an American attorney and politician. A native of South Carolina, he, with his family, was an early settler of the Republic of Texas. He became a political leader there, serving in several political-appointee positions in the republic.

==Early life and education==
Barnard Bee was born in Charleston, South Carolina, one of several siblings, the son of Thomas Bee and Susannah (Bulline) Bee, both of planter families. His father was a delegate to the Continental Congress and a US Congressman. Barnard studied law, and became an attorney.

==Marriage and family==
Bee married Ann Wragg Fayssoux of Charleston, from a prominent Anglo-French family. Her father&#x27;s line was of French Huguenot descent. They had two sons, Hamilton Prioleau Bee (b. 1822) and Barnard E. Bee Jr. (b. 1824). Hamilton Bee followed his father into politics, serving first in the Republic of Texas Senate in 1846. He was elected to the Texas Legislature in 1849 and served for more than 10 years; in 1855, he was elected as speaker of the house. Both sons served in the Confederate Army as generals during the American Civil War. Barnard Bee Jr. was one of the first Confederate general officers to be killed in the war.

==Political career==
Bee served on the staff of his brother-in-law, James Hamilton Jr., governor of South Carolina from 1830 to 1832.

In 1836, Bee moved his family to Texas and took part in the Texas Revolution. He settled near Houston. Bee served the young republic in a number of political offices: as secretary of the treasury in 1836, secretary of war from 1837–1838, and secretary of state from 1839-1839. In 1839, Texas sent him as an agent to negotiate permanent peace and borders with Mexico. His offers were rejected. He began his return by sailing to Cuba, then obtained passage to Washington, DC.

The Texas government appointed him as minister (ambassador) to the United States. He served in that post from April 20, 1840, to December 13, 1841. He negotiated with Daniel Webster and settled the formal treaty by which the United States recognized Texas.

==Later years==
After his return to Texas, Bee generally took up a private life again. Strongly opposed to the annexation of Texas into the United States, afterward he returned to South Carolina. He died there in 1853, and is buried in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard in Pendleton, South Carolina.

==Legacy and honors==
*Bee County and the city of Beeville in Texas are named in his honor.
*His grandson Carlos Bee was elected and served as a US Congressman from Texas.

<doc id="875608" wikidata="Q390735" url="?curid=875608" title="E.123">
<text>E.123 is an international standard by the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T), entitled &quot;Notation for national and international telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and Web addresses&quot;. It provides guidelines for the presentation of telephone numbers, email addresses, and web addresses in print, on letterheads, and similar purposes.

As described by the standard, ⟨+⟩ is the &quot;international prefix symbol&quot;, should precede the country code, and serves to identify the number following as the international telephone number.

==Example formats==
==Telephone number==
In the international telephone number notation, the leading plus (+) serves as an international prefix symbol, and is immediately followed by the country code. The user or the telephone system should replace the + symbol with international dialing prefix used in the caller&#x27;s location.

Parentheses are used in national notation to indicate digits that are sometimes not dialed, such as area code in variable-length dialing numbering plans. Parentheses are &quot;not&quot; allowed in the international notation, according to the standard, as international callers use fixed number dialing.

For digit grouping, E.123 specifically recommends that:
* only spaces be used to visually separate groups of numbers &quot;unless an agreed upon explicit symbol (e.g. hyphen) is necessary for procedural purposes&quot; in national notation;
* only spaces should be used to visually separate groups of numbers in international notation;
* spaces should separate country code, area code and local number.

No recommendation is made for grouping rules for digits in the local number, instead some examples of commonly used groupings are shown.

In national notation, the trunk prefix can be included with the area code if required by national writing conventions; trunk prefix is included in most European countries whenever they use fixed or variable dialing, but is omitted in USA and Canada where phone numbers only indicate optional area code.

A tilde (~) indicates an additional dial tone that the user should wait for.

A slash (/) with spaces on either side may be used to indicate alternative ending for numbers (i.e. means and ).

The non-dialable PBX (private branch exchange) extension number should be separated by words &quot;extension&quot; or &quot;ext.&quot; in the national language after the phone number.

When the PBX is capable of direct inward dialing, the extension number should be written directly after the phone number, without using any distinct symbols. If there is a need to indicate in-dialing capability of the telephone number, a number of dots (...) corresponding to the length of the extension number can be added at the end.

===Microsoft telephone number format===
Microsoft canonical address format for telephone numbers derives from E.123 international notation by allowing explicit indication of area code with parentheses.

The canonical format is used by the Telephony API (TAPI), a Windows programming interface for dial-up fax, modem, and telephone equipment. Depending on the user&#x27;s current location, the Windows&#x27; Dial-Up Networking (DUN) component applies a set of dialing rules to transform the canonical phone number into a locally dialable calling sequence for the modem device. The dialing rules may include variable-length dialing for area code, trunk access and international access prefixes, central office/service access numbers, and calling cards tone numbers.

With this approach, phone numbers stored in the phone book remain unchanged when the user moves to a different geographical location or selects a different phone service provider.

The calling sequence can contain dialable numbers such as digits codice_1–codice_2 and DTMF tones codice_3, formatting characters codice_4, and control characters codice_5, which correspond to the Dial command of the Hayes AT command set.

== Emergency contact information ==
A standardized language-independent way to identify a next-of-kin (or other emergency contact) in a mobile handset’s directory, in case of an emergency, has in May 2008 been adopted as a new clause in Recommendation E.123.

It proposes to store emergency contact numbers prefixed with Arabic numerals in the form “0nxxxx”; “n” is a digit from 1 through 9 and “xxxx” is any meaningful descriptive character string in any language or script (e.g. “Anna” or “Spouse”).

In the handset&#x27;s directory this would be displayed as &quot;01Anna&quot; or &quot;01Spouse&quot; enabling easy identification by the emergency services. The handset’s directory entry (in the “contact number” field) would contain the actual number of the person to call in case of emergency.

This language-independent recommendation preceded the popular &quot;ICE&quot; (In Case of Emergency) scheme introduced in 2005 to the English-speaking world.

<text>The dong () (; ; sign: ₫ or informally đ and sometimes Đ in Vietnamese; code: VND) has been the currency of Vietnam since 3 May 1978. It is issued by the State Bank of Vietnam. The dong was also the currency of the predecessor states of North Vietnam and South Vietnam, having replaced the previously used French Indochinese piastre.

Formerly, it was subdivided into 10 hao (&quot;hào&quot;), which were further subdivided into 10 &quot;xu&quot;, neither of which are now used due to inflation. The Vietnamese dong has increasingly moved towards exclusively using banknotes, with lower denominations printed on paper and denominations over 10,000 dong, worth about 40¢ dollar or euro, printed on polymer. As of 2022, no coins are used. Generally, Vietnam is moving towards digital payments. The 500,000-dong note (VND) is the highest-denomination banknote in circulation in Vietnam. The note is dark blue in color and has been in circulation since 2003.

As of August 2024, the Vietnamese dong is the third-lowest valued currency unit (behind the Iranian rial and the Lebanese pound), with one United States dollar equaling 25,135 dong.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;đồng&quot; () means &quot;copper&quot; in Sino-Vietnamese.

==History==
===French Indochina===
The piastre (known in Vietnam as &quot;silver&quot;), was the currency of French Indochina between 1885 and 1952.

===North Vietnam===
In 1946, the Viet Minh government (later to become the government of North Vietnam) introduced its own currency, the dong, to replace the French Indochinese piastre at par. Two revaluations followed, in 1951 and 1959; the first was at a rate of 100:1, the second at a rate of 1,000:1.

===South Vietnam===

Notes dually denominated in piastres and dong were issued in 1953 for the State of Vietnam, which evolved into South Vietnam in 1954. On 22 September 1975, after the fall of Saigon, the currency in South Vietnam was changed to a &quot;liberation dong&quot; worth 500 old Southern dong.

===United Vietnam and inflation===
After Vietnam was reunified, the dong was also unified on 3 May 1978. One new dong equalled one Northern dong or 0.8 Southern &quot;liberation&quot; dong.

On 14 September 1985, the dong was revalued again, with one new dong worth 10 old dong. At that time, Vietnamese economists believed that revaluing the currency would increase its value, but it turned out to have the opposite effect: savings of many people were wiped out, the currency experienced unprecedentedly heavy inflation that peaked at 700% in September 1986 and prices skyrocketed. For example, in 1986, the price of agricultural products increased by 2000% compared to ten years before. Aiming to solve this problem, the government banned all forms of non-state-owned internal trade, which they believed to be capitalistic, resulting in an economic crisis so severe that Tố Hữu referred to it as a &quot;vertical downturn&quot;. Despite the inflation rates having stabilized as part of the Đổi Mới reforms, especially during the 1990s and early 2000s, the effects of the crisis still last in the value of the dong, one of the lowest in the world today.

==Coins==
===First dong===
In 1978, aluminum coins dated 1976 were introduced in denominations of 1, 2 and 5 hao, as well as 1 dong. The coins were minted by the Berlin Mint in the German Democratic Republic and bear the state crest on the obverse and denomination on the reverse. Due to the chronic inflation experienced by Vietnam during the 1980s and 1990s, these coins lost all their relevant value and no coins were circulated for many years after this series.

===Second dong===
====Commemorative issues====
Commemorative coins in copper, brass, copper-nickel, silver, and gold have been issued since 1986, but none of these have ever been used in circulation.

====2003 issue====
The State Bank of Vietnam resumed issuing coins on 17 December 2003. The new coins, minted by the Mint of Finland, were in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 dong in either nickel-clad steel or brass-clad steel. Prior to its reintroduction, Vietnamese consumers had to exchange banknotes for tokens with a clerk before purchasing goods from vending machines. This was also to help the state ease the cost of producing large quantities of small denomination banknotes, which tended to wear easily. Many residents expressed excitement at seeing coins reappear after many years, as well as concern for the limited usefulness of the 200 dong coins due to ongoing inflationary pressures.

Since the launch of the 2003 coin series, the State Bank has had some difficulties with making the acceptance of coins universal despite the partial discontinuation of smaller notes, to the point of some banks refusing coin cash deposits or the cashing in of large numbers of coins. This has prompted laws requiring private and municipal banks to transact and offer services for coins and the full discontinuation of small denomination and cotton-based notes. Also, the coins did not gain popularity from the Vietnamese people. Eventually, State Bank of Vietnam withdrew its distribution in April 2011.

==Banknotes==
===First dong===
In 1978, the State Bank of Vietnam (&quot;Ngân hàng Nhà nước Việt Nam&quot;) introduced notes in denominations of 5 hao, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 dong dated 1976. In 1980, 2 and 10 dong notes were added, followed by 30 and 100 dong notes in 1981. These notes were discontinued in 1985 as they gradually lost value due to inflation and economic instability.

===Second dong===
In 1985, notes were introduced in denominations of 5 hao, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 500 dong. As inflation became endemic, these first banknotes were followed by 200, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 dong notes in 1987, by 10,000 and 50,000 dong notes in 1990, by a 20,000 dong note in 1991, a 100,000 dong note in 1994, a 500,000 dong note in 2003, and a 200,000 dong note in 2006. Banknotes with denominations of 5,000 dong and under have been discontinued from production, but as of 2015 are still in wide circulation.

Five banknote series have appeared. Except for the current series, dated 2003, all were confusing to the user, lacking unified themes and coordination in their designs. The first table below shows the latest banknotes, of 100 dong or higher, prior to the current series.
On 7 June 2007, the government ordered cessation of the issuance of the cotton 50,000 and 100,000 dong notes. They were taken out of circulation by 1 September 2007. State Bank of Vietnam 10,000 and 20,000 dong cotton notes are no longer in circulation as of 1 January 2013.

=== Third dong ===
The one-hundred-dong bill technically remains in circulation, however due to its low value (roughly $0.004 USD) it is rarely ever used for transactions. The bill is largely seen as a collectible or an oddity, with it often selling for many times its original face value.

In 2003 Vietnam began replacing its cotton banknotes with plastic polymer banknotes, claiming that this would reduce the cost of printing. Many newspapers in the country criticized these changes, citing mistakes in printing and alleging that the son of the governor of the State Bank of the Vietnam benefited from printing contracts. The government clamped down on these criticisms by banning two newspapers from publishing for a month and considering other sanctions against other newspapers.
Even though the 2003 series banknotes listed in the table below have now completely replaced the old notes of the same denominations, as of 2019 the cotton fibre banknotes of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 dong still remain in wide circulation and are universally accepted.

A commemorative polymer 50 dong banknote dedicated to the fiftieth anniversary of the State Bank of Vietnam was issued in 2001, but its face value is so tiny that it clearly was meant only for collectors. The note is available in three forms, by itself, in a presentation folder or in a presentation folder in an envelope. In 2016, a 100 dong banknote was issued on cotton-based paper to commemorate the 65th anniversary of central banking.

==Bearer&#x27;s checks 1992–2002==
To support the growing industrial need for large money transactions, the State Bank issued &quot;Bearer&#x27;s Checks&quot; or &quot;State Bank Settlement Checks&quot; (&quot;Ngân Phiếu Thanh Toán&quot;) in denominations from 100,000 to 5,000,000 dong. To prevent counterfeiting, these notes had many degrees of protection, their designs were changed every five to six months, and they had expiration dates five or six months after the date of issue. The checks worked until the banking system was upgraded to handle electronic transfers of large amounts of &quot;đồng&quot;, making most large cash transactions unnecessary.

== Currency devaluation ==
In November 2009, the Vietnamese government decided to devalue the Vietnamese dong by 5% and at the same time raise interest rates to 8%. This was seen as a move that could destabilize the financial markets in Asia, as economies in the region were competing for an advantage over the European and American markets.

11 February 2010, The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) adjusted the interbank exchange rate between the Vietnamese dong (VND) and the US dollar (USD) to 18,544 VND/USD, a devaluation of 3.25% from the previous rate of 17,941 VND/USD. 17 August 2010, The SBV further devalued the VND by 2.04% to 18,932 VND/USD, an increase of 388 dong from the previous rate.

On 11 February 2011, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) announced a decision to increase the interbank exchange rate between USD and VND from 18,932 VND to 20,693 VND (a 9.3% increase). Along with that, the SBV also narrowed the applicable range for the exchange rates of commercial banks from ±3% to ±1%. However, by 19 February 2011, the USD exchange rate on the black market was 22,300 VND.

=== 2022 to 2024 ===
In response to increasing pressure on the Vietnamese dong as a result of high inflation in the US, on 17 October 2022, the decision was made to increase the dong&#x27;s trading band from 3 to 5 percent. As a result, from 16 October to 24 October the currency lost 2.98 percent of its value falling from 24,135 to 24,845 Vietnamese dong to the dollar. This decline has continued into 2024 with the dong losing about 4.5 percent of its value between 1 January 2024, and the end of July.

==Exchange rate==
After the revaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar on 1 August 2006, the dong became the least valued currency unit for months. Around 21 March 2007, the revalued Zimbabwean dollar regained least valued currency status (in terms of black market exchange rate), and on 7 September 2007 in terms of official exchange rate. After the use of the Zimbabwean dollar ceased on 12 April 2009, the dong was the second least valued currency unit after the Iranian rial as of 28 November 2014. Since 19 June 2014, the Vietnamese dong has been devalued a total of five times in an effort to help spur exports and to ensure the stability of the currency.

<doc id="875627" wikidata="Q1072143" url="?curid=875627" title="Interstate 474">
<text>Interstate 474 (I-474) is an Interstate Highway loop route that provides a southwestern bypass around the north-central Illinois city of Peoria. I-474&#x27;s parent Interstate is I-74. As the first digit of the Interstate&#x27;s number is even, it follows the established convention of providing a loop around a city. I-474 is long. I-474 is the highest numbered route in the state of Illinois. It is also, excluding the proposed I-274 in North Carolina, the only auxiliary route of I-74.

== Route description ==

I-474 is a modern, Interstate-standard four-lane freeway for its entire length. Prior to 2006, through truck traffic on I-74 was instructed to use I-474. This is because prior to its 2004–2007 reconstruction, I-74 was significantly below Interstate standard, having numerous on- and offramps, extremely short merging space for onramps (some less than in length), 

The Illinois Route 116 (IL 116) access interchange at Maxwell Road has been indicated as the eastern terminus for the Quincy to Peoria expressway now known as the IL 336 project.

The western terminus of I-474 is at I-74 exit 87A. The eastern terminus of I-474 is at I-74 exit 99. North of the western terminus, the road continues as IL 6 with a new series of exit numbers.

== History ==
I-474 was constructed through the mid-1970s. The now-named Shade–Lohmann Bridge was erected in 1973. During that year, $30.1 million (equivalent to $ in ) was allocated for acquisition of right-of-way, grading work, and overpass/bridge construction across the whole length of the highway.

<doc id="875628" wikidata="Q5150651" url="?curid=875628" title="Combat Medical Badge">
<text>The Combat Medical Badge is an award of the United States Army which was created in January 1945. Any member of the Army Medical Department, at the rank of colonel or below, who is assigned or attached to a ground combat arms unit of brigade or smaller size which provides medical support during any period in which the unit was engaged in ground combat is eligible for the CMB. According to the award criterion, the individual must be performing medical duties while simultaneously being engaged by the enemy; strict adherence to this requirement and its interpretation (e.g., distant mortar rounds vs. direct small arms fire) will vary by unit. As of 3 June 2005, Special Forces medics are no longer eligible for award, but may receive the Combat Infantryman Badge. A revision has allowed aviation medics to be eligible for the CMB. The non-combat proficiency equivalent is the Expert Field Medical Badge.

==Appearance==
The Combat Medical Badge is one inch tall and one and a half inches wide.
==History==
The Combat Medical Badge is retroactive to 6 December 1941. The original decoration was considered a one-time decoration, however this directive was rescinded in 1951 allowing for multiple awards of the Combat Medical Badge denoted by stars encircling the decoration. According to the US Army Medical Department Regiment, to date there have been only two soldiers that have earned the Combat Medical Badge with two stars: Henry Jenkins and Wayne Slagel. The directive was again altered in 1969 to specify that only one award of the Combat Medical Badge is authorized for service in &quot;the Vietnam Conflict Era&quot;, which included service in Vietnam and Laos, the Dominican Republic, and South Korea (subsequent to 4 January 1969). Current regulations have expanded this qualifying period to include service in El Salvador, Grenada, Panama, Southwest Asia, and Somalia, and have added an additional qualifying period (&quot;the Global War on Terror Era&quot;) covering service in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 1947, a policy was implemented that authorized the retroactive award of the Bronze Star to soldiers who had received the Combat Medical Badge during the Second World War. The basis for this regulation was that the Combat Medical Badge, like the Combat Infantryman Badge, was awarded only to soldiers who had borne combat duties befitting the Bronze Star Medal, and also that both the badge and medal required a recommendation by the unit commander and a citation in orders.
The CMB is authorized for award for the following qualifying
periods:

&quot;World War II Era&quot;
:1. World War II (7 December 1941 to 3 September 1945).

&quot;Korean War Era&quot;
:2. The Korean War (27 June 1950 to 27 July 1953).

&quot;Vietnam War Era&quot;
:3. Republic of Vietnam Conflict (2 March 1961 to 28 March 1973), combined with qualifying service in Laos (19 April 1961 to 6 October 1962).
:4. Dominican Republic (28 April 1965 to 1 September 1966).
:5. Korea on the DMZ (4 January 1969 to 31 March 1994).
:6. El Salvador (1 January 1981 to 1 February 1992).
:7. Grenada (23 October to 21 November 1983).
:8. Joint Security Area, Panmunjom, Korea (23 November 1984).
:9. Panama (20 December 1989 to 31 January 1990).
:10. Southwest Asia Conflict (17 January to 11 April 1991).
:11. Somalia (5 June 1992 to 31 March 1994).

&quot;Global War on Terror Era&quot;
:12. Afghanistan (Operations Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan and Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel, 5 December 2001 to 30 August 2021).
:13. Iraq (Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn, 19 March 2003 to 31 December 2011).

As of 2005 the rules for eligibility were changed to allow any medical department soldier in a brigade or lower unit to be eligible so long as they are engaged in actual ground combat and performed medical duties. This now includes Soldiers assigned to aviation units. Additionally, in 2008, IED/VBIEDs can now be considered direct contact with the enemy. 

As of June 2011, the badge and its sew-on equivalent may be worn on the Army Combat Uniform (ACU).

==Master Medical Badge==

In late 2024 it was reported that &quot;master combat badges&quot; would debut in Spring 2025; the Master Infantryman Badge, Master Medical Badge, and Master Soldier Badge. The badges would represent those who have earned both a combat badge (CIB, CMB, or CAB) and an expert badge (EIB, EFMB, or ESB). The proposed &quot;master badges&quot; are alleged to appear identical to their respective combat badges, replacing the silver wreaths on the full-color metal badges with gold wreaths; subdued pin-on badges and sew-on badges would see their black wreaths also replaced with gold. Soldiers that had earned a combat badge but a &quot;separate&quot; expert badge (a CIB and an EFMB, for example) would wear the master badge aligning with their combat badge (in the case of a CIB and an EFMB, the awardee would wear the Master Infantryman Badge). As of 03 2025, no official announcement has been made concerning the badges.

<text>Wolfhole Crag is an isolated and seldom-visited hill in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England. It has an elevation of and a prominence of . Its seclusion is due in part to its low profile and long approach walks. The East crag has a &#x27;Wolf hole&#x27; at the base of the south-facing side, presumably how it originally gained the name. Wolfhole Crag marks the northwesternmost boundary of the civil parish of Bowland Forest High, the historic Forest of Bowland, and the Lordship of Bowland.

A long path approaches from Ward&#x27;s Stone in the west which is fraught with bogs. Another tarmac path from Tarnbrook meets this halfway. A final path comes from the northeast from the Hornby Road in the direction to White Hill. The summit consists of two large (10m high) buttresses of gritstone, some unusually shaped waist-high rocks, and the usual trig point. The buttresses contain a number of recorded rock climbs, including the two farthest &quot;hard grit&quot; routes (E7 &amp; E6) from the road in the entire UK. Both climbs were ascended in 2001 by Neil Kershaw and Greg Chapman. It is quite possible to not see another human being all day there.

<text>Pozzuoli (; ; ) is a city and (municipality) of the Metropolitan City of Naples, in the Italian region of Campania. It is the main city of the Phlegrean Peninsula.

==History==
=== Antiquity ===

Pozzuoli began as the Greek colony of &quot;Dicaearchia&quot; () founded in about 531 BC in Magna Graecia with the consent of nearby Cumae when refugees from Samos escaped from the tyranny of Polycrates.

The Samnites occupied Dicaearchia in 421 BC after conquering Cumae and may have changed its name to Fistelia. It enjoyed considerable political and commercial autonomy favoured by the excellent position of its port with the Campanian hinterland. The Roman occupation of Campania after the end of the 1st Samnite War from 341 BC marked the start of the Romanisation of the Greek-Samnite city.

During the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), Rome recognised the strategic importance of the port of Puteoli and reinforced the defences and introduced a garrison to protect the town from Hannibal, who failed to capture it in 215. They made it a Roman colony from 195 BC.
The Roman conquest of the east and the need for a port to trade made it the Mediterranean port of Rome, even though it was 150 miles away. It took the name &quot;Puteoli&quot; whose roots are in the Latin (well or cistern). An alternative etymology of Puteoli derives from the Latin (to stink), referring to the sulfuric fumes in the area, most notably from Solfatara.

Puteoli became the great emporium for the Alexandrian grain ships and other ships from all over the Roman world. It also was the main hub for goods exported from Campania, including blown glass, mosaics, wrought iron, and marble. Lucilius wrote in about 125 BC that it was second only to Delos in importance, then the greatest harbour of the ancient world. Many inscriptions show that a polyglot population established companies (&quot;stationes&quot;) for trade and transport and formed professional guilds for arts, crafts and religious associations for foreign cults; they included Greeks from the islands and the coast of Asia, Jews and later Christians. Under the Roman Empire, it was the greatest emporium of foreign trade in all of Italy. Trade with Tyre was so important that the Tyrians established a factory there in 174 (C.I. no. 5853).

The Roman naval base at nearby Misenum housed the largest naval fleet in the ancient world. It was also the site of the Roman Dictator Sulla&#x27;s country villa and the place where he died in 78 BC. Cicero had a house in Puteoli and a villa nearby on the shore of the Lucrine Lake. Pliny mentions Puteoli as the site of a famed cochlearium created by Fulvius Hirpinus, known for raising exquisite snails.

The local volcanic sand, pozzolana (Latin: &quot;pulvis puteolanus&quot;, &quot;dust of Puteoli&quot;) was the basis for Roman concrete, which reacted chemically with water, turning the sand/lime mix into a mortar strong enough to bind lumps of aggregate into a load-bearing unit. This made it possible to construct the cupola of the Pantheon, which is still the world&#x27;s largest unreinforced concrete dome.

The apostle Paul landed in Pozzuoli on his way to Rome, away, stayed for seven days (&quot;Acts&quot; 28:13, 14), and then began with his companions his journey by the Appian Way to Rome. There was a Nabataean community in the city that built a sanctuary at the port; it likely ended in the early second century CE when the site was filled with concrete.

In 37 AD, Puteoli was the location for a political stunt by Emperor Gaius Caligula, who, on becoming Emperor, ordered a temporary floating bridge to be built using trading vessels, stretching for over two miles () from the town to the famous neighboring resort of Baiae, across which he proceeded to ride his horse, in defiance of an astrologer&#x27;s prediction that he had &quot;no more chance of becoming Emperor than of riding a horse across the Gulf of Baiae&quot;.

With the development of the port of Ostia begun by Claudius in 42 AD, completed by Nero in 54 and enlarged by Trajan between 100 and 106, the fortunes of Puteoli began to decline, although Antoninus Pius repaired the pier&#x27;s storm damage in 139. Nero&#x27;s abortive attempt to build the &quot;Fossa Neronis&quot; canal from Puteoli to Rome may have prolonged its life. As a reward for their support in the fight against Vitellius, Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) installed more veterans there, assigned the city a part of the Capuan territory and gave it the title &quot;Colonia Flavia&quot; which it retained.

Hadrian died at Baiae in 138 and was at Cicero&#x27;s villa at Puteoli, though his body was later transferred to Rome.

Two aqueducts eventually served Puteoli; the &quot;Campanian aqueduct&quot; dating from the 1st c. BC at the latest, and also the Aqua Augusta. Several cisterns still exist, including the very large Piscina di Cardito.

Saint Proculus (San Procolo) was martyred here with his companions in the fourth century, and is the city&#x27;s patron saint. The seven eagle heads on the coat of arms of the town of Pozzuoli are said to represent seven of these martyrs. November 16 was the official feast day for Saint Proculus. St Proculus was affectionately nicknamed &quot;″u pisciasotto&quot; (&quot;the pants-pisser&quot;) because November 16 was often a day of rain. The townspeople also celebrated his feast day on the second Sunday in May.

=== Late antiquity ===
The city was taken and plundered by Alaric I in 410, by Genseric in 455, and by Totila in 545, from which it took centuries to recover.

=== Modern era ===
Charles Lyell visited Pozzuoli in 1828 and studied the Macellum columns.

Since 1946, the town has been the home of the Accademia Aeronautica, the Italian Air Force Academy, which was first situated on the island of Nisida, then from 1962 on a purpose-built hilltop campus overlooking the bay.

From August 1982 to December 1984, the city experienced hundreds of tremors and bradyseismic activity, which peaked on 4 October 1983, damaging 8,000 buildings in the city centre and displacing 36,000 people, many permanently. The events raised the sea bottom by almost 2 m, and rendered the Bay of Pozzuoli too shallow for large craft. There was similar seismic activity in 2023.

==Main sights==

The town&#x27;s attractions include:
*Flavian Amphitheatre (Amphitheatrum Flavium), the third largest Italian amphitheatre after the Colosseum and the Capuan Amphitheatre. 
*The Macellum of Pozzuoli, also known as the &quot;Temple of Serapis&quot; or serapeum, is considered the city&#x27;s symbol. The &quot;temple&quot; was a marketplace. Its name derives from the misinterpretation of its function after a statue of the god Serapis was found in 1750. The Macellum includes three majestic columns in Cipollino marble, which show erosion from marine &quot;Lithophaga&quot; molluscs when, at an earlier time, the ground level was much lower due to Bradyseism, and sea-water could flow in.
*Temple of Augustus (part of the cathedral)
*Smaller Amphitheatre, very close to the Flavian one, its remains were absorbed by other buildings, but some arches can be seen by Via Solfatara and Via Vign
*Roman Baths, the so-called Temple of Neptune, are the remains of a big thermal complex now in Corso Terracciano, which also included the nearby &quot;Dianae Nymphaeum&quot;.

<doc id="875637" wikidata="Q2005041" url="?curid=875637" title="The Bad Sleep Well">
<text>is a 1960 Japanese neo-noir crime mystery film directed by Akira Kurosawa. It was the first film to be produced under Kurosawa&#x27;s own independent production company. It was entered into the 11th Berlin International Film Festival.

The film stars Toshiro Mifune as a young man who gets a prominent position in a corrupt postwar Japanese company in order to expose the men responsible for his father&#x27;s death. It draws upon Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet,&quot; while also doubling as a critique of corporate corruption. It is one of four films, along with &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; (1948), &quot;Stray Dog&quot; (1949) and &quot;High and Low&quot; (1963), in which Kurosawa explores the film noir genre. Like Kurosawa&#x27;s next two movies with Mifune, &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961) and &quot;Sanjuro&quot; (1962), Mifune&#x27;s character is &quot;a lone hero fighting against overwhelming odds and corrupt authorities.&quot;

==Plot==
A group of news reporters watch and gossip at an elaborate wedding reception held by the Public Development Corporation&#x27;s Vice President Iwabuchi, who married his daughter Yoshiko to his secretary Koichi Nishi. The police interrupt the wedding to arrest corporate assistant officer Wada, who is the reception&#x27;s master of ceremony, on charges of bribery in a kickback scheme. The reporters comment this incident is similar to an earlier scandal involving Iwabuchi, administrative officer Moriyama, and contract officer Shirai that was hushed up after the suicide of Assistant Chief Furuya, who had jumped from a seventh-story window of the corporate office building, which brought the investigation to a dead end, before any of the company&#x27;s higher-ups could be implicated. Following the wedding, the police question Wada and accountant Miura about bribery between Dairyu Construction Company and the government-funded Public Corporation.

Following the inquiry, Miura commits suicide by running in front of a truck when about to be arrested. Wada attempts to take his own life by jumping into an active volcano. But Nishi, pursuing Wada, stops the suicide attempt. To convince Wada to help him and his best friend Itakura in their agenda of revenge, Nishi then drives Wada where they both are shown spying on the (pre-scripted) funeral, that reveals to Wada what his employers thought of him. Nishi then focuses his efforts on contract officer Shirai by setting him up so that Iwabuchi and Moriyama believe him to be stealing from them, while also using Wada to drive him insane with guilt. Nishi then saves Shirai from an assassin hired by Iwabuchi before taking him to the office where Furuya died, revealing himself as Furuya&#x27;s illegitimate son who exchanged identities with Itakura to avenge his father&#x27;s death. Nishi&#x27;s interrogation methods shatter what little sanity Shirai had left, with Moriyama deducing that someone connected to Furuya is orchestrating these events as he soon learns the truth about Nishi and informs Iwabuchi. Iwabuchi&#x27;s son Tatsuo overhears and angrily drives Nishi off when he returns to the house.

Retreating to the ruins of a factory he worked at during World War II, Nishi manages to abduct Moriyama and starves him into revealing the location of evidence he can use to expose the corruption and all involved to the press. In the meantime, Wada slips away and brings back Yoshiko in the hopes that the newlyweds will reconcile. Nishi tells his wife that he has grown to truly love her. Yoshiko accepts the truth about her father&#x27;s evil deeds and reluctantly agrees to allow Nishi to complete his plans to expose him. But as Nishi calls for a press conference to be held the next day and prepares to retrieve the final evidence, Iwabuchi deduces Yoshiko saw Nishi and tricks her by claiming Tatsuo intends to kill Nishi while promising to turn himself in. She offers to go with Iwabuchi, but he drugs his daughter with wine laced with sleeping pills.

Yoshiko comes to by the time Tatsuo returns home from duck hunting, realizing her father tricked her as they rush to Nishi&#x27;s location. But they are too late, Itakura revealing that Nishi had been killed, with his murder made to look as though he’d crashed while driving drunk. He also reveals that Wada, Moriyama, and the evidence have all been disposed of. All three are devastated by this development, knowing the truth but having nothing to back up their story. After canceling Nishi&#x27;s conference, Iwabuchi&#x27;s children confront him and disown him. Iwabuchi receives a call from his superior and apologizes for the recent trouble while assuring them that he handled it. He then requests retirement, but his superior advises him to take a vacation. Iwabuchi proceeds to hang up after apologizing, as he lost his sense of time from having not slept at all the previous night.

==Cast==
==Production==
After Toho Studios had grown frustrated with Kurosawa going overbudget during filming of &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, in 1959 the director formed his own film company, Kurosawa Productions. Believing that making his first independent film merely for commercial success would be insulting to the audience, Kurosawa elected to tackle a subject of social significance.

The idea for &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; came from Kurosawa&#x27;s nephew Yoshio Inoue, whose story called &quot;Bad Men&#x27;s Prosperity&quot; was used as the basis for Kurosawa&#x27;s draft. Kurosawa began writing the script with Eijirō Hisaita, whom he had collaborated with on &quot;No Regrets for Our Youth&quot; and &quot;The Idiot&quot;, both starring Setsuko Hara. Kurosawa&#x27;s other writing collaborators Hideo Oguni, Ryūzō Kikushima and Shinobu Hashimoto would later join Kurosawa and Hisaita in the writing process once they were free from other projects. The process of writing the script took 80 days, with the script being carefully written to not resemble actual real-life cases of corruption in Japan.

Filming began in March 22, 1960, with the Navy Yard of Toyohashi, Mount Aso, Marunouchi Building and the Yokohama Prison serving as main locations for the film. To convincingly play the part of a disabled wife, Kyōko Kagawa used uneven shoes and a knee brace. During filming of a car scene, Kagawa suffered injuries in her face and considered quitting her acting career. At the hospital where she was being treated, Toshiro Mifune stopped the press from interviewing her by standing in front of the door to her room.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were positive, with a Bosley Crowther piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from January 1963 calling it ”an aggressive and chilling drama of modern-day Japan” which ”gives to an ordinary tale of greedy and murderous contention a certain basic philosophical tone”. It praises Kurosawa for staging ”what amounts to cliches in this type of strongarm fiction in a way that makes them seem fresh and as fully of sardonic humor as though we had never seen their likes before”. Dan Schneider considers it one of Kurosawa’s finest movies.

The most common criticism of the film among professional reviewers refers to the ending. In a 2006 review of the Criterion Collection DVD release, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Keith Phipps calls it &quot;an assured, muscular Kurosawa film [...] that it&#x27;s all the more disappointing when a shapeless, anticlimactic, but probably inevitable ending does it in&quot;.

At the 14th Mainichi Film Awards, Masayuki Mori and Masaru Sato won the awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Music.

American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola has listed &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; as one of his favorite films, citing the first thirty minutes of the film &quot;as perfect as any film I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; and used it as inspiration for the wedding sequence in the 1972 Oscar-winning gangster drama &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

<doc id="875638" wikidata="Q4857189" url="?curid=875638" title="Bantamwork">
<text>Bantamwork in 18th century England signified a particular style of export lacquerware which was cut into a layer of gesso and then lacquered in colors.

==History==

By the mid-17th century, trade with China and Japan had flourished in Europe. Oriental curiosities included lacquered cabinets and screens. The beautiful lacquer and were highly prized. One of many Chinese lacquer was known as &quot;Coromandel&quot; or &quot;bantomwork&quot;. It is assumed that it is named after Bantam in Java, which used to play an important part in the export of oriental crafts to Europe.

==Oriental Process==
The sap of the &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot; tree, indigenous to China, was used on the pieces. Once the sap had dried, it could be applied in coats, forming a hard crust. This crust could be carved in relief. Color could be added to the sap, usually red, black and aubergine, to add variety to the pieces.

==European Process==
True Oriental lacquer could not be produced in Europe, because the Rhus vernicifera tree was not grown in Europe. An imitation based on shellac made from insect secretions was developed. This was known as &quot;japanning&quot;. Japanning, using white, blue and green as well as the traditional colors, is used still today.

<doc id="875647" wikidata="Q4917800" url="?curid=875647" title="Bishop of Chelmsford">
<text>The Bishop of Chelmsford is the Ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Chelmsford in the Province of Canterbury.

The current bishop is Guli Francis-Dehqani, since the confirmation of her election on 11 March 2021.

==History==
The diocese was founded in 1914 under George V from the Diocese of Saint Albans (of which it had been a part since 1877).

The present diocese covers the County of Essex including those parts of Essex added to Greater London on 1 April 1965 and Ballingdon-with-Brundon, transferred to Suffolk and Great/Little Chishill and Heydon, transferred to Cambridgeshire in 1894. The see is in the city of Chelmsford where the seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Mary, Saint Peter and Saint Cedd which was elevated to cathedral status in 1914. The bishop&#x27;s residence is Bishopscourt, Margaretting.

==List of bishops==
==Assistant bishops==

Assistant bishops of the diocese have included:
*19611966 (res.): Geoffrey Stuart Smith was an assistant bishop; he was also Rector of Danbury from 1960.
*19721974: Br John-Charles SSF, former Assistant Bishop of Adelaide and Bishop of Polynesia

The appointment of Cecil de Carteret, Bishop of Jamaica, to be an assistant bishop was announced in 1931, but he died before he could take it up.

Saulo Mauricio de Barros has been Priest-in-Charge of St Martin&#x27;s Church, Plaistow since 2024. Barros was born in Arcoverde, Brazil; he was made deacon in 1995 and ordained priest in 1996. Having served in the Diocese of Recife, he was sent to the then-Missionary District of the Amazon in 2002, becoming the bishop of the area as it became a full diocese. He was consecrated a bishop on 14 October 2006, the same day his diocese was inaugurated. Having resigned as bishop, Barros served for a few years in southwestern Brazil before moving to his wife&#x27;s native Britain, arriving in Colchester in 2019. He became Associate Priest of the Luso-Hispanic Mission at St Martin&#x27;s Plaistow and of East Ham Team Ministry in September 2022; in late 2023, he was also licensed as an honorary assistant bishop of the Diocese of Chelmsford.

<doc id="875650" wikidata="Q308229" url="?curid=875650" title="Currency symbol">
<text>A currency symbol or currency sign is a graphic symbol used to denote a currency unit. Usually it is defined by a monetary authority, such as the national central bank for the currency concerned.

A symbol may be positioned in various ways, according to national convention: before, between or after the numeric amounts: , and .

Symbols are neither defined nor listed by international standard ISO 4217, which only assigns three-letter codes.

==Usage==
When writing currency amounts, the location of the symbol varies by language. For currencies in English-speaking countries and in most of Latin America, the symbol is placed before the amount, as in . In most other countries, including many in Europe and Canada (when using French), the symbol is placed after the amount, as in . Exceptionally, the symbol for the Cape Verdean escudo (like the Portuguese escudo, to which it was formerly pegged) is placed in the decimal separator position, as in .

==Design==

Older currency symbols have evolved slowly, often from previous currencies. The modern dollar and peso symbols originated from the mark employed to denote the Spanish dollar, whereas the pound and lira symbols evolved from the letter L (written until the seventeenth century in blackletter type as formula_1) standing for , a Roman pound of silver.

Newly invented currencies and currencies adopting new symbols have symbolism meaningful to their adopter. For example, the euro sign is based on , an archaic form of the Greek epsilon, to represent Europe; the Indian rupee sign is a blend of the Latin letter &#x27;R&#x27; with the Devanagari letter (ra); and the Russian Ruble sign is based on (the Cyrillic capital letter &#x27;er&#x27;).

There are other considerations, such as how the symbol is rendered on computers and typesetting. For a new symbol to be used, its glyphs needs to be added to computer fonts and keyboard mappings already in widespread use, and keyboard layouts need to be altered or shortcuts added to type the new symbol. For example, the European Commission was criticized for not considering how the euro sign would need to be customized to work in different fonts. The original design was also exceptionally wide. These two factors have led to most type foundries designing customized versions that match the &#x27;look and feel&#x27; of the font to which it is to be added, often with reduced width.

<doc id="875651" wikidata="Q4917819" url="?curid=875651" title="Bishop of Coventry">
<text>The Bishop of Coventry is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Coventry in the Province of Canterbury. In the Middle Ages, the Bishop of Coventry was a title used by the bishops known today as the Bishop of Lichfield. 

The present diocese covers most of the County of Warwickshire. The see is in the City of Coventry where the bishop&#x27;s seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Michael. The Bishop&#x27;s residence is Bishop&#x27;s House, Coventry.

==History==

From 1102 to 1238, the former Benedictine Priory and Cathedral of St Mary in the city was the seat of the early Bishops of Coventry (previously known as Bishops of Chester or of Lichfield). It was, afterwards, one of the two seats of the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield until the Reformation of the 1530s when Coventry (St Mary&#x27;s) Cathedral was demolished and the bishop&#x27;s seat moved to Lichfield, though the title remained as Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry until 1837, when Coventry was united with the Diocese of Worcester.

==Bishops of the modern diocese==
The diocese was revived in 1918 under King George V when the parish church of Saint Michael was elevated to cathedral status. The cathedral suffered under fire-bombing by the Luftwaffe on the night of 14 November 1940 and remains today as a dignified ruin adjacent to the new cathedral building consecrated on 25 May 1962. The 8th Bishop of Coventry was Colin Bennetts, who retired on 31 January 2008.

Christopher Cocksworth resigned as Bishop of Coventry effective 5 November 2023, to become Dean of Windsor. Because the suffragan See of Warwick is also vacant, so Ruth Worsley (Bishop of Taunton in the Diocese of Bath and Wells) has been seconded part-time as Acting Bishop of Coventry since 6 November.

On 4 November 2024, it was announced that Sophie Jelley, Bishop of Doncaster, had been appointed as the next Bishop of Coventry, to take up the position in spring 2025. She legally became Bishop by the confirmation of her election on 14 February 2025.

==List of bishops==
==Assistant bishops==
Among those who have served as assistant bishops of the diocese have been:
*1937–1952: Richard Heywood, retired Bishop of Mombasa
*1952–1959: Nathaniel Newnham Davis, Rector of Ladbroke and former Bishop of Antigua
*1960–1980: John McKie, Rector of Berkswell (until 1966), Vicar of Great and Little Packington (from 1966) and former Bishop of Geelong
*1968–1975 (ret.): John Daly, Priest-in-charge of Honington with Idlicote and Whatcote (until 1970), Vicar of Bishop&#x27;s Tachbrook thereafter; former Bishop of Gambia and the Rio Pongas, of Accra, in Korea and of Taejon
*November 2023–present: Saju Muthalaly, Bishop of Loughborough, is also serving part-time as an Assistant Bishop supporting the Acting Bishop one day a week

<text>Parlick (also known as Parlick Pike) is an approximately cone-shaped steep-sided hill at the extreme south of the main range of Bowland fells in Lancashire, England. Its bog-free sides make it more popular with walkers than the shallow boggy hills to its north. Paths zigzag up this hill from the south, or for the more strenuous ascent a straight path can be chosen. This hill is usually green — different from the often thorny brown to red of the northern hills. A thin neck joins Parlick onto Fair Snape Fell with well-worn paths linking the two.

Regarding the origin of the name, Professor Eilert Ekwall, in his 1922 &quot;The Place-names of Lancashire&quot;, writes:
:&quot;.. (caput de) Pirloc 1228 C1R, Perlak 1228 WhC 371, Pireloke 1338 LPR, Pyrelok pyke c 1350 ib. The name cannot mean &quot; pear orchard &quot; as Wyld suggests. But the etymology may be correct with a slight amendment. O.E. loc means &quot; fold for sheep or goats.&quot; A sheep fold at which grew a peartree (O.E. pyrige) may very well have been at the foot of or on the slope of the hill; this may have been called Parlick (Pirloc) and have given the hill its name. For a probable earlier name see under Core, p. 143.&quot;

Parlick is a popular venue for foot-launched gliders, because it produces good ridge lift in an unusually wide variety of wind directions. The extensive west-facing bowl allows paraglider pilots to fly to Fair Snape Fell and beyond without leaving reliable ridge lift and as far forwards as Beacon Fell. Local pilots use this arena for club competitions, such as the &#x27;Parlick Grid Challenge&#x27; 

The summit consists of little more than a cairn, leaving the walker to look at the view, south to Preston and Winter Hill near Chorley, east toward Pendle Hill, and west towards Blackpool and the Irish Sea.

The boundary between the boroughs of Wyre and Ribble Valley passes very close to the summit, with half of the hill lying within each borough.

&quot;Parlick Fell&quot; is the name of a cheese made in Longridge from sheep&#x27;s milk from the area.

The hill and its environs are the location of the legend of the enormous Dun Cow, which was reputed to wander freely across the moorland, and to be in the habit of quenching its thirst at &quot;Nick&#x27;s Water-Pot&quot;, a well on the summit of Parlick.

<text>Howard Barraclough Fell (June 6, 1917 – April 21, 1994), better known as Barry Fell, was a professor of invertebrate zoology at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. While his primary professional research included starfish and sea urchins, Fell is best known for his pseudoarchaeological work in New World epigraphy, arguing that various inscriptions in the Americas are best explained by extensive pre-Columbian contact with Old World civilizations. His writings on epigraphy and archaeology are generally rejected by those mainstream scholars who have considered them.

==Biography==
Fell was born in Lewes, Sussex, England, and was a grandson of the railway engineer and inventor John Barraclough Fell. He moved with his mother to New Zealand in the early 1920s after his father, who was a merchant seaman, died in a shipboard fire.

He returned to the British Isles for graduate work, receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Edinburgh in 1941. Fell then served with the British Army during World War II. In 1946 he returned to New Zealand, where he resumed his academic career, and lectured in zoology at Victoria University of Wellington.

A world authority on fossil sea urchins, he supervised a number of students including Helen E.S. Clark and they published a number of studies on Antarctic seastars. He was recruited by Harvard University in 1964, and emigrated to the United States to join the staff of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard where he worked until retirement in 1979.

He died of heart failure in San Diego, California, aged 77, while discussing a new book with his publisher.

==Epigraphy==
Although Fell was an accomplished marine biologist at Harvard University, he is best known for three books, mostly written after retirement, which claim that many centuries before Christopher Columbus reached America, Celts, Basques, Phoenicians, Egyptians, and others were visiting North America.

His interest in inscriptions began early in his career with a study of Polynesian petroglyphs published in 1940, but his most famous work came much later, starting in 1976 with his publication of &quot;America B.C.&quot;, in which he proposed translations of inscriptions found on rock surfaces and artifacts in North and South America which he believed to be written in Old World scripts and languages. He followed up this work in 1980 with &quot;Saga America&quot; and in 1982 with &quot;Bronze Age America&quot;.

Fell&#x27;s epigraphic work was not well received in academia. Critics of Fell&#x27;s work routinely dismissed him as an amateur, pointing out his lack of formal training in ancient scripts and languages.

A scholarly response to Fell&#x27;s work was prepared by Ives Goddard and William W. Fitzhugh of the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution. They stated, in 1978, that &quot;the arguments of &quot;America B.C.&quot; are unconvincing. The only accepted case of pre-Columbian European contact in North America remains the Norse site of L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfoundland. Perhaps some day credible proof of other early European contacts will be discovered in the New World. However, &quot;America B.C.&quot; does not contain such proof and does not employ the standard linguistic and archeological methods that would be necessary to convince specialists in these fields.&quot;

One example of Fell&#x27;s claims is his contention in &quot;Saga America&quot; that Brendan of Clonfert may have reached North America centuries before Columbus. This is based on Fell&#x27;s translation, published in the magazine &quot;Wonderful West Virginia&quot; in 1983, of two rock-cut inscriptions located at archaeological sites in Wyoming and Boone counties, West Virginia. According to Fell, these inscriptions narrate the story of Christ&#x27;s nativity and are written in an old Irish script called Ogham, dating back to the 6th or 8th century AD. This led to the publication of articles in the journal &quot;The West Virginia Archeologist&quot; that were highly critical of Fell&#x27;s conclusions and methodology, including a 1983 article by archaeologist and historian W. Hunter Lesser describing Fell&#x27;s claims as pseudoscientific and unreliable. In 1989 lawyers Monroe Oppenheimer and Willard Wirtz wrote an article based on opinions of academic archaeologists and linguists to dispute that the inscription is written in Ogham script. They further accused Fell of deliberate fraud.

David H. Kelley, an archaeologist at the University of Calgary who is credited with a major breakthrough in the decipherment of Mayan glyphs, complained about Fell in a 1990 essay: &quot;Fell&#x27;s work [contains] major academic sins, the three worst being distortion of data, inadequate acknowledgment of predecessors, and lack of presentation of alternative views.&quot; In the same essay, however, Kelley went on to state that &quot;I have no personal doubts that some of the inscriptions which have been reported are genuine Celtic ogham.&quot; Kelley concluded: &quot;Despite my occasional harsh criticism of Fell&#x27;s treatment of individual inscriptions, it should be recognized that without Fell&#x27;s work there would be no [North American] &quot;ogham&quot; problem to perplex us. We need to ask not only what Fell has done wrong in his epigraphy, but also where we have gone wrong as archaeologists in not recognizing such an extensive European presence in the New World.&quot;

==Archaeology survey==

A survey of 340 teaching archaeologists in 1983, showed 95.7% had a &quot;negative&quot; view of Barry Fell&#x27;s claims (considering them pseudo-archaeology), 2.9% had a &quot;neutral&quot; view, and only 1.4% (5) had a &quot;positive&quot; view (regarding them as factual).

<text>The MAT-49 is a submachine gun which was developed by the French arms factory Manufacture Nationale d&#x27;Armes de Tulle (MAT) for use by the French Army. It was first produced in 1949 and remained in French service until it was phased out following the adoption of the FAMAS assault rifle in 1979.

==Development==
In 1949, after evaluating several other submachine gun prototypes (including a collapsible design from Hotchkiss), the French MAT factory began production of the MAT-49 9×19mm Parabellum submachine gun. The MAT-49 used a machine stamping process which allowed for the economical production of large numbers of submachine guns, then urgently required by the French Government for use by Army, French Foreign Legion as well as airborne and colonial forces to meet the need for a compact weapon.

Production continued at MAT until the mid-1960s, then switched to the Manufacture d&#x27;armes de Saint-Étienne plant (MAS), where the weapon was produced until 1973. In 1979, the French armed forces adopted the FAMAS 5.56 mm NATO assault rifle, and the MAT-49 was gradually phased out of service.

==Usage==

The MAT-49 saw widespread combat use during the First Indochina War and the Algerian War, as well as the 1956 Suez Crisis. The weapon found considerable favor with airborne forces and mechanized troops, who prized it for its simplicity, ruggedness, firepower and compactness.

After French forces left Indochina, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and Viet Minh continued to use many captured MAT-49s into the Vietnam War. Some were converted to the Soviet 7.62 mm Tokarev pistol cartridge, then available in large quantities from the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. These converted versions could be distinguished by a longer barrel and a higher rate of fire at 900 rpm.

North Vietnam covertly provided MAT-49s to anti-French occupation groups during the Algerian War after the French left Indochina.

==Overview==
The MAT-49 had a short, retractable wire stock, which when extended gave the weapon a length of , and the magazine well and magazine could be folded forward parallel to the barrel for parachute jump or with a 45° angle hence allowing a safe carry until the magazine well is brought back to vertical position before opening fire. Barrel length is , with the MAT-49/54 manufactured with extended barrels and non-retractable wooden stocks. As issued, the MAT-49 fires a 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, using a single-column 20-round magazine for desert use or 32-round similar to the Sten magazine.

The MAT-49 is blowback-operated and box magazine-fed, with a cyclic rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute. Some of the MAT 49/54s, modified MAT-49s manufactured for police forces, had two triggers, allowing use of full-auto fire or single shots, but most were manufactured as full-auto only. Minus magazine, the MAT-49 weighs about , which is heavy for a submachine gun. The weapon incorporates a grip safety which is located on the backside of the pistol grip. The rear sights are flip-up and L-shaped, and marked for a range of . Production ceased before the introduction of the FAMAS assault rifle in 1979.

==Variants==
*MAS-48 - prototype variant.
*MAT-49 - main variant.
*MAT-49/54 - gendarme variant with extended barrel and fixed wooden stock with a sling bar.
*MAT-49 silenced - variant fitted with a suppressor.
*MAT-49 M - variant modified by the Viet Minh, firing in 7.62×25mm Tokarev. It had a longer barrel, modified 35-round magazine, and a higher rate of fire (900 rpm). It was distinguished from the 9mm version by having a letter &quot;K&quot; stamped on the top of the receiver&#x27;s endcap and the side of the compatible magazines. Spare parts were still produced in the early 1970s, the gun being used by the Viet Cong.

<text>The 2002 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election was a leadership election called in the fall of 2001 when Ontario Progressive Conservative Party Premier Mike Harris announced his intention to resign.

The candidates to succeed Harris were Elizabeth Witmer, Tony Clement, Ernie Eves, Jim Flaherty and Chris Stockwell. Eves was not initially a candidate, but was persuaded to join the race by senior Tories who felt none of the other candidates could win a provincial election.

Witmer and Eves sought to distance the party from Harris&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; agenda. Eves began his campaign with a speech in which he said he was neither left wing nor right wing. He later said that the government should not be giving tax credits to parents who send their children to private schools unless the schools teach the government curriculum. This policy had been introduced by Flaherty as Minister of Finance. These and other comments led Harris loyalist Jim Flaherty to launch a number of publicity stunts against Eves, whose &quot;de facto&quot; rejection of the Common Sense Revolution had made him the early front-runner. Flaherty referred to Eves as a &quot;serial waffler&quot; and as &quot;a pale-pink imitation of Dalton McGuinty.&quot; Eves was dogged on the campaign trail by a pink waffle and a pink panther, courtesy of the Flaherty campaign. Flaherty, for his part, caught flack in the media for proposing to take the homeless off the streets by force on cold winter nights. During the campaign, Clement effectively blamed Flaherty for bringing to the fore news about Clement&#x27;s wife, a lawyer, who was alleged to take a pro-choice view of abortion. Eves - who had the backing of almost all PC Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) - won the campaign.

For the vote a modified &quot;One Member One Vote&quot; system was used in which all ridings in the province were accorded 100 points which were distributed among the candidate in proportion to the number of votes each received in that riding. If no candidate won a majority on the first ballot, a second ballot would be held later the same day with balloting continuing until one candidate had a majority.

The vote was held on March 23, 2002.

The results of the first ballot were:

First ballot:

*Ernie Eves 4,257 points (41.3%)
*Jim Flaherty 3,031 points (29%)
*Tony Clement 1,354 points (13.2%)
*Elizabeth Witmer 1,197 points (11.6%)
*Chris Stockwell 448 points (4%)

Stockwell, having the fewest votes, was forced to withdraw. Clement and Witmer announced their withdrawal to support Eves, however, their announcement came too late to remove their names from the ballot.

Second ballot:

*[[Ernie Eves]] 5,623 points (54.6%)
*Jim Flaherty 3,898 points (37.8%)
*Tony Clement 561 points (5.4%)
*Elizabeth Witmer 216 points (2.1%)

(44,188 party members voted on the first ballot, 34,608 on the second.)

One problem with the procedure was that voters were expected to remain in voting centres throughout the province for hours if they wanted to cast ballots in both rounds of voting. Many did not wish to do so, or could not do so, and left after casting their first ballot vote. As a result, in the 2004 PC leadership election, voters voted only once using a preferential ballot, in which they ranked the candidates by preference, rather than vote in separate rounds.

<text>Jacob Leib Talmon (; June 14, 1916 – June 16, 1980) was Professor of Modern History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

He studied the genealogy of totalitarianism, arguing that political Messianism stemmed from the French Revolution, and stressed the similarities between Jacobinism and Stalinism. He coined the terms &quot;totalitarian democracy&quot; and &quot;Messianic democracy/political Messianism&quot;.

==Biography==
Talmon was born in Rypin, a town in central Poland, into an Orthodox Jewish family. He left in 1934 to study at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, then in the British Mandate of Palestine, now Israel. He continued his studies in France but left for London after the Nazi invasion; in 1943 he was awarded a PhD from the London School of Economics. His main works are &quot;The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy&quot; and &quot;Political Messianism: The Romantic Phase&quot;. Talmon argued that Rousseau&#x27;s position may best be understood as &quot;totalitarian democracy&quot;, a philosophy in which liberty is realized &quot;only in the pursuit and attainment of an absolute collective purpose.&quot; Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Talmon engaged in a debate with Arnold J. Toynbee on the role of Jews and Zionism in history.

Talmon died in Jerusalem on June 16, 1980, two days after his 64th birthday.

==Awards==
In 1957, Talmon was awarded the Israel Prize for social sciences.

<doc id="875676" wikidata="Q1023887" url="?curid=875676" title="Colossal magnetoresistance">
<text>Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is a property of some materials, mostly manganese-based perovskite oxides, that enables them to dramatically change their electrical resistance in the presence of a magnetic field. The magnetoresistance of conventional materials enables changes in resistance of up to 5%, but materials featuring CMR may demonstrate resistance changes by orders of magnitude.

This technology may find uses in disk read-and-write heads, allowing for increases in hard disk drive data density. However, so far it has not led to practical applications because it requires low temperatures and bulky equipment.

== History ==
Initially discovered in mixed-valence perovskite manganites in the 1950s by G. H. Jonker and J. H. van Santen, a first theoretical description in terms of the double-exchange mechanism was given early on. In this model, the spin orientation of adjacent Mn moments is associated with kinetic exchange of eg-electrons. Consequently, alignment of the Mn spins by an external magnetic field causes higher conductivity. Relevant experimental work was done by Volger, Wollan and Koehler, and later on by Jirak et al. and Pollert et al.

However, the double exchange model did not adequately explain the high insulating-like resistivity above the transition temperature. In the 1990s, work by R. von Helmolt et al. and Jin et al. initiated a large number of further studies. Although there is still no complete understanding of the phenomenon, there is a variety of theoretical and experimental work providing a deeper understanding of the relevant effects.

== Theory ==
One prominent model is the so-called &quot;half-metallic ferromagnetic model&quot;, which is based on spin-polarized (SP) band structure calculations using the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) of the density functional theory (DFT) where separate calculations are carried out for spin-up and spin-down electrons. The half-metallic state is concurrent with the existence of a metallic majority spin band and a nonmetallic minority spin band in the ferromagnetic phase.

This model is not the same as the Stoner Model of itinerant ferromagnetism. In the Stoner model, a high density of states at the Fermi level makes the nonmagnetic state unstable. In SP calculations of covalent ferromagnets using DFT-LSDA functionals, the exchange-correlation integral takes the place of the Stoner parameter. The density of states at the Fermi level does not play a special role. A significant advantage of the half-metallic model is that it does not rely on the presence of mixed valency as does the double exchange mechanism and it can therefore explain the observation of CMR in stoichiometric phases like the pyrochlore . Microstructural effects in polycrystalline samples have also been investigated and it has been found that the magnetoresistance is often dominated by the tunneling of spin-polarized electrons between grains, resulting in the magnetoresistance having an intrinsic dependence on grain size.

A fully quantitative understanding of the CMR effect remains elusive and it is still the subject of much current research. Early promises of the development of new CMR-based technologies have not yet come to fruition.

<text>The Bishop of St Albans is the Ordinary of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of St Albans in the Province of Canterbury. The bishop is supported in his work by two suffragan bishops, the Bishop of Hertford and the Bishop of Bedford, and three archdeacons.

The diocese covers the counties of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, as well as parts of the London Borough of Barnet. The see is in the City of St Albans in Hertfordshire, where the cathedra (bishop&#x27;s seat) is located at St Albans Cathedral. The cathedral building itself was an abbey church (part of St Albans Abbey) prior to the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Following its purchase by the town in 1553, it was then a parish church until its elevation to cathedral status in 1877, when the diocese was created from the diocese of Rochester under Queen Victoria by the Bishopric of St. Albans Act 1875.

==Incumbent==
The current incumbent is Alan Smith, 10th Bishop of St Albans, who signs &quot;+ Alan St Albans&quot;. His nomination was announced by Downing Street on 13 January 2009, following the retirement of Christopher Herbert. Smith&#x27;s election as bishop by the College of Canons of the Cathedral took place on 13 February and his Confirmation of Election with the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams followed on 31 March, at which point he legally took office as bishop. Smith was enthroned on 19 September 2009.

The Bishop&#x27;s residence is the Abbey Gate House, St Albans.

==List of bishops==
==Assistant bishops==
Among those who have served as assistant bishops in the diocese are:
*19141924 (ret.): Noel Hodges, former Bishop of Travancore and Cochin and Assistant Bishop of Durham and of Ely
*19241934 (d.): Gerard Lander, Vicar of Holy Trinity New Barnet (until 1933), Archdeacon of Bedford (after 1933), and former Bishop of Victoria
*19421951 (ret.): Bernard Heywood, Canon Residentiary of St Albans Abbey and retired Bishop of Ely
*1961–1968 (res.): John Boys, Canon of St Albans and former Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman

<doc id="875684" wikidata="Q6745081" url="?curid=875684" title="Malvern Link">
<text>Malvern Link is an area in the civil parish of Malvern, in the Malvern Hills District, in Worcestershire, England to the north and east of Great Malvern. The centres of Malvern Link and Great Malvern are separated by Link Common, an area of open land that is statutorily protected by the Malvern Hills Conservators. The population of Link ward in 2022 was 6,301.

==Etymology==
The place-name &quot;Link&quot; is first attested in 1215, in forms such as &quot;Link&quot; and &quot;Linche&quot;, and the partly French forms &quot;La Lynke&quot; and &quot;La Lynche&quot;. The name derives from the Old English word (&quot;a ridge of land, bank&quot;) and must previously have denoted the outlying ridge of the Malvern Hills on which it is situated.

A popular folk tale about the origin of the name is that it arose because the Victorians used to link up more horses to the carriages so that they could be pulled up the hill on the A449, which runs through the centre of Malvern Link to the small urban centre of Link Top at its western end before arriving in the town centre of Great Malvern. At the point where the A449 road passes through Malvern Link it is called Worcester Road, as it leads directly into the centre of the city of Worcester about six miles to the north east.

==Location==
The main urban area is to the north of the Worcester Road and the Link Common that marks a sharply defined boundary on the south of the settlement between the railway station and the area&#x27;s western limit at Newtown Road in Link Top. The urban development takes a gentle transition through the neighbourhoods of Upper Howsell and Lower Howsell to the farms and communities of Leigh Sinton in the north and Newland and Madresfield in the west. To the south along the main axis of Pickersleigh Road, an unbroken built up area merges seamlessly into Barnards Green, a suburb of the former independent town of Great Malvern.

==History==
===Ancient and medieval===
Malvern Link was the key site of the Romano-British pottery industry that produced Severn Valley Ware. There are several kilns in the Malvern Link-Newland area and numerous water-filled clay pits, now lined with trees.

According to Brian S. Smith, &quot;The many local placenames ... which first appear in thirteenth century records were probably current a full century earlier. ... By 1276 ... there was, therefore, a probable population of at least 200 scattered in the old hamlets of Baldenhall, Guarlford, Poolbrook and the Link ...&quot;

===The Link Stone===
A perambulation of the boundaries of the Malvern Chase in 1584 describes &quot;a great Stone in a Tufte of bushes&quot; at Link Top which was recorded on a Stuart map as the &quot;Whore Stone&quot; (meaning or ancient stone).
In 1744 the Link Stone was located at the beginning of Pickersleigh road. It has since been relocated to the St Matthias churchyard.

An inscription on a plaque near the stone reads:

This stone originally marked the boundary between the Manors of Leigh and Powick. It was already old in 1584 when a breathless Elizabethan gentleman noted it during &quot;beating the bounds&quot;. In the Stuart period it was marked on an estate map as the &quot;Old Stone&quot;. The central recess is a receptacle for coins perpetuating the very old custom of receiving payment for the right of passage through the parish. This custom was acknowledged by mourners, who would rest a coffin on the Link Stone on its way to Leigh from the Pickersleigh side of the Link, a practice probably not discontinued until 1846 when St Matthias was consecrated.

===Twentieth-century development===
Malvern Link is the location of the majority of Malvern&#x27;s council and private housing estates, and retail parks and factory centres that have emerged since the 1950s. The expansion in the second half of the 19th century began essentially as ribbon development along the Worcester Road, the eastern approach to Malvern, at the same time as Malvern&#x27;s rise to popularity as a Spa Town. When the railway arrived in the mid 19th century, the settlement had reached sufficient dimensions to justify its own fully featured station although the Great Malvern station is only about one mile further down the line. Large villas and small hotels were constructed along the entire length of the northern side of the Worcester Road, from the railway station to Link Top affording them an unhindered view over the Malvern Common and many of them were converted to boarding schools following the decline of the spa industry, and major middle class residential areas developed northwards during the inter-war years of the 1920s and 1930s.

==Population==
As with the rest of Malvern, the Link owes much of its development to the area&#x27;s rapid expansion from a cluster of hamlets and manors to a busy spa town during the mid 19th century. In 1942 the population swelled again when the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) relocated to Malvern to occupy a site at Barnards Green, and a further site of the RAF Radio Training School on the location of the former Pale Manor Farm in Leigh Sinton Road in Malvern Link, that came to be known as RRE North Site.

A new community hospital for Malvern on the site of Seaford Court, a former private prep school in Malvern Link, close to the station, was opened in 2011. As of 2011, further development was planned for the second decade of the 21st century, with approximately 700 new houses, 10 hectares of employment land, a primary school and community centre destined for former farm land between Malvern Link and Newland. This would effectively merge the two villages into a conurbation with Malvern Link, creating new neighbourhoods that had yet to be named.

==Governance==
Malvern Link constitutes the major part of the Link ward of the civil parish governed by Malvern Town Council (returning 4 councillors to the Town Council) and the same ward is also used to return 3 councillors to Malvern Hills District Council. The ward includes all of Malvern Link from Link Top in the west to the Newland roundabout in the east except a small part of the Malvern Link area in the west that is allocated to Dyson Perrins ward. The area of Malvern Link also includes part of the Pickersleigh ward to the south and also includes the former settlements of Upper Howsell and Lower Howsell.

Malvern Link was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Leigh, in 1894 Malvern Link became a separate civil parish and an urban district, in 1898 the urban district was abolished on 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and became part of Malvern unparished area. In 1951 the parish had a population of 7950.

==Industry and commerce==

Malvern Link is home to the Morgan Motor Company, a manufacturer of luxury sports roadsters, and Chance Brothers, the remaining factory of what was once the largest manufacturer of glassware in the United Kingdom. Malvern&#x27;s fire station is on Worcester Road in Malvern Link.

The main shopping area of Malvern Link stretches along the Worcester Road in from the junction of Spring Lane to the junction of Pickersleigh Road at the Malvern Link railway station. It contains all the retail outlets common to a small town including pharmacies, furniture and dry goods stores, supermarkets, hardware stores, gardening centres, banks, betting shops, groceries, butchers, and cafés and fast-food, and a former cinema that is now a furniture warehouse. A mural on the Pickersleigh Road wall of the Victoria pharmacy depicts many of Malvern&#x27;s landmarks, including the hills, Edward Elgar and Link Stone, which now resides in the churchyard of nearby St Matthias Church. It also contains the opening line (in Latin) of Psalm 121, &#x27;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills&#x27;, the so-called &#x27;Malvern Psalm&#x27;.

A retail park (the Malvern Hills Retail Park) has been in constant development of Malvern Link since the mid-1990s, with stores that include the branches of national chains such as Boots, Morrisons, Marks &amp; Spencer, Matalan, Next and Halfords. The retail park is an extension of the Spring Lane trading estate, a commercial park of small modern factories, warehouses and service providers, that began its development in the early 1960s.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Malvern Link railway station is located in Worcester Road, and provides direct services to Worcester, Hereford, Gloucester, Birmingham, Oxford, London Paddington and Bristol.

===Bus===
Several local bus services connect Malvern Link with the surrounding area including the 42, S42 operated by LMS Travel stopping in Barnards Green bus shelter. Serving areas further afield are: 
the Malvern to Worcester route 44 operated by First Midland Red serving stops at the Barnards Green bus shelter and Pound Bank; The Worcester - Upton-upon-Severn - Malvern route 362/363 operated by Diamond serves that stops at the Barnards Green bus shelter and the Malvern - Gloucester - Cheltenham route 377 (Saturdays only) operated by Diamond, stopping at the Court Road shops and the Barnards Green bus shelter.

===Sport===
The playing fields at Victoria Park provide children&#x27;s &quot;safe&quot; play areas. The main football pitch was replaced in 2021 by a state of the art Basketball Court. One football pitch remains and both Malvern Rugby Club and Barnards Green Cricket Club are a very short distance away.

===Air===
The nearest major airport is Birmingham which is accessible by train via Birmingham New Street and then 10 minutes further on a London Euston train, or trains travelling in the direction.

Birmingham International Airport is assumed to be approximately one hour by road via the M5 and M42 motorways. Gloucestershire Airport located at Staverton, in the Borough of Tewkesbury near Malvern is a busy General Aviation airport used mainly for private charter and scheduled flights to destinations such as the islands of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, pilot training, and by the aircraft of emergency services.

==Education==
One of Malvern&#x27;s two secondary schools, Dyson Perrins CE Sports College, is located in Malvern Link. The school was endowed by and is named after Charles William Dyson Perrins, grandson of the co-founder of Lea and Perrins, the manufacturer of the local product Worcestershire sauce that is sold worldwide. The area also has several primary schools (such as Somers Park Primary School and St. Matthias C of E Primary School). The location of the former independent boys boarding school Seaford Court, is the site of a new Malvern community hospital that was opened in 2010.

==Notable residents==

Edward Elgar, composer. On returning from London to settle in the Malverns, in 1891 Elgar and his wife leased a semi-detached house at 37 Alexandra Road, Malvern Link, which they named &#x27;Forli&#x27;.
They lived in the house until 1898, when the Elgars moved to Storridge. It was during the &#x27;Forli&#x27; years that Elgar composed many of his works, including, among others, &quot;The Black Knight&quot; (1892), &quot;Sursm Corda&quot; (1894), and in 1898 the &quot;Variations on an Original Theme&quot; that gained him his international reputation. The hymnwriter, Eliza F. Morris, also lived in Malvern Link, where she died in 1874.

At regional level, he has held multiple heavyweight championships, including the Commonwealth title twice between 1999 and 2006; the British title twice between 2000 and 2010; and challenged once for the European title in 2003.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Williams turned pro in 1995 knocking out Vance Ideans in two rounds. He fought routinely on Frank Warren undercards and compiled a 15–0 (12 knockouts) record. He is currently managed by London promoter Michael Helliet and is trained by Jim McDonagh. He took his first big step up in April 1999 to challenge Julius Francis for his British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles. A hot favourite, Williams lost in a points decision to the 34-year-old veteran.

Francis would later vacate the Commonwealth title for a big money fight with Mike Tyson. Williams won the title with a closely contested split decision over respected British contender (and former amateur clubmate) Harry Senior.

===First reign as British and Commonwealth champion===
In 2000 Williams put together four knockouts before fighting Mark Potter for the Commonwealth title and the vacant British title. In an extremely dramatic fight, Williams suffered a dislocated right arm, yet very bravely fought on with one arm over two rounds before knocking Potter out with a left uppercut.

After an eight-month layoff for surgery and recovery, Williams returned to knock out a respected opponent – Kali Meehan in 32 seconds, and then avenged his defeat to Francis, stopping him on an eye injury in the 4th round. Afterwards he was signed by Don King and ended 2001 knocking out US journeyman Shaun Robinson in two rounds on an undercard in America.
His tenure under King would prove to be uneventful, and he did not renew his contract at the end of 2002, a year that saw Williams retain his British and Commonwealth titles with a knockout of late sub Michael Sprott and a points win over Keith Long. As this was Williams&#x27; third defence of the British title, he won the Lonsdale belt outright, before dropping out of a fight in America with hard hitting South African southpaw Corrie Sanders, because it coincided with Ramadan.

===European title challenge===
In February 2003 Williams travelled to Germany to fight the Turk Sinan Samil Sam for his European heavyweight title. A hot favourite, Williams was surprisingly dropped three times and stopped in six rounds. In the UK, his local rivals Audley Harrison and Herbie Hide derided him in the press.

Williams returned with a fourth round stoppage of Australian Bob Mirovic to retain his Commonwealth title, then knocked out Michael Sprott in five rounds to defend his British &amp; Commonwealth titles.

To begin 2004, Williams re-signed with Frank Warren then lost his British and Commonwealth in a third meeting with Michael Sprott via a disputed close points decision.

===Williams vs. Tyson===

After two comeback knockout wins, Williams boxed former world champion Mike Tyson in Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville, Kentucky in July 2004. After staggering Williams numerous times in the first round, Tyson was unable to seriously hurt Williams in subsequent rounds and could not cope with Williams&#x27; sustained aggression and accurate combination punching. Williams knocked Tyson down with a series of punches in the fourth round for a knockout win.

===WBC and &quot;The Ring&quot; heavyweight title challenge===
====Williams vs. Klitschko====
In December he finally challenged for a world heavyweight title, but Vitali Klitschko proved too much, as Williams was stopped in the 8th round.

===Second reign as Commonwealth champion===
In December Williams regained his old Commonwealth belt by beating undefeated Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison by split decision. Williams retained the Commonwealth title with a controversial points win over undefeated Matt Skelton in March 2006. After beating Adnan Serin by a third round retirement, Williams lost His Commonwealth title by unanimous decision in a rematch with Skelton

In December 2006 when Skelton dropped out of a fight with Audley Harrison, Williams stepped in at a weeks notice. By his own admission he had been training for eight weeks for a fight with British champion Scott Gammer. Williams lost by T.K.O. in the 3rd 
round, suffering a broken nose.

===Second reign as British champion===
In March 2007 Williams regained the British title in Wales with a 9th-round knockout of Scott Gammer. Williams came in at the lightest he had been since his pro debut 16 stones 4 pounds {4 stones lighter than his previous fight} after training himself for the fight just with a piece of paper that contained a conditioning programme given to him by Joe Dunbar who had worked with Lennox Lewis.

After he had watched the tape of his fight with Gammer, Williams decided he would continue boxing and took a fight with 26–1 22 KOs Ukrainian prospect Oleg Platov. He came in again at 270 lbs. Both fighters were engaged in wild exchanges from the first bell on. The Ukrainian picked up a badly-bleeding cut above the left eye following an accidental headbutt in the second round and he continued to swing wild punches but not without taking some huge shots from Williams. After 2:15 in the fourth and with the cut getting worse, the referee waved the fight off. According to the rules of the IBF, it was declared a no contest. Sauerland managing director Chris Meyer defended the decision. &quot;The rules are clear&quot;, he said. &quot;We had an accidental headbutt and the referee, who consulted the doctor several times, ruled he could not continue to protect his health.&quot; Speaking exclusively to SecondsOut after the fight a disappointed Williams said: &quot;He (Platov) was looking for a way out and he got it. He knew the rules and worked them. He was starting to tire and knew it was only a matter of time before I knocked him out. ...I found it slow in the early rounds but I when I got going I started to get on top. He knew I was gonna knock him out and he was looking for a way out. I’m not sure whether or not it was a punch or a head clash that cut him in the second round. It took be a little while to get going but I really enjoyed it, it was a great fight while it lasted. But he was looking for a way out. He kept falling to the floor and it was only a matter of time before I knocked him out.&quot;

On 30 May 2008 Williams defeated unbeaten German, Konstantin Airich in a highly controversial fight. Williams had a total of 3 points deducted in rounds 2 and 5 creating a feeling afterwards that the referee was blatantly on the side of the German. In addition he was given 2 standing 8 counts by the referee in round 3 despite not actually being knocked down or touching the canvas, and was also counted after slipping in round 4. After managing to fight back and score a knockdown himself in round 5, in the 6th round Williams unleashed a series of extremely punishing blows on his opponent sending him reeling across the ring. At this point Airich&#x27;s promoter Ahmet Oner controversially ran over and rang the timekeeper&#x27;s bell himself to end the round and save his fighter, even though there was still 1:28 left to go in the round. Despite this confusion the fight continued after the shortened 6th round and after seeing his man absorb more heavy punishment in the next round Oner eventually threw in the towel handing Williams a 7th-round TKO victory.

In the aftermath of the fight Williams was extremely critical of the performance of both the referee and fight promoters, and has called for the British Boxing Board of Control to conduct an immediate investigation into the fight.

Williams faced John McDermott at Goresbrook Leisure Centre, Dagenham on 18 July 2008. Despite being deducted three points in rounds eleven and twelve, he defeated McDermott in a majority points decision.

===Williams vs. Sosnowski===
He was due to face John McDermott in a rematch at York Hall on 8 November 2008, but McDermott withdrew due to a rib injury. Williams also faced a bout with Francois Botha on 30 November 2008 in Egypt. Polish fighter Albert Sosnowski was called in as a late replacement for McDermott.

Williams suffered a shock defeat by 8th-round TKO and as a result the Botha fight was called off. The McDermott rematch was finally arranged for 2 May 2009 in a defence of the British Heavyweight Championship belt that Williams held. Williams won the match in a points victory over McDermott.

===Prizefighter===
Williams took part in the Prizefighter tournament on 2 October 2009. In the run up to the tournament Williams said he would knock out Audley Harrison and show himself as the best British heavyweight. In his first bout on the night, Carl Baker from Sheffield beat Williams on points after knocking him down twice in the opening round.

===Williams vs. Chisora===
Williams defended his British title for a third and final time against Derek Chisora on 15 May 2010. Williams lost by KO in round two. Before the fight he promised this would be his last fight, win or lose, but he has yet to announce his retirement. The fight was originally due to take place against Sam Sexton in February but was put back to May after Sexton injured his hand. Sexton withdrew from the fight again after his mother suffered a brain aneurysm and Chisora stepped in as a replacement.

===Comeback===
Williams returned to boxing after nearly a year of inactivity with a 2nd-round TKO victory over German Frank Kary Roth in Bielefeld on 5 March 2011. Williams was now being licensed to fight by the Baltic League of Professional Boxing, with the British Boxing Board of Control stating they had concerns about Williams&#x27;s decline in ability to box. On 9 April, he scored his second KO win since his comeback. He won a 1-round KO against Hungarian Laszlo Toth. On 25 June Williams suffered a TKO defeat against Manuel Charr. The fight was controversially stopped in round 7 after a barrage from Williams was returned by a short flurry from Charr. It appeared that the referee stopped the fight in Charr&#x27;s favour as soon as it looked like he may be in trouble. He then won a SD against Alfred Cole on 3 September, in Sweden, Cole returning after two years away from the sport.

A fight with unbeaten Alexander Ustinov was set to take place in October 2011, but Williams withdrew due to a viral infection. Williams fought the Norwegian heavyweight boxer Leif Olve Dolonen Larsen in Pabellon Municipal, Silla, Valencia, Comunidad Valenciana, Spain on Friday 2 December 2011. Williams was dropped several times by the former NFL footballer and the fight was stopped in the second round. Williams announced his retirement once again shortly afterwards, but a return to boxing was scheduled against 0–3 middleweight Marvin Meyer, leading to various hoax articles claiming that Williams was moving down to middleweight. This fight never happened, and neither did a rematch with Zoltan Petranyi for the Universal Boxing Organisation (UBO) European title, which was called off on the day of the fight after Williams was cut when he fell over in the shower. The two fighters entered the ring on fight night to apologise to the crowd for the incident. A second rescheduling of the fight, which had already been postponed from 2011 due to &quot;personal problems&quot; for Williams, was promised but has yet to be scheduled.

Williams had two unsuccessful title challenges in September 2012, being outpointed in Finland by Janne Katajisto for the obscure Baltic Boxing Union belt and then being stopped in the 4th round against Christian Hammer in a WBO European heavyweight title fight. Williams refused to take a drugs test after the fight, claiming there was no point as he was going to retire, and that he was shot.

Just days after announcing yet another retirement, Williams called out Mark Potter for a rematch of their famous clash in 2000 when Williams knocked out Potter despite having a dislocated shoulder. Potter responded saying he was very keen on the fight. The fight is likely to be unlicensed as Potter&#x27;s BBBofC license was taken away after suffering a detached retina, while the BBBofC have already announced their reservations against licensing Williams. Williams later claimed he had been told to call out Potter on camera, and that he was not being serious.

Once again, Williams&#x27;s retirement proved to be short-lived as he fought Denis Bakhtov in Podolsk, Russia on 8 December 2012, losing by unanimous decision over 10 rounds. He fought again just 13 days later losing in a points decision against Werner Kreiskott over 8 rounds. In March 2013 he was stopped in round 2 by cruiserweight Mairis Briedis in Riga, Latvia. This fight was unsanctioned as it was an exhibition. Danny fought Kelvin Price on 18 May 2013 losing a controversial decision in Russia. He then went on to fight notorious English hard man Dominic Negus in an unlicensed fight in London, England as a farewell to his fans, stopping Negus in the 4th round.

Williams claimed the lightly-regarded Global Boxing Federation (GBF) World Heavyweight title on 28 April 2018 in Hungary when he defeated Czech journeyman Martin Stensky.

In July 2018 in Aberdeen, Williams lost a WBU heavyweight title fight on an event sanctioned by the British &amp; Irish Boxing Authority against former lightweight Lee McAllister. This fight was not recognised by BoxRec. Williams once again announced his retirement after this fight.

==Personal life==
Williams is a devout Muslim and was first drawn to Islam while abroad, &quot;I went to Turkey and heard the Adhan&quot; he explained. &quot;I was a Christian at the time and I got goosebumps and carried on looking into Islam and I just felt this was the way of life for me and this was the way of life for God.&quot;

Williams has 2 daughters, Nubiah (born 1999) and Maliha (born 2004).

<text>Fair Snape Fell is one of the larger hills in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England. It reaches with a prominence of and is classed as a Marilyn. It occupies a position in the very south of the main range of fells, alongside and just to the north of Parlick, to which it is joined by a ridge. The main paths approach the summit from Parlick in the south, Saddle Fell in the east and Bleasdale in the valley to the west. The Saddle Fell approach is as boggy as the hills to the north. The summit is covered in grass and peat groughs. A trig point and large cairn occupy the top of the western escarpment, with the highest point being about to the north-east.

The word &quot;snape&quot; means &quot;pasture&quot;; thus Fair Snape Fell means &quot;fell of the fair (beautiful) pasture&quot;.

Considerable areas of the Bowland fells were used for military training during
World War II and there are still unexploded bombs in some areas, including nearby Wolf Fell.

<doc id="875690" wikidata="Q2311360" url="?curid=875690" title="Spitbank Fort">
<text>Spitbank Fort or Spitsand Fort or Spit Sand Fort or simply Spit Fort is a sea fort built as a result of the 1859 Royal Commission. The fort is one of four built as part of the Palmerston Forts constructions. Located in the Solent, near Portsmouth, England, and is now in private ownership following its sale after a period as a luxury hotel.

==History==
===Active naval installation, 1878-1956===
The four armour-plated forts were designed by Captain E. H. Stewart overseen by Assistant Inspector General of Fortifications, Colonel W. F. D. Jervois. Construction started in 1867, and was completed in 1878, at a cost of £167,300 STG.

Spitbank is smaller than the two main Solent forts, Horse Sand Fort and No Man&#x27;s Land Fort. Its main purpose was as a further line of defence for ships that made it past the two main forts. It is in diameter across at its base, with one floor and a basement and armour plating only on the seaward side. It was originally planned to have been armed with nine 10&quot; 18-ton rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns on the seaward side, and six 7&quot; seven-ton RML guns on the landward side. However, by the time of completion the plan had changed so that the seaward side received nine 12.5-inch muzzle-loading (RML) guns. From 1884 more modern 12-inch breechloading guns were installed and these were in service until after World War I.

In 1898 the role of the fort was changed to defend against light craft and the roof was fitted out with two 4.7&quot; guns and searchlights. In the early 1900s all but three original large guns were removed. Minor upgrades to the smaller guns and searchlights continued through the years. A 2020 report stated that during the Second World War, &quot;the forts were used to defend the Portsmouth dockyards. Life on site was grim; those serving were deliberately chosen for their inability to swim, to avoid any attempt to escape&quot;.

===Disused, 1956-1982===
The fort remained unused after the abolition of coastal artillery in 1956. The fort was declared surplus to requirements in 1962, and put up for sale the following year unsuccessfully. The fort was declared a Scheduled Monument in 1967. The Ministry of Defence sold the fort to a private buyer in 1982, amid other defence spending cuts in the early 1980s.

===Museum, 1982-2009===
Following the purchase of the fort, it underwent restoration and was opened to the public as a museum.

Beginning June 4, 2002 the fort was used as a location for &quot;Banged Up With Beadle&quot;. For six weeks British TV personality Jeremy Beadle was locked in its dungeons. Cameras followed him as he coped with survival, plus learning skills with a different member of the public each week. These skills were put to the test as a live insert each Saturday evening into &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;. It was the venue for the Coalition Festival in the summer of 2009, and other psytrance and hard dance parties.

===Hotel, 2012- present===
In 2009 it was put on sale for but was sold before auction, reportedly for more than £1m. The fort was remodelled, with works reportedly costing around £2.6 million, and opened in 2012 as a luxury spa hotel and retreat with nine bedroom suites.

A 2018 report however, stated that Spitbank, &quot;largely undamaged, has been protected from inappropriate development by its status ... as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and the designers have been scrupulously careful to preserve ... all the fitments...&quot;. At the time, the &quot;9-suite Spitbank ... [was] spectacularly open for business, whether overnight stays, corporate events or weddings&quot;. Events for up to 60 guests could be accommodated, &quot;during the day, but most would have to leave on the last boat&quot;.

In 2020, use of the hotel was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. The hotel was unable to reopen as other English hotels did in July, &quot;due to their unique requirements in both transportation and sanitisation requirements&quot;. All three Clarenco Forts were listed for sale in July. Spitbank Fort was described as a &quot;33,000 sq ft boutique retreat on three floors&quot;. On September 14, 2020, Pendulum recorded a concert at Spitbank Fort to promote their new single &quot;Driver&quot;/&quot;Nothing for Free&quot; that was streamed live on YouTube on October 2, 2020. In June 2024 the fort sold at auction to an unknown buyer for £1,120,000.

<doc id="875693" wikidata="Q4917965" url="?curid=875693" title="Bishop of Ripon">
<text>The Bishop of Ripon is an episcopal title which takes its name after the city of Ripon in North Yorkshire, England. The bishop is one of the area bishops of the Diocese of Leeds in the Province of York. The area bishop of Ripon has oversight of the archdeaconry of Richmond and Craven, which consists of the deaneries of Bowland, Ewecross, Harrogate, Richmond, Ripon, Skipton, and Wensley.

The current title Bishop of Ripon is renamed from Bishop of Knaresborough, which was an episcopal title used by a suffragan bishop of the Church of England Dioceses of Ripon (later Ripon and Leeds) and then of Leeds, in the Province of York, England. The title took its name after the historic market and spa town of Knaresborough in North Yorkshire.

The Diocese of Ripon and Leeds was dissolved on 20 April 2014 and its former territory was added to the new Diocese of Leeds. The first Area Bishop of Ripon was James Bell, who had previously been the suffragan Bishop of Knaresborough and area bishop in Ripon, and was acting diocesan Bishop of Ripon and Leeds until the dissolution of that diocese.

Following the creation of the Diocese of Leeds on 20 April 2014, the see of Knaresborough was eventually renamed to become the suffragan see for the area Bishop of Ripon. To that end the General Synod approved a petition from the Bishop of Leeds in February 2015; that petition was approved by the Queen-in-Council on 19 March 2015 and so the see was translated to Ripon.

James Bell continued in the same See, becoming the area Bishop of Ripon. On 9 November 2017, it was announced that Helen-Ann Hartley, Bishop of Waikato (in Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia) was to become the next Bishop of Ripon and she was installed on 4 February 2018. On 3 February 2023, Hartley was translated to Newcastle. On 27 April 2023, it was announced that Anna Eltringham was to become the next area Bishop of Ripon; she took up the post with her episcopal consecration on 22 June 2023.

<text>ATS Corporation is a Canadian company based in Cambridge, Ontario, that designs and builds factory automation systems. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

== History ==
ATS was founded by Klaus Woerner in 1978. Woerner, who immigrated to Canada from Germany in 1974, ran the company until his death in 2005, overseeing significant growth. In 2007, ATS pulled the planned IPO of its solar division, Photowatt. Partially as a result of this, two hedge funds, Goodwood and Mason Capital Management, led a proxy fight against the firm, leading to the a new board of directors and management team. Anthony Caputo became CEO at this time. Photowatt under-performed significantly in the years that followed; the company eventually sold Photowatt&#x27;s French operations to EDF Group.

In 2011, ATS purchased Sortimat Group, a German life sciences automation firm, for $62 million. In 2013, they purchased German packaging firm IWK for $144 million, and in 2014, they purchased the automation business of German company M+W Group for $362 million.

In February 2017, Andrew Hider was appointed CEO of the company.

In September 2023, ATS acquired Avidity Science, a biomedical research and life sciences water purification equipment provider, for $195 million.

== Operations ==
ATS builds automation systems for the medical devices, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, semiconductor, fiber optics, automotive, computers, solar energy and consumer products industries. As of 2018, they have designed and built 23,000 automation systems.

ATS employs approximately 6500 people worldwide, with 20 facilities in North America, Europe and Asia.

<doc id="875697" wikidata="Q800095" url="?curid=875697" title="Gresham Barrett">
<text>James Gresham Barrett (born February 14, 1961) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he was a candidate for its nomination for Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 election. A resident of Westminster, South Carolina, the district he represented runs along the Savannah River in the northwestern part of the state.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Barrett was born in Westminster in Oconee County. Barrett attended The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and graduated in 1983. He served in the United States Army from 1983 to 1987, attaining the rank of captain in the field artillery. Barrett managed the family&#x27;s furniture store.

==South Carolina legislature==
He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and served from 1996 to 2002, and was assigned to the Education and Public Works Committee, Labor Commerce and Industry Committee, Rules Committee, and the School Choice Ad Hoc Committee. He was also the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Urban Growth. During the 2000 Presidential Election Barrett was a member of the George W. Bush for President South Carolina State Steering Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Barrett won a congressional seat in 2002 to replace Lindsey Graham, who retired to run for the U.S. Senate, and took office in January 2003. He ran unopposed for reelection in 2004. In 2006, Barrett won reelection by defeating Democratic challenger Lee Ballenger with 63 percent of the vote. Barrett outspent his opponent $857,922 to $27,891. In 2008, he defeated Democrat Jane Ballard Dyer, carrying 65 percent of the vote.

===Tenure===
Barrett missed 571 votes as of March 31, 2010, more than any other member of the 111th House and totaling 43% of the votes since the beginning of this term.

According to the National Journal Barrett was among the most conservative members of the U.S. House of Representatives. He was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, National Right to Life Committee, and the National Federation of Independent Business.

In July 2006, Barrett was one of 33 members of the House of Representatives to vote against renewal of the Voting Rights Act. In 2007, he voted against the Democratic version of SCHIP. Barrett supports offshore drilling to make the United States energy independent. On April 15, 2008 Barrett became the 71st Co-Sponsor of the FairTax (H.R. 25 ). Following a 2009 Congressional pay raise that many felt unmerited, Congressman Barrett protested by giving his pay raise to Anderson Interfaith Ministries.

Barrett is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined &quot;unlawful Internet gambling&quot;).

In 2003, Barrett introduced the Stop Terrorist Entry Program Act (STEP). The STEP Act updates and amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to bar the admission of individuals from countries listed by the Department of State as State Sponsors of Terrorism. The STEP Act, as introduced in 2003, would not only bar citizens from the list from ever entering the United States, but would also deport non-immigrant visa holders legally residing in the United States that are citizens of countries on the list. Though Barrett said that the updated STEP Act was in response to the 2009 Fort Hood shooting and the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Airlines Flight 253, Keith Olbermann said neither of the alleged perpetrators would have fallen under its restrictions. Alleged Flight 253 bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is a citizen of Nigeria, which is not listed as a state sponsor of terrorism, and Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan was born in Arlington, Virginia.

** Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia

Candidates for the Republican nomination included; State Attorney General Henry McMaster, State Lt. Governor Andre Bauer, Congressman Barrett, and State Representative Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley led the first nomination ballot with 49% of the vote falling just short of the 50% threshold needed to win the nomination outright on June 8, 2010. Haley won the run-off election on June 22, 2010 with 65% to Barrett&#x27;s 35%.

<doc id="875698" wikidata="Q4918006" url="?curid=875698" title="Bishop of Wakefield">
<text>The [[Bishop]] of [[Wakefield]] is an episcopal title which takes its name after the city of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. The title was first created for a diocesan bishop in 1888, but it was dissolved in 2014. The Bishop of Wakefield is now an area bishop who has oversight of an episcopal area in the Diocese of Leeds.

The area Bishop of Wakefield is one of the area bishops of the Diocese of Leeds in the Province of York. The Bishop of Wakefield has oversight of the archdeaconry of Pontefract, which consists of the deaneries of Barnsley, Pontefract, and Wakefield. As well as being the area bishop for the Wakefield Episcopal Area, Robinson also provides alternative episcopal oversight for the Diocese of Leeds as a whole, administering to those parishes in the diocese which reject the ministry of priests who are women.

The area bishop&#x27;s residence is Pontefract House, Wakefield. The current area Bishop of Wakefield is Tony Robinson, who has previously been the suffragan Bishop of Pontefract until that see was translated (renamed) to Wakefield in 2015.

The Bishop of Pontefract was an episcopal title used by a suffragan bishop of the Church of England Dioceses of Wakefield and then of Leeds, in the Province of York, England. The title took its name after the town of Pontefract in West Yorkshire; the See was erected under the Suffragans Nomination Act 1888 by Order in Council dated 27 October 1930. In the Wakefield diocese, the Bishop of Pontefract was the suffragan bishop for the diocese as a whole but primarily had alternative episcopal oversight for those parishes which rejected the ministry of priests who were women; Robinson now fulfils this role for the new diocese.

Following the creation of the Diocese of Leeds on 20 April 2014, the see was eventually renamed to become the suffragan see for the area Bishop of Wakefield. To that end the General Synod approved a petition from the Bishop of Leeds in February 2015; that petition was approved by the Queen-in-Council on 19 March 2015 and so the see was translated to Wakefield.

<doc id="875700" wikidata="Q4917923" url="?curid=875700" title="Bishop of Monmouth">
<text>The Bishop of Monmouth (Welsh: &quot;Esgob Mynwy)&quot; is the diocesan bishop of the Church in Wales Diocese of Monmouth.

The episcopal see covers the historic county of Monmouthshire with the bishop&#x27;s seat located at Newport Cathedral (commonly known as St Woolos&#x27; Cathedral) in the city of Newport. The former Church of St Woolos, which had existed in Newport since the sixth or seventh century AD, was originally the temporary seat of the Bishop when the Diocese of Monmouth was created in 1921. St Woolos was eventually raised to Cathedral status in 1949.

The bishop&#x27;s residence is Bishopstow, which is in central Newport.

The diocese is one of two new ones founded in the 1920s when the Church in Wales was &#x27;disestablished&#x27; and became independent of the established Church of England. The current Bishop is Cherry Vann, elected in 2019 as the first female Bishop of the Diocese. Her immediate predecessors were Richard Pain, previously Archdeacon of Monmouth, and Dominic Walker OGS, previously area Bishop of Reading in the Church of England. 

The Diocese of Monmouth has also produced a number of Archbishops of Wales, most notably Rowan Williams, who was subsequently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 2002 - believed to be the first Welsh-born bishop to hold that post since the English Reformation in the 16th century. He was also the Archbishop of Wales at the time of his appointment to Canterbury and was styled as &quot;Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Wales and Bishop of Monmouth&quot;.

<text>The [[Bishop]] of [[Swansea]] and [[Brecon]] is the Ordinary of the Church in Wales Diocese of Swansea and Brecon.

The diocese covers the City and County of Swansea and the ancient counties of Brecknockshire and Radnorshire. The diocesan cathedral is the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Evangelist in the town of Brecon, which has been a parish church since the Reformation, becoming elevated to cathedral status in 1923. The diocese is administered from Brecon, with an additional office in Swansea.

The Bishop&#x27;s residence is Ely Tower, Brecon. The office was created in 1923 at the founding of the diocese, an area stretching south to the coast of Gower and north into much of mid-Wales. Immediately prior to the diocese&#x27;s erection, the first bishop, Edward Bevan, had served as Bishop of Swansea, a suffragan in the Diocese of St Davids.

It was announced on 4 November 2021 that John Lomas, Archdeacon of Wrexham had been appointed as the 10th Bishop of Swansea and Brecon. His election was confirmed at a Sacred Synod in Wrexham on 22 November 2021.

<doc id="875709" wikidata="Q4693855" url="?curid=875709" title="Agricore United">
<text>Agricore United, Inc. was a farmer-directed agribusiness in Canada. It supplied crop nutrition and crop protection products, and offered grain handling and marketing services. It was created on November 1, 2001 by the merger of Agricore and United Grain Growers. It was headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Its shares were publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the symbol &quot;AU&quot; (&quot;AU.LV&quot; – Limited voting common shares; &quot;AU.DB&quot; – Convertible 9% debentures; &quot;AU.PR.A&quot; – Series &#x27;A&#x27; preferred shares) until June 15, 2007, when it was taken over by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. Agri-business giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) had a 28% stake in the company at the time of the takeover.

==Corporate history==

===Ancestry===
Agricore United was the continuation of several companies with deep historical roots in western Canada. The Grain Growers&#x27; Grain Company Limited was originally incorporated in 1906 under the laws of Manitoba. In 1917, The Grain Growers&#x27; Grain Company Limited and The Alberta Farmers&#x27; Cooperative Elevator Company Limited amalgamated to form United Grain Growers Limited (UGG). In 1923, the Alberta Wheat Pool (AWP) was incorporated under the laws of Alberta. In 1924, Manitoba Pool Elevators (MPE) was incorporated under the laws of Manitoba. In 1992, UGG was continued under the Governing Act, a Special Act of the Parliament of Canada. In 1998, AWP and MPE merged to form Agricore Cooperative Limited. In 2001, UGG combined its business operations with Agricore Cooperative Ltd. and began doing business as Agricore United.

===Takeover===
In November 2006, the company became the target of takeover bids from two other rival grain handlers: the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (&quot;SaskPool&quot;, &quot;SWP&quot;) of Regina, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg-based James Richardson International (&quot;JRI&quot;). The initial and subsequent offers from SaskPool involved a stock swap, with no or little cash being offered, prompting the AU Board of Directors to reject them. In February 2007, AU and JRI announced that they had negotiated a merger arrangement to form a publicly traded company to be known as &quot;Richardson Agricore&quot;, subject to shareholder agreement.

A subsequent bidding war led to a stock+cash offer from SaskPool and an all-cash offer from JRI to form a private company; a higher, $20.50 all-cash offer from SaskPool in May eventually prevailed, with 81% of the limited voting shares being tendered to the Pool by shareholders by the end of May, including all the ADM shares. This exceeded the 75% required by the terms of AU&#x27;s incorporation to change the corporate structure and, after a special shareholders&#x27; meeting in June, AU became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. AU&#x27;s CEO, Brian Hayward, resigned, as did the Board of Directors, and SaskPool&#x27;s CEO and Board were voted in. SaskPool had Agricore United&#x27;s common and preferred shares delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on June 20, 2007, and the members of the senior management team for the amalgamated company were announced the next day. As of June 29, no decision had been reached on the name or location of the new company, and it was expected to take about 12 months to complete the merging of the company&#x27;s operations.

As a result of the acceptance of the SaskPool offer, JRI received a $35 million termination fee and was able to purchase a number of AU&#x27;s grain and farm supply facilities; Cargill Canada was able to make a similar purchase, as part of a pre-merger deal width SaskPool to satisfy Canada&#x27;s Competition Bureau. AU employees, along with the grain and farm supply inventories at the affected facilities, were transferred to the purchasing companies.

It is generally believed within the Canadian agricultural industry that the biggest winners in the transaction were AU&#x27;s shareholders, with SaskPool paying too much for AU, and that SaskPool gave up too many facilities to their competitors. Substantial number of head office employees are expected to be laid off once the integration of the two companies is complete.

On August 30, 2007, the company formerly known as Agricore United ceased to exist and Saskatchewan Wheat Pool was rebranded to be known as Viterra.

==Operations==

===Grain handling and merchandising===
Agricore bought, marketed and transported grain, oil seeds and other special crops from the farm to end-use markets using the company&#x27;s network of grain elevators from Manitoba to British Columbia and ownership/interest in port terminals in Vancouver, Thunder Bay and Prince Rupert. The grain was moved from the farmer&#x27;s field to the company&#x27;s geographically dispersed and strategically located country elevator network. Grain was then shipped to a domestic, U.S. or Mexican customer, such as a flour mill, crushing plant, feed mill or maltster, or to a port terminal for export to end-use customers in Europe, South America, the Pacific Rim, Africa and the Middle East.

===Crop production services===
The company sold more crop inputs in western Canada than any other company. This included manufacture, distribution and crop production support, including crop nutrition and crop protection products, seed and agronomic services to farmers, through about 200 locations from Manitoba to British Columbia. Agronomic Crop Enhancement (ACE) specialists provide technical advice on crop production issues and help the Customer Service Representative (CSR) advise the grower about choices for the most profitable crop practices. Beyond offering crop nutrition such as fertilizers, more than 200 crop protection products were offered including herbicides and insecticides. Agricore owned or leases three distribution warehouses, and supported the sale of crop nutrition and protection products by providing custom application services directly or through third-party contractors.

===Livestock===
The company&#x27;s livestock business formulated and manufactured feed for dairy and beef cattle, swine, poultry and other specialty feeds from seven HACCP certified feed mills, one HACCP certified pre-mix manufacturing centre and one HACCP compliant pre-mix manufacturing centre. The company had feed mills and pre-mix facilities service customers in B.C., Alberta and Manitoba, including two new feed mills constructed in Olds, AB (2000) and Edmonton, AB (2004).

<text>Charles Emory Patton (July 5, 1859 – December 15, 1937) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Pennsylvania. He was the son of John Patton and the brother of John Patton, Jr.

==Biography==
Patton was born in Curwensville, Pennsylvania and attended the common schools. He graduated from Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania in 1878 and engaged in the lumber business.

He owned and operated the Curwensville Electric Co., and then engaged in the construction contracting business. He was director of the Curwensville National Bank, a member of the school board, serving as president, and a member of the city council, and served as burgess.

He was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-second and Sixty-third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1911 to March 3, 1915. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1914. He was appointed secretary of agriculture for the State of Pennsylvania October 15, 1915, and served in this capacity until January 22, 1920.

He retired to a farm near West Grove, Pennsylvania and resumed his agricultural work.

==Death and interment==
Patton died on his estate, at the age of seventy-eight, and was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Curwensville.

<text>A merchant ship, merchant vessel, trading vessel, or merchantman is a watercraft that transports cargo or carries passengers for hire. This is in contrast to pleasure craft, which are used for personal recreation, and naval ships, which are used for military purposes.

They come in a myriad of sizes and shapes, from inflatable dive boats in Hawaii, to 5,000-passenger casino vessels on the Mississippi River, to tugboats plying New York Harbor, to oil tankers and container ships at major ports, to passenger-carrying submarines in the Caribbean.

Many merchant ships operate under a &quot;flag of convenience&quot; from a country other than the home of the vessel&#x27;s owners, such as Liberia and Panama, which have more favorable maritime laws than other countries.

The Greek merchant marine is the largest in the world. Today, the Greek fleet accounts for some 16 per cent of the world&#x27;s tonnage; this makes it currently the largest single international merchant fleet in the world, albeit not the largest in history.

During wars, merchant ships may be used as auxiliaries to the navies of their respective countries, and are called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel.

==History==
==Definitions==
The term &quot;commercial vessel&quot; is defined by the United States Coast Guard as any vessel (i.e. boat or ship) engaged in commercial trade or that carries passengers for hire.

In English, the term &quot;Merchant Navy&quot; without further clarification is used to refer to the British Merchant Navy; the United States merchant fleet is known as the United States Merchant Marine.

== Name prefixes ==

Merchant ships&#x27; names have a prefix to indicate which kind of vessel they are:

* CS = Cable Ship/Cable layer
* LNG = Gas carrier transporting liquefied natural gas
* LPG = Gas carrier transporting liquefied petroleum gas
* MFV = Motor Fishing Vessel
* MS = Motorship
* MSV = Motor Stand-by Vessel
* MT = Motor Tanker or Motor Tug Boat
* MV = Motor/Merchant Vessel
* MY = Motor Yacht
*NS = Nuclear Ship
* RMS = Royal Mail Ship
* RRS = Royal Research Ship
* RV = Research Vessel
* SS = Steam Ship
* SV = Sailing Vessel (although these can be sub coded as type of sailing vessel)

== Merchant ship categories ==

The UNCTAD review of maritime transport categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and &quot;other ships&quot;, which includes &quot;liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo&quot;. General cargo ships include &quot;multi-purpose and project vessels and Roll-on/roll-off cargo&quot;.

===Cargo ship===
A cargo ship or freighter is any sort of ship or vessel that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world&#x27;s seas and oceans each year; they handle the bulk of international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes.

====Bulk carrier====
A bulk carrier is a ship used to transport bulk cargo items such as iron ore, bauxite, coal, cement, grain and similar cargo. Bulk carriers can be recognized by large box-like hatches on deck, designed to slide outboard or fold fore-and-aft to enable access for loading or discharging cargo. The dimensions of bulk carriers are often determined by the ports and sea routes that they need to serve, and by the maximum width of the Panama Canal. Most lakes are too small to accommodate bulk carriers, but a large fleet of lake freighters has been plying the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway of North America for over a century.

====Container ship====

A container ship is a cargo ship that carries its cargo in standardized containers, in a technique called containerization. These ships are a common means of commercial intermodal freight transport.

====Tanker====
A tanker is a ship designed to transport liquids in bulk. Tankers can range in size from several hundred tons, designed to serve small harbours and coastal settlements, to several hundred thousand tons, with these being designed for long-range haulage. A wide range of products are carried by tankers, including:
* hydrocarbon products such as oil, LPG, and LNG
* chemicals, such as ammonia, chlorine, and styrene monomer
* fresh water
* wine

Different products require different handling and transport, thus special types of tankers have been built, such as chemical tankers, oil tankers, and gas carriers.

Among oil tankers, supertankers were designed for carrying oil around the Horn of Africa from the Middle East; the FSO &quot;Knock Nevis&quot; being the largest vessel in the world, a ULCC supertanker formerly known as &quot;Jahre Viking&quot; (Seawise Giant). It has a deadweight of 565,000 metric tons and length of about . The use of such large ships is in fact very unprofitable, due to the inability to operate them at full cargo capacity; hence, the production of supertankers has currently ceased. Today&#x27;s largest oil tankers in comparison by gross tonnage are &quot;TI Europe&quot;, &quot;TI Asia&quot;, &quot;TI Oceania&quot;, which are the largest sailing vessels today. But even with their deadweight of 441,585 metric tons, sailing as VLCC most of the time, they do not use more than 70% of their total capacity.

Apart from pipeline transport, tankers are the only method for transporting large quantities of oil, although such tankers have caused large environmental disasters when sinking close to coastal regions, causing oil spills. See , &quot;Erika&quot;, &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;, &quot;Prestige&quot; and for examples of tankers that have been involved in oil spills.

==== Coastal trading vessel ====

Coastal trading vessels are smaller ships that carry any category of cargo along coastal, rather than trans-oceanic, routes. Coasters are shallow-hulled ships used for trade between locations on the same island or continent. Their shallow hulls allow them to sail over reefs and other submerged navigation hazards, whereas ships designed for blue-water trade usually have much deeper hulls for better seakeeping.

===Passenger ship===

A passenger ship is a ship whose primary function is to carry passengers. The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers, such as the formerly ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the carriage of freight. The type does however include many classes of ships which are designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight. Indeed, until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail, package freight and express, and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage, and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks, kingposts, or other cargo-handling gear for that purpose. Modern cruiseferries have car decks for lorries as well as the passengers&#x27; cars. Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been removed. A ferry is a boat or ship carrying passengers and sometimes their vehicles. Ferries are also used to transport freight (in lorries and sometimes unpowered freight containers) and even railroad cars (in the case of a train ferry).

<text>MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC), better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with around 90 million customers in over 60 countries. The firm was founded on March 24, 1868. MetLife ranked No. 43 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders. After 85 years as a mutual company, MetLife demutualized into a publicly traded company with an initial public offering in 2000. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia&#x27;s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East. MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.

MetLife&#x27;s head offices and boardroom are located at the MetLife Building at 200 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and New York City which MetLife owned from 1981 to 2005; despite the sale, MetLife increased its leased footprint in the building beginning in 2015.

In January 2016, MetLife announced that it would spin off its U.S. retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial, which launched in March 2017. The continuing MetLife company kept naming rights to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

==History==

===Early years===
The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.

A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen&#x27;s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder&#x27;s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation&#x27;s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).

In 1890, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Building was commissioned to serve as MetLife&#x27;s home office on 23rd Street in Manhattan. The building was completed in stages through 1905. A clock tower was commissioned adjacent to the home office in 1907, and when completed two years later, the building was the world&#x27;s tallest until 1913. The home office complex, which came to include the later art deco Metropolitan Life North Building, remained the company&#x27;s headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the Metropolitan Life Tower (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, &quot;The Light That Never Fails&quot;) featured prominently in MetLife&#x27;s advertising.

In 1905, MetLife lost a legal case, &quot;Pavesich v. New England Life Insurance Company&quot;, where they attempted to use an image of another person for promotion but this was ruled a breach of privacy and libelous: this case became a standardly cited case on privacy in US law.

By 1930, MetLife insured one of five men, women, and children in the United States and Canada. During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate. The company financed the Empire State Building&#x27;s construction in 1929 as well as provided capital for Rockefeller Center&#x27;s construction in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.

===Postwar===

During the post-war era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments. In 1981 MetLife purchased the Pan Am Building from a group that included Pan American World Airways for the price of $400 million. The building was subsequently renamed and the prominently displayed Pan Am logo was replaced with the MetLife logo.

==== De-mutualization and IPO ====
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.

Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process. MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.
====Acquisitions, sales, and major deals====
* 1992 – merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.

By 2000, MetLife&#x27;s reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million, and that year it had become the United States&#x27; number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===Current era===
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States. The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion. That year, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.

MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.

The company&#x27;s sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession. In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company&#x27;s &quot; investment portfolio&quot; as chief investment officer. Henrikson remained the company&#x27;s chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company&#x27;s mandatory retirement age.

In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of World&#x27;s Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.

In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.

===&quot;Too big to fail&quot;===
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve&#x27;s (the Fed&#x27;s) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife&#x27;s ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend. Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital. On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount. Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.

The attempt to escape &quot;too big to fail&quot; regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as &quot;systemically important&quot; to the American economy. If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve. The company appealed this proposal in November 2014. In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed &quot;systemically important,&quot; or &quot;too big to fail&quot;. MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators&#x27; decision, thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision. Three other nonbank companies have been designated as &quot;systemically important&quot;: AIG, General Electric and Prudential. MetLife continued to litigate this issue , with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.

===Fines===
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.

In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn&#x27;t meet federal underwriting requirements.

==Products and services==

, MetLife had a &quot;diverse product mix&quot; which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.

===Disability===
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.

The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance. Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual&#x27;s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident. Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual&#x27;s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident. The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.

== International presence ==
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia&#x27;s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh and Chile.

On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities. The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units. The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife&#x27;s common stock on October 29. Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world&#x27;s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America. The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife&#x27;s 70 million and according to &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.

== MetLife Foundation ==
MetLife Foundation is MetLife&#x27;s independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976 and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015. The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010 and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008. In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion, including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children and financial services aimed at low-income communities. According to the OECD, MetLife Foundation’s financing for 2019 development increased by 20% to US$14 million.

==Relationship with &quot;Peanuts&quot;==
MetLife&#x27;s use of comic strip characters since the mid 1980s, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended &quot;to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant.&quot;

MetLife licensed Snoopy and other &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz&#x27;s heirs (as Charles Schulz himself died in 2000), buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife was reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights. Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.

The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young &amp; Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone &amp; Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.

MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with &quot;Peanuts&quot; on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company&#x27;s sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients. MetLife&#x27;s new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.

MetLife brought Snoopy back in 2023, as mascot for the new MetLife Pet Insurance division.

==Blimp and sports sponsorship==
The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship. The program provided aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and became the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour. “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provided overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby. When MetLife ended their ‘’Peanuts’’ branding, they also brought the blimp program to a close.

 On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL&#x27;s New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium. On January 16, 2017, MetLife agreed to a five-year sponsorship to rename Seibu Dome in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture in Japan as the MetLife Dome.

From 2014 to 2017, MetLife was the title sponsor of the BWF Super Series badminton tournament.

==Weight and longevity data==
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed what were characterized as “desirable weights”. In 1983, the company released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (1954–1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population.

This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The midpoint of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight minus ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.

<doc id="875723" wikidata="Q3695744" url="?curid=875723" title="1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China">
<text>The 1954 Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was adopted and enacted on September 20, 1954, through the first session of the First National People’s Congress in Beijing. This constitution was amended and formulated on the basis of the Common Program of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, which served as a provisional constitution in 1949, and is the first constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the fundamental law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and has the highest legal effect.

== Introduction == 
The first constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was published as 2 documents: the &quot;Common Program of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference&quot; (CPCPPCC), and the &quot;Organic Law of the Central People&#x27;s Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot; The Constitution of 1954 was the first codified constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic, and according to its preamble is &quot;based on the CPCPPCC of 1949, and is an advance on it.&quot; The constitution of 1954 includes the Preamble, four chapters, 106 articles, and it defines &quot;the national flag of People&#x27;s Republic of China is a red flag with 5 stars&quot; (Article 104); &quot;the national emblem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is: in the center, Tien An Men under the light of five stars, and encircled by ears of grain and a cogwheel.&quot; (Article 105); and &quot;the capital of People&#x27;s Republic of China is Peking [Beijing].&quot; (Article 106). During the development of socialism, the Constitution of 1954 stipulated the task for the ongoing Chinese communist state. Like the Common Program, the new Constitution limited any reference of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the preamble. Unlike the Common Program, however, which mentioned the CCP as merely one party within the United Front, the 1954 constitution declared that the CCP was the leader of the front and credited it with ending a &quot;century of heroic struggle&quot; against &quot;imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism.&quot; Under this situation, China finally became a one-party state under the uncontested control of the CCP. 
On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi, then the Chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, fell victim to the Red Guards. Although constitutionally Liu could only be removed by the National People&#x27;s Congress, since the force of the dawning Cultural Revolution was too great, the Communist Party hierarchy intervened and expelled Liu from office.

The 1954 Constitution was replaced in the midst of the Cultural Revolution by the 1975 Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Books published in the PRC since the 1980s regarded it and the 1978 Constitution with &quot;serious errors&quot;. In the 1954 Constitution, the Chairman (now translated as president) could convene Supreme State Conferences—emergency meetings. This Presidential right was never seen again in later promulgations of the Chinese constitution.

== Summary of the constitution of 1954 ==
The first chapter in the Constitution of 1954 includes 20 articles and it deals with the general issue of defining social and economic structure. The first chapter, gave the primary definition of “the nature of regime, the structure of ownership, people’s property rights and so on.” Heavily considering the state of the country at the time, the first part of the constitution emphasized the equality between the Han nationality and the other fifty-five minority nationalities.

The second chapter consists of 64 articles; this part stipulates the relationship between “the national people’s congress (NPC), Chairman of China, State Council, and the local people’s congress, the local people’s councils” with “the Organs of self-government of National Autonomous Areas, the people’s courts and the people’s Procuratorates”.

The third chapter indicates rights and duties of the country’s citizen. It guarantees the equality of each citizen and it prohibits racial discrimination and oppression. This chapter consists of 19 articles and it protects a citizen’s customs, habits and religious beliefs.

The last chapter, which is the fourth chapter, stipulates the national flag, the national emblem and the capital of PRC.

<text>Aptalis was a company in the pharmaceutical industry. In January 2014, the company was acquired by Forest Laboratories (acquired by Allergan) for $675 million. Through a series of acquisitions, the company is now a contract development and manufacturing organization and rebranded as Adare Phama Solutions, headquartered in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.

==History==
===Merger of predecessor companies: Axcan and Eurand===
Axcan specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Formerly traded publicly on NASDAQ, Axcan was acquired by TPG Capital in 2008. Eurand Pharmaceuticals was a producer and contract manufacturer of sustained release dosage forms or taste-masked pharmaceutical dosage forms. Both Axcan and Eurand produced and marketed versions of the drug pancrelipase, which is used in the treatment of symptoms related to cystic fibrosis.

In 2011, Eurand Pharmaceuticals and Axcan Pharma merged to form Aptalis.

===Product launches===
In June 2011, the company received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell a low strength version of ZENPEP (pancrelipase) capsules formulated for infants with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis.

On January 9, 2012, the company announced an agreement to market RECTIV, an ointment for the treatment of anal fissure, in the United States.

On January 18, 2012, the company announced that its partner, Gilead Sciences, received approval for the oral powder formulation of Viread (tenofovir disoproxil).

On September 3, 2013, the company launched PYLERA capsules (Bismuth subcitrate/metronidazole/tetracycline), which, in combination with omeprazole, is indicated for the treatment of patients with helicobacter pylori infections.

===Acquisition of the company by Forest Laboratories===
In January 2014, Forest Laboratories (now part of Allergan) announced that it had agreed to acquire Aptalis for $2.9 billion in cash.

Aptalis withdrew its planned initial public offering after the announcement.

In April 2015, TPG Capital acquired Aptalis Pharmaceutical Technologies and the company was renamed Adare Pharmaceuticals.

In September, 2020, Thomas Lee Partners and Frazier Healthcare acquired Adare Pharmaceuticals and turned into a contract development and manufacturing organization.

<text>A stationary bicycle (also known as exercise bicycle, exercise bike, spinning bike, spin bike, or exercycle) is a device used as exercise equipment for indoor cycling. It includes a saddle, pedals, and some form of handlebars arranged as on a (stationary) bicycle.

A stationary bicycle is usually a special-purpose exercise machine resembling a bicycle without wheels. It is also possible to adapt an ordinary bicycle for stationary exercise by placing it on bicycle rollers or a trainer. Rollers and trainers are often used by racing cyclists to warm up before racing, or to train on their own machines indoors.

==History==
The ancestors of modern stationary bicycles date back to the end of the eighteenth century. The Gymnasticon was an early example.

==Types==
Some stationary bike models feature handlebars that are connected to the pedals so that the upper body can be exercised along with the lower body (much like an elliptical trainer). Most exercise bikes come with mechanisms to apply resistance to the pedals, enhancing the intensity of the exercise. Resistance mechanisms include magnets, fans, and friction mechanisms. Some models allow the user to pedal backwards to exercise antagonist muscles which are not exercised in forward pedaling. Exercise bicycles are typically manufactured using a crankshaft and bottom bracket, which turns a flywheel by means of a belt or chain. The bearings on these moving parts wear with use and may require replacement.

Specialized indoor bicycles manufactured using a weighted flywheel at the front are used in the indoor cycling exercises called spinning.
A variety of indoor mini-cycles, sometimes referred to as exercise pedallers, have emerged as portable, low-cost substitutes for traditional stationary bicycles. They are useful when exercisers are unable to access their stationary bicycles from their homes or local gyms when travels or at work. 

==Uses==
Exercise bikes are used for exercise, to increase general fitness, for weight loss, and for training for cycle events. The exercise bike has long been used for physical therapy because of the low-impact, safe, and effective cardiovascular exercise it provides. The low-impact movement involved in operating an exercise bike does not put much stress on joints and does not involve sporadic motions that some other fitness equipment may require. However, as with typical biking, extended use of a stationary bike has been linked to decreased sexual function.

Stationary bikes are also used for physical testing, i.e. as ergometers for measuring power. Traditionally this is done by imposing a certain level of resistance mechanically and/or measuring this. gives a good overview. Modern ergometers and even many consumer exercise bikes are fitted with electronic sensors and displays.

Ergometers, such as CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System), are used in space (e.g. in the ISS) to counter cardiovascular deconditioning in the microgravity environment.

Exercise bikes are frequently used in cardiac rehabilitation programs to help individuals recover from heart-related conditions or surgeries. The controlled and adjustable nature of stationary biking makes it an ideal choice for gradually improving cardiovascular health after cardiac events.

Mini-cycles provide low-intensity exercise that helps users &quot;burn calories, combat cholesterol, help moderate blood sugar levels, provide gentle toning, keep joints mobile through gentle use, and improve general circulation.&quot; They are also often used by people for rehabilitation purposes after suffering physical injuries.

<doc id="875733" wikidata="Q3695745" url="?curid=875733" title="1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China">
<text>The 1975 Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was promulgated by the 4th National People&#x27;s Congress. The offices of Chairman and Vice-Chairman were officially scrapped under the Constitution after almost 7 years of functional non-existence since the purge of Liu Shaoqi.

This Constitution reduced the total number of articles to just thirty, compared to 106 of articles in the 1954 Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

While the 1954 constitution had previously restricted any mention of Chinese Communist Party to preamble, leaving a document with a nominally liberal democratic text, the 1975 Constitution witnessed an integration (in part) of party and state. The Constitution states that the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the armed services of the PRC, is to be controlled by the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and that the Premier of the State Council is to be elected by the National People&#x27;s Congress on the motion of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Such linkage between party and state would no longer be seen in later Constitutions, particularly after 1982. The most significant link, however, came in Article 2, which stated that the Chinese Communist Party was the leading force of the Chinese people.

The 1975 Constitution remained in effect for about three years due to the death of Mao Zedong and the rise of Hua Guofeng the following year, the latter of whom ordered its replacement with a new document to solidify his position as Mao&#x27;s successor. It was thus the shortest-lived constitution in the history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

From 1949 to 1981, he made several film appearances, with significant roles in &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949), &quot;Operation Pacific&quot; (1951), &quot;Gangbusters&quot; (1954), and supporting roles in &quot;The Beatniks&quot; (1960) and &quot;Suppose They Gave A War and Nobody Came&quot; (1969).

He voiced the title character of Rod Rocket in an early 1960s educational series, and did some episodes of the cult classic &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;. His last work for Disney was as Ollie Owl opposite singer Burl Ives as Sam the Eagle on their long-running America Sings attraction at Disneyland. There were numerous TV and radio commercials as well, both in front of and behind the camera.

<doc id="875757" wikidata="Q4578116" url="?curid=875757" title="1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China">
<text>The 1978 Constitution of the [[People&#x27;s Republic of China]] was promulgated in 1978. This was the PRC&#x27;s 3rd constitution, and was adopted at the 1st Meeting of the 5th National People&#x27;s Congress on March 5, 1978, two years after the downfall of the Gang of Four.

The number of articles grew from the 1975 Constitution&#x27;s 30 articles to double the amount. The courts and the procurates, which were minimized or dumped altogether in the 1975 Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, were somewhat restored. A greater degree of separation of party and state was also instituted, with the party leadership&#x27;s right to nominate cabinet ministers deleted and returned to the Premier. A number of checks and balances present in the 1954 Constitution, including term limits for party leaders, elections and more independence in the judiciary, were restored.

The 1978 Constitution was the first Constitution in the PRC to touch explicitly on the political status of Taiwan. It said that &quot;Taiwan is part of China&quot; and said that the PRC &quot;must liberate Taiwan, and finish the great task of reunifying the motherland&quot;. However, in 1979, the PRC dropped the liberation stance and opted for peaceful reunification instead. The 1982 Constitution mentioned that &quot;Taiwan is a sacred part of the territory of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; instead of just &quot;China&quot;.

Citizen rights were also reinstated somewhat. The right to strike was still present, although it would be removed in the 1982 Constitution. However, the required support for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system remained as part of citizens&#x27; duties.

Altogether, the Constitution still suffered from the backdrop of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary language was still persistent (such as &quot;Revolutionary Committees&quot;), although the slogans were gone. The 1978 Constitution survived for four years before being superseded by the current (1982) Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the Deng Xiaoping era.

Although short-lived, the 1978 Constitution witnessed the first time since the 1950s that the document was considered authoritative enough for its provisions to remain within the Communist Party&#x27;s attention. For instance, after the Democracy Wall movement saw students using the constitutionally-guaranteed right to use big character posters to criticize the government, the party responded by ordering a series of constitutional amendments which deleted this right in 1980. Previously, during the Tienanmen Square Incident in 1976 when this same right had been invoked to criticize the Cultural Revolution, protests were forcibly suppressed without the relevant constitutional provisions being acknowledged in any way by the authorities.

In addition to inheriting some fundamental principles from the 1954 Constitution, the 1978 Constitution officially included the Four Modernizations policy with an emphasis on socialist democracy, scientific and educational development. It also mandated in the preamble part that China must &quot;be constructed into a great, powerful, modern socialist country in agriculture, industry, national defense, science and technology within the century&quot;.

<text>Michael Charles Chiklis (; born August 30, 1963) is an American actor. He is best known for his role as Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Detective Vic Mackey on the FX police drama &quot;The Shield&quot; (2002–2008), for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2002, and was nominated in 2003. 

Other starring television roles of his include Commissioner Tony Scali on the ABC police drama &quot;The Commish&quot; (1991–1996), Chris Woods in &quot;Daddio&quot; (2000), Jim Powell on the ABC science-fiction comedy-drama &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot; (2010–2011), Vincent Savino in the CBS crime drama &quot;Vegas&quot; (2012), Dell Toledo in &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot; (2014), and Nathaniel Barnes in &quot;Gotham&quot; (2015–2017). In film, he is best known for his roles as The Thing in two &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; films (2005–2007), George Callister in &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; (2008), Terry Eidson in &quot;When the Game Stands Tall&quot; (2014), and Father Dave in &quot;Hubie Halloween&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Chiklis was born on August 30, 1963, in Lowell, Massachusetts. His mother, Katherine (née Vousboukis), is a hospital administrative aide, and his father, Charlie Chiklis, runs a hair and beauty salon. Chiklis has been described as having inherited his acting ability from his mother. His father is a second-generation Greek American (his paternal ancestors came from Lesbos), and his mother is of Greek and Irish descent. Chiklis grew up in Andover, Massachusetts and began entertaining his family with celebrity imitations when he was 5 years old. As a child, Chiklis appeared in regional theater productions and became a member of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association at age 13. In the ninth grade, he portrayed Hawkeye Pierce in Andover High School&#x27;s production of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. He graduated from Boston University College of Fine Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.

==Career==
After graduating from college, Chiklis moved to Brooklyn, New York, and was cast in the role of John Belushi in the controversial biopic &quot;Wired&quot; (1989). The film was panned in general and flopped at the box office, though Chiklis&#x27;s performance as Belushi (one of his idols) was highly praised. He also guest starred in several popular television series such as &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot;, &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, as well as in bit parts in such films as &quot;Nixon&quot;.

Chiklis&#x27; first successful role was in &quot;The Commish&quot;, a police comedy/drama that ran from 1991 to 1996 on ABC. Chiklis played Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; J. Scali, a police commissioner in a small city in upstate New York. After &quot;The Commish&quot;, Chiklis starred in the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Daddio&quot;.

In 1997, Chiklis replaced Rob Becker in the Broadway one-man show &quot;Defending the Caveman&quot;, taking on the role from January 1997 to the show&#x27;s closing in June 1997.

After playing Curly Howard in the TV film &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; (2000), Chiklis decided to reinvent his image. With his wife&#x27;s help, he spent six months on an extensive workout regimen and shaved his head. He turned up to audition for &quot;The Shield&quot; looking nothing like the pudgy, friendly character of &quot;The Commish&quot;. Chiklis won over creator Shawn Ryan and nabbed the leading role of the show&#x27;s anti-hero, LAPD Detective Vic Mackey. He won the 2002 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for the role. Chiklis received a Golden Globe Award that same year for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series-Drama as well. Between 2004 and 2005, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Series but did not win. Chiklis later parodied his role as Vic Mackey in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode, &quot;Monstourage&quot;; the skit involved Mackey accidentally switching places with Ben Grimm.

Since 2000, Chiklis has taken up a number of voice roles, voicing Chihiro&#x27;s father, Akio, in the English dub of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and Roman/King Webster in the direct-to-video feature &quot;The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina&quot;. He has also performed in several episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot; and had a voice role in &quot;Heavy Gear: The Animated Series&quot;.

In 2005, he starred in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2005) as Thing and reprised the role in its sequel, &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot; (2007). A fan of the comic book series, he had dreamed of playing the character if ever a Fantastic Four film were produced. Chiklis was often praised for his performance in a film that otherwise earned mixed reviews.
In the film &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; (2008), Chiklis portrays the United States Secretary of Defense.

In the wake of the Bernie Madoff scandal, Chiklis was developing a series at FX about a similar investment scheme. The project, called &quot;House of Cards&quot;, concerns a group committing an elaborate scam similar to the Madoff fraud. Chiklis had been developing the project since February 2008 after he and his wife became victims of a Ponzi scheme themselves. Chiklis planned to executive produce but not star.

Chiklis later starred in the ABC television series &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot;, which premiered on September 28, 2010, as part of the 2010–11 television season and ended in April 2011. He also co-starred in the CBS crime drama &quot;Vegas&quot;.

In March 2014, it was announced that Chiklis had been cast in &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;, season 4 of the FX anthology series.

In 2014, Chiklis played a small part towards the end of the FX series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;. He appears first in the episode &quot;Rose Red&quot;, as a trucker who first encounters Gemma, who is on her way to her father, at a truck stop. He also plays a truck driver in the series finale.

In 2015, he appeared in &quot;Gotham&quot; as Captain Nathaniel Barnes. In a nod to Chiklis&#x27; time on the Strike Team on &quot;The Shield&quot;, his character established a similarly named &quot;Strike Force&quot;.

In September 2016, Chiklis released his first solo album, &quot;INFLUENCE&quot;. He wrote and produced the album at his own Extravaganza Music Studio.

Chiklis is also referenced by sketch comedians Jake and Amir, with Amir&#x27;s character reportedly going &quot;dickless for Michael Chiklis&quot; after seeing every Chiklis movie.

==Personal life==

Chiklis married Michelle Moran on June 21, 1992, and they have two daughters: Autumn, born on October 9, 1993, and Odessa, born on March 26, 1999. Autumn played Vic Mackey&#x27;s daughter Cassidy on &quot;The Shield&quot;.

A lifelong comic book fan he especially enjoyed Fantastic Four prior to his role as Ben Grimm, it was reported in 2010 that Chiklis rarely turns down an autograph request from children.

Chiklis is a fan of both the Boston Red Sox, and the Boston Bruins, was interviewed for the HBO documentary &quot;The Curse of the Bambino&quot; about the Red Sox&#x27;s long struggle to win the World Series, and narrated the video introduction of the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX.

Chiklis is also an accomplished musician, specializing in drums and vocals, but also playing guitar and bass. He is a member of several performing bands in the Boston area such as The Surgeon General, Best Kept Secret, and Double Talk. He has starred in and produced films through his own production company, Extravaganza.

In 2011, Chiklis and his band MCB released their first single &quot;Til I Come Home&quot;, a tribute song to the soldiers overseas. The song was used in his TV series &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot; in 2011. MCB&#x27;s prior music includes another single, &quot;Make Me High&quot;, written for the independent film &quot;High School&quot; (2010), starring Chiklis, Adrien Brody, Colin Hanks, and Matt Bush; the single was released in spring 2011.

Following his stint on &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;, Chiklis told Larry King that he did not enjoy working on the show: &quot;That was one of the darkest years of my career. It was, I think, it&#x27;s one thing to do a horror film in the context of like two months or something like that, but to live in that for six months it just became, I don&#x27;t know. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m an empathetic person, and I just sometimes start to take things on. But it was so dark, and it was so nasty.&quot;

===Philanthropy===
Chiklis has participated in celebrity Texas hold &#x27;em tournaments to benefit comedian Brad Garrett&#x27;s charity foundation, Maximum Hope. Chiklis has worked closely with many different charities over the years including The Children&#x27;s Lifesaving Foundation, Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, Autism Speaks and the Revlon Run Walk.

<text>The Calgary Boomers were a Canadian soccer team that competed in the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1980–81 Indoor and 1981 outdoor seasons. The team was based in Calgary and played their home games at Stampede Corral during the indoor season and McMahon Stadium for outdoor matches. Originally founded as the Memphis Rogues, the team relocated to Calgary when it was purchased by Nelson Skalbania after the 1980 season. After loses of over $2 million during its operations, the team was placed into receivership and its assets sold.

==History==
Founded as the Memphis Rogues in 1978, the team was purchased for $1.2 million by Nelson Skalbania, during the 1980 North American Soccer League season with the intention of moving the team to Calgary, as Skalbania did the Atlanta Flames which he purchased five months previously. The team debuted in the 1980–81 NASL Indoor season finishing its initial campaign with a record of 10 win and 8 losses with an average attendance of 4,672 and only missing out of a playoff berth base on goals scored. The Boomers finished the 1981 outdoor in second place in Northwest Division with 17 wins and 15 losses and a season average attendance of 10,501. The number 8 seed in the playoffs, the Boomers lost to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in best of three games first round 3–1 on August 23 and 2–0 on August 26.

At a press conference on September 16, 1981, owner Nelson Skalbania announced that unless the team could sell 6,500 indoor season tickets and a local ownership group found to purchase the team, the organization would cease operations the following Monday. The next day, the league announced the Boomers were one of five teams that failed to post the required $150,000 bond to participate in the 1981–82 NASL Indoor season. The following week, it was reported that GM Rudi Schiffer had delivered the $150,000 performance bond nine days after the deadline while attending the NASL meetings in Toronto and that a group of local businessmen had conditionally purchased the team in an effort to keep it Calgary. A few days later on September 28, 1981, it was announced that the Boomers would merge with the Edmonton Drillers with Skalbania selling his interest in the team to Edmonton Oilers owner Peter Pocklington. The following day, however, the team which recorded loses over $2 million, was placed into receivership, the deal fell through and the Boomer players were released to other team via a dispersal draft. Skalbania was later order by the Supreme Court of British Columbia to pay Memphis Rogues owner Avron Fogelman the $1.1 million balance of the team&#x27;s original purchase price, having only paid the initial $125,000 down payment.

<doc id="875785" wikidata="Q1156505" url="?curid=875785" title="Social effects of evolutionary theory">
<text>The social effects of evolutionary thought have been considerable. As the scientific explanation of life&#x27;s diversity has developed, it has often displaced alternative, sometimes very widely held, explanations. Because the theory of evolution includes an explanation of humanity&#x27;s origins, it has had a profound impact on human societies. Some have vigorously denied acceptance of the scientific explanation due to its perceived religious implications (e.g. its implied rejection of the special creation of humans presumably described in the Bible). This has led to a vigorous conflict between creation and evolution in public education, primarily in the United States.

==Evolution and ethics==
The theory of evolution by natural selection has also been adopted as a foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as social Darwinism, an idea that preceded the publication of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, popular in the 19th century, which holds that &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot; (a phrase coined in 1851 by Herbert Spencer, 8 years before Darwin published his theory of evolution) explains and justifies differences in wealth and success among societies and people. A similar interpretation was one created by Darwin&#x27;s cousin, Francis Galton, known as eugenics, which claimed that human civilization was subverting natural selection by allowing the less bright and less healthy to survive and out-breed the smarter and more healthy.

Later advocates of this theory suggested radical and often coercive social measures in an attempt to &quot;correct&quot; this imbalance. Thomas Huxley spent much time demonstrating through a series of thought experiments that it would not only be immoral, but impossible. Stephen Jay Gould and others have argued that social Darwinism is based on misconceptions of evolutionary theory, and many ethicists regard it as a case of the is-ought problem. After the atrocities of the Holocaust became linked with eugenics, it greatly fell out of favor with public and scientific opinion, though it was never universally accepted by either, and at no point in Nazi literature is Charles Darwin or the scientific theory of evolution mentioned.

In his book &quot;The End of Faith&quot;, Sam Harris argues that Nazism was largely a continuation of Christian anti-Semitism. Jim Walker compiled a list of 129 quotes from Mein Kampf in which Hitler described himself as a Christian, or mentioned God, Jesus or a biblical passage. Some argue that six million of the people killed during the Holocaust were killed because of their religion (Judaism) not their race, &quot;strength,&quot; or any reason with an obvious link to the mechanism of Darwinian evolution. Hitler often used Christian beliefs like, &quot;Jews killed Jesus,&quot; to justify his anti-Semitism.

The notion that humans share ancestors with other animals has also affected how some people view the relationship between humans and other species. Many proponents of animal rights hold that if animals and humans are of the same nature, then rights cannot be distinct to humans.

Charles Darwin, in fact, considered &quot;sympathy&quot; to be one of the most important moral virtues — and that it was, indeed, a product of natural selection and a trait beneficial to social animals (including humans). Darwin further argued that the most &quot;sympathetic&quot; societies would consequently be the most &quot;successful.&quot; He also stated that our sympathy should be extended to &quot;all sentient beings&quot;:

==Evolution and religion==
Before Darwin&#x27;s argument and presentation of the evidence for evolution, Western religions generally discounted or condemned any claims that diversity of life is the result of an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the Unitarian church and the liberal Anglican theologians who went on to publish &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, as well as by many scientists in France and Scotland and some in England, notably Robert Edmund Grant. Literal or authoritative interpretations of Scripture hold that a supreme being directly created humans and other animals as separate &quot;Created kinds&quot;, which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as creationism. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to the teaching of evolution theory, particularly by conservative evangelicals. They have expressed concerns about the effects of the teaching of evolution on society and their faith (see Creation–evolution controversy).

In response to the wide scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution, many religions have formally or informally synthesized the scientific and religious viewpoints. Several important 20th century scientists (Fisher, Dobzhansky) whose work confirmed Darwin&#x27;s theory, were also Christians who saw no incompatibility between their experimental and theoretical confirmations of evolution and their faith. Some religions have adopted a theistic evolution viewpoint, where God provides a divine spark that ignited the process of evolution and (or) where God has guided evolution in one way or another.

===Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church, beginning in 1950 with Pope Pius XII&#x27;s encyclical Humani Generis, took up a neutral position with regard to evolution. &quot;The Church does not forbid that...research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter.&quot;

In an October 22, 1996, address to the Pontifical Academy of Science, Pope John Paul II updated the Church&#x27;s position, recognizing that Evolution is &quot;more than a hypothesis&quot; - &quot;In his encyclical Humani Generis, my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines.&quot;

===Islamic views on evolution===
===Jewish views on evolution===
==Evolutionary theory and the political left==

In 1861 Karl Marx wrote to his friend Ferdinand Lassalle, &quot;Darwin’s work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle. ... Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, for the first time, &#x27;teleology&#x27; in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained.&quot;

Most later Marxists agreed with this view, but some – particularly those in the early Soviet Union – believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals. As a result, they came to support Lamarckism instead – the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This led to the practice of Lysenkoism, which caused agricultural problems.

In his book, &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot;, anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin argued that co-operation and mutual aid are as important in the evolution of the species as competition and mutual strife, if not more so.

On the contemporary moderate left, some authors such as Peter Singer (in his book, &quot;A Darwinian Left&quot;) support Darwinism but reach different political and economic lessons than more conservative observers. Richard Dawkins&#x27; book, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, has a chapter, &quot;Nice guys finish first,&quot; that attempts to explain the role of altruism and cooperation in evolution and how social animals not only cannot survive without such traits, but how evolution will create them. Dawkins explains that when an animal sacrifices itself or uses its resources for the survival of other members of the same species, its genes, present in the other animals, survive. For example, if a mother dies to save three of its pups, one and a half copies (on average) of its genes will survive, because there is a 50% chance of a particular gene being present in its offspring. Dawkins also made a documentary of the same name. According to the documentary, Dawkins added that chapter as a way of overcoming modern day misinterpretations of the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.
Left-wing transhumanists see technology as a means to overcome inequalities that stem from biology. New left feminist Shulamith Firestone saw technological control over reproduction as essential for gender equality. More recently the Laboria Cuboniks collective has articulated an antinaturalist politics that seeks to overcome essentialist categories through technological empowerment.

==Evolution in relation to Social Darwinism and Imperialism==

&quot;Social Darwinism&quot; is a derogatory term associated with the 19th century Malthusian theory developed by Whig philosopher Herbert Spencer. It is associated with evolutionary theory but now widely regarded as unwarranted. Social Darwinism was later expanded by others into ideas about &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in commerce and human societies as a whole, and led to claims that social inequality, sexism, racism and imperialism were justified. However, these ideas contradict Darwin&#x27;s own views, and contemporary scientists and philosophers consider these ideas to be neither mandated by evolutionary theory nor supported by data.

Social Darwinism is further linked with nationalism and imperialism. During the age of New Imperialism, the concepts of evolution justified the exploitation of &quot;lesser breeds without the law&quot; by &quot;superior races.&quot; To elitists, strong nations were composed of white people who were successful at expanding their empires, and as such, these strong nations would survive in the struggle for dominance. With this attitude, Europeans, except for Christian missionaries, seldom adopted the customs and languages of local people under their empires. Christian missionaries, on the other hand, were the very first individuals to meet new peoples and develop writing systems for local inhabitants&#x27; languages that lacked one. Being critics of Social Darwinism, they ardently opposed slavery and provided an education and religious instruction to the new peoples they interacted with since they felt that this was their duty as Christians.

<text>Arthur Terence Galt MacDermot (December 18, 1928 – December 17, 2018) was a Canadian-American composer, pianist and writer of musical theater. He won a Grammy Award for the song &quot;African Waltz&quot; in 1960. His most-successful musicals were &quot;Hair&quot; (1967; its cast album also won a Grammy) and &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1971). MacDermot also composed music for film soundtracks, jazz and funk albums, and classical music, and his music has been sampled in hit hip-hop songs and albums. He is best known for his work on &quot;Hair&quot;, which produced three number-one singles in 1969: &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;, and the title song &quot;Hair&quot;.

==Biography==
MacDermot was born in Montreal, the son of Canadian diplomat Terence MacDermot and Elizabeth Savage. He was educated at Upper Canada College and Bishop&#x27;s University (Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from Cape Town University, South Africa, and made a study of African music his specialty. He studied the piano privately with Neil Chotem. 

It was also during his time at Cape Town where he would meet his future wife, Marlene Bruynzeel, a clarinetist of Dutch descent. They married in 1956 and had five children.

MacDermot won his first Grammy Award for the Cannonball Adderley recording of his song &quot;African Waltz&quot; (from the album of the same name) in 1960. 

MacDermot moved to New York City in 1964 where, three years later, he wrote the music for the hit musical &quot;Hair&quot;, which he later adapted for the 1979 film of the same name. Its Broadway cast album won a Grammy Award in 1969, and the musical generated three number-one singles that year: &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;, and the title song &quot;Hair&quot;. His next musicals were &quot;Isabel&#x27;s a Jezebel&quot; (1970) and &quot;Who the Murderer Was&quot; (1970), which featured British progressive rock band Curved Air.

MacDermot had another hit with the musical &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1971), which won the Tony Award for Best Musical. For that show, MacDermot was nominated for a Tony for best music and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music. His later musicals, including &quot;Dude&quot; and &quot;Via Galactica&quot; (both 1972) and &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (1984), were not successful on Broadway, running 16 performances, 7 performances, and 13 performances respectively.

MacDermot&#x27;s film soundtracks include &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot;, a 1970 blaxploitation film starring Godfrey Cambridge, Raymond St. Jacques, and Redd Foxx, based on Chester Himes&#x27;s novel of the same name; &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; (1974) starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, and directed by original Broadway &quot;Hair&quot; director Tom O&#x27;Horgan; and &quot;Mistress&quot; (1992). He wrote his own orchestrations and arrangements for his theater and film scores.

In 1979, MacDermot formed the &quot;New Pulse Jazz Band&quot;, which performed and recorded his original music and was one of the first jazz bands to feature synthesizer. The band played as part of the on-stage band in the 2009 Broadway revival of &quot;Hair&quot;. MacDermot&#x27;s oeuvre also includes ballet scores, chamber music, the Anglican liturgy, orchestral music, poetry, incidental music for plays, band repertory, and opera.

In 2009, MacDermot was inducted into the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

On November 22, 2010, MacDermot was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by SOCAN at the 2010 SOCAN Awards in Toronto.

==Death==
MacDermot died at his home in Staten Island, New York on December 17, 2018.

==Samples and other use==
MacDermot&#x27;s music is popular with collectors of jazz and funk. Working with jazz musicians such as Bernard Purdie, Jimmy Lewis, and Idris Muhammad, MacDermot created pieces that prefigured the funk material of James Brown. In more-recent decades, his work became popular with hip hop musicians including Busta Rhymes, who sampled &quot;Space&quot; from MacDermot&#x27;s 1969 record &quot;Woman Is Sweeter&quot; for the smash-hit &quot;Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check&quot;, and Run DMC, which sampled the &quot;Hair&quot; song &quot;Where Do I Go?&quot; in its Grammy Award-winning &quot;Down with the King&quot;. Handsome Boy Modeling School (&quot;The Truth&quot;), DJ Vadim, DJ Premier and Oh No have all sampled the same segment from &quot;Coffee Cold&quot;, from &quot;Shapes of Rhythm&quot; (1966).

Scottish electronica duo Boards of Canada used a loop in their track &quot;Aquarius&quot; (&quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot;) which was sampled from MacDermot&#x27;s song of the same name from the 1979 soundtrack of the film &quot;Hair&quot;.

As part of his Special Herbs series, rapper MF DOOM sampled three MacDermot songs from &quot;Woman Is Sweeter&quot;: &quot;Cathedral&quot; for his song &quot;Pennyroyal&quot;, &quot;Space&quot; for &quot;Cinquefoil&quot;, and &quot;Princess Gika&quot; for &quot;Styrax Gum&quot;. &quot;Cathedral&quot; is also sampled in Westside Gunn&#x27;s &quot;Dear Winter Bloody Fiegs&quot; for his 2015 mixtape &quot;Hitler Wears Hermes 3&quot;. In 2006, rapper and producer Oh No released an album produced completely with MacDermot samples, titled &quot;Exodus into Unheard Rhythms&quot;.

<text>Bolshevik Island (, ) is an island in Severnaya Zemlya, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russian Arctic. The island is named after the political faction of the Soviet Union.

==History==
The island, together with the eastern coast of what was named Emperor Nicholas II Land, was discovered by Boris Vilkitsky at the time of the 1913 Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition. Its insularity, however, wasn&#x27;t proven until 1931, when Georgy Ushakov and Nikolay Urvantsev charted the archipelago during their 1930–32 expedition.

Prima Polar Station, currently the only Polar station operating in Severnaya Zemlya, is located in this island near Cape Baranov.

==Geography==
It is the southernmost island and the second largest island in the group. The area of this island has been estimated at . The island is mountainous reaching a height of 935 m. About 31% of Bolshevik Island, totaling over , is covered by glaciers, the largest are Leningrad Glacier, Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky Glacier, Kropotkin Glacier, Mushketov Glacier and Aerosyomki Glacier. Most of these ice formations do not reach the sea, ending in moraines in valleys or coastal plains having a sparse vegetation of moss and lichen.

<text>The Fortunate Isles or Isles of the Blessed (, &quot;makarōn nēsoi&quot;) were semi-legendary islands in the Atlantic Ocean, variously treated as a simple geographical location and as a winterless earthly paradise inhabited by the heroes of Greek mythology. In the time of Hesiod, the Fortunate Isles were associated with the concept of Elysium, a utopian location in the Greek underworld thought to be found in the Western ocean on the margin of the known world. The number of the islands would later be reduced to one by the poet Pindar. 

==Legend==
According to Greek mythology, the islands were reserved for those who had chosen to be reincarnated three times, and managed to be judged as especially pure enough to gain entrance to the Elysian Fields all three times. The Theban poet Pindar reduced the number of the islands to one, describing it as having shady parklands with residents indulging in athletic and musical pastimes, activities that were thought to be the ideal life for ancient Greek aristocracy.

==Accounts==
Flavius Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; (v.2) says, &quot;And they also say that the Islands of the Blessed are to be fixed by the limits of Libya where they rise towards the uninhabited promontory.&quot; In this geography Libya was considered to extend westwards through Mauretania &quot;as far as the mouth of the river Salex, some nine hundred stadia, and beyond that point a further distance which no one can compute, because when you have passed this river Libya is a desert which no longer supports a population.&quot;

Plutarch, who refers to the &quot;fortunate isles&quot; several times in his writings, locates them firmly in the Atlantic in his &quot;vita&quot; of Sertorius. Sertorius, when struggling against a chaotic civil war in the closing years of the Roman Republic, had tidings from mariners of certain islands a few days&#x27; sail from Hispania:
It was from these men that Sertorius learned facts so beguiling that he considered retiring from Roman political life altogether to these islands, but conflicts to come prevented him from pursuing this rumour further.
Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; adds to the obligatory description—that they &quot;abound in fruit and birds of every kind&quot;—the unexpected detail that, &quot;[t]hese islands, however, are greatly annoyed by the putrefying bodies of monsters, which are constantly thrown up by the sea&quot;.

The Isles are mentioned in Book II of &quot;A True History&quot; by the Greek satirist Lucian of Samosata. The author makes fun of the heroes residing there by giving an account of their petty squabbles as presented to the court of the magistrate, Rhadamanthus. He goes on to describe other observations of how the residents occupy their time, using every opportunity to satirise both contemporary life and Greek mythology.

Ptolemy used these islands as the reference for the measurement of geographical longitude and they continued to play the role of defining the prime meridian through the Middle Ages.

<text>Brookfield Properties is a North American subsidiary of commercial real estate company Brookfield Property Partners, which itself is a subsidiary of alternative asset management company Brookfield Asset Management. It is responsible for the asset management of the company&#x27;s real estate portfolio, including office, multi-family residential, retail, hospitality, and logistics buildings. Brookfield Properties acquired General Growth Properties, one of the largest mall operators in the U.S., and merged it into Brookfield Properties in 2018. As of 2024, Brookfield Properties operates corporate offices in nine countries around the world, including China, India, Germany and the US. 

== History ==

The company&#x27;s roots go back to the early 1900s in Montreal, Quebec. It was known then as the Canadian Arena Company and operated the Montreal Arena. In a partnership with Toronto investors, it built Arena Gardens in Toronto. In the 1910s, it opened an office and began business in Brazil, while in the 1920s, it built the Montreal Forum to house the Montreal Maroons and Montreal Canadiens National Hockey League franchises; from 1935 to 1957, the company also owned the Canadiens. The company was acquired by Edper Investments in 1970. During the 1970s, when the company was known as Carena Properties, it expanded its business into commercial real estate. After the Montreal Forum closed, the Forum was sold to competitor Canderel Properties.

In 1989, Carena acquired a 33% interest in Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., developers of the World Financial Center in New York, and in 1990, Brookfield acquired a 50% interest in a portfolio of office properties in Toronto, Denver and Minneapolis from BCE Development Corporation. In 1994, this holding was increased to 100% and included BCE Place, now Brookfield Place, Brookfield Properties&#x27; flagship office complex in Toronto.

In 1996, Carena acquired a 46% interest in World Financial Properties, a corporation formed from the bankruptcy of Olympia &amp; York, which included three of the four towers of the World Financial Center, One Liberty Plaza, 245 Park Avenue in Manhattan. That year, Carena changed its name to Brookfield Properties Corporation.

In 1997, Brookfield Properties purchased 45% of Gentra, Inc., owner of several commercial properties in Toronto.

===2000s===
In 2000, Brookfield Properties acquired a portfolio of Calgary office properties, including the Bankers Hall complex.

In April 2001, the company lost out to Silverstein Properties, Inc., on the lease of the World Trade Center in New York City before the complex was destroyed during the September 11 attacks.

In 2003, Brookfield Properties completed the spin-off of Brookfield Homes, now part of Brookfield Residential, Brookfield Asset Management&#x27;s U.S.-based home building business.

In 2005, Brookfield Properties acquired a 25% interest in O&amp;Y Properties Corporation and O&amp;Y Real Estate Investment Trust, expanding the company&#x27;s real estate portfolio in four Canadian cities.

In 2006, the company acquired Trizec Properties, which was founded in 1960 by William Zeckendorf, builder of Place Ville Marie.

===2010s===
In 2010, it entered into London and Australian markets by acquiring the 100 Bishopsgate development site in the City of London and 16 properties encompassing 8 million SF in three major Australian cities.

On Earth Day on April 22, 2010, the company was listed as one of Canada&#x27;s &quot;The Green 30&quot; Organizations Based On Eco-Friendly Programs and Practices based on an employee poll.

In 2011, Brookfield Properties divested its residential group consisting of Carma Developers and Brookfield Homes (Ontario) Ltd. to merge with Brookfield Homes Corporation to form Brookfield Residential Properties Inc. That same year, Brookfield Properties changed its name to Brookfield Office Properties to reflect its focus on commercial office properties.

In 2013, Brookfield Office Properties Inc. became the largest office landlord in Los Angeles after acquiring MPG Office Trust Inc.&#x27;s downtown portfolio. MPG had been one of Southern California&#x27;s most prominent real estate developers and a longtime L.A. office tower owner. The MPG buildings they acquired include the Gas Company Tower, 777 Tower and the Wells Fargo Center on Bunker Hill.

In June 2014, Brookfield Property Partners (BPY) completed their acquisition of Brookfield Office Properties (BPO). BPO common shares were de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange as of June 10, 2014, and from the New York Stock Exchange on June 20, 2014. Brookfield Property Partners is now the sole owner of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of BPO.

In January 2016, Brookfield Properties purchased KIC, along with KIC&#x27;s Berlin office.

In 2016, Brookfield Asset Management, which owned 33 percent of Rouse Properties, made an unsolicited offer to purchase the rest of the company. A purchase agreement was eventually reached, valuing the company at $2.8 billion. Brookfield&#x27;s acquisition of Rouse Properties was completed on July 6, 2016. The Rouse Properties brand would ultimately be absorbed into Brookfield.

On August 28, 2018, Brookfield Property Partners acquired Chicago-based real estate investment trust and shopping mall operator GGP Inc. (General Growth Properties), and merged its assets into Brookfield Properties, for $9 billion. Brookfield immediately sold a 49% interest in each of three former GGP super-regional malls to CBRE Group, and a 49% interest in three other former GGP malls to TIAA subsidiary Nuveen, seeking additional joint ventures for its newly acquired malls. The acquisition added 162 shopping malls comprising approximately of gross leasable area to Brookfield&#x27;s portfolio.

In December 2018, Brookfield Properties took over the management of Forest City Realty Trust&#x27;s real estate portfolio after the company was acquired by a fund affiliated with Brookfield Asset Management.

=== 2020s ===
In September 2020, the company&#x27;s retail group announced a layoff of 20% of its workforce of about 2,000 people.

Around June 2021, the company opened an office in Sydney, Australia.

In May 2023, Brookfield Properties announced a purchase of a 115,000 square foot Doral warehouse at 1500 Northwest 95th Avenue for $16 million.

In January 2023, Brookfield Properties purchased subsidiaries from Deutsche Bank A.G., acquiring Deutsche Bank&#x27;s London and New York offices.

==Zuccotti Park==
The company is the owner of Zuccotti Park, a publicly accessible park adjacent to one of its office buildings near Wall Street in the Manhattan borough of New York City, that in September 2011 became a site of protests by Occupy Wall Street. On October 11, 2011, Richard Clark, the company&#x27;s CEO, sent a letter to NYC Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly requesting to &quot;clear the park&quot; as its use by Occupy Wall Street &quot;violates the law, violates the rules of the Park, deprives the community of its rights of quiet enjoyment to the Park, and creates health and public safety issues.&quot; The request was later withdrawn. The park was reopened on November 11, 2011.

<text>Liu Xiang (; born July 13, 1983) is a Chinese former 110 meter hurdler. Liu is an Olympic Gold medalist and World Champion. His 2004 Olympic gold medal was the first in a men&#x27;s track and field event for China.

Liu is one of China&#x27;s most successful athletes and has emerged as a cultural icon. On top of being the only male athlete in history to be all of 110-metre hurdles World Record Holder, World Champion and Olympic Champion—Liu remains the Olympic record holder for the men&#x27;s 110-metre hurdles with a time of 12.91 seconds he set back at the 2004 Athens Olympics. He was the favorite to win another gold in the 110 metre hurdles at the Beijing Olympics, but he had to withdraw from competition at the last moment after a false start and aggravation to a previously unrevealed injury. Again a gold medal favourite in the 110 metre hurdles at the London Olympics he pulled his Achilles tendon attempting to clear the first hurdle in the heats. On April 7, 2015, he announced his retirement on Sina Weibo.

==Career==

===Early career===
In May 2001, Liu won at the East Asian Games in Osaka, Japan with a time of 13.42 seconds. In August 2001, he won at the Universiade in Beijing with a time of 13.33 seconds. He also won at the 2001 National Games of China that same year.

In 2002 Liu set an Asian record time at the Athletissima meeting, completing the event in 13.12 seconds. This also broke Renaldo Nehemiah&#x27;s long standing and world junior record, which had stood for almost 25 years. The following year he secured bronze medals in the 60 metres hurdles at the 2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the 110 m hurdles at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics.

===2004 Olympics===
In May 2004 at an IAAF Grand Prix race in Osaka, Japan, Liu managed to beat Allen Johnson with a personal best record time of 13.06 seconds. He improved even further at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Although he was not considered a favourite for the event, he won the Olympic final by some distance to pocket the gold medal with 12.91 seconds, tying the world record set by Colin Jackson 11 years before. This was a new Olympic record and was almost three tenths of a second faster than the runner-up Terrence Trammell. The performance had Liu the sixth man to run under 13 seconds for the event and was China&#x27;s first men&#x27;s Olympic gold medal in a track and field event. On top of this, it defied the traditional thinking that Asian athletes could not compete in sprint events at the top level. He said that his gold medal &quot;changes the opinion that Asian countries don&#x27;t get good results in sprint races. I want to prove to all the world that Asians can run very fast.&quot;

Liu, a 21-year-old East China Normal University student at the time of victory in Athens, became the target of a bidding war among commercial sponsors. The Chinese Track and Field Association limited him to four such deals.

Liu finished the season with four of the year&#x27;s ten fastest clockings. Reaching 17 finals in the 60-metre indoor and 110-metre outdoor hurdles, he lost just two, both to American Allen Johnson.

===2005 and 2007 World Championships===
In August 2005, Liu won a silver medal at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, Finland, finishing 13.08 seconds, 0.01 second after champion Ladji Doucouré from France. In November 2005, he won at East Asian Games in Macau, China, with 13.21 seconds.

Off track, in May, Liu was awarded the Laureus World Sports Award for Newcomer of the Year for his breakthrough performance at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

On July 11, 2006, Liu set a new world record in the 110 metre hurdles at the Super Grand Prix in Lausanne with a time of 12.88 seconds (+1.1 m/s tailwind). The record was ratified by the IAAF. In that same race, American Dominique Arnold had also beaten the previous record with a time of 12.90 seconds.
In September, he won gold at IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart, Germany, with 12.93 seconds.

On August 31, 2007, at the World Athletics Championships in Osaka, Japan, Liu won gold in the 110-metre hurdles with 12.95 seconds to become World Champion.

On May 23, Liu participated in a test event at the Beijing National Stadium. He pulled out of the Reebok Grand Prix in New York on May 31, citing hamstring problems. On June 8, he false-started at the Prefontaine Classic at Eugene, Oregon. Liu skipped the entire European circuit, preferring to train for the Olympics in China instead.

===Beijing Olympics===
Leading up to the Summer Olympics in Beijing, Liu bore national expectations of a repeat victory on home soil. On August 18, Liu withdrew from the Olympic 110 metre hurdles. He walked off the track after a false start by another runner in his first-round heat, leaving the crowd at the Beijing National Stadium in stunned silence, confusion, and tears. According to Jeré Longman of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;China&#x27;s greatest hope had been dashed&quot;.

According to China&#x27;s track and field association, Liu suffered from a recurrence of chronic inflammation in his right Achilles tendon. Liu&#x27;s coach, Sun Haiping addressed the media during a press conference and stated that the hurdler had been hampered by a tendon injury for six or seven years. He commented on the situation, saying &quot;We worked hard every day, but the result was as you see and it is really hard to take.&quot; Sun, who was in tears for most of the press conference, stated that Liu would be unable to compete for the remainder of 2008. Liu made a public apology to the Chinese media the following day, saying he could &quot;do nothing but pull out of the race&quot; because of his foot injury. He believed that the injury would not prevent him from future competitions and vowed to &quot;come back&quot; for the next Olympics.

Liu&#x27;s injury was significant and also ruled him out of the following year&#x27;s major competition, the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. However, coach Sun Haiping was confident that he would return in time for the Chinese national championships and 2009 Asian Championships in Athletics in November.

===2009–2011: Return from injury===
After a 13-month absence because of his injury, Liu finally returned to competition at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. Liu recorded a time of 13.15, tied with Terrence Trammell, but finished 0.01 second behind and was awarded second place. However, Liu said he was happy with his performance. Nearing the end of the year, he competed at a number of major events on home turf. He won gold medals at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships, the East Asian Games and the 11th Chinese National Games.

At the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Doha, admitting that his right foot has yet to fully recover, Liu was able to finish in the finals of the 60 m hurdles, but managed only seventh place. His sole appearance on the 2010 IAAF Diamond League circuit came at the Shanghai Grand Prix and he lost to national rival Shi Dongpeng for the first time. Following a six-month break, he marked his return to form at the 2010 Asian Games. A crowd of 70,000 gathered at the Guangdong Olympic Stadium to see him in the final and he easily won his third consecutive title at the competition, breaking the Games record with a run of 13.09 seconds – making him the third fastest athlete that season.

The Shanghai Golden Grand Prix in May 2011 saw Liu make a return to a world class level: he defeated David Oliver (the fastest hurdler in 2010) with a world-leading mark of 13.07 seconds to take his first win on the 2011 IAAF Diamond League. Liu showed he had accomplished a transition in his technique, as he reduced his number of starting steps before the first hurdle from eight to seven, using his left leg for hurdling.

On August 29, 2011, Liu Xiang competed in the men&#x27;s 110-metre hurdles final in the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea. Liu finished the race in third place, but he eventually won the silver medal, as the winner Dayron Robles was disqualified for entering Liu&#x27;s lane and pulling him back.

===2012 season===
In Liu&#x27;s first competition of 2012, he was matched up against Dayron Robles at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix and this time he won cleanly with an Asian record time of 7.41 seconds for the 60 m hurdles. He was the favourite for the title at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, but was beaten into second place by Aries Merritt and left with the silver medal. In the outdoor season he set a 110 m hurdles meet record at the Golden Grand Prix Kawasaki, then ran 12.97 seconds to win at his home nation 2012 IAAF Diamond League meet, the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. This was his first run under 13 seconds since 2007, and he beat Americans David Oliver and Jason Richardson by some distance. He followed this with a run of 12.87 seconds to win at the Prefontaine Classic, matching the world record time albeit with wind-assistance of 2.4 m/s.

In the 110-metre hurdles at the London Olympics in 2012, Liu pulled his Achilles tendon while taking off and attempting to clear the first hurdle, instead crashing straight into it. Liu hopped the full 110 metre stretch, was helped by a few of his fellow competitors, and was put into a wheel chair and led away. He kissed the last hurdle before he left the track. Colin Jackson described it as a &quot;very sad sight indeed&quot; for the sport. Liu&#x27;s loss echoed strongly in the Chinese press but also sparked a lot of controversies. Some voices expressed support while others wondered why Liu chose to participate in spite of his injury. Liu even earned a nickname &quot;Liu PaoPao&quot; because of pullbacks in two consecutive Olympic Games. As per reports Liu was to have surgery on his Achilles tendon in Britain.

=== Retirement ===
On April 7, 2015, Liu announced his retirement in a statement posted to his Sina Weibo. He had not competed since the 2012 Olympic race. In his post, he wrote that he was retiring after two years of frustrating and ultimately futile rehabilitation: &quot;Of course my heart is still willing, but my foot has again and again said no to me.&quot;

In 2016, Liu was chosen as one of the teams in Shenzhen TV&#x27;s reality program &quot;The Amazing Race China 3&quot;. Liu was initially paired up with his cousin Ji Longxiang on the first two legs, but Ji was later replaced with his best friend Xu Qifeng for the remainder of the race. They finished in 3rd place overall.

==Personal life==
Liu is known for his low-profile appearance, but he has become one of the most popular athletes in China. 
Liu Xiang was on &quot;Time&quot; magazine Asian edition&#x27;s cover of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games titled &quot;Liu Xiang &amp; 99 More Athletes to Watch.&quot;

Liu donated approximately 2,500,000 yuan (364,000 USD) to 2008 Sichuan earthquake relief efforts.

Liu married Ge Tian, a post-90s generation actress on September 7, 2014, after officially dating the actress for two years prior to their marriage.
 They divorced in 2015. On January 9, 2016, Liu Xiang announced a new relationship with pole vaulter Wu Sha, in his Sina Weibo. On December 1, 2016, Liu and Wu held a low profile wedding ceremony in Fiji.

Liu&#x27;s athletic gear is sponsored by Nike. He is also a spokesperson for Coca-Cola and Cadillac.

<doc id="875822" wikidata="Q172959" url="?curid=875822" title="Photographic fixer">
<text>Photographic fixer is a mixture of chemicals used in the final step in the photographic processing of film or paper. The fixer stabilises the image, removing the unexposed silver halide remaining on the photographic film or photographic paper, leaving behind the reduced metallic silver that forms the image. By fixation, the film or paper is insensitive to further action by light. Without fixing, the remaining silver halide would darken and cause fogging of the image. 

== Chemistry ==
Fixation is commonly achieved by treating the film or paper with a solution of thiosulfate salt. Popular salts are sodium thiosulfate—commonly called hypo—and ammonium thiosulfate—commonly used in modern rapid fixer formulae. 
Fixation by thiosulfate involves these chemical reactions (X = halide, typically Br−):
:AgX + 2 S2O32− → [Ag(S2O3)2]3− + X−
:AgX + 3 S2O32− → [Ag(S2O3)3]5− + X−

In addition to thiosulphate the fixer typically contains mildly acidic compounds to adjust the pH and suppress trace amounts of the developer. This compound is often an alkali hydrogen sulfite (bisulfite) which also serves to preserve the thiosulphate. Less commonly it may also contain other additives e.g. for the hardening of gelatin. There are also non-thiosulphate fixers, at least for special purposes. Fixer is used for processing all commonly used films, including black-and-white films, Kodachrome, and chromogenic films.

==Chromogenic films==
In chromogenic films, the remaining silver must be removed by a chemical mixture called a bleach fix, sometimes shortened to &quot;blix&quot;. This mixture contains ammonium thiosulfate and ferric EDTA, a powerful chelating agent. The fixing agent reduces the silver which is then dissolved by the chelating agent.

==Washing and stabilisation== 
After fixation, washing is important to remove the exhausted chemicals from the emulsion. Otherwise they cause image deterioration. Other treatments of the remaining silver-based image are sometimes used to prevent &quot;burning&quot;.

<doc id="875829" wikidata="Q270008" url="?curid=875829" title="Lady Huang">
<text>Lady Huang, also known in fiction and folklore as Huang Yueying, was the wife of Zhuge Liang, the chancellor and regent of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Her name was not recorded in history; &quot;Huang Yueying&quot; is simply a fictional name. In tales, Lady Huang was, however, remarkable for her erudition, being learned in strategy, geography, astronomy, and divination. Zhuge Liang heard of her intelligence, and courted and married her.

==In historical records==
The only mention of Lady Huang in historical sources was in the &quot;Xiangyang Ji&quot; (襄陽記; &quot;Records of Xiangyang&quot;). In the fifth century, the account was added as an annotation by Pei Songzhi to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biography in the historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which was written by Chen Shou two centuries earlier.

The account stated that Huang Chengyan once told Zhuge Liang: &quot;I heard you are looking for a wife. I have an ugly daughter with yellow hair and dark skin, but her talent matches yours.&quot; Zhuge Liang then married Huang Chengyan&#x27;s daughter. At the time, there was a saying in their village: &quot;Don&#x27;t be like Kongming when you choose a wife. He ended up with A-cheng&#x27;s (referring to Huang Chengyan) ugly daughter.&quot;

==In folklore==

A story tells that Huang Yueying challenged her suitors to visit her personally by claiming that she was ugly. In the event that a suitor would visit her, she would hide herself under veils as a quiet dare to test their resolve. When Zhuge Liang came to her, her figure was silhouetted by moonlight and her head was covered with two red veils. Unlike other men, Zhuge Liang entered her room alone and did not hesitate in removing her disguises. As he removed the first veil from her face, he calmly stated that her ugliness was a misunderstanding by her father. Zhuge Liang was then rewarded by Huang Yueying&#x27;s joyful visage and gratification.

Folktales ascribe to her the creation of not only Zhuge Liang&#x27;s wooden ox and flowing horse but fantastic inventions, including cooking robots. Lady Huang did not long survive her husband, who died in 234 A.D. On her deathbed, she instructed her son Zhuge Zhan to &quot;be loyal and filial.&quot;

A memorial for her exists in her supposed hometown of Huangjiawan () in Yao&#x27;an Village () outside Xiangyang.

==In popular culture==
Huang Yueying is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. She is referred to as &quot;Yue Ying&quot; in the games up to &quot;Dynasty Warriors 7&quot;. Since &quot;Dynasty Warriors Next&quot; (on PS Vita) and &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot;, she is referred to as &quot;Yueying&quot; instead. She also appears in other games produced by Koei, such as &quot;Kessen II&quot; and all instalments of the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; strategy game series.

She also appears in various other video games, such as &quot;Hou Feng San Guo Online&quot;, &quot;Zong Heng San Guo Online&quot;, &quot;Meng Jiang Zhuan Online&quot;, and &quot;Qun Ying Fu Online&quot;.

She appears in the manga &quot;The War of Greedy Witches&quot;.

She is portrayed by Gui Gui in the Taiwanese television drama &quot;K.O.3an Guo&quot;, which spoofs the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; in a modern high school setting.

<doc id="875830" wikidata="Q164382" url="?curid=875830" title="Tavis Smiley">
<text>Tavis Smiley (; born September 13, 1964) is an American talk show host and author. Smiley was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, and grew up in Bunker Hill, Indiana. After attending Indiana University, he worked during the late 1980s as an aide to Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles.

Smiley became a radio commentator in 1991 and, starting in 1996, he hosted the talk show &quot;BET Talk&quot; (later renamed &quot;BET Tonight with Tavis Smiley&quot;) on Black Entertainment Television (BET). After Smiley sold an exclusive interview of Sara Jane Olson to ABC News in 2001, BET declined to renew his contract that year. Smiley then began hosting &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot; on National Public Radio (NPR) (2002–04) and hosted &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot; on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) on weekdays and &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot; on Public Radio International (PRI) from 2004 until 2017.

Smiley had an employment dispute with PBS in December 2017 which resulted in his suing PBS for wrongful termination. Smiley is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SmileyAudioMedia, Inc., headquartered in Los Angeles. Since June 2021 he has served as Chief Visionary Officer for his radio station, KBLA Talk 1580.

==Early life==
Smiley was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, the son of Joyce Marie Roberts. On September 13, 1966, his second birthday, his mother married Emory Garnell Smiley, a non-commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. A few years later Tavis learned the identity of his biological father, whom he identifies in his autobiography, &quot;What I Know For Sure: My Story of Growing Up in America&quot;, only as &quot;T&quot;.

Smiley&#x27;s family soon moved to Indiana when his stepfather was transferred to Grissom Air Force Base near Peru, Indiana. On arriving in Indiana, the Smiley family took up residence in a three-bedroom mobile home in the small town of Bunker Hill, Indiana. The Smileys had three more children and added four more after the murder of Joyce&#x27;s sister. Initially, four of her five children were cared for by their grandmother (known as &quot;Big Mama&quot;), but ill health impaired her ability, and Joyce and Emory took them in. The trailer home sheltered thirteen, including Tavis and his seven brothers and two sisters and the three adults.

Smiley&#x27;s mother was a deeply religious person, and the family attended the local New Bethel Tabernacle Church, part of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. The Smiley children were forbidden from listening to secular music at home or going to the movie theater, and could watch only television shows their parents felt were family-friendly.

When he was in seventh grade, New Bethel pastor Elder Rufus Mills accused Smiley and his siblings of &quot;running wild, disobeying their teacher, disrespecting their teacher, disrespecting the sanctity of this building, and mocking the holy message being taught&quot; during Sunday School. According to Smiley&#x27;s account of the incident, his Sunday School teacher became confused as she was answering questions about the Book of John, and other students &quot;responded by giggling and acting a little unruly,&quot; although he and his sister Phyllis &quot;remained quiet&quot;. Garnell whipped Tavis and Phyllis with an extension cord, wounding the two children. The next day at school, administrators found out about the children&#x27;s injuries. The local newspaper in Kokomo, Indiana, reported on the beating and the legal proceedings against Garnell; Tavis and Phyllis were sent to foster care temporarily. Garnell told his children that the judge decided that he had &quot;overreacted&quot; and found he and Joyce were &quot;concerned parents who were completely involved in [our] children&#x27;s lives and well-being&quot;.

Smiley became interested in politics at age 13 after attending a fundraiser for U.S. Senator Birch Bayh. At Maconaquah High School in Bunker Hill, Indiana, a school that Smiley described as &quot;98 percent white,&quot; he was active in the student council and the debate team, even though his parents were &quot;skeptical of all non-church extracurricular activities&quot;.

== Education ==
In 1982 Smiley enrolled at Indiana University Bloomington (IU). Because his parents refused to complete financial aid papers, Smiley entered the university with only $50 and a small suitcase. Administrators let Smiley complete the paperwork to become a full-time student. The summer after his first year, Smiley worked, attended summer classes, and lived off campus with Indiana Hoosiers men&#x27;s basketball players, then being coached by Bob Knight. Smiley was accepted into the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity during his second year, and became business manager of his dormitory, a member of the student senate, and director of minority affairs. After his friend Denver Smith was killed by Indiana police officers who claimed to have acted in self-defense, Smiley helped lead protests to defend Smith, who he believed had been wrongfully killed. Those protests led him to a work-study internship at the office of Bloomington Mayor Tomilea Allison, where he was paid $5 an hour. Smiley wrote letters to local residents, researched for Mayor Allison, and helped write position papers on local issues. In his autobiography, Smiley says that a deputy mayor caught him systematically adding extra hours to his time sheets, illegal behavior that could have seen him charged with a felony and expelled from college, but instead of pressing charges, Mayor Allison allowed him to work all of the hours for which he had already been paid, and did not tell other people what he had done.

During the first semester of his junior year, Smiley was under academic probation; he blamed his extracurricular activities for interfering with his studies. When Smiley visited Los Angeles to attend a national student leaders&#x27; convention, the cousin of his roommate introduced Smiley to football star Jim Brown. Brown introduced Smiley to fellow football player George Hughley, who worked for Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley and connected Smiley to Mayor Bradley&#x27;s staff. Every week after meeting Bradley&#x27;s staff, Smiley wrote a letter to the mayor&#x27;s office asking for an internship, and once flew to Los Angeles to appeal. However, by summer he received a letter from the city stating that all internship positions were filled. Smiley then handwrote a letter to the mayor that he said represented his feeling &quot;from the heart,&quot; and Bradley called Smiley to say that he had a position available for him. Although it counted for college credit, the internship was unpaid, so the Bloomington Community Progress Council funded Smiley with $5,000 for living expenses in Los Angeles, and Brown allowed Smiley to live as a houseguest in September 1985. Starting the following month, Smiley lived in the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity house at the University of Southern California. At City Hall, Smiley worked at the Office of Youth Development on the 22nd floor.

Smiley twice considered quitting college, first during his junior year, and then after finishing his internship with Mayor Bradley. Bradley persuaded Smiley to return to college. He took the LSAT twice because, he thought he &quot;didn&#x27;t do great the first time,&quot; and he &quot;did a little better&quot; the second time; he intended to apply to Harvard Law School. Instead, Smiley did not graduate from college at all, because he failed a required course in his senior year, and &quot;did poorly in several other courses,&quot; which meant he could not complete his degree on time; rather than stay for an extra term, he chose to leave IU and move to Los Angeles, where he had been promised a job. Following a hiring freeze by the government of Los Angeles, Smiley served as an aide to Mayor Bradley until 1990. A 1988 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; identified Smiley as &quot;a Bradley administrative assistant who works in South Los Angeles&quot;. In 2003, Smiley officially received his degree from Indiana University in public affairs.

== Career ==
===Radio commentator===

Campaigning for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council in 1991 against incumbent Ruth Galanter, Smiley finished fourth among 15 candidates. He became a radio commentator, broadcasting one-minute daily radio segments called &quot;The Smiley Report&quot; on KGFJ radio. With Ruben Navarrette Jr., Smiley co-hosted a local talk show in Los Angeles where his strongly held views on race and politics, combined with his arguments regarding the impact of institutional racism and substandard educational and economic opportunities for inner-city black youth, earned him attention at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. His commentaries focused on local and national current-affairs issues affecting the African-American community. For six months, Smiley worked on a community news program on a local cable network, and spent six more months working on television in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
From 2010 to 2013, Smiley and Cornel West worked together to host their own radio talk show, &quot;Smiley &amp; West&quot;. They were featured together interviewing musician Bill Withers in the 2009 documentary film &quot;Still Bill&quot;. He was the new host of &quot;Tavis Talks&quot; on BlogTalkRadio&#x27;s Tavis Smiley Network.

In 1996 Smiley became a frequent commentator to the &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;, a nationally syndicated radio show broadcast on black and urban stations in the United States. He developed a friendship with host Joyner.

=== BET Tonight show ===
Also in 1996 Smiley began hosting and executive producing &quot;BET Tonight&quot; (originally &quot;BET Talk&quot; when it first premiered), a public affairs discussion show on the Black Entertainment Television (BET) network. He interviewed major political figures and celebrities, and discussed topics ranging from racial profiling and police brutality to R&amp;B music and Hollywood gossip.

==== Firing from BET ====
Smiley hosted &quot;BET Tonight&quot; until 2001 when, in a controversial move, the network announced that Smiley&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. This sparked an angry response from Smiley, who sought to rally his radio audience to protest BET&#x27;s decision. Robert L. Johnson, founder of BET, defended the decision, stating that Smiley had been fired because he had sold an exclusive interview to ABC News without first offering the story to BET, even though Smiley&#x27;s contract with BET did not require him to do so. Smiley countered with the assertion that he had offered the story—an interview with Sara Jane Olson, an alleged former member of the Symbionese Liberation Army—to CBS, which, along with BET, was owned by Viacom. Smiley ultimately sold the interview to rival network ABC, he said, only after CBS passed on the interview, and suggested that his firing was payback for the publicity he gained as a result of providing an exclusive interview to ABC. Ultimately, BET and Viacom did not reverse their decision to terminate Smiley&#x27;s contract.

===NPR talk show===
Smiley was then offered a chance to host a radio talk show on National Public Radio. The Tavis Smiley Show was broadcast daily from January 2002 to December 16, 2004, in Los Angeles, when Smiley decided not to renew his contract with NPR. The show was a news and opinion program focusing upon issues of race, diversity, and ethnicity and often featured guest speakers. It was an hour-long show. Some of the reasons cited based on an article by Howard Kurtz for not renewing the contract were 1) Tavis Smiley wanted to tape his show a day in advance, and NPR did not agree; 2) against federal funding policies, Tavis Smiley wished to own the right to rebroadcast the show; and 3) Tavis Smiley appealed to have the budget for promoting the program significantly increased, and NPR did not have the budget to do so. It was announced in 2004 that he would be leaving his show, citing the network&#x27;s inability to reach a more diverse audience.

It was replaced on some radio stations by &quot;News &amp; Notes&quot; which follows much the same format and topics. Many other radio stations replaced it with the short-lived &quot;NPR News with Tony Cox&quot;.
==== Smiley leaves NPR ====
Smiley launched a weekly version of his radio program &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot; on April 29, 2005, distributed by NPR rival Public Radio International (PRI). It was a one-hour weekly program featuring interviews with news makers, thought leaders and artists and seeks to bring diverse perspectives to the airwaves. It was produced by Smiley Radio Properties, Inc., in partnership with PRI at Smiley&#x27;s studio in Los Angeles, California. The program ran two hours per week until October 2010 when the second hour became the sister program &quot;Smiley &amp; West&quot;, co-hosted by longtime Smiley collaborator Dr. Cornel West. The show ended after thirteen years of broadcast in December 2017.

===Move to PBS===
Smiley also hosted &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot;, a late night talk show televised on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) network and produced in association with WNET in New York.

In March 2006, &quot;The Smiley Group&quot; and Third World Press published &quot;The Covenant with Black America&quot;, a collection of essays by black scholars and professionals edited by Smiley. The book covers topics ranging from education to healthcare, and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller.

Smiley moderated two live presidential candidate forums in 2007: a Democratic forum on June 28 at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and a Republican forum on September 27 at Morgan State University in Baltimore.

=== Dancing with the Stars ===
On September 4, 2014, it was announced that Smiley would be competing on the 19th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He paired with professional dancer Sharna Burgess. They were eliminated on the second week of competition and finished in 12th place.

=== Firing from PBS ===
In 2017, Smiley was accused of violating the morals clause of his contract. Smiley denied the allegations and sued PBS citing wrongful termination. The court ultimately ruled in PBS&#x27;s favor, ordering that Smiley compensate PBS $2.6 million.

=== KBLA Radio ===
As of 2021, Smiley hosts a radio show on KBLA Talk 1580 from 9am to noon PT on weekdays, and he is also host of the &quot;Tavis Smiley Podcast&quot; in conjunction with KBLA.

==Media appearances==
In 2000, they began hosting annual town hall meetings called &quot;The State of the Black Union,&quot; which were aired live on the C-SPAN cable television network. Each of these town hall meetings focused on a specific topic affecting the African-American community, featuring a panel of African-American leaders, educators, and professionals, assembled before an audience, to discuss problems related to the forum&#x27;s topic, as well as potential solutions. Smiley also used his commentator status on Joyner&#x27;s radio show to launch several advocacy campaigns to highlight discriminatory practices in the media and government, and to rally support for causes such as the awarding of a Congressional Gold Medal to civil rights icon Rosa Parks. Smiley also began building a national reputation as a political commentator with numerous appearances on political discussion shows on MSNBC, ABC, and CNN. Smiley has appeared on the &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; podcast. and &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;.

==Controversy==
=== TSU dispute ===
In 2005, Smiley donated and raised thousands of dollars for Texas Southern University. The School of Communication was temporarily named after him, before TSU and Smiley mutually agreed to remove his name.

=== Barack Obama commentary ===
On April 11, 2008, Smiley announced that he would resign in June 2008 as a commentator on the &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;. He cited fatigue and a busy schedule in a personal call to Joyner. However, Joyner, referring to several commentaries in which Smiley was critical of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, indicated otherwise on his program, stating: &quot;The real reason is that he can&#x27;t take the hate he&#x27;s been getting regarding the Barack issue—hate from the black people that he loves so much.&quot; 

In 2012, Smiley participated in a &quot;Poverty Tour&quot; with Princeton University professor Cornel West to promote their book &quot;The Rich and the Rest of Us: A Poverty Manifesto&quot;. The stated aim of the tour was to highlight the plight of the impoverished population of the United States prior to the 2012 presidential election, whose candidates Smiley and West stated had ignored the plight of the poor.

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
On December 13, 2017, PBS indefinitely suspended Smiley. PBS issued a statement saying that it had hired a law firm to conduct an investigation &quot;immediately after learning of troubling allegations regarding Mr. Smiley&quot; and that this investigation &quot;uncovered multiple, credible allegations of conduct that is inconsistent with the values and standards of PBS.&quot;

On December 14, 2017, Smiley described the PBS investigation as &quot;biased and sloppy&quot; and said he would fight the allegations and the damage to his reputation. He released a statement saying, &quot;I have the utmost respect for women and celebrate the courage of those who have come forth to tell their truth&quot;, and &quot;To be clear, I have never groped, coerced or exposed myself inappropriately to any workplace colleague in my entire broadcast career, covering six networks over 30 years&quot;.

Soon after the suspension, Smiley went on a country-wide tour to defend his innocence and denouncing workplace harassment. In 2018, Smiley sued PBS for wrongful termination while PBS countersued claiming a breach of a morals clause in his contract. PBS prevailed and on August 5, 2020, Smiley was ordered to pay PBS $2.6 million in damages.

== Honorary degrees ==
Smiley was honored with the NAACP Image Award for best news, talk, or information series for three consecutive years (1997–99) for his work on &quot;BET Tonight with Tavis Smiley&quot;. Smiley&#x27;s advocacy efforts have earned him numerous awards and recognition including the recipient of the Mickey Leland Humanitarian Award from the National Association of Minorities in Communications. In 1999, he founded the Tavis Smiley Foundation, which funds programs that develop young leaders in the community. Since its inception, more than 6,500 young people have participated in the foundation&#x27;s Youth to Leaders Training workshops and conferences.

Created by writer David Michelinie and artist George Pérez, the character made his debut in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #195 (May 1980). Possessing photographic reflexes that allow him to mimic any fighting style at the cost of his long and short-term memory, he has served as an adversary of Marvel Universe superheroes such as Captain America, Ant-Man, and Spider-Man. He is usually depicted as a mercenary hired by criminal organizations to act as a training instructor. He is the biological father of Finesse.

The character has been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including several animated television series and video games. A female version of Taskmaster named [[Antonia Dreykov]] appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021), portrayed by Olga Kurylenko. Kurylenko will reprise the role in the upcoming film &quot;Thunderbolts*&quot; (2025).

In Marvel&#x27;s 2012–2015 rebranding, Marvel NOW!, Taskmaster joins a new incarnation of the Secret Avengers.

==Fictional character biography==

Taskmaster is a mysterious figure believed to have been born in the Bronx, New York City. He is able to mimic the physical movements of anyone he witnesses; writers differ on whether this counts as a &quot;super power&quot;. He claims to have had this ability since childhood. He is a combat instructor and part-time mercenary. Initially portrayed as a villain, he has also trained U.S. Agent and other neophyte superheroes at the behest of the U.S. government. As a mercenary, he has no ideology except that of his employer. Taskmaster has occasionally been used to impersonate other characters.

Tony Masters first demonstrated unusual abilities during childhood. After watching a cowboy show on television, he found himself able to duplicate sophisticated rope tricks, and later became a star high school quarterback after watching one NFL game. Psychiatrists explained Tony&#x27;s abilities to be a form of photographic memory dubbed &quot;photographic reflexes&quot;. Upon graduation, he briefly considered a career as a crime fighter, but opted for the purportedly more lucrative occupation of professional criminal.

He then began a program of observing the fighting techniques of numerous costumed heroes and villains (using archival television news broadcasts). He initially used his skills to execute several grand larcenies, but he had not properly anticipated the dangers involved. He decided to use his stolen capital to establish centers to turn aspiring criminals into polished professionals. His goal was to become a supplier for criminal organizations around the world.

Designing a costume with a white cowl and skull mask, Masters takes the name &quot;Taskmaster&quot; and begins training thugs at criminal academies across the United States. His existence was eventually revealed when Pernell Solomon of the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane (a front for one of these academies) uses the school&#x27;s resources to clone himself when the administrator required an organ donation, as he possessed a rare blood type. Learning of his intended death, the clone contacts the Avengers for help. Taskmaster captures Yellowjacket, the Wasp, and Ant-Man when the Avengers invade the school trying to rescue the clone, but the other Avengers follow, exposing his front operation. Taskmaster held his own against Captain America and Iron Man, but was forced to flee after a confrontation with Jocasta since his lack of experience with Jocasta&#x27;s abilities made it impossible to predict the robot&#x27;s next move. Taskmaster later established a new training academy in Manhattan, where he battled Spider-Man and Ant-Man, and then escaped. He later used a traveling carnival as a mobile base, where he battled Hawkeye and Ant-Man, and then escaped again. He next trained henchmen for the Black Abbott. Alongside Black Abbott, he battled Spider-Man and Nomad, and escaped yet again.

Deciding to further explore the use of a circus as a front for his academy, Taskmaster took over yet another small outfit, and used it for many months to great success. However, while it was playing a small town in Ohio, the Thing and Vance Astrovik (who would later take the name Justice) assisted a government agent in foiling Taskmaster&#x27;s activities. While escaping, Taskmaster was captured by a group of U.S. Secret Service agents and taken into custody. There is reason to believe that the Red Skull was behind the Taskmaster&#x27;s capture, since a group of normal men were able to capture him. Through Douglas Rockwell (the head of the President&#x27;s Commission on Superhuman Activities), Mr. Smith arranged for Taskmaster to train John Walker to make him appear to be the real Captain America. To conceal the Red Skull&#x27;s involvement, Rockwell had the Commission work out a deal to have years taken off Taskmaster&#x27;s sentence in return for training Walker. After Taskmaster successfully trained Walker in Rogers&#x27; fighting style and the use of a shield, the Red Skull arranged for him to escape from the Commission&#x27;s detention center so he could continue training lackeys and Red Skull himself.

Taskmaster&#x27;s more skilled, successful, and notable students include such characters as Crossbones and Cutthroat (both the Red Skull&#x27;s henchmen), U.S. Agent, Hauptmann Deutschland, Diamondback (Steve Rogers&#x27;s one-time girlfriend), Spymaster, Spider-Woman, and Agent X. On the other hand, Taskmaster also trains many of his students to serve as low-rent henchmen and cannon fodder. In his early appearances, Taskmaster mentions putting intellect-reducing drugs in the diet of his students. He also routinely sent groups of his more disappointing students to serve as &quot;sparring partners&quot; for the Red Skull, routinely engaging several of them at a time and killing them all (Hauptmann Deutschland infiltrated the academy and used one such session as an opportunity to kidnap Red Skull). He has also employed other supervillains, such as when he hired Anaconda as his academy&#x27;s calisthenics instructor.

On another occasion, Taskmaster was hired by the Triune Understanding — a religious group secretly masterminding a smear campaign to paint the Avengers as being religiously and racially intolerant — to stage an attack on a Triune facility. Posing as Captain America, he contacted Warbird, Ant-Man, Silverclaw and Captain Marvel, claiming that he needed their help to destroy a Triune building containing a mind-control machine. Although they saw through his deception and subsequently defeated him — thanks to Captain Marvel transforming into Rick Jones mere milliseconds away from Taskmaster, thus causing a complete change of attack before Taskmaster could react — the building was destroyed in the ensuing battle and Taskmaster escaped, leaving the heroes lacking any evidence of their story.

Taskmaster continued to train numerous villains and thugs until the Avengers began to search out and shut down some of his academies across the United States. Taskmaster began to spend more time working as a mercenary to make up for the loss of profit. This led him to join Agency X at the behest of his love interest Sandi Brandenberg, in missions from time to time, while continuing to teach at his academies around the world. More recently, Taskmaster is once again seen as a hired mercenary, contracted by the Committee to kill Moon Knight. Taskmaster was misled with information that Moon Knight was broken, friendless and desiring death. During the conflict these factors all proved to be false as Marc&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and butler came to Spector&#x27;s defense and found the will to fight back. Despite his superior fighting abilities, Taskmaster was defeated. Moon Knight then carved off part of Taskmaster&#x27;s facemask, though left him alive.

Taskmaster also worked at training henchmen to copy fighting styles of specific heroes. Taskmaster unleashed Deathshield (trained to fight like Captain America), Jagged Bow (trained to fight like Hawkeye), and Blood Spider (trained to fight like Spider-Man) to face off against Spider-Man and Solo. The three were defeated, while Taskmaster escaped yet again.

When the &quot;Civil War&quot; broke out, Taskmaster was hired by the government and enrolled into a team of Thunderbolts and given temporary amnesty to take down the Secret Avengers. He later battles the Secret Avengers in New York. He attempts to kill Susan &quot;Sue&quot; Storm, only for Reed Richards to take the bullet. Enraged, Sue crushes him with an invisible telekinetic field, rendering him unconscious. He was sent to the Negative Zone Prison with the other &quot;Major-League&quot; members of the Thunderbolts army such as Lady Deathstrike, but was apparently freed by Deadpool. To regain his own reputation as a mercenary, Deadpool frees Taskmaster from his imprisonment to have a showdown with him while potential merc contractors watched from their captive position in a nearby prison. Taskmaster is again referred to as Tasky by Deadpool, and a fight ensues between him and the manacled merc. He mentions his professional ethics, but this simply comes down to deciding to simply maim his opponent rather than kill him. In the end, he is defeated by Deadpool who, in spite of the victory, fails to impress his captive audience. After being thanked for letting him win, Taskmaster tells Deadpool that he had not let him win, &quot;The truth is... You&#x27;re that good. You&#x27;ve always been that good. Which won&#x27;t get you a cup of coffee until you figure out how to be a professional...&quot; Taskmaster was given a full presidential pardon for his efforts in testing the security of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, in which he was able to break in and place Deputy Director Maria Hill in his sights. Though he was allowed to leave, a threatening message left in Hill&#x27;s private bathroom revealed that if he ever desired, infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D. would be no difficult feat.

Taskmaster replaces Gauntlet as Camp Hammond&#x27;s drill instructor and is tasked with training registered superheroes for the . Taskmaster would also be involved in MVP&#x27;s cloning process inputting (via technology) the original&#x27;s move set for the Scarlet Spiders as well as the move set of Spider-Man.

Taskmaster is hired by Deadpool to help his old enemy and occasional friend defeat the Thunderbolts. Being disguised as Deadpool, he gets captured and is about to be beheaded when the real Deadpool saves him. Deadpool finally pays him, but he expresses annoyance at being paid from an ATM due to his major villain status.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Taskmaster is chosen to lead the Shadow Initiative after the Skrull invasion, with their first mission to take down Hardball&#x27;s HYDRA cell in Madripoor. Along with Constrictor, Bengal, Typhoid Mary and Komodo, Taskmaster stealthily leads the group into the country, but they are soon discovered by HYDRA. Norman Osborn appoints Taskmaster to train criminals for the new Initiative, to behave like heroes. His first task is to retrain Penance. Also, when Blastaar takes control of the Negative Zone prison 42, Taskmaster is ordered to lead a squad to take the prison back. Later, he gives Night Thrasher a severe bullet wound to the head, allowing Osborn to take Night Thrasher prisoner. When Emma Frost and Namor resign from the Cabal, Taskmaster is offered membership. Taskmaster was present at a meeting when Osborn discusses about Asgard. He is severely wounded at the meeting as a result of an attack by Doctor Doom. While recovering in a hospital, Taskmaster declined to join the Cabal. Osborn cut the oxygen tank next to Taskmaster&#x27;s bed, reminding him that it was Osborn who plucked him from obscurity. Taskmaster then agrees to join in the siege of Asgard. During the battle, he fights with both Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes as Captain America. As Asgard falls, Taskmaster finds Constrictor and the two beat a hasty retreat, but not before Taskmaster taunts Osborn about how Taskmaster helped Deadpool. After Osborn&#x27;s ultimate defeat, Taskmaster and Constrictor went back to mercenary work.

A false rumor is spread that Taskmaster is leaking information about the criminal underworld to Rogers&#x27;s new &#x27;heroic&#x27; regime. A bounty of $1,000,000,000 is placed on the Taskmaster&#x27;s head by the mysterious Org. The hordes of AIM, HYDRA, the Secret Empire, ULTIMATUM, the Cyber Ninjas, the Black Choppers, the Trenchcoat Mafia, the Legions of the Living Lightning, the Militiamen, the Sons of the Serpent, and the Inquisition take up the chase to claim the money. Taskmaster, ambushed in a small diner, manages to best his opponents. But the diner&#x27;s waitress, Mercedes Merced, gets entangled in the saga and is included in the bounty. Taskmaster reveals to Mercedes that his powers cause him to lose his explicit memory, meaning that he cannot remember anything about his personal life, and the only way for the whole ordeal to be over is to re-discover Taskmaster&#x27;s origins. Taskmaster and Mercedes&#x27; quest takes them to Mexico to battle the Don of the Dead, and then to Bolivia to the village where everyone is Hitler. Inside an exact replica of Himmler&#x27;s Wewelsburg Castle, Taskmaster regains his memories. He remembers being S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Tony Masters that had been sent to Bolivia to terminate Horst Gorscht, the Nazi scientist responsible for a corrupted version of the super-soldier serum. Gorscht had developed a new serum that could unlock the mind&#x27;s potential to absorb knowledge instantaneously. With Gorscht&#x27;s serum and test notes destroyed, Masters injected the last of the serum into himself. Having regained these memories, Taskmaster recognizes Mercedes&#x27; voice as being the same as &#x27;The Hub&#x27;, a mysterious voice who works for the Org. Taskmaster shoots Mercedes in the shoulder and threatens to kill her if she doesn&#x27;t start talking. Mercedes reveals that the Org is a S.H.I.E.L.D. front, and that she is not only an agent, but also Taskmaster&#x27;s wife. Miles above the Wewelsburg castle in an airship, the Minions&#x27; International Liberation Front (a secret group composed of henchmen from all of the major terrorist organizations), led by Redshirt the Uber-Henchman, reveal their deception and plot to rule the criminal underground by using Taskmaster to lead them straight to the Org. Redshirt leads the Minions&#x27; International Liberation Front (or the acronym MILF for short) into battle against the Taskmaster and Mercedes. Mercedes convinces the Taskmaster to trust her and work together to fend off the forces of MILF. During the battle, Taskmaster regains his memories of Mercedes and how he fell in love with her. Before they can reconcile, Taskmaster is attacked from behind by Redshirt who has genetically altered his body and mastered superior fighting skills to those of Taskmaster. Redshirt gains the upper hand as the pair push each other to the limits. Mercedes tries to intervene to protect her husband, but is quickly and effortlessly cast to one side. Enraged, Taskmaster attacks Redshirt and delivers a killing blow using Redshirt&#x27;s own fighting style (which causes Taskmaster to lose his memories once more). Taskmaster, not recognizing Mercedes or his reasons for being there, flees and leaves Mercedes alone once more.

Avengers Academy student Finesse later seeks out Taskmaster, thinking that he may be her long-lost father. When she finds Taskmaster, Finesse ends up sparring with him. After much sparring, Taskmaster finally relents to tell Finesse that he very well might be and most likely is her father, but that the powers to learn so much about others’ movements and techniques have caused him to forget important things in life. Knowing he likely will not remember the conversation in a couple days, Taskmaster tells Finesse that he wanted to fight her so he might remember her.

During the 2011 &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Taskmaster comes to the aid of Alpha Flight when it comes to forming a resistance against the Unity Party that was formed by Master of the World.

In order for the Masters of Evil to obtain the Crown of Wolves for the Shadow Council, Max Fury hired Taskmaster to retrieve it only for Taskmaster to demand more money for the job and he hid in the Hole. The Secret Avengers went to the Hole to get the Crown of Wolves before Fury got his hands on it. This led to a fight between Taskmaster and Agent Venom. However, Taskmaster escaped and returned the crown to Fury, only for Max to apparently kill Taskmaster when he asks for payment. When the crown&#x27;s effects don&#x27;t function for Max, Taskmaster takes the crown for himself, which saves his life by making him the Avatar for the Abyss. As the Abyss spreads, the Secret Avengers members Venom and Ant-Man are able to remove the crown and stop the spread, while Taskmaster and the Masters of Evil are left behind when the Avengers leave with Max in their custody.

The criminals of Bagalia imprison Taskmaster and are preparing to offer him up to the highest bidder. S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Secret Avengers come to rescue him and offer him a position. As their inside man, Taskmaster is part of the new High Council of A.I.M. as the Minister of Defense. Mockingbird later goes to A.I.M. Island to assist Taskmaster in helping make contact between the Iron Patriot A.I. drones and James Rhodes. After the mission goes south and Mockingbird is left stranded on AIM Island, Taskmaster works undercover to free her. But when he gets the chance to get her off the island, she doesn&#x27;t respond to anything he says until both are captured. While being interrogated, Taskmaster is shot and seemingly killed by Mockingbird apparently under the control of Scientist Supreme (Andrew Forson). However, Mentallo discovered that Mockingbird purposely missed any vitals and Taskmaster survived.

At the time when Captain America was brainwashed into being a Hydra sleeper agent by Red Skull&#x27;s clone using the powers of Kobik, Taskmaster later move to Bagalia where he became its sheriff.

When Taskmaster and Black Ant (Eric O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Life Model Decoy counterpart) found out what was done to Captain America to be made into a Hydra sleeper agent, they planned to have a parley with Maria Hill to discuss this with only for the new Madame Hydra (Elisa Sinclair) to get to them first.

Taskmaster and Black Ant later attack Empire State University where Curt Connors was teaching a class. As the inhibitor chip prevents Connors into turning into Lizard, Peter Parker sneaks off to become Spider-Man. During his fight with Black Ant and Taskmaster, Spider-Man is exposed to the Isotope Genome Accelerator that splits him from his Peter Parker side.

In a prelude to &quot;Hunted&quot;, Taskmaster and Black Ant work with Kraven the Hunter and Arcade in capturing some animal-themed characters for his upcoming hunt. After Spider-Man thwarted the hunt, Taskmaster and Black Ant got away.

During the &quot;King in Black&quot; storyline, Taskmaster is among the villains recruited by Mayor Wilson Fisk to lead his Thunderbolts at the time of Knull&#x27;s invasion.

At the conclusion of &quot;The Chameleon Conspiracy&quot; arc, Foreigner hired Taskmaster and Black Ant to help get revenge on Spider-Man.

During the &quot;Carnage Reigns&quot; storyline, Taskmaster joins Agent Gao&#x27;s Cape-Killers.

Taskmaster was at the Bar with No Name when Spider-Woman arrived. They went outside to fight as Spider-Woman gets the information on some of the thugs he recently trained.

As Captain America is transporting a specific cargo, his futuristic helicopter gets Spider-Boy as a passenger due to his spider-senses stating that Captain America needs help from Taskmaster. Captain America figures out that one of the soldiers is actually Taskmaster using an Image Inducer as the cargo in question is Super-Adaptoid. Even though Captain America and Spider-Boy fend off Taskmaster, he makes off with Super-Adaptoid&#x27;s left hand as he plans to give it to Killionaire. Taskmaster was later seen at Empire Unlimited getting reprimanded by Killionaire for not bringing all of Super-Adaptoid to him so that Shannon Stillwell can rebuild it into a suit that would give him the powers of the Avengers. When Killionaire threatened to dox Taskmaster and Shannon Stillwell, Killionaire was impressed with the latter reverse-engineering it to make the Toy Soldier that still can copy the abilities of all the Avengers and be remote-controlled by Killionaire. When Taskmaster asks for his cut, Killionaire takes Toy Soldier out for a test drive by having it attack Taskmaster.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Taskmaster was with Agent Gao&#x27;s Cape-Killers at the time when Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Misty Knight, and Colleen Wing defeated Bumbler&#x27;s group and Frost Pharaoh&#x27;s group.

==Powers and abilities==
Taskmaster injected himself with SS-Hauptsturmführer Horst Gorscht&#x27;s primer, an elaborate modification of the adrenal steroid cortisol designed to unlock the mind&#x27;s procedural memory potential. This increased Taskmaster&#x27;s natural ability to absorb knowledge. This ability is linked to his muscle memory, allowing Taskmaster to instantly replicate the physical movement of peak-level humans. Taskmaster cannot duplicate a physical feat that requires superhuman effort, like lifting a car. These &quot;photographic reflexes&quot; have made Taskmaster highly skilled in various forms of combat: martial arts (mimicking Elektra, Iron Fist, Shang-Chi), swordfighting (Black Knight, Silver Samurai, Swordsman), marksmanship (Captain America with a shield, Hawkeye with a bow and arrow, the Punisher with firearms, and Bullseye with various projectiles); he also displays a strenuously honed athletic ability (Black Panther, Daredevil, Spider-Man). Taskmaster can use every fighting style he has watched in any given fight. Once the Taskmaster has mastered an opponent&#x27;s physical movements, he can predict the next attack. A few people can negate Taskmaster&#x27;s abilities; among them are Deadpool, whose manic personality makes him nearly impossible to predict; Mister X, who uses his psychic abilities to get the better of Taskmaster in a fight; and Slapstick, whose flexible cartoony body causes Taskmaster to break his own spine upon copying the hero&#x27;s ability. A side effect of the primer is severe declarative memory loss. As he gains implicit memories (i.e., knowledge and abilities), he loses explicit memories (i.e., personal experiences). The Org (Mercedes Merced) has acted as Taskmaster&#x27;s surrogate memory, his banker, and his handler during his criminal career.

By viewing a video in fast-forward, Taskmaster can learn to replicate human movement at near-superhuman speed. However, this puts his body under intense strain and can only be used for short periods of time. He can manipulate his vocal cords to mimic others&#x27; voices. The Taskmaster is skilled in meditation techniques that allow him to slow his breathing and heart rate, allowing him to play dead or and survive for extended periods of time without air. He claims to have learned forensic methods from CIA agents and Mossad operatives. Taskmaster can use chi under exceptional circumstances. Taskmaster was once shown to have aquaphobia (the fear of water), but later overcame his fears.

===Weaponry===
Taskmaster carries many weapons. He most commonly uses a sword and a replica of Captain America&#x27;s shield, but also carries a bow and a quiver of arrows, a billy club, a lasso, nunchaku, throwing darts, and various firearms. Taskmaster once used a stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. device that was able to create various forms of weaponry (such as arrows and shields) using solid energy.

==Other versions==

<text>The China National Highways (CNH/Guodao) () is a network of trunk roads across mainland China. Established to facilitate transportation and economic development, the system includes north-south and east-west arterial highways, expressways, and local roads. By 2024, the network encompasses over 1.9 million kilometers of highways, making it one of the most extensive in the world. Key milestones include the completion of major expressways by 2008 and ongoing expansions to enhance connectivity, especially in western and less developed areas.

Apart from the expressways of China that were planned and constructed later, most of the CNH are not controlled-access highways. 

== History ==

The building of highways is seen as key to accelerating infrastructure construction. In 2003, completed investment in highway construction was 350 billion yuan and 219 key highway projects progressed, focusing mainly on the five north–south and seven east–west national arterial highways as well as highways in western China and in rural areas. By the end of 2004, the total length of highways open to traffic reached 1.871 million km, including 34,300 km (21,300 mi) of expressways up to advanced modern transportation standard, ranking second in the world. The nation&#x27;s highway density was 19.5 km per 100 km2. With the completion in 2008 of the five north–south and the seven east–west national arterial highways, totaling 35,000 km (22,000 mi), Beijing and Shanghai were linked by major highways, chiefly expressways, to the capitals of all provinces and autonomous regions of China, creating highway connections between over 200 cities.

The aim of the National Expressway Network Plan approved in early 2005 is an expressway system connecting all capitals of provinces and autonomous regions with Beijing and with each other, linking major cities and important counties. The network will have a total length of about , including seven originating in Beijing; the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Taipei, Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau, Beijing-Kunming, Beijing-Lhasa, Beijing-Ürümqi, and Beijing-Harbin expressways. Half of the projects are already completed.

In 2013 the Ministry of Transport announced the &quot;National Highway Network Planning (2013 - 2030)&quot;, which will bring the total number of highways to 119, with 81 connecting highways between them. The total mileage will be increased to , with increased focus on the western and less developed regions.

In 2022, the NDRC and MOT published a new National Highway Network Plan (), which added and re-formed several expressways and national highways. The plan aims for all national highways to connect all county-level (or above) administrative regions (except those that are parts of Sansha), important national tourist attractions, and border checkpoints. 

== Regulation ==

The speed limit on China National Highways is , on sections with more than one lane per direction it may be up to .

Nationwide highways often begin with the letter GXXX, followed by three numerals, e.g.: G107. It is said that the GXXX stands for 国家 (&quot;guójiā&quot;), or national.

The numbering of the highways is as follows:

* Five vertical and seven horizontal main routes were labelled in the former 000 series (the so-called &quot;five downs and seven acrosses&quot;), although these have been deprecated in favour of the &quot;NTHS&quot; (7, 11, 18) system.
* Highways in the 100 series (e.g. 102, 106) begin from Beijing - the capital city of the People&#x27;s Republic of China - and spread out in all compass directions, except for China National Highway 112, which originates in Bazhou as it is a ring road around Jingjinji.
* Highways in the 200 series stretch from north to south (e.g., from Hohhot in Inner Mongolia through to Beihai in Guangxi province);
* Highways in the 300 series stretch from east to west (e.g., from Shanghai through to Ruili in Yunnan province);
* Highways in the 500, 600 and 700 series are connecting roads between other national highways.

In major cities, there is usually a gap in the road within the city.

== List of all China National Highways ==

=== Former 000 Series ===
Note: 000 Series China National Highways pointed to five specific vertical routes, as well as seven specific horizontal routes. Routes ending in &quot;0&quot; were north–south (vertical) routes; routes ending in &quot;5&quot; were east–west (horizontal) routes. The new system with two to four numbers that indicate the &quot;NTHS&quot; (7918) system is now in use instead of the 000 Series. For the expressways named under the new numbering system, see Expressways of China.

It seems that the old 0xx numbers are still signposted using the format GZXX, e.g. in the Qinghai province, there are signs at the G109 (old G025) showing the number GZ25.

<text>The A4 motorway in Switzerland begins from Schaffhausen, in northern Switzerland, and travels southward into central Switzerland.
 of A4 is: Bargen - Schaffhausen - Winterthur - Zürich - Central Switzerland.

== Route description ==
 out as an Autostrasse road at the border crossing Bargen / Neuhaus am Randen, at the border to Germany, crossing a suspension bridge at Schaffhausen over the Rhine, and continues through Zurich&#x27;s wine country to Winterthur. Between Winterthur and Zurich, the A4 runs together with the developed A1 Autobahn (motorway). From Zurich the branching east from the A4 and the A1 via the so-called Nordring the motorway interchange Limmattal, the motorway runs from where the A4 and A3, since 4 May 2009, joined to the Western Bypass of Zurich; until May 2009 this section ended for the motorway junction Birmensdorf. In November 2009 the opening of the A4 in Knonaueramt between the branches of Zurich West is planned, at Blegi Cham. From Blegi, the A4 goes on to Schwyz and ends as an Autostrasse road at Brunnen.

The continuation of the N4 national road that leads from Brunnen to Altdorf in the canton of Uri, has the status of a third-class national highway, with the physical role of a main road. The tunnel opened in 2005, is again shown as Flüelen Bypass Highway; yet the connection to the A2, however, remained as a non-main road intersection.

== Expansion projects ==
=== Mini-Highway Flurlingen Andelfingen ===

On 20 October 2006, the Swiss Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) started a project to strengthen the implementation of the two-lane national highway between Flurlingen and Andelfingen, officially approved as a four-lane mini-freeway. The expansion will cost about 140 million Swiss francs. Thus the large volume of traffic is taken into account.

In the summer of 2007, construction work began on the mini-freeway. The completion and release of the developed part is planned for 20 October 2010.

=== Mini Highway Andelfingen branching Winterthur North ===

According to a media release from the Federal Roads Authority (Winterthur branch), for the year 2014/2015, the expansion of the previously two-lane section of Route Andelfingen to Winterthur North Branch, into a four-lane mini-freeway, is also officially approved.

=== Galgenbucktunnel ===
In May 2007, the Government of the Canton Schaffhausen presented the design project for the Galgenbuck-tunnel. The tunnel serves as a two-lane bypass the town of Neuhausen Rhine Falls. Currently, over 25,000 vehicles travel daily through Neuhausen. After commissioning, it will be only half the traffic. The tunnel has been listed since 1970 in the master plan.

 the A4 will create a long tunnel with a slope of 4.5 percent, through the Galgenbuck Klettgau to the main road into the 13th link with the A4 intersections. In the service duct beneath the roadway, an escape tunnel has been built. Since this law concerns the transformation of a motorway connection, the federal government provides, under the new system of financial and division of tasks between the Confederation and the cantons, the full costs of approximately CHF 175 million. Construction is planned for summer 2010, with entry into service in 2014.

== Reclassifying main road 15 as a national road ==

At the federal level, under the title &quot;development of the national road network&quot; (a revision of the WHO, &quot;the Federal Decree&quot;) work has been performed on the national road network since 21 June 1960. During the consultation, the Federal Council in mid-2008 had invited the cantons to submit comments.

The so-called &quot;New network decision&quot; provides for the adjustment of the road network in the canton of Schaffhausen before the actual transit traffic. Ending on barges crossing the national highway 4 is obtained on the German side of any road performance, the transit traffic in the direction of Stuttgart, called on the cantonal main road 15 (J15), carried out through the border crossing Thayngen, and then removed from the German federal highway 34, which for Bundesautobahn 81 leads.

The main road 15 is, therefore, planned for 1 January 2010 from the junction to the border Mutzentäli Thayngen / Bietingen to be reclassified to the National Road, and the N4 today in return from the connector Schaffhausen Swiss border, to Bargen / Neuhaus am Randen, will be reclassified as the cantonal main road. The castling of the J15 shall be known N4/A4; the N4 is the new main road 4, while the old main road 4 can be in turn re-classified as the side street.

The Canton of Schaffhausen agreed in principle to the project, with the opinion on 15 September 2008 unanimously (69: 0 votes) adopted. Since the cantonal constitution in the case of the planned new recording of a main road into the national motorway network also requires a referendum for an opinion, this was held on 30 November 2008 and by 88.9% Yes votes (23,974: 2,988 votes) also confirmed.

Compared to the previous state, with the &quot;new network&quot; decision, the national motorway network in the canton of Schaffhausen, is approximately shorter. The compensation-eligible main-road network has increased, however, due to the slightly longer course of the N4 towards the H4, and the inclusion of Klettgau Street (Hauptstrasse 13), as a longer total of .

The connections to the present main road number 15 are incorporated into the existing system of N4/A4. The future course is:

* Border-crossing Thayngen/Bietingen
* Rest station Schwyzerland
* Thayngen (1)
* Rest area Berg
* Kesslerloch (1a)
* Rest area Moos
* Schaffhausen Herblingen (2)
* Schaffhausen Schweizersbild (2a)
* Junction Mutzentäli (3)

<doc id="875845" wikidata="Q736690" url="?curid=875845" title="Lu Kang (Eastern Wu)">
<text>Lu Kang (226 – August or September 274), courtesy name Youjie, was a Chinese military general and politician of the state of Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was the second son of Lu Xun, the third Imperial Chancellor of Wu. Lu Kang inherited his father&#x27;s mantle but was less involved in politics as he served mainly in the Wu military. He rose to prominence during the reign of the fourth and last Wu emperor, Sun Hao. In 272, he successfully suppressed a rebellion by Bu Chan and fended off invading forces from Wu&#x27;s rival, the Jin dynasty. After the Battle of Xiling, he actively pursued a policy of &quot;détente&quot; with the Jin general Yang Hu at the Wu–Jin border. At the same time, he constantly submitted memorials to Sun Hao, urging the tyrannical emperor to change his ways and govern with benevolence, but his advice fell on deaf ears. In 280, about six years after Lu Kang&#x27;s death, the Jin dynasty launched a campaign against Wu and conquered it within six months.

==During Sun Quan&#x27;s reign==
Lu Kang was the second son of Lu Xun and a maternal grandson of Sun Ce, the elder brother and predecessor of Wu&#x27;s founding emperor, Sun Quan. Lu Xun died in 245 when Lu Kang was around 19 years old. After his father&#x27;s death, Lu Kang was commissioned as Colonel Who Establishes Martial Might () and put in charge of 5,000 troops who had been under his father&#x27;s command. After escorting his father&#x27;s coffin from Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) back to his ancestral home in Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) for burial, he traveled to the Wu capital Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu) to pay his respects to Sun Quan. In Jianye, Sun Quan showed Lu Kang a list of 20 offenses Lu Xun allegedly committed and questioned Lu Kang about them. He did not allow Lu Kang to meet anyone and interrogated him together with a panel of officials. Lu Kang cooperated and responded truthfully. Sun Quan&#x27;s anger toward Lu Xun gradually subsided.

In 246, Lu Kang was promoted from Colonel to General of the Household () and ordered to switch posts with Zhuge Ke: he would leave Wuchang and move to Chaisang (柴桑; around present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) while Zhuge Ke would do vice versa. Before Lu Kang left, he had the city walls repaired and his residence renovated while leaving his fruit orchards intact. When Zhuge Ke arrived in Chaisang, he was surprised to see that Lu Kang had left behind a well-maintained residence for him. He also felt ashamed because his garrison at Chaisang was in poor condition when he departed.

In 251, Lu Kang fell ill and went to Jianye for medical treatment. When his condition improved and he was preparing to leave, Sun Quan came to bid him farewell. With tears in his eyes, Sun Quan told Lu Kang: &quot;Previously, I believed slanderous rumors and failed to understand your father&#x27;s well-meaning advice. I have let you down. I have burned all the documents containing the allegations against your father so that nobody can ever see them.&quot;

==During the reigns of Sun Liang and Sun Xiu==
Sun Quan died in 252 and was succeeded by his youngest son, Sun Liang, as emperor of Wu. After his coronation, Sun Liang promoted Lu Kang to the rank of General under the title &quot;General of Vehement Might&quot; (). In 257, Zhuge Dan, a general from Wu&#x27;s rival state Wei, started a rebellion in Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui) and requested reinforcements from Wu. Sun Liang appointed Lu Kang as the Area Commander of Chaisang (柴桑; around present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) and ordered him to lead troops to Shouchun to support Zhuge Dan. Although the rebellion was ultimately suppressed by Wei forces, Lu Kang managed to defeat some Wei forces in battle. In recognition of his efforts, the Wu government promoted him to the position of General Who Attacks the North ().

In 259, during the reign of Sun Liang&#x27;s successor Sun Xiu, Lu Kang was appointed as General Who Guards the Army () and placed in charge of Xiling (西陵; around present-day Yichang, Hubei). The area under his jurisdiction covered the lands from Guan Yu&#x27;s Shallows to Baidicheng. Sun Xiu granted him acting imperial authority in the following year.

==Early career under Sun Hao==
Sun Xiu died in 264 and was succeeded by his nephew Sun Hao as the emperor of Wu. Sun Hao promoted Lu Kang to the position of Senior General Who Guards the Army () and appointed him as the nominal Governor of Yi Province () even though Yi Province was not Wu territory. After the Wu general Shi Ji died in 270, Sun Hao put Lu Kang in charge of overseeing military affairs in Xinling (), Xiling (), Yidao (), Le District (), and Gong&#x27;an counties, with his administrative centre at Le District (east of present-day Songzi, Hubei).

===Proposing 17 policy changes===
When Lu Kang heard that there were many flaws in the Wu government&#x27;s policies, he became worried so he wrote a memorial to Sun Hao as follows: The 17 policy changes proposed by Lu Kang were lost over time.

===Speaking up against corruption in the Wu government===
When the official He Ding () was abusing his authority and eunuchs were interfering in state affairs, Lu Kang wrote a memorial to advise Sun Hao: 

==Battle of Xiling==
===Initial stages===
In 272, Bu Chan, the military commander stationed at Xiling (西陵; around present-day Yichang, Hubei), started a rebellion against Wu and wanted to defect to the Jin dynasty. When Lu Kang received news of the revolt, he immediately ordered his subordinates Zuo Yi (), Wu Yan, Cai Gong () and others to lead separate forces and head towards Xiling as directly as possible. He instructed his men to construct defensive structures all the way from Chixi () to Gushi () to form an encirclement around Bu Chan&#x27;s position, while at the same time defending the area from attacks by Jin forces. He ordered them to work day and night to complete the construction works as if the enemy had already arrived, resulting in his soldiers being all tired and worn out.

Lu Kang&#x27;s subordinates said: &quot;With our current strength, we can attack Bu Chan and destroy him before Jin forces arrive. Why are we exhausting ourselves by constructing defensive structures instead?&quot; Lu Kang explained: &quot;Xiling&#x27;s fortifications are very stable and it has sufficient supplies. Besides, I was the one who oversaw the construction of Xiling&#x27;s defences. If we attack it now, I don&#x27;t think we can conquer it easily. If Jin forces show up and we don&#x27;t have adequate defensive structures, we will be trapped in between Bu Chan and Jin and have nothing to protect ourselves from the enemy.&quot; The officers repeatedly urged Lu Kang to attack Xiling but he refused. Eventually, Lei Tan (), the Administrator of Yidu Commandery, came to see Lu Kang and used kind words to persuade him to attack Xiling. To prove that he was right, Lu Kang relented and ordered an assault on Xiling. As he expected, they did not succeed in capturing the city, so his officers gave up their idea of attacking and complied with Lu Kang&#x27;s orders to construct the defensive structures.

===Destruction of the dyke near Jiangling===
When Jin forces led by Yang Hu were approaching Jiangling County, the Wu officers advised Lu Kang against leaving Jiangling to attack Xiling, but Lu Kang said: &quot;Jiangling&#x27;s fortifications are strong and it has sufficient troops to defend it, so there is no need to worry. Even if the enemy captures Jiangling, they won&#x27;t be able to hold it for long and our losses will be minimal. However, if we lose Xiling, the tribes in the southern hills will be affected and this will lead to serious problems. I&#x27;d rather abandon Jiangling than give up on capturing Xiling. Besides, Jiangling is already very well-defended in the first place.&quot;

Jiangling was situated on flat lands and was a very accessible location. However, Lu Kang later ordered Zhang Xian () to oversee the construction of a large dyke to block the river&#x27;s flow and direct its waters to flood the flat lands, so as to create a large body of water around the city to serve as a barrier to invaders. When Yang Hu arrived, he planned to make use of this barrier by transporting supplies on boats, but he spread false news that he intended to destroy the dyke to make way for his land army to pass through. When Lu Kang heard that, he saw through Yang Hu&#x27;s plot and ordered Zhang Xian to destroy the dyke. Lu Kang&#x27;s officers were shocked and attempted to dissuade him from doing so because they thought he would be doing the enemy a favour, but Lu Kang ignored them. When Yang Hu reached Dangyang (當陽; southwest of present-day Jingmen, Hubei), he was dismayed to hear that the dyke had been destroyed. He had no choice but to transport his supplies on land, resulting in the wasting of time and effort.

===Final stages===
Xu Yin (), the commander of the Jin garrison at Badong Commandery (巴東郡; around present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing), led naval forces towards Jianping (建平; around present-day Zigui County, Hubei), while Yang Zhao (), the Inspector of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. 

Lu Kang gave orders that: Zhang Xian reinforce Jiangling&#x27;s defences; Sun Zun (), the Commandant of Gong&#x27;an County, patrol the south river bank and resist Yang Hu; and Liu Lü () and Zhu Wan () guard against Xu Yin&#x27;s attacks. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao with the aid of the defensive structures they had constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang&#x27;s subordinates Zhu Qiao () and Yu Zan () defected to Yang Zhao&#x27;s side. Lu Kang said: &quot;Yu Zan has been serving under me for a long time and he is very aware of my situation. He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow my orders, so he will definitely suggest to the enemy to take advantage of this weakness.&quot; Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang&#x27;s army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.

After about a month, Yang Zhao failed to overcome Lu Kang and had run out of ideas. So he withdrew his army on one night. Lu Kang wanted to pursue the enemy but he was worried that Bu Chan (who was still inside Xiling) might use the opportunity to attack him from behind, and he did not have enough troops with him. He then ordered his men to beat the drums and pretend to prepare to attack Yang Zhao&#x27;s retreating forces. When Yang Zhao&#x27;s men saw that, they were so terrified that they abandoned their armour and equipment and fled. Lu Kang sent a small group of lightly-armed soldiers to pursue Yang Zhao and they inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy. Yang Hu and the other Jin generals withdrew their armies after receiving news of Yang Zhao&#x27;s defeat. Lu Kang then attacked and conquered Xiling. Bu Chan, along with his family and high-ranking officers, were executed for treason, while the others, numbering over 10,000, were pardoned after Lu Kang made a request to the Wu court. Lu Kang then had Xiling&#x27;s fortifications repaired before returning east to Le District (樂鄉; east of present-day Songzi, Hubei). He remained humble after his victory in Xiling and still behaved in the same manner as he did before. His humility earned him the respect and favour of his men.

==Making peace with Yang Hu==
The &quot;Jin Yang Qiu&quot; () recorded that Lu Kang was on friendly terms with the Jin general Yang Hu even though they stood on opposing sides. Their friendship was likened to that of Zichan and Jizha during the Spring and Autumn period. Lu Kang once sent wine to Yang Hu, who drank it without showing any signs of suspicion. Later, when Lu Kang fell sick, Yang Hu sent medicine to him, which Lu Kang also took without suspecting anything. The people of that time remarked that the relationship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu was like that of Hua Yuan and Zifan during the Spring and Autumn period.

The &quot;Han Jin Chunqiu&quot; () further described this uncanny friendship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu. After returning to Jin territory, Yang Hu started promoting morality and civility, and many Wu citizens were impressed with him. Lu Kang told the Wu forces stationed at the Wu-Jin border: &quot;If they govern with virtue and we administer our state like tyrants, we will lose the war without even having to fight. I hope that you can guard the border well and not stir up problems over trivial matters.&quot; 

The Wu-Jin border experienced peace and stability as both sides actively practised &quot;détente&quot; and got along harmoniously with each other. If cattle from one side accidentally strayed across the border, the other side would allow the owners to cross the border and retrieve their cattle. During hunting expeditions at the border, if the citizens of either side were injured, the other would send them home safely. When Lu Kang fell sick, he asked for medicine from Yang Hu. Yang Hu obliged and said: &quot;This medicine is of fine quality. I prepared it myself. I haven&#x27;t tried it myself when I heard that you are ill so I sent it to you.&quot; Lu Kang&#x27;s subordinates cautioned him against taking Yang Hu&#x27;s medicine because they were worried that Yang Hu might harm him, but Lu Kang ignored them. When the Wu emperor Sun Hao received news of peaceful relations between Wu and Jin, he sent a messenger to reprimand Lu Kang, but Lu Kang replied: &quot;Ordinary peasants in the countryside have to keep their promises, much less me, a government official. If I do not live the virtues, I will appear as a stark contrast to Yang Hu. This does not result in any harm to Yang Hu.&quot; However, there were some people who disagreed with the behaviour of Lu Kang and Yang Hu, as they believed that the two men were not fulfilling their loyalties to their respective states.

===Xi Zuochi&#x27;s commentary===
Xi Zuochi, author of the &quot;Han Jin Chunqiu&quot;, commented on this issue as follows: 

==Later career==

===Speaking up against cruel and harsh laws===
After the Battle of Xiling, Lu Kang was promoted to Protector-General (). When he heard that Xue Ying, the Left Commandant of Wuchang, had been imprisoned, he wrote a memorial to Sun Hao: 

===Advising Sun Hao against waging war on Jin===
When battles were constantly waged between Wu and Jin and the people were suffering in those times of war, Lu Kang wrote another memorial to Sun Hao: 

===Final advice to Sun Hao===
In 273, Lu Kang was appointed as Grand Marshal () and Governor of Jing Province (). He fell sick in the summer of 274. During that time, he wrote a memorial to Sun Hao: 

==Descendants==
Lu Kang died in the autumn of 274 sometime between 20 August and 17 September. His son, Lu Yan (), inherited his titles. Lu Yan and his younger brothers – Lu Jing (), Lu Xuan (), Lu Ji () and Lu Yun () – shared command of their father&#x27;s troops and served as generals in Wu. Lu Kang also had another son, Lu Dan (), who was younger than Lu Yun.

Lu Yan was commissioned as a Major-General () and he served as the commander of Yidao (). In 280, the Jin dynasty launched a campaign against Eastern Wu. The Jin general Wang Jun led a naval fleet and sailed east towards Wu along the Yangtze River, capturing all the Wu territories along the way, just as Lu Kang had foreseen when he urged Sun Hao to strengthen the defences on Wu&#x27;s western border. Lu Yan was killed in a battle against Wang Jun&#x27;s forces on 22 March 280.

Lu Jing served as a general in Wu and was also killed in action during the Jin conquest of Wu. Lu Ji, Lu Yun and Lu Dan all came to serve the Jin dynasty after the fall of Wu. They were all executed along with their families during the War of the Eight Princes.

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Lu Kang&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on Lu Kang as follows: &quot;Lu Kang was loyal and faithful to his state, and was very capable and talented, much like his father. He had excellent moral conduct worthy of praise. He was also able to handle the overall situation well without neglecting details. He was thus able to accomplish such great tasks!&quot;

<text>Prince of Wales Island () is an Arctic island in Nunavut, Canada. One of the larger members of the Arctic Archipelago, it lies between Victoria Island and Somerset Island and is south of the Queen Elizabeth Islands.

For administrative purposes, it is divided between Qikiqtaaluk and Kitikmeot regions. There are no permanent settlements on the island.

==Geography==

It is a low tundra-covered island with an irregular coastline deeply indented by Ommanney Bay in the west and Browne Bay in the east. Ommanney Bay is named after Admiral Sir Erasmus Ommanney of the Royal Navy who explored the area as part of the search for the Franklin Expedition.

Its area has been estimated at . Prince of Wales Island is the world&#x27;s 40th largest island and the 10th largest in Canada. Its highest known point—with an elevation of —is an unnamed spot at in the island&#x27;s far northeastern end, overlooking the Baring Channel, which separates the island from nearby Russell Island.

==History==

Its European discovery came in 1851 by Francis Leopold McClintock&#x27;s sledge parties during the searches for John Franklin&#x27;s last expedition. McClintock, along with Sherard Osborn and William Browne, charted the northern half of the island. Its southern half was charted by Allen Young in 1859. It was named after Albert Edward, eldest son of Queen Victoria, then ten years old and Prince of Wales. He later became King Edward VII.

<text>George Hearst (September 3, 1820 – February 28, 1891) was an American businessman, politician, and patriarch of the Hearst business dynasty. After growing up on a small farm in Missouri, he founded many mining operations, and is known for developing and expanding the Homestake Mine in the late 1870s in the Black Hills of South Dakota. In 1879, he listed it on the New York Stock Exchange and went on to other pursuits. The mine&#x27;s gold production continued uninterrupted until 2001.

After settling in San Francisco in the early 1860s, Hearst became a politician, first representing San Francisco in the state legislature for one term. He also maintained mining interests through his company. Hearst was appointed as a United States senator in 1886 to fill a vacancy and was elected as a Democrat later that year on his own account. He served in the Senate from 1887 to his death in 1891. His only child from his late marriage (at age 42) was his son William Randolph Hearst, who became internationally known as a newspaperman and publisher, and was a primary inspiration for Orson Welles&#x27;s 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

==Early life==
Hearst was born near present-day Sullivan, Missouri, to William G. Hearst and Elizabeth Collins, who were of Scots-Irish ancestry. Hearst, one of three children – two boys and a girl – was raised in a log cabin on his family&#x27;s farm in rural Franklin County. His father operated three small farms, all of which were mortgaged. William Hearst sold his products in his own local general store.

George Hearst grew up before public education was widely available in Missouri, meaning his elementary education was inconsistent and fragmented. Becoming interested in mining, Hearst supplemented the gaps in his formal education by observing the local mines, reading information about minerals from books owned by his family doctor, Silas Reed, and mining in his free time.

==Mining career==
When his father died in 1846, Hearst at the age of 26 took over the support of his family: his mother, brother, and sister. In addition, he did some mining and ran a general store. He first heard of the discovery of gold in California in 1849. Before deciding to depart, he read further news on the subject to make sure it was true. In 1850, as a member of a party of 16, he left for California.

He and his party first tried placer mining in the vicinity of Sutter&#x27;s Mill on the American River. After spending a cold winter and making meager findings, they moved to Grass Valley in 1851 on the news of a new lode. Hearst switched to prospecting and dealing in quartz mines. After almost ten years, Hearst was making a decent living as a prospector, and otherwise engaged in running a general store, mining, raising livestock and farming in Nevada County.

In the summer of 1859, Hearst learned of promising silver assays of the &quot;blue stuff&quot; someone had picked up in Utah Territory (near what was to become the Comstock Lode), and had assayed in Nevada County, California. Hearst hurried to the Washoe district of western Utah Territory, where he arranged to buy a one-sixth interest in the Ophir Mine there, near present-day Virginia City. That winter, Hearst and his partners mined 38 tons of high-grade silver ore, packed it across the Sierra on muleback, had it smelted in San Francisco, and made $91,000 profit (or roughly $3,300,000 in 2023 dollars). People who saw the bars of Ophir silver in San Francisco rushed to Washoe.

Hearst knew Marcus Daly from their Comstock Lode work. In the summer of 1872, Daly suggested the potential of the Ontario silver mine in Park City, Utah. The Ontario carried Hearst through the Panic of 1873 and produced $17 million in 10 years. Hearst, Haggin and Tevis later financed Daly to operate his Anaconda mine in Butte, Montana, and acquired an interest in that mine as well.

==Investments==

With other mining investors, Hearst set up Hearst, Haggin, Tevis and Co., in which he was a partner. He had interests in the Comstock Lode and the Ophir mine in Nevada, the Ontario silver mine in Utah, the Pacific mine in Pinos Altos, New Mexico, the Homestake gold mine in South Dakota, and the Anaconda Copper Mine in Montana. The Homestake Mine was one of his biggest investments. Although the gold ore was lean, the massive deposit supported an active mine until 2001. Hearst laterinvested in the Cerro de Pasco Mine in Peru. His company grew to be the largest private mining firm in the United States. Hearst acquired the reputation of being the most expert prospector and judge of mining property on the Pacific coast. He contributed to the development of the modern processes of quartz and other kinds of mining.

George Hearst acquired the San Francisco &quot;Examiner&quot; newspaper as a sign of loyalty to his friends by accepting it as payment for a gambling debt owed to him. He primarily used the &quot;Examiner&quot; to promote the interests of the Democratic Party and to laud the party&#x27;s initiatives, especially when they were under public attack. His son William Randolph Hearst insisted on taking control of this holding of his father. The younger Hearst made the &quot;Examiner&quot; the foundation of what became his Hearst publishing empire.

==Personal and political life==

While building his mining career, George Hearst had supported his family in Missouri. In 1860, he returned to the state to care for his ailing mother and take care of some legal disputes. During this time, he became reacquainted with Phoebe Apperson, a neighbor of 18. The 42-year-old Hearst married her two years later, on June 15, 1862.

In the same year, Hearst and his new bride moved to San Francisco. Phoebe gave birth to their only child, William Randolph Hearst, on April 29, 1863.

Hearst was elected to the California State Assembly in 1864, serving one term from 1865 until 1866. He was one of 12 members representing San Francisco. His knowledge of mines and the mining industry proved valuable, and he was selected for a special Committee on Mines and Mining Interests. During this time (1865) he acquired Rancho Piedra Blanca at San Simeon, California. He later bought parts of adjoining ranchos. This land was later developed by his son as the Hearst Castle. The Hearsts also maintained a townhome in San Francisco at the corner of Chestnut and Leavenworth.

Hearst owned a thoroughbred horse racing stable. One of his better-known horses was Tournament which won the Jerome Handicap. Following 
Hearst&#x27;s death, Tournament was bought by Foxhall P. Keene, when the Hearst stable was auctioned at a dispersal sale on May 14, 1891.

Hearst ran unsuccessfully in 1882 as the Democratic candidate for Governor of California. Until this point, Hearst had a political relationship with Central Pacific Railroad. However, when the railroad&#x27;s leadership backed the other Democratic nominee in the primary, Hearst joined Christopher Augustine Buckley and Stephen M. White in developing the Anti-Monopoly Coalition.

==Senatorial career==
Hearst was a candidate for U.S. Senate in 1885, but lost to former Governor Leland Stanford. The next year, Hearst was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John F. Miller, and served from March 23, 1886, to August 4, 1886, when Abram Williams was elected. In 1887, he was elected in the regular election that year by the state legislature to the Senate as a Democrat, serving from March 4, 1887, until his death in 1891. As a Senator, Hearst focused on reducing Central Pacific&#x27;s power in American commerce.

==Death and legacy==

Hearst died at the age of 70 in Washington, D.C., on February 28, 1891. The California Legislature and state courts adjourned so officials could attend his funeral.
When Phoebe Apperson Hearst inherited her husband&#x27;s wealth, she donated a small amount to fund new libraries in the two communities where Hearst had an outsized mining influence: Lead, South Dakota, and Anaconda, Montana. She went on to promote a significant number of educational initiatives in California and was the first woman to serve on the California Board of Regents. 
Hearst is buried in Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma, California. His widow and son were later buried there as well.

The Hearst Memorial Mining Building on the Berkeley campus is dedicated to George Hearst.

In 1996, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==In popular culture==
*In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s short story &quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot;, Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s client is Neil Gibson, described as &quot;The Gold King&quot; and as a senator from &quot;some western state,&quot; indicating that Conan Doyle was modeling the character on Hearst. Ironically, in its first American publication, the story appeared in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International Magazine&quot;, a publication of Hearst&#x27;s son, William Randolph Hearst.
*Moroni Olsen portrayed Hearst in the 1938 film &quot;Gold Is Where You Find It&quot;.
*In the 1941 film Citizen Kane, Harry Shannon played a fictionalized George Hearst, Jim Kane, the father of Charles Foster Kane, the lead character based upon William Randolph Hearst. 
*The actor Barry Kelley portrayed Hearst in the 1964 episode &quot;The Paper Dynasty&quot; of the syndicated western television series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. James Hampton played William Randolph Hearst and James Lanphier (1920–1969) played Ambrose Bierce.
*Gerald McRaney portrayed a fictionalized version of Hearst, depicted as a villain on the HBO television series &quot;Deadwood&quot;, set in South Dakota. McRaney reprised his role in 2019&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. This time, Hearst returns to Deadwood 10 years after the events of the third season and is now a senator but still the main villain. The crimes committed by the fictional character take significant artistic license with those attributed to the real personage of Hearst at the Homestake Mine.

<text>Robert Boyce Brandom (; born March 13, 1950) is an American philosopher who teaches at the University of Pittsburgh. He works primarily in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind and philosophical logic, and his academic output manifests both systematic and historical interests in these topics. His work has presented &quot;arguably the first fully systematic and technically rigorous attempt to explain the meaning of linguistic items in terms of their socially norm-governed use (&quot;meaning as use&quot;, to cite the Wittgensteinian slogan), thereby also giving a non-representationalist account of the intentionality of thought and the rationality of action as well.&quot;

Brandom is broadly considered to be part of the American pragmatist tradition in philosophy. In 2003 he won the Mellon Distinguished Achievement Award.

==Education==
Brandom earned his BA in 1972 from Yale University and his PhD in 1977 from Princeton University, under Richard Rorty and David Kellogg Lewis. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;Practice and Object&quot;.

==Philosophy==
Brandom&#x27;s work is heavily influenced by that of Wilfrid Sellars, Richard Rorty, Michael Dummett and his Pittsburgh colleague John McDowell. He also draws heavily on the works of Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Gottlob Frege, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

He is best known for his investigations of linguistic meanings, or semantics. He advocates the view that the meaning of an expression is fixed by how it is used in inferences (see inferential role semantics). This project is developed at length in his influential 1994 book &quot;Making It Explicit&quot;, and more briefly in &quot;Articulating Reasons: An Introduction to Inferentialism&quot; (2000); a chapter of that latter work, &quot;Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism&quot;, outlines the main themes of representationalism (the tradition of basing semantics on the concept of representation) vs. inferentialism (the conviction for an expression to be meaningful is to be governed by a certain kind of inferential rules) and inferentialism&#x27;s relationship to logical expressivism (the conviction that &quot;logic is expressive in the sense that it makes explicit or codifies certain aspects of the inferential structure of our discursive practice&quot;).

Brandom has also published a collection of essays on the history of philosophy, &quot;Tales of the Mighty Dead&quot; (2002), a critical and historical sketch of what he calls the &quot;philosophy of intentionality&quot;. He is the editor of a collection of papers about Richard Rorty&#x27;s philosophy, &quot;Rorty and His Critics&quot; (2000). Brandom delivered the 2006 John Locke lectures at Oxford University, which Oxford University Press published under the title &quot;Between Saying and Doing: Towards an Analytic Pragmatism&quot; (2008). In 2019 he published &quot;A Spirit of Trust&quot;, a book about Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;.
