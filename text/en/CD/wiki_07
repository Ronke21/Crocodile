<text>Nineteen Eighty-Four is a British television adaptation of the 1949 novel of the same name by George Orwell, originally broadcast on BBC Television in December 1954. The production proved to be hugely controversial, with questions asked in Parliament and many viewer complaints over its supposed subversive nature and horrific content. It starred Peter Cushing (as Winston Smith), Yvonne Mitchell, Donald Pleasence and André Morell.

In a 2000 poll of industry experts conducted by the British Film Institute to determine the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; was ranked in seventy-third position.

==Background==
Orwell&#x27;s novel was adapted for television by Nigel Kneale, one of the most prolific television scriptwriters of the time. The previous year he had created the character of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the science-fiction serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. The adaptation was produced and directed by the equally respected Rudolph Cartier, perhaps the BBC&#x27;s best producer-director of the 1950s who was always adventurous artistically and technically. Cartier, a veteran of the UFA film studios in 1930s Germany who had fled the Nazi regime for Britain in 1936, had worked with Kneale the previous year on &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; and was a veteran of many television drama productions.

It was Cartier&#x27;s work on Quatermass that had prompted the BBC&#x27;s Head of Drama, Michael Barry, to ask him to work on an adaptation of the novel, having shown his abilities with literary sources in a version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, again with Kneale handling the scripting. The BBC had purchased the rights to a television version of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; soon after its publication in 1949, with Kenneth Tynan having apparently originally been keen on adapting the work. The first version of the script, produced in late 1953, was written by Hugh Faulks, in consultation with Orwell&#x27;s widow Sonia Brownell, but when Cartier joined in January 1954 he demanded that Kneale be allowed to handle the adaptation. This and other complexities of production meant that the April airdate – which would have been about 30 years before the novel was set – had to be postponed.

==Cast and crew==
The role of Winston Smith was taken by Peter Cushing, one of his first major roles. Cartier cast him after having been impressed with his performance in a BBC production of &quot;Anastasia&quot; the previous year. Cushing went on to become a film star, as would his co-star Donald Pleasence, who played Syme. Pleasence was the only member of the cast present in the 1956 feature film adaptation of the story, playing an amalgamation of Syme and Parsons with the latter&#x27;s name.

Other cast members included Yvonne Mitchell, who had starred in the Kneale/Cartier &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, as Julia, and André Morell as O&#x27;Brien. Wilfrid Brambell, later known for his roles in &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and as Paul McCartney&#x27;s grandfather in &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, appeared in two roles, as the old man Winston speaks with in the pub and as a prisoner later on when Winston is incarcerated. Nigel Kneale, who had briefly acted in the 1940s before turning to scriptwriting, had a small voice-over role as an announcer. The face of Big Brother was Roy Oxley, a member of the BBC design department whose inclusion was something of an in-joke on the part of the production team.

The composer of the incidental music for the programme was John Hotchkis, who insisted on a larger than usual orchestra to perform the piece.

==Production==

Until the early 1960s, the vast majority of the BBC&#x27;s television was performed live. Nonetheless, there was a certain degree of pre-shooting in the form of inserts on film, which could be played into the studio and broadcast as part of the play to cover changes of scene or show location material which would have been impossible to mount live in the studio. Initial filming for &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; took place on 10 November 1954 in Studio B of Alexandra Palace (even by then all but abandoned as a venue for shooting drama, although it housed the news and later the Open University for the next thirty years), with footage of the Two Minutes&#x27; Hate and some of the canteen scenes being filmed there.

Further location shooting took place on 18 November which were exterior scenes featuring Smith&#x27;s travels in the proletarian sector. According to Peter Cushing, speaking on &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot; in 1965, these scenes were filmed on the demolition site that became BBC Television Centre. Following the filming, rehearsals for the cast began at Mary Ward Settlement, Tavistock Place from 22 November (moving to 60 Paddington Street from 29 November). During these rehearsals, the cast memorised their lines and cues as important in a live television production as in a stage play.

The cast and crew moved to Studio D at the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove Studios on Saturday 11 December 1954 for a full camera rehearsal and run-through. Rehearsals continued the following day until shortly before transmission, which began at 20:37 Sunday 12 December and continued for the best part of two hours.

Kneale&#x27;s script was a largely faithful adaptation of the novel as far as was practical. The writer made some small additions, the most notable being the creation of a sequence in which O&#x27;Brien observes Julia at work in PornoSec and reads a small segment from one of the erotic novels being written by the machines.

==Reaction==
The play provoked something of an upset. There were complaints about the &quot;horrific&quot; content (particularly the Room 101 scene where Smith is threatened with torture by rats) and the &quot;subversive&quot; nature of the play. Most were worried by the depiction of a totalitarian regime controlling the population&#x27;s freedom of thought. There was also a report in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper of 42-year-old Beryl Merfin of Herne Bay collapsing and dying as she watched the production, under the headline &quot;Wife dies as she watches&quot;, allegedly from the shock of what she had seen. An anonymous reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Inevitably, in a dramatic presentation of the book much of the irony is lost; and the weakness of this television version was that concentrating on the action it reduced the ideological explanation so drastically that it robbed the story of at least half its power&quot;. It was a &quot;pictorial simplification&quot; of &quot;Orwell&#x27;s vision&quot;. The writer, however, admired the performances of Cushing, Mitchell and Morell. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; reviewer defended the BBC for screening the drama, while &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, a communist newspaper, described it as a &quot;Tory guttersnipe’s view of socialism&quot;.

Political reaction was divided, with several early day motions and amendments tabled in Parliament. One motion, signed by five MPs, deplored &quot;the tendency, evident in recent British Broadcasting Corporation television programmes, notably on Sunday evenings, to pander to sexual and sadistic tastes&quot;. An amendment was tabled which sought to make the motion now deplore &quot;the tendency of honourable members to attack the courage and enterprise of the British Broadcasting Corporation in presenting plays and programmes capable of appreciation by adult minds, on Sunday evenings and other occasions.&quot; It was signed by five MPs. Another amendment added &quot;but is thankful that the freedom of the individual still permits viewers to switch off and, due to the foresight of her Majesty&#x27;s Government, will soon permit a switch-over to be made to more appropriate programmes.&quot; A second motion signed by six MPs, applauded &quot;the sincere attempts of the BBC. to bring home to the British people the logical and soul-destroying consequences of the surrender of their freedom&quot; and calling attention to the fact that &quot;many of the inhuman practices depicted in the play &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; are already in common use under totalitarian régimes.&quot;, Even the Queen and Prince Philip made it known that they had watched and enjoyed the play.

Amidst objections the BBC went ahead with a complete live restaging on Thursday 16 December. This was introduced live on camera by Head of Drama Michael Barry, who had already appeared on the topical news programme &quot;Panorama&quot; on 15 December to defend the production. The seven million viewers who watched the Thursday performance was the largest television audience in the UK since the Coronation the previous year.

At the time, television images could only be preserved on film by using a special recording apparatus (known as &quot;telerecording&quot; in the UK and &quot;kinescoping&quot; in the USA) but was used sparingly in Britain for preservation and not for pre-recording. It is thus the second performance, one of the earliest surviving British television dramas, that is preserved in the archives. Cushing felt, however, that this second performance &#x27;lacked the spontaneity and inspiration of the first, suffering from the furore provoked during those three intervening days.&#x27;

==&quot;The Goon Show&quot; parody==

Spike Milligan wrote a parody of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; for &quot;The Goon Show&quot; entitled &quot;1985&quot;, broadcast on 4 January 1955. The cast of characters included Worker 846 Winston Seagoon (Harry Secombe), Miss Sfnut (Peter Sellers) and Worker 213 Eccles (Milligan); Big Brother was replaced by the Big Brother Corporation (i.e. the BBC) and Goldstein&#x27;s revolution by Horace Minikstein&#x27;s Independent Television Army (i.e. the Independent Television Authority). Jokes included such stabs at the BBC as:

Announcer (Sellers): &quot;Attention BBC workers! Lunch is now being served in the BBC Canteen. Doctors are standing by.&quot;

Seagoon is tortured in Room 101 by being forced to listen to clips from &quot;Ray&#x27;s a Laugh&quot;, &quot;Life with the Lyons&quot; and the singing of Harry Secombe. Unlike the original script, Seagoon is freed from Room 101 and the ITA overthrows the BBC after a three-day phone call and a £10 bribe. However, when Seagoon hears the ITA&#x27;s output, he wants the BBC brought back.

The programme was such a success that the script was performed again on 8 February 1955. This was not a repeat – it was a new broadcast of the same script with minor changes. One change was the recorded addition of John Snagge as the BBC announcer previously portrayed by Sellers.

The first version exists in pristine form in the BBC archives, the second performance only as a lower-quality off-air recording, which excludes the first five minutes of the programme and both musical interludes, preserving about 18 minutes of material.

==Legacy==
It was twenty-three years before the 35mm telerecording of the 16 December performance received a repeat broadcast, in 1977. Another proposed repeat as part of the BBC&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary of television celebrations in 1986 was overruled by the producers of the 1984 John Hurt/Richard Burton feature film, who felt that earlier versions would affect income for their film. The BBC was permitted to show the play again in 1994 on BBC Two, as a tribute to the recently deceased Cartier and again in June 2003 on digital station BBC Four as part of the George Orwell centenary celebrations.

Kneale&#x27;s adaptation was produced again by the BBC, with some modifications in 1965. Starring David Buck, Joseph O&#x27;Conor, Jane Merrow and Cyril Shaps, it was broadcast in BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Theatre 625&quot; anthology series as part of a season of Orwell adaptations sub-titled &quot;The World of George Orwell&quot;, on 28 November 1965. Long believed lost, on 12 September 2010 it was announced that a copy had been located at the American Library of Congress, although an approximately seven-minute segment in the middle was unrecoverable from the NTSC video tape recording. It was recovered amongst a hoard of over 80 lost British television episodes dating from 1957 to 1970. In 1965, a radio adaptation was broadcast on the BBC Home Service with Patrick Troughton, soon to become the Second Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. This radio version was properly archived and has survived.

Scenes from &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, along with the 1954 adaptation of &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, were featured in &quot;The Two Winstons&quot;, the final episode of Simon Schama&#x27;s program &quot;A History of Britain&quot;.

<text>Black soup was a dish in the cuisine of ancient Sparta, made with boiled pork meat and blood, using only salt and vinegar to flavour. The soup was well known during antiquity in the Greek world, but no original recipe of the dish survives today. The earliest recorded mention of the soup can be dated to the fifth century BC, in a comedy titled &quot;The Miners&quot;, written by Pherecrates. The ancient sources provide contradictory accounts on whether the soup was a luxurious meal served only at banquets or a dish that could be afforded by all Spartiates. Throughout history, black soup has been praised by and associated with figures such as Benjamin Rush and Adolf Hitler, although Hitler was (debatably) vegetarian.

== Etymology ==
The ancient Greek author, Plutarch, who wrote in the first and second century AD, mentioned a Spartan dish in his &quot;Life of Lycurgus&quot; named . Today, the phrase has been translated to &quot;black soup&quot; or &quot;black broth&quot;. In other ancient sources, this same dish was also known as , which means &quot;blood soup&quot;, and , , which can be translated as &quot;dip sauce&quot;. Other times, this dish was simply referred to as .

In Ancient Greek, the term means black, while could refer to any soup cooked using animal products. The 1st-century AD medical writer Dioscurides recorded that there were many variations of . For example, it could be cooked using frog, crayfish, rooster, beef, deer fat, and fish. The 5th–4th-century BC philosopher Plato also used the term when referring to a meat dish. Aristotle, writing around the 4th century BC, stated in his that could be made using horse, pork, mutton, or goat. Contrarily, the ancient Greeks had another designated name for soups made primarily with vegetables, which was .

== Ancient sources ==
The majority of the ancient sources that describe black soup were written by non-Spartan authors. These authors include Pherecrates of the fifth century BC, Alexis and Matro of Pitane of the fourth and third century BC, Nicostratus of the fourth century BC, and Euphron of the third century BC. For example, in Pherecrates&#x27; comedy, &quot;The Miners&quot;, a woman returning from the underworld states that she saw black broth free-flowing through the streets. Antiphanes, a contemporary comedian of Alexis, had also noted that black soup was a staple of the Spartan culture in a play titled &quot;The Archon&quot;. A fragmentary anecdote indicates that Nicostratus once ridiculed a cook for not knowing how to prepare the Spartan black soup, along with other dishes such as (: stuffed leaves), (: a Lydian dish), and (: a type of dessert).

Other references to black soup are indirect. For example, in Aristophane&#x27;s &quot;Knights,&quot; one of the lines in this comedy is &quot;He has had tasty stews exported from Athens for the Spartan fleet.&quot; Although the reference is not explicit, the fifth century BC poet was suggesting that the Spartan version of stew was not as good as the stew cooked by the Athenians. Classics scholar David Harvey stated that the playwright was likely making fun of Spartan black broth in this passage.

&quot;Suda Lexicon&quot;, a Byzantine Greek historical encyclopedia compiled much later during the tenth century AD, states that was a stock cooked using pig, cow, goat, sheep, or bear meat. Julius Pollux&#x27;s lexicographic work, , notes that the black broth was a Spartan dish cooked with meat and blood.

== Origin ==
According to what Euphron (a third-century BC comedy poet) had written in one of his fragmentary comedies, titled &quot;The Brothers&quot;, a cook mentions that a man named Lamprias was responsible for inventing the Spartan black soup. However, this claim would be impossible to verify today.

== Ingredients ==
No recording of black soup&#x27;s exact recipe exists today. Ancient literary sources, including historical, medical, and lexicographic, contain descriptions of black soup and its ingredients. Through interpreting these sources, it can be concluded that the Spartans cooked this dish using pig&#x27;s blood and meat, with salt and vinegar as the only condiments. According to Plutarch&#x27;s descriptions, the solid meat chunks in the soup were to be taken out and served separately to the younger attendees during banquets.

Plutarch is one of the ancient authors that alluded to this dish in his writings, such as in the &quot;Life of Lycurgus&quot;. In a passage explaining the Spartan society&#x27;s dining and banqueting culture, Plutarch states that Sparta&#x27;s most famous dish was black soup. The text also suggests that the elders would save the meat for the younger attendees, and they themselves would drink only the liquid. From Plutarch&#x27;s account, can be interpreted as a soup dish made primarily using meat.

In another work of Plutarch, , the author states that the Lacedaemonian (Spartan) cooks could only use vinegar and salt to prepare their food and were supposed to utilize all parts of a sacrificed animal. The historian Maciej Kokoszko theorized that Spartans did not use vinegar to marinate the meat. Instead, the vinegar was mixed with the animal&#x27;s blood during cooking. As the vinegar was added to the blood, it would slow down the clotting process and prevent the blood from spoiling.

Dicaearchus, writing in the fourth and third centuries BC, stated that one of the dishes once served in Classical Sparta was a made using boiled pork. The pork was paid for using the money collected from each member eating at the Spartan mess () to purchase the pigs at the market. The mess () was a membership-based institution that Spartan adults would join upon completing their military training and was essentially a dinner club where men would banquet together. According to Plutarch, each Spartan mess member&#x27;s monthly contribution included different kinds of produce and cash. This money was specified as &quot;ten Aiginetan &quot;obols&quot;.&quot; The sum collected would allow them to purchase up to a dozen piglets per month as the raw ingredients for cooking black soup. The German scholar, Link, has also theorized that black soup was the contribution made by the poor Spartans to the , the extra voluntary donations of pre-prepared dishes and wheat bread.

The British Hellenistic scholar W. Geoffrey Arnott has also raised the speculation that Spartan black soup was meatless, made using a black variety of chickpea or Bengal gram, but this theory has been refuted by classicists such as Maciej Kokoszko.

== Occasions of consumption ==
How often the Spartans consumed black soup and whether it could be considered a delicacy are both debated questions in ancient sources. Seventh-century BC Spartan poet Alcman inferred that the food ordinary people in Sparta consumed was a pea soup, not the meat-based black soup. On this basis, the historian, Hans Van Wees, suggested that black soup could not be a dish that the average Spartans regularly consumed since it would entail the slaughtering of an animal. For example, it was during royal sacrifices that pigs were part of the offerings. There is also other contrary evidence suggesting that black soup was, in fact, a modest dish. In one of Matro of Pitane&#x27;s poems, black soup appeared in the text alongside a dish named (). were boiled animal off-cuts, such as the skin, ears, and snouts, suggesting black soup belonged in the category of inexpensive dishes.

=== Banquets ===
According to Dicaearchus&#x27; , in Classical Sparta, the dishes served for communal banquets were the and the following sides dishes: black soup, modest servings of boiled pork meat, olives, cheese, figs, and additional courses such as fish, hare, and pigeon. Spartans also consumed seasonal produce, such as birds and game. Modern scholars have interpreted as a type of barley bread, gruel, or flat griddle cake. The writings of Pherecrates and Alexis confirm that Spartans likely served black soup along with . was a common food among the ancient Greeks, and the poor would consume it when they could not afford anything else. Because of its flat shape, could also be used as plates when no utensils were available. Based on Alexis and Plutarch&#x27;s account, Maciej Kokoszko has inferred that both the black soup and were unsophisticated foods and were not delicacies.

During the Spartan banquets, the meal would end with dessert (). Plutarch asserts that Spartans also served wine at these banquets. One of the fragmentary poetries written by the poet, Alcman depicts that Sparta once had a luxurious feasting tradition. Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Cleomenes&quot; provides a contradictory account, stating that the banqueting culture in Sparta was &quot;unsophisticated&quot; and Spartans served neither side dishes (: ) nor baked goods. Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; contains a story of the Spartan general, Pausanias, ordering his servants to prepare him a Laconian (Spartan) dinner when visiting the lavish military camp of the Persian leader, Mardonius. This anecdote also suggests that the typical meals in Sparta were much less extravagant.

=== Religious celebrations ===
A scholia reference further implies that was made using the leftovers from cooking the sacrificial meat during the Panathenaea celebrations. While the soup was served to the poor, the wealthier individuals could receive servings of the meat. Several ancient fragmentary poetries, including Philyllius&#x27; &quot;The Island Towns&quot; and Epilycus&#x27; &quot;Coraliscus&quot;, have noted that during the Cleaver festival (), black soup was served at the temple of Apollo in Amyclae, a city located in Laconia that was at the time under Spartan control. The same sources also recorded that aside from the soup, barley cakes and wheat loaves would be served as well.

=== Military campaigns ===
There is no recording of the Spartans consuming black soup on military campaigns. The fifth century BC historian, Thucydides&#x27; account of the Spartan attack on Pylos in 425 BC includes a description of the Spartan army ration: ground corn, cheese, wine, and &quot;any other food useful in a siege,&quot; which was not further specified in the passage. While Spartiate soldiers were typically well-nourished, there is no ancient literary evidence that suggests that black soup was part of their regular diet on military campaigns.

=== Domestic settings ===
Notably, the ancient sources do not provide accounts of whether black soup was cooked or served in domestic settings. The attendance of Spartan banquets was exclusive to male adult citizens. Therefore, there is no ancient recording of whether younger children or women in Sparta also had the chance of tasting and consuming the soup. Sparta&#x27;s citizen class, known as Spartiates, was also restricted to approximately 6 percent of Spartan society, limiting the dish&#x27;s potential range further.

== Notoriety ==
The Spartan black soup was known to the other Greeks during antiquity.

Plutarch mentions that one of the kings of Pontus had once purchased a Lacedaemonian cookbook to recreate this dish. After the king has stated his dislike of the dish, the cook responded that one could only appreciate this broth after having swum in the Eurotas River, a famous landmark located within Sparta, suggesting that one could not develop a palate for this particular dish unless raised in Spartan society. Plutarch probably recorded this account, drawing from the earlier writings of Xenophon. Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Tusculan Disputations&quot; retells the same story, although the figure of the king of Pontus has changed to the Dionysios of Syracuse.

Plutarch also tells of an account of the Athenian general, Alcibiades attempting to fit into Spartan society by eating black soup when he fled to Sparta from Athens due to political pressure.

Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pelopidas&quot; has recorded that an inhabitant of Sybaris had once claimed, &quot;it was no great thing for the Spartans to seek death in the wars in order to escape so many hardships and such a wretched life as theirs.&quot; Historians such as Maciej Kokoszko and Joan P. Alcock have interpreted this claim as supporting evidence of ancient Sparta&#x27;s unbearable customs and food.

The broth&#x27;s unique taste can be cross-referenced by a narration of how willing the Spartans were to share this dish with outsiders, as detailed in another work of Plutarch, &quot;the Life of Cleomenes&quot;. Cleomenes, a Spartan king who lived in the third century BC, once had a disagreement with his friend over serving the black soup to foreign visitors, who he argued could not appreciate the flavour. Maciej Kokoszko theorized that the Spartans were reluctant to introduce this dish to those who were not part of their community likely because the soup had a unique taste.

== Modern associations ==
As Spartan history gained popularity in the United States in the late 18th-century, Benjamin Rush, one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, is recorded to have praised the Spartan black broth.

Adolf Hitler, a vegetarian in his later years, was an admirer of aspects of the ancient Spartan society, and noted their fondness for black soup. He compared the broth to &quot;Schwarzsauer&quot;, a regional dish of the German state Schleswig-Holstein. However, it was the example of Roman soldiers eating fruits and cereals and the importance of raw vegetables that he promoted. Shortly before World War II, a paper titled &quot;Spartan &quot;Pimpfe&quot;&quot; circulated in Germany. The essay claimed that Spartan youths would have black soup as lunch before attending sporting competitions.

W. Geoffrey Arnott, a British Hellenistic scholar, suggested that &quot;the Gypsies still served this dish at fairs in northern England up to the 1940s.&quot;

<text>Witley is a village in the civil parish of Witley and Milford in the Waverley district in Surrey, England centred south west of the town of Godalming and southwest of Guildford. The land is a mixture of rural (ranging from woodland protected by the Surrey Hills AONB including a small part of the forested Greensand Ridge to cultivated fields) contrasting with elements more closely resembling a suburban satellite village. In 2011 the parish had a population of 8130.

As a civil parish it is unusual in that it includes the small town of Milford in the north. Occupying its hills in the south-west are Sandhills and Brook. On 1 April 2023 the parish was renamed from &quot;Witley&quot; to &quot;Witley and Milford&quot;, at the same time part was moved to Haslemere and Peper Harow.

Witley Common is a wide expanse of land, owned by the National Trust, crossed by the A3 road. The village is served by two stations on the Portsmouth Direct Line: Witley station, to the south in nearby Wormley, and, to the north, Milford station, which is more or less equidistant between Milford and Witley. Its church dates to the pre-Norman Conquest period of the Kingdom of England. The village has the private sector, but charitable co-educational boarding and day school King Edward&#x27;s School founded in Westminster in 1553 by King Edward VI and bishop Nicholas Ridley – supported by the City of London Corporation.

==History==

Much of the history is described by way of its historical sites below.

Witley appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Witlei&quot;. Its domesday assets were held by Gislebert (Gilbert), son of Richere de L&#x27;Aigle. It rendered: 12 hides; 1 church, 15 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 30 hogs, in the Godalming Hundred and rendered £16.

In 1848, Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;topographical dictionary of England&quot; describes Witley as 
In 1911 historian and factfinder for the Victoria County Histories that turned to Surrey that year, H.E. Malden, wrote copiously about the advowson, of minimal notability given general forfeiture in favour of each diocese appointing its own clergy – he wrote 1,857 words about the church history with a layout plan. As to manors which owned virtually all of the land in the medieval period, seven existed – of which three were senior as had nobility living in, or owning, them; Malden wrote 3,788 words, mostly of their ownership and centrepiece of each, the manor house. These senior manors are summarised below whereas the other four were &quot;Wytley Chesberies or Wytley Cheasburies Manor&quot;, &quot;Mousehill Manor&quot;, &quot;Rake Manor&quot; and &quot;Roke or Roakeland Manor&quot;.

===Witley Manor===
Earl Godwin, father of Harold Godwinson, was the lord of the manor before the Norman Conquest. According to Domesday Book, Witley was held by Gislebert (Gilbert), son of Richere de L&#x27;Aigle, in 1086. In the 12th century, Richer de Aquila forfeited his land to the crown for complicity in the rebellion of William Clito against the crown. Malden reveals the legal term then used, one still used today, escheat.

William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, Gilbert&#x27;s nephew by marriage, was granted it, who died in 1240. However, this was to no effect, as he gave it back. It reverted to the King, who then granted it to Peter de Rivaulx, who similarly suffered a &quot;deprivation&quot; in 1234. In 1246 Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke was awarded it, and surrendered it; then still termed part of the &quot;honour of Aquila&quot;, Peter of Savoy and later Earl of Richmond, uncle of Queen Eleanor, received this land; homage stopped, rents rose and, on the baronial victory in 1264, Peter of Savoy having fled from the country, this manor was briefly in the custody of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford and Earl of Gloucester. After his success at Evesham in 1264, Eleanor was seized, who granted the tenants a release from the oppressive exactions of her predecessor on condition that they should cause a yearly service to be held in Witley Church for the souls of her husband and of Peter of Savoy.

Queen Isabella, Queen to Edward II of England, surrendered it with her other lands in 1330 and it formed part of next Queen Philippa of Hainault&#x27;s dower in January 1330–31. After an intriguing further incidence of exhortation, many years later Sir Bryan Stapilton held it for life, followed by James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele, soldier and politician. He was put to death during the Kentish rebellion of Jack Cade, and the Manor passed to the King&#x27;s brother Jasper Tudor (created Duke of Bedford, Earl of Pembroke); when the Wars of the Roses raged the Earl of Kent was awarded it, followed by the soon-to-be executed George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. Then we see still more royal holding, with stewards Sir George Brown, Sir William Fitz William, Sir Anthony Browne and Henry VIII&#x27;s server of the chamber, Thomas Jones. In 1551 new Baron Saye and Sele (dubious, per Malden) Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln sold the estate to Richard Sackville (escheator) for Surrey, who made William More of Loseley steward. Elizabeth I had it within her powers by the time of her accession to just grant the manor, possibly due to the internal wars of religion and Sir Francis Wolley (see his daughter Hannah Woolley), to Sir George More in 1605. He later sold the park to Sir Edward More, and the title of the manor to Henry Bell of Rake manor. After this time the manor was never again held by nobility.

===Lea Park known as Witley Park===

The early history of Lea Park (renamed Witley Park during the 20th century) is entwined with that of Witley Manor. Specific frequent appointments to the office of keeper occur in the Patent Rolls, sometimes in conjunction with that of Ashurst Park: in 1514, for example, to Thomas Jones and also to his son. In 1656 Edward More, grandson of Sir Edward, sold it to Thomas Russell; it was probably already broken up into farms, and James Cecil, 4th Earl of Salisbury had half of it via marriage. By heirs expiring of the other moiety, James Cecil, 6th Earl of Salisbury received the remaining (as some is thought to have been sold off) whole of Lea park in 1730. His son sold it to a William Smith of Godalming in 1791. Allen Chandler sold it to the Earl of Derby in 1876. It was subsequently sold to Whitaker Wright (see below) for £250,000.

===Oxenford Grange===

This was within Peper Harow Park, but in the parish of Witley, and was early held by Richer de Aquila and subsequently his grandson heir Gilbert. It was included in the Dissolution of the Monasteries grant of Waverley Abbey to Sir William Fitz William, with which it descended to Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu who died seised of a &quot;messuage called Oxenford&quot;, 9 October 1592. Similarly to the above, Sir George More of Loseley in 1609, Oxenford passed to Bartholomew Hone and heir John Chesterton of St. Giles in the Fields in 1619. In 1667 Antony Covert and his son conveyed their third to John Platt of Westbrook and his heirs; his son Sir John Platt and a John Smith sold it to prominent parliamentarian Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles; the other third was sold by the Fox family to George Brodrick, 4th Viscount Midleton c. 1822; his son employed Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin to build an imitation 13th century farm here.

==Landmarks==

* The oldest parts of All Saints&#x27; Church date from the early-mid eleventh century, shortly before the Norman Conquest. The south wall, west wall and part of the north wall are from this period and are constructed from sandstone rubble, with some of the masonry laid in a herringbone pattern. The church building was transformed by the Normans and enlarged into a cruciform shape towards the end of the 12th century, when the tower was also erected. The church contains an inscribed stone, set in the chancel wall, bearing the name of the Duke of Clarence (see below), which is believed to be part of an unfinished memorial to one of his bailiffs. The church is a Grade I listed building. The graveyard has 13 war graves administered by the CWGC.

* Witley Park, the home of Whitaker Wright, was built in the 1890s at a cost of £1.85 million. It was one of the most lavish private residences in the world. The grounds included a series of three interconnecting lakes and an underwater billiard room. The main building burnt to the ground in 1953. Today the grounds and remaining buildings are private family homes.
* Old Cottage and Step Cottage, dating from the 15th and 16th centuries, are close to the church.
* White Hart, the village public house, is mostly Elizabethan and is said to stand on the site of a Saxon inn.

===Semaphore/Telegraph Station===
On Bannicle or Bannack Hill stood an Admiralty telegraph station which was built in 1822 as part of a semaphore line between the Admiralty in London and Portsmouth. It was about 30 yards east of Hill House, but no trace remains. William Cobbett in &quot;Rural Rides&quot;, in which he pursues his hallmark restraint of empire and government views, referred to the station when travelling through the hills of Hambledon. &quot;On one of these hills is one of those precious jobs, called &quot;semaphores&quot;. For what reason this pretty name is given to a sort of Telegraph house, stuck up at public expense upon a high hill; for what reason this outlandish name is given to the thing, I must leave the reader to guess; but as to the thing itself; I know that it means this; a pretence for giving a good sum of public away every year ...&quot;
==Geography==
Witley is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Waverley in Surrey south west of Godalming and southwest of the county town, Guildford. The village lies just east of the A3 from London to Portsmouth between Guildford and Petersfield; London is northeast as the crow flies.

Witley Civil Parish contains the large village of Milford (arguably a small town to the north, which also has the next railway station on the line to London, however, which is closer to Wheelerstreet and Witley historic village along than to Milford) and the localities set out in this article, all of which, apart from Culmer, Wormley, Sandhills and Brook are , linked by unbroken paved roads and development forming a wide arc surrounded by Witley Common or by the Witley Stream, Enton lakes and ponds. The census area Waverley Middle Layer Super Output Area 12 (which excludes Milford but adds most of Hambledon, Thursley and Hascombe) gives a population of 6,619 in 2001, whereas the civil parish had a population of 7,703. If the population of Thursley CP (654) is subtracted and those of Hascombe (241) and Hambledon CPs (765) from Area 12, Witley&#x27;s habitually resident population, excluding the major settlement of Milford stood at 4,959.

Witley civil parish council has a website with sections for Witley and Milford. It consists of 16 councillors; unpaid as with all civil parishes, and the rest of Waverley is likewise entirely &quot;parished&quot;, each parish charging a small annual precept on council tax. Among their tasks are the management of the recreation ground, 43 allotments, upkeep of village halls and organisation of annual community events.

===Witley Common===

Witley Common, which belongs to the National Trust, directly adjoins many localities of the village. It is bisected by the A3 dual carriageway.

==Localities==
Five can be named first which form a loose cluster, though some smallholdings and playing fields buffer them: Cramhurst, Wheelerstreet, Crossways, Witley (historic centre) and Culmer.

Also in the parish are Sandhills, Brook and most of Wormley.

==Education==

* Witley Infants School, opposite the church, is a fine example of a 19th-century school constructed in 1836.
* King Edward&#x27;s School is a private school due south of the village centre.

==Transport==
* The village is served by Witley railway station, although those living in the northern part of the village are closer to Milford railway station. Both are on the Portsmouth Direct Line.

==Notable people==
* Peter II, Count of Savoy (1203-1263), Lord of the Manor of Witley in the thirteenth century.
* Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence (1338–1368), brother of Edward IV, was lord of the manor of Witley. Other owners included Godwin, Earl of Wessex, father of King Harold; Peter of Savoy; and Edward I&#x27;s wife, Queen Margaret, who commissioned oak from the village to make shingles for the roof of the King&#x27;s Hall at Westminster.
* Herbert Pease (1867–1949), British politician, was created Baron Daryngton, of Witley in the County of Surrey, on 12 February 1923.
* David Lloyd George (1863–1945), prime minister, had a house &quot;Timbers&quot;, to which he could retreat to escape the stress of high office.
* Terry Scott (1927–1994), comedian who starred in the BBC domestic sitcom &quot;Terry and June&quot; with June Whitfield, lived in the village.
* Myles Birket Foster (1825–1899), artist, is buried in the churchyard.
* Whitaker Wright (1846–1904), mining entrepreneur, was found guilty of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and committed suicide shortly afterwards. He is buried in the churchyard beneath an imposing marble slab.
* George Eliot (1819–1880), English novelist, spent her final years in the village.
* Gertrude Mary Tuckwell (1861–1951), trade unionist, social reformer and author, lived the last years of her life in Little Woodlands, Combe Lane.
*James John Joicey (1870–1932), amateur entomologist and owner of the Hill Museum.
* Frederick Williamson (1835–1900), visual artist known for his paintings of landscapes featuring sheep, is buried in the churchyard.
* Raymond Frederick Brown, founder of Racal and arms merchant for the British government
* Tony Banks (born 27 March 1950 in East Hoathly, Sussex, England), founding member and keyboardist of the progressive rock group Genesis.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==In popular culture==
James Bond&#x27;s visit to Shrublands health farm in &quot;Thunderball&quot; was inspired by author Ian Fleming&#x27;s own 1956 stay at the Enton Hall Natural Health Resort in Witley. 

Enton Mill was the subject of a painting, &quot;Sheep washing&quot;, by the 19th century artist, William Hull.

<text>This article lists the heads of state of the [[Comoros]], since the country gained independence from France in 1975.

==Term limits==
A new constitution, approved in the 2018 constitutional referendum allows the president to run for two consecutive five-year terms. Previously during the time of Union of the Comoros, there was a one-term rotational system in place to share the presidency between Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mohéli. 

==List of officeholders==
==Timeline==
==Succession==
Article 58 of the Comorian Constitution states that &quot;in case of absolute absence of a President&quot; the following should happen:
* If the absence (death, resignation, etc.) should occur within the first 900 days of the term, the cabinet ministers and other members of the government select among the ministers a &quot;main minister&quot; to serve as Interim President. Elections must also be called in no more than 60 days after the absence of the President occurs; the person who wins those elections will be president for the remainder of the original five-year presidential term.
* If the absence should occur beyond the first 900 days of the term, then the Governor of the island currently holding the presidency will assume the presidency until the end of the original five-year presidential term, at which point regular elections are held.

<text>Mitragyna speciosa is a tropical evergreen tree of the Rubiaceae family (coffee family) native to Southeast Asia. It is indigenous to Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea, where its leaves, known as kratom, have been used in herbal medicine since at least the 19th century. They have also historically been consumed via chewing, smoking, and as a tea. Kratom has opioid-like properties and some stimulant-like effects.

, the efficacy and safety of kratom are unclear. In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that there is no evidence that kratom is safe or effective for treating any condition. Some people take it for managing chronic pain, for treating opioid withdrawal symptoms, or for recreational purposes. The onset of effects typically begins within five to ten minutes and lasts for two to five hours.
Anecdotal reports describe increased alertness, physical energy, talkativeness, sociability, sedation, changes in mood, and pain relief following kratom use at various doses. Common side-effects include appetite loss, erectile dysfunction, nausea and constipation. More severe side-effects may include respiratory depression (decreased breathing), seizure, psychosis, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, trouble sleeping, and, rarely, liver toxicity. Addiction is a possible risk with regular use: when use is stopped, withdrawal symptoms may occur. A number of deaths have been attributed to the use of kratom, both by itself and mixed with other substances. Serious toxicity is relatively rare and generally appears at high doses or when kratom is used with other substances.
As of 2018, kratom is a controlled substance in 16 countries. 
There is growing international concern about a possible threat to public health from kratom use. In some jurisdictions its sale and importation have been restricted, and several public health authorities have raised alerts.
== Description ==

&quot;Mitragyna speciosa&quot; is an evergreen tree in the genus &quot;Mitragyna&quot; that can grow to a height of . Its trunk may grow to a diameter. The trunk is generally straight, and the outer bark is smooth and grey. The leaves, ovate-acuminate in shape and opposite in growth pattern, are dark green, glossy on their upper surfaces, and can grow to over long and wide. They have 12 to 17 pairs of veins. The spherical inflorescences, which are deep yellow, grow in clusters of three at the ends of the branches. The calyx-tube is long and has five lobes; the corolla-tube is long.

&quot;Mitragyna speciosa&quot; is indigenous to Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea. It was first formally described by the Dutch colonial botanist Pieter Korthals in 1839, who named it &quot;Stephegyne speciosa&quot;; it was renamed and reclassified several times before George Darby Haviland provided the final name and classification in 1859.

==Uses of the leaves==

, kratom has been studied in cells and in animals, but no clinical trials have been conducted in the United States. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stated in 2013 that there is no legitimate medical use for kratom, and in 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that there is no evidence that kratom is safe or effective for treating any condition, and that there are no approved clinical uses for kratom.

Kratom is commonly ingested by chewing, as a tea, powdered in capsules or pills, or extracted for use in liquids. Kratom is rarely smoked. Different varieties of kratom contain different relative proportions of alkaloids such as mitragynine.

===Traditional use===
In cultures where the plant grows, kratom has been used in traditional medicine. The leaves are chewed to relieve musculoskeletal pain and increase energy, appetite, and sexual desire in ways similar to khat and coca. The leaves, or extracts from them, are used to heal wounds and as a local anesthetic. Extracts and leaves have been used to treat coughs, diarrhea, and intestinal infections. They are also used as intestinal deworming agents in Thailand.

Kratom is often used by workers in laborious or monotonous occupations to stave off exhaustion and as a mood-enhancer and painkiller. In Thailand, kratom was &quot;used as a snack to receive guests and was part of the ritual worship of ancestors and gods&quot;. The herb is bitter and is generally combined with a sweetener.

===Opioid withdrawal===
Because the withdrawal effects of kratom are often reported to be less severe than those associated with traditional opioids, some people use kratom in the attempt to manage opioid use disorder, though no clinical trials have been done supporting this use. , there have been no formal trials to study the efficacy or safety of kratom to treat opioid addiction. Kratom is not approved for this or any other medical use. Stanciu et al. conducted a review of all literature and found insufficient evidence for any conclusions concerning whether kratom is harmful or whether can serve as harm reduction for those with opioid addiction. While some literature reviews claim that kratom has less potential for dependence or overdose than traditional opioids, other reviews note that kratom withdrawal itself can still be quite severe.

Data on how widely it is used worldwide are lacking, as it is not detected by typical drug screening tests. Rates of kratom use appear to be increasing among those who have been self-managing chronic pain with opioids purchased without a prescription and are cycling (but not quitting) their opioid use.

In 1836, kratom was reported to have been used as an opium substitute in Malaysia. Kratom was also used as an opium substitute in Thailand in the 19th century.

===Recreational uses===
At low doses, kratom produces euphoric effects comparable to those of coca. At higher doses, kratom produces opioid-like effects. The onset of effects typically begins within five to ten minutes and lasts for two to five hours. Some anecdotal reports describe increased work capacity, alertness, talkativeness, sociability, increased sexual desire, positive mood, and euphoria following the consumption of kratom.

According to the U.S. DEA and a 2020 survey, kratom is used to alleviate pain, anxiety, depression, or opioid withdrawal.

In Thailand, a 2007 survey found that the lifetime, past year, and past 30 days kratom consumption rates were 2.32%, 0.81% and 0.57%, respectively, among respondents aged 12–65 years, and that kratom was the most widely used recreational drug in Thailand.

Kratom may be mixed with other psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine and codeine. Starting in the 2010s, a tea-based cocktail known as &quot;4×100&quot; became popular among some young people across Southeast Asia and especially in Thailand. It is a mix of kratom leaves, cough syrup, Coca-Cola and ice. Around 2011, people who consumed the cocktail were often viewed more negatively than users of traditional kratom, but not as negatively as users of heroin. , use of the cocktail was a severe problem among youth in three provinces along the border of Malaysia and southern Thailand.

In the U.S., , kratom was available in outlets such as head shops and over the Internet; the prevalence of its U.S. use was unknown at the time. In the United States, kratom use increased rapidly between 2011 and 2017. By 2020, it was estimated that 15 million people in the U.S. use kratom.

==Adverse effects==

&quot;Mitragyna speciosa&quot; may cause many adverse effects, and in November 2017 the FDA issued a public health advisory for the drug. The side effects of kratom appear to be dose-dependent and are more common with doses that exceed 8 g. While the incidence of adverse effects in people who use kratom is unknown, a 2019 review of 935 kratom exposures reported to U.S. poison control centers over a seven-year period listed the following signs and symptoms: agitation (18.6%), tachycardia (16.9%), drowsiness (13.6%), vomiting (11.2%), confusion (8.1%), seizures (6.1%), withdrawal symptoms (6.1%), hallucinations (4.8%), respiratory depression (2.8%), coma (2.3%), and cardiac or respiratory arrest (0.6%). The study also reported two deaths and four cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome. A different 2019 review listed as common side effects: decreased appetite, weight loss, erectile dysfunction, insomnia, sweating, hyperpigmentation, hair loss, tremor, and constipation.

Kratom products in the U.S. are commonly used in doses of 2–6 g of dried leaf, and doses exceeding 8 g are relatively uncommon. Given that kratom products may vary greatly in potency, there is no standard dosing system. At relatively low doses (1–5 g of raw leaves), at which there are mostly stimulant effects, side effects include contracted pupils and blushing; adverse effects related to stimulation include anxiety and agitation, and opioid-related effects such as itching, nausea, loss of appetite, and increased urination begin to appear. At moderate to high doses (5–15 g of raw leaves), at which opioid effects generally appear, additional adverse effects include tachycardia (an increased stimulant effect) as well as the opioid side effects of constipation, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth, and sweating.

Long-term use of high doses of kratom may lead to development of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms, including loss of appetite, weight loss, decreased libido, insomnia, muscle spasms, muscle and bone pain, increased yawning and/or sneezing, myoclonus, watery eyes, hot flashes, fever, diarrhea, restlessness, anger, and sadness. This may lead to resumption of use.

Frequent use of high doses of kratom may cause tremors, anorexia, weight loss, seizures, psychosis and other mental health conditions. Kratom use may worsen existing mental health conditions. In case reports associating kratom use with psychosis, it remains unclear whether kratom use directly caused psychosis or simply unmasked the condition. Serious toxicity is relatively rare and generally appears at high doses or when kratom is used with other substances. Herb–drug interactions may result when kratom is combined with alcohol, sedatives, benzodiazepines, opioids, caffeine, cocaine, yohimbine, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Rhabdomyolysis is one of the rare and serious complications of this herb at high dosage.

In July 2016, the Centers for Disease Control issued a report stating that between 2010 and 2015, US poison control centers received 660 reports of exposure to kratom. Medical outcomes associated with kratom exposure were reported as minor (minimal signs or symptoms, which resolved rapidly with no residual disability) for 162 (24.5%) exposures, moderate (non-life-threatening, with no residual disability, but requiring some form of treatment) for 275 (41.7%) exposures, and major (life-threatening signs or symptoms, with some residual disability) for 49 (7.4%) exposures. Overall, 92.6% of outcomes were resolved with no residual disability. One death was reported in a person who was exposed to the medications paroxetine (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer) in addition to kratom. For 173 (26.2%) exposure calls, no effects were reported, or poison center staff members were unable to follow up regarding effects.

A 2019 report from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) noted that kratom use was increasing rapidly, with 1807 kratom exposures and a 52-fold increase occurring over the years 2011 to 2017. Most exposures occurred intentionally by adult males in their homes, with 32% of the incidents requiring admission to a health care facility and half of the admissions as a serious medical condition. Multiple-substance exposures were associated with a higher number of hospitalizations than kratom-only exposures and involved 11 deaths, including two due to kratom alone. Post-mortem toxicology testing detected multiple substances for almost all those who died, with fentanyl and fentanyl analogs being the most frequently identified co-occurring substances.

Overdoses of kratom are managed similarly to opioid overdoses, and naloxone can be considered to treat an overdose that results in a reduced impulse to breathe, despite mixed results for its utility, based on animal models.

From October 2017 to February 2018 in the United States, 28 people in 20 different states were infected with salmonella, an outbreak linked to the consumption of contaminated pills, powder, tea, or unidentified sources of kratom. An analytical method using whole genome sequencing applied to samples from the infected users indicated that the salmonella outbreak likely had a common kratom source.

===Addiction===
Kratom is a botanical with a known addiction liability and, in vulnerable individuals, dependence may develop rather quickly with tolerance noted at three months and four- to ten-fold dose escalations required within the first few weeks. 
A survey by Stanciu et al. of kratom consumers found that 25.5% of respondents reported symptoms consistent with a substance use disorder diagnosis based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#x27;s criteria. After controlling for variables such as age, gender, daily kratom use frequency, and a history of substance use disorders or mental health conditions, individuals with a concurrent diagnosis of another SUD had 2.83 times the odds of meeting criteria for kratom addiction compared to those without a concurrent substance use disorder diagnosis.
Kratom addiction carries a relapse risk as high as 78% to 89% at three months post-cessation. In cases of severe addiction, an approach similar to the treatment of opioid addiction may be warranted.

===Respiratory depression===
Respiratory depression is the leading cause of death from opioid use. Although evidence is sparse, the risk of respiratory depression caused by taking kratom appears to be low, but, , the Food and Drug Administration listed respiratory depression as a concern. Confusingly, a 2018 review found that the alkaloids in kratom do not induce respiratory depression.

===Liver toxicity===
In rare cases, though with a dangerous delay, kratom use has been linked to acute liver injury, with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, dark urine, itching and jaundice. Liver injury has been reported with a latency (time from first use to the onset of symptoms) of median 20.6 days. Reported liver biopsies tend to show cholestasis; however, blood biomarkers can show a range of cholestatic, mixed, or hepatocellular injury patterns. The majority of users do not seem to develop liver injury, and it is unclear which users are at heightened risk. The mechanism by which kratom causes liver damage in some people is unknown and poorly studied, but a model has been proposed.

===Death===
Kratom overdose is a subject of concern in many countries because of the associated rising number of hospitalizations and deaths in which chronic kratom use is a contributing factor. According to clinical reviews, a kratom overdose can cause liver toxicity, seizures, coma, and death, especially in combination with excessive alcohol use. Between 2011 and 2017, 44 U.S. deaths were kratom-related. However, many cases could not be fully assessed, due to limited information. People who die from kratom use typically have taken it in combination with other substances, or have underlying health conditions.

Over 18 months in 2016 and 2017, 152 overdose deaths involving kratom were reported in the United States, with kratom as the primary overdose agent in 91 of the deaths, and 7 with kratom being the only agent detected. Nine deaths occurred in Sweden during 2010–11 relating to use of &quot;Krypton&quot;, a mixture of kratom, caffeine and O-desmethyltramadol, a metabolite of the opioid analgesic tramadol.

==Pharmacology==
Kratom contains at least 54 alkaloids. These include mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG), speciociliatine, paynantheine, corynantheidine, speciogynine, mitraphylline, rhynchophylline, mitralactonal, raubasine, and mitragynaline. The alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are responsible for many of the complex effects of kratom, but other alkaloids may also contribute synergistically.

The effects of both mitragynine and 7-HMG remain disputed despite substantial study. Both are partial agonists of the μ-opioid receptor. While most data indicates agonism at all three opioid receptors, other data suggests the alkaloids are antagonists of the δ-opioid receptor with low affinity for the κ-opioid receptor. 7-HMG appears to have higher affinity at the μ-opioid receptor than mitragynine. These compounds display functional selectivity and do not activate the β-arrestin pathway partly responsible for the respiratory depression, constipation, and sedation associated with traditional opioids. Both mitragynine and 7-HMG readily cross the blood-brain barrier.

Mitragynine also appears to inhibit COX-2, block L-type and T-type calcium channels, and interact with other receptors in the brain including 5-HT2C and 5-HT7 serotonin receptors, D2 dopamine receptors, and A2A adenosine receptors. Mitragynine stimulates α2-adrenergic receptors, inhibiting the release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline); other compounds in this class include dexmedetomidine, which is used for sedation, and clonidine, which is used to manage anxiety and some symptoms of opioid withdrawal. This activity might explain why kratom can be dangerous when used in combination with other sedatives. Kratom also contains rhynchophylline, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist.

Mitragynine is metabolized in humans via phase I and phase II mechanisms with the resulting metabolites excreted in urine. In &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments, kratom extracts inhibited CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes, which results in significant potential for drug interactions.

Table 1: Pharmaceutical profile of Kratom
== Chemistry ==
Many of the key psychoactive compounds in &quot;M. speciosa&quot; are indole alkaloids related to mitragynine, which is a tetracyclic relative of the pentacyclic indole alkaloids, yohimbine and voacangine. In particular, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG) compose significant proportions of the natural products isolable from &quot;M. speciosa&quot;; e.g., in one study, mitragynine was 12% by weight from Malaysian leaf sources, &quot;versus&quot; 66% from Thai sources, and 7-hydroxymitragynine constituted ~2% by weight. At least 40 other compounds have been isolated from &quot;M. speciosa&quot; leaves, including ~25 additional alkaloids, including raubasine/ajmalicine (originally isolated from &quot;Rauvolfia serpentina&quot;), corynantheidine (also found in &quot;Corynanthe johimbe&quot;), as well as mitraphylline, mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, and rhynchophylline.

In addition to alkaloids, &quot;M. speciosa&quot; produces many other secondary metabolites. These include various saponins, iridoids and other monoterpenoids, triterpenoids such as ursolic acid and oleanic acid, as well as various polyphenols including the flavonoids apigenin and quercetin. Although some of these compounds possess antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, gastrointestinal, antidepressant, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects in cells and non-human animals, there is no sufficient evidence to support the clinical use of kratom in humans.

=== Detection in body fluids===
The plant&#x27;s active compounds and metabolites are not detected by a typical drug screening test but can be detected by more specialized testing. Blood mitragynine concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally. Detection in body fluids is typically by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

==Regulation==
, neither the plant nor its alkaloids were listed in any of the Schedules of the United Nations Drug Conventions.

In 2021, the World Health Organization&#x27;s Executive Committee on Drug Dependency investigated the risks of kratom and declined to recommend a critical review of it. The committee, however, recommended kratom be kept &quot;under surveillance.&quot;

===ASEAN===
, kratom was listed by ASEAN in its annex of products that cannot be included in traditional medicines and health supplements that are traded across ASEAN nations.

===Australia and New Zealand===
, kratom was controlled as a narcotic in Australia and under Medicines Regulations 1985 (Amended August 6, 2015) in New Zealand.

===Canada===
, Health Canada disallowed marketing of kratom for any use by ingestion and has taken action against companies marketing it for such purposes. Kratom can be marketed for other uses, such as incense.

===Europe===
, the plant was controlled in Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Sweden.

Kratom is a controlled substance in Bulgaria and Norway.

The sale, import, and export of kratom have been prohibited in the UK since 2016 under the Psychoactive Substances Act.

In 2017, kratom was designated a Schedule 1 illegal drug (the highest level) in the Republic of Ireland, under the names 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine.

=== South America ===
Chile banned Kratom in 2021.

=== Indonesia ===
Kratom was previously scheduled to become an illegal substance in Indonesia in 2024 once new regulations from the Indonesian National Narcotics Agency (BNN) go into effect. However, in 2024, a revision to a regulation by Ministry of Trade legalized production and export of kratom leaves. Later in September 2024, Indonesia&#x27;s Ministry of Cooperatives and Small Medium Business stated that Indonesia will start building downstream industries for kratom exports. These developments made kratom legal to export and manufacture in Indonesia.

===Malaysia===
The use of kratom leaves, known locally as &quot;ketum or Biak&quot; is prohibited to use, import, export, manufacture, compound, mix, dispense, sell, supply, administer or possess in Malaysia under Section 30(3) of the Poisons Act 1952, and will be punished by imprisonment or fine or both. Although prohibited by statute, the use of kratom remains widely spread especially in Northern and East Coast region of Malaysia&#x27;s Peninsula because the tree grows natively and tea decoctions are readily available in local communities. Certain parties have urged the government to penalize the use of kratom under the Dangerous Drugs Act instead of the Poisons Act, which would carry heavier penalties.

===Thailand===
Possession of kratom leaves (, ) was illegal in Thailand until 2018. The Thai government had passed the Kratom Act 2486, effective 3 August 1943, which made planting the tree illegal, in response to a rise in its use when opium became very expensive in Thailand and the Thai government was attempting to gain control of the opium market. In 1979, the Thai government placed kratom, along with marijuana, in Category V of a five-category classification of narcotics. Kratom accounted for less than two percent of arrests for narcotics between 1987 and 1992.

The Thai government has considered legalizing kratom for recreational use in 2004, 2009, 2013, and 2020. In 2018, Thailand became the first Southeast Asian country to legalize kratom for medical purposes. In 2021, Thailand fully legalized kratom and removed it from the list of Category V narcotics, and more than 12,000 people who had been convicted for kratom-related offences when it was still considered a narcotic were granted an amnesty.

===United States===
In 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the import of kratom into the U.S. due to a lack of evidence for its safety. , kratom is illegal in six states: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin, and it may be outlawed by local ordinance in other states. There was consideration in late 2017 to make kratom a Schedule I drug. In 2019, the FDA warned consumers that kratom remains unapproved for interstate commerce for use as a drug, may be unsafe in commercially available products, and is on an import alert, which can lead to confiscation of imported supplies. Efforts to schedule kratom generated significant controversy, both among the general public and the scientific community, and were ultimately unsuccessful.

==== FDA assessment ====
In April 2019, the FDA issued a statement declaring that kratom was not approved for any medical use, was potentially unsafe in commercial products available in the United States, and remained on an import alert where imported supplies would be confiscated.
On April 4, 2018, the FDA issued the first mandatory recall in its history over concerns of salmonella contamination of several kratom-containing products. Samples of the products, manufactured by Triangle Pharmanaturals, and marketed under the brand name &#x27;Raw Form Organics&#x27;, tested positive for contamination and the manufacturer did not comply with federal requests for voluntary recall. FDA Commissioner Gottlieb stated that the recall was, &quot;...based on the imminent health risk posed by the contamination of this product with salmonella&quot; and not related to other regulatory concerns. Consumers were advised to immediately discard any such products to prevent serious health risks.

In February 2018, the commissioner of the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, released a statement describing further opioid-like properties of kratom and stating that it should not be used for any medical treatment or recreational use. Also in 2018, the FDA supervised the voluntary destruction of kratom dietary supplements by a nationwide distributor in Missouri, and encouraged all companies involved in kratom commerce to remove their products from the market. On February 26, the FDA warned a California manufacturer of a kratom product called &quot;Mitrasafe&quot; that the supplement was not confirmed as safe, was not approved as a dietary supplement or drug, and was illegal for interstate commerce.

Although it was a federally legal dietary supplement, kratom was not approved as a therapeutic agent in the United States due to the poor quality of the research. In November 2017, the FDA cited serious concerns over the marketing and effects (including death) associated with the use of kratom in the United States, stating that &quot;There is no reliable evidence to support the use of kratom as a treatment for opioid use disorder; there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutic uses of kratom... and the FDA has evidence to show that there are significant safety issues associated with its use.&quot;

==== DEA scheduling ====
On August 30, 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced its intention to place the active materials in the kratom plant into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act as a warning about an imminent hazard to public safety, citing over 600 calls to poison control centers between 2010 and 2015 and 15 kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016. This drew strong protests among those using kratom to deal with chronic pain or wean themselves off opioids or alcohol. A group of 51 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and a group of nine Senators each sent letters to acting DEA administrator Chuck Rosenberg protesting the listing and around 140,000 people signed an online White House Petition protesting it.

The DEA noted the responses but said that it intended to go forward with the listing; a spokesman said: &quot;We can&#x27;t rely upon public opinion and anecdotal evidence. We have to rely upon science.&quot; In October 2016, the DEA withdrew its notice of intent while inviting public comments over a review period ending on December 1, 2016. As of July 2016, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Vermont, and Wisconsin had made kratom illegal, and the US Army had forbidden soldiers from using it. Between February 2014 and July 2016, U.S. law-enforcement authorities &quot;encountered 55 tons of kratom,&quot; or roughly &quot;50 million individual doses,&quot; according to the International Narcotics Control Board.

==== Public response ====
The FDA&#x27;s arguments for the federal prohibition of kratom have drawn both criticism and support. FDA commissioner Gottlieb responded to criticism in 2018 by stating that “The FDA has done an exhaustive review of adverse event reports, clinical literature and other sources of information related to kratom.&quot; However, in 2021, former Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs Brett Giroir claimed that the FDA&#x27;s recommendation to schedule kratom was rejected because of &quot;embarrassingly poor evidence [and] data.&quot; The FDA&#x27;s position on kratom has also been criticized by the American Kratom Association and researchers including Walter Prozialeck. Former commissioner Gottlieb continued to defend the agency&#x27;s position in 2021, stating that he was convinced that kratom was fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic, though Gottlieb&#x27;s partiality has been called into question as he has since gone on to become a member of the board of directors of Pfizer Inc., a company that has been heavily criticized for its sale and marketing of opioid drugs.

== Research directions==
Kratom is under preliminary research for possible antipsychotic and antidepressant properties.

<doc id="875205" wikidata="Q407335" url="?curid=875205" title="Cuprite">
<text>Cuprite is an oxide mineral composed of copper(I) oxide Cu2O, and is a minor ore of copper.

Its dark crystals with red internal reflections are in the isometric system hexoctahedral class, appearing as cubic, octahedral, or dodecahedral forms, or in combinations. Penetration twins frequently occur. In spite of its nice color, it is rarely used for jewelry because of its low Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4. It has a relatively high specific gravity of 6.1, imperfect cleavage and is brittle to conchoidal fracture. The luster is sub-metallic to brilliant adamantine. The &quot;chalcotrichite&quot; (from , &quot;plush copper ore&quot;) variety typically shows greatly elongated (parallel to [001]) capillary or needle like crystals forms.

It is a secondary mineral which forms in the oxidized zone of copper sulfide deposits. It frequently occurs in association with native copper, azurite, chrysocolla, malachite, tenorite and a variety of iron oxide minerals. It is known as &quot;ruby copper&quot; due to its distinctive red color.

Cuprite was first described by Wilhelm Karl Ritter von Haidinger in 1845 and the name derives from the Latin &quot;cuprum&quot; for its copper content.

Cuprite is found in the Ural Mountains, Altai Mountains, and Sardinia, and in more isolated locations in Cornwall, France, Arizona, Chile, Bolivia, and Namibia.

== As a gemstone ==
Though almost all crystals of cuprite are far too small to yield faceted gemstones, one unique deposit from Onganja in Seeis, Namibia, which was discovered in the 1970s, has produced crystals which were both large and gem quality. Virtually every faceted stone over one carat (0.2 g) in weight is from this single deposit, which has long since been mined out. The number of faceted gems over two carats (0.4 g) is difficult to estimate, but according to Joel Arem, one-time curator for the Smithsonian National Gem and Mineral Collection in Washington, D.C., faceted cuprite of any size is considered one of the most collectible and spectacular gems in existence, with its deep garnet coloring and higher brilliance than a diamond. Only the gem&#x27;s soft nature prevents it from being among the most valuable jewelry stones.

<doc id="875206" wikidata="Q413369" url="?curid=875206" title="Dioptase">
<text>Dioptase is an intense emerald-green to bluish-green mineral that is cyclosilicate of copper. It is transparent to translucent. Its luster is vitreous to sub-adamantine. Its formula is , also reported as . It has a Mohs hardness of 5, the same as tooth enamel. Its specific gravity is 3.28–3.35, and it has two perfect and one very good cleavage directions. Additionally, dioptase is very fragile, and specimens must be handled with great care. It is a trigonal mineral, forming six-sided crystals that are terminated by rhombohedra.

It is popular with mineral collectors and is sometimes cut into small gems. It can also be pulverized and used as a pigment for painting.

==History==
Dioptase was used to highlight the edges of the eyes on the three Pre-Pottery Neolithic B lime plaster statues discovered at &#x27;Ain Ghazal, known as Micah, Heifa and Noah. These sculptures date back to about 7200 BC.

Late in the 18th century, copper miners at the Altyn-Tyube (Altyn-Tube) mine, Karagandy Province, Kazakhstan thought they had found the emerald deposit of their dreams. They found fantastic cavities in quartz veins in a limestone rock, filled with thousands of lustrous transparent emerald-green crystals. The crystals were dispatched to Moscow, Russia, for analysis. However, the mineral&#x27;s inferior hardness of 5 compared with emerald&#x27;s greater hardness of 8 easily distinguished it. Eventually, in 1797, the mineralogist Fr. René Just Haüy determined that the enigmatic Altyn-Tyube mineral was new to science and named it dioptase (Greek, &quot;dia&quot;, &quot;through&quot; and &quot;optos&quot;, &quot;visible&quot;), alluding to the internal cleavage planes that can be seen inside unbroken crystals.

==Occurrence==
Dioptase is an uncommon mineral found mostly in desert regions where it forms as a secondary mineral in the oxidized zone of copper sulfide mineral deposits. However, the process of its formation is not simple. The oxidation of copper sulfides should be insufficient to crystallize dioptase, as silica is normally minutely soluble in water except at highly alkaline pH. The oxidation of sulfides will generate highly acidic fluids rich in sulfuric acid that should suppress silica&#x27;s solubility. However, in dry climates and with enough time, especially in areas of a mineral deposit where acids are buffered by carbonate, minute quantities of silica may react with dissolved copper forming dioptase and chrysocolla.

The Altyn Tube mine in Kazakhstan still provides handsome specimens; a brownish quartzite host distinguishes its specimens from other localities. The finest specimens of all were found at the Tsumeb Mine in Tsumeb, Namibia. Tsumeb dioptase is transparent and often highly sought after by collectors. Dioptase is also found in the deserts of the southwestern US. A notable occurrence is the old Mammoth-Saint Anthony Mine near Mammoth, Arizona where small crystals that make fine micromount specimens are found. In addition, many small, pale-green colored crystals of dioptase have come from the Christmas Mine near Hayden, Arizona. Another classic locality for fine specimens is Renéville, Congo-Brazzaville. Finally, an interesting occurrence is the Malpaso Quarry in and near Agua de Oro Argentina. Here tiny bluish-green dioptase is found on and in quartz. It appears in this case that dioptase is primary and has crystallized with quartz, native copper, and malachite.

==Use==
Dioptase is popular with mineral collectors, and it is occasionally cut into small emerald-like gems. Dioptase and chrysocolla are the only relatively common copper silicate minerals. A dioptase gemstone should never be exposed to ultrasonic cleaning or the fragile gem will shatter. As a ground pigment, dioptase can be used in painting. Dioptase dust is toxic due to its copper content and accidental ingestion can lead to serious health problems.

The most famous (and expensive) dioptase mineral locality is at Tsumeb, Namibia.

==Crystal structure and properties==
Dioptase is a cyclosilicate mineral consisting of Si6O18 rings which are linked together by Jahn–Teller distorted octahedral d9 Cu(II) ions. Each copper ion is coordinated by four cyclosilicate oxygens and two water molecules. Although the copper ions are six-coordinate, they can be viewed as square planar. The copper centers have approximately C4V symmetry. Each Cu(II) shares a square planar edge with another Cu(II) and corners with two more. The copper ions are responsible for the mineral&#x27;s color and magnetic properties. A broad visible absorption band at 752 nm is observed. Dioptase is anti-ferromagnetic at low temperatures (Néel temperature of 70 K). Above 70 K, it obeys the Curie–Weiss law.

<text>William Henry Draper III (born January 1, 1928) is an American venture capitalist.

==Early life ==
Draper was born on January 1, 1928, in White Plains, New York, the son of Katherine Louise (née Baum) and banker, general, and diplomat William Henry Draper Jr. who founded Draper, Gaither and Anderson and served as the first ambassador for NATO.

He attended Yale University with president George H. W. Bush, graduated in 1950, the year after George H. W. Bush, and is a member of the secret society Skull and Bones. After graduating from college, Draper served as a second lieutenant in the Korean War. Upon returning to the United States, he attended Harvard Business School and studied under professor Georges Doriot, who is often credited with starting the venture capital industry. Draper graduated with a Master of Business degree, with distinction, in 1954.

==Career==
After his graduation from Harvard Business School, Draper worked as a steel salesman at Chicago&#x27;s Inland Steel Company from 1954 to 1959.

===Early venture capital===
In 1959, Draper left Chicago to work as an associate at his father&#x27;s newly formed firm, Draper, Gaither &amp; Anderson, the first venture capital company on the West Coast. In 1962, Draper left Draper, Gaither &amp; Anderson to co-found the venture capital firm Draper &amp; Johnson Investment Company with his good friend Pitch Johnson, whom he had met while working at Inland Steel. In 1965, Draper founded Sutter Hill Ventures, which to this day remains one of the top venture capital firms in the country. During his twenty years as the senior partner of Sutter Hill, Draper helped to organize and finance several hundred high-technology manufacturing companies. In 1986, he became the head of the world&#x27;s largest source of multilateral development grant assistance, the United Nations Development Programme, and was instrumental in the leadership of several global initiatives, such as the international Education for All movement (beginning formally with the 1990 Conference in Jomtien, Thailand), the 1995 Beijing Women&#x27;s&#x27; Conference, and the 1995 Social Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark.

===Public service===
Draper has played an international leadership role in expanding the world economy and addressing the global wealth gap. He served from 1981 to 1986 as president and Chairman of the Export–Import Bank of the United States and was appointed to this position by President Ronald Reagan. In this post, Draper assumed a leadership role in U.S. efforts to sustain world trade in the face of major liquidity problems among the developing countries.

In 1986, he became the head of the world&#x27;s largest source of multilateral development grant assistance, the United Nations Development Programme. As the second highest ranking individual in the United Nations, Draper oversaw nearly 10,000 international aid projects. During his time at the UN and the Export-Import Bank, Draper traveled to 101 developing countries and met with over 50 heads of state. Under Draper, &quot;the agency&#x27;s programs grew in value from $890 million in 1985 to $1.5 billion in 1992.&quot;

===Return to venture capital===
In 1994, Draper and Robin Richards Donohoe founded Draper International, the first U.S. venture capital fund to focus on investing in private companies with operations in India. In 2002, he co-founded Draper Richards LP, a venture capital fund that invests in early-stage technology companies in the U.S., and he also founded Draper Investment Company, which concentrates on seed investments in Europe and Asia.

===Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation===
In 2002, along with Robin Richards Donohoe, Draper co-founded the Draper Richards Foundation. Robert Steven Kaplan, formerly vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs and the thirteenth president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, joined as co-chair in 2010. In 2006, Draper donated $1 million, in honor of Donohoe, to the Stanford Graduate School of Business to support the school&#x27;s &quot;Stanford Social Innovation Review&quot;.

The Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation is a global venture philanthropy firm that supports early-stage, high impact social enterprises.

The current DRK portfolio includes organizations working both domestically in the United States and internationally helping to provide critical access to healthcare, education, legal resources, economic empowerment, food security, social justice, water and sanitation, transparency and accountability, and shelter.

===Community service===
As a civic leader, Draper has been involved in many community service programs. He is currently on the boards of The Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, Freeman Spogli Institute of International Studies at Stanford University, and the Harvard Business School California Research Center Advisory Board. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the President&#x27;s Council on International Activities at Yale University.

Draper formerly served as the Chairman of the World Affairs Council of Northern California, Chairman of the Institute of International Education, as a Trustee of Yale University and as Chairman of the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco; he was a former Board member of Population Action International, the United Nations Association of the United States of America, Hoover Institution, Atlantic Council, George Bush Library Foundation, the Advisory Council of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and the World Rehabilitation Fund in New York.

==Personal life==
On June 13, 1953, Draper was married to Phyllis Culbertson by the Rev. Lowell Russell Ditzen at the Reformed Church of Bronxville. A graduate of St. Anne&#x27;s School in Charlottesville, Virginia and Smith College, she was a daughter of Mrs. Richard H. Ullman of Buffalo, New York and William Howard Culbertson of Bronxville, New York, chairman of Merrill Lynch International. Phyllis, an author of two published books of essays and poetry, served for on the boards of Save the Children, the Charles Armstrong School, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Together, they are the parents of three children:

* Rebecca Starr &quot;Becky&quot; Draper, who graduated from the Smith College and received an M.B.A. from Stanford University.
* Polly Carey Draper (b. 1955), an actress/filmmaker who is known for her starring role in the ABC television drama &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;; she also was the creator and showrunner for the hit Nickelodeon TV series &quot;The Naked Brothers Band&quot;, which starred her actor/musician sons, Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff.
* Timothy Cook Draper (b. 1958), a venture capitalist who founded Silicon Valley&#x27;s leading venture capital firm, Draper Fisher Jurvetson.

After 34 years with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Phyllis died in January 2018.

===Awards and honors===
In 1982 Harvard Business School honored Draper with its Alumni Achievement Award, and in 1992 he was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. In 1996 he received the Citizen Diplomacy Award from the International Diplomacy Council, and in 2002 he received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. In 2005 Draper received the Vision Award from SD Forum and was inducted into the Dow Jones Venture Capital Hall of Fame. In 2006 he received the Silicon Valley Fast 50 Lifetime Achievement Award and the Distinguished Service Award from the Institute of International Education. In 2009 Draper received the Global Citizen of the Year Award from International House Berkeley, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Commonwealth Club, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Business Forum, and the Philanthropic Leadership Award from the American India Foundation. In 2017, Draper received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Venture Capital Association and was awarded a medal from the Foreign Policy Association. In addition, he has received honorary decorations from Bolivia, Morocco, and Samoa. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1950 and earned a Master of Business Administration degree, with distinction, from Harvard Business School in 1954. In 2020 Draper received the Arthur C. Clarke Lifetime Achievement Award. and the UNAFF Visionary Award 2016.

<doc id="875226" wikidata="Q1494409" url="?curid=875226" title="Garnierite">
<text>Garnierite is a general name for a green nickel ore which is found in pockets and veins within weathered and serpentinized ultramafic rocks. It forms by lateritic weathering of ultramafic rocks and occurs in many nickel laterite deposits in the world. It is an important nickel ore, having a large weight percent NiO. As garnierite is not a valid mineral name according to the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC), no definite composition or formula has been universally adopted. Some of the proposed compositions are all hydrous Ni-Mg silicates, a general name for the Ni-Mg hydrosilicates which usually occur as an intimate mixture and commonly includes two or more of the following minerals: serpentine, talc, sepiolite, smectite, or chlorite, and Ni-Mg silicates, with or without alumina, that have x-ray diffraction patterns typical of serpentine, talc, sepiolite, chlorite, vermiculite or some mixture of them all.

==Composition==
Various studies have examined the composition of garnierite. In 1964, a study was done on the composition of a talc-like garnierite and found the composition to be close to the compositions of stevensite and sepiolite, but with partial replacement of the Mg content by Ni. In 1973, another study found that chemical analysis of garnierite samples yields non-stoichiometric formulae that can be reduced to formulas like those of talc and serpentine. The authors suggested a talc monohydrate formula of for the talc-like garnierite. A third study found Mg, Si, Fe, Ni and Al in the samples studied. The author determined that the compositions of all of his garnierite samples lie between the serpentine solid solution series and the sepiolite solid solution series. In 2008, yet another study used X-ray diffraction to find the composition of garnierite samples collected at the Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic. It found that each of the specimens analyzed fell into one of three groups: an Ni-talc to willemseite (up to 25 weight percent Ni) group, an Ni-lizardite to nepouite (up to 34 weight percent Ni) group and an Ni-sepiolite to falcondoite (up to 24 weight percent Ni) group. In 2011, the most recent study performed used Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis to determine the composition of their garnierite samples. It found that garnierite has an almost complete solid solution between Ni-sepiolite and falcondoite, with samples analyzed showing between 3 and 77 percent falcondoite composition. According to X-ray and thermal analysis, the garnierites of the Ural deposits are multiphase formations and consist of a serpentinites (pecoraite 2McI, chrysotile 2McI, chrysotile 2OrcI, lisardite 6T, lisardite 1T, népouite – nickel lisardite 1T), chlorites (clinochlore IIB, sepiolite, palygorskite), clay minerals (nontronite, saponite, montmorillonite, vermiculite), minerals of the mica supergroup (talc, vilemsite, clintonite, annite, phlogopite) and quartz. Calcite, sauconite, beidellite, halloysite, thomsonite, goethite, maghemite, opal, moganite, nickel hexahydrite, accessory magnesiochromite and rivsite are among the sporadic minerals found in them.

==Structure==
Garnierite is generally a fine grained mineral with poor crystalline structure. The unit cell parameters, found using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, are 13.385(4), 26.955(9), 5.271(3) Å and 13.33(1), 27.03(2), 5.250(4) Å. The space group is Pncn.

Based on the ionic radii and charge alone, Ni2+ should easily substitute for Mg2+ in octahedral coordination. The fact that Ni readily substitutes for Mg in garnierite explains why as NiO content goes up, MgO content goes down. The nickel in garnierite is not evenly distributed throughout the structure, but is concentrated in small zones of nickel surrounded by magnesium zones.
Garnierite is a layer silicate. The main difference between the serpentine-like and talc-like variants of garnierite is the spacing between layers in the structure, seen in X-ray powder diffraction studies. The serpentine-like variants have 7 Å basal spacings while the talc-like variants have a basal spacing of 10 Å. At 106 × magnifications, the 7 and 10 Å layer spacings (d(001)) are obvious and measureable, with the 7 Å spacings being better defined than the 10 Å spacings. 7 Å, serpentine-like minerals show rod and tube shaped particles, as well as platy particles and fluffy particles that are most likely aggregates while the 10 Å variety shows much less variation in particles, showing only platy and fluffy forms with very few tube or rod shaped particles. Some particles exhibit interstratification of 7 and 10 Å spacings. There is no correlation between NiO content and the shapes of the particles in the mineral. 7 Å type garnierites usually resemble chrysotile or lizardite in their structures, while 10 Å types usually resemble pimelite.

==Physical properties==
Garnierite is a green mineral, ranging from light yellow-green to dark green. The color comes from the presence of nickel in the mineral structure for magnesium. Noumeaite (later determined to be a member of the garnierite family) varies in hardness, from soft and brittle to hard enough to carve into figurines and the like. Some species of garnierite stick to the tongue and dissolve readily in water or even on the tongue. Garnierite commonly has a colloform texture, typical of minerals that fill open spaces from a solution. In general, darker green garnierites have higher Ni content, higher specific gravity and higher mean index of refraction than lighter green garnierites, which most likely relates to the inclusion of more Ni in their crystalline structure. The specific gravity of garnierite ranges from approximately 2.5 to 3. The mean index of refraction of garnierite ranges from approximately 1.563 to 1.601.

==Geologic occurrence==
Light colored garnierite is an alteration of olivine-rich rock to a clay-like mineral poor in nickel, light green to bright green garnierite is a result of the leaching of manganese oxide, magnesium, nickel and iron from the original dark green garnierite, rich in nickel, which was deposited by groundwater. This leads to a very common occurrence of garnierite as fracture fillings of millimeter to centimeter thick veins or as a fabric or coatings at the Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic. X-ray diffraction of samples from that mine show that garnierite veins include sepiolite-falcondoite and quartz (chrysoprase, a green variety of quartz with a nickel content of less than 2 weight %). Breccias found in faults at the Falcondo mine contain garnierite clasts cemented together by a secondary deposition of garnierite, which is evidence of syn-tectonic deposition of garnierite. In the garnierite deposits near Riddle, Oregon, garnierite is found as a weathering product of the underlying peridotite, with the garnierite layer between thick.

==Origin of the name==
Jules Garnier, a French geologist, published his work on the geology of New Caledonia in 1867, announcing the discovery of nickel there. Garnierite was named for Jules Garnier in a paper by Archibald Liversidge in 1874. When Liversidge sent a copy of his paper to Garnier, Garnier replied that the new mineral noumeite being described in the paper sounded very much like a mineral he had described in his 1869 paper. Liversidge decided to name the new mineral garnierite in honor of Garnier and gave the name noumeaite to a second mineral found in the same general area in New Caledonia.

<text>The Commonwealth Fund is a private American foundation whose stated purpose is to &quot;promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency, particularly for society&#x27;s most vulnerable, including low-income people, the uninsured, and people of color.&quot; It is active in a number of areas related to health care and health policy. It is led by Joseph R. Betancourt, M.D., M.P.H.

==Healthcare rankings==
Since 2004 it has produced reports comparing healthcare systems in high income countries using survey and administrative data from the OECD and the World Health Organization which is analyzed under five themes: access to care, the care process, administrative efficiency, equity and health-care outcomes. The United States has been assessed as worst health-care system overall among 11 high-income countries in every report, even though it spends the highest proportion of its gross domestic product on health care. In 2021 Norway, the Netherlands and Australia were the top-performing countries.

==History==

The Commonwealth Fund, one of the first foundations to be established by a woman, was founded in 1918 with an endowment of almost $10 million by Anna M. Harkness. The widow of Stephen V. Harkness, a principal investor in Standard Oil, Harkness wanted to &quot;do something for the welfare of mankind.&quot; Harkness&#x27;s son, Edward Stephen Harkness, became the Commonwealth Fund&#x27;s first president and hired a staff of people to help him build the foundation. Edward and his wife Mary Harkness possessed a &quot;passionate commitment to social reform&quot; and was &quot;determined to improve health and health services for Americans.&quot; Through additional gifts and bequests between 1918 and 1959, the Harkness family&#x27;s total contribution to the fund&#x27;s endowment amounted to more than $53 million. By the end of 2021 the Commonwealth Fund&#x27;s endowment stands at almost $840 million.

According to the Rockefeller Archive Center, the Commonwealth Fund&#x27;s &quot;early grants supported a variety of programs while generally promoting welfare, especially child welfare.&quot; Over the years, it has given support to medical schools and to the building of hospitals and clinics. In New York City, the Commonwealth Fund and Edward Harness largely orchestrated the merger of Columbia Medical School and Presbyterian Hospital. The merger culminated in the construction of the world&#x27;s first academic medical center then-called Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center of the in 1922. The Hospital continues to operate today as NewYork-Presbyterian / Columbia University Irving Medical Center which contains the Harkness Pavilion and the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute

In the mid-1920s, the chief interest of the foundation had become public health, including mental hygiene, community health, rural hospitals, medical research, and medical education. Other grant areas included war relief, educational and legal research, and international medical fellowships.

In 1925, the Commonwealth Fund launched its international program of fellowships called the Commonwealth Fund Fellowships (now the Harkness Fellowships). Until the 1990s, the fellowship was open to scholars of all academic disciplines, and included many who went on to excel in science, the arts and business.

From the late 1920s through the 1940s, the Commonwealth Fund supported the construction of rural hospitals, paving the way for the Hill-Burton Act in 1946. Following World War II, the foundation supported the development of new medical schools in the United States in an effort to address doctor shortages and meet the needs of communities lacking health care services. Other achievements include the Rochester Regional Hospital Council and the development of the Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant professions.

In the 1940s, the fund supported research by Dr. Georgios Papanikolaou that pioneered the Pap test as the basic technique for detecting cervical cancer. Refinement of cardiac catheterization into routine treatment resulted in a 1956 Nobel Prize for the Fund-supported researchers.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the organization focused on developing urban health care systems, and in the late 1970s, worked to improve medical school curricula. In the 1980s, the Commonwealth Fund played a prominent role in the development of the patient-centered care movement and helped draw attention to the needs of older Americans.

While the Commonwealth Fund does not typically accept donations, several gifts to the foundation have increased the endowment and expanded the scope of the Commonwealth Fund&#x27;s projects and programs:
* In 1986, Jean and Harvey Picker merged $15 million in assets of the James Picker Foundation with those of the Commonwealth Fund.
* In 1996, the Commonwealth Fund received $1.7 million from the Health Services Improvement Fund with a mandate to use the funds to improve health care coverage, access, and quality in the New York City greater metropolitan region.
* In 1999, Floriana Hogan left $100,000 to the fund, and Frances Cooke Macgregor contributed $3.1 million to the endowment in 2002.

<text>The Harkness Fellowship (previously known as the Commonwealth Fund Fellowship) is a program run by the Commonwealth Fund of New York City. This fellowship was established to reciprocate the Rhodes Scholarships and enable Fellows from several countries to spend time studying in the United States.

Recipients of the scholarship include a president of the International Court of Justice; former chairman and CEO of Salomon Brothers; a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge; the controller of BBC Radio 4; the editor of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;; former directors of the Medical Research Council, the London School of Economics and the General Medical Council; and a vice president of Microsoft.

== History ==
The Commonwealth Fund is a philanthropic foundation established in the United States by Anna Harkness in 1918. Her son, Edward Stephen Harkness, initiated the Commonwealth Fund Fellowships in 1925. These were intended to reciprocate the Rhodes Scholarships by enabling British graduates to study in the United States. In 1927 the scheme was widened by the creation of Dominion Fellowships available to graduates from universities in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. In 1929 a further category of Dominion Civil Service Fellowships was established. The awards were tenable from nine to fifteen months and candidates were to be under the age of 40.

In 1961 the Fellowships were renamed the Harkness Fellowships. In addition to the Civil Service Fellowships, a new category of General Fellowships was set up, open to people in the fields of business, banking, politics, creative arts and journalism. The maximum tenure period was extended to 21 months.

Since June 1997, the activities of the Harkness Fellowships have been limited to the field of health care. The Fellowships are now considered one of the most prestigious award programs in health policy, and accept Fellows from Australia, Canada (known as Harkness Associates), France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway (as of 2009), Switzerland (as of 2009) and the United Kingdom. They are tenable for twelve months.

==Current fellowship program==
Harkness Fellows in Health Care Policy &amp; Practice spend a year conducting research at American institutions such as Harvard University, Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, Columbia University, Stanford University, Johns Hopkins University, Kaiser Permanente, or the Veterans Health Administration. They gain an in-depth understanding of the U.S. health care system and policy challenges, enhance their research skills, and develop contacts and opportunities for ongoing international collaboration.

In addition, Fellows attend a program of seminars during the year:
*September: Orientation and Qualitative Research Methodology Workshop
*November: International Symposium on Healthcare Policy, bringing together Health Ministers from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States
*February: Washington Policy Briefing held on Capitol Hill with members of the United States Congress and senior government officials
*May: Canadian Policy Briefing on Federal and provincial health
*June: Final Reporting Seminar and the AcademyHealth Annual Research Meeting

== Administration and funding ==
The programme is funded and administered by the Commonwealth Fund of New York City, with additional support for some Fellows coming from external bodies, namely:

*B. Braun Stiftung and Robert Bosch Stiftung (Germany)
*Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (Canada)
*Careum Foundation (Switzerland)
*Nuffield Trust and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (UK)

The race takes place each year during the Cheltenham Festival in March.

The steeplechase, which is open to horses aged five years and over, is the most prestigious of all National Hunt events and it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Blue Riband&quot; of jump-racing. Its roll of honour features the names of such chasers as Arkle, Best Mate, Golden Miller, Kauto Star, Denman and Mill House. The Gold Cup is the most valuable non-handicap chase in Britain, and in 2023 it offered a total prize fund of £625,000.

==History==

===Early years===
The first horse race known as the Cheltenham Gold Cup took place in July 1819. It was a flat race, and it was contested over 3 miles on Cleeve Hill, which overlooks the present venue. The inaugural winner, Spectre, won a prize of 100 guineas for his owner Mr Bodenham.

The founding of the Cheltenham Gold Cup was an important event in the history of National Hunt racing. In the early 1920s there were very few valuable weight-for-age steeplechases. Apart from the National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham and the Champion Chase at Liverpool all the most important races were handicaps. Some people thought this was not in the best interests of the sport, so the Gold Cup was founded to redress the balance to a certain degree. It is not sure who had the idea for the Gold Cup, but it may have been Mr F.H. Cathcart, the Chairman of the Cheltenham Executive. It took a while for the prestige of the Gold Cup to grow, but it is now regarded as the true championship race for staying chasers.

The Cheltenham Gold Cup was first run as a steeplechase on 12 March 1924, over 3 miles 3 furlongs, for five year olds and upwards, with five year olds carrying 11 st 4 lbs, and the remainder 12 st. The race was covered by Pathe News. A prize of £685 was awarded to the owner of the winning horse. This was considerably less valuable than the National Hunt Chase, which was still regarded as the most important race of the meeting. The weather at Cheltenham for that first Gold Cup was mild and springlike. Among the spectators was the Prince of Wales, a friend of Harry Brown who was riding Conjuror II. There was an exciting finish, with Major E.H. Wyndham&#x27;s five year old, Red Splash, 5/1, ridden by Dick Rees and trained by Fred Withington, beating Conjuror II by a head, with Gerald L a neck away third. Forewarned, ridden by Jack Anthony, was the 3/1 favourite. Red Splash appeared to have a great future, but he was difficult to train and never again ran in the Gold Cup. 

The event originally took place on what is now the &quot;Old Course&quot; at Cheltenham. In its early years it was overshadowed at the Festival by another race, the National Hunt Chase and was worth less in prize money than the County Handicap Hurdle which had a purse of £1,000.

The Gold Cup was abandoned in 1931 (because of frost) and 1937 (flooding), but the five intervening years saw the emergence of the most successful horse in the event&#x27;s history. All five races from 1932 to 1936 were won by Golden Miller, who also won the Grand National in 1934.

During World War II, the Gold Cup was cancelled twice, in 1943 and 1944. The first multiple winner in the post-war era was Cottage Rake, who won the three runnings from 1948 to 1950. Cottage Rake was trained in Ireland by Vincent O&#x27;Brien, and his successes helped to popularise the Gold Cup, and the Festival itself, with the Irish public.

===Modern era===
The Gold Cup was switched to the &quot;New Course&quot; in 1959, and this remains the regular track used for the event. In the mid-1960s, the race was dominated by Arkle, who won three consecutive runnings from 1964 to 1966. Such was Arkle&#x27;s perceived superiority before the last of these victories that he was given a starting price of 1/10 (a £10 bet would have won £1). He remains the shortest-priced winner in the race&#x27;s history.

The first commercial sponsorship of the race was by Piper Champagne, which began supporting the event in 1972. The Tote (now known as Totesport) became the sponsor in 1980.

The most remarkable feat in the Gold Cup by a trainer came in 1983, when Michael Dickinson was responsible for all of the first five horses to finish – Bregawn, Captain John, Wayward Lad, Silver Buck and Ashley House. The 1986 winner, Dawn Run, is the only horse to have ever won both this race and the leading hurdle event, the Champion Hurdle. One of the most popular horses to win the Gold Cup was Desert Orchid, a grey who won the event in 1989. The following year&#x27;s running was won by Norton&#x27;s Coin, whose starting price of 100/1 represents the race&#x27;s longest ever winning price.

The entire Cheltenham Festival was cancelled in 2001 because of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. A replacement for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the Gold Trophy Chase, was contested at Sandown in late April, but the &quot;Racing Post&quot; stated that this &quot;lacked any strength in depth and was no substitute for the Gold Cup&quot;. The next three runnings were all won by Best Mate, who is the most recent of the four horses to have won the race three or more times.

In 2009, Kauto Star became the first horse to regain the Gold Cup. He overcame his stablemate and conqueror in 2008, Denman, who had recovered from a heart condition to take his place in the race. Timeform spokesperson Kieran Packman said of Kauto Star&#x27;s performance, &quot;it is the best Gold Cup-winning figure since the Arkle era in the mid-1960s&quot;.

One of the cups, a different one being awarded each year, was reported stolen on 14 July 2010 after a burglary at a home in Wormington, Gloucestershire.

Cheltenham Racecourse announced in September 2018 that it had been reunited with the original Cheltenham Gold Cup trophy, dating back to 1924, and will present it to the winner of the 2019 race. First awarded to five-year-old Red Splash, owned by Major Humphrey Wyndham, trained by Fred Withington and ridden by Dick Rees, it will now be re-introduced as a perpetual trophy, presented to the winning connections of the 2019 race and in future years.

In 2020 the Cheltenham Festival, and the Gold Cup in particular, was blamed for accelerating the spread of Covid-19 in the UK, being one of the last major sporting events to take place before national lockdowns were imposed by the government. In 2021 the Gold Cup was contested behind closed doors, as the rest of the festival was, resulting in a muted atmosphere. In 2022 Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to ride to victory at the Gold Cup on A Plus Tard, who she had ridden to second place the previous year.

 The race was abandoned in 1931 because of frost, and in 1937 because of flooding.

 It was cancelled in 1943 and 1944 because of World War II.

 The 1957 winner, Linwell, was trained by Ivor Herbert, a well-known racing journalist and so barred from holding a trainer&#x27;s licence.

 Tied Cottage finished first in 1980, but was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for a banned substance.

 The 2001 running was cancelled due to a foot-and-mouth outbreak. A substitute race at Sandown was won by Marlborough.

==Race sponsors==
Betfred began sponsoring the Gold Cup in 2012, after the betting company bought the Government-owned Tote in June 2011, but in late 2015 they lost their sponsorship following Jockey Club&#x27;s and Arena Racing new initiative to not allow bookmaker sponsorships on their tracks that do not offer any contribution to horse racing from their offshore business. Only two weeks later a new sponsorship deal was announced with Timico, an independent internet service provider whose CEO Tim Radford is a horse owner having top chasers like Somersby and Racing Demon associated with his name. Timico also offered an increase of £25,000 to reach a total of £575,000 prize money for the 2016 Gold Cup renewal. It was the first time that the race had been sponsored by a non-bookmaker since the Tote took over from Piper Champagne in 1980. In July 2018 Cheltenham Racecourse announced Magners Irish Cider as the new Cheltenham Gold Cup sponsor until 2021 with a possible extension to 2022. Magners ended their sponsorship early, after the 2020 race, and the 2021 race carried the name of the charity WellChild. On 24 January 2022 it was announced luxury jeweller Boodles would sponsor the Cheltenham Gold Cup from 2022.

<doc id="875258" wikidata="Q1575578" url="?curid=875258" title="Hank Ketcham">
<text>Henry King Ketcham (March 14, 1920 – June 1, 2001) was an American cartoonist who created the &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; comic strip, writing and drawing it from 1951 to 1994, when he retired from drawing the daily cartoon and took up painting full-time in his home studio. In 1953, he received the Reuben Award for the strip, which continues today in the hands of other cartoonists.

==Early life==
Born in Seattle, Washington, Ketcham was the son of Weaver Vinson Ketcham and the former Virginia King. When Ketcham was six years old, his father had an illustrator over for dinner. After dinner, this guest showed Ketcham his &quot;magic pencil&quot;, and drew some illustrations. Ketcham was immediately hooked, and soon his father set up a small desk in the closet of his bedroom at which he could draw. After graduating from Queen Anne High School in 1937, he attended the University of Washington, but dropped out after his first year and hitchhiked to Los Angeles, hoping to work for Walt Disney.

==Career==

Ketcham started in the business as an assistant animator for Walter Lantz and, starting in 1939, for Walt Disney, where he worked on &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, and several Donald Duck shorts. During World War II, Ketcham was a photographic specialist with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He also created the character Mr. Hook for the Navy during World War II, and four cartoons were made (one by Walter Lantz Productions, in color, and three by Warner Bros. Cartoons, in black and white). Also while in the Navy, he began a camp newspaper strip, &quot;Half Hitch&quot;, which ran in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; beginning in 1943. By 1944, his freelance cartoons were running in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot; magazines.

After World War II, Ketcham settled in Carmel, California, and began work as a freelance cartoonist. He built a two-bedroom redwood house and studio in Carmel Woods. In 1951, he started &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, based on his own four-year-old son Dennis. Ketcham was in his studio in October 1950 when his first wife, Alice, burst into the studio and complained that their four-year-old, Dennis, had wrecked his bedroom instead of napping. &quot;Your son is a menace!&quot; she shouted. Within five months, 16 newspapers began carrying &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. By May 1953, 193 newspapers in the United States and 52 in other countries were carrying the strip to 30 million readers.
 By 1955, Ketcham moved from his Carmel cottage to upper Carmel Valley, where he purchased the former Fred Wolferman ranch, only 40 minutes from the Monterey Peninsula. The Spanish adobe home on the Carmel Valley property was designed by architect Hugh W. Comstock with bitudobe brick. On the edge of the orchard was a Victorian ranch house for the foreman and his family, designed by architect Wilson Mizner. 

In 1958, Dennis Play Products, Inc., was created by Ketcham to distribute toys, which included the Dennis the Menace Doll, Ruff Dog, and Banshee Ball. Between 1959 and 1964 &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; was broadcast on CBS television, based on the Ketcham comic strip. The show was a great success.

In 1970, King Features Syndicate revived Ketcham&#x27;s wartime strip &quot;Half Hitch&quot; as a newspaper comic. The strip was published under Ketcham&#x27;s name, although it was drawn and written by others. The new version of &quot;Half Hitch&quot; ran until 1975.

==Family==

Ketcham&#x27;s first wife, Alice Louise Mahar Ketcham, died on June 22, 1959, of a drug overdose. The real-life Dennis was 12 when his mother died. Ketcham and Alice were separated at the time of her death. Ketcham did not inform his son of his mother&#x27;s death, or visit his son, until she was buried, and Dennis was not present at the funeral. Three weeks later, Ketcham married Jo Anne Stevens, who he met on a blind date. The family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where they lived from 1960 to 1977, where Ketcham continued to produce &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. Dennis had difficulty with his schooling, though, so was sent to boarding school in Connecticut, while Mr. Ketcham and his second wife remained in Switzerland. This marriage ended in divorce in 1968.

In 1977, Ketcham moved back to the United States and settled in Monterey, California, with his third wife, the former Rolande Praepost, whom he had married in 1969, and with whom he had two children, Scott and Dania. Dennis Ketcham served in Vietnam, suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, and had little contact with his father. Ketcham and his son were estranged for much of Dennis&#x27;s adult life.
==Later life and retirement==
When his &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; cartoon added a Sunday strip, Ketcham hired artist Al Wiseman and writer Fred Toole to produce the Sunday strips and the many &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; comic books that were published. People from around the country sent captions to him, and he would find one that he liked and illustrate the gag.

In 1990, Ketcham published a memoir titled &quot;The Merchant of Dennis the Menace&quot; chronicling his career. He retired from drawing the daily panel in 1994, when his former assistants, Marcus Hamilton and Ron Ferdinand, took over. At the time of Ketcham&#x27;s death, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; was distributed to more than 1,000 newspapers in 48 countries and 19 languages, by King Features Syndicate.

Ketcham spent his last years in retirement at his home in Carmel, California, painting in oil and watercolor. Many of his paintings can be seen in a hospital in nearby Monterey. He died in Carmel on June 1, 2001, at the age of 81. He was survived by his oldest son, Dennis; his third wife, Rolande; and their two children, Dania and Scott.

In 2005, Fantagraphics Books started publishing what was to be a complete &quot;Dennis&quot; by Ketcham from the start of the strip, collecting two years per volume, but the publishing ceased in 2009 with the 1961–1962 volume.

== Legacy ==
The Dennis the Menace Playground was designed by Ketcham and with the help of sculptor Arch Garner in 1954. The playground opened on November 17, 1956, with children&#x27;s play areas including a 1924 locomotive steam engine, donated by the Southern Pacific Railroad. A life-sized, , bronze statue of cartoon strip character Dennis the Menace was displayed at the entrance to the playground. In recent years it has been stolen twice. The statue was sculpted by Wah Ming Chang, another Disney man who resided in Carmel Valley.

<doc id="875260" wikidata="Q5917561" url="?curid=875260" title="How Democratic Is the American Constitution?">
<text>How Democratic is the American Constitution? is a 2001 book by political scientist Robert A. Dahl that discusses seven &quot;undemocratic&quot; elements of the United States Constitution.

The book defines &quot;democratic&quot; as alignment with the principle of one person, one vote, also known as majority rule. It praises the Framers of the Constitution as &quot;men of exceptional talent and virtue&quot; (p. 7) who made admirable progress in the creation of their republican government. However, it also points out that innovation and change in democratic techniques and ideals continued even after the Constitution had been codified, and the American system has not adopted all of those new ideas. He notes that the Founding Founders were partially constrained by public opinion, which included maintenance of the sovereignty of the thirteen states.

==Undemocratic elements==
The primary undemocratic aspects of the Constitution that the book sets out are:

* Tolerance of slavery – Necessary to ensure the co-operation and the participation of the Southern states, it was outlawed only after the American Civil War
* Suffrage – The voting rights of women, African-Americans, and Native Americans were not protected or specifically abridged. (In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited the denial of suffrage by race. In 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment prohibited the denial of suffrage by sex. In 1964, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment prohibited poll taxes, which were used in some states to discriminate against African-Americans without explicit racial provisions.)
* Election of the president – Article II Section 1 establishes the Electoral College, which gives each state a number of electors proportional to its representation in Congress, which, because each state has two senators, is not proportional to population. Electors were to be appointed by whatever method the state legislatures chose, and they would presumably use their own judgment in choosing a President. In modern times, all U.S. states except Nebraska and Maine use a &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; system to allocate the votes of their electors based on the outcome of the popular vote within that state, but the allocation of votes among the states has been unchanged.
* Representation in the Senate – Each state gets two senators, regardless of population. That is known as the Connecticut Compromise and was incorporated into the Constitution to secure the continued participation of the smaller states. (The book also references &quot;Sizing Up the Senate&quot; by Frances Lee and Bruce Oppenheimer.)
* Election of senators – Article I, Section 3 declared that senators were to be appointed directly by state legislatures. In 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment changed the system so that senators were popularly elected in staggered statewide races.
* Judicial power – In the United States, judges have the power to rule unconstitutional any law or regulation, even if it was duly approved by the legislature and signed by the President.. Judges are appointed (not elected) for life with a high threshold for removal, which makes them independent. Dahl feels that the judiciary has used its rather-unconstrained authority to essentially make national policy through judicial fiat.
* Limitations on congressional power – As interpreted by the judiciary, the Constitution reserves sovereignty in many domains of regulation to the states. The powers of the US Congress are limited to a specific list. From 1895 until the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, court interpretations of constitutional requirements for &quot;direct&quot; taxes made a federal income tax impracticable, which limited the revenue available to the federal government. During the Lochner era, the Supreme Court interpreted the economic powers of Congress very narrowly, and gave the federal government very little power to affect the economy. Modern judicial interpretation has allowed the federal government to have a much greater influence over the economy.

==What kind of constitution is best?==
Dahl considers the question of whether the details of the US Constitution, as amended and practiced in modern times, are superior or inferior to the constitutional systems of other stable democracies. His criteria for evaluation are:

* Political stability (that is, remaining democratic)
* Effective protection of democratic rights
* Democratic fairness
* Fosters consensus-building
* Promotes effective problem solving

===Maintaining stability===
Dahl supposes that there are certain conditions that make it easier to maintain a democracy in a given country. He writes that they seem to include &quot;the effective control by elected leaders over the military and police, a political culture supportive of democratic beliefs, and a relatively well-functioning economic order, among others.&quot; 

Dahl proposes that highly-unfavorable circumstances cause instability, no matter the constitutional systems. Under highly-favorable circumstances, a country may remain democratic in a range of possible constitutional arrangements, whether or not the system is the best kind for promoting stability. In mixed conditions, he postulates, the details of a country&#x27;s constitution may tip the balance between stability and undesirable changes, such as the conversion to dictatorship.

Dahl points out that the superiority of presidential vs. parliamentary systems in this regard is disputed and that correlation between breakdown and presidential systems in the &quot;Third World&quot; may not be indicative of a causal relationship. He seems to take the position that different systems may be better suited to the peculiar circumstances of different countries. (p. 96)

* In favor of parliamentary systems, he cites: Juan Linz and Arturo Valenzuela, eds., &quot;The Failure of Presidential Democracy: Comparative Perspectives,&quot; vol. 1. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994. In favor of presidential systems, he cites: Matthew Soberg Shugart and John M. Carey, &quot;Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics.&quot; Cambridge University Press, 1992. p. 41-42.

Dahl notes that instability is more common in new democracies:

===International comparisons===
Dahl finds meaningful comparisons to the US Constitution only in other countries with similar conditions. He says that only 22 countries, including the United States, have been &quot;steadily democratic&quot; since 1950. His book identifies the following constitutional attributes as important for comparison:

* Federalism. Is the country a federal union of strong local governments (for example, states, provinces, cantons), or a unitary state? In order to be federal, the subordinate units must be protected by constitutional law or practice, have substantial autonomy, and have substantial power to pass legislation.
* Bicameralism. Are there two houses in the legislature, both with substantial powers?
* &quot;Unequal&quot; representation in upper house. Are votes in one house of the legislature allocated by governmental subunit (for example, state, province, canton), not by population?
* Strong judicial review of national legislation: The power to declare unconstitutional laws duly passed by parliament and/or signed by the president. (That is distinct from the ability to strike down acts of subordinate governments, such as states or provinces.)
* Electoral system
** Single-Member District Plurality, also known as first-past-the-Post (FPTP). There is one seat per district, and the candidate with the most votes (a plurality) wins.
** Proportional Representation (the fairest electoral system). There are multiple seats for each voting district. They are divided up in one of several ways based on the proportion of the vote that individual candidates or political parties receive.
*** Party lists
*** Multi-member proportional (MMP)
*** Single Transferable Vote (STV)
*** Semi-PR
** French two-round system.
** Alternative vote (AV)
* Political parties
** Two-party system. Two dominant parties control the executive and the vast majority of seats in the legislature.
** Multi-party system. Three or more political parties exert significant influence in the legislature.
* Overall structure. Is there a presidential system with a strong separation of powers between the executive and the legislature, or is there a parliamentary system?

===List of countries steadily democratic since at least 1950===
The book compares the 23 stable, wealthy democracies on these criteria, summarized as follows:

===Protecting democratic rights===
Looking at Freedom House rankings, Dahl concludes that there is no discernible correlation between the seven constitutional features and ratings on political rights or civil rights among the 23 comparison countries.

===Fairness and consensus===
Dahl contrasts &quot;majoritarian&quot; governments, whose electoral system (such as first-past-the-post) can grant a dominant group (or even a minority group) decisive control over the government, with &quot;proportional&quot; systems, which make governmental control is more distributed. He concludes that proportional systems are more fair.

Proportional systems also do more to promote consensus-building, he claims, because of the need to build coalitions to form a majority.

Dahl considers the American system to be a hybrid because of its bicameral legislature and strong separation of powers, and the strong executive, which he says does not fit the mold of either category.

===Problem-solving effectiveness===
Data from &quot;Patterns of Democracy&quot; (Yale University Press, 1999) by Arend Lijphart is presented in an appendix, which ranks the U.S. on a best-to-worst scale among a varying number of countries. Ranked criteria include economic growth, unemployment, inflation, economic inequality, women&#x27;s representation, energy efficiency, incarceration rates, social spending, voter turnout, and foreign aid. Not all analysts would agree; with Dahl that all of the criteria are appropriate measures of government effectiveness, and in some cases, there are political disagreements on whether a given indicator should be higher or lower. In the rankings that are given, the United States is in the best third of one, the middle third of six, and the bottom third of eight.

Dahl states that difference in size, diversity, and economic affluence make attributing good performance on those measures to government effectiveness too difficult. He describes American performance as &quot;mediocre&quot; and concludes that changing the US Constitution to a system resembling one of the other stable democracies would not necessarily negatively impact government performance.

<text>Stare Miasto () is a part of the city of Poznań in western Poland. It was one of the five governmental districts (&quot;dzielnicas&quot;) into which the city was divided prior to 1990, and which are retained for certain administrative purposes. For details, see Administrative division of Poznań.

The Polish name &quot;Stare Miasto&quot; means &quot;Old Town&quot;. In discussing subdivisions of Poznań, the name is ambiguous; it may refer to:
*the whole area of the former &quot;dzielnica&quot; of Stare Miasto;
*the &quot;osiedle&quot; called Stare Miasto, covering most of the city centre; or
*the Poznań Old Town neighbourhood, covering only the area of the original walled city.
In this article, &quot;Stare Miasto&quot; will have the first of the above meanings. For the &quot;osiedles&quot; contained within this district, see Administrative division of Poznań.

The district of Stare Miasto includes Poznań Old Town and most of the remainder of the city centre, as well as the northern part of the city, including the modern residential areas of Winogrady and Piątkowo, and the less densely populated northernmost neighbourhoods of Morasko and Radojewo. It has an area of and a population of 161,200, making it the most populous of the city&#x27;s five districts.

Stare Miasto borders the districts of Nowe Miasto (&quot;New Town&quot;) to the east (across the Warta river), Wilda to the south, and Jeżyce and Grunwald to the west. It is also bordered by the administrative districts &quot;(gminas)&quot; of Suchy Las to the north and Czerwonak across the Warta (though without any direct crossing) to the east.

==Geography==

The southern part of Stare Miasto district is occupied by Poznań&#x27;s city centre – the Old Town itself (centred on &quot;Stary Rynek&quot;, the Old Market Square, with the Old Town Hall or &quot;Ratusz&quot;), the main street Święty Marcin (St. Martin), the old district of Chwaliszewo next to the river, the oldest buildings of Adam Mickiewicz University, and numerous other historic and modern buildings. North of the centre is the &quot;Cytadela&quot; (citadel), formerly a fortified area, now an extensive park containing a military museum and a number of cultural exhibits, and with military cemeteries (including Commonwealth and Soviet cemeteries) on its southern edge.

North of the Cytadela is the old district of Winogrady, which contains mainly houses, and then the newer Winogrady estates, consisting largely of pre-fabricated concrete panel apartment blocks. North of these are the estates of Piątkowo, built in similar style. Piątkowo is also the site of the city&#x27;s main television tower.

East of Winogrady, close to the river, is the neighbourhood of Szeląg, and north of this the housing estate of Wilczy Młyn. North of this is the Naramowice neighbourhood, and then Umultowo. West of Umultowo is the estate called &quot;Osiedle Różany Potok&quot;, named after &quot;Różany Potok&quot; or &quot;Strumień Różany&quot; (&quot;Rose Stream&quot;) which flows eastwards towards the Warta, also giving its name to the small neighbourhood of Różany Młyn (&quot;Rose Mill&quot;). North of Umultowo are two small neighbourhoods called Nowa Wieś Górna and Nowa Wieś Dolna (&quot;Upper New Village&quot; and &quot;Lower New Village&quot;), and then Radojewo, which has a palace and park complex and nature reserve. The main road continues northwards from there towards Biedrusko, passing through the adjacent military area.

Further west, north of Piątkowo, is a wide, mainly open area called Morasko (part of Poznań since 1987). The former village of Morasko itself is close to the city&#x27;s northern boundary, and contains a palace used chiefly as a convent. West of this is a nature reserve around a series of supposed meteorite craters. This reserve also contains Poznań&#x27;s highest point, the hill known as &quot;Góra Moraska&quot;, with an altitude of . The wider area of Morasko also includes the neighbourhood called Huby Moraskie, as well as the complex of buildings of Adam Mickiewicz University located just north-east of Piątkowo, used mainly for natural science teaching.

Stare Miasto contains quite extensive areas of forest, including in the area between Piątkowo and Naramowice, along the river from Naramowice northwards, and in the area of the Morasko reserve.

Poznań&#x27;s fast tram line, &quot;Poznański Szybki Tramwaj&quot; (popularly known as &quot;Pestka&quot;), runs from west of the city centre, initially as an elevated line, and then in a cutting passing through Winogrady and Piątkowo to the terminus and bus station at &quot;Osiedle Sobieskiego&quot; on the northern edge of Piątkowo. There are also older tram lines serving the southern and eastern parts of Winogrady. The main railway line running east from Poznań passes through Stare Miasto, with a station called Poznań Garbary just south of the Cytadela. There is also a relief line passing through the district further north, used for freight transportation.

==History==

The Old Town neighbourhood – the medieval walled city – constituted the city of Poznań from its founding in 1253 until 1797, when (under Prussian rule) the city&#x27;s borders were extended to take in areas to the west – the settlements of St. Martin (Święty Marcin) and St. Adalbert (Święty Wojciech). Chwaliszewo was among the areas added in the eastward expansion of 1800. During the first half of the 19th century the old city walls were taken down and the new western areas of the city (forming most of the modern city centre) were developed.

The fortifications on the Cytadela (&quot;Fort Winiary&quot;) were built between 1828 and 1842. This was part of the overall &quot;Festung Posen&quot; system of fortifications built around the city from the 1830s onwards. The left-bank fortifications all lay within today&#x27;s Stare Miasto district, following roughly the line of &quot;Al. Niepodległości&quot; and &quot;ul. Krakowska&quot;. In the later 19th century an outer ring of forts was built, of which Forts IVa, V and Va now lie within Stare Miasto district.

The next northward expansion of the city&#x27;s boundaries occurred in 1925, when the Cytadela and the area of Winogrady were incorporated into the city. Naramowice was added under Nazi occupation in the 1940s, and Piątkowo in 1974, leading to the extensive residential development of that neighbourhood (which was already underway in Winogrady). The most northerly parts of Poznań (Morasko, Radojewo, Umultowo, Nowa Wieś Górna, Nowa Wieś Dolna) were brought within the city boundaries in 1987.

<text>Nowe Miasto (; &quot;New Town&quot;) is a part of the city of Poznań in western Poland. It was one of the five governmental districts &quot;(dzielnicas)&quot; into which the city was divided prior to 1990, and which are retained for certain administrative purposes. For details (and for the current governmental division of the district into &quot;osiedles&quot;), see Administrative division of Poznań.

Nowe Miasto consists of those parts of the city which lie on the right (east) bank of the Warta river. It includes the island of Ostrów Tumski, which lies between the two channels of the river and on which the city&#x27;s cathedral stands. Nowe Miasto includes some of the most historical parts of the city (Śródka, Komandoria) as well as the extensive modern residential areas of Rataje.

The district covers an area of and has a population of 141,424 (at 30 June 2008).

Nowe Miasto borders the districts of Stare Miasto (&quot;Old Town&quot;) and Wilda to the west. It is also bordered by the administrative districts &quot;(gminas)&quot; of Czerwonak to the north, Swarzędz to the north-east, Kleszczewo to the east, and Kórnik to the south-east.

==History==

Although settlements on Ostrów Tumski and on the neighbouring east bank of the Warta were established before the end of the 1st millennium, they did not become part of the city of Poznań until after the Partitions of Poland. It was in 1800, under Prussian rule, that the ecclesiastical possession of Ostrów Tumski, including Chwaliszewo (a town in its own right since the 15th century), and the east-bank towns of Śródka, Ostrówek (a part of the Śródka district, but a town in its own right) and Łacina (or St. Roch; to the south of Śródka), were incorporated into the city of Poznań. In 1896 the small neighbourhoods of Piotrowo and Berdychowo became part of the city.

The next major expansion of the city boundaries on the east side was in 1925, when they took in Komandoria, Główna, Rataje (the western part of the area of today&#x27;s Rataje estates), and Starołęka Mała (the northern part of Starołęka). Most of the remainder of today&#x27;s Nowe Miasto district was incorporated into the city in the expansion carried out under Nazi occupation in 1940–1942. German names used at that time for districts in the east of the city included &quot;Oststadt&quot; (Główna), &quot;Heinrichstadt&quot; (Śródka, Komandoria and areas to the east), &quot;Seehof&quot; (Antonin), &quot;Johannistal&quot; (Rataje), &quot;Gutenbrunn&quot; (Kobylepole), &quot;Bamberg&quot; (Żegrze, the southern part of today&#x27;s Rataje), and &quot;Luisenhain&quot; (Starołęka).

The Janikowo neighbourhood (part of the village of Janikowo) was brought within the city boundaries in 1987.

==Geography==

The Cybina river flows through Nowe Miasto, from Swarzędz, to its confluence with the right branch of the Warta in the Ostrów Tumski region. Close to the confluence it broadens into the artificial Lake Malta, which is a popular leisure and water sports venue. There is also a series of smaller lakes further upstream. Ostrów Tumski, an island between the two branches of the Warta (of which the right one is also called Cybina), is also part of Nowe Miasto; it contains Poznań&#x27;s cathedral as well as other ecclesiastical buildings, and industrial sites to the north of these.

South of Malta are the housing estates of Rataje, one of Poznań&#x27;s largest modern residential districts, consisting mainly of prefabricated concrete panel blocks, of which the first was completed in 1967. South of Rataje is an industrial area, and then the district of Starołęka, including the smaller neighbourhoods of Minikowo and Marlewo. The most southerly neighbourhoods in Nowe Miasto (and in the city as a whole) are Głuszyna, Piotrowo and Sypniewo. To the east of Starołęka are Krzesiny and Szczepankowo, and the smaller neighbourhoods of Garaszewo, Krzesinki, Huby, Pokrzywno, Spławie and Michałowo. Krzesiny military airport (31st Air Base) is situated between Krzesiny and Głuszyna.

Between Szczepankowo and Rataje is Franowo, which is the site of a major retail park. East of Rataje are Kobylepole and Darzybór, and north of those, on the Cybina, is Nowy Młyn (&quot;New Mill&quot;). Poznań&#x27;s main zoo is situated in this area. North of this is Antoninek, to the north and east of which are Antonin, Główieniec and Zieliniec, bordering the area of forest which adjoins Swarzędz Lake (&quot;Jezioro Swarzędzkie&quot;) in the neighbouring town of Swarzędz. Główieniec is also the site of a Volkswagen factory.

A large area to the north of Antoninek is occupied by the Miłostowo cemetery, one of the two main city cemeteries (the other is at Junikowo in Grunwald district). West of Antoninek and north of Lake Malta is a residential estate called &quot;Osiedle Warszawskie&quot;; further west are the old districts of Komandoria – where the ancient Church of St. John of Jerusalem Outside the Walls stands – and Śródka. North of these is the district of Główna (including Zawady and Nadolnik), which contains a number of industrial sites and older residential quarters. A stream, also called Główna, runs through this region westwards to join the Warta. At the extreme north of Nowe Miasto is the Karolin power and heat cogeneration plant, east of which is the neighbourhood of Janikowo (which is partly a separate village outside the city).

South of Śródka is the main campus of Poznań University of Technology &quot;(Politechnika Poznańska)&quot;.</text><links>

<doc id="875288" wikidata="Q6190647" url="?curid=875288" title="Jeżyce, Poznań">
<text>Jeżyce is a area and district in Poznań in western Poland. It was one of the five governmental districts &quot;(dzielnicas)&quot; into which the city was divided prior to 1990, and which are retained for certain administrative purposes. For details, see Administrative division of Poznań.

The name &quot;Jeżyce&quot; more popularly refers to a much narrower area: the old neighbourhood (and former village) of Jeżyce, centred on the market (&quot;Rynek Jeżycki&quot;). This forms the south-eastern part of the wider district of Jeżyce discussed in this article. For the &quot;osiedles&quot; contained within this district – including one called &quot;Jeżyce&quot;, which closely corresponds to the old neighbourhood – see Administrative division of Poznań.

The district of Jeżyce covers the north-western part of Poznań, with an area of , 22% of the city&#x27;s total area. Its population of 81,300 accounts for 14.2% of the city&#x27;s total. Its population density is 1,404 people/km2.

Jeżyce is bordered by the districts Stare Miasto to the east and Grunwald to the south. It also borders the administrative districts &quot;(gminas)&quot; of Suchy Las to the north, Rokietnica and Tarnowo Podgórne to the north-west, and Dopiewo to the west.

==Geography==

The boundary between Jeżyce and Stare Miasto was marked by the streets &quot;Obornicka&quot; (the main road leading north towards Oborniki), &quot;Lechicka&quot;, &quot;Piątkowska&quot;, &quot;Księcia Mieszka I&quot;, &quot;Pułaskiego&quot; and &quot;Roosevelta&quot;. The boundary with Grunwald is marked by &quot;Bukowska&quot;, the road leading from the city centre to the airport and onwards towards Buk.

The old district of Jeżyce is a residential and commercial quarter directly west of the city centre. Its main street is &quot;ulica Dąbrowskiego&quot;, which is adjacent to the large open-air market called &quot;Rynek Jeżycki&quot; (Jeżyce Market). Close by on Dąbrowskiego are the &quot;Teatr Nowy&quot; (New Theatre) and the Rialto cinema.

Onwards from old Jeżyce, Dąbrowskiego continues as the main westerly route out of northern Poznań. It passes through the neighbourhoods of &quot;Ogrody&quot; (&quot;gardens&quot;, named after the city&#x27;s botanical gardens in the area), &quot;Wola&quot;, &quot;Smochowice&quot;, &quot;Sytkowo&quot; and &quot;Krzyżowniki&quot;. To the south, between the streets Dąbrowskiego and Bukowska, is Poznań Ławica Airport.

Much of Jeżyce consists of a belt of green land along the Bogdanka stream, which flows through the district from the north-west. It forms a number of lakes, of which the two largest are Strzeszyn Lake &quot;(Jezioro Strzeszyńskie)&quot; and Lake Rusałka, both popular bathing spots. From Rusałka the Bogdanka continues (partly underground) to Sołacz Park &quot;(Park Sołacki)&quot;, through Urbanowo, and then onwards underground to join the Warta.

North of old Jeżyce is Sołacz, an area with many large houses and the green areas of Sołacz Park. Smaller neighbourhoods in this area include Niestachów, Urbanowo, Wierzbak (a stream called Wierzbak runs underground here, beneath the street &quot;Nad Wierzbakiem&quot; – &quot;Over the Wierzbak&quot; – to meet the Bogdanka), and Bonin. North of Sołacz is the area known as Winiary. Historically the villages of Winiary were in the area of today&#x27;s &quot;Cytadela&quot; and southern Winogrady in Stare Miasto district (the names Winiary and Winogrady derive from the vine cultivation that formerly occurred there) – in the 1830s, because of the Prussian authorities&#x27; plans to build fortifications there, the inhabitants were moved to the area now called Winiary.

Between Sołacz and Rusałka lake is the Golęcin area, with the Olimpia complex of sports facilities (including a tennis venue and motorcycle speedway track), and an army training college to the north. North of these areas are the main voivodeship hospital and a Home Ministry hospital, an industrial area, and then the residential districts of Podolany. West of this is the developing neighbourhood of Strzeszyn, and to the north-west the holiday and leisure complex of Strzeszynek next to Strzeszyn Lake.
In the north-western corner of Jeżyce is Poznań&#x27;s largest lake, &quot;Jezioro Kierskie&quot; (Kiekrz Lake), used especially for sailing. North of the lake is the neighbourhood of Kiekrz (partly forming a village outside the city limits). To the east of Kiekrz is a neighbourhood called Psarskie, and to the south-west, on the western side of the lake, is Wielkie, the site of a former State Agricultural Farm.

Other sites of interest in Jeżyce include Poznań&#x27;s Old Zoo close to the city centre (from which many animals have now been moved to the New Zoo in Nowe Miasto), the tram station on ul. Gajowa, the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Saint Florian (in old Jeżyce on Koscielna Street), the Wola horse racing track, and the &quot;Tor Poznań&quot; motor racing track west of the airport.

Trams run through old Jeżyce to Ogrody, and through Sołacz to Winiary. The railway line running north-west from central Poznań passes north of old Jeżyce, dividing into two branches – the line to Piła, which has a station called Poznań Streszyn between Podolany and Strzeszyn, and the more westerly line to Szczecin, which has the stations Poznań Wola and Poznań Kiekrz. Part of Poznań&#x27;s northern relief line, used for freight transportation, also passes through the district, joining the Szczecin line close to Kiekrz.

==History==
The old neighbourhood of Jeżyce was a separate village until the expansion of the city&#x27;s boundaries in 1900 (when the region was still under Prussian rule). Sołacz was added in 1907. Golęcin and south-eastern Podolany became part of the city in 1933, during the Second Polish Republic. Most of the remainder of the district, including Ławica and Strzeszyn, was incorporated into the city during the expansions carried out under Nazi occupation in 1940–1942. Names used for parts of the district under German occupation include &quot;Jersitz&quot; (Jeżyce), &quot;Golnau&quot; (Golęcin), &quot;Sedan&quot; (Strzeszynek) and &quot;Steineck&quot; (Ławica).

Kiekrz Lake, together with the neighbourhoods of Kiekrz and Wielkie on its northern edge, were brought within Poznań&#x27;s city boundaries in 1987.

== In culture ==
Jeżyce gave its name to the popular book series by Małgorzata Musierowicz, &quot;Jeżycjada&quot;. The term was coined by professor Zbigniew Raszewski, himself a series&#x27; fan, as a tribute to the Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; (&quot;Iliada&quot; in Polish). The main characters of the series – Borejko family – live in tenement number 5 on Roosevelt&#x27;s Street in said district. While the characters are fictional, most of the places in the books are real (not excluding the tenement, which is often visited by the books&#x27; fans).

<doc id="875289" wikidata="Q5612152" url="?curid=875289" title="Grunwald, Poznań">
<text>Grunwald is a part of the city of Poznań in western Poland. It was one of the five governmental districts &quot;(dzielnica)&quot; into which the city was divided prior to 1990, and which are retained for certain administrative purposes (see Administrative division of Poznań).

The name &quot;Grunwald&quot; comes from the name of the street &quot;ulica Grunwaldzka&quot;, which had been so named in 1919 in commemoration of the Battle of Grunwald. A neighbourhood located in the vicinity of that street came to be known as Grunwald, and that name was transferred to the entire &quot;dzielnica&quot;, covering the south-western parts of the city, on its creation in 1954. The name continues to be popularly used to refer specifically to the original neighbourhood, as reflected in the names of three of the &quot;osiedles&quot; into which Poznań is now divided: &quot;Stary Grunwald&quot; (&quot;Old Grunwald&quot;), &quot;Grunwald Północ&quot; (&quot;Grunwald North&quot;) and &quot;Grunwald Południe&quot; (&quot;Grunwald South&quot;). For other &quot;osiedles&quot; contained within the wider district, see Administrative division of Poznań.

Grunwald has an area of , which is 13.8% of the total area of Poznań. Its population of 125,500 accounts for 21.9% of the city&#x27;s total. The population density is 3,467 persons/km².

Grunwald is bounded by the districts of Wilda and Stare Miasto to the east, and Jeżyce to the north. It is also bordered by the town of Luboń to the south, and the administrative districts &quot;(gminas)&quot; of Dopiewo to the west and Komorniki to the south-west.

==Geography==
The boundary between Grunwald and Jeżyce is marked by the street &quot;ulica Bukowska&quot;, which runs from the city centre to Poznań Ławica Airport (and onwards towards Buk). Grunwald&#x27;s eastern boundary largely coincides with the railway line running south and then west from Poznań&#x27;s main station &quot;(Poznań Główny)&quot;.
At the north-east corner of Grunwald is the Poznań International Fairs site. South of this is the western entrance to Poznań Główny station, and then an industrial area adjacent to the railway. Leading south-west from the station is the main street &quot;ulica Głogowska&quot;, which runs past &quot;Park Wilsona&quot; – a park named for U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, containing a band shell and Poznań&#x27;s Palm House &quot;(Palmiarnia)&quot;. Głogowska then passes through the old district of Łazarz (with its open-air market, &quot;Rynek Łazarski&quot;), crosses the western branch of the railway at Górczyn, meets the A2 motorway at the Komorniki junction at the southern edge of the city, and continues towards Wrocław. Another main route is &quot;ulica Grunwaldzka&quot;, which passes through Grunwald&#x27;s main residential areas, including Ostroróg in the north of the district, the modern &quot;osiedle Kopernika&quot; (&quot;Copernicus estate&quot;), and Junikowo and Plewiska in the south-west. Junikowo is the site of one of Poznań&#x27;s two main cemeteries (the other being at Miłostowo in Nowe Miasto). Close to Grunwaldzka&#x27;s junction with &quot;ulica Bułgarska&quot; is the city&#x27;s main football stadium (Stadion Miejski), home ground of Lech Poznań and a Euro 2012 group C venue.

North of Junikowo is an extensive green area, including the Marcelin Woods &quot;(Lasek Marceliński)&quot;. North of this are the neighbourhoods of Marcelin, Pogodno, Edwardowo, Wydmy and Ławica (which gives its name to Poznań Ławica Airport, situated just to the north in Jeżyce district).

Other neighbourhoods within Grunwald include Skórzewo to the north-west of Junikowo cemetery (adjoining a village outside the city boundary also called Skórzewo), Raszyn between Górczyn and Osiedle Kopernika, Zatorze to the east of Górczyn, and the mainly industrial Rudnicze and Kopanina south of Junikowo. Beginning between Rudnicze and Kopanina and running south is a series of small lakes, and the Junikowo Stream &quot;(Strumień Junikowski)&quot; also flows through this region, eventually reaching the Warta river in Luboń.

In the extreme south-west of Grunwald are the neighbourhoods of Fabianowo and Kotowo, and an Auchan retail park close to the A2 junction.
The areas in the heart of Grunwald, east of Łazarz, formerly contained extensive military barracks, originally built under German rule in the late 19th century to house the troops building and manning the city&#x27;s defensive forts (see Poznań Fortress). These areas are now mainly residential. Also in this area is Jan Kasprowicz Park, which contains the Arena indoor sports and concert venue, as well as other sports grounds.

The branch of the railway running west towards Berlin passes through southern Grunwald, where the stations Poznań Górczyn and Poznań Junikowo are situated. Górczyn and Junikowo are also termini for trams running along Głogowska and Grunwaldzka to the city centre; Górczyn is also a bus terminus.

==History==
Of the neighbourhoods in today&#x27;s Grunwald district, the first to be brought within the city of Poznań were Łazarz and Górczyn, in the expansion of the city boundaries which took place in 1900 (when Poznań was part of the German Empire). Most of the remainder of the district was incorporated into the city in 1940–1942, during the Nazi occupation. At this time the neighbourhoods were given German names, including &quot;Hermannstadt&quot; for Łazarz, &quot;Lenzingen&quot; for Junikowo and &quot;Steineck&quot; for Ławica.

The neighbourhood of Plewiska was brought within the city boundaries in 1987 (with part remaining outside the city as a separate village).

One historic building is the Evangelical-Augsburg Chapel, Poznań.

<text>Wilda (German &quot;Wilda&quot; or &quot;Wilde&quot;) is a southern part of the city of Poznań in western Poland. It was the smallest of the five governmental districts &quot;(dzielnicas)&quot; into which the city was divided prior to 1990, and which are retained for certain administrative purposes. For details, see Administrative division of Poznań.

The name &quot;Wilda&quot; more popularly refers to a narrower area – the old neighbourhood (and former village) of Wilda, centred on the &quot;Rynek Wildecki&quot; market. This forms the northern part of the wider district of Wilda discussed in this article, and closely corresponds to the &quot;osiedle&quot; named Wilda in the new administrative division of Poznań. The wider district of Wilda also contains two other &quot;osiedles&quot;: Zielony Dębiec (&quot;Green Dębiec&quot;) and Świerczewo.

The district of Wilda has an area of , which is 5.8% of the total area of Poznań. Its population of 63,800 accounts for 11.1% of the city&#x27;s total. The population density is 4,253 persons/km2

Wilda is bounded by the districts of Stare Miasto (&quot;Old Town&quot;) to the north, Grunwald to the west, and Nowe Miasto (&quot;New Town&quot;) across the Warta river to the east. It is also bordered by the town of Luboń to the south.

==Geography==

Poznań&#x27;s main rail station, Poznań Główny, is located in Wilda&#x27;s north-west corner, with the central PKS coach station slightly to the east. Also in the north of Wilda is Poznań&#x27;s College of Physical Education (AWF), a stadium and a number of sports facilities. South of the station is the ZNTK rail vehicle repair and manufacturing plant, and further south still is the Cegielski factory.
The old neighbourhood of Wilda lies to the east of the ZNTK plant. Its central point is Rynek Wildecki (Wilda Market Place), which contains an open-air market. The former &quot;Wilda&quot; cinema to the north of this (built 1962) has been closed since 2006, but there is now a Multikino multiplex cinema (&quot;Multikino 51&quot;, opened 1998) located at the district&#x27;s northern edge.

A belt of green land runs along the Warta river on the district&#x27;s eastern edge. To the south, this includes the Dębina park complex and water intake facility.

To the west of Dębina is the residential district of Dębiec, and west of this is Świerczewo.

==History==
Parts of the district along the left bank of the Warta became part of Poznań at the end of the 18th century, when the city&#x27;s Prussian rulers expanded its boundaries beyond the line of the medieval city walls. However the old district of Wilda did not become part of the city until the subsequent expansion of the boundaries in 1900. The Cegielski company (which had previously operated in other parts of Poznań) acquired its present site in the south of Wilda in 1919–1920, following the return to Polish rule.

Dębiec was incorporated into Poznań in the expansion of 1925 (during the time of the Second Polish Republic), and Świerczewo was added in the expansion of 1940–1942 carried out under Nazi occupation.

==Transport==
The railway line running south from the main station (initially along Wilda&#x27;s western edge) splits into three branches south of the Cegielski plant: one runs west towards Berlin, one south towards Wrocław, and one south-east towards Katowice. There are two smaller stations in Wilda: Poznań Dębiec on the southern branch, and Poznań Dębina on the eastern branch.

Trams run through Wilda from the city centre, terminating at Dębiec, which is also served by a number of bus routes.

Junction 10 of the A2 motorway (the &quot;Poznań Luboń&quot; junction) is situated south-west of the water intake, providing access to Wilda and central Poznań to the north, and Luboń to the south.

<doc id="875305" wikidata="Q930777" url="?curid=875305" title="Spider (2002 film)">
<text>Spider is a 2002 psychological thriller film produced and directed by David Cronenberg and based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Patrick McGrath, who also wrote the screenplay.

The film premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and enjoyed some media buzz; however, it was released in only a few cinemas at the year&#x27;s end by distributor Sony Pictures Classics. Nonetheless, the film enjoyed much acclaim by critics and especially by Cronenberg enthusiasts. The film garnered a Best Director Award at the Canadian Genie Awards. The stars of the film, Ralph Fiennes and particularly Miranda Richardson, received several awards for their work in the film.

==Plot==
Dennis Cleg is a schizophrenic man who has just been released from a mental institution. Known as &quot;Spider&quot;, he is given a room in a halfway house catering to mentally disturbed people which is run by unrelenting landlady Mrs. Wilkinson. While in his new abode, Spider starts piecing together his memory of an apparently fateful childhood event.

Roaming the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal, Spider starts to relive a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother Mrs. Cleg and unfaithful father Bill. Here, Spider witnesses Bill murder his mother by hitting her on the head with a spade with the passive support of his mistress, a prostitute named Yvonne. Much to Spider&#x27;s horror, she moves into the house and is presented as his &quot;mother&quot;.

Now grown up, Spider begins seeing Mrs. Wilkinson turn into Yvonne. He responds by using strands of yarn to form a web-like construction in his room, and steals Wilkinson&#x27;s keys to gain access to different rooms.

Meanwhile, Spider begins to relive a memory from childhood where he kills Yvonne by using a similar web-like pulley mechanism to turn on the gas in the kitchen. However, it appears to show Mrs. Cleg lying dead instead, implying it really was his mother all along, and Yvonne was actually a delusion.

Spider comes to this realization when he sneaks late one night into Mrs. Wilkinson&#x27;s room, still seeing her alternatively as the mistress, and appears ready to kill her, but backs away after she turns back to normal. He is then taken back to the asylum after she reports him.

==Cast==
==Production==
During a Q&amp;A session at the Kodak Lecture Series in May 2005, Cronenberg revealed that neither he, Fiennes, Richardson, nor the producers received any sort of salary during the shooting of the film. All chose to waive their salaries, so the money could be used to bankroll the under-funded production.

==Release==
The film premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

==Reception ==
===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of based on reviews from critics. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Ralph Fiennes is brilliant in this accomplished and haunting David Cronenberg film.&quot; On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 35 reviews.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3/4 stars, writing, &quot;The details of the film and of the performances are meticulously realized; there is a reward in seeing artists working so well. But the story has no entry or exit, and is cold, sad and hopeless. Afterward, I feel more admiration than gratitude.&quot; Nev Pierce from the BBC awarded the film 3/5 stars, calling it &quot;dour, thoughtful, and oppressive&quot;. Stephen Holden from &quot;New York Times&quot; praised the film, calling it &quot;as harrowing a portrait of one man&#x27;s tormented isolation as the commercial cinema has produced.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing, &quot;What catches us in &quot;Spider&quot;‘s web — besides the indelible performances of Fiennes and Richardson — is the director’s sympathy with this freak man-child who struggles to order his confused memories into a kind of truth. That’s what makes Cronenberg a world-class provocateur: His movie gets under your skin.&quot; Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; rated the film 4/5 stars, calling it &quot;an intensely controlled, beautifully designed and fascinatingly acted account of Patrick McGrath&#x27;s original novel&quot;. Mike Clark from &quot;USA Today&quot; awarded the film 3/4 stars, commending the film&#x27;s direction, cinematography, and performances, while also stating that it was not particularly &quot;sizzling&quot; as in his previous films &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;eXistenZ&quot;.

<text>Rudolph Cartier (born Rudolph Kacser, renamed himself in Germany to Rudolph Katscher; 17 April 1904 – 7 June 1994) was an Austrian television director, filmmaker, screenwriter and producer who worked predominantly in British television, exclusively for the BBC. He is best known for his 1950s collaborations with screenwriter Nigel Kneale, most notably the &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials and their 1954 adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

After studying architecture and then drama, Cartier began his career as a screenwriter and then film director in Berlin, working for UFA Studios. After a brief spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. Initially failing to gain a foothold in the British film industry, he did some scripting work for BBC Television in 1939 before the service was suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, he occasionally worked for British films before he was again hired by the BBC in 1952. He soon became one of the public service broadcaster&#x27;s leading directors and went on to produce and direct over 120 productions in the next 24 years, ending his television career with the play &quot;Loyalties&quot; in 1976.

Active in both dramatic programming and opera, Cartier won the equivalent of a BAFTA in 1957 for his work in the former, and one of his operatic productions was given an award at the 1962 Salzburg Festival. The British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Screenonline&quot; website describes him as &quot;a true pioneer of television&quot;, while the critic Peter Black once wrote that: &quot;Nobody was within a mile of Rudolph Cartier in the trick of making a picture on a TV screen seem as wide and as deep as CinemaScope.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria), Cartier initially studied to become an architect, before changing career paths and enrolling to study drama at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There he was taught by Max Reinhardt, who proved a major influence on Cartier. Reinhardt thought of a script as being similar to a musical score, which should be interpreted by a director in the same way as a musician interpreting a piece of music—an approach with which Cartier agreed.

Cartier became involved in the film industry in 1929, when he successfully submitted a script to a company based in Berlin, Germany. He then became a staff scriptwriter for UFA Studios, the primary German film company of the era, for which he worked on crime films and thrillers. While at UFA, he worked with noted writers, directors and producers including Ewald André Dupont and Erich Pommer. In 1933 he became a film director, overseeing the thriller &quot;Invisible Opponent&quot; for producer Sam Spiegel.

The same year as &quot;Invisible Opponent&quot; was released, the Nazis came to power in Germany, and the Jewish Cartier left the country. Several members of Cartier&#x27;s family who had remained in Europe, including his mother, were murdered in the Holocaust. Encouraged by a UFA colleague, Billy Wilder, to come to Hollywood, Cartier changed his surname and moved to the United States. However, unlike Wilder, Cartier did not find success in America, and in 1935 he moved again, to the United Kingdom.

In 1939, Cartier first worked for BBC Television when his script &quot;Rehearsal for a Drama&quot; was produced by the service. He had also worked on another play for the service, &quot;The Dead Eye&quot;, but due to the outbreak of the Second World War this was stopped at the production stage. Little further is recorded of Cartier&#x27;s career until after the war, when he began writing storylines for several minor British films. He also worked as a film producer, overseeing a 1951 short film adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot;. Cartier returned for a time to the United States, where he studied production methods in the new medium of television.

In 1952, Michael Barry, with whom Cartier had worked on an aborted project in 1948, became the new Head of Drama at BBC Television and interviewed Cartier for a post as a staff television producer in the drama department, a job which also involved directing. At his interview, Cartier told Barry that he thought his department&#x27;s output was &quot;dreadful&quot;, and that television drama needed &quot;new scripts and a new approach&quot;. In a 1990 interview about his career, he told BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot; that the BBC drama department had &quot;needed me like water in the desert&quot;. Barry shared many of Cartier&#x27;s views on the need to improve television drama, and he hired him for the producer&#x27;s job.

==BBC television==
Cartier&#x27;s first BBC television production was a play entitled &quot;Arrow to the Heart&quot;, transmitted on the evening of 20 July 1952. It was initially adapted by Cartier from Albrecht Goes&#x27; novel &quot;Unruhige Nacht&quot;, but Barry felt that the dialogue was &quot;too Germanic&quot; and assigned drama department staff scriptwriter Nigel Kneale to edit the script. &quot;Arrow to the Heart&quot; was the first of many collaborations between the pair, who enjoyed during the next few years a highly productive working relationship, despite profound creative disagreements on occasion. Cartier and Kneale were an important presence in the British television drama of the era and were, according to television historian Lez Cooke, &quot;responsible for introducing a completely new dimension to television drama in the early to mid-1950s&quot;.

===Collaborations with Nigel Kneale===

Cartier and Kneale&#x27;s first major production was the six-part serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, broadcast in the summer of 1953. A science-fiction story, it relates the sending of the first humans into space by Professor Bernard Quatermass and the consequences when an alien presence invades the crew&#x27;s rocket during its flight and returns to Earth in the body of the one remaining crewmember, having absorbed the consciousnesses and shredded the bodies of the other two. A critical and popular success, &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; has been described by the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline website as &quot;one of the most influential series of the 1950s&quot;. Cartier&#x27;s contribution to the serial&#x27;s success was highlighted in his 1994 obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, which also called the serial &quot;a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; led to two sequels, &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955) and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59), both produced and directed by Cartier and written by Kneale. Both were successful and critically acclaimed, and Cartier&#x27;s production work on them became increasingly ambitious. For &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, he pre-filmed a significant amount of material on location, using 35 mm film, opening the drama out from a confined studio setting with the most ambitious location shooting yet attempted in British television. Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.

The appeal of the &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials has been attributed by the Museum of Broadcast Communications to the depiction of &quot;A new range of gendered fears about Britain&#x27;s postwar and post-colonial security. As a result, or perhaps simply because of Kneale and Cartier&#x27;s effective combination of science fiction and poignant melodrama, audiences were captivated.&quot; The Screenonline website suggests that the visual impact of Cartier&#x27;s interpretation of Kneale&#x27;s scripts was a major factor in their success, which it attributes to their &quot;originality, mass appeal and dynamism... &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; became a landmark of science fiction and the cornerstone of the genre on British television.&quot;

Aside from the &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, Cartier and Kneale collaborated on several one-off dramas, including literary and theatrical adaptations of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (6 December 1953) and &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; (10 March 1955), as well as Kneale&#x27;s own &quot;The Creature&quot; (30 January 1955). Of particular note was their collaboration on an adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, originally broadcast on 12 December 1954, regarded as Cartier&#x27;s most famous work. &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s review the day after its broadcast noted its &quot;vividness... the two minutes&#x27; hate was, for instance, a wonderfully riotious orgy of vindictiveness.&quot; The production also attracted considerable controversy. There were questions asked in the House of Commons concerning some of the graphic scenes of horror in the play, and the BBC received several telephone calls threatening Cartier&#x27;s life if the second live performance, scheduled for 16 December, went ahead. The BBC took these threats seriously enough to assign him bodyguards. Cartier appeared live on television himself to defend the production in a studio debate, and eventually the Board of Governors of the BBC voted that the second performance should go ahead as planned. The production had by this time received the backing of the Duke of Edinburgh, who commented during a speech to the Royal Society of Arts that he and the Queen had watched and enjoyed the first performance.

&quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; had been a success, but it was also one of the most expensive television dramas ever made in the UK. Cartier often spent large amounts of money on his productions. Earlier in 1954, Michael Barry had heavily criticised him for the money and resources he had expended in an adaptation of &quot;Rebecca&quot;. In a memo written after that production&#x27;s transmission, Barry admonished Cartier for his over-ambitious production:

The performance of &quot;Rebecca&quot; seems to me to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by &quot;Rebecca&quot; on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.

===Later life and work===
Despite Barry&#x27;s concerns, Cartier continued to work successfully in television, and at the 1957 Guild of Television Producers and Directors Awards (later known as the British Academy Television Awards, or BAFTAs) he was the winner of the Drama category. He made a brief return to filmmaking in 1958 when he directed the feature &quot;Passionate Summer&quot;, but he saw himself primarily as a television director, and it remained his favourite medium. &quot;The essence of television is that you can control the viewer&#x27;s response to a much greater extent than other media permit,&quot; he told &quot;The Times&quot; in 1958.

Cartier also directed several operas for the BBC, a genre for which he had a great passion. He oversaw adaptations of established operas such as &quot;Salome&quot; (1957) and &quot;Carmen&quot; (1962) as well as original productions written especially for television. &quot;Tobias and the Angel&quot;, written for the BBC by Sir Arthur Bliss and Christopher Hassall and produced by Cartier in 1960, won the Merit Award in the Salzburg Opera Prize at the 1962 Salzburg Festival.

Cartier continued to direct television dramas during the 1960s, although after Barry stepped down as Head of Drama in 1961, he lost much of his creative independence. Barry&#x27;s successor, Sydney Newman, abolished the BBC&#x27;s traditional producer-director role and split the responsibilities into separate posts, leaving directors such as Cartier with less control over their productions. Cartier also found himself assigned to direct episodes of regular drama series, as such as &quot;Maigret&quot; and &quot;Z-Cars&quot;.

Cartier was still able to direct several notable productions during the decade, including a number which explored the Nazi era in Germany from which he had escaped in 1933. These included the World War II dramas &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1961, dealing with the court martial of a U-boat captain in a British prisoner of war camp) and &quot;The July Plot&quot; (1964, about the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler), as well as &quot;Firebrand&quot; (1967, about the 1933 Reichstag fire, an event Cartier had personally witnessed). He also began, for the first time, to direct pieces which dealt with the Holocaust, such as &quot;Doctor Korczak and the Children&quot; (&quot;Studio 4&quot;, 1962), concerning the Warsaw Ghetto orphanage, and &quot;The Joel Brand Story&quot; (1965, about Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s 1944 offer to the Allies of the lives of 1 million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks). Other significant 1960s productions included adaptations of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1961, starring Sean Connery and Claire Bloom) and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1962, a new version of Kneale&#x27;s 1953 script, starring Bloom and Keith Michell). &quot;Lee Oswald — Assassin&quot; (1966) was a drama-documentary telling the story of Lee Harvey Oswald, based on the Warren Commission&#x27;s findings, while &quot;Conversation at Night&quot; (1969) saw the first television acting appearance of Alec Guinness.

Cartier&#x27;s career continued into the 1970s. In 1974, he directed episodes of &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot;; and his final credit came with the play &quot;Loyalties&quot;, screened in 1976. By this time, he had worked on over 120 productions for the BBC. Subsequently, he worked for a time for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;purchased drama&quot; department, advising on which plays and series might be bought-in from European broadcasters. Throughout his career, Cartier refused to work for commercial television: &quot;I hate the idea of my creative work being constantly interrupted for commercial reasons, &quot; he once commented. &quot;I am an artist, not a salesman.&quot;

Cartier was married three times, lastly to Margaret Pepper from 1949 until his death. He had one daughter, Corinne, with Pepper, and another from a previous marriage. Cartier died on 7 June 1994, at the age of 90; his death was overshadowed in the media by that of Dennis Potter, another important figure in the history of British television drama, who died on the same day.

==Legacy==
Nearly all of Cartier&#x27;s 1950s television productions were performed live, and the majority of them were not recorded—he once described them as being &quot;gone with the speed of light&quot;. Several of those which do survive have been highly regarded by later reviewers. In 2000, the British Film Institute (BFI) compiled a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century. Voted on by a group of industry professionals, the list featured both &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. In the accompanying analysis of each entry to the list, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; was described as &quot;An early example of the power of television drama... Even now, the torture sequences retain their power to shock and disturb.&quot;

Nigel Kneale, scriptwriter of both of the Cartier dramas acclaimed by the BFI, felt that the productions would not have been as successful as they were had they been handled by any other director. &quot;I don&#x27;t think any of the things I wrote then would have come to anything much in other hands. In his they worked.&quot; Television historian Jason Jacobs, a lecturer in film and television studies at the University of Warwick, wrote in 2000 that Kneale and Cartier together created an entirely new, more expansive vision for British television drama in the 1950s.

It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale... and Rudolph Cartier... that challenged the intimate drama directly. Cartier is rightly recognised as a major influence on the visual development of British television drama... Cartier and Kneale had the ambition for their productions to affect a mass audience, and the scope of their attention was not confined to the &#x27;cosy&#x27; aesthetics of intimacy. Cartier uses the close-up both to reveal emotions and as a shock device: a more threatening—and perhaps exhilarating—method than was used before. &#x27;Intimacy&#x27; is reformulated by Cartier in terms of his power and control over the viewer—no longer a part of the family, but isolated in his home.

Cartier&#x27;s pioneering use of an increased number of pre-filmed sequences to open out the studio-bound, live television drama productions of the 1950s is also praised by Lez Cooke. &quot;While film inserts were being used in television drama from the early 1950s, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; represented the most extensive use of them in a TV play up to that time, and signalled Cartier&#x27;s determination to extend the boundaries of TV drama.&quot; Similarly, his &quot;Times&quot; obituary stated that: &quot;At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre, he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension.&quot;

In addition to his 1950s productions, several of Cartier&#x27;s later works have also been regarded as influential. His 1962 production of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was praised by Dennis Potter, then a television critic, who wrote in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; newspaper that the production &quot;was like a thunderstorm on the flat, dreary plains of the week&#x27;s television... The howl of the wind against the windows, the muted pain of Claire Bloom as the wretched Cathy, and the hunted misery of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than adequate offering of a great work.&quot; While &quot;Screenonline&quot; states that &quot;Lee Oswald—Assassin&quot; (1966) &quot;could be argued [to be] of historical interest only&quot;, due to its basis in the flawed Warren Commission report, &quot;The Times&quot; praised it as being &quot;possibly the first drama-documentary&quot;.

Not all of Cartier&#x27;s work was so well regarded; in particular, his cinematic efforts have not achieved the level of praise of his television work. In the book &quot;America&#x27;s Best, Britain&#x27;s Finest: A Survey of Mixed Movies&quot;, critic John Howard Reid says of Cartier&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;Passionate Summer&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe that... anyone could make such a dull movie. Yet this is precisely what director Rudolph Cartier has done. I&#x27;ve never heard of Mr Cartier before or since but presumably he made this brief foray into films from that synthetic world of ugly close-ups—TV.&quot;

Speaking to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1958, Cartier explained that television was still developing as a medium, and that part of his work was to help create the next generation of those who would produce television drama. &quot;The BBC is producing producers as well as plays. They are feeling their way towards what television drama will one day be, and we are trying to create a generation of writers who study the medium.&quot; His 1994 obituary in the same newspaper judged that he had been successful in creating a lasting influence on later producers, describing his 1962 production of the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; as &quot;an example and inspiration to a younger generation of television producers&quot;.

In 1990, the BBC Two arts magazine programme &quot;The Late Show&quot; produced an edition which featured a retrospective of Cartier&#x27;s work, including a new interview with the director discussing his career. A revised version of this feature was screened on BBC Two under the title &quot;Rudolph Cartier: A Television Pioneer&quot; on 1 July 1994, followed by a tribute screening of the surviving telerecording copy of the second performance of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

<doc id="875322" wikidata="Q176153" url="?curid=875322" title="Murdochite">
<text>Murdochite is a mineral combining lead and copper oxides with the chemical formula  (x ≤ 0.5).

It was first discovered in 1953 in the Mammoth-Saint Anthony Mine in Pinal County, Arizona by Percy W. Porter, a mining engineer who handpicked a 401.5-mg sample. Porter would later submit for analysis and it was then that Fred A. Hildebrand suggested that the sample was a new mineral after taking a powder x-ray picture. It was named for Joseph Murdoch (1890–1973), American mineralogist. Murdochite was first suggested to be of a cubic structure. After this suggestion, the term &quot;murdochite-type structure&quot; began to be used when describing a structure that is similar to that of murdochite. Murdochite was later found to be octahedral.

==Composition==
Various studies have examined the composition of murdochite. When murdochite was first discovered, its chemical formula was determined through stoichiometry to be Cu6·1Pb0·9O8·O. The ideal formula for murdochite was originally thought to be . This formula failed to take into consideration the significant amounts of chlorine and bromine present in murdochite. Using electron microprobe analysis, a new chemical composition for murdochite was determined that included chlorine and bromine. This new formula was and was created with regard to the Cu/Pb variance observed in samples of murdochite from both Hansonburg, New Mexico, and T. Khuni mine, Iran. This new composition was also proven incorrect and the formula that is widely accepted today,  (x ≤ 0.5), was proposed.

==Structure==
The structure originally proposed for murdochite was a simple cubic structure. This structure was later proven incorrect and determined to be octahedral. The structure of murdochite is described as edges of [PbO8] cubes spanned by Cu2+ ions that give a square-planar CuO4 arrangement in a three-dimensional network. Halogen ions complete a (4 + 2_ elongated octahedron.

==Physical properties==
Murdochite is an opaque mineral that exhibits a black color, adamantine luster, black streak, and isotropic optical class. Samples from T. Khuni mine indicate that polished sections of murdochite resemble the color and reflectivity of magnetite but vary because of zoning. The lighter zones in murdochite are caused because they are richer in lead than the darker zones. The mineral is known to be brittle, have a hardness of 4, and have {111} cleavage. Murdochite also has a pink tinge that is distinctive and its edges seem to be more reflective than the center because samples are commonly porous in the center and compact on the sides with clean-cut faces. The space group of murdochite has been confirmed to be Fm3m. Murdochite can be cubic, with a point group of 4/m 3 2/m, or octahedral and cubo-octahedral whose point group is 2 mm. Murdochite can occur in the forms (100) and (111) with crystal twinning being very common. The calculated density of murdochite was determined to be 6.1 g/cm3 and have a measured density of 6.47 g/cm3.

==Geologic occurrence==
Naturally occurring murdochite,  (x ≤ 0.5), was discovered in Mammoth Mine, Arizona. The mine, about 46 miles northeast of Tucson, contains deposits of molybdenum, lead, gold, zinc, vanadium, sphalerite, and galena. In this mine, murdochite was found embedded in plates of wulfenite as well as on the surface of crystals of fluorite. Other crystals found in Mammoth Mine include hemimorphite, willemite, and quartz. Larger masses of murdochite have also been found at the T. Kguni Mine in Anarak, Iran. Here murdochite was found in conjunction with khuniite (iranite), chrominium (phoenicochroite), plumangite and an unknown mineral with the formula Pb9O16. All these minerals are lead oxide minerals, meaning that murdochite can be found in oxidized Pb-Cu deposits. More recently, small murdochite crystals were found encrusting aurichalcite crystals in the Granite Gap Mines in New Mexico.

==Origin of the name==
The mineral murdochite is named after Joseph Murdoch, who was once a professor of geology at the University of California, Los Angeles and a past president of the Mineralogical Society of America. Professor Murdoch was born February 19, 1890, and died December 31, 1973, at 83 years of age. Murdoch obtained a baccalaureate degree, an M.S. and a Ph.D. in geologic science by 1915 from Harvard University and would first be involved in a non-geological business career before joining the faculty at the department of geology at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1928. It was here that Murdoch returned to work in the geologic field that would lead to the publishing of numerous papers which would include 23 publications ranging from the years 1913–1968, along with ten published abstracts and many book reviews.

<text>Robert Henry Lawrence Phillipson (born 18 March 1942 in Gourock, Scotland) is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Management, Society and Communication at Copenhagen Business School in Denmark. He is best known for his seminal work on linguistic imperialism and language policy in Europe.

==Education and career==
Phillipson was born in Scotland in 1942. He received his B.A. in 1964 and his M.A. in 1967, both in Modern Languages (French and German) and Law, from the University of Cambridge. He obtained his second M.A. in Linguistics and English Language Teaching from Leeds University in 1969. He earned his Ph.D., with distinction, in Education from the University of Amsterdam in 1990. He worked for the British Council from 1964 to 1973. He was associate professor in the Department of Languages and Culture at Roskilde University in Denmark from 1973 to 2000. He has been on the faculty of Copenhagen Business School since 2000. He also taught at the University of Copenhagen (1973-1984). He was Visiting Scholar at the Institute of Education at the University of London (1983), the University of Melbourne in Australia (1994), the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysore (1995), the University of Pecs in Hungary (1996) and the Center for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities at the University of Cambridge (2005). He lived with his late wife, Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, in Sweden.

He is the father of Danish actor Caspar Phillipson.

==Recognition==
On 21 February 2010, Phillipson was awarded the Linguapax Prize along with Miquel Siguan i Soler. The Linguapax Institute describes them as &quot;renowned advocates of multilingual education as a factor of peace and of linguistic rights against cultural and linguistic homogenization processes&quot;.

==Linguistic imperialism==
In his 1992 book, Phillipson made the first serious and systematic attempt to theorize linguistic imperialism in relation to English language teaching. He offered the following working definition of English linguistic imperialism: “[T]he dominance of English is asserted and maintained by the establishment and continuous reconstitution of structural and cultural inequalities between English and other languages”. In his 1997 article, Phillipson defined linguistic imperialism as &quot;a theoretical construct, devised to account for linguistic hierarchisation, to address issues of why some languages come to be used more and others less, what structures and ideologies facilitate such processes, and the role of language professionals&quot;. He recently listed seven constitutive traits of linguistic imperialism: (1) interlocking, (2) exploitative, (3) structural, (4) ideological, (5) hegemonic, (6) subtractive, and (7) unequal.

From the theoretical perspective of linguistic imperialism, Phillipson problematized five fallacies of English language teaching: (1) the monolingual fallacy; (2) the native speaker fallacy; (3) the early start fallacy; (4) the maximum exposure fallacy; and (5) the subtractive fallacy. For the past three decades, he has continued to do research on linguistic imperialism. In the 2009 collection of his previously published essays, he explained the scope and significance of such research:

<text>Realgar ( ), also known as [[arsenic blende]], ruby sulphur or ruby of arsenic, is an arsenic sulfide mineral with the chemical formula α-. It is a soft, sectile mineral occurring in monoclinic crystals, or in granular, compact, or powdery form, often in association with the related mineral, orpiment (). It is orange-red in color, melts at 320 °C, and burns with a bluish flame releasing fumes of arsenic and sulfur. Realgar is soft with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and has a specific gravity of 3.5. Its streak is orange colored. It is trimorphous with pararealgar and bonazziite.

==Etymology==
Its name comes from the Arabic &quot;rahj al-ġār&quot; ( , &quot;powder of the mine&quot;), via Medieval Latin, and its earliest record in English is in the 1390s.

==Uses==
Realgar is a minor ore of arsenic extracted in China, Peru, and the Philippines.

===Historical uses===
Realgar was used by firework manufacturers to create the color white in fireworks prior to the availability of powdered metals such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium. It is still used in combination with potassium chlorate to make a contact explosive known as &quot;red explosive&quot; for some types of torpedoes and other novelty exploding fireworks branded as &#x27;cracker balls&#x27;, as well in the cores of some types of crackling stars.

Realgar is toxic. It was sometimes used to kill weeds, insects, and rodents, even though more effective arsenic-based anti-pest agents are available such as cacodylic acid, , an organoarsenic compound used as herbicide.

Realgar was commonly used in leather manufacturing to remove hair from animal pelts. Because it is a known carcinogen and an arsenic poison, and because substitutes are available, it is rarely used today for this purpose.

The ancient Greeks, who called realgar (), understood that it was poisonous. From this, realgar has also historically been known in English as &quot;sandarac&quot;.

Realgar was also used by Ancient Greek apothecaries to make a medicine known as &quot;bull&#x27;s blood&quot;. The Greek physician Nicander described a death by &quot;bull&#x27;s blood&quot;, which matches the known effects of arsenic poisoning. Bull&#x27;s blood is the poison that is said to have been used by Themistocles and Midas for suicide.

The Chinese name for realgar is (Mandarin ), literally &#x27;masculine yellow&#x27;, as opposed to orpiment which is &#x27;feminine yellow&#x27;.

Realgar was, along with orpiment, traded in the Roman Empire and was used as a red paint pigment. Early occurrences of realgar as a red paint pigment are known for works of art from China, India, Central Asia, and Egypt. It was used in Venetian fine-art painting during the Renaissance era, though rarely elsewhere in Europe, a use which died out by the 18th century. It was also used as medicine. Other traditional uses include manufacturing lead shot, printing, and dyeing calico cloth. It was used to poison rats in medieval Spain and in 16th century England.

== Occurrence ==
Realgar most commonly occurs as a low-temperature hydrothermal vein mineral associated with other arsenic and antimony minerals. It also occurs as volcanic sublimations and in hot spring deposits. It occurs in association with orpiment, arsenolite, calcite and barite.

It is found with lead, silver and gold ores in Hungary, Bohemia and Saxony. In the US it occurs notably in Mercur, Utah; Manhattan, Nevada; and in the geyser deposits of Yellowstone National Park.

After a long period of exposure to light, realgar changes form to a yellow powder known as pararealgar (β-). It was once thought that this powder was the yellow sulfide orpiment, but is a distinct chemical compound.

<text>Linguistic Imperialism is a book written by Robert Phillipson, research professor at Copenhagen Business School&#x27;s Department of English, published in 1992 by Oxford University Press.

In &quot;Linguistic Imperialism&quot;, Phillipson argues that Western countries have used English as a tool of imperialism to dominate colonies and former colonies. He further explores the ideologies transmitted through the English language.

The book was followed by &quot;Linguistic Imperialism Continued&quot;, first published by Routledge in 2010.

<text>Willibald Karl Boskovsky (16 June 1909 – 21 April 1991) was an Austrian violinist and conductor, best known as the long-standing conductor of the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert from 1955 to 1979.

==Biography==
Boskovsky was born in Vienna, and joined the Vienna Academy of music at the age of nine. He was the concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic from 1939 to 1971. He was also, from 1955, the conductor of the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert, which is mostly devoted to the music of Johann Strauss II and his contemporaries. Along with the Vienna Philharmonic, he was also the chief conductor of the Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester up until his death. A forerunner of this ensemble was the 19th-century Strauss Orchestra founded by Johann Strauss I in 1835. He died in Visp, Switzerland.

In chamber ensemble he led the &quot;Boskovsky Quartet&quot; with Philipp Matheis (2nd violin), Gunther Breitenbach (viola) and Nikolaus Hübner (violoncello). The Boskovsky Quartet, together with Johann Krump (double-bass), Alfred Boskovsky (clarinet), Josef Veleba (horn) and Rudolf Hanzl (bassoon) formed the Vienna Octet.
Boskovsky was also a Mozart performer: he recorded all the sonatas for violin and piano, with pianist Lili Kraus, and the complete trios for violin, piano and cello, with Kraus and Nikolaus Hübner for Les Discophiles Français. He played in Brahms&#x27; Double Concerto in A minor, Op.102, with Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting the Vienna Philharmonic. Other highlights include prominent violin solos in orchstral works, including Richard Strauss&#x27;s Ein Heldenleben recorded with Clemens Krauss.

A month after his last New Year&#x27;s Concert, after having already agreed with Alfred Altenburger to conduct again in 1980, on 30 January 1979 he was hit by a stroke, which caused him a slight paralysis on the right side. In October 1979, the convalescence being too slow, he communicated his decision to give up and the orchestra asked Lorin Maazel, designated director of the Vienna State Opera, to carry on the tradition of these concerts.

He died in Visp, Valais (Switzerland) at the age of 81.

==Style==
His style appealed to many Johann Strauss I listeners as he directed Strauss&#x27; music in the manner of the &quot;Stehgeiger&quot;, i.e. directing the orchestra with the violin just as Strauss popularised this form of conducting waltzes, polkas and other dance music alongside rival Josef Lanner in the early 19th century. This tradition was also carried on by Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss after their father&#x27;s death. Boskovsky was sympathetic to the Strauss style. Apart from the Strauss family waltzes, Boskovsky recorded a 10-album cycle of the complete Mozart Dances and Marches, leading what Decca Records called the Vienna Mozart Ensemble (assorted members of the Vienna Philharmonic). Many of these recordings were included on the Philips/Polygram Complete Mozart series of CDs issued in the 1990s.

Boskovsky&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day 1979 concert was recorded live by Decca, the first commercial use of their proprietary PCM digital system. The resulting 2-LP set was well received. Quoting Gramophone magazine: &quot;This is a riotous issue ... the first recording to be manufactured and released in the UK utilizing digital recording ... astoundingly vivid and atmospheric ... the results are phenomenal.&quot; The album was most recently released as part of the Decca Legends series, remastered in 96k/24-bit PCM.

==Ensemble recordings==

<text>The &quot;Delaware&quot;-class battleships of the United States Navy were the second class of American dreadnoughts; the class comprised two ships: and . With this class, the limit imposed on capital ships by the United States Congress was waived, which allowed designers at the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair to correct what they considered flaws in the preceding and produce ships not only more powerful but also more effective and rounded overall. Launched in 1909, these ships became the first in US naval history to exceed .

The &quot;Delaware&quot;s carried a battery of ten guns in five turrets, an increase of two guns over the &quot;South Carolina&quot;s. With these ships, the US Navy re-adopted a full-fledged medium-caliber weapon for anti-torpedo boat defense. While the gun was smaller than that used by other major navies, this would, with few exceptions, become the standard medium-gun caliber for the US Navy for the better part of the 20th century. As for speed, the &quot;Delaware&quot;s were capable of , a significant improvement over the earlier class&#x27;s . This would become the speed for all American standard-type battleships. Propulsion systems were mixed; while &quot;North Dakota&quot; was fitted with steam turbines, &quot;Delaware&quot; retained triple-expansion engines. Direct-drive turbines were much less fuel-efficient, a significant concern for a Navy with Pacific responsibilities but lacking Britain&#x27;s extensive network of coaling stations.

These ships saw varied service during their careers. During World War I, &quot;Delaware&quot; was part of Battleship Division Nine of the US Atlantic Fleet, and was assigned to the British Grand Fleet. She escorted convoys and participated in the blockade of the German High Seas Fleet. In contrast, &quot;North Dakota&quot; remained on the American coast throughout the war, due in part to worries about her troublesome turbine engines. Post-war, they conducted training cruises with the US Atlantic Fleet. In 1924, &quot;Delaware&quot; was broken up for scrap metal in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. &quot;North Dakota&quot; survived until 1931, when she too was scrapped, under the terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty.

== Design ==

Prompted by the launch of and misinformation about , the US Navy and Congress faced what they perceived as a vastly better battleship than the two battleships then under construction, which were designed under tonnage constraints that Congress had imposed on capital ships. Actually, the &quot;South Carolina&quot;s were inferior only in speed to &quot;Dreadnought&quot;; they carried fewer heavy guns but, unlike &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, could bring all of them to bear on the broadside. Because of this, they could fire an equal weight of metal. Also, because greater time and care had been taken with their armor and bulkhead arrangement, they were better protected than the British ship. None of this was realized at the time. Nevertheless, the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) had struggled tremendously to design an adequate warship under congressional limits and had taken battleship design as far under those restrictions as it could. Seeing now that those limits had become unrealistic, Congress ended them; any subsequent constraints would be dictated by treaty limitations. The language of the authorizing act of June 26, 1906 was for a battleship &quot;carrying as heavy armor and as a powerful armament as any known vessel of its class, to have the highest practicable speed and the greatest practicable radius of action.&quot;

The &quot;Delaware&quot; class was the second of 11 distinct US capital ship designs begun from 1906 to 1919; some 29 battleships and six battlecruisers were laid down during this period, though seven of the battleships and all six of the battlecruisers were cancelled. Except for the s, these were all relatively slow ships, designed for no more than . They ranged in displacement from . At this time, no US dreadnought class battleship had yet hit the water as all were either at some stage of building or in design. Virtually the entire US Navy battle line was being designed by drawing on experience from pre-dreadnought designs, or from observation of foreign battleship design.

The design for these ships was actually ready in 1905 or 1906. Two variants were offered—a 10-gun version on and a 12-gun alternative on . The larger ship was rejected as too expensive for the firepower it offered, even after its displacement was reduced to tons. Also, because C&amp;R was required to consider private designs, construction on the &quot;Delaware&quot;s did not commence until 1907. None of the private designs was considered remotely satisfactory by the Navy. However, Fore River later developed its version into the battleship , which was built for the Argentine navy. While the C&amp;R design was considered superior, it still came under criticism, particularly for the poor placement of, and lack of protection for, the secondary armament.

=== General characteristics ===

The &quot;Delaware&quot;s were significantly more powerful than their predecessors, the &quot;South Carolina&quot;-class, and are mentioned by &quot;Conway&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as the first to match the standard set by the British with &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. This was due in large part to the elimination of Congressional limits on the size of new battleships; the only restriction the Congress placed on their design was that the cost of hull and machinery could not exceed 6 million USD. The &quot;Delaware&quot;-class ships were also significantly larger than the &quot;South Carolina&quot;s. They were long at the waterline and long overall. By comparison, the &quot;South Carolina&quot;-class ships were long overall. The &quot;Delaware&quot;s had a beam of and a draft of ; the &quot;South Carolina&quot;s measurements were and , respectively. The &quot;Delaware&quot;-class ships displaced at standard displacement and at full load, while the &quot;South Carolina&quot;s displaced at standard displacement and at full load. Their bows had an early example of bulbous forefeet.

=== Propulsion ===

For reasons including expected hostilities with Japan, requiring travel across the Pacific Ocean, long operational range was a recurrent theme in all US battleship designs. As an experiment, these ships received different powerplants. &quot;Delaware&quot; received triple-expansion reciprocating engines, while &quot;North Dakota&quot; was fitted with Curtiss direct drive steam turbine engines. Both ships had 14 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, both original power plants were rated at ; and both ships were capable of reaching 21 knots. Chief Constructor Washington L. Capps predicted &quot;North Dakota&quot; would have a 25 percent shorter radius than &quot;Delaware&quot; at 16 knots and 45 percent less at 14 knots, based on tank tests and the known performance of steam turbines at that time. This estimate was proved true during the ships&#x27; trial runs in 1909. Also, because &quot;Delaware&quot;″s engine bearings were equipped with forced lubrication instead of a gravity-fed system, she was able to steam at full speed for 24 hours without any need for engine repair. This would normally have been unthinkable as reciprocating engines were known generally to shake themselves apart if run at full power for long. However, this penchant for reliability came under question in the late 1930s as battleships with reciprocating engines performed poorly in the Pacific. By 1917, more powerful and efficient geared turbines had been installed in &quot;North Dakota&quot; to replace her Curtiss turbines. These provided horsepower, some greater than her original engines.

=== Armament ===

==== Main guns ====

The &quot;Delaware&quot;-class ships were armed with ten 12-inch/45 caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin gun turrets; this was an addition of two guns compared to the preceding &quot;South Carolina&quot;s. The gun housings were the Mark 7 type, and they allowed for depression to −5 degrees and elevation to 15 degrees. The guns had a rate of fire of 2 to 3 rounds per minute. They fired shells, of either armor-piercing (AP) or Common types, though the Common type was obsolete by 1915 and put out of production. The propellant charge was in silk bags, and provided a muzzle velocity of . The guns were expected to fire 175 rounds before the barrels would require replacement. The two ships carried 100 shells per gun, or 1,000 rounds in total. At 15 degrees elevation, the guns could hit targets out to approximately .

Two turrets were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The placement of the rear gun turrets proved problematic. Capps placed the rear superfiring turret, Number 3, closest amidships. Since it represented the greatest weight borne by the ship&#x27;s structure due to its tall barbette, this placement would allow it support by the greatest amount of underwater volume available. The other two rear turrets, Numbers 4 and 5, were placed level and back to back. This arrangement was detrimental in two ways. First, Number 3 could not fire astern with Number 4 trained forward, which left only the two 12&quot; guns of Number 5 to do so. Second, because the engine room was situated between Numbers 3 and 4, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.

Another challenge with the main armament was that its weight, per turret, which had to be spread over much of the hull, led to increased stress on the structure. The closer the weight of the heavy guns to the ends, the greater the stress and risk for structural failure due to metal fatigue. High speed required fine ends, which were not especially buoyant, and the amount of space needed amidships for machinery precluded moving the main turrets further inboard. Not having to worry about a displacement limit allowed Capps the option of deepening the hull, which helped to some extent. He added a forecastle to allow for better seakeeping and to make room for officers&#x27; quarters and restored the full height of the hull aft. The problem itself, however remained.

==== Secondary guns ====

The Naval War College in its 1905 Newport Summer Conference considered the guns fitted to the &quot;South Carolina&quot; class too light for effective anti-torpedo-boat defense. A committee on this issue formed during the conference suggested that a gun with a high velocity and flat trajectory would work best—one powerful enough to smash an attacking vessel yet light enough for easy handling and rapid firing. For this purpose, the committee found 5-inch guns appeared best suited. During the &quot;Delaware&quot;s&#x27; design, C&amp;R considered guns but concerns voiced by the Naval War College about the lack of heavy splinter protection for these guns and smoke uptakes led to an adaption of 5-inch /50 caliber guns to balance the increase in armor weight.

The &quot;Delaware&quot;s mounted fourteen 5-inch/50 caliber Mark 6 guns, two forward on the main deck, 10 in casemates on the side and two aft on the main deck abeam No. 5 turret. They had a rate of fire of 6 to 8 rounds per minute. They fired three types of rounds: a &quot;light&quot; AP shell that weighed and a &quot;heavy&quot; AP round that weighed . The third type was the Common Mark 15 shell, which also weighed 50 lb. The 50 lb shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of , while the larger 60 lb shells traveled at a slightly slower . The guns were emplaced on both Mark 9 and Mark 12 pedestal mounts; the Mark 9 version limited elevation to 15 degrees, while the Mark 12 allowed for up to 25 degrees. The 5-inch/50 was able to penetrate most effectively at , which was the deciding factor in the decision to equip the &quot;Delaware&quot; class with them. The 5-inch guns were supplied with a total of 240 rounds per barrel.

While these guns were considered an improvement by the Navy over that of the &quot;South Carolina&quot;s, their placement remained problematic as even in calm water, they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man. The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials. The casemate-mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided the majority of the complaints from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking the flow of the bow wave imparting extra drag on the design.

==== Anti-aircraft guns ====

As with the &quot;South Carolina&quot; class, these ships were fitted with two 3-inch/50 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) guns in Mark 11 mounts in 1917. The Mark 11 mount was the first 3-inch AA mounting issued by the US Navy. They had a trunnion height of compared to a height of for the pedestal mountings used against surface craft. This allowed them an elevation range between −10 and 85 degrees. Maximum range was at 43 degrees and maximum ceiling at 85 degrees.

==== Torpedo tubes ====

The &quot;Delaware&quot;s carried two torpedo tubes below the waterline. The Bliss-Leavitt 21-inch Mark 3 Model 1 torpedo designed for these tubes had an overall length of , a weight of and propelled an explosive charge of of TNT to a range of at a speed of 

=== Armor ===

The armored belt ranged in thickness from in the more important areas of the ship. Casemated guns mounted in the hull had between of armor plate. The barbettes that housed the main gun turrets were armored with between of armor; the side portions more vulnerable to shell fire were thicker, while the front and rear sections of the barbette, which were less likely to be hit, received thinner armor to save weight. The gun turrets themselves were armored with of armor. The conning tower was thick. As in the designs of all early dreadnoughts, the deck armor was very thin at in most areas and over machinery and magazine spaces. These ships were expected to do most of their firing at ranges less than . At such distances, deck strikes would be a rare event.

== Service history ==
=== USS &quot;Delaware&quot; ===

During trials, &quot;Delaware&quot; was run at full speed for 24 hours straight to prove that her machinery could handle the stress. She was the first American battleship to achieve the feat. Late in 1910, &quot;Delaware&quot; sailed to Europe, followed by a trip to South America early in 1911. She made a further two voyages to Europe in 1912 and 1913, before returning to the US Atlantic Fleet for training exercises that were conducted in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. &quot;Delaware&quot; took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in April–May 1914.

When the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, &quot;Delaware&quot; was initially tasked with readiness training off the East Coast. Late in the year, she was deployed to Europe as part of the US Navy&#x27;s Battleship Division Nine, under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman. The force arrived on 7 December and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. In July 1918, &quot;Delaware&quot; was withdrawn from overseas service and returned to the United States.

In 1920, the US Navy adopted hull numbers for its ships; &quot;Delaware&quot; was assigned the hull number BB-28. &quot;Delaware&quot; made only two more cruises, both for midshipmen, under her new identification number: one in 1922 and the second in early 1923. &quot;Delaware&quot; sailed to Europe on the second trip, and stopped at a number of ports, including Gibraltar. She returned to the US in August of that year, at which point her crew was reassigned to the newer battleship . She was then taken to the Boston Navy Yard, where her armaments were removed. The ship was decommissioned in November 1923 and sold to shipbreakers in February 1924.

=== USS &quot;North Dakota&quot; ===

Upon commissioning, the ship was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, alongside her sister &quot;Delaware&quot;. Her first overseas cruise came in November 1910, when she steamed across the Atlantic to visit France and Britain. &quot;North Dakota&quot; also took part in the invasion of Vera Cruz in 1914. Unlike her sister, &quot;North Dakota&quot; remained off the American coast for the duration of the United States&#x27; involvement in World War I. Hugh Rodman, the commander of the American expeditionary force, specifically requested that &quot;North Dakota&quot; be kept stateside; he felt her turbine engines were too unreliable for the ship to be deployed to a war zone. In 1917, her engines were replaced with new geared turbines, and new fire control equipment was installed.

From 1917, she was employed as a training ship for gunners and engineers. Post-war, &quot;North Dakota&quot; made a second trip to Europe, primarily to ports in the Mediterranean Sea. During the visit, the ship was tasked with the return of the remains of the Italian ambassador, Vincenzo Macchi di Cellere, who had died 20 October 1919 in Washington, DC. The ship participated in the aerial bombing demonstrations off the Virginia Capes in 1921. In 1923, a third trip to Europe, this time with midshipmen from the Naval Academy aboard. The ship stopped in Spain, Scotland, and Scandinavia.

Like her sister, she was relegated to the surplus naval forces that had to be dismantled under the Washington Naval Treaty. In November 1923, &quot;North Dakota&quot; was decommissioned; she had her armaments removed in 1924, after which she was converted into a target ship. She was redesignated as &quot;unclassified&quot;, and served as a target until 1931, when she was scrapped.

<text>Phyllite ( ) is a type of foliated metamorphic rock formed from slate that is further metamorphosed so that very fine grained white mica achieves a preferred orientation. It is primarily composed of quartz, sericite mica, and chlorite.

Phyllite has fine-grained mica flakes, whereas slate has extremely fine mica flakes, and schist has large mica flakes, all mica flakes of which have achieved a preferred orientation. Among foliated metamorphic rocks, it represents a gradation in the degree of metamorphism between slate and schist.

The minute crystals of graphite, sericite, or chlorite, or the translucent fine-grained white mica, impart a silky, sometimes golden sheen to the surfaces of cleavage, called &quot;phyllitic luster&quot;.

The word comes from the Greek &quot;phyllon&quot;, meaning &quot;leaf&quot;.

The protolith (or parent rock) for phyllite is shale or pelite; or slate, which in turn came from a shale protolith. Its constituent platy minerals are larger than those in slate but are not visible with the naked eye. Phyllites are said to have a texture called &quot;phyllitic sheen,&quot; and are usually classified as having formed through low-grade metamorphic conditions through regional metamorphism metamorphic facies.

Phyllite has good fissility (a tendency to split into sheets). Phyllites are usually black to gray or light greenish gray in color. The foliation is commonly crinkled or wavy in appearance. Phyllites are mostly used in decorative aggregates, interior decors, building stones, facing stones, garden decoration and curbing. Cemetery markers, commemorative tablets, creating artworks and writing slates are some of its commercial uses.

Phyllite is commonly found in the Dalradian metasediments of northwest Arran. In north Cornwall, there are Tredorn phyllites and Woolgarden phyllites.

Carolina &quot;slate&quot; is often volcanic phyllite. A type of Carolina slate, Duke stone, is a dacitic phyllite that is fractured and colored with iron oxide.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberal parties in [[Bolivia]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Introduction==
Liberalism was organized as a part of the oligarchy as the opposition to conservatism. It didn&#x27;t survive the 1952 revolution.

==The timeline==

===Liberal Party===
*1883: Liberals formed the Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal&quot;)
*1913: A dissident faction of the Liberal Party formed Radical Party (&quot;Partido Radical&quot;)
*1943: After the revolution of 1943 the Partido Radical disappeared.
*1952: After the revolution of 1952 the Partido Liberal de facto disappeared as a political party

<doc id="875367" wikidata="Q570069" url="?curid=875367" title="Selenographic coordinate system">
<text>The selenographic coordinate system is used to refer to locations on the surface of Earth&#x27;s moon. Any position on the lunar surface can be referenced by specifying two numerical values, which are comparable to the latitude and longitude of Earth. The longitude gives the position east or west of the Moon&#x27;s prime meridian, which is the line passing from the lunar north pole through the point on the lunar surface directly facing Earth to the lunar south pole. (See also Earth&#x27;s prime meridian.) This can be thought of as the midpoint of the visible Moon as seen from the Earth. The latitude gives the position north or south of the lunar equator. Both of these coordinates are given in degrees.

Astronomers defined the fundamental location in the selenographic coordinate system by the small, bowl-shaped satellite crater &#x27;Mösting A&#x27;. The coordinates of this crater are defined as:

Later, the coordinate system has become more precisely defined due to the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment.

Anything past 90°E or 90°W would not be seen from Earth, except for libration, which makes 59% of the Moon visible.

== Longitude ==

Longitude on the Moon is measured both east and west from its prime meridian. When no direction is specified, east is positive and west is negative.

Roughly speaking, the Moon&#x27;s prime meridian lies near the center of the Moon&#x27;s disc as seen from Earth. For precise applications, many coordinate systems have been defined for the Moon, each with a slightly different prime meridian. The IAU recommends the &quot;mean Earth/polar axis&quot; system, in which the prime meridian is the average direction (from the Moon&#x27;s center) of the Earth&#x27;s center.

== Selenographic colongitude ==

The selenographic colongitude is the longitude of the morning terminator on the Moon, as measured in degrees westward from the prime meridian. The morning terminator forms a half-circle across the Moon where the Sun is just starting to rise. As the Moon continues in its orbit, this line advances in longitude. The value of the selenographic colongitude increases from 0° to 359° in the direction of the advancing terminator.

Sunrise occurs at the prime meridian when the Lunar phase reaches First Quarter, after one fourth of a lunar day. At this location the selenographic colongitude at sunrise is defined as 0°. Thus, by the time of the Full Moon the colongitude increases to 90°; at Last Quarter it is 180°, and at the New Moon the colongitude reaches 270°. Note that the Moon is nearly invisible from the Earth at New Moon phase except during a solar eclipse.

The low angle of incidence of arriving sunlight tends to pick out features by the sharp shadows they cast, thus the area near the terminator is usually the most favorable for viewing or photographing lunar features through a telescope. The observer will need to know the location of the terminator to plan observations of selected features. The selenographic colongitude is useful for this purpose.

The selenographic longitude of the evening terminator is equal to the colongitude plus 180°.

<doc id="875369" wikidata="Q7493533" url="?curid=875369" title="Sheldon Museum of Art">
<text>The Sheldon Museum of Art is an art museum in the city of Lincoln, in the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. 

Previously called the University of Nebraska Art Galleries and later the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, the institution was renamed to Sheldon Museum of Art in 2008. Its collection was initially housed in various university locations before moving to a dedicated building in 1963, on the city campus of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, designed by architect Philip Johnson. The building, funded by Frances Sheldon and A. Bromley Sheldon, is made of Roman travertine and features a grand hall, a distinctive staircase, and an installation by Isamu Noguchi.

Its collection focuses on 19th- and 20th-century art and the Sheldon houses over 12,000 artworks spanning multiple American art movements. The museum also encompasses an outdoor sculpture garden features more than 30 large-scale works by American modern and contemporary artists.

==History==
===Sheldon Art Association===
In 1888, The Sheldon Art Association was founded as the Haydon Art Club. It got its name in honor of the British painter, Benjamin Robert Haydon. The Haydon Art Club held an annual art exhibit and supplied art education to the university. In the early 1900s, the club underwent a reorganization and was incorporated under its new name, the Nebraska Art Association.

The Sheldon Art Association is a non-profit organization that has over 500 members.

===Sheldon Museum of Art===
The Sheldon Museum of Art was initially known as the University of Nebraska Art Galleries, and was then formerly known as Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery. The museum&#x27;s name was changed in 2008, along with the support organization that supports the museum, which is now known as the Sheldon Art Association, formerly the Nebraska Art Association.

==Building==
The museum exhibited its collection in locations around the university, including Morrill Hall, until a dedicated building was completed in 1963. Located at the junction of 12th and R Streets, on the city campus of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the Sheldon was designed by architect Philip Johnson and is a U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The building&#x27;s other distinctive features are a great hall with golden disks suspended from the ceiling, a spacious Great Hall, and a bridge-type grand staircase.

In 1959, Phillip Johnson proclaimed the Sheldon as the best building he had ever designed. As part of Johnson&#x27;s artist statement, he said of the Sheldon “[T]oday the museum building stands as a community like the church courthouse of the last century. The architect must therefore create, inside and out, a symbolic structure which the community can refer to with some pride … The symbolic function of the Sheldon Gallery is fulfilled, I feel, not only the ‘classical’ exterior of travertine but mainly by the great hall which orients the visitor, as well as elevating his spirits.” The museum was designed with the idea of avoiding what he referred to as “museum fatigue”. This is the idea that visitors to museums often feel alienated from the museum environment. This is a result of the freedom which he was given to him by the art association and its first director, Norman Geske.

The building was funded by a gift of Frances Sheldon and her brother A. Bromley Sheldon. The building was funded by two bequests by Frances Sheldon of $921,660 and her brother, A. Bromley Sheldon or $675,000. The Sheldon family owned a number of farms and a lumber yard in Lexington, Nebraska. The building features Roman travertine, which is a type of limestone. For many decades one of the key features of the great hall was an installation by Japanese-American sculptor, Isamu Noguchi, called “Song of the Bird.” He was invited to create and install a work as part of the building&#x27;s opening ceremonies in May 1963.

==Leadership==
* 1956-1993: Norman Geske
* 1983-1999: George Neubert
* 2001-2008: Janice Driesbach
* 2008-2014: Jorge Daniel Veneciano
* 2014-2023: Wally Mason
* 2023-present: Susan Longhenry

In 1956, Norman Geske was the first director of the Sheldon Museum of Art, and is widely credited with establishing the Sheldon&#x27;s modern art collection, as well as other regional cultural programs and institutions like Interstate 80 Bicentennial Sculpture Project, the Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney and the Mary Riepma Ross Media Arts Center, originally known as the Sheldon Film Theater.

In 2014, Wally Mason, the former director and chief curator at Haggerty Museum of Art from Marquette University in Milwaukee, became director of the Sheldon.

==Collections==
The Sheldon houses both the Sheldon Art Association collection (founded in 1888 as the Haydon Art Club), and the University of Nebraska collection, initiated in 1929. Together they comprise more than 12,000 works of art in all media. This comprehensive collection of American art includes prominent holdings of 19th-century landscape and still life, American Impressionism, early Modernism, Geometric abstraction, Abstract Expressionism, Pop art, Lyrical Abstraction, Color Field painting, Minimalism and Contemporary Art. In April 1965, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, a painting by Benjamin West was stolen and recovered by the FBI. Charged in the incident was a student from the University of Nebraska.

===Sculpture garden===
In the sculpture garden, more than 30 monumental sculptures are exhibited year-round. Among them are works by Gaston Lachaise, Jacques Lipchitz, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, David Smith, Lyman Kipp, William G. Tucker, Bryan Hunt, Mark di Suvero, Michael Heizer, and Richard Serra. When the sculpture garden&#x27;s first installations occurred, they were sometimes controversial. A woman once called a secretary and complained “I think Norman Geske should be fired, and what&#x27;s more, he should be asked to leave the state because of all the junk he&#x27;s introduced into the sunken garden south of the gallery.

In 1998, &quot;Man in the Open Air&quot;, a 1915 bronze sculpture by Elie Nadelman, was stolen from the sculpture garden. Police speculated that it had been taken in the course of post-game revelry following the university football team&#x27;s victory in the 1998 Orange Bowl. About a week later, it was recovered on the university&#x27;s East Campus. The gallery&#x27;s director hypothesized that the thief or thieves had been unaware of the work&#x27;s value, estimated at over $500,000, and, after learning this, had placed it where it would be discovered by security guards during their rounds. Following $15,000 in restoration and repair, the sculpture was put on display inside the building.

==Exhibitions==
The Sheldon&#x27;s exhibition program comprises approximately 20 exhibitions per year and focuses on American art in all media. The curatorial staff organizes exhibitions drawn from the permanent collection, many of which circulate nationally. The program also includes exhibitions organized by peer institutions throughout the United States. Educational programs such as symposia, lectures, children&#x27;s workshops and tours are organized in conjunction with each exhibition.

<doc id="875372" wikidata="Q413293" url="?curid=875372" title="Pyrolusite">
<text>Pyrolusite is a mineral consisting essentially of manganese dioxide (MnO2) and is important as an ore of manganese. It is a black, amorphous appearing mineral, often with a granular, fibrous, or columnar structure, sometimes forming crusts. It has a metallic luster, a black or bluish-black streak, and readily soils the fingers. The specific gravity is about 4.8. Its name is from the Greek for &quot;fire&quot; and to &quot;wash&quot;, in reference to its use as a way to remove tints from glass.
==Occurrence==

Pyrolusite and romanechite are among the most common manganese minerals. 
Pyrolusite occurs associated with manganite, hollandite, hausmannite, braunite, cryptomelane, chalcophanite, goethite, and hematite under oxidizing conditions in hydrothermal deposits. It also occurs in bogs and often results from alteration of manganite.

==Use==
The metal is obtained by reduction of the oxide with sodium, magnesium, aluminium, or by electrolysis. Pyrolusite is extensively used for the manufacture of spiegeleisen and ferromanganese and of various alloys such as manganese-bronze. As an oxidizing agent it is used in the preparation of chlorine; indeed, chlorine gas itself was first described by Karl Scheele in 1774 from the reaction products of pyrolusite and hydrochloric acid. Natural pyrolusite has been used in batteries, but high-quality batteries require synthetic products. Pyrolusite is also used to prepare disinfectants (permanganates) and for decolorizing glass. When mixed with molten glass it oxidizes the ferrous iron to ferric iron, and so discharges the green and brown tints (making it classically useful to glassmakers as a decolorizer). As a coloring material, it is used in calico printing and dyeing; for imparting violet, amber, and black colors to glass, pottery, and bricks; and in the manufacture of green and violet paints.

==Dendritic manganese oxides==
Black, manganese oxides with a dendritic crystal habit often found on fracture or rock surfaces are often assumed to be pyrolusite although careful analyses of numerous examples of these dendrites has shown that none of them are, in fact, pyrolusite. Instead, they are other forms of manganese oxide.

==History==
Some of the most famous early cave paintings in Europe were executed by means of manganese dioxide. Blocks of pyrolusite are found often at Neanderthal sites. It may have been kept as a pigment for cave paintings, but it has also been suggested that it was powdered and mixed with tinder fungus for lighting fires. Manganese dioxide, in the form of umber, was one of the earliest natural substances used by human ancestors. It was used as a pigment at least from the Middle Paleolithic. It may have been also used by the Neanderthals in fire-making.

The ancient Greeks had a term μάγνης or Μάγνης λίθος (&quot;Magnes lithos&quot;) meaning stone of the area called Μαγνησία (Magnesia), referring to Magnesia in Thessaly or to areas in Asia Minor with that name. Two minerals are called μάγνης, namely lodestone and pyrolusite (manganese dioxide).(not to be confused with the current mineral called Lodestone, which does not contain Manganese. Lodestone is a naturally magnetized form of the iron mineral Magnetite. FeFe2O4)
The term μαγνησία was used for manganese dioxide. In the sixteenth century it was called &quot;manganesum&quot;. It also was called Alabandicus (from the Alabanda region of Asia Minor) and Braunstein. Eventually the name of the element manganese was derived from &quot;manganesum&quot;, whereas &quot;magnesia&quot; came to mean the oxide of a different element, magnesium.

<text>New Life Churches, formerly known as New Life Churches International, is a Pentecostal Christian church movement in New Zealand. 

==History==
Early influences date from the 1940s when a series of meetings conducted by overseas &#x27;Bethel Temple&#x27; missionaries resulted in the planting of congregations in New Zealand and Australia. Some of its early leaders, among them Peter Morrow, attended a Bible college in Sydney in 1951. Further evangelistic campaigns and training occurred after 1957 and throughout the 1960s. In 1960, meetings began in Timaru that led to the establishment of Timaru New Life Centre. Also, many evangelistic campaigns took place throughout New Zealand. The first missionaries were sent overseas in this period. Peter Morrow began work in Christchurch in 1962 as the pastor of the church there, which was then known as the Christchurch Revival Fellowship. By 1964, thirteen &quot;indigenous&quot; churches had been established in the South Island. A number of congregations were planted in the North Island over the same period. Bible schools were established in Tauranga, Auckland and Christchurch. In 1975, Auckland pastor Shaun Kearney (an associate of the then ICNZ) was influential in setting up the Associated Pentecostal Churches of New Zealand, a pan-Pentecostal fellowship of church groups. In 1978 the Christchurch Revival Fellowship renamed itself the New Life Centre Christchurch, later becoming City New Life Church and now known as Majestic Church. This church functioned as the administrative offices of the New Life Centers of New Zealand for many years in the late 1980s and 1990s but is now an independent fellowship having left the New Life Churches movement. In 1987, twenty associate pastors of ICNZ left the renamed New Life Churches group, in reluctance to embrace the new governmental structure chosen at the 1987 ICNZ conference. These pastors eventually formed a new association named South Pacific Fellowship, and endeavored to maintain the less structured fellowship they had known prior to 1987. The name &#x27;New Life Churches&#x27; was adopted during the 1988 ICNZ Conference and a structure of national governance, including elected apostles and regional leaders, was agreed upon. The first apostles chosen by the 1987 conference were Rob Wheeler, a New Zealand Evangelist and Peter Morrow, an Australian evangelist. Both these men had been leading figures in the former ICNZ, and pioneers in spreading the Latter Rain Revival in New Zealand. Many member churches became involved heavily in social conservative political activism against the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1984, the establishment of Lyndhurst Hospital (a free-standing abortion clinic) in Christchurch, and passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act in 1986. They had also earlier been involved in the establishment of the Coalition of Concerned Citizens in 1974 and the Save Our Homes Campaign in 1977. The New Life Churches are now an international movement with affiliates in Australia, Asia and the Pacific. In keeping with Pentecostal Congregationalist philosophy, individual churches in the NLCNZ are autonomous and not governed by the central organization.

<text>A beer garden (German: &quot;Biergarten&quot;) is an outdoor area in which beer and food are served, typically at shared tables shaded by trees.

Beer gardens originated in Bavaria, of which Munich is the capital city, in the 19th century, and remain common in Southern Germany. They are usually attached to a brewery, beer hall, pub, or restaurant.

==History==
Facilities of this kind existed for example in Bamberg since 1605 under the German term &quot;Bierkeller&quot; (&quot;Beer cellars&quot;). At that time, the Archdiocese of Bamberg was directly subordinated to Rome and not yet to the Duchy of Bavaria. Hence, the first &quot;Biergarten&quot; in the strict sense of the term and of the decree of 1812 by the Kingdom of Bavaria developed at the beginning of 19th century in Munich. While it is unknown which brewery was first, it was likely one of Munich&#x27;s big six: Löwenbräu, Hofbräuhaus, Augustinerbräu, Paulaner, Hacker-Pschorr and Spaten.

Seasonal limitations on when beer could be brewed were already in the Bavarian brewing regulations by 1539. In 1553, Albert V decreed a period from 29 September, the Feast of St. Michael, to 23 April, the Feast of Saint George, for its production. The cool seasons were chosen to minimize the risk of fire when boiling mashed grain into wort. Numerous conflagrations had occurred, which resulted in the prohibition of brewing during the summer months. In response, large breweries dug cellars in the banks of the River Isar to keep their beer cool during storage. &quot;Beer cellars&quot; for consuming beer on premises naturally followed.
To further reduce the cellar temperature during the warm seasons, 19th-century brewers layered gravel upon the cellars by the bluffs and planted horse-chestnut trees for their dense spreading canopies and shallow roots, which would not damage the cellars. Soon afterward, serving cool beer in a pleasant shaded setting emerged. Simple tables and benches were set up among the trees, creating the popular &quot;beer garden&quot; that is known today. Food service followed, aggrieving smaller breweries that found it difficult to compete, and they petitioned Maximilian I to forbid it. As a compromise, beer gardens allowed their patrons to bring their own food, which is still a common practice. Most beer gardens offer clothed tablesets, whose guests must buy food from the house. Those who bring their own food must use the bare table sets, unless—which is common—they bring their own cloth(s) also. With the advent of widespread lagering in the later 19th century, beer gardens grew more popular than ever.

Maximilian&#x27;s decree is no longer in force, and many beer gardens forbid victuals not sold through the establishment. Common Bavarian fare such as &quot;Radi&quot; (radish), &quot;Brezn&quot; (soft pretzel), &quot;Obatzda&quot; (cheese dip), &quot;halbes Hendl&quot; (half a grilled chicken), &quot;Hax&#x27;n&quot; (knuckle of pork), and &quot;Steckerlfisch&quot; (grilled fish) are often served. Equally important to the beer garden is an atmosphere of &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot;, conveying a feeling of warmth, friendliness, and belonging. Reinforced by shared tables, it is often accompanied by music, song, and fellowship among strangers.

That is so integral to beer garden culture that the &quot;Bayerische Biergartenverordnung&quot; (Bavarian Beer Garden Ordinance) of 1999 permits traditional tree shaded venues that allow their patrons to bring their own food to close later and exceed the noise limits that are otherwise in force. The term &quot;Biergarten&quot; is not otherwise restricted, and anyone can call any kind of open-air restaurant by that name, but purists distinguish between a &quot;Wirtsgarten&quot;, in which only the brewery&#x27;s food is sold (such as the outdoor tables at the Hofbräuhaus am Platzl), and a &quot;Biergarten&quot;, in which patrons may bring their own.

==Around the world==
The term &quot;beer garden&quot; (&quot;Biergarten&quot;) has become a generic term for open-air establishments where beer is served. Many countries have such establishments. The characteristics of a traditional beer garden include trees, wooden benches, a gravel bed, and freshly prepared meals. Some modern beer gardens use plastic chairs, fast food, and other variations of the traditional beer garden.

The largest traditional beer garden in the world is the Hirschgarten in Munich, which seats 8,000.

===Australia===
Australia has many beer gardens, typically as part of a pub, or often next to sports fields.

===Austria===
In Austria, the beer garden is called &quot;Gastgarten&quot; (guest garden).
They serve food such as &quot;ein Paar Würstel&quot; (a pair of the German &quot;Bratwurst&quot;) or &quot;Schweinebraten&quot; (German pot-roasted pork). When ordering beer, the choices are usually a &quot;Pfiff &quot; (), a &quot;Seidel&quot; (), or a &quot;Krügerl&quot; ().

=== Canada ===

Canada has traditionally lacked an outdoor eating culture conducive to beer gardens. Cold weather and biting insects are part of the reason. However, with increased urbanization during the 20th century, drinking at outdoor cafes and restaurant patios became more common. Such patios are usually attached to licensed establishments. They became particularly popular with smokers in the late 20th and early 21st century as smoking was prohibited in public indoor spaces, however as of such bans have been expanded in most jurisdictions to cover licensed patios as well.

Canadian alcohol laws generally forbid drinking in unlicensed public places, although in recent years such policies have been relaxed in some jurisdictions. In Canada, beer gardens are generally a segregated area attached to an event such as a concert or festival. They may be outdoors and/or indoors, depending on the season and other circumstances. Eligibility for the specific license needed to operate such an event varies by jurisdiction, and is often effectively limited to non-profit organizations.

Despite the name, most beer gardens in Canada today serve other alcoholic beverages as well. Beer gardens are very popular at large sporting events such as the Memorial Cup in hockey. It is usually illegal to remove alcohol from the area or bring in outside alcohol.

===Germany===
The words ‘beer garden’ derive from the German ‘Biergarten’, they are still a very common cultural aspect throughout Germany, where some of the world’s oldest breweries are still active. The majority of towns and even villages have at least one small beer garden. Larger cities will have many throughout its neighbourhoods, including some of the largest beer gardens in the world. The Hirschgarten restaurant in Munich is noted for its beer garden, which is possibly the largest in the world. It has seating for well over 8,000 people. The restaurant dates back to 1791.

Biergartens typically are of a particular local or regional brewery, meaning they serve only the beers of the brewery they are associated with.
The world’s oldest brewery, Weihenstephaner (estd. 1041) has its beer garden next to its brewing facility and the Technical University of Munich, where a brewmaster degree is offered.

In 2011, the world record for &#x27;The world&#x27;s longest beer garden&#x27; was set in Berlin by the Berlin Beer Festival, measuring long.

===Japan===
Beer gardens are popular in Japan. Many are located on the roofs of department stores and hotels.

===United Kingdom===

In Britain a beer garden is an open space which is attached to a pub. In the countryside they usually provide a surrounding view of the area; in towns and cities a beer garden is an open garden space. Pubs located along canals will usually have a canal-side beer garden. Many pubs compete throughout the year to be named &#x27;Britain&#x27;s best beer garden&#x27; in numerous awards. Some provide open air music, as well as food, beer and other drinks.

===United States===

In the United States, historically, beer gardens offered many pastimes besides just beer drinking. Some spots hosted shooting galleries, bowling alleys, and live classical music. People could come for entertainment and events, even if they did not want to partake in the drinking. Today, many beer gardens have outdoor games, as well as board games, available to patrons.

The Raleigh Beer Garden in Raleigh, North Carolina holds the world record for largest selection of beer at a single location with 378 different beers on tap.

American liquor laws condition how beer gardens can operate in each state (legal drinking age is 21). For example, Washington alcohol laws require organizers to apply for and receive a liquor license, alcohol only to be consumed in the designated venue, the area to be fenced, and staff to &quot;cut off&quot; obviously drunk patrons. Additional laws restrict alcohol-related signage associated with the event and prevent smoking in the beer garden.

<doc id="875392" wikidata="Q3175136" url="?curid=875392" title="Project Gotham Racing 2">
<text>Project Gotham Racing 2 is a 2003 arcade-style racing video game developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released exclusively for the Xbox in November 2003 as the successor to 2001&#x27;s &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;.

Development began shortly after the completion of the first game and was first made official in August 2002. Bill Gates himself had emailed suggestions to the developer team of what he wished to see in it. The Kudos system, challenges set, available cars, and the tracks around which players race were expanded greatly from the original. The Kudos system was made to be slightly more forgiving than before and expanded to include new moves like drafting a rival or performing a 360. Alongside the 10 new real-world cities (and the Nürburgring) track, two additional packs were released as DLC. Online multiplayer via Xbox Live was also supported. In line with other online-enabled games on the Xbox, multiplayer on Xbox Live was available to players until 15 April 2010. &quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot; is now playable online again on the replacement Xbox Live servers called Insignia. 

&quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot; was critically acclaimed and is often considered one of the Xbox&#x27;s greatest exclusive titles. It was followed up by &quot;Project Gotham Racing 3&quot; in 2005.

== Gameplay ==

As with its predecessor, the route to advancement in &quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot; differs from most racing games, requiring a combination of driving fast enough to meet the challenge set, and scoring enough Kudos points to advance. Binning the previous cities, the game features Hong Kong, Barcelona, Moscow, Edinburgh, Washington DC, Chicago, Florence, Sydney, Yokohama, Stockholm and Nurburgring, designed to be as close as possible to real-life. There are over 120 cars available. Despite a significant upgrade in visuals, the game runs at half (30) the framerate of the original game.

=== Single-player ===
There are four main parts to the single player game: Kudos World Series, Arcade Racing and Time Attack.

In Kudos World Series the player has to complete a series of races in 14 different categories of car. The player begins with just three cars in the Compact Sports Series and eventually can have access to 102 cars (118 cars after purchase of the downloadable content). Most cars can be bought in exchange for kudos tokens, although some can only be obtained by completing enough races at a high level. Each car is made from around 10,000 polygons and was recorded with eight microphones in order to accurately replicate engine, turbo, exhaust, and transmission sound in-game.

In Arcade Racing there are 60 medals available, with 20 medals each for street racing, timed runs and cone challenges. Each race is with a preset car and track. Time Attack does not use kudos; the aim is for the player to try to get round the circuits as fast as possible. The player can either choose circuit or car challenges. In circuit challenge the player can choose from a selection of up to 92 circuits and then choose any car to race in. In car challenge the player can choose from a selection of up to 102 cars and race on a predetermined circuit. In both styles circuits and cars may only be chosen if they have previously been unlocked in kudos world series or arcade racing. If the player enters the showroom, it can view and test drive all cars on a test track. The players can also race against a ghost car that got the record time.

Challenges are divided into five difficulties: Steel (novice), Bronze (easy), Silver (medium), Gold (hard), and Platinum (expert).

=== Online ===
Unlike many other Xbox Live enabled games, &quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot;″s online ranking system was solely based on the kudos earned online. One can not go down in rank, only up. In this way, one&#x27;s rank does not necessarily reflect their skill.

=== &quot;Geometry Wars&quot; ===
Within the player&#x27;s car garage, an arcade cabinet can be interacted with to play the classic minigame &quot;Geometry Wars&quot;, a top-down multidirectional shooter. This marked the first appearance to the public of what would become an entire series of similar games.

== Downloadable content ==
Microsoft released two downloadable content packages for &quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot;: the Paris Booster Pack (released in May 2004), featuring eight new cars and seven tracks in Paris, France, and the Long Beach Booster Pack (released in June 2004) with eight new cars and eight tracks based around Long Beach, California, United States.

== Reception ==

&quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to video game review aggregator Metacritic In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40, while &quot;Famitsu Xbox&quot; gave it one ten, one nine, one eight, and one seven, for a total of 34 out of 40.

During the AIAS&#x27; 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Console Racing Game of the Year&quot;.

<doc id="875405" wikidata="Q409096" url="?curid=875405" title="Scheelite">
<text>Scheelite is a calcium tungstate mineral with the chemical formula CaWO4. It is an important ore of tungsten (wolfram). Scheelite is originally named after Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1742–1786). Well-formed crystals are sought by collectors and are occasionally fashioned into gemstones when suitably free of flaws. Scheelite has been synthesized using the Czochralski process; the material produced may be used to imitate diamond, as a scintillator, or as a solid-state lasing medium. It was also used in radium paint in the same fashion as was zinc sulphide, and Thomas Edison invented a fluoroscope with a calcium tungstate-coated screen, making the images six times brighter than those with barium platinocyanide; the latter chemical allowed Röntgen to discover X-rays in early November 1895. Note, the semi-precious stone marketed as &#x27;blue scheelite&#x27; is actually a rock type consisting mostly of calcite and dolomite, with occasional traces of yellow-orange scheelite.

== Properties ==

Its crystals are in the tetragonal crystal system, appearing as dipyramidal pseudo-octahedra. Colors include golden yellow, brownish green to dark brown, pinkish to reddish gray, orange and colorless. Transparency ranges from translucent to transparent and crystal faces are highly lustrous (vitreous to adamantine). Scheelite possesses distinct cleavage and its fracture may be subconchoidal to uneven. Its specific gravity is high at 5.9–6.1 and its hardness is low at 4.5–5. Aside from pseudo-octahedra, scheelite may be columnar, granular, tabular or massive in habit. Druzes are quite rare and occur almost exclusively at Zinnwald, Czech Republic. Twinning is also commonly observed and crystal faces may be striated. Scheelite streaks white and is brittle.

Gems cut from transparent material are fragile. Scheelite&#x27;s refractive index (1.918–1.937 uniaxial positive, with a maximum birefringence of 0.016) and dispersion (0.026) are both moderately high. These factors combine to result in scheelite&#x27;s high lustre and perceptible &quot;fire&quot;, approaching that of diamond.

Scheelite fluoresces under shortwave ultraviolet light, the mineral glows a bright sky-blue. The presence of molybdenum trace impurities occasionally results in a green glow. Fluorescence of scheelite, sometimes associated with native gold, is used by geologists in the search for gold deposits.

== Occurrence ==
Scheelite occurs in contact metamorphic skarns; in high-temperature hydrothermal veins and greisen; less commonly in granite pegmatites. Temperature and pressure of formation is between and from . Typical mineral association includes cassiterite, wolframite, topaz, fluorite, apatite, tourmaline, quartz, grossular–andradite, diopside, vesuvianite and tremolite.

Scheelite usually occurs in tin-bearing veins; and is sometimes found in association with gold. Fine crystals have been obtained from Caldbeck Fells in Cumbria, Zinnwald/Cínovec and Elbogen in Bohemia, Guttannen in Switzerland, the Giant Mountains in Silesia, Dragoon Mountains in Arizona and elsewhere. At Trumbull in Connecticut and Kimpu-san in Japan large crystals of scheelite completely altered to wolframite have been found: those from Japan have been called “reinite.” It was mined until 1990 at King Island, Australia, Glenorchy in Central Otago and Macraes Flat in North Otago and also at The Golden Bar mine at Dead Horse Creek during World War I in Nelson, New Zealand. There is a high concentration of Scheelite in Northeast of Brazil, mainly in the Currais Novos mine in Rio Grande do Norte State. One of the world&#x27;s largest Scheelite mining companies is in Luoyang, China.

Scheelite was first described in 1751 for an occurrence in &quot;Mount Bispbergs klack&quot;, Säter, Dalarna, Sweden, and named for Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1742–1786). Owing to its unusual heaviness, it had been given the name &quot;tungsten&quot; by the Swedes, meaning “heavy stone.” The name was later used to describe the metal, while the ore itself was given the name scheelerz or scheelite.

== Synthetics ==

Although it is now uncommon as a diamond imitation (much more convincing products, like cubic zirconia and moissanite have long since superseded it), synthetic scheelite is occasionally offered as natural scheelite, and collectors may thus be fooled into paying high prices for them. Gemologists distinguish natural scheelite from synthetic material mainly by microscopic examination: Natural material is very seldom without internal growth features and inclusions (imperfections), while synthetic material is usually very clean. Distinctly artificial curved striae and clouds of minute gas bubbles may also be observed in synthetic scheelite.

The visible absorption spectrum of scheelite, as seen by a hand-held (direct-vision) spectroscope, may also be of use: most natural stones show a number of faint absorption lines in the yellow region of the spectrum (~585 nm) due to praseodymium and neodymium trace impurities. Conversely, synthetic scheelite is often without such a spectrum. Some synthetics may however be doped with neodymium or other rare-earth elements, but the spectrum produced is unlike that of natural stones.

== Applications ==
Scheelite is widely used in phosphors, particularly in scintillators for X-ray and gamma-ray detection. It is also utilized in fluorescent lighting systems for its ability to convert ultraviolet light into visible light. In some cathode ray tubes (CRTs), calcium tungstate (Scheelite) is used as a phosphorescent screen material.

== In popular culture ==
Scheelite figures in the manga series &quot;Dr. Stone&quot;, as a precursor to tungsten, and for its fluorescence.

<text>A wheelwright is a craftsman who builds or repairs wooden wheels. The word is the combination of &quot;wheel&quot; and the word &quot;wright&quot; (which comes from the Old English word &quot;wryhta&quot;, meaning a worker or shaper of wood) as in shipwright and arkwright. This occupational name became the English surname &quot;Wright&quot;. It also appears in surnames like &quot;Cartwright&quot; and &quot;Wainwright&quot;. It corresponds with skilful metal workers being called &quot;Smith.&quot;

These tradesmen made wheels for carts (cartwheels), wagons (wains), traps and coaches and the belt drives of steam powered machinery. They also made the wheels, and often the frames, for spinning wheels. First constructing the hub (called the nave), the spokes and the rim segments called felloes, (pronounced fell low), and assembling them all into a unit working from the center of the wheel outwards. Most wheels were made from wood, but other materials have been used, such as bone and horn, for decorative or other purposes. Some earlier construction for wheels such as those used in early chariots were bound by rawhide that would be applied wet and would shrink whilst drying, compressing and binding the woodwork together. After many centuries wheels evolved to be straked with iron, a method of nailing iron plates onto the felloes to protect against wear on the ground and to help bind the wheel together. Straking was considered to be a less skilled practice and could be done with less knowledge and equipment, this made the wheels easier to service without the need for a blacksmith.

Over millennia the overall appearance of the wheel barely changed but subtle changes to the design such as dishing and staggered spokes helped keep up with the demands of a changing world. These small changes in design made a massive improvement to the strength of the wheel whilst reducing its weight; vehicles then became more efficient to build and use.

== History ==

Early wooden wheels were solid, made from slabs of trees. They were heavy but the simple construction did not requiring much skill. Wheels with spokes were lighter. They could be constructed with smaller trees and built larger in diameter because they were not limited by the size of trees in the region. However, spoked wheels required precise spacing and careful calculations to construct a perfect circle. It is thought that the special craft of wheelwright started with the invention of the spoke. Rural areas without access to a wheelwright continued to make solid wheels.

Due to the skill and experience required for making wheels, in Europe the wheelwright was formed into an identifiable trade.

== Parts of a wheel ==
The basic parts of a wooden wheel are nave (or hub), spokes, felloes (felly) and tyre (tire).

The nave is the central block of the wheel. In a wooden-spoked wheel, the nave acts as the hub. One end of each spoke is set into the nave in a process called tennoning. In older wheels, the nave had a 6-inch sleeve that fit over the axle to keep the wheel from wobbling; it required frequent greasing. More modern carriage wheels use bearings.

Spokes are wooden sticks that fit into the nave at one end, and into the felloe at the other end.

A felloe is one of several curved pieces of wood that when pieced together make the rim of a wheel. They are fitted onto the outer ends of the spokes. Sometimes spelled &quot;felly&quot;. The number of felloes required to make a circle varied by region, era and size of wheel—with a minimum of two half-circles of bent wood, to multiple felloes per wheel with at least two spokes per felloe.

The rim is the outer edge of a wheel, although some refer to the tyre as rim.

The tyre or tire is a protective strip that goes outside the felloes. Tyres were make of iron or steel, usually as a hoop and fitted hot around the rim. As it cooled and shrank it tightened the joints of the spokes-to-felloes and spokes-to-nave, strengthening the wheel and making it more rigid. Metal tyres are very noisy on hard road surfaces, so many carriages wheels were made with solid rubber tyres fitted into a metal channel.

Due to age or dry climate, a wheel would shrink and the metal hoop tyre would become loose. Routinely, the hoop would be removed, &#x27;shrunk&#x27;, heated and refitted to make the wheel tight again. Tools to shrink the hoops were called &quot;tire upsetters&quot; or &quot;tire shrinkers&quot;.

== Industrial age ==
During the industrial age, iron strakes were replaced by a solid iron tyre custom made by a blacksmith after the wheelwright had measured each wheel to ensure proper fit. Iron tyres were always made slightly smaller than the wheel in circumference. They were expanded by heating in a fire, and while hot they were hammered, and pulled by a levered hook, onto the rim of the wheel. The hot tyre was then cooled by placing it into water. This shrank it onto the wood, and closed the wooden joints. Tyres were fastened to the wheels with nails, or tyre bolts. The metal tyres were drilled before being placed on the wheel. Tyre-bolts were less likely than tyre-nails to fall off because they were bolted through the felloes. Both countersunk and flush finished to the wheel&#x27;s outer surface.
During the second half of the 19th century, the use of pre-manufactured iron hubs and other factory-made wood, iron and rubber wheel parts became increasingly common. Companies such as Henry Ford&#x27;s developed manufacturing processes that soon made the village wheelwright obsolete. With the onset of two world wars, the trade soon went into decline and was very rare by the 1960s and almost extinct by the year 2000. However, owing to the efforts of organisations like the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, wheelwrights still continue to operate in the UK.

In modern times, wheelwrights continue to make and repair a wide variety of wheels, including those made from wood and banded by iron tyres. The word &quot;wheelwright&quot; remains a term usually used for someone who makes and repairs wheels for horse-drawn vehicles, although it is sometimes used to refer to someone who repairs wheels, wheel alignment, rims, drums, discs and wire spokes on modern vehicles such as automobiles, buses and trucks. Wheels for horse-drawn vehicles continue to be constructed and repaired for use by people who use such vehicles for farming, competitions and presentations of historical events such as reenactments and living history.

== Wheelwrighting today ==
A modern wooden wheel generally consists of three main parts, the &quot;nave&quot; or hub at the centre of the wheel, the spokes radiating out from the centre and the &quot;felloes&quot; or rims around the outside. Generally the wheel would be bound by a steel or iron tyre depending on its historical period and purpose.

The main timbers used in a traditional wooden wheel are Elm for the nave, Oak for the spokes and Ash for the felloes although this can vary in some areas depending on availability of timber, climate and style of production. Sometimes Hickory is substituted for Oak and Ash as it is easier to bend for mass production and is quite springy for light wheels that require a bit of flexibility.

The Elm is used for its interwoven grain, this prevents the nave from splitting with the force of the spokes being driven in tight.

The Oak is used because it doesn&#x27;t bend, compress or flex and transfers any load pressures directly from the felloes to the nave.

The Ash is used for its flexibility and springy nature, this acts as a form of suspension and protects against shock damage.

== The future ==
In the second half of the 20th century, wheelwright training faded away due to a lack of demand for new wooden wheels. The skills were kept alive by small businesses, museums, societies and trusts such as The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (USA) and The Countryside Agency (UK).

The Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights in London (UK) maintains a flourishing (government-backed) apprenticeship scheme that began in 2013.

Colonial Williamsburg (USA) has an ongoing apprenticeship program and has recently (2016) taken on new apprentices.

<text>The IBM System/3 was an IBM midrange computer introduced in 1969, and marketed until 1985. It was produced by IBM Rochester in Minnesota as a low-end business computer aimed at smaller organizations that still used IBM 1400 series computers or unit record equipment. The first member of what IBM refers to as their &quot;midrange&quot; line, it also introduced the RPG II programming language. It is the first ancestor in the product line whose current version is the IBM i series and includes the highly successful AS/400.

==History==

At its launch in 1969 it was available for $1000/month — less than half cost of an IBM System/360 Model 20; the smallest member of the IBM System/360 family.

Many of the original System/3 model 10 units were shipped diskless, with only the new IBM 5424 Multifunction Card Unit (MFCU) which read, punched, printed on and sorted the new, smaller 96-column punched cards introduced at the same time.

IBM delivered the following models:
* 1969 — IBM 5410, or System/3 Model 10, introduced (shipped in 1970)
* 1970 — IBM 5406, or System/3 Model 6, introduced (disk-oriented system)
* 1973 — IBM 5415, or System/3 Model 15, introduced
* 1974 — IBM 5408, or System/3 Model 8, introduced
* 1975 — IBM 5412, or System/3 Model 12, introduced
* 1976 — IBM 5404, or System/3 Model 4, introduced

The System/3 and successor models System/32, System/34, System/36 and System/38 are generally referred to in IBM terminology as &quot;midrange systems&quot; — in contrast to IBM&#x27;s mainframes.

==Hardware==

The IBM System/3 was announced as a computer system that initially consisted of:

* IBM 5410 Model 10 Central Processing Unit
* IBM 5424 Multi Functional Card Unit (MFCU)
* IBM 5203 Line Printer
* IBM 5444 Disk Storage (optional)
* IBM 5471 Printer Keyboard
* IBM 5475 Data Entry Keyboard
* IBM 5496 Data Recorder, a keypunch machine with print and verify functions
* IBM 5486 Card Sorter

===Memory===
Entry models had as little as 4K (4096) bytes of magnetic-core memory.

===Direct access storage===

For mass storage, the System/3 used the IBM 5444 single-platter disk, roughly the size of a large pizza; initially each platter held 2.5 MB of data. Standard configuration for storage was one or two fixed disks, each in a separate pull-out drawer, which typically held the operating system and user-developed programs. Additionally, each fixed disc could have a removable cartridge disk attached; these typically contained the data-files associated with various applications, for example Payroll, and users frequently had a number of them. Thus the low-end systems could support a maximum of 10 MB of online storage (two fixed, two removable), although in practice this was very expensive and not common.

The System/3 was also available with the IBM 5445 disk drive (20mb) and later the model 15 allowed &quot;winchester&quot; style 3340 drives. On the smaller models, while you could attach 5445 drives, you had to keep the 5444 for the operating system and other programming libraries, however that limitation was changed with software called elimn8 which allowed 5445 drives to totally replace the 5444&#x27;s. Other companies such as Memorex manufactured compatible 5445 drives for the System/3.

===Multi-Function Card Unit===
The most common punched-card device was IBM 5424 Multifunction Card Unit (MFCU) which read, punched, printed on and sorted the new, smaller 96-column punched cards. Instead of the rectangular punches in the classic 80-column IBM card, the new cards had tiny (1 mm), circular holes much like paper tape. Data was stored in six-bit binary-coded decimal code, with three rows of 32 characters each, or in 8-bit EBCDIC, with the two extra holes located in the top rows.
The new cards had room for 128 printed characters in four rows of 32 characters each. They were about 1/3 the size of the older 80 column cards but held 20% more text data. The smaller, and thus lighter card could be processed with faster equipment and with fewer jams.

Available as &quot;RPQ&quot;s (special order equipment) to handle 80-column cards were the IBM 2560 Multifunction Card Machine (MFCM) which could read, punch, interpret and sort, and the IBM 1442 which could only read and punch.

===Magnetic tape===
Offline storage was available with the purchase of an external tape drive which read and wrote standard IBM 9-track tape.

The System/3 Mod 10 optionally included the IBM 3410 magnetic tape subsystem.

===Operator Console Facility===
The System/3 Operator Console Facility (OCF) consisted of either a modified IBM Selectric typewriter interfaced into the computer, or a special purpose IBM 3270 display.
Within the OCF, there was capability to &#x27;cancel&#x27; processes and/or tasks that were running, including either partition (P1 or P2). The system could only run two programs simultaneously, except for the model 15 or systems running the Communications Control program, CCP. The CCP was a system control programming feature that allowed to support an online network of terminals.

===Printers===

A smaller (IBM 5203) printer was attached to the main system. The 5203 was a chain printer with interchangeable cartridges. It could run at 100 or 200 lines per minute, based on model. Later on, IBM offered multiple models of the existing IBM 1403 printer line, which had been originally built for the IBM 1401 computer.

===Floppy disk===
With the arrival of the IBM 3740 data entry system, the System/3 Model 10 got a feature called LCA (local communication adaptor) which allowed an IBM 3741 station to be &quot;attached&quot; to the system to transmit/receive data. Later models of the System/3 such as the Model 8 were cardless and used the 8&quot; 3740 style floppy disk.

==Instruction set==
The instruction set was optimised for two key aspects of the product: limited availability of main memory, and the RPG II programming language. The original S/3 (models 10 and then 6, 8 and 12) had 29 instructions, all occupying between 3 and 6 bytes (24 to 48 bits).

The first 4 bits conveyed a lot of information: &quot;1111&quot; meant this was an instruction without operands, known as a command. e.g. Start I/O (the I/O op being defined by previously loaded I/O registers). &quot;11xx&quot; and &quot;xx11&quot; meant a 1-operand instruction, such as a Branch. If xx was 00 the operand was addressed by its full 16-bit address. xx=01 or 10 meant base-displacement addressing was used, using index register 1 or 2 respectively. A base address would previously have been loaded into one of the two index registers and the instruction contained the displacement of up to just 256 bytes (8 bits of addressing).

Other patterns for this first half-byte indicated a 2-operand instruction.
&quot;0000&quot; meant both operands were addressed by their direct 16-bit address.
&quot;0100&quot;: operand 1 uses reg 1 as its base; operand 2 uses direct addressing.
&quot;0110&quot;: operand 1 uses reg 1 as its base, operand 2 uses reg 2.
And so on.

The remaining 4 bits of the first byte further defined the instruction.
This structure meant that there was the capability to have up to 64 operations in all:
16 commands (though there were never more than five across the whole product range);
16 1-operand instructions starting with 11xx;
16 1-operand instructions starting with xx11;
16 2-operand instructions.

As well as the two index registers already mentioned (referred to as 1 and 2, or binary 01 and 10) there were other registers. &quot;Reg 4&quot; (0100) was the instruction address register (IAR) which pointed at the current instruction. &quot;Reg 8&quot; (1000) was the address recall register (ARR), set by certain instructions. Among these was the conditional branch (mnemonic BC) which used it to point to the byte immediately following the branch operation. For programmers used to IBM mainframe behaviour, this meant that the S/3 branch operation could be likened to a conditional BALR (branch and link register) – very useful when branching to a sub-routine, and returning after it had processed. Finally, &quot;Reg 16&quot; (00010000) was the program status register (PSR), holding such things as the results of a compare instruction. Note that registers were used only for addressing and program status, not for arithmetic.

The arithmetic instructions provided among the 29 instructions were binary add/subtract (provided to help manipulate addresses) and decimal add/subtract. Multiplication and division were not provided for by the standard hardware, and had to be handled by software routines. There was no floating point provision at all. All this continued to be true even with the later and generally more sophisticated Systems/34 and 36.

All the above got more complicated with the System/3 model 15, and the Systems/34 and /36. Though still using 16-bit addressing, all these systems could support well over 64K of main storage (up to 512K and theoretically more), so address translation was used to swap from one 64K address space to another. Address Translation Registers were set to define the actual address space in use at any one time, their contents being concatenated with the 16-bit address used by a program to produce a real address. These &quot;ATRs&quot; were privileged, available only to the operating system.

The original S/3 model 10 (and the later model 12) had an optional crude form of multi-programming called the Dual Program Feature. This provided no more main memory addressing, but gave two sets of registers and instructions which flipped from one &quot;program level&quot; to the other. The standard I/O instructions were also modified to flip when an I/O was started.

So far, only the first byte of the instruction has been explained here. The next (&quot;Q&quot;) byte was generally a qualifier, such as specifying the number of bytes to be moved in a move characters op or the condition to test for in a Branch. A couple of instructions used this byte for a 1-byte &quot;immediate&quot; operand. The remaining byte(s) were for the displacement(s) or address(es) for operands, or the details for some commands.

An example: a simple command, Conditional Jump, a special type of conditional branch (forward only, up to 256 bytes) suitable mainly for jumping over short blocks of code: Op code byte= F2 (this is in hexadecimal, Hex F is binary 1111, Hex 2 (0010) defines the op); Q byte= 00000001 specifies that we &quot;jump&quot; if the condition register has the &quot;equal&quot; bit on; Operand= 00011000: if the condition is met we jump forward 24 bytes.

Indicators were binary switches used to control program flow. Over 100 of these were available to the programmer. By using the instruction formats explained above, many of the indicator-oriented operations could be fit into just 3 bytes. For example, a line of RPG might test an indicator for &quot;On&quot;: 3 bytes for a &quot;Test Bits On&quot; op; then 3 bytes for a Jump, as previously described, and useful to the RPG compiler. Saving the odd byte here and there was good when you had only 64K to play with—and, on the S/3 itself, that had to include the operating system (which grew to about 20K on the model 10 with the introduction of the &quot;Communication Control Program&quot;, CCP).

==Operation Control Language==
A simple job control language called Operation Control Language (OCL) was superficially similar to the Job Control Language (JCL).

==Operator control commands==
Operator control commands (OCCs) were used to communicate with the system.

==Languages==
The System/3 supported RPG II, Fortran IV, COBOL, and &quot;Assembler&quot;.

===RPG II compiler===
The System/3 came standard with a RPG II compiler. In a card-only system, the RPG II compiler was supplied as two phases. The first phase would be booted from one input hopper of the MFCU, and the source would then be read following the compiler. An intermediate form was punched on cards, which were then read by the second phase of the compiler. An executable program deck was then punched. This executable could then be booted (&quot;IPL&#x27;ed&quot;, for &quot;Initial Program Load&quot;) to perform the processing desired. This process could require more than an hour for a significant-sized program.

==Problems with System/3==
The System/3 had no provision for halting a process once it had started to run. For instance, if a compile failed because of an error on the very first page, the user had to wait for a sometimes voluminous compile listing to print in its entirety. Users learned to reach under the printer and jostle the paper discharge chute, which would cause the machine to halt with a &quot;P3&quot; (printer error) displayed. The user could then dial in the response code FF to abort the run. Another way of stopping it was simply to press the green &quot;Start&quot; button on the console, causing the system to reboot.

Error codes were displayed on a two-digit seven-segment display (one of the first seen, and built with lamps rather than LEDs). The range of error codes included not only decimal and hexadecimal digits (as seven-segment displays are commonly used) but also a limited set of other letters; for example, &quot;P3&quot; was one of several printer error codes. A thick manual that came with the System/3 aided the operator in interpreting the error codes and suggested recovery procedures. The System/3 had no audible warning device, so a program that was not printing, reading cards, or causing other obvious activity could halt and the operator would not know it unless they happened to look at the status display. Models with the Dual Program Feature had two separate status displays.

Most/many users did not buy a console. Instead OCL code was either suppressed entirely or printed on the 5203 printer. The console offered by IBM slowed down program execution tremendously when it printed OCL commands, as it was basically a selectric typewriter.

The concept of keying your punched cards through the console was a marketing ploy. In reality, the System/3 could not be a computer and a keypunch at the same time, so when it was a keypunch, no computing was possible. The original IBM System/3, which was shown in July 1969, had the keypunch console so they could offer a computer for under $2,000/month. In reality it was unworkable and almost invariably users acquired a stand-alone keypunch/verifier.

Later several OEM companies built 96-column keypunches, sorters, and collators. This took the &#x27;heavy lifting&#x27; off of the MFCU and freed the System/3 for actual computing functions.

Most experienced System/3 users minimized use of the MFCU as much as possible, since it was a system bottleneck.

==Emulation==
The later System/32, IBM System/34 and IBM System/36 were all able to run System/3 applications through emulation.

The System/32 used a vertically microcoded processor, with 16-bit microcode words, which emulated the System/3 instruction set, rather slowly, in microcode. The System/34 and System/36 both had two processors: a Control Storage Processor (CSP), as in System/32, which handled most supervisor and input/output operations, and a Main Storage Processor (MSP). This latter was a re-implementation of the System/3 model 15 processor; effectively providing &quot;hardware emulation&quot; of the System/3.

<doc id="875418" wikidata="Q192669" url="?curid=875418" title="Siderite">
<text>Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO3). Its name comes from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning &quot;iron&quot;. A valuable iron ore, it consists of 48% iron and lacks sulfur and phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium, and manganese commonly substitute for the iron, resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite, and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series.

Siderite has Mohs hardness of 3.75 to 4.25, a specific gravity of 3.96, a white streak and a vitreous or pearly luster. Siderite is antiferromagnetic below its Néel temperature of which can assist in its identification.

It crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system; crystals are rhombohedral in shape, typically with curved and striated faces. It also occurs in masses. Color ranges from yellow to dark brown or black, the latter being due to the presence of manganese.

Siderite is commonly found in hydrothermal veins, and is associated with barite, fluorite, galena, and others. It is also a common diagenetic mineral in shales and sandstones, where it sometimes forms concretions, which can encase three-dimensionally preserved fossils. In sedimentary rocks, siderite commonly forms at shallow burial depths and its elemental composition is often related to the depositional environment of the enclosing sediments. In addition, a number of recent studies have used the oxygen isotopic composition of sphaerosiderite (a type associated with soils) as a proxy for the isotopic composition of meteoric water shortly after deposition.

== Carbonate iron ore ==
Although carbonate iron ores, such as siderite, have been economically important for steel production, they are far from ideal as an ore.

Their hydrothermal mineralisation tends to form them as small ore lenses, often following steeply dipping bedding planes. This makes them not amenable to opencast working, and increases the cost of working them by mining with horizontal stopes. As the individual ore bodies are small, it may also be necessary to duplicate or relocate the pit head machinery, winding engine and pumping engine, between these bodies as each is worked out. This makes mining the ore an expensive proposition compared to typical ironstone or haematite opencasts.

The recovered ore also has drawbacks. The carbonate ore is more difficult to smelt than a haematite or other oxide ore. Driving off the carbonate as carbon dioxide requires more energy and so the ore &#x27;kills&#x27; the blast furnace if added directly. Instead the ore must be given a preliminary roasting step. Developments of specific techniques to deal with these ores began in the early 19th century, largely with the work of Sir Thomas Lethbridge in Somerset. His &#x27;Iron Mill&#x27; of 1838 used a three-chambered concentric roasting furnace, before passing the ore to a separate reducing furnace for smelting. Details of this mill were the invention of Charles Sanderson, a steel maker of Sheffield, who held the patent for it.

These differences between spathic ore and haematite have led to the failure of a number of mining concerns, notably the Brendon Hills Iron Ore Company.

Spathic iron ores are rich in manganese and have negligible phosphorus. This led to their one major benefit, connected with the Bessemer steel-making process. Although the first demonstrations by Bessemer in 1856 were successful, others&#x27; initial attempts to replicate his method infamously failed to produce good steel. Work by the metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet showed that the reason for the discrepancy was the nature of the Swedish ores that Bessemer had innocently used; they were very low in phosphorus. Using a typical European high-phosphorus ore in Bessemer&#x27;s converter gave a poor quality steel. To produce high quality steel from a high-phosphorus ore, Mushet realised that he could operate the Bessemer converter for longer, burning off all the steel&#x27;s impurities including the unwanted phosphorus but also the carbon (which is an essential ingredient in steel), and then re-adding carbon, along with manganese, in the form of a previously obscure ferromanganese ore with no phosphorus, spiegeleisen. This created a sudden demand for spiegeleisen. Although it was not available in sufficient quantity as a mineral, steelworks such as that at Ebbw Vale in South Wales soon learned to make it from the spathic siderite ores. For a few decades, spathic ores were therefore in demand and this encouraged their mining. In time though, the original &#x27;acidic&#x27; liner of the Bessemer converter, made from siliceous sandstone or ganister, was replaced by a &#x27;basic&#x27; liner in the newer Gilchrist Thomas process. This removed the phosphorus impurities as slag produced by chemical reaction with the liner, and no longer required spiegeleisen. From the 1880s demand for the ores fell once again and many of their mines, including those of the Brendon Hills, closed soon after.

<text>Canadian Forces Station Debert (also CFS Debert) was a Canadian Forces station located in Debert, Nova Scotia. It was most recently used during the Cold War as a communications facility and was home to a &quot;Regional Emergency Government Headquarters&quot; (REGH) complex, more commonly known by the nickname &quot;Diefenbunker.&quot;

Originally this facility was developed with an airfield and army training centre, however these facilities were partly decommissioned in the 1970s and ownership of the airfield and some lands/buildings transferred to the Government of Nova Scotia to be operated as the Debert Air Industrial Park. Following decommissioning of the REGH and removal of the last military presence at CFS Debert in the 1996, the rest of the facility was transferred to the Government of Nova Scotia and then the Colchester Regional Development Authority to operate as Colchester Park.

==Debert Military Camp==

Following the outbreak of the Second World War in the fall of 1939, the first Canadian units began shipping through the port of Halifax; however the end of the Phoney War in the spring of 1940 required a massive ramp-up in Canada&#x27;s land forces in Europe. The sheer volume of soldiers who would be embarking through Halifax required staging facilities for training and marshalling combat units before embarking on the troopships.

To meet this requirement, the government announced that existing facilities at Camp Aldershot near Kentville, Nova Scotia and Camp Sussex near Sussex, New Brunswick would be upgraded to handle the requirements of housing and training brigade-size units. In spring of 1940, the government also began purchasing additional land in Debert for a division-size training and marshalling facility adjacent to those lands previously purchased in 1938 by the Royal Canadian Air Force for an aerodrome.

Located on the Montreal-Halifax main line of Canadian National Railways, the flat plain surrounding Debert Station were considered ideal for an army staging facility in addition to an aerodrome. The additional benefit that it was located only north of Halifax.

On August 9, 1940, the 6th Field Company Canadian Engineers arrived at the site and began work at clearing the forests and laying out what would become the Debert Military Camp (also referred to as Camp Debert). Employing 6,000 civilians and thousands more military members, the engineers cleared the trees and burnt the plain before building streets, sewer and water services, electricity, and buildings over an area of . The camp was bisected with named avenues and numbered streets having innumerable quonset huts, mess halls, warehouses, canteens, and other buildings. At one point during its construction period, the camp housed more troops than the population of neighbouring Truro at the time.

The surrounding community of Debert grew rapidly with movie houses, restaurants, bars and other businesses being set up and the economic effects spilling over into Truro.

Camp Debert was the final staging area for units embarking from Halifax and was the location where the majority of troops received and trained with their personal weapons. For these purposes a large ammunition depot was built as well as extensive firing ranges. Component units arrived at Camp Debert from across Canada and were organized into larger formations before being carried by trains to troopships at Halifax, usually at night in black-out conditions.

All five divisions of the First Canadian Army were housed (all, or in part) at Camp Debert prior to departure for the European Theatre during the Second World War. In addition, the 7th Canadian Infantry Division of Atlantic Command was formed at Camp Debert, although its volunteer troops went overseas as reinforcements rather than an intact combat unit.

Following the war, Camp Debert was used in the repatriation of troops returning from Europe before undergoing significant downsizing with the majority of training and marshalling areas being decommissioned. In 1948, Camp Debert was reactivated and hosted several active army units during the 1950s.

==RCAF Station Debert==

In the fall of 1938 the Royal Air Force (RAF) purchased land for constructing an aerodrome on the north shore of Cobequid Bay near the farming community of Debert.

Construction of the aerodrome, which would host the RAF&#x27;s No. 31 Operational Training Unit (O.T.U.), began in the fall of 1940 and was completed in April 1941, coinciding with the construction of the army&#x27;s adjoining Camp Debert. The airfield itself consisted of three 5000 ft runways arranged in an overlapping triangle.

31 O.T.U was one of several similar facilities constructed in the Maritime provinces in support of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and RAF Ferry Command. Aircrew trained at Debert to ferry newly manufactured aircraft from the United States and Canada across the Atlantic. Aircrew were trained on the Lockheed Hudson and de Havilland Mosquito.

No. 31 OTU was later taken over by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 1944 and re-designated No. 7 O.T.U. After the cessation of hostilities in Europe, RCAF Debert briefly hosted 420 and 425 Squadrons as part of Tiger Force, a long-range Commonwealth bomber group formed to strike against Japan. 420 and 425 operated Avro Lancaster bombers as training aircraft to prepare for their new role. Tiger Force was disbanded after Japan&#x27;s surrender in September. RCAF Station Debert closed soon after but was still owned and maintained by the RCAF.

===Aerodrome===
In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Debert, Nove Scotia at with a variation of 24 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as &quot;All hard surfaced&quot; and had three runways listed as follows:
===Relief landing field - Maitland===
The relief landing field for RCAF Station Debert was located near the village of Maitland. In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Maitland, Nova Scotia at with a variation of 23.5 degrees west and no elevation was specified. The field was listed as &quot;Hard under construction&quot; and had one runway listed as follows:
===Postwar===
Following the closure, the aerodrome at Debert underwent some downsizing but continued to support active flight operations as a training, refuelling, and maintenance base until 1954 even though no operational squadrons were stationed there.

In 1960, the RCAF transferred its aerodrome to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) which used the facility for aircraft carrier landing practise in support of naval aviation aircraft stationed at nearby Royal Canadian Naval Air Station (RCNAS) Shearwater. Also in the 1960s, some unused hangar space at the aerodrome was used to house a medical equipment supply depot which was used by all three branches of the armed forces.

On February 1, 1968, the merger of the three service branches into the unified Canadian Forces saw the end of flight operations at the Debert aerodrome and in 1971 the Department of National Defence designated , consisting of the aerodrome and the majority of the training area used by the former Camp Debert, as surplus. The provincial government purchased this land for development into the &quot;Debert Air Industrial Park&quot; while the aerodrome continues to be used as a municipal airfield, known as Debert Airport.

==Maritime &quot;Diefenbunker”==

In 1958, at the height of the Cold War and the infancy of the ICBM threat, Debert was selected as the site for 1 of 6 communication centres and &quot;Regional Emergency Government Headquarters&quot; complexes being located across Canada. The Debert facility would be the only such complex built in the Maritime provinces.

A small part of Camp Debert was proposed to be used for the complex along with supporting surface structures and personnel housing. Construction began in 1960 on an underground 2-storey bunker (approximately half the size of the CEGHQ, located in Carp, Ontario) capable of withstanding a near-hit from a nuclear explosion (an approximate radius). The underground building had blast doors at the surface, as well as extensive air filters (mainly against biological, chemical and radioactive contaminants). Underground storage was built for food, fuel, fresh water, and other supplies for the facility which was capable of supporting 350 people for 90 days. These blast shelters, nicknamed &quot;Diefenbunkers&quot;, were administered by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals.

Opening in 1964, the Debert facility was already outdated, since ICBM targeting had improved to the point where a direct hit was possible on the bunker. However the site persisted as a Provincial Warning Centre (for Nova Scotia), staffed by the 720 Communication Squadron, along with the space for the emergency government. Antenna farms were dispersed from the bunker and were located on the shores of Cobequid Bay in nearby Masstown as well as in the Cobequid Hills near Londonderry.

On February 1, 1968, the merger of the three service branches into the Canadian Forces saw the Diefenbunker and support facilities, the last remnants of Camp Debert, change its name to Canadian Forces Station Debert (CFS Debert), in keeping with the naming convention for minor military facilities across Canada.

In the 1970s, CFS Debert, as with most Diefenbunker facilities across the country, was downgraded further as the number of personnel were reduced. Attempts to find other uses for the remaining military facilities took place through the 1980s with militia reserve units training at CFS Debert.

In 1982 CFS Debert was equipped with Telegraph Automated Relay Equipment (TARE) which was used to relay communications received at the nearby Satellite Ground Terminal Folly Lake.

The end of the Cold War and reduction in the ICBM threat, as well as the Diefenbunker&#x27;s obsolescence, saw all remaining military personnel removed from CFS Debert by the mid-1990s. In 1998 the Department of National Defence finished all environmental assessments and decommissioned the facility, transferring the facility to &quot;Colchester Park&quot;, a local development authority.

Today the only remnant of a once-vast military presence in Debert is a firing range used by militia reserve units from Cumberland, Colchester and Pictou counties.

In 1985 the Royal Canadian Air Cadets began to use the airfield for glider training. The first year saw air tow and winch operations, later years used a significant amount of auto tow supplemented with air tow launches. The regional gliding school used the agricultural college in Truro for the ground school, administration and dormitories.

In 2005, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets used the Diefenbunker for its Regional Gliding School (Atlantic) Headquarters. Air cadets from Atlantic Canada ranging in age from 15 to 18 trained at the adjacent Debert Airport for the Advanced Aviation Course and Glider Pilot Scholarship programs.

In December 2008 the Diefenbunker was sold by the Colchester Regional Development Association to a private data warehousing and data centre co-location services provider, Bastionhost. Bastionhost was going to renovate the facility as a high-density, groundwater-cooled data centre.

In November 2012 the Diefenbunker was sold again by the Municipality of the County of Colchester to recover unpaid taxes from the previous owner, Dataville Farms Ltd. It was purchased by Jonathan Baha&#x27;i for $31,300 along with the adjoining parking lot for $4150. The new owner has indicated he intends to use the facility for a data centre with an emphasis on cloud storage. Other parts of the facility may be used for unspecified research and development. In 2013, a part of the bunker was used to film an independent movie, &quot;Bunker 6&quot;. It was also used for a paintball game.

The previous CBC Studio located in the bunker has been turned into a media recording studio called Top Secret Sounds.

June 2014 the official website for the Debert Diefenbunker revealed the intent to offer leased space within the bunker including self-storage.

==Debert Military Museum==
The Debert Military Museum maintains Debert&#x27;s military history with a nineteen-room museum located in &quot;Colchester Park&quot;. The museum is a registered charity and is managed by a volunteer board of directors. The museum has a diverse collection of military memorabilia from both World Wars as well as the Cold War and Korean War. The Debert Military Museum is the only museum in Canada that houses a display of Russian photographs presented to the Museum by the Russian Ambassador of Canada. The museum features items donated by members and family members of the Canadian and British militaries, including uniforms, decorations, communications equipment and documents. It no longer offers tours of the Debert Bunker, while still retaining information and artifacts about it.

<text>Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) is a division of The Boeing Company based in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The division builds military airplanes, rotorcraft, and missiles, as well as space systems for both commercial and military customers, including satellites, spacecraft, and rockets.

It was formerly known as Boeing Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), which was formed in 2002 by combining the former &quot;Military Aircraft and Missile Systems&quot; and &quot;Space and Communications&quot; divisions. The group that brought together major names in aerospace; Boeing Military Airplane Company; Hughes Satellite Systems; Hughes Helicopters (the civilian helicopter line was divested as MD Helicopters); Piasecki Helicopter (subsequently known as Boeing Vertol and Boeing Helicopters); the McDonnell division of McDonnell Douglas; and the former North American Aviation division of Rockwell International.

Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security made Boeing the third-largest defense contractor in the world in 2021 and helped make Boeing the second-largest U.S. federal government contractor in fiscal year 2019.

== History ==
Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security was headquartered in Greater St. Louis north of St. Louis Lambert International Airport in the northern St. Louis suburb of Berkeley, Missouri, until January 2017, when top executives and support staff were relocated to Arlington, Virginia. There are also significant operations in nearby Missouri communities, such as Hazelwood and St. Charles. It remains one of the largest employers in Greater St. Louis with 13,707 local employees as of 2018.

Other major locations of BDS are in California and Washington state. Boeing chose to locate the defense systems offices in the St. Louis area because of the role of the space and aircraft programs of the former McDonnell Douglas location, and bipartisan support from area politicians.

In 2016, Boeing moved the division headquarters from St. Louis to Arlington, Virginia in the Washington, D.C. area and located close to The Pentagon.

On October 26, 2020, Boeing was sanctioned by the Chinese government due to arm sales to Taiwan.

In October 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing was exploring a sale of some of its space division programs including the Starliner spacecraft and operations that support the International Space Station.

<text>Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) is a division of the Boeing Company. It designs, assembles, markets, and sells commercial aircraft, including the 737, 767, 777, and 787, along with freighter and business jet variants of most. The division employs nearly 35,000 people, many working at the company&#x27;s division headquarters in Renton, Washington, or at more than a dozen engineering, manufacturing, and assembly facilities, notably the Everett Factory and Renton Factory (both outside of Seattle), and the South Carolina Factory.

It includes the assets of the Douglas Aircraft division of the former McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which merged with Boeing in 1997. As of the end of 2021, BCA employed about 35,926 people.

== Organization ==

Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) is organized as:
* Airplane Programs
** Boeing Renton Factory 737
** Boeing Everett Factory 767 and 777
** Boeing South Carolina 787
** Fabrication Division
** Global Partners
** Propulsion Systems
* Commercial Aviation Services

BCA subsidiaries:
* Aeroinfo Systems
* Aviall
* Aviation Partners Boeing, a 50/50 joint venture with Aviation Partners Inc.
* Boeing Canada
* Boeing Capital
* Boeing Training &amp; Flight Services (was Alteon Training)
* CDG
* Jeppesen, formerly Jeppesen Sanderson.
* Preston Aviation Solutions

== Management ==
In November 2016, Boeing announced that Ray Conner would step down immediately as BCA&#x27;s president and CEO. He was succeeded by Kevin G. McAllister, who was the first outside recruitment in BCA history. McAllister was instructed by Dennis Muilenburg to triple revenue from aftermarket services from $15 billion to a target of $50 billion over 10 years, with a new purpose-built unit headed by Stan Deal. Keith Leverkuhn was the vice president and general manager of the 737 MAX program in March 2017 when it received certification.

McAllister was eventually ousted by Boeing in October 2019, in the midst of a company crisis following two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jets. Stan Deal succeeded him in both of his positions. One insider called McAllister a &quot;scapegoat&quot; as he had only joined BCA during the later stages of the 737 MAX&#x27;s development. In March 2024, Deal was in turn replaced by Stephanie Pope, formerly head of the Boeing Global Services division.

== Products ==

=== Model naming convention ===

For all models sold beginning with the Boeing 707 in 1957, except the Boeing 720, Boeing&#x27;s naming system for commercial airliners has taken the form of 7X7 (X representing a number). All model designations from 707 through 787 have been assigned, leaving 797 as the only 7X7 model name not assigned to a product.

For models 707 to 777, the full model number consists of an airplane&#x27;s model number, for example, 707 or 747, followed by a hyphen and three digits that represent the series within the model, for example, 707-320 or 747-400. In aviation circles, a more specific model designation is sometimes used where the last two digits of the series designator are replaced by the two-digit, alpha-numeric Boeing customer code, for example, 747-121, representing a 747-100 originally ordered by Pan American World Airways (Boeing customer code 21) or 737-7H4, representing a 737-700 originally ordered by Southwest Airlines (Boeing customer code H4). Codes do not change for aircraft transferred from one airline to another. Unlike other models, the 787 uses a single digit to designate the series, for example, 787-8. This convention was followed in the development of the newest version of the 747, the 747-8, along with the 737 MAX and 777X series.

Additional letters are sometimes appended to the model name as a suffix, including &quot;ER&quot; to designate an &quot;extended range&quot; version, such as the 777-300ER, or &quot;LR&quot; to designate a &quot;long range&quot; version, for example 777-200LR. Other suffix designators include &quot;F&quot; for &quot;freighter&quot; (747-400F), &quot;C&quot; for &quot;convertible&quot; aircraft that can be converted between a passenger and freighter configuration (727-100C), &quot;SR&quot; or &quot;D&quot; for &quot;short range&quot; and &quot;domestic&quot; (747-400D, 747SR), and &quot;M&quot; for &quot;combi&quot; aircraft that are configured to carry both passengers and freight at the same time (757-200M, 747-400M). Passenger aircraft that are originally manufactured as passenger aircraft and later converted to freighter configuration by Boeing carry the suffix &quot;BCF&quot; designating a Boeing converted freighter (747-400BCF).

=== Specialty and other aircraft ===
Airlines commonly order aircraft with special features or options, but Boeing builds certain models specifically for a particular customer.
* The Boeing 707-138B was a shortened-fuselage, long-range model only sold to Qantas.
* The Boeing 757-200M was a single-example model built for Royal Nepal Airlines (now called Nepal Airlines). This plane could be converted between passenger and freighter configuration. It was launched by Royal Nepal Airlines in 1986 and delivered two years later.
* Boeing 747
** The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft
** The Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter (now named the Dreamlifter) is a wide-body cargo aircraft.
** The 747SP production resumed nearly four years after the supposedly final 747SP was built. It had a cockpit crew of two instead of the three-crew layout of other 747SPs.
** Two Boeing VC-25s were built for the US Air Force as Presidential Air Force One transports. This model was a highly modified 747-200B.
** Four Boeing 747-100SRs were built for Japan Airlines for a domestic flight service.
** Nine Boeing 747-100Bs were built for Iran Air and Saudi Arabian Airlines, which had a stronger airframe and landing gear, as well as an increased fuel capacity.
* Boeing was a consultant to Sukhoi on the Russian Regional Jet program that subsequently became the Sukhoi Superjet 100 twin-engine narrowbody airliner.

<doc id="875445" wikidata="Q1498774" url="?curid=875445" title="1977 Nestlé boycott">
<text>A boycott was launched in the United States on July 4, 1977, against the Swiss-based multinational food and drink processing corporation Nestlé. The boycott expanded into Europe in the early 1980s and was prompted by concerns about Nestlé&#x27;s aggressive marketing of infant formulas (i.e., substitutes for breast milk), particularly in underdeveloped countries. The boycott has been cancelled and renewed because of the business practices of Nestlé and other substitute manufacturers monitored by the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN). Organizers of the boycott as well as public health researchers and experts consider breast milk to be the best nutrition source for infants. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends infants to be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their lives, nevertheless, nutritional gaps must be filled if breastfeeding is not possible.

The Nestlé boycott can be seen as special in a sense that it linked human rights regulations and humanitarian activism with corporate responsibility and market capitalism. Consumers were basically acting as global citizens by aiding people in need outside their close communities – mothers in developing countries – &quot;using the marketplace not as a way of generating revenue, but rather as a space for protest&quot;.

==Baby milk controversy==
In 2007, groups including the International Baby Food Action Network and Save the Children issued reports that the promotion of infant formula over breastfeeding led to health problems and deaths among infants in less economically developed countries. There are three problems that can arise when poor mothers in developing countries switch to formula as well as one list of benefits of breast milk:

* Sanitation:
**Formula must be mixed with water, which is often impure or not potable in poor countries, leading to disease in vulnerable infants. Because of the low literacy rates in developing nations, many mothers are not aware of the sanitation methods needed in the preparation of bottles. Even mothers able to read in their native language may be unable to read the language in which sterilization directions are written.
**Although some mothers can understand the sanitation standards required, they often do not have the means to perform them: fuel to boil water, electric (or other reliable) light to enable sterilisation at night. UNICEF estimates that a formula-fed child living in disease-ridden and unhygienic conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child.
* Nutritional value: 
** Many poor mothers use less formula for the baby than is required, in order to make a container of formula last longer. As a result, some infants receive inadequate nutrition from weak solutions of formula.
**Breast milk has many natural benefits lacking in formula. Nutrients and antibodies are passed to the baby while hormones are released into the mother&#x27;s body. Breastfed babies are protected, in varying degrees, from a number of illnesses, including diarrhea, bacterial meningitis, gastroenteritis, ear infection, and respiratory infection. Breast milk contains the right amount of the nutrients essential for neuronal (brain and nerve) development. The bond between baby and mother can be strengthened during breastfeeding. Frequent and exclusive breastfeeding can also delay the return of fertility, which can help women in developing countries to space their births. The World Health Organization recommends that, in the majority of cases, babies should be exclusively breast fed for the first six months, and then given complementary foods in addition to breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.
*Preserving milk supply:
**The practice of relying on free formula in maternity wards frequently means the mother loses the ability to make her own milk and must buy formula (as stated in the following paragraph).

Advocacy groups and charities have accused Nestlé of unethical methods of promoting infant formula over breast milk to poor mothers in developing countries. For example, IBFAN claims that Nestlé distributes free formula samples to hospitals and maternity wards; after leaving the hospital, the formula is no longer free, but because the supplementation has interfered with lactation, the family must continue to buy the formula. IBFAN also alleges that Nestlé uses &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; to create markets, does not label its products in a language appropriate to the countries where they are sold, and offers gifts and sponsorship to influence health workers to promote its products. The company not only made use of mass media promotion (e.g. billboards and posters) and sample distributions, they also had sales people dressed as so-called &quot;milk nurses&quot; to visit mothers in hospital and at their home to praise formula and its benefits. Nestlé justified its actions by rejecting the responsibility for e.g. the lack of clean water in many developing countries and further argued with freedom of consumer choice, which in the company&#x27;s opinion allows for formula products to be sold in developing markets.

==History==

===1970s===
Nestlé&#x27;s marketing strategy was first written about in &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine in 1973 and in a booklet called &quot;The Baby Killer&quot;, published by the British NGO War On Want in 1974. The report helped raise concern over marketing practices in developing countries and served as the starting point of the so-called Baby Killer campaign. Nestlé started a legal suit in Switzerland when the booklet was published in German language entitled &quot;Nestlé kills Babies&quot;. After a two-year trial, the court found in favour of Nestlé because they could not be held responsible for the infant deaths &#x27;in terms of criminal law&#x27;. Because the defendants were only fined 300 Swiss Francs (just over US$400, adjusted for inflation), and Judge Jürg Sollberger commented that Nestlé &quot;must modify its publicity methods fundamentally&quot;, &quot;TIME&quot; magazine declared this a &quot;moral victory&quot; for the defendants. This led to similar court challenges brought against other milk companies in the U.S. spearheaded by the Roman Catholic order Sisters of the Precious Blood in conjunction with the Interfaith Centre for Corporate Responsibility. 

The widespread publicity led to the launch of the boycott in Minneapolis, USA, by the Infant Formula Action Coalition (INFACT) and this boycott soon spread to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Europe as more and more people were concerned by Nestlé&#x27;s marketing practices to promote baby formula instead of breast milk, especially in the developing world. In May 1978, the US Senate held a public hearing into the promotion of breast milk substitutes in developing countries and joined calls for a Marketing Code. In 1979, WHO and UNICEF hosted an international meeting that called for the development of an international code of marketing, as well as action on other fronts to improve infant and early child feeding practices. The International Baby Food Action Network was formed by six of the campaigning groups at this meeting.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1981, the 34th World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body for WHO, adopted Resolution WHA34.22 which includes the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. The Code covers infant formula and other milk products, foods and beverages, when marketed or otherwise represented to be suitable as a partial or total replacement of breast milk. It bans the promotion of breast milk substitutes and gives health workers the responsibility for advising parents. It limits manufacturing companies to the provision of scientific and factual information to health workers and sets forth labeling requirements. The US voted against the adoption. 

In 1984, boycott coordinators met with Nestlé, which agreed to create an independent agency, the Nestlé Infant Formula Audit Commission (IFAC), and to sign an agreement where they pledged to fully implement the Code. The boycott was then officially suspended. In 1988, a second phase of the boycott started as IBFAN alleged that formula companies were flooding health facilities in the developing world with free and low-cost supplies, and the boycott was relaunched the following year.

In May 1999, a ruling against Nestlé was issued by the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Nestlé claimed in an anti-boycott advertisement that it markets infant formula &quot;ethically and responsibly&quot;. The ASA found that Nestlé could not support this nor other claims in the face of evidence provided by the campaigning group Baby Milk Action.

===2000s onwards===
In November 2000, the European Parliament invited IBFAN, UNICEF, and Nestlé to present evidence to a public hearing before the Development and Cooperation Committee. Evidence was presented by the IBFAN group from Pakistan and UNICEF&#x27;s legal officer commented on Nestlé&#x27;s failure to bring its policies into line with the World Health Assembly Resolutions. Nestlé declined an invitation to attend, claiming scheduling conflicts, although it sent a representative of the auditing company it had commissioned to produce a report on its Pakistan operation.

Throughout the years, Nestlé has claimed that it is in full compliance with the International Code. In 2001, for example, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, at the time CEO of Nestlé, stated: &quot;we also carry out annual audits on WHO Code compliance with a sample of Nestlé companies, and we investigate any substantiated claims made by those who believe we have broken the Code... If we find that the Code has been deliberately violated, we take disciplinary action.&quot; The company maintained that many of the allegations are unsubstantiated, out of date, or use IBFAN&#x27;s own non-standard interpretation of the Code.

In May 2011, the debate over Nestlé&#x27;s unethical marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written an open letter to the company. Among other unethical practices, the NGOs criticised the lack of labelling in Laos and the provision of incentives to doctors and nurses to promote the use of infant formula. An independent audit of Nestlé&#x27;s marketing practices in Laos was commissioned by Nestlé and carried out by Bureau Veritas in late 2011. The audit found that &quot;the requirements of the WHO Code and Lao PDR Decree are well embedded throughout the business&quot;, but that &quot;promotional materials in 4% of the retail outlets visited&quot; violated either the Lao PDR Decree or the WHO Code.

In a 2018 study, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) estimated that 10,870,000 infants had died between 1960 and 2015 as a result of Nestlé baby formula used by &quot;mothers [in low and middle-income countries] without clean water sources&quot;, with deaths peaking at 212,000 in 1981.

In 2024, a report by Swiss nonprofit Public Eye and IBFAN stated that Nestlé adds more sugar to baby food sold in lower- and middle-income countries compared to healthier versions sold in affluent markets.

==Current status==

The boycott is on-going , Nestlé also officially states on their website that it &quot;follow[s] the WHO Code as implemented by national governments everywhere in the world&quot;. The company states that it updates its marketing policy, that it reports on compliance on an annual basis, and that it set up a whistleblower scheme. Nestlé states that it is &quot;committed not to interfere with mothers&#x27; desire to breastfeed and to protect them from inappropriate marketing practices by actively supporting breastfeeding&quot;. Critics state that Nestlé continues to be accused of malpractice.

Data from 2020 indicates that 136 WHO member states had established some legal measures related to the Code from 1981, however, only few fully reflect the Code. The report indicates a gap in many countries&#x27; legislation. IBFAN continues to be an international network, encompassing more than 270 groups in over 160 countries who push for implementations of the marketing of breast-milk substitutes Code and relevant resolutions. The overall goal remains: marketing baby food should not have negative impacts on infants&#x27; health.

In 2024, a new controversy arose when Nestlé was criticized for adding sugar and honey to infant milk and cereal products in certain countries.

==In the media==
An episode of the TV show &quot;The Mark Thomas Comedy Product&quot; produced by the British Channel Four in 1999 investigated the boycott and Nestlé&#x27;s practices concerning baby milk. Mark Thomas attempted to find evidence for claims against Nestlé and to speak to heads of the company. In one portion of the show he &quot;received a tin of baby milk from Mozambique. All instructions are in English. 33 languages and dialects are recognised in Mozambique. Portuguese is the official language. However, only about 30% of the population can speak it.

In 2001, comedian Robert Newman and actress Emma Thompson called for a boycott of the Perrier Comedy Award, because Perrier is owned by Nestlé. An alternative competition called the Tap Water Awards was set up the following year.

In 2002, authors Germaine Greer and Jim Crace withdrew from the Hay Festival in protest over Nestlé&#x27;s sponsorship of the event.

A 2007 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; highlighted aggressive marketing practices by Nestlé in Bangladesh.

The 2014 film &quot;Tigers&quot; is based on 1997 Pakistan Nestle infant formula controversy.

<text>David Samuel Horne MacDonald (born August 20, 1936) is a Canadian United Church of Canada minister, former politician, and author.

==Early life==
Born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, David MacDonald was ordained in the United Church by the Maritime Conference on June 11, 1961, and was a minister at Alberton, Tignish, and Cascumpec, Prince Edward Island before going into federal politics.

==Political career==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) from the former Prince Edward Island riding of Prince in the 1965 election, and was re-elected in the realigned Egmont riding from 1968 until 1979.

After the Tory victory in the 1979 election, he was appointed Minister of Communications, Minister responsible for the Status of Women and Secretary of State for Canada in the short-lived Cabinet of Prime Minister Joe Clark.

MacDonald lost his seat to Liberal George Henderson in the 1980 election but returned to the House as MP in the Toronto riding of Rosedale in the 1988 election, replacing former Toronto Mayor and PC incumbent David Crombie.

However, he lost his seat again to a Liberal majority government in the 1993 election, this time to Bill Graham. Two other notable candidates ran against MacDonald in this election: future New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton, and magician Doug Henning for the Natural Law Party of Canada.

MacDonald also spent time in Africa between parliamentary duties.

MacDonald had a reputation as a Red Tory and subsequently switched his political allegiance to the social democratic New Democratic Party of Canada. He ran as the NDP candidate in his old riding (now called Toronto Centre-Rosedale) in the 1997 election, but was defeated again by Graham.

==After politics==
On November 25, 1998, The United Church of Canada appointed MacDonald a &quot;Special Advisor&quot; on residential schools, in light of major lawsuits against the UCC from former students.

==Personal life==
MacDonald was romantically involved with Alexa McDonough who at the time was leader of the federal NDP, prior to his 1997 candidacy. However, they split up prior to the 2004 federal election. MacDonald has since started another relationship and married.

<doc id="875455" wikidata="Q3622969" url="?curid=875455" title="Hambledon, Surrey">
<text>Hambledon is a rural scattered village in the Waverley borough of Surrey, situated south of Guildford. It is dominated by a buffer zone of fields and woodland, mostly south of the Greensand Ridge escarpment between Witley and Chiddingfold, having no dual carriageways or railways; however, it is bordered to the west by the Portsmouth Direct Line, and many of its small population are London commuters or retirees. Its main amenities are a church, a village pub, and the village shop and post office.

==History and description==
Hambledon appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Hameledune&quot; held overall by Rannulf from Edward de Sarisber (Salisbury). Its Domesday assets were: 3 hides of land; 7 ploughlands, 1 mill worth 2s 6d, of meadow, woodland worth 30 hogs. It rendered £5 per year to its feudal overlords.

In the 16th century, part of its land was mined for iron ore. This became replaced by the 18th and 19th centuries by brickmaking.

A local traditional legend claims there is buried treasure at Tolt Hill, near Hambledon, but no one has searched for it because it belongs to the Devil.

==Landmarks==
*The parish church is Hambledon Church. Its traditional dedication is to St Peter. Built on top of a hill on Church Lane, its churchyard contains two gigantic yew trees – one with a circumference and hollow, with space for four people inside. The trees outdate the present church by many centuries. Each Sunday there are two services the earlier with a traditional theme and the later being contemporary. Today&#x27;s building was constructed in the 19th century, although it does contain traces of its 14th century predecessor. Hambledon Church now forms a joint benefice with Busbridge Church.
*St Dominic&#x27;s School is atop Mount Olivet, a hill.
*Oakhurst Cottage – a traditional 16th century timber-framed labourer&#x27;s home, which has been restored and is now owned by the National Trust.
*Merry Harriers pub
*Hambledon Village Shop &amp; Post Office - a community owned and run grocery shop, cafe and Post Office.

==Former landmark==

===Workhouse===
Hambledon workhouse established under the Poor Laws was used by King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley in nearby Wormley from 1940 to 1949 while the school buildings were taken over by the Royal Navy. A short distance up the hill, close to the A283 Petworth Road, is the building. It was managed by the Hambledon Poor Law Union, formed in 1836. An infirmary block and a mortuary were built to the north of the site in the 1870s, and these buildings later became Hambledon Hospital, which closed in 1948.

The buildings were used by Surrey County Council as an old peoples home until the early 1970s.

The buildings were then used by the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences until the 1990s when the site was acquired by property developers Berkeley Homes and redeveloped for residential use. Its workhouse survives converted into apartments.

To the north at Hydestile, within Hambledon&#x27;s boundary, is the site of two former hospitals, King George V Hospital and St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital. This site has now been redeveloped.

==Geography==
The village is SSW of the county town of Surrey, Guildford, and south of Godalming, which is the administrative centre of the borough of Waverley. In the centre of the civil parish are the greatest number of buildings, mostly linear. Hambledon is centred on a high watershed between the English Channel and North Sea. Two watercourses ultimately drain the village, neither in the parish, the River Wey and the River Arun, the former having a small stream, the West Brook of Godalming, which rises here.

In Hambledon&#x27;s northern part (and south of it) are uplands of the Greensand Ridge, which can be explored using roads (in places) or the long-distance path, the Greensand Way.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

*W. D. Caroe, architect
*Winton Dean, Handel Prize-winning musicologist
*Sir John Fletcher, 1st Baronet, Member of Parliament for Hampstead
*Robin Harrison, Warden of Merton College, Oxford

==Derivations==
In Sydney, a cottage was built by John Macarthur for Penelope Lucas, the governess to his children. She named it &quot;Hambledon Cottage&quot; after Hambledon, Surrey.

<text>John Patton (March 1, 1822 – November 15, 1900) was the mayor of Detroit, Michigan, in 1858–1859.

==Biography==
John Patton was born March 1, 1822, in the county of County Down, Ireland, the son of James and Eliza Patton. In 1830, John and his father emigrated to Albany, New York, and were joined by the rest of the family the next year. At 17, John Patton was apprenticed as a carriagesmith, and in 1843 moved to Detroit, where he worked for others at his trade. Two years later, he went into business as a carriagemaker for himself. The fire of 1848 destroyed his factory, but Patton soon rebuilt, and his business prospered.

In 1845, Patton married Eliza J. Anderson. The couple had five children: William, Walter, Mrs. John McLean, Mrs. E. B. Gay, and John.

Patton rapidly became popular in the city, due in part to his &quot;masterly&quot; delivery of reading, thespian skills, and command of Scotch and Irish dialects. He served as chief engineer of the Fire Department in 1852–1854 and its president from 1855 to 1857. He was a Democrat in politics, and awas elected a city alderman in 1853–1854, mayor in 1858–1859, county auditor in 1864–1869, Wayne County, Michigan, sheriff in 1869–1870, Justice of the Peace from 1880– 1892 and United States consul at Amherstburg, Ontario, from 1893 to 1897.

John Patton died November 15, 1900.

<text>Michael Dibdin (21 March 1947 – 30 March 2007) was a British crime fiction writer, best known for inventing Aurelio Zen, the principal character in 11 crime novels set in Italy.

== Early life ==
Dibdin was born in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire (now West Midlands), England. The son of a physicist, he was brought up from the age of seven in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, where he attended the Friends&#x27; School and was taught by James Simmons. He graduated with a degree in English from Sussex University, and then went to study for a Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

== Career ==
After publishing his first novel, a Sherlock Holmes pastiche, he lived for four years in Italy, teaching at the university in Perugia.

Dibdin is best known for his Aurelio Zen mysteries, set in Italy. The first of these, &quot;Ratking&quot;, won the Gold Dagger award of 1988. This series of detective novels provide a penetrating insight into the less visible aspects of Italian society over the last 20 years. The earlier books have a lightness of touch that gradually becomes much darker. The character of Zen himself is anti-heroic, which adds much to the books&#x27; irony and black humour. A final Zen book, &quot;End Games&quot;, appeared posthumously in July 2007.

He also wrote other detective works set in America and in the UK.

==Personal life==
Dibdin eventually settled in Seattle, Washington, United States.

Dibdin was married three times, most recently to the novelist K. K. Beck. He died in Seattle on 30 March 2007, aged 60, following a short illness.

<doc id="875465" wikidata="Q3020821" url="?curid=875465" title="Debert">
<text>Debert ( ; 2006 pop: 1,471) is an unincorporated farming community in Nova Scotia, Canada. Located in the central-western part of Colchester County, it is approximately west of Truro.

The community has two churches (United Baptist Church and United Church of Canada), Royal Canadian Legion (Branch 106), a skating rink, a community centre, two vehicle repair garages, one convenience store, and a volunteer fire department.

Debert is situated near coal and iron ore deposits that were mined in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Debert became a station stop on the Halifax-Montreal mainline of the Intercolonial Railway in the 1870s. This railway line continues to this day under the ownership of Canadian National Railway (CN Rail), with passenger service provided by Via Rail, but without a stop at Debert.

==Military history==

During the Second World War Debert was the location of a Canadian Army base named Debert Military Camp and an adjoining Royal Canadian Air Force station named RCAF Station Debert. Camp Debert was an army facility capable of accommodating division-size units where personnel received training prior to deployment to Europe. RCAF Station Debert was used as a British Commonwealth Air Training Plan facility which saw pilots and aircrew from Commonwealth nations trained for military service.

Demobilization of the military during the post-war brought about many other changes at Camp Debert with many of the barrack buildings and workshops being demolished. Many materials were salvaged from the demolition and reused to help construct numerous new homes in the nearby village of Debert and throughout this part of Colchester County.

For a brief period shortly after the war, the Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC) operated out of the old Camp Debert hospital. The temporary relocation of NSAC resulted from a major fire that had occurred at the principal campus in Bible Hill, which destroyed many barns and academic facilities.

Camp Debert&#x27;s role as a training facility was eliminated in the early 1950s with the opening of the much larger Camp Gagetown in New Brunswick. The airfield (Debert Airport) was downgraded at this time to an adjunct facility for RCAF Station Shearwater.

A new lease on life was given to the military facility in the early 1960s when Camp Debert was chosen as the location for a Regional Emergency Government Headquarters, also known as a &quot;Diefenbunker&quot;. This facility became the focus of the newly formed CFS Debert by the late 1960s.

The primary unit attached to CFS Debert was the 720 Communications Squadron, which maintained the REGHQ and provided communications support to Canadian Armed Forces units throughout Atlantic Canada and around the world. Substantial radio transmitter and receiver stations were constructed close to the nearby villages of Masstown and Great Village to support the military operations at CFS Debert, providing worldwide radio communications.

In 1971 the aerodrome and training facilities were declared surplus and were purchased by the provincial government to create the &quot;Debert Air Industrial Park&quot; as well as a municipal airfield.

CFS Debert was closed in the mid-1990s and decommissioned in 1998 with remaining military facilities being transferred to a local development authority named &quot;Colchester Park&quot;. The ongoing residual military communications role of Debert was transferred to the transmitter/receiver facilities near Great Village and Masstown.

The Debert Airport is now also the location of Royal Canadian Air Cadets Summer Glider Scholarship program for the Atlantic region. More than 50 cadets earn their Transport Canada Glider Pilot License during a 6-week course each summer. The Debert Airport also offers the Advanced Aviation Course through Royal Canadian Air Cadets as of summer 2011.

==Paleo-Indian discovery==
A significant Paleo-Indian site was discovered on the grounds of the old military camp by a private contractor who was preparing a plot of land to be used as a tree farm. Researchers from Saint Mary&#x27;s University were requested to conduct a thorough archeological excavation on the site. Preliminary reports suggested that the site held evidence of human activity that pre-dated any other sites found within the northern part of Nova Scotia.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on 19 October 1972.

==Climate==
Debert has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with warm, wet summers with cool nights and long, cold, and very snowy winters. Debert&#x27;s inland position gives it some of the warmest summer days in all of Nova Scotia, but also gives it some of the chilliest winter nights.

<text>Chiddingfold is a village and civil parish in the Weald in the Waverley district of Surrey, England. It lies on the A283 road between Milford and Petworth. The parish includes the hamlets of Ansteadbrook, High Street Green and Combe Common.

Chiddingfold Forest, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, lies mostly within its boundaries.

==History==
The name of Chiddingfold &#x27;Chadynge&#x27;s fold&#x27;, , is derived from the Saxon, probably meaning the fold (enclosure for animals) &quot;in the hollow&quot;.

Between the 14th and 17th centuries, Chiddingfold was a centre for glass-making. Window glass was made in the village in the 1350s for St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, Westminster and St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

The village appears on Ignazio Danti&#x27;s 1565 map of the British Isles, which is on display at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy.

The Guy Fawkes festivities saw in 1887 the village policeman&#x27;s house attacked by a mob – he was later transferred elsewhere – he may have set the fire early or failed to prevent it from being lit before time. The event of 1929 faced wider unrest, culminating a week later with talk of ducking innocent Sgt Brake into the pond being stalled by 200 Surrey officers using specially requisitioned buses; the village pubs were ordered to close and a JP was on hand to read the Riot Act should it have proved necessary.

There was, from a date in the 19th century until the early 20th century, a tile and brickworks, extracting and processing the clay underlying the parish.

Chiddingfold has an archive which shows the history of Chiddingfold and the previous owners of Chiddingfold houses.

==Amenities==
===The Crown Inn===

&quot;The Crown Inn&quot; is one of the oldest inns in England. Built as a rest house for Cistercian monks on their pilgrimage from Winchester to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury, it claims to have been established in 1285 with the earliest recorded reference to the present building dated 1383; probably when the alehouse (the Halle) expanded to include accommodation, thus becoming an inn. Subsequently, it merged with the adjoining alehouse through common ownership. The Crown has seen many distinguished visitors down the years. In 1552, Edward VI, the &quot;boy king&quot;, attended by high officials of state, courtiers, peers and some 4000 men encamped on the village green. It is reputed that in 1591 his elder sister, Queen Elizabeth I, &quot;sojourned there for refreshment&quot; en route from Loseley Park to Cowdray Park: her expense roll for the journey showing two shillings being paid for a tonne of wine to be transported to the village from Ripley.

Night Intruder by Squadron Leader Jeremy Howard-Williams contains the following reference to VE Day celebrations on 8 May 1945:

“We had one long party stretching over four or five days, starting at the Crown at Chiddingfold, where they duly honoured the open booking we had made in December.”

===Other===
A church (St Mary&#x27;s), pond, shops and houses lie on three sides of the village green, with the forge on it. Almost half of the land is forested, matching its location within Anglo Saxon England, within The Weald.

The Chiddingfold Scout Group is very active with about 100 boys and girls as Beavers, Cubs and Scouts.

Chiddingfold Cricket Club has active first and second teams that compete in the L&#x27;Anson League and is welcome to new members. The club has an active junior section. Children in school years 1 to 6 train on Friday evenings throughout the summer term, with around 100 participating each week. Friday training has become an important social occasion aiding anyone in need of a drink and a burger at the end of the week. Older children train on Wednesday evening and winter training runs for all ages between Christmas and the start of the cricket season. The junior club actively competes in the Berkley Sport Two Counties League at every age group.

Chiddingfold has a substantial doctors&#x27; surgery.

===Events===
The village is known for its torchlit procession, bonfire and fireworks display on the Saturday evening closest to 5 November (Guy Fawkes Day). A village festival is also held every year on the village green on the 2nd Sunday in June.

==Hamlets==
===Ansteadbrook===
This minute southern settlement has a brook of the same name that rises just west at the larger hamlet of Almshouse Common in Haslemere civil parish and passes Lythe Hill Farm and Hotel, (architecturally in the second highest category), Grade II* listed above where further springs add to the flow on both sides of the brook.

In the hamlet itself Petworth Road, a road east from Haslemere forms a junction with Killinghurst Lane that leads towards Chiddingfold, where all the cottages are yet there are a remarkable line of four listed buildings for such a tiny settlement further along Petworth Road near the border with West Sussex are Benham&#x27;s Stud Farm and its Barn, Huntingfords and Cherry Tree Cottage.

===Highstreet Green===
This hamlet also lies on a small connecting road in a very wooded area starting southeast of Chiddingfold, at its centre is Dunsfold Ryse Farm and typical of the area, a Grade II listed, timber framed, 16th century house, Quince Cottage.

===Combe Common===
At the western fringe of the village centre is this common which plays host to events in the summer, and which residents of nearby roads sometimes include as their locality.

==Religion==

It is claimed a place of worship has stood on the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s Church of England since c978AD.

Chiddingfold Baptist Church is located in Woodside Road.

The Saint Teresa of Avila Catholic Church dates from 1959.

==Media links==
The village was the setting for the 1946 film &quot;The Years Between&quot; starring Michael Redgrave and Valerie Hobson.The rock band The Stranglers, then called The Guildford Stranglers, were based in Chiddingfold during their key formative period in the mid-seventies, sometimes using the name The Chiddingfold Chokers and frequenting The Crown Inn. The rock band Genesis built their studio The Farm in the parish in the early 1980s; they also rehearsed at the Chiddingfold Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Club and side-project Mike + The Mechanics shot the video for their 1995 hit, &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot;, on the village cricket green.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Notable residents==
The economist and ecological writer David Fleming was born in Chiddingfold in 1940, to Gold Dagger award-winning crime writer Joan Margaret Fleming.

Socialite Viva Seton Montgomerie spent her final years in the village, until her death in 1959.

The French-born abstract artist François Lanzi lived in Chiddingfold from 1971 until his death in 1988.

The progressive rock band Genesis purchased a farm in Chiddingfold in 1980 and re-modeled one of the buildings into a recording studio. Known as The Farm the band began recording there in 1981 and the individual members of the band have also recorded solo albums there.

<text>Adam Olearius (born Adam Ölschläger or Oehlschlaeger, 24 September 1599 – 22 February 1671) was a German scholar, mathematician, geographer and librarian. He became secretary to the ambassador sent by Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, to the Shah of Safavid (Iran), and published two books about the events and observations during his travels.

==Travels==
He was born at Aschersleben, near Magdeburg. His family name refers to the profession of Oil millers. After studying at Leipzig he became librarian and court mathematician to Frederick III, and in 1633 he was appointed secretary to the ambassadors Philipp Crusius, jurisconsult, and Otto Bruggemann, a merchant from Hamburg, sent by the duke to Muscovy and Persia in the hope of making arrangements by which his newly founded city of Friedrichstadt should become the terminus of an overland silk-trade. This embassy started from Gottorp on 22 October 1633 and travelled by Hamburg, Lübeck, Riga, Dorpat (five months&#x27; stay), Reval, Narva, Ladoga, and Novgorod to Moscow (14 August 1634). Here they concluded an advantageous treaty with Tsar Michael of Russia, and returned forthwith to Gottorp (14 December 16347 April 1635) to procure the ratification of this arrangement from the duke, before proceeding to Persia.

With this accomplished, they started afresh from Hamburg on 22 October 1635, arrived at Moscow on 29 March 1636; and left Moscow on 30 June for Balakhna near Nizhniy Novgorod, to where they had already sent agents (in 1634/1635) to prepare a vessel for their descent of the Volga. Their voyage down the great river and over the Caspian Sea was slow and hindered by accidents, especially by grounding, as near Darband on 14 November 1636; but at last, by way of Shamakhy (three months&#x27; delay here), Ardabil, Soltaniyeh and Kasvin, they reached the Persian court at Isfahan (3 August 1637) and were received by the Safavid king, Shah Safi (16 August).

Negotiations here were not as successful as at Moscow, and the embassy left Isfahan on 21 December 1637, and returned home by Rasht, Lenkoran, Astrakhan, Kazan, Moscow, and other places. At Reval, Olearius parted from his colleagues (15 April 1639) and embarked directly for Lübeck. On his way he had made a chart of the Volga, and partly for this reason Michael wished to either persuade or compel him to enter his service. Once back at Gottorp, Olearius became librarian to the duke, who also made him keeper of his cabinet of curiosities, and induced the tsar to excuse his (promised) return to Moscow. Under his care the Gottorp library and cabinet were greatly enriched in manuscripts, books, and oriental and other works of art: in 1651 he purchased, for this purpose, the collection of the Dutch scholar and physician, (born Berent ten Broecke). He died at Gottorp on 22 February 1671.

==Books==
It is by his admirable narrative of the Russian and the Persian legation (&quot;Beschreibung der muscowitischen und persischen Reise&quot;, Schleswig, 1647, and afterwards in several enlarged editions, 1656, etc.) that Olearius is best known, though he also published a history of Holstein (&quot;Kurtzer Begriff einer holsteinischen Chronic&quot;, Schleswig, 1663), a famous catalogue of the Holstein-Gottorp cabinet (1666), and a translation of the &quot;Gulistan&quot; (&quot;Persianisches Rosenthal&quot;, Schleswig, 1654), to which was written by Saadi Shirazi appended a translation of the fables of Luqman. A French version of the &quot;Beschreibung&quot; was published by Abraham de Wicquefort (&quot;Voyages en Moscovie, Tartarie et Perse, par Adam Olearius&quot;, Paris, 1656), an English version was made by John Davies of Kidwelly (&quot;Travels of the Ambassadors sent by Frederic, Duke of Holstein, to the Great Duke of Muscovy and the King of Persia&quot;, London, 1662; and 1669), and a Dutch translation by Dieterius van Wageningen (&quot;Beschrijvingh van de nieuwe Parciaensche ofte Orientaelsche Reyse&quot;, Utrecht, 1651); an Italian translation of the Russian sections also appeared (&quot;Viaggi di Moscovia&quot;, Viterbo and Rome, 1658). Paul Fleming the poet and J. A. de Mandelslo, whose travels to the East Indies are usually published with those of Olearius, accompanied the embassy. Under Olearius&#x27; direction the celebrated globe of Gottorp and armillary sphere were executed between 1654 and 1664; the globe was given to Peter the Great of Russia in 1713 by Duke Frederick&#x27;s grandson, Christian Augustus. Olearius&#x27; unpublished works include a &quot;Lexicon Persicum&quot; and several other Persian studies.

By his lively and well-informed writing he introduced Germany (and the rest of Europe) to Persian literature and culture. Montesquieu depended on him for local colour in writing his satiric &quot;Lettres Persanes&quot; (&quot;Persian Letters&quot;, 1721), though he used the French translation, &quot;Relation de voyage de Moscovie, Tartarie et de Perse.&quot; Among his many translations of Persian literature into German are Saadi&#x27;s &quot;Golistan&quot;: &quot;Persianischer Rosenthal. In welchem viel lustige Historien ... von ... Schich Saadi in Persianischer Sprache beschrieben,&quot; printed in Schleswig by Holwein in 1654.

<text>Sia Kate Isobelle Furler ( ; born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Adelaide, she started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut studio album, &quot;OnlySee&quot;, in Australia. Sia moved to London and provided vocals for the British duo Zero 7. She released her second studio album, &quot;Healing Is Difficult&quot;, in 2001 and her third, &quot;Colour the Small One&quot;, in 2004.

Sia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, &quot;Some People Have Real Problems&quot; and &quot;We Are Born&quot;, were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, she took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations &quot;Titanium&quot; (with David Guetta), &quot;Diamonds&quot; (for Rihanna), &quot;Wild Ones&quot; (with Flo Rida) and &quot;Pretty Hurts&quot; (for Beyoncé).

In 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and generated the top-ten single &quot;Chandelier&quot; and a trilogy of music videos she co-directed, starring child dancer Maddie Ziegler. Since then, she has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy. Sia&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;This Is Acting&quot; (2016), spawned her first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one single, &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;. That year she also began her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. Sia&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Everyday Is Christmas&quot;, was released in 2017. In 2019, Labrinth, Sia and Diplo released an album, &quot;LSD&quot;. Sia has written many songs for films. She released her feature film directorial debut, &quot;Music&quot;, in 2021 to generally negative reviews, alongside an album, &quot;Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture&quot;. Her tenth album, &quot;Reasonable Woman&quot;, was released in May 2024.

Sia is an advocate for animal rights. Among her accolades are nearly a dozen ARIA Awards, nine Grammy Award nominations and an MTV Video Music Award.

==Early life and education==
Sia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in Adelaide, South Australia. Her father, Phil Colson, is a musician, and her mother, Loene Furler, is an art lecturer. She is the niece of actor Kevin Colson. As a child, Sia imitated the performing style of Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Sting, and has since cited them as early influences. She attended Adelaide High School.

==Career==
In the mid-1990s, Sia started a career as a singer in the local acid jazz band Crisp. Sia collaborated with the band and contributed vocals to their album &quot;Word and the Deal&quot; (1996) and EP &quot;Delirium&quot; (1997).
In 1997 Crisp disbanded, and Sia released her debut studio album, &quot;OnlySee&quot;, on Flavoured Records, in Australia, on 23 December. The album sold about 1,200 copies. Unlike her later albums, &quot;OnlySee&quot; was marketed under her full name, &quot;Sia Furler&quot;. It was produced by Jesse Flavell.

===1997–2006: Zero 7, &quot;Healing Is Difficult&quot; and &quot;Colour the Small One&quot;===

After Crisp disbanded in 1997, Sia moved to London, where she performed as a background vocalist for British band Jamiroquai. She also provided vocals for English downtempo group Zero 7 on their first three studio albums and toured with the group. On Zero 7&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Simple Things&quot;, Sia contributed vocals to two tracks including the single &quot;Destiny&quot;, which peaked at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, she provided vocals for Zero 7 on &quot;Somersault&quot; and &quot;Speed Dial No. 2&quot; (from the album &quot;When It Falls&quot;). In 2006, Sia collaborated with Zero 7 for their third album, &quot;The Garden&quot;.

In 2000, Sia signed a recording contract with Sony Music&#x27;s sub-label DancePool and released a single, &quot;Taken for Granted&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2001, she released her second solo album, &quot;Healing Is Difficult&quot;, which blends retro jazz and soul music and lyrically discusses Sia&#x27;s dealing with the death of her first love affair. Displeased with the promotion of the album, Sia fired her manager, left Sony Music and signed with Go! Beat, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group (UMG). At the APRA Awards of 2002, Sia won the Breakthrough Songwriter category alongside Brisbane pop duo Aneiki&#x27;s Jennifer Waite and Grant Wallis.

In 2004, Sia released her third studio album, &quot;Colour the Small One&quot;. The album employs a mixture of acoustic instruments and electronic backing to her material. The album spawned four singles, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot; and &quot;Breathe Me&quot;, the latter of which charted in the United Kingdom, Denmark and France.

Dissatisfied with &quot;Colour the Small One&quot;″s poor marketing and the album&#x27;s struggle to connect with a mainstream audience, Sia relocated to New York City in 2005. During that time, &quot;Breathe Me&quot; appeared in the final scene of the U.S. HBO television series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, which helped increase Sia&#x27;s fame in the United States. Consequently, Sia&#x27;s manager, David Enthoven, set up a tour across the country to maintain her career.

===2007–2010: &quot;Some People Have Real Problems&quot; and &quot;We Are Born&quot;===

In 2007, Sia released a live album, &quot;Lady Croissant&quot;, which included eight live songs from her April 2006 performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York and one new studio recording—&quot;Pictures&quot;. A year later, she left Zero 7 on friendly terms, replaced by Eska Mtungwazi as the band&#x27;s frontwoman. Sia released her fourth studio album, &quot;Some People Have Real Problems&quot; on 8 January 2008. The album peaked at No. 41 in Australia and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.
It charted at No. 26 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Sia&#x27;s first to chart in the United States. &quot;Some People Have Real Problems&quot; yielded four singles, including &quot;The Girl You Lost to Cocaine&quot;. It peaked at No. 11 in the Netherlands and No. 12 in Spain; it additionally reached No. 8 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs. Another single from the album was &quot;Soon We&#x27;ll Be Found&quot;.

In May 2009, Sia released &quot;TV Is My Parent&quot; on DVD, which includes a live concert at New York&#x27;s Hiro Ballroom, four music videos and behind-the-scene footage. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, Sia won the Best Music DVD category for &quot;TV Is My Parent&quot;. She also received a nomination for Best Breakthrough Artist Album for &quot;Some People Have Real Problems&quot;.

In 2009, American singer Christina Aguilera approached Sia about writing ballads for Aguilera&#x27;s sixth studio album. The final product, &quot;Bionic&quot;, includes four songs co-written by Sia. Later in 2010, Sia also co-wrote &quot;Bound to You&quot; for of the film &quot;Burlesque&quot;, which starred Aguilera and Cher. The song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. In May 2011, Sia appeared on the inaugural season of the U.S. version of &quot;The Voice&quot; as an adviser for Aguilera, who served as a vocal coach and judge.

In June 2010, Sia released her fifth studio album, &quot;We Are Born&quot;. The release peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The release of the album was preceded by three singles: the lead single, &quot;You&#x27;ve Changed&quot;, was released in December 2009 and charted at No. 31 in Australia. The follow-up single, &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot;, peaked at No. 17 in Australia, No. 10 in the Netherlands and No. 27 in Switzerland. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010, &quot;We Are Born&quot; earned Sia two categories won: Best Independent Release and Best Pop Release. Meanwhile, at the 2011 APRA Music Awards, Sia received a nomination for Song of the Year for &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot;. To promote &quot;We Are Born&quot;, Sia gave the We Meaning You Tour, which visited North America and Europe in April–May 2010. She followed this with the We Are Born Tour, which visited Australia in February 2011 and North America in July–August 2011.

===2010–2013: Songwriting career and mainstream recognition===

Following the success of &quot;We Are Born&quot;, Sia became uncomfortable with her growing fame. She later told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I just wanted to have a private life. Once, as my friend was telling me they had cancer, someone came up and asked, in the middle of the conversation, if they could take a photograph with me. You get me? That&#x27;s enough, right?&quot; She refused to do promos for her tours, began to wear a mask on stage and became increasingly dependent on drugs and alcohol on the road; she considered suicide. Sia fired Enthoven and hired Jonathan Daniel, who suggested that she write songs for other artists.

Sia retired as a recording artist and began a career as a songwriter. She soon penned &quot;Titanium&quot; for American singer Alicia Keys, but it was later sent to David Guetta, who included Sia&#x27;s original demo vocals on the song and released it as a single in 2011. &quot;Titanium&quot; peaked within the top ten of record charts in the United States, Australia and numerous European regions. However, Sia recalled: &quot;I never even knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset. Because I had just retired, I was trying to be a pop songwriter, not an artist.&quot;

From 2011 to 2013, Sia also co-wrote songs for many recording artists, including Beyoncé, Kylie Minogue, Flo Rida and Rihanna. Her collaboration with Flo Rida, &quot;Wild Ones&quot;, peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was the tenth best-selling song of 2012 globally. In March 2012, Sia released a greatest hits album, &quot;Best Of...&quot;, in Australia.

===2013–2014: Breakthrough with &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;===
In October 2013, Sia released &quot;Elastic Heart&quot; featuring the Weeknd and Diplo for the soundtrack of the American film &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot; (2013). Sia executive-produced Brooke Candy&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Opulence&quot;, released in May 2014, and co-wrote 3 songs on the EP. In July 2014, Sia released her own sixth studio album, &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;. She again collaborated with Greg Kurstin. The album debuted at No. 1 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 52,000 copies. By October 2015, it was certified gold by the RIAA denoting 500,000 equivalent-album units sold in the United States. The record peaked at No. 1 in Australia and reached the top ten of charts in numerous European regions. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.
By early 2016, the album had sold 1 million copies worldwide.

&quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Chandelier&quot; was released in March 2014. The song peaked at No. 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Sia&#x27;s first entry on that chart as a lead artist. Elsewhere, the song experienced similar commercial success, ranking in the top ten of the record charts in Australia and numerous European regions. As of January 2015, the single had sold 2 million copies in the United States. &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; and &quot;Big Girls Cry&quot; were released as the second and third singles from the album, respectively, in June 2014.
In January 2015, Sia released a solo version of &quot;Elastic Heart&quot; as the fourth single from &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;; it eventually reached the top 20 on the Hot 100. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards (2015), Sia received four nominations for &quot;Chandelier&quot;: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Music Video.

For performances of songs from &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;, Sia chose not to show her face, either facing away from audiences or hiding it behind oversized platinum blonde wigs. In videos for the singles &quot;Chandelier&quot;, &quot;Elastic Heart&quot; and &quot;Big Girls Cry&quot;, choreographed by Ryan Heffington and co-directed by Sia and Daniel Askill, and in many of the promotional live performances, child dancer Maddie Ziegler performed as a proxy for Sia in bobbed blonde wigs similar to Sia&#x27;s familiar hairstyle. The three videos have received a total of more than 4 billion views on Vevo. Sia explained to Kristen Wiig in an interview in &quot;Interview&quot; magazine that she decided to conceal her face to avoid a celebrity lifestyle and maintain some privacy: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to have some control over my image. And I&#x27;m allowed to maintain some modicum of privacy. But also I would like not to be picked apart or for people to observe when I put on ten pounds or take off ten pounds or I have a hair extension out of place or my fake tan is botched. Most people don&#x27;t have to be under that pressure, and I&#x27;d like to be one of them.&quot; The video for &quot;Elastic Heart&quot; &quot;courted controversy and plaudits in equal measure&quot;, with some commentators perceiving it to have paedophilic undertones due to the relative ages of the dancers. Sia explained that the two dancers represented &quot;warring &#x27;Sia&#x27; self states&quot;, but she nevertheless apologised on Twitter to anyone who was &quot;triggered&quot;. Gia Kourlas wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2016 that Sia&#x27;s collaborations with Heffington have &quot;done more to raise the standards of dance in pop music than nearly any current artist integrating the forms&quot;. The &quot;Chandelier&quot; video was ranked as the 10th &quot;greatest music video&quot; of the 2010s by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

In 2014, Sia contributed to the soundtrack to the 2014 film adaptation of the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;. Sia, along with producer Greg Kurstin, wrote three new songs for the film as well as re-working songs from the musical. Sia, Kurstin and the film&#x27;s director Will Gluck were nominated for Best Original Song at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards for &quot;Opportunity&quot;.

===2015–2017: &quot;This Is Acting&quot;===
In an interview with &quot;NME&quot; in February 2015, Sia revealed that she had completed the follow-up to &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;, entitled &quot;This Is Acting&quot;. The album was another collaboration with producer and co-writer Greg Kurstin. Furler said that she released &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot; to free herself from her record deal and had planned simply to write for other artists, but the album&#x27;s success spurred her to continue writing her own music. The same month, alongside the digital deluxe release of &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;, she released a mobile game, &quot;Bob Job&quot;. &quot;Alive&quot; from &quot;This Is Acting&quot; was co-written by Adele and had originally been intended for her third album, &quot;25&quot;.

In November, Sia collaborated with composer J. Ralph on the soundtrack of the environmental documentary &quot;Racing Extinction&quot;, co-writing and singing the song &quot;One Candle&quot;. She also released two more songs from the album, &quot;Bird Set Free&quot; and &quot;One Million Bullets&quot;. &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; and &quot;Reaper&quot; were subsequently released as promotional singles for the album. Eventually, the single &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;, featuring Sean Paul, reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Sia released two videos for the song. One features Ziegler and two male dancers, while the other, featuring Sean Paul, shows a 1950s style teen dance party; it has accumulated more than 1.7 billion views.
In April 2016, Sia gave a widely acclaimed performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival that went viral online. Her performance received an effusively positive critical reception as &quot;one of the greatest moments in Coachella&#x27;s 17-year history&quot;, and it was consistently called one of the best performances of the 2016 festival. The performance was her first full concert since 2011. Sia is an avid fan of the television reality series &quot;Survivor&quot;; in 2016, she made a surprise appearance on the live reunion of &quot;&quot;, where she donated $50,000 to contestant Tai Trang and another $50,000 to an animal charity of his choice, noting that the two share a mutual love of animals. Since then, she has regularly awarded prizes to her favourite contestants from subsequent seasons of &quot;Survivor&quot;.

In June 2016, Sia gave a concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, featuring Ziegler. From May to August, Sia performed in nearly a dozen festivals and other concerts in America and European and Middle Eastern countries, including Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Poland, the United Kingdom, Russia, Lebanon and Israel. In September 2016, she released a single, &quot;The Greatest&quot;, with vocals from American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar. A video was released the same day featuring Ziegler – the dancer&#x27;s fifth video collaboration with Sia and Heffington. The two performed the song with several other dancers, and also performed &quot;Chandelier&quot; live the next day at the Apple annual fall event, drawing media attention. The videos that Sia has posted to her YouTube channel have accumulated a total of more than 12 billion views, and the channel has more than 22 million subscribers.

Sia gave her Nostalgic for the Present Tour in North America from September to November 2016, featuring Ziegler. As at Coachella and subsequent live performances, Sia appeared at the back of the stage with her familiar wig covering her face, while her dancers performed Heffington&#x27;s choreography synchronised with pre-recorded videos played on big screens. The tour received a warm reaction: &quot;She let her dancers own center stage, carrying out one skit/performance after another as Sia delivered the soundtrack. ... It defied all the regular rules of pop concerts, which are usually designed to focus every ounce of the audience&#x27;s attention on the star of the show. Yet, Sia&#x27;s bold gamble paid off, resulting in one of the most daringly original and wholly satisfying shows of 2016.&quot; Ed Masley of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; described the show as &quot;part performance art, part interpretive dance. ... [Sia] sounded amazing. ... There&#x27;s so much raw emotion in her songs. And you can definitely hear that in her voice, but it becomes more visceral when you can also read it in the faces of her dancers, especially Ziegler. ... The entire performance was brilliantly staged, with one song flowing seamlessly into another&quot;. Sia released the deluxe edition of &quot;This Is Acting&quot; in October 2016, which includes three new tracks, a remix version of &quot;Move Your Body&quot; and a solo version of &quot;The Greatest&quot;. She was nominated for three 2017 Grammy Awards. Sia co-wrote and performed on a platinum-selling single, &quot;Dusk Till Dawn&quot;, by Zayn.

Sia performed in concert at the close of the Dubai World Cup in March 2017, together with her dancers, led by Ziegler. They gave a second leg of the Nostalgic for the Present Tour, her first stadium tour in Australasia, in late 2017.

===2017–present: &quot;Everyday Is Christmas&quot;, &quot;LSD&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, and &quot;Reasonable Woman&quot;===
In 2017, Sia moved from RCA to Atlantic Records. She released the album &quot;Everyday Is Christmas&quot; on Atlantic and Monkey Puzzle in November 2017. The album features original songs co-written and co-produced with Kurstin. She promoted it by releasing the singles &quot;Santa&#x27;s Coming for Us&quot; and &quot;Snowman&quot;, the latter of which she performed during the finale of the 13th season of &quot;The Voice&quot; and on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; with Maddie Ziegler. &quot;Snowman&quot; has also since become a modern-day Christmas classic, and is one of the most-streamed Christmas songs of all time. In November 2018, Sia released the deluxe edition of the album, containing three bonus tracks, as a Target exclusive.

In 2018, Sia collaborated with English musician Labrinth and American DJ/record producer Diplo to form the supergroup LSD. They released five singles: &quot;Genius&quot;, &quot;Audio&quot;, &quot;Thunderclouds&quot;, &quot;Mountains&quot;, and &quot;No New Friends&quot;, before releasing their debut album, &quot;Labrinth, Sia &amp; Diplo Present... LSD&quot;, in April 2019. Also in 2018, Sia was one of the narrators of Australian animal rights documentary, &quot;Dominion&quot;, and shared in a 2018 Award of Excellence from the Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards.

Sia&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture&quot;, was released in February 2021 in connection with the release of her film, &quot;Music&quot;. In 2023, Sia released &quot;Gimme Love&quot;, the lead single from her tenth studio album, &quot;Reasonable Woman&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Dance Alone&quot;, a collaboration with Kylie Minogue, released in 2024. The album was released on 3 May 2024. Mark Kennedy wrote, for the Associated Press, &quot;Sia hasn&#x27;t lost a step [in her] ability to switch from hurt and broken (&quot;I Forgive You&quot;) to ecstatic lover (&quot;Towards the Sun&quot;) to vengeful, hell-releasing angel, like on &quot;I Had a Heart&quot;. ... But on this outing, the ... forever catchy Sia is most interesting with others. In addition to the Khan duet, the best songs are &quot;Dance Alone&quot; with Kylie Minogue, &quot;Incredible&quot; with Labrinth and &quot;Fame Won&#x27;t Love You&quot; with Paris Hilton&quot; although he says that Sia &quot;rarely shift[s] out of third gear&quot; on the album. Sia executive produced Paris Hilton&#x27;s 2024 album, &quot;Infinite Icon&quot;.

A musical theatre adaptation of the film &quot;Saturday Church&quot; is set to premiere off-Broadway in late 2025. It has a book by Damon Cardasis and James Ijames and music and lyrics by Sia with additional music by Honey Dijon.

==Artistry and musical style==
At the start of her career, with the band Crisp, Sia performed acid jazz in Australia and later in London. With her first solo single, &quot;Taken for Granted&quot;, she experimented with trip hop. When she joined Zero 7, she sang downtempo numbers.

With &quot;Colour the Small One&quot; (2004) and &quot;Some People Have Real Problems&quot; (2007) she moved into jazz and folktronica, although the album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Breathe Me&quot;, is described as alternative rock and a power ballad. &quot;Some People Have Real Problems&quot; expanded her connection with indie pop. Sia stated, &quot;&quot;Colour the Small One&quot; ... couldn&#x27;t be more derivative of Kings of Convenience and James Taylor and the things that Zero 7 were playing on the [tour] bus. I&#x27;m very easily influenced.&quot;

In 2009, after leaving Zero 7, Sia dedicated herself entirely to her solo career. &quot;We Are Born&quot; (2010), incorporated various pop styles, including synthpop and R&amp;B, with introspective themes accompanied by more insistent and livelier rhythms. &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot; (2014) consolidated her connection with pop (with traces of electropop, reggae and hip-hop), while &quot;This Is Acting&quot; (2016) is mostly composed of songs written by Sia with other female pop artists in mind, but the artists did not include the songs on their albums. Sia described songwriting for others as &quot;play-acting&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Kitty Empire commented that the latter album &quot;provides an obvious counterpoint to Sia&#x27;s more personal album of 2014, &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;, whose stonking single, &quot;Chandelier&quot;, tackled her intoxicated past. &quot;This Is Acting&quot; makes plain the fact of manufacture – a process akin to bespoke tailoring.&quot; The record also alternates reggae and electropop with more introspective themes.

Sia&#x27;s voice has been described as &quot;deep, playful, and powerful&quot;. In her 2016 live performances, Sia&#x27;s music was part of performance-art-like shows that involved dance and theatrical effects. An MTV News writer opined that &quot;Sia&#x27;s throaty, slurred vocals are her norm&quot;, while a contributor to &quot;The Fader&quot; noted that &quot;in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 landscape, Sia&#x27;s songwriting voice, which deals with depression and addiction, is singular—her actual voice even more so.&quot; &quot;Everyday Is Christmas&quot; (2017), Sia&#x27;s first release of Christmas music, is a pop album that gives old-fashioned holiday music &quot;some 21st century pop gloss&quot; and is made for those who grow tired of the classics. &quot;Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture&quot; (2021) further developed Sia&#x27;s pop music catalogue, with the album incorporating more electropop and reggae, alongside R&amp;B and EDM. National Public Radio called Sia &quot;the 21st century&#x27;s most resilient songwriter&quot;.

==Accolades and recognition==
Sia has received an array of accolades, including ARIA Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and nine nominations for Grammy Awards.

In March 2021, a laneway in Adelaide city centre was renamed Sia Furler Lane, and a mural titled &quot;She Imagined Buttons&quot; was painted on a wall nearby to commemorate Sia&#x27;s 2011 performance in Adelaide. As of October 2022, Sia has 15 entries on the APRA billion streams list, the most of any artist.

==Other ventures==
In the 2014 &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;The Cissy&quot;, Sia provided the vocals for the fictional Lorde track &quot;Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)&quot;. In 2016 Sia covered &quot;Blackbird&quot; by The Beatles for the Netflix original series &quot;Beat Bugs&quot;. She appeared in the 2017 animated film &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot; as the voice of pop star Songbird Serenade. She also contributed an original song, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Sia wrote the songs for the soundtrack to the 2018 musical film &quot;Vox Lux&quot;, with a score by Scott Walker.

She wrote a screenplay, based on a story that she had written in 2007, for the 2021 musical film, &quot;Music&quot;, which starred Ziegler, Kate Hudson and Leslie Odom Jr. Sia also directed the film and wrote its soundtrack. The film was released in Australia in January 2021 and in select IMAX theatres in the US for one night on 10 February 2021, followed by an on-demand release. It received negative reviews from critics and generated controversy for its depiction of autism. Sia said after the release of the film and subsequent backlash that she was diagnosed with autism. It was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 78th Golden Globe Awards. As director of &quot;Music&quot;, Sia later won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director.

=== Philanthropy ===
Sia has been noted for her philanthropic gestures over the years. Prior to Thanksgiving in 2019, at a Palm Springs, California, Walmart and TJ Maxx, Sia paid for peoples&#x27; groceries and shopping in disguise. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Sia pledged to donate $1 million to CORE Response; she also donated the proceeds from her single &quot;Saved My Life&quot; to CORE Response&#x27;s and AmeriCares&#x27; relief efforts. The same year she donated $100,000 to Australians in need in collaboration with Nova FM DJs Fitzy &amp; Wippa and another $100,000 to community bail funds in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Since 2016, Sia has given money to her favourite contestants in the reality television series &quot;Survivor&quot;; the tradition has been billed the &quot;Sia Award&quot;. At the end of the 45th season, she had given a total of $1 million to contestants over the years.

=== Animal activism ===
Sia is a vegetarian and an &quot;animal lover&quot;. She has been an advocate for animals throughout her career. In 2010, she participated in a PETA campaign to tackle animal overpopulation and encourage people to spay or neuter their pets. She performed her song &quot;I&#x27;m in Here&quot; at the Beagle Freedom Project Gala in 2013, and, in 2015, &quot;Free the Animal&quot; was used for PETA public service announcements supporting cruelty-free fashion. During her Nostalgic for the Present Tour in 2016, Sia partnered with various animal rescue organisations to set up dog adoption fairs at each of the shows. In 2017, she released another public service announcement, in collaboration with the ASPCA, using her song &quot;Puppies Are Forever&quot;, to encourage pet adoption. Sia co-narrated the 2018 animal rights documentary &quot;Dominion&quot;.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships and family ===
Following the disbandment of Crisp in 1997, Sia moved to London to follow her relationship with boyfriend Dan Pontifex. Several weeks later, while on a stopover in Thailand, she received the news that Pontifex had died after being in a car accident in London. She returned to Australia, but received a call from one of Pontifex&#x27;s former housemates, who invited her to stay in London. Her 2001 album &quot;Healing Is Difficult&quot; lyrically deals with Pontifex&#x27;s death: &quot;I was pretty fucked up after Dan died. I couldn&#x27;t really feel anything.&quot; Sia recalled the effect of his death in a 2007 interview for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;: &quot;We were all devastated, so we got shit-faced on drugs and Special Brew. Unfortunately, that bender lasted six years for me.&quot;

Sia married documentary filmmaker Erik Anders Lang at her home in Palm Springs, California, in August 2014. The couple divorced in 2016. During a 2014 appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Sia was asked if she was religious, to which she responded, &quot;I believe in a higher power and it&#x27;s called &#x27;Whatever Dude&#x27; and he&#x27;s a queer, surfing Santa that&#x27;s a bit like my grandpa, so yes.&quot; In the same interview, she stated that she is a feminist and that Whatever Dude divinely inspired the lyrics she wrote for Rihanna&#x27;s song &quot;Diamonds&quot;. One of Sia&#x27;s tattoos on her hand reads &quot;Whatever Dude&quot;. Sia is a cousin of Australian Christian rock musician Peter Furler.

In 2019, Sia adopted two boys who were ageing out of the foster care system. In 2020, Sia announced that she had become a grandmother when one of her two 19-year-old sons had fathered twins. In 2023, Sia married Dan Bernad in Portofino, Italy.

=== Sexuality ===
In 2008, Sia discussed her sexual orientation in interviews and revealed her relationship with JD Samson; they broke up in 2011. When asked about her sexuality in 2009, she said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always dated boys and girls and anything in between. I don&#x27;t care what gender you are, it&#x27;s about people. ... I&#x27;ve always been... well, flexible is the word I would use.&quot; Sia identified as queer on Twitter in 2013.

=== Health ===
Sia has experienced depression and addictions to painkillers and alcohol. In 2010, she wrote a suicide note, planning to overdose; a friend phoned her and, unintentionally, saved her life. Following this, Sia joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Sia cancelled various promotional events and shows due to her poor health in 2010. She mentioned having extreme lethargy and panic attacks, and considered retiring permanently from performing and touring. Sia also discussed being diagnosed with Graves&#x27; disease. Later that year, she said her health was improving after rest and thyroid suppression therapy.

In 2019, Sia stated that she has Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. She has also stated that she was diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder, stemming from childhood traumas including being sexually abused at the age of nine. Sia said that following the backlash she received regarding her film &quot;Music&quot;, she relapsed, became suicidal again and returned to rehabilitation.

<text>Arthur Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Epp, (born September 1, 1939) is a Canadian executive and former politician.

==Life and career==
Born into a Mennonite family in Manitoba, Epp was a high school history teacher in Steinbach, Manitoba before entering politics. Jake Epp was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1972 election for the riding of Provencher, which was the home of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited&#x27;s Whiteshell Laboratories.

In the wake of the 1977 murder of Emanuel Jaques, Epp wrote to the National Gay Rights Coalition: &quot;I would like to see what kind of support you have now after what has taken place in Toronto. What is needed is not protection for homosexuals, but for Canadians who are not deviant.&quot;

After the 1979 election, he served in the short-lived Cabinet of Joe Clark as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. As a minister, he wrote the &quot;Epp letter&quot;, which instructed the Commissioner of the Yukon to abandon some of her powers and established responsible government in the Yukon. He retained his seat in the 1980 election despite the defeat of the Clark government and returned to the Opposition bench.

When Brian Mulroney led the Conservatives back to power in the 1984 election, he appointed Epp as his Minister of National Health and Welfare. At the Cabinet table, he was a vocal proponent that life begins at conception. In the spring of 1988, the activist organization AIDS Action NOW! burned an effigy of Epp at Toronto City Hall to draw attention to his neglect of the AIDS epidemic.

In 1989, Epp became Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. Epp retired at the 1993 election, and returned to private life. From 1993 until 2000, he was Senior Vice President and Vice President at TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.

Epp was one of the Tories who joined the Canadian Alliance when it was created in an attempt to attract Progressive Conservatives to the former Reform Party of Canada.

The Tory Mike Harris government appointed Epp to head a review of the ongoing cost over-runs and delays that plagued Ontario Power Generation&#x27;s restart of the four &quot;A&quot; reactors at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. The two other panel members were Peter Barnes and Dr. Robin Jeffrey. The review&#x27;s report was released on December 4, 2003, and attributed blame for the project to management problems.

The election of the Ontario Liberal Party in 2003 delayed action on the Epp report. The government of Dalton McGuinty appointed Epp to the Ontario Power Generation Review headed by John Manley to examine the future role of Ontario Power Generation (OPG) in the province’s electricity market, examine its corporate and management structure, and decide whether the public utility should proceed with refurbishing three more nuclear reactors at the Pickering nuclear power plant. The report recommended proceeding with the restart Pickering &quot;A&quot; reactors 1, 2, and 3, sequentially. The report argued that the restart of units 2 and 3 would be contingent on whether &quot;OPG will be able to succeed at the Unit 1 project.&quot;

The McGuinty government accepted the OPG Review Committee&#x27;s recommendation and allowed the restart of reactor 1, which still underwent cost over-runs and delays.
In August 2005, the OPG Board of Directors announced that Units 2 and 3 would not be refurbished due to specific technical and cost risks surrounding the material condition of these two units.

In 2004, the McGuinty government made Epp Chairman of the Board of OPG.

Between 2005 and 2009 Epp served as Chancellor of Tyndale University College and Seminary in Toronto.

In 2010, Epp was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada.

== The AIDS Crisis ==

Jake Epp played a significant role in allowing the AIDS crisis to grow unchecked by continuously ignoring pleas from community organizations to develop and implement a National AIDS Strategy. Beyond invitations for conversation, a blind eye was turned to AIDS activist protests as well. HIV/AID activism in opposition to Jake Epp came to a head when activists from AIDS Action Now! in Toronto called attention to his neglect by burning him in effigy in Nathan Phillips Square. Jake Epp&#x27;s willful ignorance exacerbated the AIDS crisis in Canada and contributed to the growing number of AIDS-related deaths. Despite the desperate need for action, the government made no change until Epp was replaced by Perrin Beatty. Only then was there involvement in HIV-related matters at the federal level in Canada.

<text>Edward Bayzand Ellington (2 August 1845 – 10 November 1914) was a British hydraulic engineer who pioneered the development of urban-scale hydraulic power distribution systems.

Ellington was managing director of the Hydraulic Engineering Co of Chester and one of the founders of the London Hydraulic Power Company. He invented the hydraulic balance lift (US: elevator) and the automatic injector fire hydrant.

==Early life==
The second son of a warehouseman, Ellington was born in Camberwell, and studied at Denmark Hill Grammar School before being articled to the Greenwich-based maritime engineering firm of John Penn in 1862.

In 1869, he left Penn&#x27;s company and London and entered into partnership with Bryan Johnson of Chester; Johnson and Ellington specialised in hydraulic machinery. In 1871, they established the Wharves and Warehouses Steam Power and Hydraulic Pressure Company. In 1875, the partnership converted to a limited company, the Hydraulic Engineering Co.

==Hydraulic power==

Two years later, in 1877, Ellington was engineer to the Hull Hydraulic Power Co., the first company to demonstrate the practicability of large-scale urban hydraulic power networks, in Kingston upon Hull.

In London in 1882, he was consulting engineer to the General Hydraulic Power Company of Southwark (incorporated 29 June), and, in 1884, helped form its subsidiary, the London Hydraulic Power Company, which merged the Wharves and Warehouses Steam Power and Hydraulic Pressure Company and the General Hydraulic Power Company. This was followed by similar UK companies in Liverpool (Liverpool Hydraulic Power Company, 1889), Manchester (Manchester Hydraulic Power, 1894) and Glasgow (1895), plus Australian schemes in Melbourne (1889) and Sydney (1891). The emergence of electrical power during the 20th century meant hydraulic networks were gradually superseded; the Hull company was wound up in 1947 while the final London pumping station ceased operation in 1977.

Late in his life Ellington was elected President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He died at his London home (73 Addison Road, Kensington) on 10 November 1914.

==Family==
Ellington married Marion Florence Leonard, and they had at least one child, a son, Edward Ellington (born in Kensington in 1877), who became a senior figure in the Royal Air Force.

<doc id="875484" wikidata="Q7672623" url="?curid=875484" title="T (programming language)">
<text>T is a dialect of the Scheme programming language developed in the early 1980s by Jonathan A. Rees, Kent M. Pitman, and Norman I. Adams of Yale University as an experiment in language design and implementation.

==Rationale==
T&#x27;s purpose is to test the thesis developed by Guy L. Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman in their series of papers about Scheme: that Scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power, and that implementations of Scheme could perform better than other Lisp systems, and competitively with implementations of programming languages, such as C and BLISS, which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than Lisp on conventional machine architectures. Much of this occurs via an optimizing compiler named Orbit.

T contains some features that modern Scheme lacks. For example, T is object-oriented, and it has first-class environments, called &quot;locales&quot;, which can be modified non-locally and used as a module system. T has several extra special forms for lazy evaluation and flow control, and an equivalent to Common Lisp&#x27;s setf. T, like Scheme, supports call-with-current-continuation (call/cc), but it also has a more limited form called codice_1. From the T manual, a hypothetical implementation of codice_2 could be:
 (define-predicate pair?)
 (define-settable-operation (car pair))
 (define-settable-operation (cdr pair))
 (define (cons the-car the-cdr)
 (object nil
 ((pair? self) t)
 ((car self) the-car)
 ((cdr self) the-cdr)
 (((setter car) self new-car) (set the-car new-car))
 (((setter cdr) self new-cdr) (set the-cdr new-cdr))))
This example shows that objects in T are intimately related to closures and message-passing. A primitive called codice_3 puts two objects together, allowing for something resembling inheritance.

==Ports==
T was ported to many hardware platforms and operating systems, including:

*MIPS: DEC 3100 (pmax), SGI IRIS
*Motorola 68000 (m68k): Apollo Domain/OS, HP/UX, Mac/AUX, NeXT, SunOS 3
*NS320xx (n32k): Encore Multimax
*SPARC: SunOS 4 and above, Solaris, Unix on Connection Machine 5
*VAX: Ultrix

<text>The World War I Victory Medal (known prior to establishment of the World War II Victory Medal in 1945 simply as the Victory Medal) was a United States service medal designed by James Earle Fraser of New York City under the direction of the Commission of Fine Arts.

Award of a common allied service medal was recommended by an inter-allied committee in March 1919. Each allied nation would design a &#x27;Victory Medal&#x27; for award to their military personnel, all issues having certain common features, including a winged figure of victory on the obverse and the same ribbon.

The Victory Medal was originally intended to be established by an act of Congress. The bill authorizing the medal never passed, however, thus leaving the military departments to establish it through general orders. The War Department published orders in April 1919, and the Navy in June of the same year.

==Criteria==
The Victory Medal was awarded to military personnel for service between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918, or with either of the following expeditions:
* American Expeditionary Forces in European Russia between November 12, 1918, and August 5, 1919.
* American Expeditionary Forces Siberia between November 23, 1918, and April 1, 1920.

==Design==
The front of the bronze medal features a winged Victory holding a shield and sword on the front. The back of the bronze medal features &quot;The Great War For Civilization&quot; in all capital letters curved along the top of the medal. Curved along the bottom of the back of the medal are six stars, three on either side of the center column of seven staffs wrapped in a cord. The top of the staff has a round ball on top and is winged on the side. The staff is on top of a shield that says &quot;U&quot; on the left side of the staff and &quot;S&quot; on the right side of the staff. On left side of the staff it lists one World War I Allied country per line: France, Italy, Serbia, Japan, Montenegro, Russia, and Greece. On the right side of the staff the Allied country names read: Great Britain, Belgium, Brazil, Portugal, Rumania (spelled with a U instead of an O as it is spelled now), and China.

==Devices==
To denote battle participation and campaign credit, the World War I Victory Medal was authorized with a large variety of devices to denote specific accomplishments. In order of seniority, the devices authorized to the World War I Victory Medal were as follows:

===Citation Star===
The Citation Star to the World War I Victory Medal was authorized by the United States Congress on February 4, 1919. A inch silver star was authorized to be worn on the ribbon of the Victory Medal for any member of the U.S. Army who had been cited for gallantry in action between 1917 and 1920. In 1932, the Citation Star (&quot;Silver Star&quot;) was redesigned and renamed the Silver Star Medal and, upon application to the United States War Department, any holder of the Silver Star Citation could have it converted to a Silver Star medal.

===Navy Commendation Star===
The Navy Commendation Star to the World War I Victory Medal was authorized to any person who had been commended by the Secretary of the Navy for performance of duty during the First World War. A inch silver star was worn on the World War I Victory Medal, identical in appearance to the Army&#x27;s Citation Star. Unlike the Army&#x27;s version, however, the Navy Commendation Star could not be upgraded to the Silver Star medal.

===Army Battle Clasps===
The following battle clasps, inscribed with a battle&#x27;s name, were worn on the medal to denote participation in major ground conflicts.
For general defense service, not involving a specific battle, the &quot;Defensive Sector&quot; Battle Clasp was authorized. The clasp was also awarded for any battle which was not already recognized by its own battle clasp.

The World War I Victory Medal bears the clasps of the battles the U.S. Army participated in across the ribbon. Not all battles are shown on the bar clasps. Only the battles designated as battles that would have bars issued were shown on the medal. The famous Battle of Chateau Thierry to hold the Chateau and the bridge as a joint effort between the US Army and the US Marines against the German machine gunners did not get awarded clasps.

As commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, General John J. Pershing received all 14 clasps. His medal is in the National Museum of American History.

===Navy Battle Clasps===
Navy battle clasps were issued for naval service in support of Army operations and had identical names to the Army battle clasps. There was a slight variation of the criteria dates for the Navy battle clasps, as listed below.
The Defensive Sector Clasp was also authorized for Navy personnel who had participated in naval combat but were not authorized a particular battle clasp.

===Navy Operational Clasps===
For sea-related war duty, the Navy issued the following operational clasps, which were worn on the World War I Victory Medal and inscribed with the name of the duty type which had been performed. Clasps for Navy and Marine Corps personnel are rectangular bronze bars with a stylized rope border measuring 1/4 x 1 1/2 inches.
Unlike the army, the navy only allowed one clasp of any type to be worn on the ribbon. Members of the marine or medical corps who served in France but was not eligible for a battle clasp would receive a bronze Maltese cross on their ribbons.

===Army Service Clasps===
For non-combat service with the army during the First World War, the following service clasps were authorized to be worn with the World War I Victory Medal. Each service clasp was inscribed with a country or region name where support service was performed. The U.S. Army issued the following service clasps:
===Navy Service Clasps===
The U.S. Navy issued similar service clasps to the Army for service in the following regions during the following periods:
===Campaign Stars===

Since battle and service clasps could only be worn on the full-sized World War I Victory Medal, 3/16 inch bronze service stars were authorized for wear on the award ribbon. This was the common method of campaign and battle display when wearing the World War I Victory Medal as a ribbon on a military uniform.

===Maltese Cross===
Medals issued to U.S. Marines were issued with a Maltese cross device affixed to the ribbon.

==Lapel button==
The World War I Victory Button (known prior to establishment of the World War II Victory Medal simply as the Victory Button) was a lapel button designed for wear on civilian clothes and consisted of a five-pointed star 5/8-inch in diameter on a wreath with the letters &quot;U.S.&quot; in the center. For persons wounded in action, the lapel button was silver; for all others, the lapel button was bronze. The Victory Button was designed by the sculptor, Adolph Alexander Weinman of New York City under the supervision of the Commission of Fine Arts.

The World War I Victory Button on a narrow circular band of blue enamel, containing the words &quot;American Legion&quot; in gold letters, forms the central element of the American Legion emblem. It was adopted by the National Executive Committee of the American Legion on July 9, 1919, as the official insignia of the national organization of American veterans.

==Distribution==

The World War I Victory Medals were awarded after the end of World War I, so they were mailed to the servicemen instead of awarded in person. For example, the boxes containing the Victory Medals for United States Army World War I veterans were mailed out by the depot officer at the General Supply Depot, U.S. Army, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in April 1921. An outer light brown box with an address label glued to it and its postage area marked &quot;OFFICIAL BUSINESS, Penalty for private use $300&quot; contained an inner white box stamped with the bars the serviceman was supposed to receive on his medal. The inner white box contained the medal, which was wrapped in tissue paper.

Only after filling out the application form A.G.O. No. 740 with the help of an authorized officer could it be officially forwarded to the Philadelphia Quartermaster Intermediate Depot for the veteran then to receive his medal by mail. The Army started issuing Victory Medals on June 21, 1920, not April 1921 as listed above. The Navy had a late start due to production issues and started in August 1920.

==Allied and associated nations==
Not only did the United States establish a World War I Victory Medal, but so did a significant number of allied and associated nations involved in the conflict against the Dual Alliance between Austria and Germany. The proposition of such a common award was first made by French Maréchal Ferdinand Foch who was supreme commander of the Allied Forces during the First World War. Each bronze Victory Medal has the same diameter (36 mm) and ribbon (double rainbow), but with a national design representing a winged victory.

<doc id="875492" wikidata="Q284146" url="?curid=875492" title="Tennantite">
<text>Tennantite is a copper arsenic sulfosalt mineral with an ideal formula . Due to variable substitution of the copper by iron and zinc the formula is . It is gray-black, steel-gray, iron-gray or black in color. A closely related mineral, tetrahedrite ) has antimony substituting for arsenic and the two form a solid solution series. The two have very similar properties and is often difficult to distinguish between tennantite and tetrahedrite. Iron, zinc, and silver substitute up to about 15% for the copper site.

The mineral was first described for an occurrence in Cornwall, England in 1819, where it occurs as small crystals of cubic or dodecahedral form, and was named after the English chemist Smithson Tennant (1761–1815).
It is found in hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic deposits in association with other Cu–Pb–Zn–Ag sulfides and sulfosalts, pyrite, calcite, dolomite, siderite, barite, fluorite and quartz.

The arsenic component of tennantite causes the metal smelted from the ore to be harder than that of pure copper, because it is a copper-arsenic alloy. In the later 20th century, it was found that arsenical coppers had been more widely used in antiquity than had been previously realised, and it has been proposed that discoveries made by smelting ores like tennantite were significant steps in the progress towards the Bronze Age.

<text>Clougha Pike ( ) is a hill in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England. From the west it looms over the Conder Valley, the city of Lancaster and Lancaster University. It is visible from as far away as Barrow-in-Furness, South Lakeland mountains such as the Old Man of Coniston, and Blackpool Tower. From the west, it appears to be a large dome shape, with a cliff-like section at the very top. From the south-west, a series of notches or cloughs are visible in its flanks, giving the hill its distinctive name. The notches vary in size and run across the side of the hillside, but not down it. The largest notch has had part of its floor filled in by a small lake and swamp and is a dramatic gritstone boulder-strewn feature. These notches are thought to have been cut by meltwater flowing south-west from the area of Littledale, along the side of a glacier which occupied the Quernmore valley. They are known as marginal notch channels and are among the best examples of these features in Britain.

Clougha can be reached from the west, by a pleasant path that travels up its slopes by Rowton (spelt variously) Brook and then diagonally up the final steep broken rock section. It can also be reached from the east from Grit Fell, over boggy land along a muddy path that is sometimes difficult to distinguish. An approach from the north, from the direction of Caton, is also possible. A small car park is also available close to Clougha Pike, just off Rigg Lane. Another starting point to ascend Clougha is from the Victorian folly of Jubilee Tower, where there is also a car park.

Its summit furniture includes an Ordnance Survey trig point and two rock wind shelters. The view west from the top is over Morecambe Bay. On a clear day views from Clougha Pike extend to Snowdonia, the Ribble Estuary, the Isle of Man (directly behind Barrow-in-Furness), the fells of the Lake District and many of the Pennine hills. Very rarely, the Mourne Mountains can be seen to the south of the Isle of Man.

Clougha Pike was one of the lowest of the 100 hills included in &quot;Trail&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2007 list of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Greatest Mountains&quot;.

<doc id="875509" wikidata="Q1677714" url="?curid=875509" title="Jacobi field">
<text>In Riemannian geometry, a Jacobi field is a vector field along a geodesic formula_1 in a Riemannian manifold describing the difference between the geodesic and an &quot;infinitesimally close&quot; geodesic. In other words, the Jacobi fields along a geodesic form the tangent space to the geodesic in the space of all geodesics. They are named after Carl Jacobi.

==Definitions and properties==

Jacobi fields can be obtained in the following way: Take a smooth one parameter family of geodesics formula_2 with formula_3, then 
:formula_4
is a Jacobi field, and describes the behavior of the geodesics in an infinitesimal neighborhood of a 
given geodesic formula_1.

A vector field &quot;J&quot; along a geodesic formula_1 is said to be a Jacobi field if it satisfies the Jacobi equation:
:formula_7
where &quot;D&quot; denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the Levi-Civita connection, &quot;R&quot; the Riemann curvature tensor, formula_8 the tangent vector field, and &quot;t&quot; is the parameter of the geodesic.
On a complete Riemannian manifold, for any Jacobi field there is a family of geodesics formula_2 describing the field (as in the preceding paragraph).

The Jacobi equation is a linear, second order ordinary differential equation;
in particular, values of formula_10 and formula_11 at one point of formula_1 uniquely determine the Jacobi field. Furthermore, the set of Jacobi fields along a given geodesic forms a real vector space of dimension twice the dimension of the manifold.

As trivial examples of Jacobi fields one can consider formula_13 and formula_14. These correspond respectively to the following families of reparametrizations: formula_15 and formula_16.

Any Jacobi field formula_10 can be represented in a unique way as a sum formula_18, where formula_19 is a linear combination of trivial Jacobi fields and formula_20 is orthogonal to formula_13, for all formula_22. 
The field formula_23 then corresponds to the same variation of geodesics as formula_10, only with changed parametrizations.

==Motivating example==

On a unit sphere, the geodesics through the North pole are great circles. Consider two such geodesics formula_25 and formula_2 with natural parameter, formula_27, separated by an angle formula_28. The geodesic distance 
:formula_29 
is 
:formula_30 
Computing this requires knowing the geodesics. The most interesting information is just that
:formula_31, for any formula_28. 
Instead, we can consider the derivative with respect to formula_28 at formula_34:
:formula_35 
Notice that we still detect the intersection of the geodesics at formula_36. Notice further that to calculate this derivative we do not actually need to know 
:formula_29, 
rather, all we need do is solve the equation 
:formula_38, 
for some given initial data. 

Jacobi fields give a natural generalization of this phenomenon to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds.

==Solving the Jacobi equation==

Let formula_39 and complete this to get an orthonormal basis formula_40 at formula_41. Parallel transport it to get a basis formula_42 all along formula_1. 
This gives an orthonormal basis with formula_44. The Jacobi field can be written in co-ordinates in terms of this basis as formula_45 and thus
:formula_46 
and the Jacobi equation can be rewritten as a system
:formula_47 
for each formula_48. This way we get a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). 
Since this ODE has smooth coefficients we have that solutions exist for all formula_22 and are unique, given formula_50 and formula_51, for all formula_48.

==Examples==
Consider a geodesic formula_53 with parallel orthonormal frame formula_54, formula_55, constructed as above.
* The vector fields along formula_1 given by formula_57 and formula_58 are Jacobi fields.
* In Euclidean space (as well as for spaces of constant zero sectional curvature) Jacobi fields are simply those fields linear in formula_22.
*For Riemannian manifolds of constant negative sectional curvature formula_60, any Jacobi field is a linear combination of formula_13, formula_14 and formula_63, where formula_64.
*For Riemannian manifolds of constant positive sectional curvature formula_65, any Jacobi field is a linear combination of formula_13, formula_14, formula_68 and formula_69, where formula_64.
*The restriction of a Killing vector field to a geodesic is a Jacobi field in any Riemannian manifold.

<text>In mechanical engineering, an eccentric is a circular disk (&quot;eccentric sheave&quot;) solidly fixed to a rotating axle with its centre offset from that of the axle (hence the word &quot;&quot;, out of the center).

It is used most often in steam engines, and used to convert rotary motion into linear reciprocating motion to drive a sliding valve or pump ram. To do so, an eccentric usually has a groove at its circumference closely fitted a circular collar (&quot;eccentric strap&quot;). An attached &quot;eccentric rod&quot; is suspended in such a way that its other end can impart the required reciprocating motion. A return crank fulfills the same function except that it can only work at the end of an axle or on the outside of a wheel whereas an eccentric can also be fitted to the body of the axle between the wheels. Unlike a cam, which also converts rotary into linear motion at almost any rate of acceleration and deceleration, an eccentric or return crank can only impart an approximation of simple harmonic motion.

==On bicycles==
The term is also used to refer to the device often used on tandem bicycles with timing chains, single-speed bicycles with a rear disc brake or an internal-geared hub, or any bicycle with vertical dropouts and no derailleur, to allow slight repositioning, fore and aft, of a bottom bracket to properly tension the chain.

They may be held in place by a built-in wedge, set screws threaded into the bottom bracket shell, or pinch bolts that tighten a split bottom bracket shell. As a standard sized bottom bracket threads into the eccentric, an oversized bottom bracket shell is required to accommodate the eccentric.

<text>Isaac Bickerstaffe or Bickerstaff (26 September 1733 – after 1808) was an Irish playwright and librettist.

==Early life==

Isaac John Bickerstaff was born in Dublin, on 26 September 1733, where his father John Bickerstaff held a government position overseeing the construction and management of sports fields including bowls and tennis courts. The office was abolished in 1745, and he received a pension from the government for the rest of his life.

In his early years, Isaac was a page to Lord Chesterfield, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, which allowed him to mix with fashionable Dublin society. When Chesterfield was replaced in the position in 1745 he arranged for Isaac to be given a commission in the army. In October 1745, Bickerstaff joined the 5th Regiment of Foot known as the Northumberland Fusiliers. He served as an Ensign until 1746, when he was promoted to Lieutenant. The regiment, under the command of Alexander Irwin, was on the Irish Establishment and was based in Kinsale in Ireland. In March 1755, the regiment was moved to Bristol in England. Having recently come into some money, Isaac resigned his commission in August and went on half-pay.

He intended to become a writer, but his first work was published but not performed and he soon ran into financial difficulties. By March 1758, he was so short of money that he joined the Marine Corps as a lieutenant stationed at Plymouth and served through the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1763, following the Treaty of Paris he was honourably discharged as the Corps was reduced in size.

==Success==
Bickerstaff had first arrived in London in 1755 and worked as a playwright. His years growing up in Dublin, a cultural hub at the time, had greatly influenced his views on writing and the arts. He developed a view that the English language was totally unsuited for singing operas in, however skilled the composer, and that Italian was the natural language. Later in life, he was to challenge this view.

In London he initially struggled, and his first work &quot;Leucothoé&quot; (1756), a dramatic poem, was a failure. While critically well received by two reviewers, it had not been set to music and performed and was widely ignored. Bickerstaff also hurt his chances of success by publicly criticising David Garrick, the leading actor-manager of the era, for &quot;barbarity&quot; in his recent attempts to set Shakespeare plays to music. These setbacks forced him to return to military service.

In 1760, while still serving in the marine corps, Bickerstaff collaborated with Thomas Arne, the leading British composer, on a light opera &quot;Thomas and Sally&quot; which was an enormous success. It is possible that Bickerstaff simply wrote the play and approached Arne with it or sent it to the Covent Garden Theatre where he was working. It had its opening night at Covent Garden on 28 November 1760. The play was performed repeatedly in London and soon spread around Britain and across the British Empire. It was also performed in Dublin, Philadelphia and Kingston, Jamaica. They subsequently worked together on &quot;Judith&quot;, an oratorio first performed at Drury Lane in February 1760. He went on to produce many successful comedies based on Marivaux and other French playwrights and opera librettos.

In 1762 he and Arne wrote &quot;Love in a Village&quot;, considered the first English comic opera.

His &quot;The Maide of the Mill&quot; (1765), with music by Samuel Arnold and others, was also very successful. Bickerstaffe also wrote bowdlerised versions of plays by William Wycherley and Pedro Calderon de la Barca. His &quot;Love in the City&quot; (1767), &quot;The Padlock&quot; (1768), based on &quot;The Jealous Husband&quot; in Cervantes&#x27; Novelas (this included the character Mungo, a negro servant played by Dibdin, one of the earliest comic black roles in English drama). He also wrote &quot;The Life of Ambrose Guinet&quot; (1770).

==Exile==
In 1770, a newspaper published a false report that in a fit of despair, he had thrown himself into the sea in the south of France, and perished.

In 1772, Bickerstaffe fled to the Continent, suspected of homosexuality. The actor-producer David Garrick was implicated in the scandal by the lampoon &quot;Love in the Suds&quot; by William Kenrick. The remainder of his life seems to have been passed in penury and misery, but little is known.

However, in March 1772, it was reported that he was writing a small piece, which was to be called the &quot;Coterie,&quot; and would be performed at the Haymarket theatre that summer.

In early August 1772, it was reported that &quot;Bickerstaff...who lately absconded for a detestable crime, died miserably a few days ago in Sussex&quot;. However this again appears to have been a false report, as records indicate he was still receiving his army half pay in 1808. &quot;It seems he may have died soon after this.&quot;

Long after Bickerstaffe&#x27;s disappearance, his colleague Charles Dibdin was frequently accused of plagiarising his songs.

<text>Grit Fell is a lonely hill between Clougha Pike and Ward&#x27;s Stone in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England. Covered by heather and large bogs, it is difficult walking country. The path from Jubilee Tower car park in the south is difficult and treacherous, with sheer-sided bogs deep. The path from Clougha Pike in the west is better, but still contains bogs crossed by the odd plank of wood. The path from Ward&#x27;s Stone is the most treacherous of all. Crossing Cabin Flat, it weaves its way across hidden pools of stagnant water, the presence of which is betrayed by a form of red grass.

The summit is fairly inconspicuous, with only cairns and a wall.

<text>Christian von Ehrenfels (; born Maria Christian Julius Leopold [[Freiherr]] von Ehrenfels; 20 June 1859 – 8 September 1932) was an Austrian philosopher, and is known as one of the founders and precursors of Gestalt psychology.

==Early life==
Christian von Ehrenfels was born on 20 June 1859 in Rodaun near Vienna and grew up at his father&#x27;s castle Brunn am Walde in Lower Austria. He joined secondary school in Krems and first studied at the Hochschule für Bodenkultur in Vienna and then changed to the University of Vienna.

There he studied philosophy, was a pupil of Franz Brentano and Alexius Meinong, promoted under the supervision of Meinong, following him after his move to the Karl-Franzens-Universität (in Graz), in 1885 on the topic of &quot;Größenrelationen und Zahlen. Eine psychologische Studie&quot; (&quot;Relations of magnitude and numbers. A psychological study&quot;). He obtained his habilitation in 1888 in Vienna with the work &quot;Über Fühlen und Wollen&quot; (&quot;On feeling and willing&quot;). From 1896 to 1929 he was a professor of philosophy at the German University of Prague. Interested in his lectures were among others Max Brod, Franz Kafka and Felix Weltsch.

==Gestalt psychology==
The idea of &quot;Gestalt&quot; has its roots in theories of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Ernst Mach. Max Wertheimer is to be credited as the founder of the movement of &quot;Gestalt&quot; psychology. The concept of &quot;Gestalt&quot; itself was first introduced in contemporary philosophy and psychology by Ehrenfels in his famous work &quot;Über Gestaltqualitäten&quot; (&quot;On the Qualities of Form&quot;, 1890). Both he and Edmund Husserl seem to have been inspired by Mach&#x27;s work &quot;Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the Analysis of the Sensations&quot;, 1886) to formulate their very similar concepts of &quot;Gestalt&quot; and Figural Moment respectively. Ehrenfels&#x27; &quot;Gestaltqualitaten&quot; also influenced Stephan Witasek&#x27;s investigations on complexion theory.

His analysis of the transition of a melody to another key became famous. Ehrenfels explained that a melody consists of individual sounds, but that it is considerably more than the sum of these notes. The individual notes would be able to join themselves for completely different melodies, while the melody would remain the same, if transposed into another key and containing single tones. This new opinion, that came up to a “perception of the whole” compared to its “parts” Ehrenfels called &quot;Gestaltqualitäten&quot; (&quot;Figure qualities&quot;).

Compare with: Aristotle (trans. 1952) “In the case of all things that have several parts and in which the whole is not like a heap, but is a particular something besides the parts, there must be some such uniting factor”.

==Monogamy and polygamy==
Ehrenfels argued in numerous cultural-scientific and sexual-political writings against the cultural harmfulness of monogamy and for the utopia of a polygynian social order. He defended the opinion that monogamy would hinder a Darwinistic reproduction-logic and procreation-selection, which would have a devastating effect on society in a cultural-biological way and therefore monogamy should be combated. With those theories, Ehrenfels exposed himself to massive criticism, because he offered with his theories unimaginable thoughts to contemporary Western conventions. The basis of Ehrenfels&#x27;s thinking about a new sexual order were expressed in a series of essays published in several academic journals in Germany and Austria between 1902 and 1910. In his essays, Ehrenfels began with the argument that men are not naturally monogamous, and that monogamy was something that had come to Europe with Christianity. Ehrenfels&#x27;s starting point was that with many species of animals such as whales, walruses, elephants, lions, etc., the strongest male has a harem, which for him was sufficient proof that this was what nature had intended for humanity. Ehrenfels stated that though monogamy had some useful functions such as the &quot;iron discipline&quot; it imposed on European men, on the whole Europeans had suffered terribly from the unnatural condition of monogamy, which had seriously interfered with the Darwinian progress of ensuring the survival of the fittest (Ehrenfels was an avid Social Darwinist). Ehrenfels believed polygamy was what nature had intended for men as it allowed the &quot;fittest&quot; men to father as many children as possible with as many women as possible in a process of &quot;virile selection&quot;.

Ehrenfels wrote with disgust that monogamy was &quot;that type of sexual life...that corresponded to the needs and capacities of women, at the cost of men&quot;. By contrast, Ehrenfels believed that women were naturally monogamous, and that all that women desired was one good husband to look after them. Ehrenfels further believed that all social problems were caused by an unnatural state of Christian monogamy, which caused a &quot;splitting&quot; between a man&#x27;s &quot;day consciousness&quot; when he professed to believe in Christian marriage, and his &quot;night consciousness&quot;, when a man&#x27;s naturally aggressive, animistic sex drive come into play. Ehrenfels argued that this &quot;splitting&quot; within men between their &quot;day consciousness&quot; and &quot;night consciousness&quot; caused men all sorts of psychological trauma, and led to men acting in irrational, often violent ways. The specific example of the sort of male irrationality brought up by Enrenfels concerning this &quot;splitting&quot; was that of men abusing the prostitutes they visited.

Additionally, Ehrenfels argued this psychological &quot;splitting&quot; led to men to treat their wives badly as men were forced into the unnatural condition of monogamy, and that the feminist movement and the entire &quot;Women&#x27;s Question&quot; had arisen as a response; Enrenfels believed the &quot;Women&#x27;s Question&quot; would naturally resolve itself if only husbands would learn to treat their wives better. Finally, Ehrenfels argued that the monogamy was at the root to the &quot;Social Question&quot; (by which meant Ehrenfels meant the rise of the Austrian Social Democratic Party) as it encouraged men to leave their fortunes to their children, something that Ehrenfels believed to be natural, but also something that &quot;very often contradicts the demands of social justice&quot;. As a result of wealth being spread by &quot;privilegistic&quot; means as opposed to &quot;meritocratic&quot; means, the poor felt resentment and were voting for socialist parties, which promised to abolish inequality. Ehrenfels believed that humanity was naturally unequal, and the demand for universal human equality had to be fought as it is totally unnatural. In a 1908 essay, the proud aristocrat Baron von Ehrenfels called the demand for universal equality in the Austrian Empire being made by the Social Democrats &quot;preposterous&quot;.

==Yellow Peril==
Moreover, Ehrenfels was obsessed with the fear of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, and believed that Asian peoples were a deadly threat to European civilization. Ehrenfels wrote if nothing was done to stop the rise of China, that &quot;if there is no change in current practice, this will lead to the annihilation of the white race by the yellow race&quot;.

In April 1895, the German Emperor Wilhelm II had a nightmare where all the nations of Europe appeared as &quot;prehistoric warrior goddesses&quot; who were protected by Germany which took the form of the Archangel Michael. To the East, they were threatened by a dark, stormy cloud in which a Chinese-style dragon carried a Buddha wreathed in fire under which marched millions of Asians who destroyed all in their path, killing all whites. After his nightmare, which Wilhelm regarded as a message from God about the coming, apocalyptic great &quot;race war&quot; between Europe and Asia which would decide the future of the 20th century, he had a painting of his nightmare done by his court painter Hermann Knackfuss in September 1895. The painting, which was known as the Yellow Peril painting was very popular in its time. Ehrenfels saw the Yellow Peril painting in December 1895 and was greatly impressed. From 1895 onwards, Ehrenfels was greatly influenced by the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; propaganda put out by the German government, in which Wilhelm repeatedly warned of the alleged Asian menace to the West. As a Wagnerite who deeply involved in the various Wagner societies in Vienna, Ehrenfels got to know Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, the German ambassador to Austria-Hungary and an anti-Asian racist who promoted the fear of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; to anybody who would listen. In this viewpoint, to protect European civilization white men would have to wage a &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;primordial&quot; racial war against the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, which justified both white supremacy and male supremacy. The same sort of language and imagery was always frequently invoked with the fears about a &quot;race war&quot; with the blacks and the Jews. European racists often considered the Jews to be a race apart from the rest of humanity, and so the Jews were lumped in with the blacks and the Asians.

Ehrenfels believed that Asians were especially dangerous enemies of the Europeans because in East Asia, polygamy was accepted as a natural part of the social order. Ehrenfels warned that this process of &quot;socially victorious&quot; Chinese men taking as many wives as possible was ultimately a grave threat to the West. As a result of polygamy, genetically superior Asian men were fathering as many children as possible with as many women as possible while genetically superior European men were fathering children by only one woman. As a result of European monogamy and Asian polygamy, the Europeans were losing out to the Asians, and it was only a matter of time before this genetic edge allowed the Asians to destroy European civilization. As a Social Darwinist and a philosopher thereof, Ehrenfels saw all history as an endless racial struggle with the fittest &quot;races&quot; surviving. Ehrenfels took it for granted that the whites and Asians were natural enemies, and always would be. In Ehrenfels&#x27;s viewpoint, the fact that Chinese were capable of working hard while eating less than Europeans were an important sign that the Asian &quot;race&quot; was thanks to polygamy was starting become the stronger &quot;tougher race&quot;. Ehrenfels wrote with alarm that: &quot;the average constitutional strength of the Chinese, their resistance to overwork and...noxious and prejudicial influences of all kinds...exceeds that of the civilized peoples of the West to an astonishing degree&quot;. Ehrenfels warned that it this progress was allowed to continue, then the &quot;beautiful Aryan race&quot; to whom Ehrenfels compared to &quot;clear mountain streams&quot; and &quot;purest white milk&quot; would be swept away by the Asian &quot;torrents of mud&quot;. Ehrenfels stated that racist anti-Asian immigrant laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States were a good first step, but were insufficient to stop the rise of the &quot;tough, fecund Mongol race&quot;.

==Ehrenfels&#x27;s &quot;solution&quot;==
Ehrenfels proposed solution was to do away with monogamy, and create a new social order based on polygamy. To begin with, the state would take complete control of human sexuality. In Ehrenfels&#x27;s new society, the &quot;highest goal&quot; would the &quot;improvement of the human constitution&quot; by allowing only the fittest white men to breed. In Ehrenfels&#x27;s new society, only those white men who proved themselves to be social &quot;winners&quot; would be allowed to marry, and the number of wives a man could have would be based upon his degree of success. The more successful the man, the more wives he would have. The state would assign a man his wives after determining his social success and other features such as health, looks, morality and intelligence. Woman by contrast would be allowed only one husband at a time. All women would be forced to live in communal barracks at the expense of the state, where they would help other each raise their children and where their husbands would visit for sex. In this proposed new society, romantic love would be done away with, and relations between men and women would be only sexual. Ehrenfels maintained in his new society that henceforward only the &quot;specifically sexual element&quot; in relations between the sexes would matter and other &quot;motives alien to breeding&quot; like romantic love would done away with in order to improve the white race. Ehrenfels argued that what men and women both really wanted were those &quot;days and nights of great and insatiable longing and desire&quot;, so in this new society with no &quot;trivialities&quot; like romantic love to interference with the business of sex would be a great improvement for both sexes.

For men who were &quot;social losers&quot;, a certain number of the genetically less fit women would be sterilized and turned into the &quot;courtesan class&quot; who would be set aside for the sexual use of the &quot;loser&quot; men in brothels. Since in Ehrenfels&#x27;s viewpoint, all that men really wanted from women was sex, not love, in this new society men would not suffer the psychological problems caused by monogamy, thus ending the &quot;splitting&quot;. Since this new society would be meritocratic, this would solve the entire &quot;Social Question&quot; as there would no more inherited wealth and privilege. Furthermore, in this new society, women living in their communal barracks would help each other with raising children, so women would have more time for leisure, and as such Ehrenfels believed that women would come to see this new society as a huge improvement over the previous monogamist society. Their husbands now free of monogamy would treat them better, and so the entire &quot;Women&#x27;s Question&quot; would dissolve as women would lose interest in feminism (which Enrenfels saw as very unnatural). To end the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; once and for all, Ehrenfels suggested that the &quot;white nations&quot; band together to conquer all the Asian nations before it was too late, and create a new world racial order with a hereditary, racially determined &quot;caste system&quot;. In Ehrenfels&#x27;s vision, whites would serve as the oligarchic &quot;Aryan&quot; military and intellectual castes and the Asians and blacks as the slave castes supporting the whites. Ehrenfels in essays published in 1903 and 1904 that in this industrial age, where the majority of humanity was doomed to spend their lives in &quot;mindless, indeed mind-numbing mechanical labor&quot;, that this sort of work was best done by &quot;regressive types&quot; of people instead of &quot;human types of higher value&quot;. Ehrenfels argued that Asians and blacks were the &quot;regressive types&quot; born for lives of mindless labor while whites were the types of &quot;higher value&quot; meant for creative thinking, so the division of labor he proposed for his caste system was the one that best suited the intellectual capabilities of the different races that would create the &quot;proper relationship&quot; between them. To prevent Miscegenation, interracial sex would be a capital crime with offenders to be publicly hanged. The American historian Richard Weikart wrote Ehrenfels was typical of the &quot;progress through racial extermination&quot; school of thought that characterized much of the academia in the German-speaking world in the first part of the 20th century, writing that: &quot;Through Ehrenfels was not explicit on this point, presumably the elevation of the Europeans he desired would lead to the annihilation of the East Asians, as well as the other races, whom Ehrenfels considered far inferior to the Europeans. 
Until the Russian-Japanese War of 1904-05, Ehrenfels believed that these sort of radical changes would only happen sometime in the far-future, or as Ehrenfels put it in 1902: &quot;the Aryan will only respond to the imperative of sexual reform when the waves of the Mongolian tide are lapping around his neck&quot;. After Japan&#x27;s victory over Russia in 1905, Ehrenfels wrote &quot;the absolute necessity of a radical sexual reform for the continued existence of the western races of men has... been raised from the level of discussion to the level of a scientifically proven fact&quot;. In a 1907 essay, Ehrenfels wrote that radical sexual reform was &quot;now a question of &#x27;to be or not to be&#x27;...We have no time to lose.&quot; Ehrenfels suggested as a starting point, the Austrian government begin to allow soldiers upon completing their military service to have polygamous marriages, with those soldiers who proven themselves especially intelligent, brave and physically fit to have the largest number of wives. Subsequently, Ehrenfels made a public appeal to &quot;manly Aryan men&quot; who had proved themselves to be both &quot;social winners&quot; and &quot;studs&quot; to disregard monogamy and marriage, and to start impregnating as many women as possible to give the &quot;white race&quot; a genetic edge in the coming war against the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. Before the Russian-Japanese war, it has been the Chinese who had personified the Asian threat to Ehrenfels; after the war, the Asian enemy of the future was the Japanese. In his essays in 1907–1908, Ehrenfels wrote that the Chinese lacked &quot;all potentialities...determination, initiative, productivity, invention and organizational talent&quot;. While the Chinese were now a listless mass of allegedly mindless Asians, Ehrenfels wrote that Japan was &quot;a first-rate military power&quot;, and should the Japanese conquer the Chinese, the Japanese would engage in selective breeding to create a race of &quot;healthy, sly, cunning coolies, virtuosos of reproduction&quot; in China. Once that happened, Ehrenfels warned that a vast Sino-Japanese army would set to conquer the world consisting of genetically superior soldiers whom the Western powers would be unable to stop.

==Public acceptance==
Ehrenfels&#x27;s ideas were not widely accepted by the public, but the very fact that he was allowed to publish essays on his new society in intellectually prestigious, learned academic journals in Germany and Austria shows that his ideas were part of the intellectual mainstream in the first years of the 20th century. Both Alfred Ploetz of &quot;Archiv für Rassen-und Gesellschaftbiologie&quot;, the journal for the widely respected Society for Race Hygiene, and Max Marcuse of the sexologist journal &quot;Sexual-Probleme&quot;, endorsed Ehrenfels&#x27;s plans for a new society. Social Darwinism and racism were part of the intellectual mainstream in the West, as was the widespread belief that white men were starting to become &quot;soft&quot;, and if white men continued to lose their masculine &quot;hardness&quot; inevitably this would lead to process of &quot;racial degeneration&quot;, which would end with the whites becoming enslaved to the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. The early 20th century saw what the historian Jonathan Katz called the &quot;invention of heterosexuality&quot;, by which he meant that the ideal of romantic &quot;true love&quot; was discarded in popular discourse for the first time by a new discourse that celebrated sexuality and carnal pleasure as the objectives of relationships. Ehrnefels&#x27;s opposition to romantic love and his unabashed celebration of sexual pleasure as part of the evolutionary duties of racial improvement fitted in well to the new age. Katz noted that those who saw sexual desires as the core of relationships between men and women almost always justified this with reference to human &quot;need&quot;, &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;instinct&quot; to pass on their genes.

==Opposition==
However, Ehrenfels&#x27;s ideas did meet with disagreement. In December 1908, Sigmund Freud invited Ehrenfels to give a lecture on his proposed new society. The audience generally offered polite dissent from Ehrenfels with one participant calling his new society an &quot;adolescent sexual fantasy&quot;. Ehrenfels&#x27;s proposed new society earned him criticism from the Catholic Church which objected to his attacks on Christian monogamy; from feminists who were offended by his idea that women should be kept essentially as chattels and treated as sex objects by men; and from the romantics everywhere who were upset about his plans to abolish romantic love. The German feminist Helene Stöcker protested against Ehrenfels&#x27;s plans, albeit from the same social Darwinian viewpoint, writing: &quot;A sexual ethic that does not rest on the development of women as a personality, but instead regards her merely as an object of male lust, is absolutely counter-evolutionary&quot;.

The American historian Edward Ross Dickinson wrote the &quot;pieces&quot; of Ehrenfels&#x27;s thinking were all mainstream, but the way he brought them together was &quot;idiosyncratic&quot;. Dickinson suggested that these ideas were rooted in Ehrenfels&#x27;s own tormented sexuality as he was both fascinated/repulsed by sex. Ehrenfels had been brought up in an extremely conservative, sexually repressive Roman Catholic family, and from his teenage years onwards, always felt deep shame and guilt about his sexual desires. Despite his obsession with sex, Ehrenfels was enraged by pornography (which he wanted to see ruthlessly stamped out) and by the &quot;indecent&quot; popular culture of Vienna, which he saw as far too sexualized. Ehrenfels was especially offended by the &quot;Animierkneipen&quot; (&quot;hostess bar&quot;), a type of popular bar in Austria where the buxom waitresses wore very low-cut dresses and were encouraged to flirt with the male customers in order to get them to buy more drinks; in the &quot;Animierkneipen&quot;, the waitresses were paid commissions based on their nightly sales of alcohol. Ehrenfels was deeply disgusted by the sight of what he considered to be women flaunting their sexuality to manipulate men, and wanted the &quot;Animierkneipen&quot; banned. Besides that, Ehrenfels complained constantly about &quot;indecent puns&quot; used by ordinary people, the &quot;courtesan style&quot; in modern fashion and by the &quot;pornography of the humorous weeklies, in comic songs, farces and operettas&quot;.

Dickinson wrote that when Ehrenfels wrote about men suffering from what he called the &quot;tortuously shackled animal personality&quot; created by monogamy, he was almost certainly writing about himself. Dickinson suggested that based upon a reading of Ehrenfels&#x27;s private letters his concerns about psychological &quot;splitting&quot; within men were based upon his own visits to prostitutes, where he saw johns abusing the prostitutes, and that he may himself have badly treated the prostitutes he had sex with (his letters are somewhat ambiguous on this point). The frequency with which Ehrenfels brought up the example of how psychological &quot;splitting&quot; was causing men to abuse prostitutes may very well have reflected a guilty conscience on his part about past abuse that he had inflicted on the prostitutes whose services he had used. In a 1908 essay entitled &quot;The Yellow Peril&quot;, Ehrenfels wrote that 13 years earlier in 1895, he &quot;arrived, on the basis of personal experience, which it would be superfluous to recount here, at the following two alternatives: &#x27;Either I am an individual of totally corrupt sex instincts, or our monogamous sexual order is an institution with completely corrupting tendencies.&#x27;&quot;

==&quot;Flight from domesticity&quot; novels==
In the late 19th century, what the British historian John Tosh called the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels became very popular, which were a major influence on Ehrenfels. The &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels typically dealt with a ruggedly tough male who lived life on his own terms, usually alone and always in some remote frontier place, and who almost never had a relationship with a woman or children. The heroes in the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels were usually a frontiersman, a hunter, a cowboy, a scout or some other suitably adventuresome, manly occupation. Because the heroes in the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels lived in the wild in harmony with nature, they were always portrayed as being more morally pure and authentic than the people who lived in modern civilization. The hero in the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels was always the strong silent type, the taciturn tough guy who lived uncompromisingly by his own code of honor and who embodied typical male values like courage and self-reliance far better than did the men who lived in civilization. Typical of the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels were the Allan Quatermain novels by the British novelist H. Rider Haggard dealing with the adventures of a British frontiersman in 19th century South Africa; the Western novels by the German novelist Karl May dealing with the adventures of the German immigrant cowboy Old Shatterhand and his Apache best friend Winnetou in the American Old West; the Scott Allen Cameron novels by the Canadian novelist Ralph Connor about a Mountie singly-handedly upholding the law in the Rocky Mountains; and Western adventure novels by the Irish-American novelist Thomas Mayne Reid. The typical hero in Reid&#x27;s novels which were extremely popular in the United States and Europe was described as being: &quot;gallant, skillful at arms, far more at ease around men than around women, has lots of time for trappers and soldiers but little for the upper classes and intellectuals, and is much happier hunting and killing than thinking.&quot;

Tosh argued by the end of the 19th century, the burdens of being a husband and a father in a modern, industrialized, urban society were such that many men fantasized about &quot;chucking it all&quot; to escape domesticity; to live a life unburdened by the demands of a job, children, a wife or any other social obligation. Hence the popularity of the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels, which celebrated the &quot;masculine primitive&quot;. Ehrenfels&#x27;s ideas about his new society where men would live apart from women and children, would not participate in raising their children and whose relationships with their wives would be entirely sexual bear a very strong resemblance to the themes in the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels. Significantly, Ehrenfels believed that in his new society where men would not be burdened by the demands of family life would allow them to live more full and adventuresome lives like the type depicted in the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; books. Ehrenfels&#x27;s own fantasies about manly Aryan heroes battling the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; who would single-handedly kill hundreds of the &quot;evil&quot; Asians while sleeping with every white women in sight, but never having a relationship or raising children appeared to be a sexualized version of the macho fantasies found in the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels. Not all of the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; writers took the same racist line as did as Ehrenfels, with May in particular being very sympathetic towards the plight of Native-Americans in his Old Shatterhand novels. In many of the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; books, non-white peoples like the Zulus and the Apache were depicted admiringly if rather patronizingly as &quot;noble savages&quot; who in their primitive state had preserved certain spiritual qualities that people in the industrialized West had long since lost. What Ehrenfels like many other men at the time seemed to have liked in the &quot;flight from domesticity&quot; novels was the celebration of the &quot;masculine primitive&quot;; a purer, rawer, tougher form of masculinity that was alleged to exist more in the wild than that found in civilization.

==Dickinson&#x27;s critique==
Dickinson noted that for Ehrenfels, the fear of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; was always expressed in water imagery, noting how Ehrenfels warned of a &quot;flood&quot; of Chinese coming to the West, that the Chinese were a &quot;torrent of mud&quot; in which Europe was drowning in, that the Japanese were a &quot;polluting liquid&quot;, and that Europeans would not respond to this menace until the &quot;waves&quot; of Asians were up to their neck. The German historian Klaus Theweleit wrote that the same threatening water imagery was frequently used in the writings of &quot;Freikorps&quot; men during the interwar period, but the only threats were the Jews and the Communists (usually the same thing in these writings), while the Asians which threatened to subsume German men. Theweleit wrote that right-wing German men who had served in the &quot;Freikorps&quot; during the interwar period were obsessed with proving their masculinity by establishing their &quot;hardness&quot;, and that the water imagery reflected their fear of women, the erotic, love, intimacy, and of dependence, all things that threatened to make them less than manly. Theweleit argued in his 1977 book &quot;Männerphantasien&quot; (&quot;Male Fantasies&quot;) that the water imagery was associated with sexuality and a loss of self-control. Reviewing Theweleit&#x27;s book in 1987, the American historian Paul Robinson wrote that &quot;...one can&#x27;t read it without feeling that Mr. Theweleit is onto something: the piling up of examples eventually begins to take its toll on even the most skeptical.&quot; Dickinson argued that men like Ehrenfels felt the same sexual anxieties about their masculinity as did the writers examined by Theweleit, but he just projected these anxieties onto the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; rather than &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot;. To be in love can often mean a certain loss of self-control as those in love often invoke the images of being &quot;swept away&quot; or &quot;swallowed up&quot;. Dickinson argued that for Ehrenfels, a self-proclaimed macho &quot;manly man&quot; and Aryan alpha male, the prospect of being in love with someone was terrifying as it meant the possibility of losing control, and he projected those fears-which were always expressed in the water imagery-onto the Asians. Ehrenfels often denied quite vehemently that marriage had anything to do with love, writing about his own marriage that marriage was: &quot;in the final analysis the sexual provision for two persons of the opposite sex through mutual, exclusive and contractual agreement to intercourse. Our morality tries to cover the matter...instead of sexual provision we speak of a unity of souls and the contractual agreement to coitus...is more or less transparently veiled by the term &#x27;community of bed and table&#x27;&quot;. Dickson wrote that Ehrenfels&#x27;s efforts to deny that a man could ever love a woman suggested a huge fear of emotional dependence on his part.

Dickinson noted Ehrenfels&#x27;s vision of humanity was a simplistic one, in which men fought and struggled to pass on their genes by impregnating as many women as possible. The existence of homosexuality and bisexuality posed a major problem for Ehrenfels&#x27;s view of humanity. In 1897, the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, the first gay rights group in not only Germany, but also the world was founded. One of the founders of the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Magnus Hirschfeld, the German sexologist and gay rights advocate, was a well known figure in the German-speaking world in the early 20th century and his theories were much debated. In 1899, Hirschfeld had argued in an essay: &quot;that in all mental and physical characteristics there are only gradual, quantitative differences between men and women, that between them, in every respect, there are all sorts of mixed forms in extraordinary diversity&quot;. Hirschfeld&#x27;s theories about varieties of human sexuality ranging from heterosexual to bisexual to homosexual and all of which were equally valid, posed a major for Ehrenfels. Ehrenfels simply dismissed everything Hirschfeld had to say out of hand, saying that homosexuality was a case of moral degeneration caused by a few &quot;biologically degenerate homosexuals&quot; who seduced otherwise &quot;healthy boys&quot; into their lifestyle. Ehrenfels could not accept Hirschfeld&#x27;s theory that some people were born gay as it contradicted his view of male sexuality as an aggressive drive to pass on one&#x27;s genes too much.

Dickinson noted that Ehrenfels&#x27;s intense bouts of depression together with periods of manic activity suggested a degree of emotional instability on his part, adding: &quot;A number of prominent men of the period more or less conform to the same pattern. Gail Bederman has described related personality structures in G. Stanley Hall and Theodore Roosevelt. Both exhibited manic restlessness, quasi-messianic self-regard, insecure masculine sexuality, a fear of racial degeneration and bizarre theories regarding the regenerating evolutionary power of masculine sexuality and the genocidal instincts of all males-who, each believed, naturally sought to exterminate men of other races as part of the struggle for the survival of the fittest. Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, while probably closer to outright mental illness, exhibited similar traits-including manic activity, intellectual eclecticism, megalomania, occasional nervous breakdowns, genocidal cogitations, and concern with the &#x27;Yellow Peril&#x27;.&quot; Ehrenfels projected feminine qualities onto the Chinese, always using feminine verbs when writing about the Chinese, and always compared China to a woman after 1904. The German language has three sorts of verbs: masculine, feminine and neutral. Ehrenfels&#x27;s fear of the Chinese reflected his fear of the feminine which might overwhelm the masculine through the powers of love and sex. By contrast, Ehrenfels always used masculine verbs when writing about the Japanese, and he often compared the Japanese to a rival male that was seeking to dominate the &quot;woman China&quot; in competition to the European powers that were also compared to males. Dickison argued that Ehrenfels&#x27;s constant use of this sort of sexualized language of power, aggression and domination when writing about China reflected his own fear of sex, love, sexual dependence, his sexual adequacy as a man, and most of all, emotional dependence. Dickinson further noted the great irony of Ehrenfels&#x27;s life, namely that his own biography disapproved his theories about men as sex-crazed animals incapable of love for either the women in their lives or their children. By all accounts, Ehrenfels did indeed deeply love his wife and his two children.

Dickinson noted that many of Ehrenfels&#x27;s ideas seem to anticipate National Socialism, but this was not the case. Within the first decade of the 20th century some of the more radical members of the eugenicist-Social Darwinist movement in Germany were already advocating killing the physically and/or mentally disabled as the best way of improving the Aryan race. Ehrenfels was deeply horrified by these ideas, and made it clear that in his proposed new society, the mentally and physically disabled would be prevented from marrying, and this was enough. Had Ehrenfels lived long enough, he would have been appalled by the Action T4 program launched by the German government in January 1939 to exterminate all physically and mentally disabled people in the &quot;Reich&quot; (which by that time included Austria). Likewise, Ehrenfels was opposed to antisemitism, writing there was no &quot;Jewish bogey&quot; threatening the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, called antisemitism &quot;silly&quot; and argued that the Jews would be very useful allies for the Aryans in the coming war with the Asians. In this, Ehrenfels parted company with his friend Houston Stewart Chamberlain who believed in the coming great &quot;race war&quot; that the Asians together with the blacks would fight under the leadership of the Jews against the Aryans.

==Baroness Emma von Ehrenfels==
Ehrenfels&#x27;s wife Emma was befriended by Houston Stewart Chamberlain. His daughter was the author Imma von Bodmershof and his son Rolf, a professor of anthropology who converted to Islam in 1927 and assumed the name Omar. Omar Rolf&#x27;s wife, Elfriede von Bodmershof, was a literary person. As well, she registered the pseudonym &quot;Kurban Said&quot; as belonging to her for the novels &quot;Ali and Nino&quot; as well as &quot;Girl from the Golden Horn.&quot; However, Lucy Tal whose company E.P. Tal had published &quot;Ali and Nino&quot; wrote her lawyer saying, &quot;I had never heard of the Baroness... Also my late husband&#x27;s right hand and secretary knew nothing of the Baroness. Only much later, when for some reason, we looked at Buchhaendler Boersenblatt, we discovered the Baroness as Kurban Said. Of course, under the Nazis pseudonyms were born, people unrightful had themselves as authors ...&quot;

In the 1890s, Ehrenfels-who was a passionate fan of Richard Wagner-befriended a fellow Wagnerite, the British born German &quot;völkisch&quot; thinker Houston Stewart Chamberlain, &quot;the Evangelist of Race&quot;. Ehrenfels, who despite being a Wagnerite and a friend of Chamberlain&#x27;s did not generally associate himself with the more extreme racist and anti-Semitic wing of the Wagner movement that Chamberlain came to be the leader of. Ehrenfels never accepted Chamberlain&#x27;s anti-Semitism, but he was influenced by Chamberlain&#x27;s theory that the Aryan race was the greatest and best race of them all. Chamberlain was later to have an affair with Ehrenfels&#x27;s wife, Baroness Emma von Ehrenfels.

==Felix Weltsch==
The Czech Zionist, philosopher and friend of Kafka Felix Weltsch wrote many essays and memos about Ehrenfels, who himself was of partly Jewish descent. Weltsch was one of Ehrenfels&#x27;s most important pupils.

<text>Oliver Robert Ocasek (November 2, 1925 – June 25, 1999) was an American politician of the Democratic Party who served as President of the Ohio State Senate in the 1970s and 1980s. After the Democrats lost their majority in the Senate, Ocasek was replaced as party leader by Harry Meshel. In 1962 and 1968, Ocasek ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. He lost both times to Republican incumbent William H. Ayres. In 1986 he lost a Democratic primary for congress in the 14th district to Thomas C. Sawyer. Ocasek also served on the Ohio Board of Education from 1993 to 1998.

<text>Barzaz Breiz (in modern spelling Barzhaz Breizh, meaning &quot;Ballads of Brittany&quot;: &quot;barzh&quot; is the equivalent of &quot;bard&quot; and &quot;Breizh&quot; means &quot;Brittany&quot;) is a collection of Breton popular songs collected by Théodore Hersart de la Villemarqué and published in 1839. It was compiled from oral tradition and preserves traditional folk tales, legends and music. Hersart de la Villemarqué grew up in the manor of Plessix in Nizon, near Pont-Aven, and was half Breton himself.

==Significance==
The collection was published in the original Breton language with a French translation. It achieved a wide distribution, as the Romantic generation in France that &quot;discovered&quot; the Basque language was beginning to be curious about all the submerged cultures of Europe and the pagan survivals just under the surface of folk Catholicism. The &quot;Barzaz Breiz&quot; brought Breton folk culture for the first time into European awareness. One of the oldest of the collected songs was the legend of Ys. The book was also notable for the fact that La Villemarqué recorded the music of the ballads as well as the words. This was one of the first attempts to collect and print Breton traditional music, except hymns.

Until this publication the so-called Matter of Britain was known only from references to some legends in French language Romances of the 12th to 14th centuries, in which much of the culture was also transformed to suit Gallic hearers.

The book is divided into two parts. The first part collects ballads about historical legends and heroic deeds of Breton leaders, including Nominoe, Erispoe and the warriors of the Combat of the Thirty. The second part records local culture, concentrating on religious festivals and seasonal events.

==Authenticity==
The publication of traditional folk literature was controversial at this time because of the dispute about the most famous of such collections, James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;The Poems of Ossian&quot;, which purported to be translated from ancient Celtic poetry, but was widely believed to have been largely written by MacPherson himself. After the publication of &quot;Barzaz Breiz&quot;, François-Marie Luzel criticised the work at a scholarly conference in 1868. At the 1872 Congress of the Breton Association at Saint-Brieuc, he argued that the songs had been completely manufactured in the manner of Macpherson, because, he said, he had never himself met with ballads in such elegant Breton and free of borrowed French words. The main problem raised by his opponents was that Villemarqué refused to show his notebooks to other scholars.

The dispute continued into the twentieth century. In 1907 La Villemarque&#x27;s son, Pierre de la Villemarqué, published a defence of his father&#x27;s work. However, in 1960 Francis Gourvil argued in a PhD thesis that the &quot;Barzaz Breiz&quot; was a forgery. In 1974 Donatien Laurent partially rejected these accusations by demonstrating the authenticity of the material of the book thanks to the discovery in 1964 of Villemarqué&#x27;s notebooks. Laurent&#x27;s research was published in 1989. Laurent concluded that Villemarqué had rearranged the material he had collected in order to enliven and clean up the texts and music, but that this was common practice at the time, comparable to work of the Brothers Grimm. An assessment of the dispute is given in the chapter &quot;Collectors and Singers&quot; of Mary-Ann Constantine&#x27;s 1996 study &quot;Breton Ballads&quot;.

==Editions==
The first edition was published in 1839 in Paris by Éditions Delloye, in the form of books in 2 °-8. Reprinted in 1840, 1845 and, at Didier et Cie, 1846, the book was then published in 1867 in Paris.

In 1865 the standard English translation by Tom Taylor was published under the title &quot;Ballads and Songs of Brittany&quot;. The edition contained some of the original melodies &quot;harmonized by Mrs. Tom Taylor&quot;, but omitted some of the ballads.

The 1867 edition was subsequently reprinted many times to the present day by the academic library Perrin, not counting the many English translations (Taylor, Fleay ... ), German (Keller-Seckendorf. ... ), Italian (Pascoli), Polish, and so on.

In 1981 a new edition appeared in pocket-sized format.

In 1989 Mouladurioù Hor Yezh issued a &quot;Barzhaz Breizh&quot; with only the Breton text, but changed into modern orthography and including the musical score.

In 1996, Coop Breizh published a pocket version of the book in French without the Breton text.

In 1999, Editions du Layeur issued a reprint of the 1867 edition, by Yann-Fañch Kemener, singer and collector, plus the foreword to the 1845 edition. The main merit is that he put Breton and French versions of each poem together ensuring a very high readability. A compact disc accompanies the book provides a performance of twelve of the songs by Yann Fanch Kemener and &quot;Maîtrise de Bretagne&quot;, solo and duo.

<text>BloodRayne is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Terminal Reality and released on October 31, 2002. The game has since spawned a franchise with the addition of sequels, films, and self-contained comic books.

A remastered version was released on November 20, 2020 as BloodRayne: Terminal Cut by Terminal Reality and Ziggurat Interactive, and later on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series and Nintendo Switch as BloodRayne: ReVamped on November 18, 2021.

==Plot==
In 1933, while searching for her vampire father, dhampir Rayne is recruited by the Brimstone Society, a secret society that monitors and combats supernatural threats to humanity. For her first mission, Rayne is deployed to the town of Mortton, Louisiana, to investigate reports of a plague that is transforming local residents into zombie-like mutants. She is accompanied by Mynce, her mentor and fellow dhampir.

In Mortton, Rayne finds the town infested by spider-like monsters called Maraisreq, one of which devours and apparently kills Mynce. After killing the &quot;queen&quot; Maraisreq, Rayne finds a strange glowing rib in its corpse; when she touches it, the rib immediately implants itself into her own torso. Before she can recover from the shock, Rayne is attacked by a man in a Nazi uniform who forcibly removes the rib from her body and leaves her for dead, although she survives.

Five years later, in 1938, Brimstone sends Rayne to Argentina to perform reconnaissance at a mining facility where the Nazis are rumored to be searching for a mystical relic of great power. Brimstone provides Rayne with a target list of high-ranking Nazi officers to assassinate, one of whom she recognizes as the man who attacked her in Louisiana: Jürgen Wulf, leader of the Gegengeist Gruppe (G.G.G.; literally &quot;Anti-Ghost Group&quot;), the Nazi counterparts of Brimstone who seek to harness occult powers for the Third Reich. A Thule Society high priest tells Rayne that the Nazis are searching the mine for the skull of Beliar, a legendary king of Atlantis, whom the Nazis revere as the pinnacle of Aryan superiority.

As Rayne descends into the mine, she discovers that the facility has been overrun by &quot;Daemites,&quot; demonic parasites that take humans as hosts and serve to guard Beliar&#x27;s skull. Deep within the mine, Rayne locates the crystal skull containing Beliar&#x27;s eye, the true relic, which implants itself into her head, enhancing her vision. One of Rayne&#x27;s targets, the cyborg Mauler, informs her that Beliar was not an Atlantean king at all, but was in fact the original devil. Beliar was overthrown by Mephisto, who dismembered him and scattered his body parts across the world. The rib from the queen Maraisreq is one of these parts, as is the eye from the mine, but the most powerful relic is Beliar&#x27;s heart, which can summon the demon himself. Mauler boasts that the heart is buried beneath Castle Gaustadt in Germany, where Wulf will soon excavate it. The Nazis collapse the mine in order to destroy the Daemites, and Rayne departs for Germany to confront Wulf and prevent the G.G.G. from summoning Beliar.

Unbeknownst to the Nazis, Castle Gaustadt is home to a clan of ancient vampires that, after centuries in isolation, have evolved into bestial monsters. One of these vampires, Hedrox, manages to obtain Beliar&#x27;s heart, but does not know how to access its powers. While the feral vampires and Nazi soldiers attack each other, Rayne fights her way into the castle, where she encounters Mynce. Mynce reveals that she faked her death in order to infiltrate the G.G.G. and has been working as a double agent for Brimstone ever since. She warns Rayne that Wulf has already absorbed several of Beliar&#x27;s relics into his own body, making him extremely dangerous. Shortly afterward, Wulf ambushes and kills Mynce, ripping her heart out in front of Rayne. A furious Rayne swears revenge on Wulf and pursues him into the castle&#x27;s cathedral.

In the cathedral, Rayne confronts Wulf and Hedrox. Hedrox consumes Beliar&#x27;s heart, inadvertently summoning the demon into his own body. The revived Beliar demands that Rayne and Wulf return his stolen body parts, leading to a three-way fight between them. After a pitched battle, Rayne decapitates Wulf and banishes Beliar, leaving only his still-beating heart behind. Rayne briefly appears tempted by the power of Beliar&#x27;s heart, but ultimately disposes of it by kicking it down a storm drain.

Brimstone are pleased by Rayne&#x27;s success and note that she deserves a rest, but they caution against the growing threat posed by another, even greater evil: Rayne&#x27;s father, whom Brimstone has finally located.

==Development==
The game had a development budget of $2 million. The total budget was $6 million to $7 million. Development time was more than two years.

==Reception==
The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of &quot;BloodRayne&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, while the GameCube and PC versions received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the PS2 version 7, 7.5 and 7.5 for a total of 7.33 out of 10. In Japan, where the same console version was ported and published by Electronic Arts on August 26, 2004, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 29 out of 40.

<doc id="875533" wikidata="Q423018" url="?curid=875533" title="Wollastonite">
<text>Wollastonite is a calcium inosilicate mineral (CaSiO3) that may contain small amounts of iron, magnesium, and manganese substituting for calcium. It is usually white. It forms when impure limestone or dolomite is subjected to high temperature and pressure, which sometimes occurs in the presence of silica-bearing fluids as in skarns or in contact with metamorphic rocks. Associated minerals include garnets, vesuvianite, diopside, tremolite, epidote, plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene and calcite. It is named after the English chemist and mineralogist William Hyde Wollaston (1766–1828).

Despite its chemical similarity to the compositional spectrum of the pyroxene group of minerals—where magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) substitution for calcium ends with diopside and hedenbergite respectively—it is structurally very different, with a third tetrahedron in the linked chain (as opposed to two in the pyroxenes).

==Production trends==

Estimated world production of crude wollastonite ore was 1,200,000 tonnes in 2021. World reserves of wollastonite are estimated to exceed 100 million tonnes, though some existing deposits have not been surveyed.

Major producers of wollastonite include China, India, the United States, Mexico, and Finland.

In the United States, wollastonite is mined in Willsboro, New York (the first laboratory for local wollastonite research was in Essex, New York by Koert Burnham in the 1940s. The original laboratory building still exists as a residential &amp; commercial building) and Gouverneur, New York. Deposits have also been mined commercially in North Western Mexico.

The price of raw wollastonite in 2008 varied between US$80 and US$500 per tonne depending on the country and size and shape of the powder particles.

==Uses==
Wollastonite is among the fastest reacting silicates, but may have high costs associated with carbon storage. Addition of wollastonite to soil stimulates organic carbon mineralization.

=== Ceramics ===
Wollastonite has industrial importance in ceramics manufacturing as an additive.

In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing, increases green and fired strength, maintains brightness during firing, permits fast firing, and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects.

=== Construction ===
Wollastonite can serve as a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products. Similar to asbestos, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength in composites. In some industries, wollastonite is used in different percentages of impurities, such as its use as a fabricator of mineral wool insulation, or as an ornamental building material.
Wollastonite is used in a cement announced in 2019 which &quot;reduces the overall carbon footprint in precast concrete by 70%.&quot;

Wollastonite has been studied for carbon mineralization for storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) according to the following reaction:

=== Metallurgy ===
In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and to protect the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel.

=== Paint ===
As an additive in paint, wollastonite improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves its resistance to weathering, reduces gloss, reduces pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and suspending agent.

=== Plastic ===
In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between the wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added.

Plastics and rubber applications were estimated to account for 25% to 35% of U.S. sales in 2009, followed by ceramics with 20% to 25%; paint, 10% to 15%; metallurgical applications, 10% to 15%; friction products, 10% to 15%; and miscellaneous, 10% to 15%. Ceramic applications probably account for 30% to 40% of wollastonite sales worldwide, followed by polymers (plastics and rubber) with 30% to 35% of sales, and paint with 10% to 15% of sales. The remaining sales were for construction, friction products, and metallurgical applications.

==Substitutes==

The acicular nature of many wollastonite products allows it to compete with other acicular materials, such as ceramic fiber, glass fiber, steel fiber, and several organic fibers, such as aramid, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene in products where improvements in dimensional stability, flexural modulus, and heat deflection are sought.

Wollastonite also competes with several nonfibrous minerals or rocks, such as kaolin, mica, and talc, which are added to plastics to increase flexural strength, and such minerals as barite, calcium carbonate, gypsum, and talc, which impart dimensional stability to plastics.

In ceramics, wollastonite competes with carbonates, feldspar, lime, and silica as a source of calcium and silicon. Its use in ceramics depends on the formulation of the ceramic body and the firing method.

==Composition==
In a pure CaSiO3, each component forms nearly half of the mineral by weight: 48.3% of CaO and 51.7% of SiO2. In some cases, small amounts of iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn), and lesser amounts of magnesium (Mg) substitute for calcium (Ca) in the mineral formula (&quot;e.g.&quot;, rhodonite). Wollastonite can form a series of solid solutions in the system CaSiO3-FeSiO3, or hydrothermal synthesis of phases in the system MnSiO3-CaSiO3.

==Geologic occurrence==

Wollastonite usually occurs as a common constituent of a thermally metamorphosed impure limestone, it also could occur when the silicon is due to metamorphism in contact altered calcareous sediments, or to contamination in the invading igneous rock. In most of these occurrences it is the result of the following reaction between calcite and silica with the loss of carbon dioxide:

:CaCO3 + SiO2 → CaSiO3 + CO2

Wollastonite may also be produced in a diffusion reaction in skarn, it develops when limestone within a sandstone is metamorphosed by a dike, which results in the formation of wollastonite in the sandstone as a result of outward migration of Ca.

==Structure==
Wollastonite crystallizes triclinically in space group P with the lattice constants &quot;a&quot; = 7.94 Å, &quot;b&quot; = 7.32 Å, c = 7.07 Å; &quot;α&quot; = 90,03°, &quot;β&quot; = 95,37°, &quot;γ&quot; = 103,43° and six formula units per unit cell. Wollastonite was once classed structurally among the pyroxene group, because both of these groups have a ratio of Si:O = 1:3. In 1931, Warren and Biscoe showed that the crystal structure of wollastonite differs from minerals of the pyroxene group, and they classified this mineral within a group known as the pyroxenoids. It has been shown that the pyroxenoid chains are more kinked than those of pyroxene group, and exhibit longer repeat distance. The structure of wollastonite contains infinite chains of [SiO4] tetrahedra sharing common vertices, running parallel to the &quot;b&quot;-axis. The chain motif in wollastonite repeats after three tetrahedra, whereas in pyroxenes only two are needed. The repeat distance in the wollastonite chains is 7.32 Å and equals the length of the crystallographic &quot;b&quot;-axis.

Molten CaSiO3 maintains a tetrahedral SiO4 local structure at temperatures up to 2000 °C. The nearest neighbor Ca-O coordination decreases from 6.0(2) in the room temperature glass to 5.0(2) in the 1700 °C liquid, coincident with an increasing number of longer Ca-O neighbors.
