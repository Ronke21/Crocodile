<doc id="877559" wikidata="Q1503304" url="?curid=877559" title="Los Planetas">
<text>Los Planetas (&quot;The Planets&quot;) is a Spanish indie rock group from the city of Granada which started out in the mid 1990s and continue now through the 2020s. The group&#x27;s first hit was &quot;Qué puedo hacer&quot; (&quot;What can I do?&quot;) from their album &quot;Super 8&quot;, although they had previously had some success with various demos on a contest run by Spanish national public radio station Radio 3.

After &quot;Super 8&quot; (1994 RCA-BMG Music Spain) the group produced albums which caught on quickly in the Spanish indie scene, including &quot;Pop&quot; (1996 RCA-BMG Music Spain), &quot;Una semana en el motor de un autobús&quot; (&quot;A week in the engine of a bus&quot;, 1998 RCA-BMG Music Spain), &quot;Unidad de Desplazamiento&quot; (&quot;Movement unit&quot;, 2000 RCA-BMG Music Spain), &quot;Encuentro con entidades&quot; (&quot;Encounter with entities&quot;, 2002 RCA-BMG Music Spain) and &quot;Los Planetas contra la ley la gravedad&quot; (&quot;Los Planetas against the laws of gravity&quot;, 2004 RCA-BMG Music Spain).

They have released two compilation albums: one including all of their singles and EPs in 1999, &quot;Canciones para una orquesta química&quot; (&quot;Songs for a chemical orchestra&quot;, 1999 RCA-BMG Music Spain), and a greatest hits album in 2009, &quot;Principios básicos de astronomía&quot; (&quot;Basic principles of astronomy&quot;, 2009 Octubre - Sony Music Entertainment).

Los Planetas are strongly influenced by English-language rock bands such as Joy Division and early-period Mercury Rev and are considered to be a key reference point in the world of Spanish indie.

A notable influence from flamenco music is being shown in their 2007 work (&quot;La leyenda del espacio&quot; (2007 RCA-Sony BMG), influence still shown in their latest albums &quot;Una ópera egipcia&quot; (2010, Octubre - Sony Music Entertainment) and &quot;&quot;Zona temporalmente autónoma&quot; (2017, El Ejército Rojo - El Volcán Música).

<text>Jacob Sechler Coxey Sr. (April 16, 1854 – May 18, 1951), sometimes known as General Coxey, was an American politician who ran for office several times in Ohio. Twice, in 1894 and 1914, he led &quot;Coxey&#x27;s Army&quot;, a group of unemployed men who marched to Washington, D.C., to present a &quot;Petition in Boots&quot; demanding that the United States Congress allocate funds to create jobs for the unemployed. Although the marches failed, Coxey&#x27;s Army was an early attempt to arouse political interest in an issue that grew in importance until the Social Security Act of 1935 encouraged the establishment of state unemployment insurance programs.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Jacob Sechler Coxey was born on April 16, 1854, in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, the son of the former Mary Ann Sechler and Thomas Coxey. His father worked in a sawmill at the time Jacob was born, but the family pulled up stakes to move to industrially thriving Danville, Pennsylvania, in 1860, with Jacob&#x27;s father taking a job working in an iron mill.

Known as Jake, Coxey excelled in school, attending local public schools and at least one additional year in a private academy before leaving to take his first job at the age of 16 as a water boy in the mill where his father worked.

Coxey spent eight years at the iron mill, advancing through the ranks from water boy to machine oiler, boiler tender, and finally to stationary engineer. Coxey left the mill in 1878 to establish a business partnership with an uncle in a Harrisburg scrap-iron business. In this capacity, Coxey went on a scrap iron buying trip to the town of Massillon, located 325 miles to the west, in 1881. Coxey liked the town so much that he decided to stay, cashing out of the scrap iron business and using the proceeds to purchase a large farm and establish a quarry producing silica sand for the manufacture of glass and iron.

Coxey was a passionate equestrian, who bred blooded horses and raced or sold them across the nation. Horse racing was among the most popular spectator sports in the United States and Coxey&#x27;s horse-breeding enterprise was prosperous, but he fell into gambling on racing, which contributed to the end of his first marriage in 1888, after 14 years and four children.

Coxey would remarry in 1891, siring two more children, including a son named &quot;Legal Tender&quot; in honor of his father&#x27;s quirky monetary obsessions.

===First political interests===

Coxey was born to parents who supported the Democratic Party and he entered politics under this banner. With the coming of the economic crisis of 1877, Coxey became a partisan of the United States Greenback Party, which ascribed the nations economic woes to faulty economic principles which led to a severe contraction of the money supply in the years after the American Civil War. Prosperity could be restored, Greenbackers believed, by the issuance of sufficient quantities of paper money.

When the People&#x27;s Party emerged at the start of the 1890s, it earned the support of Coxey and most other Greenbackers and he shifted his allegiance to that political organization.

Coxey had experience as a laborer and an employer; he was also aware of the agricultural situation. He was a reformer who was willing to spend time and money to promote his plans for the betterment of the social order. Coxey was regarded by many contemporary observers as convincingly earnest. One reporter wrote, &quot;He seems to be profoundly impressed with the suffering of mankind and with a belief that there is a deep-laid plan of monopolist to crush the poor to the earth.&quot;

He was often branded as a crank for challenging the economic system that made him so prosperous.

===Coxey&#x27;s Army===

In 1893, a severe economic depression swept the United States – a crisis remembered as the Panic of 1893. Unemployment skyrocketed, bank runs paralyzed the local financial system, and credit dried up, while a protracted period of deflation put negative pressure on wages, prompting widespread lockouts and strikes.

Never one to be short of either self-confidence or political ambition, Coxey believed that he had a cure for the nation&#x27;s economic woes and began espousing a plan of public works, specifically road improvement, to be financed through the issuance of $500 million in paper money, backed by government bonds. This expenditure would in one swoop improve infrastructure, put unemployed workers to work, and loosen the strangled credit situation, Coxey believed.

To accompany his novel and controversial economic program, organized around the slogan &quot;Good Roads&quot;, Coxey and his close political associate Carl Browne devised a novel political strategy designed to force the United States government into action. Rather than attempt to form a conventional political organization to capture decision-making offices, Coxey decided upon a course of what would later be known as direct action — the assembly of a mass of unemployed workers who would boldly march on Washington, D.C., to demand immediate satisfaction of their needs by Congress. This plan began to take shape early in the spring of 1894, to the point that by March the managing editor of the &quot;Chicago Record&quot; would assign young reporter Ray Stannard Baker to cover the &quot;queer chap down there in Massillon&quot; who was &quot;getting up an army of the unemployed to march on Washington.&quot;

Many members of Coxey&#x27;s family were opposed to his involvement in Coxey&#x27;s Army. His father refused to talk to reporters and called his son &quot;stiff necked&quot;, &quot;cranky&quot;, and &quot;pig-headed&quot;. One of Coxey&#x27;s sisters called him an embarrassment.

He was a member of the Socialist Party circa 1912.

===Death and legacy===

Coxey died on May 18, 1951, aged 97, in Massillon, Ohio. When asked his secret to longevity, he told reporters an array of reasons from elixirs to not resisting temptation.

<text>Michel Serrault (24 January 1928 – 29 July 2007) was a French stage and film actor who appeared from 1954 until 2007 in more than 130 films.

==Life and career==
His first professional job was in a touring production in Germany of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les Fourberies de Scapin&quot;.

In 1948, he began his career in the theatre with Robert Dhéry in &quot;Les Branquignols&quot;. His first film was &quot;Ah! Les belles bacchantes&quot;, starring Robert Dhéry, Colette Brosset (Dhéry&#x27;s then-wife), and Louis de Funès; directed by Jean Loubignac in 1954. Serrault played in the 1955 suspense thriller &quot;Les diaboliques&quot;, starring Simone Signoret and directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot.

From February 1973 through 1978, he portrayed the role of Albin/Zaza opposite Jean Poiret in the play &quot;La cage aux folles&quot;, written by Poiret. He recreated the role for the film version of the play, which was released in 1978. In 1977-1978 he played the composer Jacques Offenbach in a six-part series of one-hour episodes about the musician&#x27;s life, each one focusing on a specific aspect or work.

Serrault died from relapsing polychondritis at his home in Équemauville on 29 July 2007 at age 79. He was buried in Sainte-Catherine&#x27;s cemetery in Honfleur and was transferred in 2009 to the cemetery of Neuilly-sur-Seine near his wife Juanita Saint-Peyron and daughter Caroline, who died in 1977. He had another daughter, actress Nathalie Serrault.

<text>KDVS (90.3 FM) is a student-run college and community radio station based in Davis, California. Featuring a freeform programming format, the station is owned by Regents of the University of California. Broadcasting at 13,000 watts, it is one of the most powerful freeform university-based radio stations in the United States.

==History==
The idea for starting KDVS was conceived by students in the former Beckett-Hughes dormitories in late 1963. Using the call letters KCD and 880 AM as the frequency, the students &quot;broadcast&quot; their first program on February 1, 1964, from a laundry room in Beckett Hall. The station&#x27;s signal, which was transmitted by telephone lines, could only reach certain dorms.

Two years later, in 1966, KCD and the university&#x27;s student government, Associated Students of UC Davis, joined in applying for a Class D noncommercial broadcast license. The FCC awarded the license to the university on October 18, 1967. By then, the station had moved to the newly constructed Memorial Union, where its inaugural broadcast was aired on January 2, 1968, under the call letters KDVS.

Initially, KDVS had 10 watts and broadcast on 91.5 FM in mono. In 1971, the station&#x27;s signal was upgraded to stereo, but a far more significant development occurred six years later. In 1977, during a period when the FCC was forcing Class D stations to either upgrade or go silent, KDVS received a power increase to 5,000 watts and moved to its current frequency 90.3 FM. Two additional power increases were approved by the FCC over the years: 9,200 watts in 1983 and 13,000 watts in 2013. The latter increase enabled the station to cover most of Sacramento, as well as portions of Placer, El Dorado, and Solano counties.

==Additional developments==

A free newsletter entitled &quot;KDViationS&quot;, written and composed by the volunteer staff of the radio station, is published quarterly. The station also produces &quot;This Week in Science&quot;, which is broadcast live but is known primarily in podcast form. KDVS is also the home of the public affairs programs &quot;Radio Parallax&quot; and &quot;Dr. Andy&#x27;s Poetry and Technology Hour&quot;.

In summer 2006, KDVS started the non-profit record label KDVS Recordings to promote independent artists in the Davis and Sacramento areas.

==Notable station alumni==
Several now-famous artists were members of the KDVS staff in their early years. Former KDVS DJs include DJ Shadow, Lyrics Born, Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel of Blackalicious, Steve Wynn of The Dream Syndicate, and Kendra Smith of both The Dream Syndicate and Opal.

<text>The Martin XB-16, company designation Model 145, was a projected heavy bomber designed in the United States during the 1930s.

==Design and development==
The XB-16 was designed to meet the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) request for a bomber that could carry of bombs .

The XB-16 (Model 145A) was to use four Allison V-1710 liquid-cooled reciprocating V-engines; contemporary American aircraft used air-cooled radial engines.

In 1935, Martin revised the XB-16 design as the Model 145B. The wingspan was increased from to , and a set of V-1710 engines added to the trailing edge. This version had a wingspan 20% greater than that of the B-29 Superfortress, the first operational bomber that would fill the role intended for the XB-16.

The XB-16 was canceled for essentially the same reason that the Boeing XB-15 project was, as it was not fast enough to meet the requirements set by the Army. Since both were canceled around the same time, Martin did not have time to produce an XB-16.

<text>Trinity Western University (TWU) is a private Christian liberal arts university with campuses in both Langley and Richmond, British Columbia. The school is a member of Universities Canada.

TWU was established in 1962 and enrols approximately 5,000 students with a suburban-rural campus in Langley. Trinity Western is Canada&#x27;s largest privately funded Christian university with a broad-based liberal arts, sciences, and professional studies curriculum, offering 45 undergraduate majors and 17 graduate and post-graduate programs. In the classroom, TWU has 16:1 student-faculty ratio, average first-year class size of 37, and overall average class size of 15.

Trinity Western is a member of the Royal Society of Canada. Its varsity teams, known as the Spartans, are members of U Sports. According to Universities Canada, the non-profit national organization that represents Canadian universities and colleges, TWU&#x27;s domestic tuition is the most expensive of any university in Canada.

==History==
Trinity Western University traces its history back to 1957, when a committee was established by the Evangelical Free Church of America to study and consider the feasibility of a liberal arts college on North America&#x27;s Pacific Coast. The committee decided on a location between Vancouver and Seattle in rural British Columbia, in what is now the Township of Langley.
Trinity Junior College began as a two-year college in 1962, and its name was changed to Trinity Western College 10 years later, following a significant period of growth in enrolment and program options. After 20 years as a transfer college, Trinity Western began awarding baccalaureate degrees in 1980. 
In 1985 the British Columbia Provincial Government legislated the institution to its current position as a privately funded Christian university and it became known as Trinity Western University. It is the fourth-oldest university in the province of British Columbia after the University of British Columbia, the University of Victoria, and Emily Carr University of Art and Design.

===Insignia and symbols===

Trinity Western&#x27;s motto is &quot;Turris Fortis Deus Noster.&quot; The Latin motto is translated as &quot;A Mighty Fortress is Our God&quot;. The inspiration for the motto came from a famous hymn of the same name written by Martin Luther.

The university&#x27;s coat of arms was granted by the Royal College of Arms, and was presented to then-university president R. Neil Snider in 1986 by the Lieutenant Governor of B.C. on behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

A torch symbol is also used prevalently at the university, as the coat of arms is reserved to authenticate the highest official University academic and legal documents.

Spartans is the nickname of the varsity teams that compete for Trinity Western University. The name, which comes from the Ancient Greek civilization of Sparta, originated when the university&#x27;s first intercollegiate team the men&#x27;s basketball team, began competing in 1964.

==Academic programs==
Trinity Western University is an independent, privately supported institution, offering a liberal arts education. Since its founding in 1962, it has identified as a Christian institution, although it has always been governed independently from any church or religious organization. It is currently administered by a 14-member Board of Governors, to which the President reports. Sociologist Dr. Todd Martin is the interim president effective July 1, 2024.

Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Students usually take classes through the university&#x27;s semester system, with three semesters taking place each year. The fall semester lasts from September to December, and the spring semester from January to April. For students wishing to take classes over summer, the university offers several courses on campus as well as travel studies through its summer semester programming, which runs from May to August.

Graduate students take courses through the Faculty of Graduate Studies and ACTS Seminaries. Master&#x27;s degree programs are available in the humanities, education, linguistics, psychology, business, nursing, and theology.

The university hosts a number of research institutes and centres, including the Dead Sea Scrolls Institute, Gender Studies Institute, Religion, Culture and Conflict Research Group, Septuagint Institute, Centre for Entrepreneurial Leadership, Centre for Spiritual Formation in Higher Education, Religion in Canada Institute, as well as, the Institute of Indigenous Issues and Perspectives.

Trinity Western&#x27;s students are from all 10 provinces, 37 U.S. states, and 33 foreign countries. The student body is 72% Canadian, 12% American, and 13% are from overseas. The university employs a faculty of approximately 250 instructors and professors, enabling a student to faculty ratio of 11:1, and an average class size of 25. Over 85% of Trinity Western&#x27;s professors have doctorates.

Trinity Western University is accredited by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, and is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Trinity Western University is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. Tuition for the 2014–15 academic year was $22,260 CDN, making tuition the most expensive of any Canadian university. Roughly 95% of Trinity Western&#x27;s incoming and transfer students receive some financial aid in the form of scholarships or grants not including loans. International students pay the same fees as Canadian students.

Trinity Western University is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, the senior national organization for the promotion of learning and research in Canada.

===Undergraduate===
Undergraduate degrees awarded by Trinity Western University include the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Education, and Bachelor of Human Kinetics. There is also a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering transfer program in collaboration with the University of British Columbia&#x27;s engineering department. Honours programs are available in a number of majors.

Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held one- or two-times a week with an additional conversation-based seminar called a &quot;discussion group&quot;. To graduate, all students must complete a liberal arts core curriculum known as the &quot;University Core&quot;, comprising 18 classes of various subjects. Students have a high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured Core, which allows students to study subjects of interest outside their chosen major. Most of the Core classes at Trinity Western are led by a full-time professor (as opposed to a teaching assistant).

Within the 18 classes, students complete a two-semester English language requirement, along with courses from the fine arts, natural sciences, philosophy, history, sociology, and religious studies departments, two courses of interdisciplinary studies, and up to three physical education courses.

In addition to the Core, students are required to complete an academic major. Trinity Western University grants bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 45 academic majors, and 56 minors, concentrations, or certificates, with over 1,200 courses from which to choose. Students may choose courses from any of the university&#x27;s faculties or schools:
* Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences
* Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences
* School of the Arts, Media + Culture
* School of Business
* School of Human Kinetics
* School of Education
* School of Nursing
* Catholic Pacific College, Trinity Western&#x27;s constituent Catholic college

Whereas most courses are offered on Trinity Western&#x27;s main campus in Langley, students may study in Bellingham, Washington; Richmond, British Columbia; or online. Furthermore, many take part in travel studies and exchange programs at partner institutions or universities across the globe. Students are also free to design their own courses with the support of a faculty member or member of the administration.

=== Cancelled Faculty of Law ===

In July 2012, the university submitted a proposal to offer a Juris Doctor program. The proposal was put forth to the provincial Ministry of Advanced Education and the Federation of Law Societies of Canada, and was approved in December 2013.

On December 12, 2014, due to the ongoing lawsuits surrounding law societies voting to not automatically accredit TWU law students upon graduation, B.C. Advanced Education Minister Amrik Virk revoked the province&#x27;s approval of the proposed law school at Trinity Western University. In his letter to the school&#x27;s administration, he expressed the importance of the legal process and encouraged TWU to re-apply once the court cases have been settled.

== Student Life ==
In 2011, Trinity Western received an A level rating in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s &quot;Overall Student Satisfaction&quot; category and an A+ rating for its &quot;Sense of Community on Campus&quot;. Campus housing is provided to students in all years of study, and all students in their first and second year are required to live on campus in residential halls unless living with family. Third and fourth year students have the option of living off-campus. Trinity Western offers its students nearly 100 organizations, teams, and sports.

The university was founded by a committee commissioned by the Evangelical Free Church of America, a denomination in the Radical Pietistic tradition, to establish a Christian liberal arts college. Accordingly, the committee&#x27;s mission has shaped the campus and the university. Trinity Western University has maintained extremely close ties with the broader Christian church, and historically has had close relationships with the Evangelical and Mainline Protestant denominations, as well as with the Mennonite tradition recently. This has also resulted in the university having a significant American influence when compared with other Canadian universities. More than one out of every six students is American.

The university previously mandated that all students abide by a code of conduct called the Community Covenant, which was described as &quot;a solemn pledge in which members place themselves under obligations on the part of the institution to its members, the members to the institution, and the members to one another.&quot; As of August 2018, students are no longer required to sign the covenant.

The covenant bans sexual relationships outside of a marriage between a woman and a man, as well as behaviour such as hazing, verbal and physical harassment, dishonesty including plagiarism, theft or destruction of another&#x27;s property, the use of illegal drugs, consuming alcohol on campus, or consuming pornography.

A 2015 ruling in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that &quot;discrimination inherent in the Community Covenant extends not only to [LGBTQ] persons, but also to women generally; to those persons of any gender who might prefer, for their own purposes, to live in a common law relationship rather than engage in the institution of marriage; and to those persons who have other religious beliefs... Despite some efforts by TWU to contend that the Community Covenant does not operate in a discriminatory fashion, it is self-evident that it does.&quot; The court ruling noted that &quot;failure to adhere to the conduct imposed by the Community Covenant, carries with it serious consequences.&quot; The covenant mandated &quot;at a minimum, suspension&quot; for &quot;sexual intimacy involving persons of the same sex.&quot; The school&#x27;s board of governors voted on August 9, 2018, to make the Community Covenant optional for current and incoming students, effective at the beginning of the 2018–19 school year. TWU&#x27;s president at the time, Robert Kuhn (2014–19), said in a statement that the change was so that the university could be &quot;inclusive of all students wishing to learn from a Christian viewpoint and underlying philosophy.&quot;

Professors of the university sign a statement of faith annually. This policy has caused some controversy within academic circles, and was most recently covered in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. As in line with the students, a mixture of Christian traditions are represented. Orthodox and Hebrew professors are also on staff.

Approximately 80% of undergraduates enrolled self-identify as Christian. There are many Christian clubs, organizations, and ministries on campus. There is no compulsory participation in any religious liturgies. Students and clubs of other religious denominations are welcomed and supported. Nearly every resident hall has a Chaplain in residence. In the morning on every weekday there is Chapel, at which attendance is voluntary, and communion is offered on one Friday each month. Within the university Core, students are required four terms of Religious Studies. One term is allotted to a Survey of the Old Testament, and one to a Survey of the New Testament. Another term must be a class in Religious and Cultural studies.

Catholic Pacific College, formerly Redeemer Pacific College, is the university&#x27;s constituent Catholic college. CPC&#x27;s Glover Road Campus is adjacent to TWU. CPC is administered separately of the university, offers classes in Catholic studies and a liberal arts curriculum is taught by a Catholic faculty. Mass is also offered four times weekly.

===Student groups===

Trinity Western&#x27;s nearly 100 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests. In 2011, the university hosted 11 academic groups, four cultural groups, five &quot;issue-oriented&quot; groups, eight performing groups, six pre-professional groups, three publications, and 13 recreational groups. Greek life is not sponsored by the university.

Each year, the Foreign Affairs Society hosts a Model United Nations conference for high school students. The Trinity Western University Students Association is the elected government of the student body, and works as an aid and mediator between individual students and university administration, in addition to sponsoring several events throughout the academic year.

Members of the university&#x27;s chamber choirs are often invited to guest perform with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, performances which have been broadcast on a number of occasions on CBC Radio; as well, Trinity Western&#x27;s choirs have performed frequently with the CBC Radio Orchestra, the Vancouver Chamber Choir, and at venues including Carnegie Hall in New York and frequent performances at the Orpheum, Vancouver, and the Chan Shun Concert Hall.

=== Student media ===
The university hosts three student publications. &quot;Mars&#x27; Hill&quot; is the official student newspaper of Trinity Western University. It is funded by the TWU Student Association. The paper started as an underground newspaper in 1988, led by Bruce Beck, but was shut down by administration after only two issues. In 1995, it replaced the previous official student newspaper, &quot;The Today&quot;. &quot;Mars&#x27; Hill&quot; is published twelve times during the academic school year (September to May), coming out approximately every two weeks. About 2,000 copies are printed for each edition. &quot;Mars&#x27; Hill&quot; has won the Associated Collegiate Press National Pacemaker Award, considered the Pulitzer Prize of student journalism, for best non-daily newspaper in 2008 and 2010. It is a member of the Associated Collegiate Press and Canadian University Press.

Other student media on campus include &quot;[ s p a c e s ]&quot;, an annual literary journal, is edited and published by students each year, as well as &quot;Pillar&quot;, the university&#x27;s yearbook.

===Athletics===
Since its founding in 1962 Trinity Western has provided athletics for both women and men. Today, the university supports athletics at the varsity, club, and intramural levels. Its colours are gold and blue.

The university sponsors 11 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity sports. Teams compete in Canadian Interuniversity Sport, the top university athletics league in Canada, with teams competing in the Canada West Universities Athletic Association at the regional level. Varsity teams competing in U Sports include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, soccer, volleyball, track and field, cross country, hockey, and rugby. The basketball, volleyball, and hockey teams play their home games and matches at the Langley Events Centre. Trinity Western teams have won nine U Sports national championships.

=== International Programs ===
Trinity Western&#x27;s international programs offer students the ability to study all over the world for part of the summer, a semester, or a full year.

The School of Kinesiology has sponsored summer travel studies programs at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games in Beijing and in London, respectively. The School of Art, Media + Culture sponsors a summer program in Paris and London, and the School of Business sponsors a summer program in Ottawa and Quebec City. Various other summer programs are offered, such as coral reef biology in Hawaii, Biblical studies in Israel and the West Bank and Johannine literature in Turkey.

Additionally, in conjunction with the CCCU, the university offers 12 semester-long programs through the CCCU&#x27;s BestSemester initiative. Sponsored programs include African studies in Uganda, filmmaking and film studies in Los Angeles, India studies in Tamil Nadu, Latin American studies in San Jose, Costa Rica, and American studies in Washington, D.C.

Trinity Western&#x27;s research and exchange partnership with the University of Oxford enables qualifying students to study as a visiting student at Oxford for either a semester or a year. Exchange programs at Spain&#x27;s University of Salamanca and China&#x27;s Xiamen University are also available to students. Students may also make their own arrangements with the help of a faculty member to study at other universities in Canada or abroad as visiting students.

=== Laurentian Leadership Centre ===

The Laurentian Leadership Centre certificate program housed in Ottawa&#x27;s Booth House, a National Historic Site of Canada, offers the opportunity for third- and fourth-year students to complete a fully credited semester of study while interning at Parliament, or a political group, business, media firm, or NGO in the national capital. Internship placements regularly include the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Finance; and the Conservative, Liberal, and New Democratic parties; as well as, the Canadian Council of Chief Executives; Royal Bank&#x27;s Capital Markets division; CIDA; World Vision; and CPAC. The program is also available to visiting students of other universities.

=== OMADA Teambuilding ===
OMADA Teambuilding is a leadership and team building program housed in the School of Human Kinetics. The program uses experiential education and hands on learning for both TWU students and outside organizations. Started at the university in 1998, the Challenge Course was renamed OMADA Teambuilding in 2009 to better represent the diversity of the programs that were being offered.

==Campus==
The main campus is located in the rural Township of Langley, British Columbia, occupying on the edge of historic Fort Langley. Fort Langley, a former fur-trade post of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, was selected by Governor Sir James Douglas as the provisional capital of the newly established Colony of British Columbia in 1858. There is a residence hall on campus named in honour of Douglas. The campus is situated about 45 minutes southeast from Vancouver and about 2 hours north from Seattle.

Campus buildings vary in age and style from Hanson Chapel, completed in 1962 (the first building completed on campus), to the Robert G. Kuhn Centre, completed in 2022. Today the campus consists of 36 buildings and residence halls that house the university&#x27;s various departments and students.

The architecture on campus is inspired by British Columbia, Rural B.C., and the Pacific Northwest. Modern red brick covers Alloway Library, Larsen Atrium, and Stanley Nelson Student Centre at the main part of campus. Other significant buildings on campus include Robert N. Thompson Building which houses the Political Science, History, English, and Geography departments. The newly built and yet to be named Music Building is home to the School of Art, Media + Culture. The Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences are housed in the Neufeld Science Centre, which experienced a major renovation in 2011, and the Vernon Stromback Centre at the east end of campus. In total there are 33 buildings on the university campus.

During President Raymond&#x27;s tenure, the university built the Music Building in 2010, and in 2011 Fraser Hall and the Neufeld Science Centre received major renovations in 2011. In 2012 the Vernon Strombeck Centre received a significant interior and exterior renovation, and in 2013 the prominent Robert N. Thompson building was re-modeled... In September 2017, Trinity Western opened the first new dormitory in twenty-five years, as a result of rising enrolment.

Cafeteria meals are now served in an all-you-care-to-eat style, and three smaller venues around campus offer additional food services.

===Academic facilities===

The Norma Marion Alloway Library is the main library for undergraduate students, holding a circulation of over 300,000 books, 12,000 periodical subscriptions, and computer access to thousands more titles. The university archives house several special collections: the Mel Smith Archives, the Robert N. Thompson Archives, and the Lyle Wicks Papers, which chronicle Canada&#x27;s political history through the works and personal documents of these three political figures. The library also has a Korean collection.

The Faculty of Graduate Studies and seminaries each maintain their own individual libraries.

Wireless internet is available across campus.

===Athletic facilities===

Rogers Field is located on the northeast edge of campus, and is the home pitch to the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s varsity soccer teams. In 2008 Rogers Field was the host venue as the Spartans women&#x27;s soccer team won the CIS Championship. It also hosted the men&#x27;s CIS Championship in 2009.

David E. Enarson Gymnasium has been the university&#x27;s indoor sports venue since it was built in 1969. In 2009, the newly built Langley Events Centre replaced Enarson as the home of Spartans basketball and volleyball, and replaced George Preston Arena as the home of Spartans hockey. The LEC was the host venue when the Spartans&#x27; men&#x27;s volleyball team won the CIS Championship in 2011. Today, Enarson Gymnasium houses the university&#x27;s athletic offices and strength and conditioning room, hosts physical education classes and intramurals, and occasionally varsity sports events. It is also the new home court for the Vancouver Dragons of the Minor League Basketball Association.

Tennis courts, an indoor rock wall, and practice fields are also located on campus. Though the university does not sponsor rowing teams, there are rowing facilities on the Fraser River. The cross country and track and field teams train at the Township of Langley&#x27;s McLeod Athletic Park, the host park of the B.C. high school championships and the 2010 British Columbia Games. The Redwoods and Belmont golf courses are both located minutes from campus.

===Satellite campuses===

;Ottawa - Booth House
 The home of the Laurentian Leadership Centre in Ottawa is the Booth House, an historic mansion in Downtown Ottawa and a National Historic Site of Canada. Built in 1901 as the home of lumber and railway baron John R. Booth, Trinity Western purchased the building in 2000. Located on Metcalfe Street near Somerset, the campus is within minutes of the Parliament of Canada and many important governmental departments and embassies.

The Laurentian Leadership Centre program, an extension of Trinity Western University, offers third and fourth year students, and recent graduates, an opportunity to experience a fully credited semester of study as well as a Parliamentary, communications, business or NGO internship in Canada&#x27;s national capital, Ottawa, Ontario. Although the program is open to students of any major, it is primarily designed for those who plan a career in political science, business, communications, history or international studies. The program is also open to visiting students from other universities.

The LLC is located a few blocks away from Parliament Hill, Ottawa. The 20 students accepted to the program each semester take three academic courses in: Canadian Governmental Leadership, Ethics &amp; Public Affairs, and Law &amp; Public Policy. Courses are taught both by TWU professors as well as national and international leaders and guest speakers.

The internship program is the distinguishing feature of the Laurentian Leadership Centre. The LLC director places each student in an internship relevant to his or her academic or career interest. Internships fall into a number of categories: government, corporate, media, communications, and non-governmental. Previous internships have included: the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (which hosts one intern each semester), foreign embassies, offices of Members of Parliament and Senators, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mitel, World Vision, Make Poverty History, the National Arts Centre, RBC Capital Markets, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper, and a variety of others. Often these internships lead to full-time employment. Currently, there are several LLC graduates with positions in the PMO as well as in multiple ministries, political parties across Canada, and businesses from finance to high tech.

While participating in the program, students reside in an historic mansion on Metcalfe Street, the famous Booth House, which is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.

The current director is Dr. Janet Epp Buckingham.

;Bellingham
Located very close to the Canadian-U.S. border on the U.S. side, Trinity Western&#x27;s Bellingham campus provides adult degree completion Bachelor of Arts programs in leadership, psychology and the social sciences. Students meet one night per week and one Saturday per course. Upon completion of each six-week course in succession, students may work to finish their bachelor&#x27;s degree in as few as 18 months, depending upon the number of credits transferred. TWU Bellingham personalizes evaluation of students&#x27; past education and life experiences to recognize the skills and knowledge applied to degree requirements. Classes engage dynamic discussions, are learner-centred and success focused.

Trinity Western&#x27;s Bellingham campus also hosts the unique Freshman FASTTrack program, a one-year program of liberal arts core courses for new freshman. The program is designed to aid the transition from high school to university, transferring into the four-year college or university of their choice. Subjects are integrated to maximize interdisciplinary learning. Using the cohort model, small classes involve dynamic discussions and are supported with learning coaches. This concentrated immersion style of learning results in students completing a full 31 semester college credits attending morning classes, leaving their afternoons and evenings free to work or study.

;Richmond
In his 2008 state of the university address, President Jonathan Raymond announced the grant of a rent-free space to be used toward university education in Richmond, British Columbia. Opened in 2012, the university&#x27;s Richmond campus near Vancouver is the home of TWU-Extension, Trinity Western&#x27;s effort to help adults past the usual age of university complete their bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

==Controversies and Court Cases==
In November 2016 &quot;The Province&quot; reported on the school&#x27;s acceptance or lack thereof of LGBTQ students. According to the story, gay students were subjected to a culture of shame.

===Teaching certification program accreditation lawsuit===

In 1995, Trinity Western launched a teaching certification program, but the British Columbia College of Teachers denied accreditation of the university&#x27;s program, arguing that the &quot;Responsibilities of Membership&quot; agreement students must sign (replaced in 2009 with the Community Covenant) is discriminatory and that those graduating from Trinity Western&#x27;s program will discriminate against gay students. The lower courts in British Columbia and, later, the Supreme Court of Canada, ruled in favour of Trinity Western University, stating that there was no basis for the BCCT&#x27;s decision, and, moreover, that &quot;the concern that graduates of TWU will act in a detrimental fashion in the classroom is not supported by any evidence&quot;.

The final analysis of the case, as reported by the Factum of the Intervener, the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, was that &quot;In the circumstances of this case the Council of the B.C. College of Teachers failed to conduct such an enquiry and erroneously concluded that equality of rights on the basis of sexual orientation trump freedom of religion and association. They do not.&quot;

===Faculty of Law accreditation lawsuits===
Automatic accreditation of graduates from TWU&#x27;s proposed faculty of law were approved by most of the provincial law societies across Canada in 2014, except the Law Society of Upper Canada (now the Law Society of Ontario) and the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society.

==== Law Society of British Columbia Accreditation Reversal ====
On June 11, 2014, 3,210 of the Law Society of British Columbia&#x27;s 13,000 members voted in support of a resolution to reverse its decision to grant the faculty accreditation and requested that the province revoke its accreditation of the law program because of the view that it discriminates against unmarried couples and homosexual individuals. 968 members voted against with 8,822 not registering a vote. On September 26, 2014, the governing members of the Law Society decided to hold a binding referendum of their membership to determine whether to revoke Trinity Western&#x27;s accreditation. Just over 8,000 BC lawyers voted in the referendum, with 74% voting in favour of a resolution declaring that the proposed law school at TWU would not be an approved Faculty of Law for the Law Society&#x27;s admission program. Voter turnout was just under 60%.

==== Nova Scotia: &quot;Trinity Western University v Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society&quot; ====
The case was brought before the Nova Scotia Supreme Court from December 16–19, 2014. Trinity Western argued that denying automatic accreditation to TWU law graduates is an infringement on the students&#x27; right to freedom of religion.

The Court ruled in favour of TWU on January 28, 2015, accepting the argument that, as a private religious university, the school had the right to uphold its own code of conduct &quot;even if the effect of that code is to exclude... or offend others&quot; and attempting to force TWU to change its community covenant was an infringement on religious freedom. The ruling further noted that the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society already requires all lawyers to follow its Code of Professional Conduct, which forbids all discrimination, so the Community Covenant would not affect TWU graduates in their practice of law.

The NSBS appealed to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal heard the appeal in April 2016, and upheld the Nova Scotia Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling on July 26, 2016.

==== Ontario: &quot;Trinity Western University v The Law Society of Upper Canada&quot; ====
The case was brought before the Divisional Court of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice from June 1–4, 2015. Trinity Western argued that their proposed law school&#x27;s graduates should not be refused automatic accreditation in Ontario by the Law Society of Upper Canada based on the Community Covenant Agreement, claiming that the decision would violate TWU students&#x27; rights to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and freedom of association.

The Court ruled in favour of the LSUC on July 2, 2015, stating that its refusal to automatically accredit TWU graduates was a reasonable balancing of the Charter rights to equality and freedom of religion, and that the refusal of automatic accreditation was not a violation of TWU students&#x27; rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association. The ruling further noted that TWU graduates are free to apply independently to the LSUC for accreditation following their graduation.

TWU filed a motion to appeal with the Court of Appeal for Ontario in September 2015, and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling in favour of LSUC on June 29, 2016.

==== British Columbia: &quot;Trinity Western University v Law Society of British Columbia&quot; ====
The case was brought before the Supreme Court of British Columbia from August 24–26, 2015. The Law Society of British Columbia had argued that TWU forcing students to sign the &quot;Community Covenant&quot; creates an unwelcome atmosphere for LGBTQ students and, given the high levels of competition for law school seats in Canada, would effectively create a two-tier system in which LGBTQ individuals would not have equal access to limited law school spaces.

The Court ruled in favour of TWU on December 10, 2015, overturning the LSBC&#x27;s decision against accrediting the TWU law school and stating the LSBC did not &quot;attempt to resolve the collision of the competing Charter interests [of equality before the law and freedom of religion].&quot;

The LSBC filed an appeal of the decision with the British Columbia Court of Appeal on January 5, 2016, which was heard June 1–3, 2016. On November 1, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the previous decision, stating that LSBC&#x27;s refusal of accreditation was unreasonable.

==== Supreme Court of Canada Decisions ====
Both the Ontario and B.C. rulings were appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, the cases appeared on November 30 and December 1, 2017, respectively. On June 15, 2018, the Supreme Court, across four sets of reasons, ruled in favour of the law societies in 7-2 for both &quot;Trinity Western University v Law Society of Upper Canada&quot; and &quot;Law Society of British Columbia v Trinity Western University&quot;.

The majority decisions said that TWU&#x27;s Community Covenant would deter LGBT students from attending the proposed law school and that equal access to legal education, diversity in the legal profession and preventing harm to LGBT students was in the public interest.

<text>was a village located in Tamura District, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.

On March 1, 2005, Miyakoji, along with the towns of Funehiki, Ōgoe, Takine and Tokiwa (all from Tamura District), was merged to create the city of Tamura.

The area covered by the former village has been reclassified as a borough (町 &quot;-machi&quot; is often translated &quot;town,&quot; but the word &quot;borough,&quot; like 町 &quot;-machi,&quot; can mean either a division of a city or a town independent of any larger city: see the article on &quot;Borough&quot; for comparable usages) within the City of Tamura.

As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 3,175 and a density of 25.33 persons per km². The borough&#x27;s total area is 125.37 km².

==Landmarks==
Ohtakadoyayama Transmitter is an LF-time signal transmitter in Miyakoji-machi (都路町 is incorrectly called &quot;Miyakoji-cho&quot; in the external link). It is used for transmitting the time signal JJY on 40 kHz. It uses as transmission antenna a 250 metre tall guyed mast with an umbrella antenna, which is insulated against ground.

==Evacuation orders lifted Mid August 2013==
On 23 June 2013 during a meeting with evacuees from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents would be allowed to return to their homes mid August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsievert per hour, much higher than the government&#x27;s goal of 0.23 microsievert per hour. But the decontamination works in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, they argued that radiation exposures would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for people that would stay outdoors for eight hours a day. Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new-type dosimeter because they wanted the people to check their own radiation exposures, and in this way to take responsibility for their own safety.

Although billions of yen were spent in an effort to decontaminate some areas around the troubled nuclear plant. The effort was described as futile, and radioactive waste was not collected properly and disposed of, and sometimes dumped into rivers.
Tomohiko Hideta, an official of the Reconstruction Agency, said that it would be impossible to reach the official targets, and confirmed the offer of the dosimeters. However, spokesmen of the Japan Environment Ministry denied all, even when they were confronted with the existence of audio recordings of the meeting, that proved otherwise.

<doc id="877603" wikidata="Q7321960" url="?curid=877603" title="Rhythm of Youth">
<text>Rhythm of Youth is the debut studio album by Canadian new wave and synth-pop band Men Without Hats, released in April 1982 by Statik Records in Europe and Canada and in 1983 by Backstreet Records in the US. It propelled them to fame with its second single, &quot;The Safety Dance&quot;. It was released under the Statik Records label in Canada, distributed by Warner Music Canada (then called WEA Canada) where it achieved Platinum status for sales of 100,000 units.

==Release history==
The US releases of this album featured a different track listing, replacing &quot;Living in China&quot; with an edited version of &quot;Antarctica&quot; (the full version of which appeared on &quot;Folk of the 80&#x27;s&quot;) and including an extended 
version of &quot;The Safety Dance&quot;.

In 1984, the album was released on CD in Europe by Statik Records, featuring the &quot;Folk of the 80&#x27;s&quot; EP (albeit including the single edit of &quot;Antarctica&quot;) and the extended mix of &quot;The Safety Dance&quot; as bonus tracks. It was re-released on CD in Canada in 1997 by Oglio Records as part of a &quot;two-fer&quot; including &quot;Folk of the 80&#x27;s (Part III)&quot; and the single edit of &quot;Antarctica&quot;.

In 2010, the album was remastered and reissued in Canada by the band&#x27;s label, Bulldog Brothers, featuring the original US track list (with &quot;Antarctica&quot; replaced with &quot;Living in China&quot;) and including all the tracks from both the US and UK LP releases, plus a demo version of &quot;Ban the Game&quot; (known as &quot;Ban the Game II&quot;), an extended mix of &quot;I Got the Message&quot; and a club mix of &quot;The Safety Dance&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Cashbox&quot; called the single &quot;I Like&quot; &quot;a forceful performance, grounded...on songwriter Ivan Doroschuk’s sardonic vocal&quot; and particularly praised the production.

<text>Def Con Dos (meaning DEFense CONdition TWO) is a rap metal band from Madrid, Spain.

==History and style==
Greatly influenced by hip hop bands Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, and Run D.M.C., and rock band Siniestro Total, they started rapping over hip hop bases created by producer Julián Hernández (musician and singer of Siniestro Total). In their &quot;Segundo Asalto&quot; tape (1989), the sound still was basically hip hop, but they started using rock guitars.

Texts in their lyrics and in the manifestos enclosed with their records are highly offensive and complex, with many references to pop culture: pop music, Spanish folklore, news, publicity, cinema, literature and Spanish and American comics. &quot;Armas pal pueblo&quot; (1994) was probably the first album made in Spain with a Spanish version of the &quot;Parental advisory: Explicit lyrics&quot; label on the cover.

Partly due to their polemical texts, DCD did not get much coverage from mainstream media in their beginnings, with the exception of some programs in Radio 3, a station belonging to the government-run Radiotelevisión Española. This situation changed when Basque film maker Álex de la Iglesia appointed them for the main themes in his films &quot;Acción mutante&quot; (&quot;Mutant Action&quot;, 1993) and &quot;El día de la bestia&quot; (&quot;The Day of the Beast&quot;, 1995). Álex de la Iglesia also directed the videoclips for these songs.

They disbanded in 1999, but in 2004 announced the comeback of the band with all but one (Gautxito, one of the guitars) of the original members. Meanwhile, César Strawberry and Manolo Tejeringo, started a new project named &quot;Strawberry Hardcore&quot; in 2001, playing a classic melodic hardcore. They have recorded three albums: &quot;Lo que me da la gana&quot; (a maxi CD in 2001), &quot;Strawberry h/c&quot; (their first full-length album in 2002) and &quot;Todos vamos a morir&quot; (2007).

The current members of &quot;Def Con Dos&quot; are César Strawberry (vocals), Alberto Marín, Samuel Barranco, Sagan, Kiki Tornado (drums), and J. Al Ándalus (programming, producing and guitars).

In January 2017, César Strawberry was sentenced to a year in jail by the Spanish Supreme Court for remarks deemed as pro-terrorism made on Twitter between 2013 and 2014. Amnesty International cited his case as an example of the excesses being committed in Spain under anti-terror laws. César Strawberry branded the sentence as a &quot;political sentence&quot;. He said he received the sentence &quot;calmly&quot; and told that it &quot;confirms the suspicions that, as a citizen, I was having that in this country the justice system is extremely politicised&quot;, which is why he announced his intention to &quot;appeal everything he has to appeal&quot;, including European courts, to prove his innocence. &quot;I suspect that once again the European Court of Human Rights will have to call the Spanish Supreme Court to account and that we will make an international fool of ourselves that we could have spared ourselves&quot;, for whom the new ruling &quot;endangers democracy, as it institutionalises the politics of fear of expressing oneself and sows doubts about judicial impartiality&quot;. Finally, in 2020 the Spanish Constitutional Court declared that Strawberry&#x27;s remarks were protected under freedom of speech and therefore revoked Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, being Strawberry acquitted from all charges. In 2024, Marín competed on MasterChef España Season 12 ranking in 6th place.

<text>GE Healthcare Technologies, Inc. is an American health technology company based in Chicago, Illinois. The company, which stylizes its own name as GE HealthCare, operates four divisions: Medical imaging, which includes molecular imaging, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, women’s health screening and X-ray systems; Ultrasound; Patient Care Solutions, which is focused on remote patient monitoring, anesthesia and respiratory care, diagnostic cardiology, and infant care; and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics, which manufactures contrast agents and radiopharmaceuticals.

The company&#x27;s primary customers are hospitals and health networks. In 2023, the company received 42% of its revenue in the United States and 13% of its revenue from China, where the company faces increasing competition.

The company operates in more than 100 countries. GE Healthcare has major regional operations in Buc (suburb of Paris), France; Helsinki, Finland; Kraków, Poland; Budapest, Hungary; Yizhuang (suburb of Beijing), China; Hino &amp; Tokyo, Japan, and Bangalore, India. Its biggest R&amp;D center is in Bangalore, India, built at a cost of $50 million.

In May 2022, General Electric formed the company to own its healthcare division; it completed the corporate spin-off of the company in January 2023.

==History==
===19th century===
The company traces its roots to the Victor Electric Company, founded in 1893 in a basement by Charles F. Samms and Julius B. Wantz, previously employees of the assembly lines at the Knapp Electrical Works and Midland Electric Co. and then in their early 20s. They initially focused on supplies for the dental industry. At the time, they were a six-person operation. 

By 1896, one year after Wilhelm Röntgen&#x27;s discovery, Victor Electric entered the business for X-ray machines. The business grew rapidly and so, in 1896, the company moved into new premises three times the original size. This did not solve the space problems and the company made three office moves by 1899. By 1896, the company also made electrostatic generators for exciting X-ray tubes and electrotherapeutic devices.

===20th century===
By 1903, Victor Electric had outgrown its facilities at 418 Dearborn St. in Chicago and bought two floors of a building at 55 Market Street, Chicago. This was again only a temporary stop; by 1910 it was too small and the firm moved again in 1911 to a building at the corner of Jackson Blvd. and Damen Avenue. This was the first permanent home of Victor Electric Co. They stayed there 35 years and during this time, gradually acquired all the space in the building and several around it.

In 1916, the company merged with three companies: Scheidel Western, Snook-Roentgen, MacAlaster &amp; Wiggin. Victor&#x27;s two founders had key roles in the new firm; Charles F. Samms was company president and Julius B. Wantz was Vice-President of manufacturing and engineering.

In 1920, Victor was acquired by General Electric and was renamed VICTOR X-RAY CORPORATION. At that time, it was the largest manufacturer of X-ray tubes.

The merger of the Victor subsidiary and General Electric closed on July 28, 1926 and the company became &quot;General Electric X-Ray Corporation&quot;. The merger brought renewed vitality to the organization and Victor entered the foreign market with equipment sold and serviced in nearly 70 countries. In 1930, the Victor name was phased-out from all branding; however, advertisements did mention &quot;formerly Victor X-Ray Corporation&quot;.

Use of X-rays in industry for non-destructive testing of war materials increased during World War II. X-rays were broadly used as a medical tool for military services.

As the war ended, GE X-Ray Corporation continued to grow. Greater production capacity and greater expertise was needed in the core business of building X-ray tubes. Since the tubes were made from hand-blown glass, the decision was made to move the company 90 miles north to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in order to tap into the enormous amount of glass-blowing talent in Milwaukee&#x27;s beer-brewing industry. In 1947, the company moved from Jackson Blvd. in Chicago to a site in the city of West Milwaukee, which had been used for building turbochargers during the war. The street was renamed Electric Avenue.

In 1951, the corporate structure was dissolved and the name changed to General Electric X-Ray Department. This new name lasted less than 10 years as the department divested itself of its industrial X-ray business, widened its medical business, and took on the name of GE Medical Systems Department. One of the reasons for the name of Medical Systems was due to the increase in the electro-medical business, which began in 1961 with the introduction of patient monitoring equipment. By 1967 modular equipment was developed which was soon popular in cardiac and intensive care units. Early in 1960, pacemakers were developed in Corporate Research &amp; Development in Schenectady, New York, and in 1969 the Standby Pacemaker was developed.

In 1968, the Biomedical Business Section opened its first factory in Edgerton Avenue. Late in 1970 a surgical package was introduced and in 1971, equipment to monitor blood gasses during surgery was introduced.

Later in 1971, Biomedical opened a 9,000 square meter admin and engineering building opposite its factory and in 1972, the section was renamed The cardio-Surgical Product Section. With the growth of its medical business, the General Electric Company upgraded the department to The Medical Systems Division in 1971. Also in 1971, a major expansion programme was started and the Waukesha factory was planned. Work started in July 1972, and was completed in 1973.

In 1974, work on CT was started and the first CT machine was installed in 1976. In June 1980, the company acquired the CT scanner business of EMI.


In 1982, the company set up a joint venture with Yokogawa Electric. It changed its name to GE Healthcare Japan Corporation in 2009.

In 1983, GE Medical started investing heavily in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, investing nearly US$1 billion in a new plant in Waukesha. It developed the MR Signa, which became very successful.

The MRI magnet plant in Florence, South Carolina, was opened a short time later, giving GE its own magnet production. It underwent a $40 million expansion in 2017.

In 1983, the company split its dental and medical lines in 1983; Gendex became its dental imaging division.

In 1985 GE acquired Technicare from Johnson and Johnson. Originally named Ohio Nuclear (and in 1979, after another fusion, Ohio Nuclear Unirad), the name was changed to Technicare in 1982. Technicare (with headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio) had been producing a range of rotate-stationary CTs with an installed base in the thousands, as well as some X-ray diagnostic equipment and a nascent MRI product range.

Up to this time, the medical Systems Division had simply been divided into domestic and international, but in 1987 it reorganized into the three &quot;poles&quot; of America, Europe and Pacific.

In 1988, GE Medical Europe merged with CGR, a medical equipment supplier based in France, to form General Electric CGR Medical Systems. The European headquarters were moved from Hammersmith (UK) to Buc, Yvelines, near Paris.

GE Healthcare was incorporated in 1994. 

In 1992, GE acquired the Picker Service organization in the U.K.

In 1994, it changed the name in Europe from GE-CGR back to General Electric Medical Systems.

In September 1995, the company acquired Resonex, an MRI maker based in Fremont, California. 

In 1996, Jeff Immelt was named CEO of the company; he became CEO of GE in 2000.

In April 1998, the company acquired Diasonics Vingmed from Elbit Medical Imaging of Haifa, Israel, expanding its ultrasound imaging business.

In September 1998, the company acquired Marquette Medical Systems for $808 million.

In November 1998, the company acquired the Nuclear and MR businesses of Elscint, (then a division of Elron, based in Haifa, Israel), for $100 million.

In September 2000, the company acquired the remaining 50% of the ELGEMS joint-venture formed with Elscint in 1997.

===21st century===
In 2001, the company acquired San Francisco, California–based CT maker Imatron for $210 million. Imatron produced an Electron beam tomography (EBT) scanner that performs imaging applications used by physicians specializing in cardiology, pulmonology and gastroenterology. The Imatron business was later incorporated into GE Healthcare&#x27;s Diagnostic Imaging business segment.

In March 2002, the company acquired MedicaLogic, creator of the former &quot;Logician&quot;, an ambulatory Electronic Medical Records system, for approximately $32 million.

In April 2002, GE Healthcare acquired Visualization Technology, a manufacturer of intra-operative medical devices and related products for use in minimally invasive image guided surgery, based in Boston.

In January 2003, the company acquired Millbrook Corporation, maker of Millbrook Practice Manager, a billing and scheduling system for doctors&#x27; offices.

GE Healthcare IT later merged the two products into one, although the stand-alone EMR product is still available and in development.

In 2003, GE Healthcare acquired Instrumentarium, including its Datex-Ohmeda division, a producer, manufacturer, and supplier of anesthesia machines and mechanical ventilators. To satisfy regulatory concerns in the United States and in Europe, GE Healthcare was forced to divest Instrumentarium&#x27;s Ziehm Imaging mobile C-arm business, as well as its Spacelabs patient-monitoring unit.

In April 2004, the company acquired Amersham plc.

Also in 2004, GE Healthcare along with other healthcare companies built a research reactor for neutron and unit cell research at GE&#x27;s European Research Center near Garching (outside of Munich), Germany. It is the only such reactor currently in operation.

In 2006, Sir William Castell resigned as CEO to become Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, a charity that fosters and promotes human and animal research—in the United Kingdom. Former GE Medical Systems CEO Joe Hogan then became CEO.

In January 2006, the company acquired IDX Systems Corporation for $1.2 billion. IDX was folded into GE Healthcare Integrated IT Solutions, which specializes in clinical information systems and healthcare revenue management.

In February 2008, GE Healthcare acquired Whatman plc, a global supplier of filtration products and technologies for £363 million.

In July 2008, Joseph Hogan announced his intent to leave his post as CEO of GE Healthcare to take the role of CEO at ABB. John Dineen, head of GE&#x27;s Transportation division since 2005, was named CEO.

In March 2010, the company acquired MedPlexus. The company then offered its first electronic medical record product in a software-as-a-service platform.

In April 2010, the company announced it was investing €3 million in the Technology Research for Independent Living Centre (TRIL). The Irish centre seeks to enhance independence for elderly people through technological innovation.

In July 2015, the company partnered with the 2015 CrossFit Games to provide athletes with mobile imaging equipment.

In January 2016, the company announced the move of its global headquarters to Chicago effective early 2016.

In June 2017, Kieran Murphy was named CEO of the company, and former CEO John L. Flannery was named CEO of GE. 

In April 2018, the company sold several healthcare information technology assets to Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion.

In June 2018, GE first announced plans to spin off GE Healthcare. However, the plan was delayed after GE sold its biopharma business to Danaher Corporation for $21.4 billion.

In January 2021, the company acquired Prismatic Sensors AB, focused on Deep Silicon detector technology.

In May 2021, the company acquired Zionexa, focused on biomarkers for the detection of breast cancer.

In July 2021, the company integrated technology from Spectronic Medical to create artificial intelligence-based software.

In November 2021, General Electric announced it would split into three publicly-traded companies, with GE Healthcare being one of the three. The spin-off of GE Healthcare was completed on 4 January 2023.

In December 2021, the company acquired BK Medical from Altaris Capital Partners for $1.45 billion.

In February 2023, GE Healthcare acquired Caption Health, an artificial intelligence medical technology manufacturer headquartered in San Mateo, California, for $150 million.

In July 2024, the company acquired the clinical artificial intelligence business from Intelligent Ultrasound for $51 million.

==Criticism==
=== Gadolinium-based contrast agents ===
In 1994, GE Healthcare ignored advice of its safety experts to proactively restrict the use of its MRI contrast agent, Omniscan. It also tried to conceal evidence of its risks by telling its researchers to &quot;burn the data&quot;, as revealed during a trial opposing debilitated consumers due to its accumulation in multiple organs.

In 2009, GE Healthcare sued for defamation a radiologist at the University of Copenhagen Hospital who linked the uses of Omniscan to gadolinium induced fibrosis after 20 of his patients (from which 1 died) suffered from it after its administration.

In 2017, GE Healthcare opposed the European Medicines Agency (EMA) suspending the use of Omniscan (along other linear agents), despite evidence of the high cytotoxicity of gadodiamide and its likelihood to dissociate after deposition.

In a 2020 study, another MRI dye, Clariscan, was retained more in the cerebrum, cerebellum, kidney and liver of rats than those injected Dotarem, its original drug. Although the authors didn&#x27;t provide a possible explanation, differences in the chelation process of gadolinium ions (Guerbet&#x27;s process being patented) or quality assurance could be causes of increased retention in vivo.

===Low taxes paid in the United Kingdom===
According to a report in &quot;The Independent&quot; in January 2016, the company received more money back in tax benefits (£1.6 million) in the UK in the previous 12 years than it paid. Its UK operations are all ultimately owned by a holding company in the Netherlands. Tax paid was £250,000, 1.7% of its £14.3 million profit. The company employs 22,000 people in the UK.

===Overbilling the government===
In 2011, the company agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that a company it acquired in 2004, Amersham Health, violated the False Claims Act of 1863 by knowingly providing false or misleading information to Medicare, causing the government to reimburse Myoview at artificially inflated rates. By maximizing the number of times a vial of the solution was used, health care providers billed Medicare multiple times for the product. A whistleblower received $5.1 million in the settlement.

===Reliability of imaging system===
The company supplies a cloud-based imaging system to the East Midlands Radiology Consortium, which was described in October 2017 as breaking down, so that medical images had to be sent between hospitals by taxi.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hirono has remained relatively steady for the past 60 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Hirono was part of Mutsu Province, and was included in the holdings of Iwakitaira Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate of Edo period Japan. After the Meiji restoration, on April 1, 1889, the village of Hirono was created within Naraha District, Fukushima with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Naraha District became Futaba District in 1896. Hirono was elevated to town status on August 1, 1940.

===2011 earthquake and tsunami===
The eastern, coastal portion of Hirono was inundated by devastating tsunami flood waters following the magnitude 9.0 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami off its coastline on March 11, 2011. Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the town was included in the emergency evacuation preparation zone, as it was just outside the 20 kilometer exclusion zone; however, the town government recommended that all residents evacuate and all civic services were shut down. Although the central government advised that it was safe to return in September 2011, the town government maintained its evacuation recommendation until April 2012. The town hall reopened on March 1, 2012 in preparation for the return of residents and the radioactive decontamination of schools; however, a ban on agriculture remained in place. Residents were initially hesitant to return, with only 1,352 of the registered 5,005 residents having returned by February 2014. However, by the end of March 2020, the Hirono city government reported that over 88 percent of the former inhabitants had returned.

<doc id="877615" wikidata="Q1945647" url="?curid=877615" title="Montauk Project">
<text>The Montauk Project is a conspiracy theory that alleges there were a series of United States government projects conducted at Camp Hero or Montauk Air Force Station in Montauk, New York, for the purpose of developing psychological warfare techniques and exotic research including time travel. The story of the Montauk Project originated in the &quot;Montauk Project&quot; series of books by Preston Nichols which intermixes those stories with stories about the Bulgarian Experiment.

== Origin ==
Stories about the Montauk Project have circulated since the early 1980s. According to UFO researcher Jacques Vallée, the Montauk Experiment stories seem to have originated with the highly questionable account of Preston Nichols and Al Bielek, who both claimed to have recovered repressed memories of their own involvement. Preston Nichols also claims that he was periodically abducted to continue his participation against his will. Nichols, born May 24, 1946, on Long Island, New York, claims to have degrees in parapsychology, psychology, and electrical engineering, and he has written a series of books, known as the &quot;Montauk Project&quot; series, along with Peter Moon, whose real name is Vincent Barbarick. The primary topic of the Montauk Project concerns the alleged activities at Montauk Point. These center on topics including United States government/military experiments in fields such as time travel, teleportation, mind control, contact with extraterrestrial life, and staging faked Apollo Moon landings, framed as developments that followed the 1943 Philadelphia Experiment.

Both Peter Moon and Preston Nichols have encouraged speculation about the contents; for example, they wrote, &quot;Whether you read this as science fiction or non-fiction you are in for an amazing story&quot; in their first chapter, describing much of the content as &quot;soft facts&quot; in a &quot;Guide For Readers&quot; and publishing a newsletter with updates to the story.

The work has been characterized as fiction, because the entire account was fabricated by Preston Nichols, and to some extent, Stewart Swerdlow, who has consistently been shown to contradict his own backstory, and it does appear as if Swerdlow just wanted to become famous in the New Age Community, and establish a reputation for himself. 

==In media == 

In 2015, &quot;Montauk Chronicles&quot;, a film adaptation of the conspiracy featuring Preston Nichols, Alfred Bielek, and Stewart Swerdlow, was released online and on DVD and Blu-ray. The film won the best documentary award at the Philip K. Dick Film Festival in New York City and has been featured on &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

The Netflix TV series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; (2016) was inspired by the somewhat dubious Montauk Project, and at one time &quot;Montauk&quot; was used as its working title.

The Montauk Experiment was featured on a season 8 episode of Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries of the Abandoned&quot; on October 23, 2003. The episode, titled, &quot;The Montauk Conspiracy&quot; documented the conspiracies that &quot;swirled around an abandoned military base&quot; (Camp Hero) in Long Island. Experts discussed the critical role that the base played in defending America&#x27;s coastline.

<doc id="877616" wikidata="Q1145242" url="?curid=877616" title="M40 rifle">
<text>The M40 rifle is a bolt-action sniper rifle used by the United States Marine Corps. It has had four variants: the M40, M40A1, M40A3, and M40A5. The M40 was introduced in 1966. The changeover to the A1 model was completed in the 1970s, the A3 in the 2000s, and the A5 in 2009. 

Each M40 is built from a Remington Model 700 bolt-action rifle, and is modified by USMC armorers at Marine Corps Base Quantico, using components from a number of suppliers. New M40A5s are being built, and A1s are upgraded to A3s and A5s as they rotate into the armory for service and repair. The rifles have had many sub-variations in telescopic sights, and smaller user modifications. The M40A5 incorporates a detachable magazine and a threaded barrel to allow for the use of a sound suppressor or another muzzle device.

The original M40 was a military type-classified version of the Remington 700; it was factory-made, and had a one-piece wooden stock. The M40A1 and A3 switched to fiberglass stocks made by McMillan, with new scopes. The trigger pull on both models (M40A1/A3) is .

The Marine Corps plans to replace the M40 with the Mk 13 Mod 7.

==History==
During the Vietnam War, the Marine Corps decided they needed a standard sniper rifle. After testing several possibilities, they ordered seven hundred Remington Model 40x rifles (target/varmint version of the Remington Model 700 bolt-action rifle), and gave them the M40 designation. Most had a Redfield 3–9x Accurange variable scope mounted. With time, certain weaknesses, primarily warping of the all-wood stock, became apparent.

Sometime in the early 1970s, the USMC armorers at MCB Quantico began rebuilding the original M40s into M40A1s. The process involved, among other improvements, replacing the original wood stocks with McMillan A1 fiberglass stocks, as well as replacing the original 3–9× Redfield variable-power scopes with 10× Unertl fixed-power scopes. The M40 was originally designed by Jack Cuddy and Neill Goddard. The stock featured Wichita sling swivels and a Pachmayr buttpad.

The Corps began looking at a replacement for the M40 series in 2004, but did not draft requirements until 2009 while working with SOCOM. The plans for a &quot;21st century sniper rifle&quot; were paused while the Army&#x27;s results of SOCOM&#x27;s Precision Sniper Rifle program were finalized in 2013. The Marine Corps eventually decided to continue upgrading the M40A-series and keep the 7.62 NATO round, primarily due to the higher cost of larger rounds and scout sniper training that can achieve kills beyond the weapon&#x27;s effective range.

In April 2018, the U.S. Marine Corps announced they would be replacing the M40 with the Mk 13 Mod 7. The Mk 13 chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum increases range from 1,000 meters with the M40 to 1,300 meters, giving Marine snipers similar capabilities to the U.S. Army M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle.

==Variants==
===M40A3===
Development of the M40A3 began in 1996 and concluded in 2001, when it was placed into service during Operation Enduring Freedom. It served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and other subsequent conflicts. Though its designation would remain M40A3 until 2009, its exact configuration varied with time. Listed here is a description of the components used in the M40A3.

Action: The M40 has always been based on the Remington 700 Short Action with .308 bolt face, and this is no different in the M40A3. These actions are tuned by Marine armorers; the M40A1 trigger guard and floor plate was assembly manufactured by Winchester using the model 70 steel which was cut about one inch to fit the Remington 700 action and McMillan camo stock. DD Ross Company, though several M40A3s use Badger Ordnance trigger guards. In 2007, the Marine Corps began replacing the DD Ross trigger guard assemblies with the M5 detachable magazine trigger guard manufactured by Badger Ordnance.

Barrel: The barrel on the M40A1 was made by Bill Atkinson, this barrel is 24&quot; long made from 416 stainless steel, bead blasted and blued with black oxide. M40A3 is a Schneider 635; 25-inch, 6-groove, 1:12&quot; match-grade heavy barrel.

Stock: All service M40A3s are based upon the A4 Tactical Riflestock, a benchrest-style fiberglass riflestock made by McMillan Fiberglass Stocks and cast molded in an OD Green color. The action is glass bedded into the stock with aluminum pillars, while the barrel is allowed to &quot;float&quot; (it is attached only to the action), ensuring it is stress free during operation. The stock has adjustable length-of-pull (through a buttstock spacer system) and a Marine manufactured adjustable saddle-type cheekpiece. The stock also has six flush mount sling swivel cups, two on each side front and back and one each on the front and rear underside. One bipod stud is located on the underside of the forend.

Sling: The Model 1907 sling that has been historically used on M40A3s has been replaced with the Quick Cuff Model Two sling manufactured by Tactical Intervention Specialists.
Bipod: The M40A3s use a 6–9&quot; Harris notched swivel type bipod, model S-BRM, with a KMW Pod-Loc, which is a push button ratcheting bipod swivel locking mechanism.

Dayscope: The M8541 Scout Sniper Day Scope is a Schmidt and Bender Police Marksman II LP 3–12×50 modified by Premier Reticles. Starting in 2007, this model replaced the Unertl MST-100 10× fixed day scope. This dayscope is mounted with Badger Ordnance USMC M40A3 34mm scope rings, which use a standard ring in the rear and a wider MAX-50 ring in front. The standard front ring cap is replaced with a SPA-Defense B634 34mm Male Dovetail, as a mounting platform for the Simrad KN200 Night Vision Weapon Sight. The scope and rings are mounted on a DD Ross 30-minute-of-angle lugged Picatinny rail.

===M40A5===
The M40A5 superseded the M40A3 in 2009, though the evolution between the two systems occurred gradually over a longer period. The primary difference between the M40A5 and the M40A3 is the barrel: The A3&#x27;s target crown has been replaced with a threaded muzzle and straight tapered barrel allowing the installation of a Surefire muzzle brake and sound suppressor. All M40A5s are fitted with a Badger Ordnance detachable magazine system and a forward rail mount for the AN/PVS-22 night vision optic.

===Comparison===


===M40A6/A7===
On 25 July 2013, the Marine Corps released a solicitation for the M40 Modular Stock Program. Upgraded features are to include a folding stock, compatible with current M40 actions and barrels, to make the rifle more compact for transportation inside confined spaces like vehicles and a full-length rail to accommodate optics and accessories; the M40A5 has only a few inches of rail space beyond the scope for a night vision optic, so extending the rail length would allow more accessories to be attached, enabling snipers to put rounds on target under any conditions. Deliveries were to begin three months after the contract being awarded, with 1,100 stocks to be purchased to upgrade the entire M40A5 inventory. The resulting weapon from the program was originally to be re-designated the M40A6. Remington was awarded the contract in November 2014. The final product will be designated the M40A7 and was planned to be fielded by 2017. The M40A6 began fielding with Marine Corps in June 2016.

==Differences between M40 and M24==
The U.S. Army also used the Remington 700/40x action as the basis for its M24 Sniper Weapon System. The primary difference between the Army and the U.S. Marine Corps rifles is that while the U.S. Marine Corps M40 variants use the short-action version of the Remington 700/40x which is designed for cartridges having an overall length of or less (such as the .308 Winchester/7.62×51 mm NATO), the Army M24 uses the Remington 700 Long Action. The long action of the M24 is designed for full-length cartridges up to in overall length, such as the .30-06 Springfield, and magnum cartridges such as the 7 mm Remington Magnum and .300 Winchester Magnum, but shorter cartridges such as the 7.62×51mm NATO (the military version of the .308 Winchester) can also be used. The U.S. Army&#x27;s use of the long action was the result of an original intention to chamber the M24 for .30-06 Springfield. Despite the fact that the M24 came fitted with a 7.62×51 mm NATO barrel upon issue, retaining the longer action allowed them to reconfigure the rifle in dimensionally larger cartridge chamberings if necessary (which has been the case during the longer engagement distances during Operation Enduring Freedom). In 2014 the last U.S. Army M24 rifles were reconfigured to M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifles that are chambered for .300 Winchester Magnum. The barrels not currently fitted to the rifles are usually stored with the unit armorers. The U.S. Marine Corps M40A3 uses a Schneider barrel and the U.S. Army M24 used a Rock Creek 5R barrel.

<doc id="877617" wikidata="Q1354867" url="?curid=877617" title="Naraha, Fukushima">
<text>is a town located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an official registered population of 6,465 in 3,182 households, and a population density of 65 persons per km2, although the current actual resident population is significantly smaller. The total area of the town is . From 2011 until 2015, the town was evacuated due to fallout from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. While the town wasn&#x27;t severely contaminated by the fallout, restrictions on residency were held until September 2015 when cleanup efforts concluded, allowing people to return. Naraha is the first of several towns and cities near Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant to have been reopened to residents. Repair and reconstruction efforts have been underway in Naraha since 2016, and numerous landmarks in the town have been rebuilt and reopened.

==Geography==
Naraha is located in southern of Fukushima Prefecture, bordering on the Pacific Ocean to the east.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Fukushima Prefecture
**Iwaki
**Hirono
**Kawauchi
**Tomioka

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Naraha remained relatively steady for the 40 years prior to the nuclear disaster.
==Climate==
Naraha has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Naraha is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==History==
The area of present-day Naraha was part of Mutsu Province, and was included in the &quot;tenryō&quot; holdings of the Tokugawa shogunate during Edo period Japan. After the Meiji restoration, on April 1, 1889, the villages of Kido and Tatsuta was created within Naraha District, Fukushima with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Naraha District became Futaba District in 1896. The villages of Kido and Tatsuta merged in 1956 to form the town of Naraha.

===2011 earthquake and tsunami===
Naraha suffered great devastation as a result of the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami. As a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, as well as problems experienced with its cooling facility of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant (see timeline), the town was totally evacuated by order of the town government. The entire area of the town fell within the 20 kilometer exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant. On August 1, 2012, the government eased the restriction order by allowing residents to visit their homes during daylight hours, but not permitting overnight stays. In March 2014, Naraha completed decontamination work in its residential areas, although radiation levels remained high in some areas of the town, and many buildings were still in ruins. By April 2015, residents could stay overnight if they applied for permission, and the evacuation order was lifted completely effective September 4, 2015. Reconstruction efforts in the town commenced in 2016.
Naraha is listed among several neighbouring towns as a ‘special zone for reconstruction and revitalisation’; as repair works are underway, several key milestones were met in the years following the evacuation order being lifted. In April 2018, the town&#x27;s Elementary and Junior High schools were reopened, while in July, J-Village was fully repaired and opened to the public.

==Economy==
The economy of Naraha was formerly heavily dependent on agriculture. The Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant was also a major employer.

==Education==
Naraha had two public elementary schools and one public middle school in March 2011.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
JR East – Jōban Line 

===Highway===
* – Naraha Parking Area and Smart Interchange

==Local attractions==

<doc id="877625" wikidata="Q1023943" url="?curid=877625" title="Tomioka, Fukushima">
<text>is a town located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 1,326 in 5578 households and a population density of 19,4 persons per km², although the current actual resident population is considerably smaller than in 2010. The total area is .

==Geography==
Tomioka is located on the Pacific Ocean coastline of central Fukushima. It is the location for the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, owned by the Tokyo Electric Power Company.

The town of Tomioka is divided into two main districts, each with their own train station. To the south is Tomioka, which is the main area. To the north, on top of the hill, is Yonomori, a smaller and much newer neighborhood. Though the two areas operate under one government, physical distance makes them feel like two separate towns.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Fukushima Prefecture
**Kawauchi
**Naraha
**Ōkuma

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tomoka remained relatively steady until the nuclear disaster.

==Climate==
Tomioka has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Tomioka is 12.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1329 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.0 °C.

==History==
The area of present-day Tomioka was part of Mutsu Province. The remains of Kofun period burial mounds have been found in the area. During the Edo period, it was originally part of Iwakitaira Domain, but from 1747 was divided between Tanagura Domain, Tako Domain and &quot;tenryō&quot; territory directly under the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji restoration, on April 1, 1889, the village of Tomioka was created within Naraha District, Fukushima with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Naraha District became Futaba District in April 1896. Tomioka was raised to town status on March 1, 1900. It merged with the neighboring town of Futaba on March 31, 1955.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ===

Tomioka was severely affected by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. Besides sustaining considerable damage from the earthquake, and the tsunami (which devastated the coastal area), the town was evacuated en masse on the morning of March 12 as it is located well within the 20 kilometer exclusion radius around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Only one man, -year-old fifth-generation rice farmer Naoto Matsumura, with his dog, refused to evacuate, and remained behind to feed the pets and livestock left behind in his neighborhood with supplies donated by support groups.

On March 25, 2013, the nuclear evacuation zone in Tomioka was lifted by the central government, and the town was re-zoned into three areas according to different levels of radiation. However, the town government elected to keep the evacuation in place for at least another four years due to the need to rebuild damaged infrastructure. In the zone with the highest radiation levels residents will not be allowed to return home at least for five years. People other than registered residents are banned from entry. This zone, which covers the northeastern part of the town, had about 4,500 people residents. The central part of the town, which used to have 10,000 residents was designated as a residence restriction zone, in which the residents could return during daytime hours but have to leave at night. The remaining zone, which mainly covers southern Tomioka had about 1,500 residents, and remaining restrictions are expected to be lifted.

However, in a survey taken in 2013, some 40 percent of the town&#x27;s residents responded that they had decided never to return, and 43 percent were undecided. Concerns over radiation exposure, and the loss of compensation money from TEPCO should they decide to return, coupled with uncertainty over whether or not they could make a living in Tomioka were major issues. On April 1, 2017, the evacuation order was lifted for most of the town except for the northeastern areas, allowing many residents to return.

As of 2023, decontamination of the remaining areas of Tomioka is continuing to take place; an area of four square kilometres was decontaminated fully on April 2, 2023, accompanied by a statement by the Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, that pledged to fully decontaminate the town.

==Economy==
The economy of Tomioka is heavily dependent on commercial fishing and agriculture.

==Education==
=== High schools ===
Tomioka, Fukushima Prefectural HighSchool (founded in 1950) is the only high school in the town.

=== Junior high schools ===
There are two public junior high schools in Tomioka - Tomioka 1st Junior High School and Tomioka 2nd Junior High School.

=== Elementary schools ===
There are two public elementary schools in Tomioka - Tomioka 1st Elementary School and Tomioka 2nd Elementary School.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
 JR East – Jōban Line

===Highway===
* – Tomioka Interchange

==Local attractions==
=== Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant ===
The Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant is a nuclear power plant located on a site straddling Tomioka and Naraha, run by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the four reactors automatically shut down and the plant remains offline.

=== Hayama shrine ===
The main Shinto shrine in Tomioka is Hayama shrine where a fire festival was held to pray for a good harvest. The shrine is known as &quot;Number 33, the thirty-third shrine in a pilgrimage path which goes across the country.

=== Tomioka government office complex ===
This complex consisted of three buildings connected by walkways and a mini park. The center building was home to the city government offices. On the left side of the complex is a building that used to house a large auditorium and the city&#x27;s public library. The right side of the complex featured a small health center. The whole complex is located just north of where the Joban train line crosses Route 6 and is across the highway from the Tomioka Sports Center.

=== Yonomori Park ===
This park was very popular in spring when the cherry blossoms are blooming. Many locals came to view the blossoms and enjoy the festival atmosphere. During the Cherry Blossom Festival, there were many food, trinket, and game stalls. The town is famous for having one of the longest cherry blossom tunnels in Japan.

=== Tomioka Sports Center ===
Located between Route 6 and the ocean, this sports center contained multiple tennis courts and a baseball field, among other attractions. The facilities could be rented by the hour for a very reasonable price. Some local sports clubs met here.

=== Refre ===
Located at the intersection of the two roads with cherry blossom tunnels, Refre (リフレ) was a popular meeting place. Its facilities include a conference room with seating and catering for hundreds of people, a hotel, a fitness center, a hot spring, one indoor heated pool for lap swimming, and one indoor/outdoor pool for general use, though the second pool is closed during the winter months.

=== Tomioka Beach ===
During the summer months leading up to Obon, a beach is open for public swimming. After Obon, however, the beach is typically closed due to a large jellyfish population that migrates to the area in the summer. The beach is a short distance from Tomioka station.

<doc id="877627" wikidata="Q2914699" url="?curid=877627" title="Battle of Jutland order of battle">
<text>The [[Battle of Jutland]] was fought on 31 May and 1 June 1916, in the waters of the North Sea, between forces of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet and Imperial German Navy High Seas Fleet. The battle involved 250 warships, and, in terms of combined tonnage of vessels engaged, was the largest naval battle in history.

The Royal Navy had established a blockade of the North Sea at the start of the war and the German &quot;Hochseeflotte&quot; could not match the larger Grand Fleet. The German plan was to use the threat of an attack by their battlecruisers on British ports to lure the British battlecruisers into a trap where they could be defeated by a superior force of battleships without encountering the rest of the Grand Fleet. Aware of all German naval movements, the British fleet sortied to support their battlecruisers and bring the German fleet to battle. 

In the event, although more British ships were sunk or damaged, the overall strategic situation was unchanged.

==Summary==

===Ships present===

British capital ships carried a larger weight of broadside— compared to —than the German ones.

The German Navy&#x27;s torpedo boats were of similar size and function to the destroyers in the Royal Navy, and are often referred to as such.

<doc id="877631" wikidata="Q1354949" url="?curid=877631" title="Kawauchi, Fukushima">
<text>is a village located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. , the village had an official registered population of 1,861, and a population density of 9.5 persons per km². The total area of Kawauchi is . The village was evacuated as a result of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, but in 2014, all restrictions were lifted. It is located in Futaba district 

==Geography==
Kawauchi is located in the Abukuma Plateau of central Fukushima with a mean altitude of between 400 and 500 meters. North of Kawauchi, there is at a substation of Kita–Iwaki powerline, a 500 kV-line already designed for future 1100 kV operation.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Fukushima Prefecture
**Iwaki
**Naraha
**Ōkuma
**Tamura
**Tomioka

===Climate===
Kawauchi has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Kawauchi is 10.3 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1431 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around -0.7 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kawauchi has declined steadily over the past 60 years and is now less than half what it was a century ago.

==History==
The area of present-day Kawauchi was part of Mutsu Province. After the Meiji restoration, on April 1, 1889, the village of Kawauchi was created within Futaba District, Fukushima with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

===2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster===

Kawauchi suffered moderate damage from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. However, the eastern portion of the village is located within the nominal 20-kilometer exclusion zone of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and as a result of wind patterns following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the entire population of the village was evacuated by government order by May 2011. A portion of the village was re-opened in March 2012.

In August 2014, the government divided the remaining portion of the village into two zones, and projected a lifting of the evacuation order for 275 residents in one of the zones in October.

The ambient radiation dose was lower than that of the surrounding municipalities, and as of 2012, the average exposure dose among residents was reported to be below 1 millisievert per year. By 2017, more than 80% of the villagers had returned, but many were older and the younger generation had a lower return rate than the whole. It was reported that lifestyle-related diseases after the earthquake were increasing with the aging of the population. More than 100 Bq/kg of radioactive cesium has been detected in 76% of wild mushrooms collected between 2016 and 2019.

==Economy==
The economy of Kawauchi was formerly heavily dependent on agriculture.

==Education==
Kawauchi had two high schools (one public, one private), one junior high school, two elementary schools, and a kindergarten in March 2011. After the evacuation and re-opening of the town both high schools were closed. The junior high school, 1 elementary school, and kindergarten remain open.

Ōkuma has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Ōkuma is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==History==
===Early history of the area===
The area of present-day Ōkuma was part of Mutsu Province. 
While historical records are unclear, it is believed that the area of present-day Ōkuma was ruled by the Shineha clan beginning in the mid-12th century. Later, during the Sengoku period, in December 1492 the Sōma clan defeated the Shineha clan, and the area transferred to the Sōma clan&#x27;s control.

During the Edo period, the was established along the , also referred as Coastal Road (浜通り &quot;Hamadōri&quot;), in the area of present-day Ōkuma. The Iwaki-Sōma Road connected the region to Mito in the south and Sendai in the north. Modern-day National Route 6, which runs through Ōkuma, generally follows the same route as the Iwaki-Sōma Road.

===Creation of the municipality===
In 1888, the national government passed the , and in accordance with the act, on 1 April of the following year the villages of and were inaugurated as parts of the district of .

On 1 April 1896, the Shineha district merged with the district of to become the present-day district of Futaba. Over a half a century later, on 11 November 1954, the villages of Ōno and Kumamachi merged to form the present-day town of Ōkuma.

===From coal mining to nuclear power===
Beginning during the 1870s, coal mining became an integral part of the economy of the Hamadōri region. This continued through the beginning stages of Japan&#x27;s post-World War II rapid economic growth period, leading Fukushima Prefecture to lag behind the country as a whole in industrial and economic development. In the tail end of the 1950s, the prefecture began promoting electricity generation as a way to alleviate the economic problems on the horizon from the impending closure of the coal mines.

On 30 September – 22 October 1961 the town councils of Futaba and Ōkuma, respectively, unanimously voted to invite Tokyo Electric Power Company to build a nuclear power plant on the border of the two towns. In September 1967 construction began on unit one of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. By October 1978, units one through four, which are on the Ōkuma side of the plant, had been commissioned. Units five and six (on the Futaba side) were commissioned by March 1979.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster===

On 11 March 2011 the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami occurred, causing severe damage to Ōkuma and especially devastating coastal areas. The tsunami hit and flooded the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, located on the Pacific coast of Ōkuma, and set off the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. By the following morning, the Japanese government had ordered residents to evacuate to outside of a radius of the power plant. Many residents were evacuated to the nearby city of Tamura, among other cities.

Shortly thereafter Ōkuma set up a temporary town office in the . The temporary town office was later moved on 3 April to Aizuwakamatsu. Ōkuma residents had scattered to about 20 evacuation centers located in the cities of Tamura and Kōriyama and the towns of Miharu and Ono, and by 30 April approximately 1,800 residents had expressed the desire to also move to Aizuwakamatsu.

On 10 December 2012 Ōkuma modified the areas of the town under evacuation orders and permitted residents of select regions of the town to return to their homes. Within the first 19 days 104 residents returned, however other residents of Ōkuma, like some other communities in Fukushima, are &quot;starting to come to terms with a sobering realization: their old homes are probably lost forever, and they must start anew elsewhere.&quot;

In 2015, the town sought to develop a forested area for living by 2018. The seaside area of the town, which was once heavily populated, was intended to be turned into a nature reserve.

In April 2019, parts of Ōkuma were deemed safe from further radiation contamination. The BBC reported that around 50 people were scheduled to move back.

==Education==
Ōkuma has three public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government, and one public high school operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education. The operation of all schools remains suspended indefinitely.

<text>Cherokee () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Swain and Jackson counties in Western North Carolina, United States, within the Qualla Boundary land trust. Cherokee is located in the Oconaluftee River Valley around the intersection of U.S. Routes 19 and 441. As of the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 2,195. It is the capital of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, one of three recognized Cherokee tribes and the only one in North Carolina.

The community also serves as a tourist destination, with numerous campgrounds, motels, and hotels serving visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, with a major entrance to the park lying within the community. The Cherokee Historical Association runs the Oconaluftee Indian Village, a living-history museum, as well as the popular outdoor drama &quot;Unto These Hills&quot;, and is associated with the Museum of the Cherokee People. Cherokee serves as the southern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The Oconaluftee River flows through the town and is popular for tubing. 

==History==
Cherokee is the capital of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and part of the traditional homelands of the Cherokee people. In the 1870s, the Eastern Band purchased the land for what is called the &quot;Qualla Boundary&quot;. To continue the heritage of the Cherokee in the town, several signs for Cherokee&#x27;s streets and buildings are written in both Cherokee syllabary and English. As a census-designated place (CDP), Cherokee overlaps most or part of three of the seven communities of the Qualla Boundary: Painttown, Wolftown, and Yellowhill.

==Geography==
Cherokee and its surrounding Qualla Boundary is in the very mountainous Swain and Jackson counties. The highest elevation is Kuwohi at the border with Tennessee. Kuwohi is the highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Oconaluftee River flows through downtown Cherokee.

== Demographics ==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,195 people, 867 households, and 561 families residing in the CDP.

==Climate==
==Economy==
The EBCI negotiated an agreement with the state, and in 1997 opened Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee Casino for gaming. It has generated jobs and revenue for the tribe, providing money that the EBCI applies to its people&#x27;s education, welfare and culture. In 2005, nearly four million people visited the casino and generated a per capita profit of roughly $8,000 annually. Each member of the tribe is paid some annual income; the tribe reinvests other monies for health and related services, and long-term development.

Since the late 20th century, most manufacturing and textile plants left the area, moving their jobs offshore to lower wage areas, such as Southeast Asia. The regional economy suffered. Many of the Cherokee had to rely on jobs related to national park tourism and recreation, which provided work for about half of the year. Many tribal members had to rely on public assistance to survive during the winter.

==Tourism==
Cherokee is a tourist-oriented area, located at the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park and at the southern end of the Blue Ridge Parkway. In addition to the casino, it is the site of attractions such as: 
* Cherokee Botanical Garden and Nature Trail
* Trail to Mount Guyot
* Museum of the Cherokee Indian
* Oconaluftee Indian Village
* Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)
* Qualla Arts &amp; Crafts Mutual
* Oconaluftee River

Eastern Cherokee history, culture, and crafts are portrayed in the historical drama &quot;Unto These Hills&quot;, presented annually during the tourist season. 

The Cherokee area offers many campgrounds, trails and river adventures. It is also home to three roadside attractions with zoos: Cherokee Bear Zoo, Chief Saunooke Bear Park, and Santa&#x27;s Land.

The zoos have been considered controversial. Bob Barker, a retired game show host and animal rights activist, has called for closing the black bear zoos at these attractions.

Cherokee Wonderland and Frontier Land were two amusement parks that operated in the area in the late 1960s and into the early 21st century, respectively. The latter was converted into a water park before being closed to make way for development of Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee. When they were open, both parks featured their own narrow gauge railroads (named &quot;Cherokee Wonderland Railroad&quot; and &quot;Frontier Land Railroad&quot;).

==Notable people==
* Walker Calhoun – musician, dancer, and teacher
* Amanda Crowe – woodcarver and educator
* Raymond Fairchild – banjo player
* Charles George – Medal of Honor recipient
* Edwin George - folk artist and muralist
* Leon Miller – American football player and lacrosse coach
* Clyde Moody – bluegrass musician
* Stan Powell – NFL player for the Oorang Indians

==Education==
Cherokee Central Schools operates the K–12 public schools. Cherokee High School is the local high school.

The private elementary school, New Kituwah Academy, is based on language immersion in Cherokee.

Previously the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provided educational services, and in their schools students were not permitted to speak Cherokee.

== Popular culture ==
Scenes from movies such as &quot;Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier&quot;, &quot;Digging to China&quot;, &quot;Forces of Nature&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;Stroszek&quot; were shot in Cherokee.

==Media==
The &quot;Cherokee One Feather&quot; newspaper has served the community for decades.

<text>is a town in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an actual population of zero, although as of 2017, the official registered population was 6,093 in 2,301 households. The total area of the town is . As of March 2011, the entire population was evacuated as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. However in the decade since then, 3% of the town has been open to visitors and residents, with the first residents returning on a permanent basis as of February 2022.

==Geography==
Futaba is on the Pacific Ocean coastline of central Fukushima. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, owned by the Tokyo Electric Power Company, is on the southern border of Futaba in the neighboring town of Ōkuma.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Fukushima Prefecture
**Namie
**Ōkuma

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Futaba was relatively stable until the nuclear disaster. 
==Climate==
Futaba has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Futaba is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==History==
The area of present-day Futaba was part of Mutsu Province. The remains of Kofun period burial mounds have been found in the area. During the Nara period, it was the center of ancient Futaba District in Iwaki Province During the Edo period, it was part of Sōma Domain, ruled by the Sōma clan until the Meiji restoration. Town records indicate that over 700 residents of the region died due to a tsunami in the 1611 Sanriku earthquake. The area was the site of the Battle of Iwaki during the Boshin War.

On April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the villages of Shinzan and Nagatsuka were created in Shineha District, Fukushima, which subsequently became Futaba District in April 1896. Shinzan was raised to town status on February 1, 1913. Shinzan merged with Nagatsuka on April 1, 1951 becoming the town of Shineha, which changed its name to Futaba on April 1, 1956.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ===

Futaba was severely affected by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. Besides sustaining considerable damage from the earthquake and the tsunami (which devastated the coastal area), the entire population of the town was evacuated en masse on the morning of March 12, as it is well within the exclusion radius around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

On March 28, 2013, the central government rezoned the town into two areas according to level of radiation: in the first, people were free to go in and out but not allowed to stay overnight; in the second, all entry was forbidden because of elevated radiation levels that were not expected to go down within five years after the accident. However, only 4 percent of the town area zone was opened to daytime return of residents, and the town remained uninhabitable.

As of 2017, the Japanese government is leading a cleanup of the town, aiming for 11 percent to be livable by spring 2022. In March 2020, the town&#x27;s train station was reopened as cleanup efforts continued, and an area of habitability of around one square mile was established around the station. Services between Futaba and the neighbouring towns of Namie and Naraha commenced on March 14, 2020.

In 2022, resettlement of the town commenced when the first three residents to return on a permanent basis arrived. It is planned to increase Futaba&#x27;s population to 2,000 over the course of five years.

==Economy==
The economy of Futaba was heavily dependent on commercial fishing and agriculture. Raising of carnations was a major industry.

==Education==
Futaba has two public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government, and one public high school operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education. All schools remain closed.

<doc id="877639" wikidata="Q171447" url="?curid=877639" title="José Froilán González">
<text>José Froilán González (5 October 1922 – 15 June 2013) was an Argentine racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and . Nicknamed &quot;The [[Pampas]] Bull&quot;, González was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won two Grands Prix across nine seasons. In endurance racing, González won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in , also with Ferrari.

González is particularly notable for scoring Ferrari&#x27;s first win in a Formula One World Championship race at the 1951 British Grand Prix. He made his Formula One debut for Scuderia Achille Varzi in the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix. His last Grand Prix was the 1960 Argentine Grand Prix. González competed in 26 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix over nine seasons (1950–1957 and 1960) and numerous non-Championship events. In the 26 World Championship races, González scored two victories (the 1951 British Grand Prix and the 1954 British Grand Prix), seven second-place finishes, six third-place finishes, three pole positions, six fastest laps, and 72 points. He won the 1951 Coppa Acerbo, in 1954 the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Maurice Trintignant, and the Portuguese Grand Prix for Ferrari.

Physically well built, González was nicknamed &quot;The Pampas Bull&quot; (by his English fans) and &quot;El Cabezón&quot; (Fat Head, by his Argentine fans). His close friends, like Juan Manuel Fangio and Roberto Mieres, called him &quot;Pepe&quot;.

== Sixtieth anniversary tribute ==

On 10 July 2011, during the British Grand Prix meeting, González was honoured by the Ferrari team and the FIA on the 60th anniversary of Ferrari&#x27;s first Formula One World Championship race victory. As part of the celebration, Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso drove González&#x27; Ferrari 375 F1 for four laps of the Silverstone track. Later that day, Alonso won the British Grand Prix in his Ferrari 150º Italia.
==Death==
He died in Buenos Aires from respiratory failure, aged 90, after a downturn in health following a heart attack earlier in 2013.

<doc id="877641" wikidata="Q1023937" url="?curid=877641" title="Namie, Fukushima">
<text>is a town located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. the town has a population of 1,238 in 794 households, although the official registered population was 17,114 in 6853 households. The total area of the town is . The town was evacuated as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster—being directly downwind from the power plant—and was within the exclusion zone set up in response to the disaster. Following ongoing clean-up efforts, Namie&#x27;s business district and town hall have reopened, but access to more heavily contaminated western parts of the town remains restricted as decontamination continues to be carried out.

==Geography==
Namie is located on the Pacific Ocean coastline of central Fukushima.

===Surrounding municipalities===
* Fukushima Prefecture
** Futaba
** Iitate
** Katsurao
** Kawamata
** Minamisōma
** Nihonmatsu
** Ōkuma
** Tamura

===Climate===
Namie has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Namie is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Namie was relatively constant over the past 40 years until the nuclear disaster.

==History==
The area of present-day Namie was part of Mutsu Province. The remains of Kofun period burial mounds have been found in the area. During the Nara period, it was the center of ancient Futaba District within Iwaki Province During the Edo period, it was part of Sōma Domain, which was ruled by the Sōma clan until the Meiji restoration. On April 1, 1889, the village of Namie was created within Naraha District, Fukushima with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Naraha District became Futaba District in April 1896. Namie was raised to town status on March 1, 1900. The town expanded on May 1, 1956 by annexing the neighboring villages of Obori, Karino and Tsushima.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ===
Namie was severely affected by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. Besides sustaining considerable damage from the earthquake, and the tsunami (which devastated the coastal area), the entire population of the town was evacuated en masse on the morning of March 12 as it is located well within the exclusion radius around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. It was not searched for bodies until more than one month after the tsunami.

During the evacuation, many town residents took refuge at a community center in western Namie in the belief that seasonal winds would blow radiation from the plant in a different direction. However, a change in wind direction blew the plant&#x27;s plume directly at them, heavily contaminating that part of the town. It was revealed months later that the national and prefectural governments had known about the direction of the plume due to forecasts by the SPEEDI computer system, but had decided not to tell evacuees in order to prevent a panic. Tamotsu Baba, Namie&#x27;s mayor at the time, said the decision to withhold information from his town was akin to &quot;murder.&quot;

On 15 April 2012, the town of Namie asked the Japanese government for free health-care for its residents. To monitor the long-term health, the city would provide to all inhabitants health handbooks in order to keep a thorough record of all health checks and thyroid examinations. These handbooks were similar to ones used to monitor the health of the survivors of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These &quot;hibakusha&quot; health books were free from medical fees, and Namie asked the government to set up a similar program for the people in Namie. Of the seven other cities around the nuclear plant, Futaba town was also willing to take part in this program.

In April 2012, the government of the evacuated town of Namie bought a whole-body dosimeter. The device was installed in a temporary housing in Nihonmatsu, Fukushima, in order to monitor the internal radiation exposure and the health of the citizens of Namie. Some 50 people a day could be examined, a complete screening would take two minutes per person. Initial screenings of the whole population was planned to be finished at the end of the fiscal year 2012. In this way the town government wanted to offer a long-term monitoring program to the population. Another reason for this was the excessive exposure to radiation during the first days directly after the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when predictions from SPEEDI were ignored by the Fukushima Prefectural government.

On April 1, 2013, the nuclear evacuation zone in Namie was revised. Japanese authorities set three different zones according to different levels of radiation: in the first, people were free to go in and out, but not allowed to stay overnight; in the second, access was limited to short visits; and in the third area, all entry was forbidden because of elevated radiation levels that were not expected to go down within five years after the accident.

On October 27, 2016, a brand new shopping mall, Machi Nami Marche, was opened in the town, with the intention that it would aid the return of people to the area in the event that the evacuation orders were lifted. This construction project was completed around the same time as a similar project in the nearby town of Tomioka, also within the evacuation zone.

On April 1, 2017, restrictions were lifted on the first and second zones, allowing residents to return to those areas, although a poll indicated over half did not intend to do so. The areas are in the coastal portion of Namie, which holds the town centre. The majority of the town&#x27;s hinterland remains in zone 3, with access completely prohibited due to high residual radiation. On December 22, 2017, the area was listed by the national government as one of several special zones for reconstruction and revitalisation, alongside several neighbouring towns and cities in the vicinity.

Further decontamination work began in May 2018 as part of a plan to decontaminate 660 hectares by March 2023. This is 3.7% of the area where entry is prohibited.

On October 3, 2020, it was announced that Ukedo Elementary School, one of the town&#x27;s six elementary schools, was to be preserved as a museum and memorial to the events of the earthquake and tsunami. Though the building was in the direct path of the surging waters, prompt action by the school&#x27;s faculty ensured that there were no casualties, with all 96 students and staff inside the school at the time of the disaster successfully escaping to higher ground.

===2016 earthquake===

A 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Namie in the early morning hours of November 22, 2016. A tsunami warning was issued indicating waves of up to three meters.

==Economy==
The economy of Namie was dependent on commercial fishing, agriculture and food processing.

On 7 March 2020, the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field (FH2R), a 10MW-class hydrogen production unit, was inaugurated in Namie. The site occupies 180,000 square meters of land, much of which is occupied by a solar array; but power from the grid is also used to conduct electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen fuel.

==Education==
Namie had six public elementary schools and three public junior high schools operated by the town government, and two public high schools operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education. All schools were closed after the nuclear disaster. As of 2019, six pupils were enrolled at a new elementary school.

<doc id="877643" wikidata="Q1352137" url="?curid=877643" title="Katsurao, Fukushima">
<text>is a village located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. , the village had an official registered population of 1,387 in 475 households, and a population density of . The total area of the village is . However, in March 2011, the entire population was evacuated as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The evacuation order was lifted on June 12, 2016 for much of the village; however, the actual number of residents who returned is considerably less than the official population numbers.

==Geography==
Katsurao is located in the Abukuma Plateau of central Fukushima in the Tōhoku region of northern Japan, with a mean altitude of over .

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Fukushima Prefecture
**Namie
**Nihonmatsu
**Tamura

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Katsurao was relatively constant over the past 40 years until the nuclear disaster. 
==Climate==
Katsurao has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Katsurao is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==History==
The area of present-day Katsurao was part of Mutsu Province. The remains of Kofun period burial mounds have been found in the area. During the Nara period, it was part of ancient Futaba District in Iwaki Province. During the Edo period, it was part of Sōma Domain, ruled by the Sōma clan until the Meiji restoration. After the Meiji restoration, on April 1, 1889, the village of Katsurao was created within Futaba District, Fukushima with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

===2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster===

Although Katsurao escaped significant damage from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, it was located downwind of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Although outside the nominal exclusion zone, as a result of wind patterns following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the entire population of the village was evacuated by government order by May 2011. In March 2013, the government divided the village into three zones, with the majority of the village area cleared for unrestricted return of its inhabitants by spring of 2014, a smaller area cleared for daylight return only, and a larger area in which the existing restrictions against entry would be maintained until at least 2017.
 However, in March 2014, the government postponed lifting of the restrictions on return for a year due to remaining high levels of radiation. On June 12, 2016, the evacuation order was lifted for approximately two-thirds of the village area, with the mountainous region bordering neighbouring Namie remaining restricted due to high residual radiation.

==Economy==
The economy of Katsurao was formerly heavily dependent on agriculture.

==Education==
Katsurao had one public elementary school and one public junior high school operated by the village government in March 2011. The elementary school remains closed. The village did not have a public high school.

<text>is a village located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. , the village had an actual population of 1,408, and a population density of 6.1 persons per km2. The registered population per village government records was 5,946 registered residents in 1807 households as of September 30, 2017. The total area the village is .

==Geography==
Iitate is located in the Abukuma Plateau of northeastern Fukushima at a mean altitude of 500 meters. It is about northwest of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Fukushima Prefecture
**Date
**Kawamata
**Minamisōma
**Namie
**Sōma

===Climate===
Iitate has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Iitate is 10.2 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1359 mm with September as the wettest month.The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.9 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.2 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Iitate peaked in the mid-1950s and has been decline since.
==History==
The area of present-day Iitate was part of Mutsu Province. During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Sōma Domain. After the Meiji restoration, on April 1, 1889, the villages of Iiso, Osu and Niitate were created within Sōma District, Fukushima with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. On April 1, 1942, Osu and Niitate merged to form the village of Odate, which then merged with Iiso on September 30, 1956 to form Iitate. In September 2010, Iitate was designated one of The Most Beautiful Villages in Japan.

===2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster===

Iitate suffered from moderate damage from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, and was located outside the nominal radiation exclusion zone of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. However, as a result of wind patterns following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, on 30 March 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that its operational criteria for evacuation were exceeded in Iitate, despite the village being outside the existing radiation exclusion zone around the plant. As a result, the entire population of the village was evacuated by government order on 22 April 2011. Some displaced children from the village were shunned after relocating for fear of contamination. In early June about 1,500 residents remained. By August, only about 120 residents, mostly elderly, remained.

In 2012, local government obtained responses from a survey from some 1,743 former residents began experiencing growing frustration and instability due to the nuclear crisis and an inability to return to the lives they were living before the disaster. Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating.
Summarizing all responses to questions related to evacuees&#x27; current family status, one-third of all surveyed families live apart from their children, while 50.1 percent live away from other family members (including elderly parents) with whom they lived before the disaster. The survey also showed that 34.7 percent of the evacuees have suffered reductions in income of 50 percent or more since the outbreak of the nuclear disaster. A total of 36.8 percent reported a lack of sleep, while 17.9 percent reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated.
In March 2012, the village was divided into three zones: in the first, people were free to go in and out but not allowed to stay overnight; in the second, access was limited to short visits; and in the third area, all entry was forbidden because of elevated radiation levels that were not expected to go down within five years after the accident. All restrictions were to be lifted for a small area of northern Iitate, but the majority of the village was cleared only for the daylight return of residents. The majority of the village was to remain totally closed until at least 2016. However, in March 2014, the government postponed lifting of the restrictions on return for a year due to remaining high levels of radiation.

The evacuation order was lifted on April 1, 2017, with the exception of a small area in southern Iitate bordering on the neighbouring town of Namiie, which remains a no-entry zone. However, only a third of the former residents expressed an intention of returning.

==Economy==
The economy of Iitate was formerly heavily dependent on agriculture.

==Education==
Iitate had three public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the village, and one high school operated by the Fukushima Board of Education in March 2011. All schools were closed with the evacuation of the village in March 2011.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
*Iitate does not have any passenger train services.

<text>Dragging Canoe (ᏥᏳ ᎦᏅᏏᏂ, pronounced &quot;Tsiyu Gansini&quot;, – February 29, 1792) was a Cherokee red (or war) chief who led a band of Cherokee warriors who resisted colonists and United States settlers in the Upper South. During the American Revolution and afterward, Dragging Canoe&#x27;s forces were sometimes joined by Upper Muskogee, Chickasaw, Shawnee, and Indians from other tribes, along with British Loyalists, and agents of France and Spain. The Cherokee American Wars lasted more than a decade after the end of the American Revolutionary War.

During that time, Dragging Canoe became the preeminent war leader among the Indians of the southeast. He served as war chief, or &quot;skiagusta&quot;, of the group known as the Chickamauga Cherokee (or &quot;Lower Cherokee&quot;), from 1777 until his death in 1792.

==Biography==
Tsiyu Gansini was born about 1738. Dragging Canoe was the son of Attakullakulla (&quot;Tsalagi&quot;, or &quot;Little Carpenter&quot;)—a Nipissing head-man—and &quot;Nionne Ollie&quot; (&quot;Tame Doe&quot;). Many members of these two Native American groups then lived with the Cherokee and had adapted to Cherokee society. Attakullakulla, Dragging Canoe&#x27;s father, was born to the Nipissing near Lake Superior. His mother had been born to the Natchez but was adopted as a daughter by Cherokee Chief Oconostota&#x27;s wife.

Dragging Canoe&#x27;s family lived with the Overhill Cherokee on the Little Tennessee River in what is now southeast Tennessee. He survived smallpox at a young age, which left his face marked. Dragging Canoe&#x27;s brother, The Badger, also became a Cherokee chief.

According to Cherokee legend, he was given his name because of an incident in his childhood. When he wanted to join a war party moving against the Shawnee, his father said that he could accompany the war party as long as he could carry his canoe. The youth tried to prove his readiness for war but could only drag the heavy canoe.

===War chief of the Cherokee===
Dragging Canoe had his first experience in actual combat during the Anglo-Cherokee War. In its aftermath, he was recognized as one of the strongest opponents to encroachment by white colonists onto Cherokee territories. Eventually, he became the headman of Mialoquo (&quot;Great Island Town&quot;, &quot;Amoyeli Egwa&quot; in the Cherokee language) on the Little Tennessee River. When the Cherokee chose to ally with the British against the colonists at the onset of the Revolutionary War, Dragging Canoe was eager to fight and was assigned to be at the head of one of the major forces of the three-pronged attack which opened the war with the frontiersmen of the Overmountain settlements, with his force attacking Heaton&#x27;s station in the Battle of Island Flats. Dragging Canoe barely survived the battle.

===Establishment of the Chickamauga towns===
Following the colonial militias&#x27; counterattacks in late summer and fall 1776—which destroyed the Cherokee Middle, Valley, and Lower Towns in Tennessee and the Carolinas—his father and Oconostota sued for peace. Opposing his father&#x27;s counsel and refusing to admit defeat, Dragging Canoe led a band of about 500 Overhill Cherokee out of the towns, and they settled further south. This occurred in early 1777. The group migrated along the Tennessee River to the area seven miles upstream from where the South Chickamauga Creek joins the Tennessee, in the vicinity of present-day Chattanooga. Thereafter, frontiersman referred to them as the &quot;Chickamauga&quot; because of their settlement by the creek. They established 11 towns, including one later referred to as &quot;Old Chickamauga Town.&quot; This was across the river from the trading post of a Scotsman—who was the assistant superintendent of the British concerns in the region—John McDonald. McDonald regularly supplied the Chickamauga with guns, cannons, ammunition, and supplies to fight the American colonists.

In spring of 1779, American pioneer Evan Shelby led an expedition of frontiersmen from Virginia and North Carolina to destroy Dragging Canoe&#x27;s Chickamauga towns. Shelby reported their success in a letter to Patrick Henry, saying &quot;...[ the Chickamauga Cherokee ] are reduced to a Sense of their Duty and a Willingness to treat for peace with the united States...&quot;

In 1782, for the second time since the wars&#x27; beginning, Cherokee towns were specifically attacked by a large United States force. The devastation caused by Colonel John Sevier&#x27;s troop forced the band to move even further down the Tennessee River. Dragging Canoe established the &quot;Five Lower Towns&quot; below the natural obstructions of the Tennessee River Gorge. These were: Running Water Town (now Whiteside), Nickajack Town (near the cave of the same name), Long Island (on the Tennessee River), Crow Town (at the mouth of Crow Creek), and Lookout Mountain Town (at the current site of Trenton, Georgia). Following this move, this band was alternatively referred to as the &quot;Lower Cherokee.&quot;

From his base at Running Water Town, Dragging Canoe led attacks on white settlements all over the American Southeast, especially against American colonists on the Holston, Watauga, and Nolichucky rivers in eastern Tennessee. After 1780, he also attacked settlements in the Cumberland River area, the Mero and Washington Districts, the Republic of Franklin, the Middle Tennessee areas, and raided into Kentucky and Virginia as well. His three brothers, Little Owl, the Badger, and Turtle-at-Home, often fought with his forces.

==Death==
Dragging Canoe died February 29, 1792, at Running Water Town, from exhaustion (or possibly a heart attack) after dancing all night celebrating the recent conclusion of an alliance with the Muskogee and the Choctaw. The Chickamauga were also celebrating a recent victory by one of their war bands against the Cumberland settlements. He was succeeded as chief by John Watts.

==Legacy==
Historians such as John P. Brown in &quot;Old Frontiers&quot;, and James Mooney in his early ethnographic book, &quot;Myths of the Cherokee&quot;, consider him a role model for the younger Tecumseh, who was a member of a band of Shawnee living with the Chickamauga and taking part in their wars. In &quot;Tell Them They Lie&quot;, a book written by a direct descendant of Sequoyah named Traveller Bird, both Tecumseh and Sequoyah are stated to have been among his young warriors.

<doc id="877681" wikidata="Q7455520" url="?curid=877681" title="Serutan">
<text>Serutan was an early fiber-type laxative product that was widely promoted on U.S. radio and television from the 1930s through the 1960s. Serutan was folded into Pharmaceuticals Inc.&#x27;s 1957 acquisition of J. B. Williams Co., founded in 1885. J. B. Williams Co. was bought out by Nabisco in 1971, where it continued to operate as a separate subsidiary until Nabsico sold it to Beecham Group in 1982 after nearly a decade of slumping sales.

The origin of the brand name was straightforward. The makers merely decided to spell &quot;natures&quot; backwards, and &quot;Read it backwards&quot; was the product&#x27;s advertising slogan. This was to differentiate it as being a &quot;natural&quot; product as opposed to laxative brands which stimulated the colon by chemical action. 

The product was almost uniformly promoted on programs whose core audience was known to be considerably older than the typical television viewer. Serutan is especially associated with &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; and &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot;, both of which were also sponsored by J. B. Williams products Sominex, a sleeping pill, and Geritol, a vitamin supplement. Serutan was the target of numerous jokes by Bob Hope and other radio comedians during the 1930s and 1940s.

==In popular culture==
A friend of the protagonist of J. P. Donleavy&#x27;s &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; refers to himself as the &quot;Acting Duke of Serutan.&quot;

In Harvard Lampoon&#x27;s &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, the parody version of Saruman is named Serutan.

In &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Doon&quot;, the parody version of Princess Irulan is named Princess Serutan.

Don De Lillo&#x27;s &quot;Libra&quot; mentions the slogan in its first chapter.

In &quot;Exit the Body&quot;, a play by Fred Carmichael, Kate Bixley refers to the protagonist&#x27;s husband, who writes a newspaper column under the alias &quot;Dorothy Duckworth&quot; and is attending a convention for lonely-hearts column writers, as &quot;The only female at the convention who &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; take Serutan.&quot;

A running gag in the 1944-1945 season of the Jack Benny radio show was a series of commercials by Frank Nelson for &quot;Sympathy Soothing Syrup&quot;, which used the slogan &quot;Sympathy spelled backwards is Yhtapmys.&quot; Several variations were introduced, most notably the rival brand, Sdrawrof cream.

In the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon &quot;Rocket-Bye Baby,&quot; a telegram from the planet Mars is signed Sir U. Tan of Mars.

Archaeologist Kent Flannery has used the term &quot;Serutan&quot; to describe systemic archaeologists. (Flannery 1973a:49-53)

An &quot;Animaniacs&quot; stinger has the Warners say, &quot;Yakko spelled backwards is Okkay!&quot;

<text>Carroll University is a private university in Waukesha, Wisconsin, United States. It was established in 1846 as Wisconsin&#x27;s first four-year institution of higher learning. The university is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).

==History==
Prior to its establishment, what is now Carroll University was Prairieville Academy which was founded in 1841. Its charter—named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence—was passed into law by the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature on January 31, 1846. During the 1860s, the American Civil War and financial difficulty caused Carroll to temporarily suspend operations.

The board of trustees voted unanimously to change the institution&#x27;s name from Carroll College to Carroll University effective July 1, 2008.

===Presidents===
*John Adams Savage: 1850–1863
*Rensellaer B. Hammond: 1863–1864
*Walter L. Rankin: 1866–1871*, 1893–1903
*Wilbur Oscar Carrier: 1903–1917
*Herbert Pierpoint Houghton: 1918–1920
*William Arthur Ganfield: 1921–1939
*Gerrit T. Vander Lugt: 1940–1946
*Nelson Vance Russell: 1946–1951
*Robert D. Steele: 1952–1967
*John T. Middaugh: 1967–1970
*Robert V. Cramer: 1971–1988
*Dan C. West: 1988–1992
*Frank S. Falcone: 1993–2006
*Douglas N. Hastad: 2006–2017
*Cindy Gnadinger: 2017-
* Between July 31, 1871, and June 22, 1893, no college work was carried on. While the charter retained the college privileges, teaching was on the academy level. College work was resumed and the office of the presidency was filled again in 1893.

==Campus==

The campus is home to a variety of nineteenth and early 20th century historical buildings, including Sneeden House (a 1922 colonial home now used as a guesthouse and conference center) and MacAllister Hall (a renovated, 19th-century mansion that now houses offices for the CFO, English, modern language, computational and physical sciences, chemistry, and the Division of Arts and Sciences).

==Academics==
Carroll University offers more than 95 areas of study at the undergraduate level, with master&#x27;s degrees and certificates in selected subjects, as well as one clinical doctorate program in physical therapy. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on number, out of 580 graduates in 2022, were:
*Exercise Science and Kinesiology (105)
*Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse (100)
*Psychology (37)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (36)
*Business Administration and Management (33)
*Elementary Education and Teaching (31)

Carroll University ranked 31st in Regional Universities Midwest in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022 America&#x27;s Best Colleges. In 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Carroll 594th among 650 colleges in the United States. In 2018, &quot;Money Magazine&quot; ranked Carroll 613th among 727 colleges in the United States.

==Traditions==
Since the 1960s, bagpipes have been a part of Carroll&#x27;s opening convocation and commencement ceremony. Freshmen are escorted to their first assembly by a lone bagpiper, and upon graduation are led to commencement by a band of bagpipers.

==Athletics==
Carroll athletic teams are the Pioneers. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) since the 2016–17 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1955–56 to 1992–93.

Carroll competes in 23 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

The college football program at Carroll began in the late 1890s. Past head coaches include Glenn Thistlethwaite, Vince DiFrancesca, and Matty Bell. The current coach is Mike Budziszewski, who replaced Mark Krzykowski after the 2019 season.

== Student newspaper ==
&quot;The New Perspective&quot; (TNP) is a student newspaper at Carroll University. The paper is published every other Tuesday during the academic year, except during holidays, semester breaks, and exam periods. Its circulation is 1,500. &quot;The New Perspective&quot; is free and distributed throughout the campus and city. The paper was founded in 1874 as the &quot;Carroll Echo&quot;. In 1968, the name of the paper was changed to &quot;The Perspective&quot;. In 1976, Gary Stevens, the faculty advisor for the newspaper, suggested the editor-in-chief position be replaced with an editorial staff. The Student Senate approved the idea. With this change came another name change, to &quot;The New Perspective&quot;.

==Notable faculty==
* Cardon V. Burnham, composer
* Edward Daniels, abolitionist &amp; U.S. Civil War cavalry officer
* Jeffrey Douma, current Yale University music professor and choir director
* Edward Payson Evans, historian &amp; linguist

<doc id="877691" wikidata="Q6948435" url="?curid=877691" title="Myron Floren">
<text>Myron Floren (November 5, 1919 – July 23, 2005) was an American musician best known as the accordionist on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; between 1950 and 1980. Floren came to prominence primarily from his regular appearances on the weekly television series in which Lawrence Welk dubbed him as &quot;the happy Norwegian,&quot; which was also attributed to Peter Friello.

Floren was highly regarded by Lawrence Welk, who was an accomplished accordion player in his own right. Floren functioned as Welk&#x27;s principal assistant and second-in-command. In Floren&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Accordion Man&quot;, written with his daughter Randee Floren, he recalled handling road manager duties when the band traveled, including hotel arrangements and other logistics. Prior to his death, he hosted some of the repeats of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; on PBS.

== Early years ==
Floren was born to Ole and Tillie Florence. A first-generation American of Norwegian immigrant parentage, he grew up on a farm near Roslyn in Day County, South Dakota with two brothers, Arlie and Duane (a.k.a. Dewey), and four sisters, Valborg, Genevieve, Virginia, and Gloria. Before Myron played the accordion he had piano lessons from Dorothy Swenson, his music teacher, who identified with Myron because she also had had rheumatic fever. He took up playing the accordion at the age of six when his father bought him a $10 mail-order squeezebox. He taught himself how to play the instrument. He often spent several hours a day using his own methods of study. Soon he was performing solo around the community, often at fairs and social events.

After suffering from rheumatic fever as a child, his accordion playing saved his life, as the exertion strengthened his heart back to pre-fever performance. At a 1980 performance at Norsk Høstfest in Minot, North Dakota, Floren mentioned that he had a heart valve replacement (from a pig&#x27;s heart) two years earlier.

He worked his way through Augustana College in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, by working at radio station KSOO as &quot;The Melody Man&quot; and teaching accordion in the area. He tried to enlist in the Army when the United States entered World War II, but was turned down for active duty because of heart damage caused by the rheumatic fever he had suffered as a child.

However, he insisted on serving his country by joining the USO, performing in Europe with notable stars such as Lily Pons and Marlene Dietrich. After the war, he returned home to South Dakota, where he married Berdyne Koerner in 1945. The couple eventually had five daughters and gained three sons-in-law and seven grandchildren. Bobby Burgess from the Welk show was one of his sons-in-law.

== Years with Lawrence Welk ==
In 1950, Floren, who was performing with a music group known as &quot;The Buckeye Four&quot;, went to a dance at the Casa Loma Ballroom in St. Louis, Missouri at which the Lawrence Welk Orchestra was then playing. When the maestro recognized the accordion virtuoso in the audience, he invited him to play a number with his band. The number turned out to be &quot;Lady of Spain&quot;, and from the overwhelming positive response from the audience, Lawrence hired Myron to be a permanent member of his band. &quot;Lady of Spain&quot; also became Floren&#x27;s trademark song and he played it countless times on the Welk show.

Although Floren&#x27;s musical technique made him a much better accordion player than Welk, the two men developed a close working relationship, and Welk never hesitated to allow Floren to display his virtuosity; occasionally the two would even play duets.

Over the next thirty-two years, Floren became one of the most popular members of the band and the organization itself. It began with the band&#x27;s migration to California, along with concert dates on the road, and exposure to television, first on local broadcasts from the Aragon Ballroom in Santa Monica, California and later on the ABC network in 1955. During the time &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; was on television, Floren was a featured solo performer and an assistant conductor. He also took over some of the maestro&#x27;s announcing duties.

== Later years ==
In the mid-1970s, Floren formed an orchestra of his own while still employed by the Welk organization. Headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, the Myron Floren Orchestra played during the Welk show&#x27;s off-season and during holiday breaks, becoming a regional favorite. After the show went off the air in the early 1980s, Floren continued to perform on the road, as many as 200 days a year, either as a solo artist, with his orchestra, or with other members of the &quot;Welk Show&quot; cast. He is also shown playing in the music video &#x27;Can&#x27;t Cry Anymore&#x27; by the band Kansas.

Among the annual events which he headlined were the German Fest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the Norsk Høstfest in Minot, North Dakota; the Strawberry Festival in Plant City, Florida; the Wurstfest and his birthday in New Braunfels, Texas; and the PolkaFest at the Welk Resort in Branson, Missouri. He died of cancer in California on July 23, 2005, at age 85.

== Recognition ==
Floren was among the first class of inductees into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame in 1984 and inducted into the International Polka Music Hall of Fame in 1990. In 1992 at a General Assembly in Trossingen, Germany, the Confédération internationale des accordéonistes awarded Myron Floren their Merit Award in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the international accordion movement. In July 1996, the American Accordionists&#x27; Association honored Floren for his achievements.

<doc id="877692" wikidata="Q2592369" url="?curid=877692" title="Minotaur-class cruiser (1943)">
<text>The Minotaur&quot; class, also known as the Swiftsure&quot; class after the lead ship was sold to Canada and renamed, were a group of light cruisers of the British Royal Navy built during the Second World War. They were designed as a modified version of the incorporating war modifications and authorised in 1941. However, in spite of the heavy toll of cruisers in that year and the following one, the building of this new class had a relatively low priority and only three of the planned twelve were completed by end of World War II. They played no significant part in the Second World War, though &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, as flagship of the British Pacific Cruiser Squadron, was selected by Admiral Cecil Harcourt to hoist his flag for the Japanese surrender at Hong Kong.

&quot;Superb&quot; was completed to a slightly different design than the first two ships, work on another three was cancelled and the last three were eventually built to a different design as the .

==Design==
The class was originally to have consisted of twelve ships, six were laid down in 1941–1942 and the seventh unit, &quot;Hawke&quot;, in 1943. Four of the ordered cruisers were cancelled almost immediately, three in March 1942 being replaced by the first light fleet carrier order and another, probably &quot;Mars&quot;, was cancelled in November 1942. An eighth cruiser, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, started in early 1944, and then stopped and cancelled; its already constructed boilers and turbines were installed in the light fleet carriers &quot;Colossus&quot; and &quot;Perseus&quot; (ex &quot;Edgar&quot;) being constructed in the same Vickers Armstrong yard as &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had been started. It appears &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was then reordered as a &quot;Neptune&quot;-class cruiser. but by the end of World War II only &quot;Minotaur&quot;, , and were complete, whilst the others were laid up. &quot;Minotaur&quot; was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy and renamed &quot;Ontario&quot;. While the basic specifications and original armament were only a slight enlargement of the &quot;Fiji&quot; class with an extra twin 4-inch turret, the &quot;Minotaur&quot;s did represent a substantial advance towards more sophisticated weapon control and integration of command and control and Action Information Office and developments towards operation room control of fighting ships. By 1944 the seven &quot;Minotaur&quot;s under construction represented four distinct groups, which were so significantly different that they could probably be regarded as four separate classes of cruiser. &quot;Swiftsure&quot; introduced the reliable Type 274 lock-and-follow radar, which increased the accuracy of the main armament to get on target quickly. The second &quot;Superb&quot; extended this more advanced radar with the addition of Type 275 for anti-aircraft fire control, although &quot;Superb&quot;″s version lacked the flyplane or the accurate finishing in the version fitted to later s. The third group of &quot;Minotaur&quot;s, the &quot;Tiger&quot;s, were being built from quite early in their evolution with a different main battery consisting of three triple Mk 24 6-inch turrets, which were dual purpose, elevating to 60 degrees, and which automatically tracked and followed targets under Type 274/275 radar control. These guns and those for &quot;Hawke&quot;, the fourth &quot;Tiger&quot;, were nearly complete by late 1946 and were stored at Rosyth until the late 1950s as alternatives to the Mk 26 automatic twin 6-inch guns that were eventually fitted. &quot;Hawke&quot; represented a further development, surprisingly scrapped on the slip in late 1945, with its boilers and machinery complete, and its guns nearly finished.

Three of the laid-up vessels were completed in the 1960s as s. Two were given helicopter facilities and anti-aircraft missile systems to become &quot;helicopter and command cruisers&quot; during the 1970s.

==Modifications==
&quot;Swiftsure&quot; was completed with sixteen twin and six single 20 mm guns, but had all the singles and eight of the twins removed in the summer of 1945, when she received, in lieu, eight 40 mm Bofors and five single 40 mm Bofors Mk III. HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot; (ex-&quot;Minotaur&quot;) was completed with the same close-range outfit as &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, and is reported to have had an outfit of six 40 mm and six 20 mm guns at the end of the war, all in single mountings. &quot;Superb&quot; was not completed until after the end of hostilities, and had a close-range outfit consisting of eight single 40 mm Mk III, two single 2-pounders, four twin hand-operated 20 mm and two single 20 mm guns.

After a collision between &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and the destroyer in the West Indies on 16 September 1953, &quot;Swiftsure&quot; was largely rebuilt to the pattern of the reconstruction of in 1956–59. The work on &quot;Swiftsure&quot; was largely completed but it was placed in reserve rather than fitted out with the only available armament, which was its original and labour-intensive triple 6-inch guns, two twin 4-inch guns, and a pair of L/60 Bofors which would have been controlled by a six-channel MRS8 US supplied fire control system. The 1953 plan to modernize the ship with the new twin 3-inch 70 calibre guns was rejected around 1954 because &quot;Swiftsure&quot;′s beam of did not allow enough space, and the cost of a full reconstruction of &quot;Superb&quot; as a fourth &quot;Tiger&quot; with full new armament was considered too expensive. The new 70 calibre twin 3-inch mounts were experimental, and it was far from clear that they would ever be reliable enough to be effective. A more limited update of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Superb&quot; with new L/70 Bofors firing proximity fused shells was approved and then cancelled, because the time and cost of &quot;Swiftsure&quot;′s modernisation was proving too great and the necessary conversion from DC to AC power was considered too expensive on half-life ships. Options of the Type 965 radar on its new lattice mast and a data link were considered. The cost of finishing the &quot;Tiger&quot;-class cruisers (£35 million) was a major political issue, as was the new automatic guns jamming. The jamming issue was partly rectified by 1958, but only after inflicting terminal damage to the credibility of the project. The completion of &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot; was in real danger of being stopped in early 1960, and automatic gun cruisers were considered obsolete in the United States and the Soviet Union. Problems with cracking that occurred in the update of &quot;Swiftsure&quot; as a result of the collision with the destroyer &quot;Diamond&quot; slowed the refit, raised costs, and made recommissioning at the same time as &quot;Belfast&quot; impossible. Re-entering service in 1960 with only Second World War-era cruiser weapons was too expensive, but there were no suitable modern weapons to fit. About £1 million was spent on the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; &#x27;reconstruction&#x27; project by 1961, &quot;under a half&quot; of that on new construction.
In 1959-60, the Royal Navy fought hard to retain &quot;Swiftsure&quot; as a new modernization pattern of a cruiser - helicopter carrier. This design was largely implemented a decade later on its half-sisters and . This was intended to allow more space on carriers for fighters and strike aircraft.

<doc id="877698" wikidata="Q1826488" url="?curid=877698" title="General linear model">
<text>The general linear model or general multivariate regression model is a compact way of simultaneously writing several multiple linear regression models. In that sense it is not a separate statistical linear model. The various multiple linear regression models may be compactly written as
: formula_1

where Y is a matrix with series of multivariate measurements (each column being a set of measurements on one of the dependent variables), X is a matrix of observations on independent variables that might be a design matrix (each column being a set of observations on one of the independent variables), B is a matrix containing parameters that are usually to be estimated and U is a matrix containing errors (noise). The errors are usually assumed to be uncorrelated across measurements, and follow a multivariate normal distribution. If the errors do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, generalized linear models may be used to relax assumptions about Y and U.

The general linear model incorporates a number of different statistical models: ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, ordinary linear regression, &quot;t&quot;-test and &quot;F&quot;-test. The general linear model is a generalization of multiple linear regression to the case of more than one dependent variable. If Y, B, and U were column vectors, the matrix equation above would represent multiple linear regression.

Hypothesis tests with the general linear model can be made in two ways: multivariate or as several independent univariate tests. In multivariate tests the columns of Y are tested together, whereas in univariate tests the columns of Y are tested independently, i.e., as multiple univariate tests with the same design matrix.

== Comparison to multiple linear regression ==

Multiple linear regression is a generalization of simple linear regression to the case of more than one independent variable, and a special case of general linear models, restricted to one dependent variable. The basic model for multiple linear regression is

:formula_2 or more compactly formula_3

for each observation &quot;i&quot; = 1, ... , &quot;n&quot;.

In the formula above we consider &quot;n&quot; observations of one dependent variable and &quot;p&quot; independent variables. Thus, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the &quot;i&quot;th observation of the dependent variable, &quot;X&quot;&quot;ik&quot; is &quot;k&quot;th observation of the &quot;k&quot;th independent variable, &quot;j&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;p&quot;. The values &quot;β&quot;&quot;j&quot; represent parameters to be estimated, and &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the &quot;i&quot;th independent identically distributed normal error.

In the more general multivariate linear regression, there is one equation of the above form for each of &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1 dependent variables that share the same set of explanatory variables and hence are estimated simultaneously with each other:

:formula_4 or more compactly formula_5

for all observations indexed as &quot;i&quot; = 1, ... , &quot;n&quot; and for all dependent variables indexed as &quot;j = 1&quot;, &quot;...&quot; , &quot;m&quot;.

Note that, since each dependent variable has its own set of regression parameters to be fitted, from a computational point of view the general multivariate regression is simply a sequence of standard multiple linear regressions using the same explanatory variables.

== Comparison to generalized linear model ==
The general linear model and the generalized linear model (GLM) are two commonly used families of statistical methods to relate some number of continuous and/or categorical predictors to a single outcome variable.

The main difference between the two approaches is that the general linear model strictly assumes that the residuals will follow a conditionally normal distribution, while the GLM loosens this assumption and allows for a variety of other distributions from the exponential family for the residuals. The general linear model is a special case of the GLM in which the distribution of the residuals follow a conditionally normal distribution.

The distribution of the residuals largely depends on the type and distribution of the outcome variable; different types of outcome variables lead to the variety of models within the GLM family. Commonly used models in the GLM family include binary logistic regression for binary or dichotomous outcomes, Poisson regression for count outcomes, and linear regression for continuous, normally distributed outcomes. This means that GLM may be spoken of as a general family of statistical models or as specific models for specific outcome types.
== Applications ==
An application of the general linear model appears in the analysis of multiple brain scans in scientific experiments where contains data from brain scanners, contains experimental design variables and confounds. It is usually tested in a univariate way (usually referred to a &quot;mass-univariate&quot; in this setting) and is often referred to as statistical parametric mapping.

<text>The Fidelity Medallion is the oldest decoration of the United States military and was created by act of the Continental Congress in 1780. Also known as the &quot;André Capture Medal&quot;, the Fidelity Medallion was awarded to those soldiers who participated in the capture of Major John André, of the British Army, who had been the contact to Benedict Arnold and had helped organize his defection.

Historical records indicate that three soldiers, all members of the militia of New York state, were awarded the Fidelity Medallion after its first issuance: Private John Paulding, Private David Williams, and Private Isaac Van Wart.

The obverse of the medallion was inscribed &quot;; the reverse, with the motto, &quot;, which means, &quot;The love of country conquers.&quot;

The Fidelity Medallion was never again bestowed and it quickly became regarded as a commemorative decoration. For this reason, the Badge of Military Merit is generally considered the first decoration of the U.S. military, even though it was created two years after the Fidelity Medallion, in 1782.

==Disposition of the three Medallions==
All three of the original Medallions were thought to be lost. Isaac Van Wart&#x27;s example was thought to be lost at the time of his death in 1828, but was actually in the hands of a descendant in Westchester County, NY, until it was donated to the New York State Museum in 2023. John Paulding&#x27;s and David Williams&#x27; medallions were both donated to the New-York Historical Society in 1905 which displayed them in a locked, glass-topped case. In mid-1975, the two Medallions were stolen, along with the pocket watch originally belonging to Major John André. The Historical Society did not go public with the loss at the time, and none of the items have been recovered.

==Replicas==
In the two centuries since the original Fidelity Medallions were issued, replicas have occasionally been produced in metals including silver, pewter, lead and bronze and in varying degrees of historical accuracy. The American Numismatic Society has six different specimens in their collection.

An auction catalog, published for a September 2012 sale which featured a replica of the award, includes a description of the Fidelity Medallion:

 [...] Fidelity Medallion, the oldest decoration of the United States military and created by act of the Continental Congress in 1780. It is also referred to as &quot;André Capture Medal&quot; as historical records indicate that it was awarded to three soldiers from the New York Militia, David Williams, John Paulding and Isaac Van Wert, who aided in the arrest of Major John André for his role in organizing Benedict Arnold&#x27;s defection to the British Army. The medal is 55 mm × 41 mm, beautifully struck. The face of the medallion contains the inscription &quot;FIDELITY&quot; and the reverse &quot;AMOR PATRIÆ VINCIT&quot; (&quot;The love of country conquers&quot;).

At the time, the medal did not sell.

<text>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is an umbrella term for fast heart rhythms arising from the upper part of the heart. This is in contrast to the other group of fast heart rhythms – ventricular tachycardia, which start within the lower chambers of the heart. There are four main types of SVT: atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), and Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome. The symptoms of SVT include palpitations, feeling of faintness, sweating, shortness of breath, and/or chest pain.
These abnormal rhythms start from either the atria or atrioventricular node. They are generally due to one of two mechanisms: re-entry or increased automaticity. Diagnosis is typically by electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitor, or event monitor. Blood tests may be done to rule out specific underlying causes such as hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytomas, or electrolyte abnormalities.

A normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. A resting heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute is defined as a tachycardia. During an episode of SVT, the heart beats about 150 to 220 times per minute.

Specific treatment depends on the type of SVT and can include medications, medical procedures, or surgery. Vagal maneuvers, or a procedure known as catheter ablation, may be effective in certain types. For atrial fibrillation, calcium channel blockers or beta blockers may be used for rate control, and selected patients benefit from blood thinners (anticoagulants) such as warfarin or novel anticoagulants. Atrial fibrillation affects about 25 per 1000 people, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia 2.3 per 1000, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome 2 per 1000, and atrial flutter 0.8 per 1000.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms can arise suddenly and may resolve without treatment. Stress, exercise, and emotion can all result in a normal or physiological increase in heart rate, but they can precipitate SVT in rare cases. Episodes can last from a few minutes to one or two days. They sometimes persist until treated. The rapid heart rate, if fast enough, reduces the opportunity for the &quot;pump&quot; to fill between beats decreasing cardiac output and consequently blood pressure. The following symptoms are typical with a rate of 150–270 or more beats per minute:
* Pounding heart
* Rapid heart beat
* Shortness of breath
* Chest pain
* Rapid breathing
* Dizziness
* Sweating
* Loss of consciousness

Symptoms of heart arrhythmias, such as SVT, are more difficult to assess in infants and toddlers because of their limited ability to communicate. Caregivers should watch for lack of interest in feeding, shallow breathing, and lethargy. These symptoms may be subtle and may be accompanied by vomiting and/or a decrease in responsiveness.

==Pathophysiology==

The main pumping chamber, the ventricle, is protected (to a certain extent) against excessively high rates arising from the supraventricular areas by a &quot;gating mechanism&quot; at the atrioventricular node, which allows only a proportion of the fast impulses to pass through to the ventricles. An accessory &quot;bypass tract&quot; can avoid the AV node and its protection so that the fast rate may be directly transmitted to the ventricles. This situation has characteristic findings on ECG.
A congenital heart lesion, Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly, is most commonly associated with supraventricular tachycardia.

==Diagnosis==
Subtypes of SVT can often be distinguished by their electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Most have a narrow QRS complex, although, occasionally, electrical conduction abnormalities may produce a wide QRS complex that may mimic ventricular tachycardia (VT). In the clinical setting, the distinction between narrow and wide complex tachycardia (supraventricular vs. ventricular) is fundamental since they are treated differently. In addition, ventricular tachycardia can quickly degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and death and merits different consideration. In the less common situation in which a wide-complex tachycardia may be supraventricular, a number of algorithms have been devised to assist in distinguishing between them. In general, a history of structural heart disease markedly increases the likelihood that the tachycardia is ventricular in origin.
* Sinus tachycardia is physiologic when a reasonable stimulus, such as the catecholamine surge associated with fright, stress, or physical activity, provokes the tachycardia. It is identical to a normal sinus rhythm, except for its faster rate (&gt;100 beats per minute in adults). However, sinus tachycardia is considered part of the diagnoses included in SVT by most sources.
* Sinoatrial node reentrant tachycardia (SANRT) is caused by a reentry circuit localised to the SA node, resulting in a P-wave of normal shape and size (morphology) that falls before a regular, narrow QRS complex. It cannot be distinguished electrocardiographically from sinus tachycardia unless the sudden onset is observed (or recorded on a continuous monitoring device). It may sometimes be distinguished by its prompt response to vagal maneuvers.
* Ectopic (unifocal) atrial tachycardia arises from an independent focus within the atria, distinguished by a consistent P-wave of abnormal shape and/or size that falls before a narrow, regular QRS complex. It can be caused by &quot;automaticity&quot;, which means that some cardiac muscle cells, which have the primordial (&quot;primitive, inborn, inherent&quot;) ability to generate electrical impulses that are common to all cardiac muscle cells, have established themselves as a &#x27;rhythm center&#x27; with a natural rate of electrical discharge that is faster than the normal SA node. Some atrial tachycardias, rather than being a result of increased automaticity may be a result of a micro-reentrant circuit (defined by some as less than 2 cm in longest diameter to distinguish it from macro-reentrant atrial flutter). Still other atrial tachycardias may be due to triggered activity caused by after-depolarizations.
* Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is tachycardia arising from at least three ectopic foci within the atria, distinguished by P-waves of at least three different morphologies that all fall before irregular, narrow QRS complexes. This rhythm is most commonly seen in elderly people with COPD.

* Atrial fibrillation meets the definition of SVT when associated with a ventricular response greater than 100 beats per minute. It is characterized as an &quot;irregularly, irregular rhythm&quot; both in its atrial and ventricular depolarizations and is distinguished by its fibrillatory atrial waves that, at some point in their chaos, stimulate a response from the ventricles in the form of irregular, narrow QRS complexes.
* Atrial flutter, is caused by a re-entry rhythm in the atria, with a regular atrial rate often of about 300 beats per minute. On the ECG this appears as a line of &quot;sawtooth&quot; waves preceding the QRS complex. The AV node will not usually conduct 300 beats per minute so the P:QRS ratio is usually 2:1 or 4:1 pattern, (though rarely 3:1, and sometimes 1:1 where class IC antiarrhythmic drug are in use). Because the ratio of P to QRS is usually consistent, A-flutter is often regular in comparison to its irregular counterpart, atrial fibrillation. Atrial flutter is also not necessarily a tachycardia by definition unless the AV node permits a ventricular response greater than 100 beats per minute.
* AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) involves a reentry circuit forming next to, or within, the AV node. The circuit most often involves two tiny pathways one faster than the other. Because the node is immediately between the atria and ventricle, the re-entry circuit often stimulates both, appearing as a backward (retrograde) conducted P-wave buried within or occurring just &quot;after&quot; the regular, narrow QRS complexes.
* Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), also results from a reentry circuit, although one physically much larger than AVNRT. One portion of the circuit is usually the AV node, and the other, an abnormal accessory pathway (muscular connection) from the atria to the ventricle. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a relatively common abnormality with an accessory pathway, the bundle of Kent crossing the AV valvular ring.
** In orthodromic AVRT, atrial impulses are conducted down through the AV node and retrogradely re-enter the atrium via the accessory pathway. A distinguishing characteristic of orthodromic AVRT can therefore be an inverted P-wave (relative to a sinus P wave) that follows each of its regular, narrow QRS complexes, due to retrograde conduction.
** In antidromic AVRT, atrial impulses are conducted down through the accessory pathway and re-enter the atrium retrogradely via the AV node. Because the accessory pathway initiates conduction in the ventricles outside of the bundle of His, the QRS complex in antidromic AVRT is wider than usual. A delta wave is an initial slurred deflection seen in the initial part of an otherwise narrow QRS of a patient at risk for WPW and is an indicator of the presence of an accessory pathway. These beats are a fusion between the conduction down the accessory pathway and the slightly delayed but then-dominant conduction via the AV node. Once an antidromic AVRT tachycardia is initiated, it is no longer delta waves but rather a wide complex (&gt;120 ms) tachycardia that is seen.
* Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a rare tachycardia caused by increased automaticity of the AV node itself initiating frequent heartbeats. On the ECG, junctional tachycardia often presents with abnormal morphology P-waves that may fall anywhere in relation to a regular, narrow QRS complex. It is often due to drug toxicity.

===Classification===
The following types of supraventricular tachycardias are more precisely classified by their specific site of origin. While each belongs to the broad classification of SVT, the specific term/diagnosis is preferred when possible:

Sinoatrial origin:
* Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SNRT)
Atrial origin:
* Ectopic (unifocal) atrial tachycardia (EAT)
* Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response
:(Without rapid ventricular response, fibrillation and flutter are usually not classified as SVT)

Atrioventricular origin:
* AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or junctional reciprocating tachycardia (JRT)
* AV reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) – visible or concealed (including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)
** Permanent (or persistent) junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT), a form of SVT that involves a slow retrograde conduction over accessory pathway – occurs predominantly in infants and children but can occasionally occur in adults
* Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET)

==Prevention==
Once an acute arrhythmia has been terminated, ongoing treatment may be indicated to prevent recurrence. However, those that have an isolated episode, or infrequent and minimally symptomatic episodes, usually do not warrant treatment other than observation and explanation.

In general, patients with more frequent or disabling symptoms warrant some form of prevention. A variety of drugs including simple AV nodal blocking agents such as beta blockers and verapamil, as well as antiarrhythmic drugs may be used, usually with good effect, although the adverse effects of these therapies need to be weighed against potential benefits.

Radiofrequency ablation has revolutionized the treatment of tachycardia caused by a re-entrant pathway. This is a low-risk procedure that uses a catheter inside the heart to deliver radiofrequency energy to locate and destroy the abnormal electrical pathways. Ablation has been shown to be highly effective: around 90% in the case of AVNRT. Similar high rates of success are achieved with AVRT and typical atrial flutter.

Cryoablation is a newer treatment involving the AV node directly. SVT involving the AV node is often a contraindication to using radiofrequency ablation due to the small (1%) incidence of injuring the AV node, then requiring a permanent pacemaker. Cryoablation uses a catheter supercooled by nitrous oxide gas freezing the tissue to −10 °C (+14.0 °F). This provides the same result as radiofrequency ablation but does not carry the same risk. If it is found that the wrong tissue is being frozen, the freezing process can be quickly stopped with the tissue returning to normal temperature and function in a short time. If after freezing the tissue to −10 °C the desired result is obtained, the tissue can be further cooled to a temperature of −73 °C (-99.4 °F) and it will be permanently ablated.

This therapy has further improved the treatment options for AVNRT (and other SVTs with pathways close to the AV node), widening the application of curative ablation to young patients with relatively mild but still troublesome symptoms who might not have accepted the risk of requiring a pacemaker.

==Treatment==
Most SVTs are unpleasant rather than life-threatening, although very fast heart rates can be problematic for those with underlying ischemic heart disease, or the elderly. Episodes can be treated when they occur by Valsalva maneuver, adenosine injection or taking a AV node blocking agent as pill-in-pocket, but regular medication may also be used to prevent or reduce recurrence. While some treatment modalities can be applied to all SVTs, there are specific therapies available to treat some sub-types. Effective treatment consequently requires knowledge of how and where the arrhythmia is initiated and its mode of spread.

Lifestyle changes, medication and heart procedures may be needed to control or eliminate the rapid heartbeats and related symptoms.

SVTs can be categorised by whether the AV node is involved in maintaining the rhythm. If it is, manoeuvres slowing conduction through the AV node will terminate it. If it is not, AV nodal blocking maneuvers will not terminate it, but resulting temporary suppression of the AV node is still useful to unmask the underlying abnormal rhythm.

Acute attacks of supraventricular tachycardia are treated with Esmolol (i.v.).

<text>Doner kebab or döner kebab is a dish of Turkish origin made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, Canadian donair, and Mexican al pastor are derived from this. 

The modern sandwich variant of doner kebab originated and was popularized in 1970s West Berlin by Turkish immigrants. This was recognized by the Berlin-based Association of Turkish Döner Manufacturers in Europe in 2011.

The sliced meat of a doner kebab may be served on a plate with various accompaniments, stuffed into a pita or other type of bread as a sandwich, or wrapped in a thin flatbread such as lavash or filo, known as a &quot;dürüm&quot; (literally meaning &quot;roll&quot; or &quot;wrap&quot; in Turkish). Kadir Nurman in the early 1970s introduced the sandwich or wrap form, which has become popular around the world as a fast food dish sold by kebab shops, and is often called simply a &quot;kebab&quot;. The sandwich generally contains salad or vegetables, which may include tomato; lettuce; cabbage; onion with sumac; fresh or pickled cucumber or chili; and various types of sauces.

== History ==

In the Ottoman Empire, at least as far back as the 17th century, stacks of seasoned sliced meat were cooked on a horizontal rotisserie, similar to the cağ kebab. The vertical rotisserie was introduced no later than the mid-19th century. The town of Bursa, in modern-day Turkey, is often considered the birthplace of the vertically roasted doner kebab. According to Yavuz İskenderoğlu, his grandfather İskender Efendi as a child in 1850s Bursa had the idea of roasting the lamb at his father&#x27;s restaurant vertically rather than horizontally; it was a success, and some years later became known as &quot;doner kebap&quot;. However, he may have been preceded by Hamdi Usta from Kastamonu around 1830.

A version popular in the Arab world became known as &quot;shawarma&quot;. By at least the 1930s it had been brought overseas, and was sold in restaurants in Mexico by Lebanese immigrants. Doner kebab likely arrived in Greece in the 1920s with the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, later transforming into &quot;gyros&quot;.

It was not until a century after its invention that doner kebab was introduced and popularized in Istanbul, most famously by Beyti Güler. His restaurant, first opened in 1945, was soon discovered by journalists and began serving doner and other kebab dishes to kings, prime ministers, film stars and celebrities. It has been sold in sandwich form in Istanbul since at least the mid-1960s.

The doner kebab and its derivatives served in a sandwich form as &quot;fast food&quot; came to worldwide prominence in the mid- to late 20th century. The first doner kebab shop in London opened in 1966 and such shops were a familiar sight in provincial cities by the late 1970s. Gyros was already popular in Greece and New York City in 1971. A Greek-Canadian variation, the &quot;donair&quot;, was introduced in 1972, eventually becoming the official food of Halifax, and spreading across the country. By the 1960s, the &quot;taco al pastor&quot; in Mexico had evolved from the shawarma.

In Germany, the doner kebab was popularized by Turkish guest workers in Berlin in the early 1970s. The dish developed there from its original form into a distinctive style of sandwich with abundant salad, vegetables, and sauces, sold in large portions at affordable prices. It would soon become one of the top-selling fast food and street food dishes in Germany and much of Europe, and popular around the world.

== Etymology ==
In the English name &quot;&quot;, the word &quot;doner&quot; is borrowed from the Turkish , with the Turkish letter &quot;ö&quot; usually anglicized as &quot;o&quot;, though &quot;döner kebab&quot; is an alternative spelling in English. The word &quot;&quot; is used, which comes to English from the (&quot;kabāb&quot;), partly through Urdu, Persian and Turkish; it may refer to a number of different kebab dishes made with roasted or grilled meat. Although &quot;kebab&quot; has been used in English since the late 17th century, &quot;doner/döner kebab&quot; is known only from the mid-20th century or later. The Turkish word &#x27; comes from &quot;dönmek&quot; (&quot;to turn&quot; or &quot;to rotate&quot;), so the Turkish name literally means &quot;rotating roast&quot;. In German, it is spelled &quot;Döner Kebab&quot;; the sandwich is often called &quot;ein Döner&quot;. Particularly in British English, a doner kebab sandwich may be referred to simply as &quot;a kebab&quot;. A Canadian variation is &quot;donair&quot;. In Greek, it was originally called &quot;döner&quot; () but later came to be known as &quot;gyros&quot;, from (&quot;turn&quot;), a calque of the Turkish name. The Arabic name (&quot;shāwarmā&quot;) derives from another Turkish word, &#x27;, also meaning &quot;turning&quot;. Persians refer to it as &quot;kebab torki&quot;.

== Doner in Turkey ==
There are many variations of &quot;doner&quot; in Turkey:
* &quot;Porsiyon&quot; (&quot;portion&quot;, doner on a slightly heated plate, sometimes with a few grilled peppers or broiled tomatoes on the side)
* &quot;Pilavüstü&quot; (&quot;over rice&quot;, doner served on a base of pilaf rice)
* &quot;İskender&quot; (specialty of Bursa, served in an oblong plate, atop a base of &quot;pide&quot; (thin flatbread similar to pita), with a dash of pepper or tomato sauce and boiling fresh butter). &quot;Kebapçı İskender&quot; is trademarked by Yavuz İskenderoğlu, whose family still runs the restaurant in Bursa.
* &quot;Dürüm&quot;, wrapped in a thin lavaş that is sometimes also grilled after being rolled, to make it crispier. It has two main variants in mainland Turkey:
** &quot;Soslu dürüm or SSK (sos, soğan, kaşar; in English: sauce, onion, cheese)&quot; (specialty of Ankara, contains İskender kebap sauce, making it juicier)
** &quot;Kaşarlı dürüm döner&quot; (speciality of Istanbul, grated kaşar cheese is put in the wrap which is then toasted to melt the cheese and crisp up the lavaş)
* &quot;Tombik&quot; or &quot;gobit&quot; (literally &quot;the chubby&quot;, doner in a bun-shaped pita, with crispy crust and soft inside and generally less meat than a dürüm)
* &quot;Ekmekarası&quot; (&quot;between bread&quot;, generally the most filling version, consisting of a whole (or a half) regular Turkish bread filled with doner)

== Regional variations ==

=== Caucasus, Middle East and Asia ===

==== Azerbaijan ====
In Azerbaijan, doner kebab (), served similarly to the European style of sandwich wrapped in &#x27; (flatbread) or in &#x27; (bread, including tandoor bread), is one of the most widespread fast foods. It is usually made with &#x27; (meat, essentially lamb or mutton), but sometimes &#x27; (chicken).

==== Japan ====

In Japan, doner kebabs are now common, especially in Tokyo. They are predominantly made of chicken but occasionally beef, and called simply &quot;kebab&quot;. The toppings include shredded lettuce or cabbage, sliced tomato, and usually a choice of sauces such as Thousand Island, spicy, and garlic.

==== Vietnam ====

Doner kebab is increasingly becoming popular in Vietnam, mostly because of Vietnamese who used to live in Germany and introduced it to their homeland. Throughout Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City many doner kebab stalls can be found. Bánh mỳ Döner Kebab, the Vietnamese version of the doner kebab, has some fundamental differences with the original doner kebab. First of all, pork is used instead of beef and lamb. Second, the meat is topped with sour vegetables and chili sauce.

=== Europe ===

==== Austria ====

Doner kebab shops can be found in all cities across Austria. Kebabs (often referred to as &quot;Döner&quot;) outsell burgers or the traditional Würstel (sausage).

==== Belgium ====
In Belgium, the first doner kebabs were already served in the 1970s, brought by immigrants to the country. In the mining region, mainly beef or variants with pieces of chicken was used for the doner kebab. Doner kebabs with mutton and lamb were more likely to be found in other regions of Belgium.

==== Finland ====

In Finland, doner kebabs gained popularity after the 90s, when Turkish and other Middle-Eastern immigrants started to arrive in the country in considerable numbers, opening restaurants and importing their traditional dishes. Kebabs are generally seen as fast food, often served by late-night pizzerias.

==== France ====
Turkish immigrants also brought doner kebab to France, where it became especially popular with the country&#x27;s large North African population, in the 1980s. A typical &quot;kebab&quot; consists of bread stuffed with doner meat shavings, lettuce, sliced tomato and onions, with a choice of sauce including sauce blanche, a mayonnaise-yogurt sauce. Kebabs are usually served with french fries, often stuffed into the bread itself. In Paris, this variation is called &quot;sandwich grec&quot; (&quot;Greek sandwich&quot;). Doner kebab is the third most popular fast food in France, next to hamburgers and pizza, with more than 10,000 kebab shops selling about 300 million a year.

==== Germany ====

In Germany, the earliest claim to the introduction of Turkish doner kebab dates to 1969, when Bursa native Nevzat Salim and his father started to sell Iskender Kebap in Reutlingen. However, the Association of Turkish Döner Producers in Europe (ATDID) connects the wide popularization of the dish to the stand of Turkish guest worker Kadir Nurman at West Berlin&#x27;s Zoo Station in 1972, which helped establish the doner kebab sandwich as a fast food option. Although the claims of multiple persons to have &quot;invented&quot; the doner may be hard to prove, the further development of modern doner sandwich is connected to the city of Berlin.

The doner kebap as it was first served in Berlin contained only meat, onions and a bit of salad. Over time, it developed into a dish with abundant salad, vegetables, and a selection of sauces to choose from. Even orders placed in the Turkish language in Berlin will ask for the hot sauce using the German word &quot;scharf&quot;, flagging the hybrid nature of the Berlin style of doner kebap. This variation served with pita bread has influenced the style of doner kebap in Germany and in other nations. A 2007 survey showed that many people consider the doner kebab to be the most characteristic food of Berlin.

Annual sales of doner kebabs in Germany amounted to €2.5 billion in 2010. Beef or veal, and chicken, are widely used instead of the more expensive lamb. Turkey &quot;(Truthahn)&quot; and vegetarian versions have become increasingly popular.

Tarkan Taşyumruk, president of the Association of Turkish Döner Producers in Europe (ATDID), provided information in 2010 that, every day, more than 400 tonnes of doner kebab meat is produced in Germany by around 350 firms. At the same ATDID fair, Taşyumruk stated: &quot;Annual sales in Germany amount to €2.5 billion. That shows we are one of the biggest fast-foods in Germany.&quot; In many cities throughout Germany, doner kebabs are at least as popular as hamburgers or sausages, especially with young people.

In 2011 there were over 16,000 establishments selling doner kebabs in Germany, with yearly sales of €3.5 billion.

==== Netherlands ====
&quot;Kapsalon&quot; is a Dutch food item consisting of French fries topped with doner or shawarma meat, garlic sauce, and a layer of gouda cheese, baked or broiled until melted, and then subsequently covered with a layer of dressed salad greens and more sauce. The dish is usually served as fast food in a disposable metal tray. The term &quot;kapsalon&quot; means &quot;hairdressing salon&quot; or &quot;barbershop&quot; in Dutch, alluding to hairdresser Nathaniel Gomes who originated the dish when he requested his local kebab shop in Rotterdam to prepare it for him.

==== United Kingdom ====
Introduced by Turkish immigrants, the doner kebab with salad and sauce is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom, especially after a night out. The meat is sometimes sold on its own, but more commonly with chips (fries), in naan bread or in pita bread. German Doner Kebab is a Glasgow-based chain operating 100 restaurants in the UK, which specialises in the dish.

=== Americas ===

==== Canada ====
A variation known as donair was introduced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the early 1970s. There are competing claims about the origin, but according to Halifax resident Leo Gamoulakos, his father, Greek immigrant Peter Gamoulakos, started selling Greek-style gyros at Velos Pizza in the Halifax suburb of Bedford. It did not catch on with the public, so in 1972 he modified the customary pork and lamb recipe by using spiced ground beef, Lebanese flatbread, and inventing the distinctive sweet &quot;donair sauce&quot; made with condensed milk, vinegar, sugar, and garlic. He called it by the &quot;doner&quot; name rather than &quot;gyros&quot;, but it came to be pronounced, and spelled, as &quot;donair&quot;. In 1973 Gamoulakos opened the first King of Donair restaurant on Quinpool Road in Halifax. In 2015, Halifax named donair the city&#x27;s official food. Historically found only in Atlantic Canada, the dish&#x27;s popularity has expanded to other parts of Canada in various forms.

==== Mexico ====
Al pastor is a variation of doner kebab via Lebanese shawarma. Literally meaning &quot;in the style of the shepherd&quot;, it references the lamb often used in shawarma, though it is normally made with pork.

==== United States ====

Doner kebab is best known in the United States in its Greek variation, now known as &quot;gyros&quot;. Numerous people have made competing claims to have introduced the dish sometime in the 1960s, and its mass production in the 1970s. Originally known in Greece as (doner), by 1970 in the United States the newly coined name &quot;gyros&quot; was commonly in use, though it was still known in some Greek restaurants by both names into the 1970s. It was also available, possibly later, in some Turkish restaurants. In recent years a number of restaurants and food trucks specializing in doner kebab have opened in various parts of the country; a substantial percentage are owned by German immigrants.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====

With a multicultural population, the doner kebab in Australia competes with the Greek gyros and the Lebanese shawarma. Kebab sellers are subject to strict government food safety regulations.

A halal snack pack is a dish that originated in Australia. It consists of halal-certified doner kebab meat, chips (french fries), and sauces such as chili, garlic and barbecue. It is traditionally served in a styrofoam container, and has been described as a staple dish of takeaway kebab shops in Australia. The name of the dish was selected by the Macquarie Dictionary as the &quot;People&#x27;s choice Word of the Year&quot; for 2016.

== Health concerns ==
Health concerns regarding doner kebab, including the hygiene involved in overnight storage and re-heating of partially cooked meat, its quality, as well as high salt, fat, and calorie levels, have been reported in the media. Some investigations have found poor-quality ingredients in doner kebab meat, or meat types other than what was advertised. Food safety regulations in most developed countries address the dangers of bacteria in undercooked meat of all kinds sold to the public. Some have guidelines specific to doner kebab handling and preparation. Following several outbreaks of &quot;E. coli&quot; food poisoning, the Canadian government in 2008 introduced a number of recommendations, including that the meat should be cooked a second time after being sliced from the rotisserie. In Germany, any doner kebab meat placed onto the rotisserie must be sold the same day. It is a violation of German health regulations to freeze partially cooked meat for sale at a later date.

<text>Kari Samantha Wuhrer (born April 28, 1967) is an American former actress, model, and singer. She is known for her time as hostess of the MTV game show &quot;Remote Control&quot; (1988–1989), her portrayals of Abigail on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1991–1992), and Maggie Beckett on the Fox/Syfy series &quot;Sliders&quot; (1997–2000). Wuhrer has appeared in horror films such as &quot;Anaconda&quot; (1997), &quot;Eight Legged Freaks&quot; (2002), &quot;King of the Ants&quot; (2003), &quot;The Hitcher II: I&#x27;ve Been Waiting&quot; (2003), &quot;&quot; (2005), two entries in the &quot;Prophecy&quot; series (both 2005), and &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot; (2014). She portrayed Agent Tanya in cutscenes of Westwood Studios&#x27; real-time strategy video game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot; and its subsequent expansion pack, &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. She also provided the voice of Maria Hill for Disney XD&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; (2010–2012).

==Early life==
Wuhrer was born in Brookfield, Connecticut, the daughter of Karin (née Noble), a payroll accountant, and German-American Andrew Wuhrer, a police officer and car salesman. She has three siblings. As a teenager, she sang in nightclubs, sneaking out of the family home to perform. She studied acting from the age of 13 at the Wooster School, then studied drama at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, Marymount Manhattan College, Columbia University, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art with famed teacher Uta Hagen.

==Career==
Wuhrer&#x27;s first television break was MTV&#x27;s &quot;Remote Control&quot; (1987). She was a regular cast member of the television series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; from 1991 to 1992. She also worked as a VJ on MTV during the same period. In 1993, she was a regular in the TV series &quot;Class of &#x27;96&quot;, where she played college student Robin Farr. From 1994 to 1995, she starred as Ariel Hunter in the long-running primetime soap opera &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

During this period, she appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot; (1990) and starred in &quot;Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time&quot; (1991). In 1995, she also had a supporting role in the John Singleton film &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, followed by &quot;Thinner&quot; (1996), &quot;Anaconda&quot; (1997), and &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot; (1998).
Wuhrer returned to television in 1997 on the series &quot;Sliders&quot; as Maggie Beckett, joining the cast as a regular and staying until the series ended in 2000. Wuhrer also guest-starred in the TV series &quot;Leverage&quot;.

Wuhrer signed a record deal with Rick Rubin, and her only album, &quot;Shiny&quot;, was released in 1999 by Del-Fi Records. In addition to her singing, she wrote most of the songs on the album and played both the guitar and the flute on several tracks. Wuhrer made a disastrous appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; to promote the album.

Her later mainstream film roles include &quot;Berserker&quot; (2001) and &quot;Eight Legged Freaks&quot; (2002). She was an executive producer of the direct-to-video film &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, with Stephen Baldwin, of which Wuhrer said: &quot;The pace of making this movie, it was extreme. It was the longest day imaginable...&quot;.

Wuhrer is also known by gamers for her role as Agent Tanya in cutscenes of Westwood Studios&#x27; real-time strategy video game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot; and its subsequent expansion pack, &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

Wuhrer was later voted number 76 on the &quot;FHM&quot; 100 Sexiest Women of 2000, number 73 in the &quot;FHM&quot; 100 Sexiest Women in the World of 2001, and number 36 in &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Sexiest Women Countdown of 1999. She posed seminude in &quot;Playboy&quot; in August 2000 as their &quot;Babe of the Month&quot; and earlier considered multiple offers to appear fully nude throughout 1998. She was also No. 64 on &quot;Celebrity Skin&#x27;s&quot; 100 Sexiest Stars of All Time and No. 4 in the &quot;Celebrity Nudity Database&#x27;s&quot; Most Popular Actresses of 1999.

Her breast implants encapsulated during the filming of &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, so she had them removed in 2002.

From February 3, 2005, through November 2005, Wuhrer joined the cast of the daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; as FBI Agent Reese Marshall, the former love interest of mobster Sonny Corinthos and former best friend/rival of Carly Corinthos. Wuhrer&#x27;s character died after suffering injuries in a train wreck. In January 2006, Wuhrer announced that she was suing &quot;General Hospital&quot;, claiming that she was fired because of her pregnancy.

==Personal life==
Wuhrer married to Daniel Salin in 1995. This union ended in divorce in 1999. 

Wuhrer married James Scura in 2003. The couple have three children: a son born in January 2004, a daughter born in March 2006 and another daughter born in September 2008.

<doc id="877742" wikidata="Q2778722" url="?curid=877742" title="Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine">
<text>The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Gold Mine (also known by similar names) is, according to legend, a rich gold mine hidden in the Southwestern United States. The location is generally believed to be in the Superstition Mountains, near Apache Junction, east of Phoenix, Arizona. There have been many stories about how to find the mine, and each year people search for the mine. Some have died on the search.

The mine is named after German immigrant Jacob Waltz (&quot;c.&quot; 1810–1891), who purportedly discovered it in the 19th century and kept its location a secret. &quot;Dutchman&quot; was a common American term for a German (&quot;Dutch&quot; being the English cognate to the German demonym &quot;Deutsch&quot;, and not a reference to the Dutch people).

The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s is perhaps the most famous lost mine in American history. Arizona place-name expert Byrd Granger wrote, as of 1977, the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s story had been printed or cited at least six times more often than two other fairly well-known tales, the story of Captain Kidd&#x27;s lost treasure, and the story of the Lost Pegleg mine in California. People have been seeking the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine since at least 1892, while according to one estimate, 9,000 people annually made some effort to locate the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine. Former Arizona Attorney General Robert K. Corbin is among those who have looked for the mine.

== Other Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mines ==
Robert Blair wrote &quot;[t]here have been at least four legendary Lost Dutchman&#x27;s gold mines in the American West, including the famed Superstition mine of Jacob Waltz&quot;. One Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine is said to be in Colorado, another in California; two are said to be located in Arizona. Tales of these other Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mines can be traced to at least the 1870s. The earliest Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine in Arizona was said to have been near Wickenburg, about north-west of the Superstition Mountains: a &quot;Dutchman&quot; was allegedly discovered dead in the desert near Wickenburg in the 1870s alongside saddlebags filled with gold. Blair suggested that &quot;fragments of this legend have perhaps become attached to the mythical mine of Jacob Waltz&quot;.

== Stories about the mine ==
Granger wrote that &quot;fact and fiction blend in the tales&quot;, but that there are three main elements to the story:

: &quot;They are, first, tales of the lost Apache gold or Dr. Thorne&#x27;s mine; second, tales about the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s; and, third, stories of the soldiers&#x27; lost gold vein ... [t]he most complete version of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s story incorporates all three legends&quot;. Blair argued that there are kernels of truth at the heart of each of these three main stories, though the popular story is often badly garbled from the actual account. Other theories have materialized that speculate the mine is buried at the bottom of Apache or Roosevelt Lake.

In 1977, Granger identified 62 variants of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s story – some of the variations are minor, but others are substantial, casting the story in a very different light from the other versions.

=== Lost Apache gold or Dr. Thorne&#x27;s story ===
In this story (actually two interconnected stories), members of the Apache tribe are said to have a very rich gold mine located in the Superstition Mountains. Famed Apache Geronimo is sometimes mentioned in relation to this story. In most variants of the story, the family of a man called Miguel Peralta discovered the mine and began mining the gold there, only to be attacked or massacred by Apaches in about 1850 in the supposed Peralta massacre. Years later, a man called Dr. Thorne treats an ailing or wounded Apache (often alleged to be a chieftain) and is rewarded with a trip to a rich gold mine. He is blindfolded and taken there by a circuitous route, and is allowed to take as much gold ore as he can carry before again being escorted blindfolded from the site by the Apaches. Thorne is said to be either unwilling or unable to relocate the mine.

==== The truth about the Peralta Mine ====
Most likely because Pedro de Peralta had been the Spanish Governor of New Mexico (in the 1600s) his family name of &quot;Peralta&quot; was the inspiration for a number of legends in the American Southwest. James Reavis tried to assert that the Peralta family had a Spanish land grant and a barony granted by the King of Spain, which included a huge swath of Arizona and New Mexico, including the Superstition Mountains. The Peralta Massacre is a legend that Apaches supposedly ambushed a mining expedition the Peralta family sent into the mountains. Some carved stones in the area are referred to as &quot;Peralta Stones&quot; and Spanish text and crude maps on them are considered by some to be clues to the location of a Peralta family gold mine in the Superstition Mountains, although others believe the stones to be modern fakes. A lack of historical records leaves uncertainty as to whether a Peralta family ever had possession of land, or mines, in or near the Superstition Mountains.

Blair insisted that the Peralta portion of the story is unreliable, writing: &quot;The operation of a gold mine in the Superstitions by a Peralta family is a contrivance of 20th century writers&quot;. A man named Miguel Peralta and his family did operate a successful mine in the 1860s – but near Valencia, California, not in Arizona. The mine was quite profitable, earning about $35,000 in less than one year; Blair described this as &quot;an unusually good return&quot; for such a small gold mine to earn in such a relatively brief period. As of 1975, ruins of the Peralta mine were standing.

However, the Peralta Mine eventually became unprofitable and after the money was gone Miguel Peralta turned to fraud. Dr. George M. Willing Jr. paid Peralta $20,000 for the mining rights for an enormous swath of land – about in southern Arizona and New Mexico – based on a deed originally granted by the Spanish Empire in the 18th century. Trouble came after Willing learned that the deed was entirely bogus. Despite his efforts, Willing was never able to recover the money he gave to Peralta. This land grant was the basis of the James Reavis Arizona land swindle (Reavis became Willing&#x27;s partner and continued to try to prove the authenticity of the land grant for years after Willing&#x27;s death).

Blair argued that this Peralta story (well known to Arizona residents) was eventually incorporated in the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s story, in a severely distorted version, following the renewed interest in the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine in the 1930s.

Since James Reavis, &quot;the Baron of Arizona&quot;, was convicted of fraud when the Peralta family genealogy and other documents to support the land grant (and a barony associated with that land) were determined to be forgeries it also raises questions about the original purchase of the land grant by Dr. George M. Willing Jr. (the transaction had supposedly occurred at a primitive campsite to the southeast of Prescott without the benefit of the typical documentation; instead of a notarized deed, the conveyance was recorded on a piece of greasy camp paper bearing signature of several witnesses). Willing died in 1874 before there had been a thorough investigation of the documents or opportunity to cross examine him on the stand as was later done with Reavis.

==== The truth about Dr. Thorne ====
Another detail which casts doubt on the story is the fact that, according to Blair, there was never any Dr. Thorne in the employ of the Army or indeed of the Federal Government in the 1860s. According to Blair, the origin of this story can be traced to a doctor named Thorne who was in private practice in New Mexico in the 1860s. Thorne claimed that he was taken captive by Navajos in 1854, and that during his captivity he had discovered a rich gold vein. Thorne related his claims to three U.S. soldiers in about 1858. The three soldiers set out to find the gold, but without success. Over the decades, this tale was gradually absorbed into the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s story.

=== The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s story ===
This tale involves two German men, Jacob Waltz and Jacob Weiser. However, Blair argued that there is a strong likelihood that there never was a second man named Weiser, but rather that a single person named Waltz was, over the years, turned into two men as the legend of the Dutchman&#x27;s mine evolved. Blair contended that this story can be divided into &quot;hawk&quot; and &quot;dove&quot; versions, depending on whether the German(s) are said to behave violently or peacefully. In most versions of the tale, Jacob Waltz locates a rich gold mine in the Superstition Mountains (in many versions of the story, they rescue or help a member of the Peralta family and are rewarded by being told the location of the mine). Waltz is attacked and wounded by marauding Apaches, but survives at least long enough to tell a man called Dr. Walker about the mine. Waltz is also said to make a deathbed confession to Julia Thomas, and draws or describes a crude map to the gold mine.

John D. Wilburn in his book &quot;Dutchman&#x27;s Lost Ledge of Gold&quot; (1990), wrote that the Bulldog Gold Mine near Goldfield, Arizona, fits very well the description Jacob Waltz gave as the location of his &#x27;lost mine&#x27;. Furthermore, Wilburn stated that geology indicates that there is no gold in the Superstition Mountains, which are igneous in origin. (However, in some versions, the &#x27;mine&#x27; is actually a cache put there by the Peraltas.)

=== Stories of the soldiers&#x27; lost gold vein ===
In yet another version of the tale, two (or more) U.S. Army soldiers are said to have discovered a vein of almost pure gold in or near the Superstition Mountains. The soldiers are alleged to have presented some of the gold, but to have been killed or to have vanished soon after.

This account is usually dated to about 1870. According to Blair, the story may have its roots in the efforts of three U.S. soldiers to locate gold in an area of New Mexico, based on an allegedly true story related to them by Dr. Thorne of New Mexico; see above.

== The historical Jacob Waltz ==

Blair cited evidence of the historical Jacob Waltz and suggested that additional evidence supports the core elements of the story – that Waltz claimed to have discovered (or at least heard the story of) a rich gold vein or cache. But Blair suggested that this core story was distorted in subsequent retellings, comparing the many variants of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s story to the game of Chinese whispers, where the original account is distorted in multiple retellings of the tale.

There was indeed a Jacob Waltz who emigrated to the U.S. from Germany. The earliest documentation of him in the U.S. is an 1848 affidavit in which Waltz declared himself to be &quot;about 38 years old&quot;. A man called Jacob &quot;Walz&quot; was born in September 1810 in Württemberg. Blair suggested that this Waltz could be the same Waltz who later came to be regarded as the legendary Dutchman, and that he Americanized the spelling of his family name. Note that tombstone pictured shows birth year as 1808.

Waltz relocated to Arizona in the 1860s, and stayed in the territory for most of the rest of his life. He pursued mining and prospecting, but seems to have had little luck with either. An alternate view which better fits the lost mine legend is that he periodically appeared with large amounts of gold, &quot;The Sterling Legend&quot; by Estee Conatser reports that a Jacob Walzer sold $250,000 in gold to the U.S. Mint during the 1880s and had $1500 when he died in 1891. In 1870, Waltz had a homestead of about near Phoenix where he operated a farm. There is a theory that although Waltz never worked at the Henry Wickenburg&#x27;s Vulture mine, (which was notorious for being poorly-managed) he could indeed have been a &quot;fence&quot; for those who did work at the Vulture.

There was a catastrophic flood in Phoenix in 1891, and Waltz&#x27;s farm was one of many that was devastated. Afterwards, Waltz fell ill (he was rumored to have contracted pneumonia during the flooding). He died on October 25, 1891, after having been nursed by an acquaintance named Julia Thomas (she was usually described as a quadroon). Waltz was buried in Phoenix at what is now called the Pioneer and Military Memorial Park.

Blair had little doubt that Waltz related to Thomas the location of an alleged gold mine. As early as September 1, 1892, The &quot;Arizona Enterprise&quot; was reporting on the efforts of Thomas and several others to locate the lost mine whose location was told to her by Waltz. After this was unsuccessful, Thomas and her partners were reported to be selling maps to the mine for $7 each.

== The death of Adolph Ruth ==
Were it not for the death of amateur explorer and treasure hunter Adolph Ruth, the story of the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine would probably have been little more than a footnote in Arizona history as one of hundreds of &quot;lost mines&quot; rumored to be in the American West. Ruth disappeared while searching for the mine in the summer of 1931. His skull – with two holes in it identified as bullet holes – was recovered about six months after he vanished, and the story made national news, thus sparking widespread interest in the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine.

In a story that echoes some of the earlier tales, Ruth&#x27;s son Erwin C. Ruth was said to have learned of the Peralta mine from a man called Pedro Gonzales (or Gonzalez). According to the story, in about 1912 Erwin C. Ruth gave some legal aid to Gonzales, saving him from almost certain imprisonment. In gratitude, Gonzales told Erwin about the Peralta mine in the Superstition Mountains, and gave him some antique maps of the site (Gonzales claimed to be descended from the Peralta family on his mother&#x27;s side). Erwin passed the information to his father Adolph, who had a long-standing interest in lost mines and amateur exploration. The elder Ruth had fallen and badly broken several bones while seeking the lost Pegleg mine in California. He had metal pins in his leg, and used a cane to help him walk.

In June 1931, Ruth set out to locate the lost Peralta mine. After traveling to the region, Ruth stayed several days at the ranch of Tex Barkely to outfit his expedition. Barkely repeatedly urged Ruth to abandon his search for the mine, because the terrain of the Superstition Mountains was treacherous even for experienced outdoorsmen, let alone for the 66-year-old Ruth in the heat of the Arizona summer.

However, Ruth ignored Barkely&#x27;s advice, and set out for a two-week stint in the mountains. Ruth did not return as scheduled, and no trace of him could be found after a brief search. In December, 1931, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; reported on the recent discovery of a human skull in the Superstition Mountains. To determine if the skull was Ruth&#x27;s, it was examined by Dr. Aleš Hrdlička, a well-respected anthropologist who was given several photos of Ruth, along with Ruth&#x27;s dental records. As Curt Gentry wrote, &quot;Dr. Hrdlicka positively identified the skull as that of Adolph Ruth. He further stated, after examining the two holes [in the skull], that it appeared that a shotgun or high-powered rifle had been fired through the head at almost point-blank range, making the small hole when the bullet entered and the large hole when it exited&quot;.

In January 1932, human remains were discovered about three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) from where the skull had been found. Though the remains had been scattered by scavengers, they were undoubtedly Ruth&#x27;s. Many of Ruth&#x27;s personal effects were found at the scene, including a pistol (not missing any shells) and the metal pins used to mend his broken bones. But the map to the Peralta mine was said to be missing.

Tantalizingly, Ruth&#x27;s checkbook was also recovered, and proved to contain a note written by Ruth wherein he claimed to have discovered the mine and gave detailed directions. Ruth ended his note with the phrase &quot;Veni, vidi, vici.&quot;

Authorities in Arizona did not convene a criminal inquest regarding Ruth&#x27;s death. They argued that Ruth had probably succumbed to thirst or heart disease (though, as Gentry wrote, &quot;[o]ne official went so far as to suggest that [Adolph Ruth] might have committed suicide ... While this theory did not ignore the two holes in the skull, it did fail to explain how Ruth had managed to remove and bury the empty shell, then reload his gun, after shooting himself through the head&quot;.) Blair noted that the conclusion of the Arizona authorities was rejected by many, including Ruth&#x27;s family, and &quot;those who held onto the more romantic murdered-for-the-map story&quot;.

Blair wrote that &quot;the national wire services picked up the story [of Ruth&#x27;s death] and ran it for more than it was worth&quot;, possibly seeing the mysterious story as a welcome reprieve from the bleak news that was otherwise typical of the Great Depression.

== Other searches for the mine ==
Throughout the 20th century, various expeditions and individuals continued to search the Superstitions for the Lost Dutchman Mine. One of the most professional and serious-minded efforts was led by Oklahoma City private detective Glen Magill, who organized multiple expeditions in the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s, and claimed on at least two occasions to have identified the location of the mine, later to concede he was either mistaken or the locations were &quot;played out,&quot; or bereft of gold. Magill&#x27;s adventures were chronicled in the book &quot;The Killer Mountains&quot;, by Curt Gentry.

One fact against the existence of &quot;Lost Dutchman Mine&quot; is that Waltz was a &quot;placer miner&quot;; while the gold pieces he had were in quartz, the Superstition Mountains are in fact volcanic. Lastly, the alleged mine directions Ruth had were from an 1895 newspaper account.

== Other deaths and disappearances ==
Since Ruth&#x27;s death, there have been several other deaths or disappearances in the Superstition Mountains. Some searchers for the mine have disappeared in likely wilderness accidents.
*January 1933, a Mining electrician named J.A. &quot;Tex&quot; Bradford of Globe Arizona went in search of the &quot;Lost Dutchman Mine&quot;; by October 1933, he had been missing for nine months.
* In his 1945 book about the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s mine, &quot;Thunder God&#x27;s Gold&quot;, Barry Storm (pen name of John Griffith Climenson) claimed to have narrowly escaped from a mysterious sniper he dubbed &quot;Mr. X&quot;. Storm further speculated that Adolph Ruth might have been a victim of the same sniper.
* July 3, 1947, James A Cravey, age 62, a retired photographer, was reported missing after he had chartered a helicopter June 19, 1947, to drop him off in the Superstition Mountains, to look for the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine. Cravey said he would walk out of the mountains on June 28, 1947. His headless remains were reportedly discovered in the Superstition Mountains in the mid-1940s. 
* On November 9, 1949, copper prospector James Kidd went to work in the Superstition Mountains and never returned. He has never been found.
* In February 1951, Oregon physician John Burns was found shot to death in the mountains. About a year later in 1952, Joseph Kelley from Dayton, Ohio, vanished. Two years later, only his skull was found, which contained bullet wounds.
* Charles Massey came from nearby Tucson, accompanied by a few friends, with plans to hunt in the mountains. While in the Superstitions, he became separated from the main party and was never seen alive again. On February 24, 1955, his skeleton was found. Massey had been shot directly between the eyes. A brief year later, the body of Martin G. Zywotho of Brooklyn, New York, was discovered with a bullet hole in the head. 
* On March 21, 1961, the body of Walter J. Mowry of Denver, Colorado, was recovered from its resting place near Weaver&#x27;s Needle. A coroner&#x27;s jury ruled that his death was caused by a gunshot wound inflicted by a person or persons unknown. That same year, the fully-clothed skeleton of Charles Bohen, a Salt Lake City man, was also found. Despite that he was buried in a shallow grave of sand with a bullet hole in his back, his death was officially ruled a &quot;suicide.&quot; In June 1961, Jay Clapp, a peaceful recluse who lived in a cave in the Superstitions, disappeared. Clapp&#x27;s headless skeleton was found some three years later, but the cause of death is still &quot;unknown.&quot; 
* The unidentified skeletal remains of Apache Junction John Doe were found on November 23, 1969. He was found with a gunshot wound to the temple.
* On January 28, 1981, Suzanne Rosetti was kidnapped by two men, Jess James Gillies and Michael Logan, and taken to Fish Creek Hill in the Superstition Mountains, where she was pushed off a 40-foot cliff. Despite begging to be allowed to die in peace, her killers climbed down and struck and buried her alive with rocks. Gillies was executed on January 13, 1999, while Logan was sentenced to life in prison.
* In 1992, a white male in his late 30s to early 40s was found dead in the Superstition Mountains, slain by two gunshot wounds to the back of the head. His identity remains unknown.
* On January 13, 1999, the body of Walt Gassler, a gold prospector who had been searching for (and claimed to have found) the Lost Dutchman, was found by ranch hand, Don Shade. An autopsy showed signs of a heart attack, and in his backpack was gold ore allegedly identical to that found by Jacob Waltz. Due to his ailing health, Walt had previously contacted two other prospectors, one of whom was Bob Corbin, Arizona&#x27;s Attorney General. A few months later, he&#x27;d told Bob&#x27;s partner and local historian, Tom Kollenborn, that he found the Lost Dutchman mine. He disappeared the next day after being dropped off at a local trailhead by his wife. A month after his death, Tom was contacted by someone falsely claiming to be Walt&#x27;s son, Roland. The man showed him gold similar to that which allegedly came out of the Dutchman mine, and asked Tom for the map and notes to retrace his father&#x27;s steps. Tom gave him a manuscript and backpack. Months later, Tom was giving a lecture when he was approached by the &quot;real&quot; Roland Gassler, who provided his ID. Additionally, this Roland claimed to never have received the backpack that was found on his father&#x27;s body, according to the ranch hand and Sheriff&#x27;s report. 
* On July 11, 2010, Utah hikers Curtis Merworth (49), Ardean Charles (66) and Malcolm Meeks (41) went missing in the Superstition Mountains looking for the mine. Merworth had become lost in the same area in 2009, requiring a rescue. On July 19, the Maricopa County Sheriff&#x27;s Department called off the search for the lost men. They presumably died in the summer heat. In January 2011, three sets of remains believed to be those of the lost men were recovered. 
* On August 12, 2020, local artist Khayman Welch (25) was last seen walking southeast from the parking area at Weaver&#x27;s Needle Vista Viewpoint near State Route 88 in the Tonto National Forest. That day, he did AC work with his uncle, Brian Welch, and on the way home, the two of them stopped at Weaver&#x27;s Needle Vista. After telling his uncle he wanted a &quot;better view of the sunset,&quot; Khayman walked southeast from the parking lot towards Weaver&#x27;s Needle. He has not been found.

== Lost Dutchman State Park ==

In 1977, abutting the Tonto National Forest were set aside as the Lost Dutchman State Park. The park was expanded to in 1983. It is accessible about 40 miles (64.4 km) east of Phoenix via U.S. Highway 60, the Superstition Freeway. Hiking and camping are popular activities. There are several paths that go through the brush and cacti. The short &quot;Discovery Trail&quot; is a clear route with several placards giving the natural history of the area.

== Discovery of the Lost Dutchman Mine ==
In 2024, a Popular Mechanics article was published by Dave Howard in the Nov./Dec. issue, detailing a number of searches for the lost caches of the Beale Papers. In 2023, a Cryptographer named James Simpson decoded the Ciphers of the pamphlet published in 1885, by JB Ward, a Confederate Cartographer. The Ciphers detailed the movement of a team of 30 miners from Virginia to a location of a series of Gold Mines in Arizona&#x27;s Tonto Mountains, as well as relaying information about the location of a Sentry of the Knights of the Golden Circle, named Jacob Waltz. Mentioning his homestead along the Green River Basin, it showed details behind the directions to take through a canyon to find a &quot;Cave of Millions&quot;, known today as the fabled Lost Dutchman Gold Mine. 

In the Ciphers authored by James Reavis, ringleader of the Peralta Land Grab, a dual-use system was created of the base numbers listed, and with the key using a seres of 111 ascending alphabets, climbing to the number 2906 in the 112th alphabet, the substitution produced a resulting page of plaintext letters, which were found to conceal Old English Box Ciphers. The first Cipher delivered messages of their order to conceal the location of the mines while James Reavis was under investigation. With a second set of Box Ciphers interwoven into the page, it showed an outline of a trail with landmarks starting at the base of a dam near a shallow fenn or ford. At the bottom of the map section was the phrase - For Him That Can Find Jacob Waltz&#x27;s Mines. 

The trail was marked with a starting point using the older Cursum Perficio map, from the era of Spanish Exploration and the excursions that they had made into the many canyons of the Tonto Mountains. Taking it&#x27;s course across the Rio Salado near the base of the present-day Stewart Dam, it weaves through a labyrinth of trees, and in between three large mounds into the main sections of the trailhead. A series of mines were found along the trail on either side, each with a guidestone carved along the trail pointing in the direction of the mines on the walls of the canyon. The trail continues to an Arastra at about a mile into the route, and following kerns stacked along the side of the trail, climbed into the plateau along a series of steep switchbacks, where a more ornate series of carvings and pictographs would be found along the canyon walls. A final pillar on the side of the trail in the shape of a man&#x27;s head and face would be used to locate the entrance to the mine. The entrance to the Lost Dutchman would sit on the North side of the trail, and appear as the last mine on the trail to the plateau, where a camp was found surrounded by a field of golden colored grass.

Further exploration of the trail, known locally as the Gateway Trail, provided the discovery of another series of vertical mill sites which were buried in. Seldomly used as the waters released from the dam create an impassible obstacle, the Gateway Trail has a significantly obvious route that follows into the canyon with a left-banking turn at the split in the dry river bed, carrying on for another 1000 yds. until it reaches the Arastra. With the discovery of the mines was also the discovery that older maps existed from the times of the mid-1800s, and detailed the outlines of landmarks and locations of both placer lodes as well as the relative locations of mine openings. They all feature the name of the river as the Rio Salado on them, further confirming the locations of the mines, as well as being originally used by the Spanish, dating back to an unrecorded period in the history of the Superstition Mountains.

As the discovery of these specific locations found encrypted in the ciphers of the Beale Papers were confirmed, it revealed that a number of later explorations had been made there to harness their wealth, leading eventually to the deaths of many well-known explorers, like Adolph Ruth, and Frank Fish, who were both familiar with the region and had access to the original maps that were passed along by the Spanish. This would expose the fact that the mass of mining operations of the Spanish were concentrated in that area, and with some effort, additional mines were found along the adjacent trails, leading to the speculation that they were all part of the original &quot;Peralta Mines&quot;, as one of the maps was signed by Miguel Peralta.

<text>Footloose is a 1984 American musical drama film directed by Herbert Ross and written by Dean Pitchford. It tells the story of Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon), a teenager from Chicago who moves to a small town, where he attempts to overturn a ban on dancing enforced by the efforts of a local minister (John Lithgow).

The film was released on February 17, 1984, by Paramount Pictures, and received mixed reviews from the critics, but was a box office success, grossing $80 million in North America, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 1984. The songs &quot;Footloose&quot; by Kenny Loggins and &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot; by Deniece Williams were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

==Plot==

Chicago native Ren McCormack and his mother Ethel move to the small town of Bomont, Utah to live with Ren&#x27;s aunt and uncle. While attending church, he meets Reverend Shaw Moore, his wife Vi and their daughter Ariel, who rebels against her father&#x27;s strict religious nature and behaves recklessly.

At school, Ren befriends Willard Hewitt. He soon learns that the town council has banned dancing and rock music within the town boundary. Ren soon falls for Ariel, angering her boyfriend, Chuck Cranston, who challenges him to a game of chicken involving tractors. Ren wins the challenge but only because his shoelace got caught on the foot pedal so he couldn&#x27;t jump off.

Distrusting Ren&#x27;s influence, Reverend Moore forbids Ariel from seeing him. Ren drives Willard, Ariel, and her friend, Rusty, to a bar past the state line to go dancing. Willard, unable to dance, becomes jealous and gets into a fight with a man dancing with Rusty.

On the drive home, Ariel describes how, five years earlier, her older brother died in a car accident after a night of alcohol and dancing. Their father then persuaded the town council to enact strict anti-liquor, anti-drug, and anti-dance laws. Ren decides to challenge the anti-dancing and rock music ordinance so the high school can hold a senior prom.

Willard is embarrassed he cannot dance, so Ren teaches him. Chuck confronts Ariel about her feelings towards Ren and they get into a physical altercation before breaking up. Ren helps Ariel conceal the physical assault before going home, cementing their relationship.

Later that night, someone throws a brick with the words, &quot;Burn in Hell,&quot; through a window at Ren&#x27;s house. When his uncle criticizes Ren&#x27;s outspoken behavior, Ethel tells Ren that though his actions cost her her job, he should stand up for what he believes is right.

With Ariel&#x27;s help, Ren goes before the town council to advocate revoking the anti-dancing law. He reads several Bible verses and cites the scriptural significance of dancing as a way to rejoice, exercise, and celebrate. Although Reverend Moore is moved, the council votes against Ren&#x27;s proposal. Vi, who supports the movement, tells Moore that he cannot be everyone&#x27;s father and is hardly one to Ariel.

Despite further discussion with Ren about his own family losses and Ariel telling her father she is not a virgin, Rev. Moore does not change his stance. The next day, he finds members of his congregation burning library books that they claim to endanger the town&#x27;s youth. Realizing the situation has become uncontrollable, Moore stops the book burners, chastises them, and sends them home.

The following Sunday, Reverend Moore asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom, being held in a grain mill just yards over the county line and beyond Bomont&#x27;s jurisdiction. On prom night, Moore and Vi listen from outside the mill. Chuck and his friends arrive, attacking Willard; Ren arrives in time to even the odds and knocks out Chuck. Ren, Ariel, Willard and Rusty rejoin the party and happily dance the night away.

==Cast==
==Production==
Dean Pitchford came up with the idea for &quot;Footloose&quot; in 1979 and teamed up with Daniel Melnick&#x27;s IndieProd who set the production up at 20th Century Fox in 1981. Pitchford wrote the screenplay (his first) and most of the lyrics however, Fox put it into turnaround. In 1982, Paramount Pictures made a pay-or-play deal for the film. When negotiations with Herbert Ross initially stalled, Ron Howard was approached to direct the film but he turned it down to direct &quot;Splash&quot; instead. Michael Cimino was hired by Paramount to direct the film, his first film since &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

After a month of working on the film, the studio fired Cimino, who was making extravagant demands for the production, including demanding an additional $250,000 for his work, and ended up hiring Ross.

===Casting===
Tom Cruise and Rob Lowe were both slated to play the lead. The producers were impressed with Cruise because of the famous underwear dance sequence in &quot;Risky Business&quot;, but he was unavailable for the part because he was filming &quot;All the Right Moves&quot;. Lowe auditioned three times and had the dancing ability and the &quot;neutral teen&quot; look that the director wanted, but injury prevented him from taking the part. Christopher Atkins claims that he was cast as Ren, but lost the role. Bacon had been offered the main role for the Stephen King film &quot;Christine&quot; at the same time that he was asked to do the screen test for &quot;Footloose&quot;. He chose to take the gamble on the screen test. After watching his earlier film &quot;Diner&quot;, the director persuaded the producers to go with Bacon.

The film also stars Lori Singer as Reverend Moore&#x27;s independent daughter Ariel, a role for which Madonna and Haviland Morris also auditioned. Valerie Bertinelli and Jennifer Jason Leigh were also considered. Dianne Wiest appears as Vi, the Reverend&#x27;s devoted yet conflicted wife.

Tracy Nelson was considered for the role of Rusty.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on May 9, 1983, and took place at various locations in Utah County, Utah. The high school and tractor scenes were filmed in and around Payson and Payson High School. The church scenes were filmed at the First Presbyterian Church in American Fork, while the steel mill was the Geneva Steel facility in Vineyard and The Lehi Roller Mills were the location where Bacon&#x27;s character worked (Bacon briefly worked at the roller mill as research for his performance). The drive-in scenes were filmed in Provo at what was then a branch of the Hi-Spot burger chain. The restaurant chain closed in the late 1980s, and there is now an auto parts store at that location. The bar scene was filmed at The Silver Spur bar in downtown Provo. The bar and other surrounding buildings were demolished to make way for the Utah Valley Convention Center.

For his dance scene in the warehouse, Bacon said he had four stunt doubles: &quot;I had a stunt double, a dance double [Peter Tramm] and two gymnastics doubles.&quot;

=== Film inspiration ===
&quot;Footloose&quot; is loosely based on the town of Elmore City, Oklahoma. The town had banned dancing since its founding in 1898 in an attempt to decrease the amount of heavy drinking. One advocate of the dancing ban was the Reverend from the nearby town of Hennepin, F. R. Johnson. He said, &quot;No good has ever come from a dance. If you have a dance somebody will crash it and they&#x27;ll be looking for only two things—women and booze. When boys and girls hold each other, they get sexually aroused. You can believe what you want, but one thing leads to another.&quot; Because of the ban on dancing, the town never held a prom. In February 1980, the junior class of Elmore City&#x27;s high school made national news when they requested permission to hold a junior prom and it was granted. The request to overturn the ban to hold the prom was met with a 2–2 decision from the school board when school board president Raymond Lee broke the tie with the words, &quot;Let &#x27;em dance.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was released in cassette, 8-track tape, vinyl, reel-to-reel and CD format. The 1984 open reel release was among the last commercial releases on the format. The soundtrack was also re-released on CD for the 15th anniversary of the film in 1999. The re-release included four new songs: &quot;Bang Your Head (Metal Health)&quot; by Quiet Riot, &quot;Hurts So Good&quot; by John Mellencamp, &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; by Foreigner, and the extended 12&quot; remix of &quot;Dancing in the Sheets&quot;.

The album includes &quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Free (Heaven Helps the Man)&quot;, both by Kenny Loggins, &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot; by Bonnie Tyler (co-written and produced by Jim Steinman), &quot;Girl Gets Around&quot; by Sammy Hagar, &quot;Never&quot; by Australian rock band Moving Pictures, &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot; by Deniece Williams, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Eyes&quot; by Karla Bonoff, &quot;Dancing In The Sheets&quot; by Shalamar, and the romantic theme &quot;Almost Paradise&quot; by Mike Reno from Loverboy and Ann Wilson of Heart (co-written by Eric Carmen). The soundtrack went on to sell over 9 million copies in the USA. All songs in the initial release were co-written by Pitchford based on various songwriting styles: for &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;, he listened to various songs written by Steinman such as his work with Meat Loaf and then wrote the first two lines (&quot;Where have all the good men gone/And where are all the gods?/Where&#x27;s the streetwise Hercules/To fight the rising odds?&quot;) in this manner to spark Steinman&#x27;s creativity.

&quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot; both topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and received 1985 Academy Award nominations for Best Music (Original Song). &quot;Footloose&quot; also received a 1985 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Song – Motion Picture.

Composer Miles Goodman adapted and orchestrated the film&#x27;s score.

The music from the soundtrack was released prior to the film&#x27;s premiere. The filmmakers felt that songs produced a stronger emotional response from people already familiar with them, which heightened the experience of watching the movie. The music video for &quot;Footloose&quot; had scenes from the movie, rather than footage of Loggins.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert called it &quot;a seriously confused movie that tries to do three things, and does all of them badly. It wants to tell the story of a conflict in a town, it wants to introduce some flashy teenage characters and part of the time it wants to be a music video.&quot; Dave Denby in &quot;New York&quot; rechristened the film &quot;Schlockdance&quot;, writing: &quot;&quot;Footloose&quot; may be a hit, but it&#x27;s trash – high powered fodder for the teen market... The only person to come out of the film better off is the smooth-cheeked, pug-nosed Bacon, who gives a cocky but likable Mr. Cool performance.&quot;

Jane Lamacraft reassessed the film for &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; &quot;Forgotten pleasures of the multiplex&quot; feature in 2010, writing &quot;Nearly three decades on, Bacon&#x27;s vest-clad set-piece dance in a flour mill looks cheesily 1980s, but the rest of Ross&#x27;s drama wears its age well, real song-and-dance joy for the pre-&quot;Glee&quot; generation.&quot;

 On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Box office===
The film grossed $80,035,403 domestically. It became the seventh highest-grossing film of 1984.

===Accolades===
;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
* &quot;Footloose&quot; – #96

==Musical adaptation==

In 1998, a musical version of &quot;Footloose&quot; premiered. Featuring many of the songs from the film, the show has been presented on London&#x27;s West End, on Broadway, and elsewhere. The musical is generally faithful to the film version, with some slight differences in the story and characters.

==Remake==

Paramount announced plans to fast-track a remake of &quot;Footloose&quot;. The remake was written and directed by Craig Brewer. Filming started in September 2010. It was budgeted at $25 million. It was released October 14, 2011.

<doc id="877745" wikidata="Q1370988" url="?curid=877745" title="Salamander (video game)">
<text>, retitled in North America and in the Japanese arcade re-release, is a scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and published by Konami. Released in 1986 as a spin-off of &quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Salamander&quot; introduced a simplified power-up system, two-player cooperative gameplay and both horizontally and vertically scrolling stages. Some of these later became normal for future &quot;Gradius&quot; games. In Japanese, the title is written using ateji, which are kanji used for spelling foreign words that has been supplanted in everyday use by katakana. &quot;Contra&quot;, another game by Konami was also given this treatment, with its title written in Japanese as .

&quot;Salamander&quot; was followed with a sequel in 1996 titled &quot;Salamander 2&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The first player controls Vic Viper and the second player takes the reins of debuting spacecraft Lord British, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;Road British&quot; due to the ambiguity of Japanese-to-English romanization. The game features six stages which alter between horizontal and vertical scrolling.

Players are allowed to continue from where they leave upon death instead of being returned to a predefined checkpoint as per &quot;Gradius&quot; tradition. There are no continues in single player mode, and two in the two-player mode. The number of continues can be changed through DIP switches. The player gains power-ups by picking up capsules left behind by certain enemies, as opposed to the selection bar used in other &quot;Gradius&quot; games. However, the Japanese version of &quot;Life Force&quot; keeps the selection bar.

Many of the power-ups can be combined. For example, an option fires a second (or third) salvo of missiles or ripple/plutonic lasers if these power-ups have been attained. The ripple and laser, however, are mutually exclusive. The only power-up that can survive the ship&#x27;s destruction is the options (called &quot;multiples&quot; in the English release), they followed the exact flight path of the player&#x27;s ship and fired when they did, but were otherwise invulnerable. Upon the ship&#x27;s destruction, the options float in space for a brief time before disappearing; the new ship can grab and retain them.

==Development==
The arcade version of the game was released under its original title in Japan and Europe, and as &quot;Life Force&quot; in North America. The Japanese and European versions are nearly identical, but the American version changes the game&#x27;s plot by adding an opening text that establishes the game to be set inside a giant alien life-form which is infected by a strain of bacteria. Stages that feature starfield backgrounds were changed to the web background from Stage 1 to maintain consistency with the organic setting of the plot. The power-ups are also given different names, with the &quot;Speed-Up&quot; becoming &quot;Hyper Speed&quot;, the &quot;Missile&quot; becoming the &quot;Destruct Missile&quot;, the &quot;Ripple Laser&quot; becoming the &quot;Pulse Laser&quot; and &quot;Force Field&quot; becoming the &quot;Shield&quot;. Narration is added to the beginning of each stage, detailing the area of the alien&#x27;s body which the player is currently inhabiting such as &quot;Enter stomach muscle zone&quot; or &quot;Bio-mechanical brain attack&quot;.

Konami later released an enhanced version of &quot;Salamander&quot; in Japan in 1987 bearing the American title of &quot;Life Force&quot; which further fleshes out the organic motif. All of the backgrounds and mechanical enemies are completely redrawn and given organic appearances. The power-up system was also modified, with the Japanese &quot;Life Force&quot; using the same power-up gauge as the original &quot;Gradius&quot;. Some music tracks have been completely changed for this release and the power-up gauge is arranged differently for both players.

==Ports==

===Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum===
Ocean Software on their Imagine label, released licensed versions of &quot;Salamander&quot; for computer systems by Spectrum, Commodore and Amstrad in 1988. The Spectrum and Amstrad versions were generally criticized, but the Commodore 64 version was highly praised by the critics of the day, particularly &quot;Zzap!64&quot;. Though missing two of the six stages, the simultaneous two player mode and gameplay being much easier than its arcade counterpart, the Commodore port is generally considered to be one of the best arcade conversions on this system.

===Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System===
&quot;Salamander&quot; was ported to the Family Computer in Japan in 1987. Instead of being a direct port of &quot;Salamander&quot;, elements were taken from the original &quot;Salamander&quot; and the Japanese &quot;Life Force&quot; re-release, and some elements, such as levels and bosses, were removed to make way for new content. Most of the background graphics and enemy sprites from &quot;Salamander&quot; are used in favor of those used in &quot;Life Force&quot;, though the &quot;Gradius&quot;-style power bar is used in place of the original instant pick-up system. In 1988, North America received a port as well for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The NES version is practically identical to its Famicom equivalent, other than not having the multiple endings, having two option power ups instead of three, and being titled &quot;Life Force&quot;. The North America version was later re-released for the Virtual Console on February 16, 2009 for the Wii, on January 23, 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS and August 21, 2014 for the Wii U. The European version is titled &quot;Life Force Salamander&quot; on its cover and was released on November 22, 1989. The NES version makes use of the Konami Code, which increases the number of lives from three to 30. The first two levels of &quot;Life Force&quot; were profiled in the second issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, issued in 1988. Several issues later the entire game was re-profiled.

===MSX===
The MSX port of is significantly different from the original and any other ports. New to this port is a graphical introduction that introduces human pilots for each ship, as well as names for each stage. The levels are notably longer than the arcade original, and the player is forced to start from a pre-defined checkpoint upon death of either pilot, instead of starting where he left off. After level two, the player can choose the order of the next three stages. In addition, the player can collect &quot;E&quot; capsules by destroying certain enemies. Collecting fifteen will permanently upgrade one of the available weapons on the power-up bar. Some weapons allow the player ships to merge, one player controlling movements and the second player controlling weapons. Instead of the Vic Viper and the Lord British Space Destroyer, the ships are known as the Sabel Tiger and the Thrasher; piloted by human characters named Iggy Rock and Zowie Scott. The story takes place in the year 6709 A.D and has 2 different endings. The MSX version was re-released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in Japan on January 12, 2010. It was later released for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console on July 20, 2016. They were also made available for the Project EGG on Windows Store on May 19, 2015.

===PC Engine===
A version for the PC Engine was released on December 6, 1991. Based on the arcade version of &quot;Salamander&quot;, changes on this port include starting from a pre-defined checkpoint upon death in 1 Player mode, faster enemy animations, and improved music. In Japan, the PC Engine version was re-released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console on September 11, 2007, for PlayStation Network on July 21, 2010 and for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console on October 22, 2014, and also for the Project EGG con Windows Store on March 3, 2014. It was released in North America on November 16, 2017 for the Wii U Virtual Console. The PC version is on the TurboGrafx-16 Mini released in 2020 and is the sole title from the compilation that is excluded from the Japanese model while being included in the North American and European ones.

===PlayStation and Sega Saturn===
A compilation titled &quot;Salamander Deluxe Pack Plus&quot; was released in Japan for the Sega Saturn on June 19, 1997, and for the PlayStation on July 6 of the same year. The compilation includes &quot;Salamander&quot;, the Japanese version of &quot;Life Force&quot;, and &quot;Salamander 2&quot;. Konami announced that the PlayStation version would be released in the U.S. as part of a bundle with &quot;Gradius Gaiden&quot;, but this release was later cancelled.

===Mobile Phones===
&quot;Salamander&quot; was released for mobile phones in 2003.

===PlayStation 4===
All three arcade versions (&quot;Salamander&quot;, and the American and Japanese adaptations of &quot;Life Force&quot;) were ported to the Arcade Archives on November 27, 2015 in Japan exclusively for PlayStation 4. It was later released worldwide in Spring 2016. It was published by Hamster Corporation.

===PlayStation Portable===
Another compilation of the &quot;Salamander&quot; series, titled &quot;Salamander Portable&quot;, was released for the PlayStation Portable on January 24, 2007 in Japan. The PSP compilation features all three games previously included in the &quot;Salamander Deluxe Pack Plus&quot;, as well as &quot;Xexex&quot; and the MSX version of &quot;Gradius 2&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Nemesis II&quot;, which is unrelated to the arcade game &quot;Gradius II: Gofer&#x27;s Ambition&quot;).

===iOS===
On December 20, 2010, an application called &quot;PC Engine Game Box&quot; was published in the App Store which served as a portal to download classic PC Engine video games. Among the downloadable titles is the PC Engine version of &quot;Salamander&quot; for a fee.

===&quot;Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection&quot;===
The arcade version is included on Konami&#x27;s &quot;Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection&quot; released in April 2019 in digital-only format for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. Initially, the compilation in Japan only had the &quot;Salamander&quot; version of the game, while everywhere else featured the American &quot;Life Force&quot; instead. In June 2019, Konami added for free the Japanese versions of the respective games on the western &quot;Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection&quot;. Only the &quot;Salamander&quot; version can be played in this addition, as the Japanese &quot;Life Force&quot; is not part of the compilation. Conversely, the American version of &quot;Life Force&quot; was added to the collection in Japan in that same update.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Salamander&quot; on their August 15, 1986 issue as being the second most successful table arcade unit of the month. It went on to be the top-grossing arcade game on Japan&#x27;s &quot;Gamest&quot; charts between September and October 1986.

In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; rated the NES version the 76th best console video game of all time, calling it &quot;one of the coolest shooters ever, and ... one of the first big two-player simultaneous shooters on the NES.&quot; They particularly noted that the graphics in the fire stage were &quot;mind-blowing back in the day&quot;. In 1993, &quot;Commodore Force&quot; ranked the game at number 19 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.

==Anime==
 is a 1988 OVA miniseries by Studio Pierrot, directed by Hisayuki Toriumi. There were three episodes released on VHS and Laserdisc between February 25, 1988 and February 21, 1989. The series was licensed by a British company Western Connection. The series is not canon, however; as the &quot;MSX Gradius&quot; series states that the events with Gofer take place over a two-hundred year period following the crisis with Zelos and his Salamander Armada. In this miniseries, it is revealed that the Bacterians capture sentient life to create leaders for their space armada. They capture sentient life via a dark fog going through space that changes inorganic matter into organic matter (the large brain-like final bosses in the games); and that they are a crystal-like life-form in origin. Noriko Hidaka provided the voice of the protagonist Stephanie. In the anime, the Lord British Space Destroyer was named after one of the protagonists, Ike Lord British of planet Latis; thus making it Lord British&#x27;s Space Destroyer.

<text>PowerJet is a Franco-Russian 50-50 joint venture created in 2004 by aeronautical engine manufacturers Snecma (Safran) and NPO Saturn. The company is in charge of the SaM146 program – the sole powerplant for the Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner – including design, production, marketing and after-sales support. It delivers a complete propulsion system, comprising engine, nacelle and equipment.

PowerJet has two production sites: one in Villaroche (France) and the other in Rybinsk (Russia).

== History ==

Snecma and NPO Saturn began cooperating in 1998, when Snecma subcontracted the production of CFM56 engine parts to NPO Saturn. In 2004, the creation of the PowerJet joint venture took the collaboration a step further. 

In 2005, the production plant VolgAero was founded in Rybinsk, in order to make parts for the SaM146, as well as parts and assemblies for other engines produced by the two parent companies.

In 2007, Snecma and NPO Saturn built an open-air test cell in Poluevo, near Rybinsk, to handle certification tests for the SaM146. It is the only open-air test facility for this type of engine in Europe and it also provides test services for other engines.

On 23 June 2010, it was announced that EASA certified PowerJet for its SaM146 engine. It gained Russian certification in August 2010 and the following year the Superjet 100 entered service.

In late March of 2022, following international sanctions against Russia over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, PowerJet terminated its contract to provide parts, technical support, engine maintenance, or repair services with regard to the SaM146.

<doc id="877760" wikidata="Q5235962" url="?curid=877760" title="David Kerr (Northern Irish politician)">
<text>David Thomas Kerr (born 1957) is a Northern Irish politician who is the Chairman of the UK-wide Third Way.

==Early and personal life==
Kerr was born in Belfast and, as of 2005, lived in the city&#x27;s Shankill Road area.

==National Front==
Kerr began his political career as a member of the National Front (NF) in 1986, siding with the Political Soldier wing of the party during what was a period of internal division. He was a candidate for the party in Newtownabbey Borough Council twice during this period. As an NF member Kerr also chaired the North Belfast Independent Unionist Association, where he first developed his ideas on Ulster nationalism. As a regular columnist for &quot;Nationalism Today&quot;, the ideological journal of the Official National Front, Kerr frequently wrote on the topic of Ulster nationalism, which became the policy of the ONF in relation to Northern Ireland (in contrast to previous NF policy, which was supportive of Ulster loyalism).

==Third Way==
Kerr voted with others to disband the NF in 1989. In 1990, he was one of the founder members of Third Way, (which is now a think-tank). He is current party chairman of the offshoot National Liberal Party (NLP). Kerr is also the main force behind the Ulster Third Way, which acts as the Northern Ireland arm of the party whilst placing the main emphasis on the independence aspect. In the 2001 United Kingdom general election Kerr stood in the West Belfast constituency as a Third Way candidate but secured only 116 votes (a 0.3% share). He is also a regular writer for various party publications.

==Ulster nationalism==
As stated previously, Kerr has long been an advocate of an independent Northern Ireland and to this end he is the editor of &quot;Ulster Nation&quot;, the only current publication that advocates this position. In electoral terms, Kerr had also stood as a candidate in the European elections of 1994 under the title of &#x27;Independent Ulster&#x27;. Somewhat oddly, given the peripheral nature of the independence position, Kerr was one of three candidates advocating this stance (Rev. Hugh Ross and Robert Mooney being the other two) and, as a result, suffered from a split vote to capture only 578 votes in what was a single Province-wide constituency. In the aftermath of this election a general meeting of pro-independence groups and individuals was organised by Ross after overtures were sent out to Kerr, Mooney and the Ballymena-based Ulster Party. Mooney, who had run as Constitutional Independent Northern Ireland and later formed the short-lived Northern Ireland Party, did not turn up but Kerr and Agnes McLeister of the Ulster Party (another minute group that was also Ballymena-based) agreed to pool resources and join forces with Ross&#x27;s movement. Kerr went on to appear on the candidate list for the Ulster Independence Movement in the 1996 Forum election and the 1998 election to the Northern Ireland Assembly, although he was not elected.

Kerr is also the author of a book about one of the pioneers of Ulster nationalism, W. F. McCoy.

==2005 general election==
Most recently, in the 2005 general election, Kerr stood in the East Antrim constituency as a candidate for the Vote For Yourself Party, gaining 147 votes (0.5%). Kerr, who remains a Third Way member despite his candidature, claimed to be standing for the party as he endorsed their support for the use of referendums to decide policy. In a post on the Slugger O&#x27;Toole blog he explained &quot;Rainbow George contacted me and asked me to stand for the Vote For Yourself Rainbow Dream Ticket in a constituency outside Belfast in order to promote the ideas that Third Way and the Rainbow Dream Ticket share – Direct democracy&quot;.

==Solidarity trade union==
David Kerr was elected for a five-year period to the National Executive of Solidarity – The Union for British Workers in November 2007 and helped to launch the group in the province over the Twelfth in 2007.

==Miscellaneous==
He wrote a regular column, &#x27;Kerr&#x27;s Corner&#x27;, in the Carrickfergus and North Belfast editions of &quot;The Belfast Biz&quot; (formerly &quot;The Wizard&quot;), a local freesheet. He is a keen cyclist in his spare time and is described on the Third Way&#x27;s website as having a strong interest in environmental and housing issues.

Kerr is a supporter of Neo-Confederate policies in the Southern United States and has declared his support for the re-establishment of the Confederate States of America. However, in an interview conducted for Cornell University in 2003 Kerr confirmed that, despite taking this position, neither he as an individual nor Ulster Third Way as a group had established any formal links with any Neo-Confederate groups.

<doc id="877761" wikidata="Q1293273" url="?curid=877761" title="Stiefel–Whitney class">
<text>In mathematics, in particular in algebraic topology and differential geometry, the Stiefel–Whitney classes are a set of topological invariants of a real vector bundle that describe the obstructions to constructing everywhere independent sets of sections of the vector bundle. Stiefel–Whitney classes are indexed from 0 to &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the rank of the vector bundle. If the Stiefel–Whitney class of index &quot;i&quot; is nonzero, then there cannot exist formula_1 everywhere linearly independent sections of the vector bundle. A nonzero &quot;n&quot;th Stiefel–Whitney class indicates that every section of the bundle must vanish at some point. A nonzero first Stiefel–Whitney class indicates that the vector bundle is not orientable. For example, the first Stiefel–Whitney class of the Möbius strip, as a line bundle over the circle, is not zero, whereas the first Stiefel–Whitney class of the trivial line bundle over the circle, formula_2, is zero.

The Stiefel–Whitney class was named for Eduard Stiefel and Hassler Whitney and is an example of a formula_3-characteristic class associated to real vector bundles.

In algebraic geometry one can also define analogous Stiefel–Whitney classes for vector bundles with a non-degenerate quadratic form, taking values in etale cohomology groups or in Milnor K-theory. As a special case one can define Stiefel–Whitney classes for quadratic forms over fields, the first two cases being the discriminant and the Hasse–Witt invariant .

==Introduction==

===General presentation===
For a real vector bundle , the Stiefel–Whitney class of is denoted by . It is an element of the cohomology ring

:formula_4

where is the base space of the bundle , and formula_3 (often alternatively denoted by formula_6) is the commutative ring whose only elements are 0 and 1. The component of formula_7 in formula_8 is denoted by formula_9 and called the -th Stiefel–Whitney class of . Thus, 

:formula_10, 

where each formula_9 is an element of formula_8.

The Stiefel–Whitney class formula_7 is an invariant of the real vector bundle ; i.e., when is another real vector bundle which has the same base space as , and if is isomorphic to , then the Stiefel–Whitney classes formula_7 and formula_15 are equal. (Here &quot;isomorphic&quot; means that there exists a vector bundle isomorphism formula_16 which covers the identity formula_17.) While it is in general difficult to decide whether two real vector bundles and are isomorphic, the Stiefel–Whitney classes formula_7 and formula_15 can often be computed easily. If they are different, one knows that and are not isomorphic.

As an example, over the circle formula_20, there is a line bundle (i.e., a real vector bundle of rank 1) that is not isomorphic to a trivial bundle. This line bundle is the Möbius strip (which is a fiber bundle whose fibers can be equipped with vector space structures in such a way that it becomes a vector bundle). The cohomology group formula_21 has just one element other than 0. This element is the first Stiefel–Whitney class formula_22 of . Since the trivial line bundle over formula_20 has first Stiefel–Whitney class 0, it is not isomorphic to .

Two real vector bundles and which have the same Stiefel–Whitney class are not necessarily isomorphic. This happens for instance when and are trivial real vector bundles of different ranks over the same base space . It can also happen when and have the same rank: the tangent bundle of the 2-sphere formula_24 and the trivial real vector bundle of rank 2 over formula_24 have the same Stiefel–Whitney class, but they are not isomorphic. But if two real &quot;line&quot; bundles over have the same Stiefel–Whitney class, then they are isomorphic.

===Origins===
The Stiefel–Whitney classes formula_9 get their name because Eduard Stiefel and Hassler Whitney discovered them as mod-2 reductions of the obstruction classes to constructing formula_27 everywhere linearly independent sections of the vector bundle restricted to the &quot;i&quot;-skeleton of &quot;X&quot;. Here &quot;n&quot; denotes the dimension of the fibre of the vector bundle formula_28.

To be precise, provided &quot;X&quot; is a CW-complex, Whitney defined classes formula_29 in the &quot;i&quot;-th cellular cohomology group of &quot;X&quot; with twisted coefficients. The coefficient system being the formula_30-st homotopy group of the Stiefel manifold formula_31 of formula_27 linearly independent vectors in the fibres of &quot;E&quot;. Whitney proved that formula_33 if and only if &quot;E&quot;, when restricted to the &quot;i&quot;-skeleton of &quot;X&quot;, has formula_27 linearly-independent sections.

Since formula_35 is either infinite-cyclic or isomorphic to formula_3, there is a canonical reduction of the formula_29 classes to classes formula_38 which are the Stiefel–Whitney classes. Moreover, whenever formula_39, the two classes are identical. Thus, formula_40 if and only if the bundle formula_41 is orientable.

The formula_42 class contains no information, because it is equal to 1 by definition. Its creation by Whitney was an act of creative notation, allowing the Whitney sum Formula formula_43 to be true.

==Definitions==
Throughout, formula_44 denotes singular cohomology of a space with coefficients in the group . The word &quot;map&quot; means always a continuous function between topological spaces.

===Axiomatic definition===
The Stiefel-Whitney characteristic class formula_45 of a finite rank real vector bundle &quot;E&quot; on a paracompact base space &quot;X&quot; is defined as the unique class such that the following axioms are fulfilled:

# Normalization: The Whitney class of the tautological line bundle over the real projective space formula_46 is nontrivial, i.e., formula_47.
# Rank: formula_48 and for &quot;i&quot; above the rank of &quot;E&quot;, formula_49, that is, formula_50
# Whitney product formula: formula_51, that is, the Whitney class of a direct sum is the cup product of the summands&#x27; classes.
# Naturality: formula_52 for any real vector bundle formula_53 and map formula_54, where formula_55 denotes the pullback vector bundle.

The uniqueness of these classes is proved for example, in section 17.2 – 17.6 in Husemoller or section 8 in Milnor and Stasheff. There are several proofs of the existence, coming from various constructions, with several different flavours, their coherence is ensured by the unicity statement.

===Definition &quot;via&quot; infinite Grassmannians===

==== The infinite Grassmannians and vector bundles ====
This section describes a construction using the notion of classifying space.

For any vector space &quot;V&quot;, let formula_56 denote the Grassmannian, the space of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional linear subspaces of &quot;V&quot;, and denote the infinite Grassmannian

:formula_57.

Recall that it is equipped with the tautological bundle formula_58 a rank &quot;n&quot; vector bundle that can be defined as the subbundle of the trivial bundle of fiber &quot;V&quot; whose fiber at a point formula_59 is the subspace represented by &quot;W&quot;.

Let formula_60, be a continuous map to the infinite Grassmannian. Then, up to isomorphism, the bundle induced by the map &quot;f&quot; on &quot;X&quot;

:formula_61

depends only on the homotopy class of the map [&quot;f&quot;]. The pullback operation thus gives a morphism from the set

:formula_62

of maps formula_63 &quot;modulo&quot; homotopy equivalence, to the set

:formula_64

of isomorphism classes of vector bundles of rank &quot;n&quot; over &quot;X&quot;.

(The important fact in this construction is that if &quot;X&quot; is a paracompact space, this map is a bijection. This is the reason why we call infinite Grassmannians the classifying spaces of vector bundles.)

Now, by the naturality axiom (4) above, formula_65. So it suffices in principle to know the values of formula_66 for all &quot;j&quot;. However, the cohomology ring formula_67 is free on specific generators formula_68 arising from a standard cell decomposition, and it then turns out that these generators are in fact just given by formula_69. Thus, for any rank-n bundle, formula_70, where &quot;f&quot; is the appropriate classifying map. This in particular provides one proof of the existence of the Stiefel–Whitney classes.

====The case of line bundles====
We now restrict the above construction to line bundles, &quot;ie&quot; we consider the space, formula_71 of line bundles over &quot;X&quot;. The Grassmannian of lines formula_72 is just the infinite projective space

:formula_73

which is doubly covered by the infinite sphere formula_74 with antipodal points as fibres. This sphere formula_74 is contractible, so we have

:formula_76

Hence P∞(R) is the Eilenberg-Maclane space formula_77.

It is a property of Eilenberg-Maclane spaces, that

:formula_78

for any &quot;X&quot;, with the isomorphism given by &quot;f&quot; → &quot;f*&quot;η, where η is the generator

:formula_79.

Applying the former remark that α : [&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Gr&quot;1] → Vect1(&quot;X&quot;) is also a bijection, we obtain a bijection

:formula_80

this defines the Stiefel–Whitney class &quot;w&quot;1 for line bundles.

==== The group of line bundles ====
If Vect1(&quot;X&quot;) is considered as a group under the operation of tensor product, then the Stiefel–Whitney class, &quot;w&quot;1 : Vect1(&quot;X&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;X&quot;; Z/2Z), is an isomorphism. That is, &quot;w&quot;1(λ ⊗ μ) = &quot;w&quot;1(λ) + &quot;w&quot;1(μ) for all line bundles λ, μ → &quot;X&quot;.

For example, since &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;S&quot;1; Z/2Z) = Z/2Z, there are only two line bundles over the circle up to bundle isomorphism: the trivial one, and the open Möbius strip (i.e., the Möbius strip with its boundary deleted).

The same construction for complex vector bundles shows that the Chern class defines a bijection between complex line bundles over &quot;X&quot; and &quot;H&quot;2(&quot;X&quot;; Z), because the corresponding classifying space is P∞(C), a K(Z, 2). This isomorphism is true for topological line bundles, the obstruction to injectivity of the Chern class for algebraic vector bundles is the Jacobian variety.

==Properties==

===Topological interpretation of vanishing===
# &quot;wi&quot;(&quot;E&quot;) = 0 whenever &quot;i&quot; &gt; rank(&quot;E&quot;).
# If &quot;Ek&quot; has formula_81 sections which are everywhere linearly independent then the formula_82 top degree Whitney classes vanish: formula_83.
#The first Stiefel–Whitney class is zero if and only if the bundle is orientable. In particular, a manifold &quot;M&quot; is orientable if and only if &quot;w&quot;1(&quot;TM&quot;) = 0.
#The bundle admits a spin structure if and only if both the first and second Stiefel–Whitney classes are zero.
#For an orientable bundle, the second Stiefel–Whitney class is in the image of the natural map &quot;H&quot;2(&quot;M&quot;, Z) → &quot;H&quot;2(&quot;M&quot;, Z/2Z) (equivalently, the so-called third integral Stiefel–Whitney class is zero) if and only if the bundle admits a spinc structure.
#All the Stiefel–Whitney &quot;numbers&quot; (see below) of a smooth compact manifold &quot;X&quot; vanish if and only if the manifold is the boundary of some smooth compact (unoriented) manifold (Note that some Stiefel-Whitney &quot;class&quot; could still be non-zero, even if all the Stiefel- Whitney &quot;numbers&quot; vanish!)

===Uniqueness of the Stiefel–Whitney classes===
The bijection above for line bundles implies that any functor θ satisfying the four axioms above is equal to &quot;w&quot;, by the following argument. The second axiom yields θ(γ1) = 1 + θ1(γ1). For the inclusion map &quot;i&quot; : P1(R) → P∞(R), the pullback bundle formula_84 is equal to formula_85. Thus the first and third axiom imply

:formula_86

Since the map

:formula_87

is an isomorphism, formula_88 and θ(γ1) = &quot;w&quot;(γ1) follow. Let &quot;E&quot; be a real vector bundle of rank &quot;n&quot; over a space &quot;X&quot;. Then &quot;E&quot; admits a splitting map, i.e. a map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X′&quot; → &quot;X&quot; for some space &quot;X′&quot; such that formula_89 is injective and formula_90 for some line bundles formula_91. Any line bundle over &quot;X&quot; is of the form formula_92 for some map &quot;g&quot;, and

:formula_93

by naturality. Thus θ = &quot;w&quot; on formula_94. It follows from the fourth axiom above that

:formula_95

Since formula_96 is injective, θ = &quot;w&quot;. Thus the Stiefel–Whitney class is the unique functor satisfying the four axioms above.

===Non-isomorphic bundles with the same Stiefel–Whitney classes===
Although the map formula_97 is a bijection, the corresponding map is not necessarily injective in higher dimensions. For example, consider the tangent bundle formula_98 for &quot;n&quot; even. With the canonical embedding of formula_99 in formula_100, the normal bundle formula_101 to formula_99 is a line bundle. Since formula_99 is orientable, formula_101 is trivial. The sum formula_105 is just the restriction of formula_106 to formula_99, which is trivial since formula_100 is contractible. Hence &quot;w&quot;(&quot;TSn&quot;) = &quot;w&quot;(&quot;TSn&quot;)&quot;w&quot;(ν) = w(&quot;TSn&quot; ⊕ ν) = 1. But, provided n is even, &quot;TSn&quot; → &quot;Sn&quot; is not trivial; its Euler class formula_109, where [&quot;Sn&quot;] denotes a fundamental class of &quot;Sn&quot; and χ the Euler characteristic.

==Related invariants==

===Stiefel–Whitney numbers===
If we work on a manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot;, then any product of Stiefel–Whitney classes of total degree &quot;n&quot; can be paired with the Z/2Z-fundamental class of the manifold to give an element of Z/2Z, a Stiefel–Whitney number of the vector bundle. For example, if the manifold has dimension 3, there are three linearly independent Stiefel–Whitney numbers, given by formula_110. In general, if the manifold has dimension &quot;n&quot;, the number of possible independent Stiefel–Whitney numbers is the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot;.

The Stiefel–Whitney numbers of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold are called the Stiefel–Whitney numbers of the manifold. They are known to be cobordism invariants. It was proven by Lev Pontryagin that if &quot;B&quot; is a smooth compact (&quot;n&quot;+1)–dimensional manifold with boundary equal to &quot;M&quot;, then the Stiefel-Whitney numbers of &quot;M&quot; are all zero. Moreover, it was proved by René Thom that if all the Stiefel-Whitney numbers of &quot;M&quot; are zero then &quot;M&quot; can be realised as the boundary of some smooth compact manifold.

One Stiefel–Whitney number of importance in surgery theory is the &quot;de Rham invariant&quot; of a (4&quot;k&quot;+1)-dimensional manifold, formula_111

===Wu classes===
The Stiefel–Whitney classes formula_112 are the Steenrod squares of the Wu classes formula_113, defined by Wu Wenjun in 1947. Most simply, the total Stiefel–Whitney class is the total Steenrod square of the total Wu class: formula_114. Wu classes are most often defined implicitly in terms of Steenrod squares, as the cohomology class representing the Steenrod squares. Let the manifold &quot;X&quot; be &quot;n&quot; dimensional. Then, for any cohomology class &quot;x&quot; of degree formula_115,

:formula_116. 

Or more narrowly, we can demand formula_117, again for cohomology classes &quot;x&quot; of degree formula_115.

==Integral Stiefel–Whitney classes==
The element formula_119 is called the &quot;i&quot; + 1 &quot;integral&quot; Stiefel–Whitney class, where β is the Bockstein homomorphism, corresponding to reduction modulo 2, Z → Z/2Z:
:formula_120

For instance, the third integral Stiefel–Whitney class is the obstruction to a Spinc structure.

===Relations over the Steenrod algebra===
Over the Steenrod algebra, the Stiefel–Whitney classes of a smooth manifold (defined as the Stiefel–Whitney classes of the tangent bundle) are generated by those of the form formula_121. In particular, the Stiefel–Whitney classes satisfy the , named for Wu Wenjun:
:formula_122

<doc id="877765" wikidata="Q707663" url="?curid=877765" title="Isidore of Kiev">
<text>Isidore or Isidor of Kiev, also known as Isidore of Thessalonica (1385 – 27 April 1463), was a prelate of Byzantine Greek origin. From 1437 to 1441, he served as the metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;, based in Moscow, after being chosen by Joseph II of Constantinople.

As a supporter of the union with Rome, he left Moscow to attend the Council of Ferrara–Florence. On his return in 1441, he was imprisoned but allowed to escape later that year. A council of Russian bishops chose their own metropolitan in 1448, which amounted to a declaration of autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church. However, Isidore continued to be recognized by Constantinople as metropolitan until 1458, when Gregory the Bulgarian was made the first metropolitan of the Uniate church.

Isidore was later dispatched to Constantinople and he proclaimed the union of the Greek and Latin churches at the Hagia Sophia on 12 December 1452. Following the fall of Constantinople, he returned to Rome. In the Latin Church, Isidore was the cardinal bishop of Sabina, Archbishop of Cyprus, Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals and the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople.

==Early life==
Early views on his birthplace suggest that he was born in Constantinople, Thessaloniki, or possibly Dalmatia. According to one version popular with modern scholars who stress his links to Constantinople, Isidore was born or possibly in Monemvasia or somewhere else in the Morea. He may have been a born into a noble family, but it is only known that he was well-connected and had the patronage of the Palaiologos dynasty.

His youth is also poorly documented, but it is likely that most of his education was at Constantinople. Based on his literary interests, Isidore received training in the scriptures, the Church Fathers, and the laws of the different dioceses and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. As a result, he would have had extensive training in ancient Greek, specifically in the Attic dialect. In Constantinople, he studied in the company of Italian humanists, including Guarino da Verona. The earliest work associated with Isidore is the funeral oration composed by Emperor Manuel II for his brother, Theodore I Palaiologos. Isidore later composed a speech commemorating the emperors Manuiel II and John VIII.

From 1420 to 1430, Isidore was in the Morea, during the time an offensive was launched by John VIII and his brothers against local Latin lords, including Carlo I Tocco. A sea engagement between the Byzantines and Tocco is known from Isidore&#x27;s &quot;Panegyric&quot;. Some historians have speculated that he was attached to the headquarters of the brothers in some capacity during this time and he returned to Constantinople shortly afterward, or that he returned with John VIII to the Constantinople in 1428. A manuscripts suggests that he did not stay in Constantinople for long and embarked on another journey to the Morea, but his ship was blown off course and reached Sicily instead.

It was the time when the Court of Constantinople, on the eve of its final destruction by the Turks, was considering the chance of rescue from the Western princes as a result of reuniting with Rome. In 1434, Isidore was sent to Basel by John VIII Palaiologos (1425–1448) as part of an embassy to open negotiations with the Council of Basel. Here he made a mellifluous speech about the splendour of the Roman Empire at Constantinople, but his efforts did not result in union of the churches.

==Metropolitan of Kiev==
===Arrival in Moscow===
In 1432, a council of Russian bishops chose Jonah, the bishop of Ryazan and Murom, to succeed Photius as metropolitan. By 1433, Jonah had already styled himself as the metropolitan designate. However, there was a delay in sending Jonah as Grand Prince Vasily II of Moscow did not regain the throne until 1434. Jonah eventually was dispatched to Constantinople at the end of 1435 or the beginning of 1436. However, by the time of his arrival, Joseph II, the patriarch of Constantinople, had already chosen Isidore as metropolitan.

According to a letter written by Jonah, it was decreed by the patriarch &quot;and the divine and holy council&quot; that &quot;when Isidor either by God’s will dies, or should anything else happen to him&quot;, then Iona was to be &quot;metropolitan in Russia&quot;. Vasily II wrote to the emperor: &quot;What shall we then do? You did not come to us in time and we appointed another to that most holy metropolitan see and we cannot now do otherwise. Isidor is already metropolitan in Russia, and you, Iona, go back to your see, the bishopric of Ryzan. And should God&#x27;s will preordain that Isidor dies, or should anything else happen to him, then you, Iona, shall be metropolitan in Russia after him.&quot; Isidore arrived in the metropolitan seat of Moscow in April 1437 and was accompanied by Jonah.

From the Byzantine point of view, Isidore was ideal based on his erudition, diplomatic skills and command of languages. Isidore&#x27;s participation in the Council of Basel in particular gave him experience in the interchange of interdoctrinal arguments. Simeon of Suzdal, who had accompanied him, wrote that &quot;the Greeks thought him to be more than all the others a great metropolitan and philosopher&quot;. When Isidore first arrived in Russia, nobody suspected him of being a supporter of the union of Rome. Vasily II was unwilling to accept Isidore at first, but this was only due to Jonah having been overlooked in Constantinople.

Russian chronicles say that Vasily II tried everything to prevent him from going to &quot;the eighth Latin Council and not to be led astray by their [i.e. the Latins&#x27;] heresy&quot;, while Jonah also claimed that &quot;however much my lord and son, Grand Prince Vasily, urged him not to go, he was unable to stop him&quot;. However, the accounts of Jonah and the chroniclers were written only after Isidore&#x27;s &quot;betrayal of Orthodoxy&quot;. It is also possible that Vasily II requested Isidore to delay his departure in order to deal with the blacklog of ecclesiastical business.

On 8 September 1437, after promising Vasily II that he would &quot;strengthen the faith and unite the Church in Orthodoxy&quot;, Isidore left Moscow with his retinue numbering one hundred. His retinue included one bishop, Avraamy of Suzdal, and a number of clerics. Avraamy also brought along the monk Simeon, who wrote his polemical &quot;Tale of the Council of Florence&quot;, as well as other scribes, one of whom was likely the anonymous author of the &quot;Journey to the Council of Florence&quot;, which was the earliest known Russian description of Western Europe. There were three staging posts in Russia: Tver, Novgorod and Pskov. Afterwards, Isidore spent eight weeks in Riga. Finally, he arrived at Ferrara on 18 August 1438. He found that the patriarch and emperor had been waiting for the Russian delegation since March, while the Western princes never came.

===Council of Florence===

On 5 July 1439, at the Council of Florence, all the Greeks headed by the emperor, except for Mark of Ephesus, signed the Decree of Union. The only Russian prelate present, Avraamy of Suzdal, signed the union, but, according to Simeon of Suzdal, this was only under duress. In his &quot;Tale of the Council of Florence&quot;, Simeon says that Avraamy &quot;did not wish [to sign], but Metropolitan Isidor arrested him and gaoled him for a whole week. Then he signed under constraint.&quot; Isidore was made cardinal and Apostolic Delegate &quot;in the Province of Lithuania, Livonia and Russia and in the states, dioceses, territories and places of &quot;Lechia&quot; [Poland] which are regarded as subject to you in your right as metropolitan&quot;.

Isidore left Florence on 6 September 1439 and his journey to Moscow took nearly twice as long as his journey to Ferrara. Simeon of Suzdal and the envoy of the prince of Tver, having fallen foul of Isidore, fled from Venice in December 1439. The envoy presumably reached Tver in early 1440, after which the news of the union would have reached Moscow. In addition, the author of the &quot;Journey to the Council of Florence&quot; left 
Isidore&#x27;s retinue in August 1440 and arrived in Russia the following month. As a result, Isidore may have been apprehensive of his reception there. From 15 September to 27 December 1439, Isidore was in Venice, before heading to Buda, where he issued an encyclical &quot;to the Polish, Lithuanian and German [i.e. Teutonic Knights&#x27;] lands and to all Orthodox Christian Russia&quot; in March 1440. After a brief stay in Poland, Isidore spent the first half of the summer in Galicia. By mid-August, he reached Vilnius and he spent the next six months in Lithuania. Following this, he visited Kiev and then Smolensk, where he took Simeon as prisoner.

===Return to Moscow===

Isidore arrived in Moscow on 19 March 1441. The chronicle says: &quot;With great pride, falsehood and Latin arrogance he [had] carried before him a Latin crucifix and a silver crozier... Should anyone not bow down before the crucifix he ordered them to be beaten with the crozier, as is done in the presence of the pope.&quot; It then says: &quot;The metropolitan entered the holy cathedral church of [the Dormition of] the Mother of God and served the holy Liturgy, commemorating in the first place Pope Eugene without mentioning the Orthodox patriarchs.&quot; The grand prince of Moscow was given a letter from the pope stating &quot;the Eastern Church is now one with us&quot; and giving much of the credit to &quot;our most holy brother Isidor, your metropolitan... of all Russia and legate from the Apostolic Throne... We ask you in piety to receive this Metropolitan Isidor for his justice and for the good of the Church...&quot;.

According to Simeon, &quot;realizing the delusion of the metropolitan&quot;, the grand prince ordered Isidore to be &quot;cast out from his spiritual rank&quot; and, &quot;for such soul-destroying heresy, to be expelled from the town of Moscow and from all his land&quot;. The chronicles say that three days later, Isidore was arrested and placed under supervision in the Chudov Monastery. The chroniclers of the grand prince wrote in their account that &quot;the princes, the boyars and many others — and especially the Russian bishops — remained silent, slumbered and fell asleep,&quot; and it was not until &quot;the divinely wise, Christ-loving sovereign, Grand Prince Vasily Vasilyevich... shamed Isidor and called him not his pastor and teacher, but a wicked and baneful wolf&quot; did &quot;all the bishops of Russia who were then in Moscow wake up, and the princes and boyars and grandees and the multitude of Christians come to their senses... and begin to call Isidor a heretic&quot;. According to John L. I. Fennell: &quot;Clearly Simeon and the chroniclers distorted facts in their depiction of Isidor&#x27;s reception in Moscow, colouring their accounts according to their prejudices.&quot; Fennell noted that between 19 March and 15 September 1441, when Isidore left Moscow, he was at some time recognized by Vasily II as the lawful metropolitan.

The &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot; and grand princely codex of 1479 both agree that on 15 September 1441, Isidor escaped with two of his disciples, Gregory and Afanasy. Isidore fled to Tver, where he was placed under house arrest by Boris of Tver, according to the chronicles of Pskov. Afterwards, he reached Novogrudok and then Rome. The grand princely codex of 1479 describes Isidore&#x27;s &quot;secret escape by night like a thief&quot; and mentions that &quot;Grand Prince Vasily Vasil&#x27;evich sent no one to bring him back, nor did he have any desire to hold him back&quot;. Vasily II wrote a letter to Patriarch Metrophanes II, which was never sent, requesting for a Russian candidate to be appointed as metropolitan. The letter mentions Isidore&#x27;s return to Moscow, calling himself &quot;Legatus a latere&quot; and carrying before him &quot;a Latin sculptured crucifix with [Christ&#x27;s] two feet nailed with one nail&quot;, but not his imprisonment or escape. It also says Isidore &quot;commemorated the pope&quot; and &quot;subjected us to the Roman Church and the Roman pope&quot;. The only action by Vasily it mentions is that he summoned a synod of six bishops, who concluded that &quot;all Isidor&#x27;s business.. is alien and different from the divine and holy canons&quot;. As a result, a decision was made to send envoys to Constantinople in order to request the appointment of a Russian metropolitan by &quot;the God-loving bishops of our fatherland&quot;. Vasily II returned to power in February 1447 following a flare-up in the civil war and Jonah was finally appointed as metropolitan on 15 December 1448 by a council of Russian bishops. In 1458, Gregory the Bulgarian was chosen by the uniate patriarch of Constantinople as the new metropolitan of Kiev, but his legitmacy was rejected in Moscow.

According to the hypothesis proposed by the Russian historian William Pokhlyobkin, it may have been Isidore who produced the first genuine recipe of Russian vodka while being detained in the Chudov Monastery. Pokhlyobin completed his &quot;Istoriya vodki&quot; (&quot;A History of Vodka&quot;) after the communist government of Poland had allegedly sued the Soviet Union for exclusive rights to the word &quot;vodka&quot;. According to Pokhlyobkin, his work was a success as a tribunal ruled in favor of the Soviets, based mostly on his research that &quot;proved&quot; that the Poles began making vodka after the Russians. However, Mark Lawrence Schrad noted that there is no evidence in the archives of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague of any such legal action by Poland. Subsequent writers have also criticized Pokhlyobkin&#x27;s work, while some Russian historians have designated the birthdate of Russian vodka as early as the 13th century.

==Later life==
Before the fall of Constantinople in 1453, he subsidized the repair of fortifications at his own expense and was wounded in the early hours of the sack. He managed to escape the carnage by dressing up a dead body in his cardinal&#x27;s robes. While the Turks were cutting off its head and parading it through the streets, the real cardinal was shipped off to Asia Minor with a number of insignificant prisoners as a slave, and later found safety in Crete. He composed a series of letters describing the events of the siege. He warned of the danger of further expansion of the Turks in the multiple letters and even seems to be the earliest eyewitness to have compared Mehmed II with Alexander the Great.

He made his way back to Rome in 1455, and was made Bishop of Sabina, presumably adopting the Latin Rite. Pope Pius II (1458–64) later gave him two titles successively, those of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople and Archbishop of Cyprus, neither of which he could convert into real jurisdiction. He was Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals from October 1461. He died on 27 April 1463.

<text>Arthur Brough (born Frederick Arthur Baker; 26 February 1905 – 28 May 1978) was a British actor, theatre founder, producer, and director. He is best known for portraying the bumbling senior menswear salesman Ernest Grainger on the BBC TV sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Brough originally aspired to become a teacher but was unable to secure employment in the field and instead worked in a solicitor&#x27;s office. Developing an interest in acting, Brough attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), graduating in 1928. He subsequently joined a Shakespearean theatrical troupe, where he met his future wife, actress Elizabeth Addyman. After marrying in 1929, they used their wedding dowry as collateral to rent the Leas Pavilion, a repertory theatre in Folkestone, Kent. The couple had one daughter, Joanna.

==Theatre impresario==
Having used the name &quot;The Pioneer Players&quot; in Folkestone since 1929, Brough and his wife, Elizabeth, formed &quot;The Arthur Brough Players&quot; in 1932. Once the Folkestone repertory company was established, Brough went on to form new repertory companies in Bradford, Bristol, Blackpool, Keighley, Leeds, Lincoln, Oxford, and Southampton, among others.

With the outbreak of World War II, Brough enlisted in the Royal Navy, where he served for the duration of the war. His service included assisting with the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, with his ship returning to the rescue scene multiple times to evacuate soldiers before the Nazis reached the seaport.

Following demobilisation, Brough resumed his acting career and reopened the Folkestone repertory theatre. Many prominent actors began their careers with &quot;The Arthur Brough Players&quot;, including Peter Barkworth, who appeared in &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot; in 1948; Eric Lander, later a star of the TV series &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, in 1949; Polly James in the early 1960s; and Anne Stallybrass, who started as an assistant stage manager in 1960 and went on to play Ida the maid in &quot;Pool&#x27;s Paradise&quot; by Philip King. She also appeared in &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot;, and &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; at the small Folkestone theatre. Other notable alumni included Andrew Jack; Sydney Sturgess, who later married Barry Morse; and Trevor Bannister, who would eventually act alongside Brough in &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;

At that time, local repertory companies would present a new play each week to compete with cinemas. A small, permanent cast would rehearse one play during the day while performing the previous week&#x27;s production each evening, with a mid-week matinee. Due to economic constraints, the limited number of actors often meant performers had to portray characters far removed from their own age or appearance.

Brough also took his company on tour and helped establish repertory companies in Aldershot, Southend, and Eastbourne.

==Television==
With the rise of television, Brough predicted the decline of repertory theatre as a viable entertainment form. In the 1960s, he began seeking roles in the mass media, appearing in small roles in both films and television. His daughter, Joanna Hutton, commented on his forecast regarding the decline of repertory theatre: &quot;He was very astute and unsentimental about it. He realized the era was over and that he must diversify.&quot; According to Hutton, her father initially struggled with the transition from stage to screen. &quot;He realized how hammy he was. He used to take the mickey out of himself; he&#x27;d always acted in a Shakespearean manner and suddenly realized he had to tone down his performance for film.&quot;

One of the first roles Brough took away from the stage was in the film &quot;The Green Man&quot; (1956) with Alastair Sim, in which he played the landlord of the eponymous hotel. He also had a minor role opposite Jayne Mansfield in &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1960), and made guest appearances in TV shows such as &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;The Persuaders&quot;, &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot;, &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, and &quot;Jason King&quot;. He also continued to appear in theatrical productions, including &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot;, where he played a shopkeeper. The Folkestone Rep continued until 1969 before closing when Brough&#x27;s wife Elizabeth began to suffer from ill health.

===&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;===
In 1972, Brough was cast as Mr. Ernest Grainger in the BBC sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft. Initially aired as a pilot episode in the &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; slot, it was well received and commissioned for a series in early 1973. Set in a fading fictional department store, Brough played the senior menswear salesman alongside his assistants Mr. Humphries (John Inman) and Mr. Lucas (Trevor Bannister). The show ran until 1985.

After the show completed its fifth series in 1977, Brough&#x27;s wife of almost 50 years, Elizabeth, died on 22 March 1978. Devastated by her passing, Brough announced he was quitting acting. He stayed with his daughter for a few weeks following his wife’s death, and according to his daughter, Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft made contact to inform him that they were writing him into the next series. However, Brough died just two months later, on 28 May 1978, in Folkestone. Croft decided not to have another actor take over the role of Mr. Grainger, so his character in &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; was replaced by Mr. Tebbs, played by James Hayter.

=== Related family life ===
Brough&#x27;s daughter, Joanna Hutton (who died in 2002), became the first female curator of the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth during the 1960s.

==Credits==
Arthur Brough dedicated his life to the theatre, and his &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; co-star Mollie Sugden credited him with helping train a generation of actors. His colleagues have fond memories of working with Brough, who, as his daughter noted, &quot;was a highly respected actor who&#x27;d spent forty years in the profession.&quot; At the time of his death, David Croft said: &quot;Arthur created a living character who was the inspiration for much of the humour. His personality made him a pivot round which a whole lot of laughter and affection revolved.&quot;

With a mischievous sense of humour, he would often pull pranks on the rest of the cast during recordings. Despite this, however, Trevor Bannister held him in very high regard, saying of him that he was a &quot;wicked old man but a wonderful man.&quot; David Croft recalls how Brough would disappear from the set: &quot;Whenever we were rehearsing, he&#x27;d vanish at about three minutes to eleven. For a while, we wondered where he went, but eventually discovered that he&#x27;d nip next door to the pub for a quick Pink Gin. We&#x27;d watch from the window as this little figure hurled towards the pub – we never spoke to him about it. One day, when he returned, John Inman asked where he&#x27;d been. He made some excuse, but what he&#x27;d forgotten was that it was pouring with rain, and his bald head was soaking wet!&quot;

In the joint venture, Saturn, an engine design and manufacturing subsidiary of UEC is responsible for the design and manufacturing of the cold section which includes the fan, the low-pressure turbine and the low-pressure compressor, as well as for the general assembly and testing of the SaM146 engine. Conversely, the area of responsibility for Safran Aircraft Engines which is represented by its subsidiary, Snecma, covers the design and manufacture of the engine core or hot-section - this includes the development of high-pressure compressor, high-pressure turbine, a combustion chamber, an accessory gearbox, electronic engine control and power plant integration. The SaM146 engine and its manufacturing process are certified to the EASA and IAC AR regulations. Deliveries and all after-sales services on the SaM146 are performed by PowerJet.

The SaM146 core design is mainly based on the CFM56. The core was developed by Snecma, drawing on its M88 ‘hot section’ military engine experience and the DEM21 core demonstrator project – with its six-stage compressor and single-stage, high-pressure turbine with active blade-tip clearance control – and various other modern design features (such as single-piece bladed disks). The SaM146 utilizes a single-stage high-pressure turbine and as a new design has been developed to meet current and projected environmental standards, including regulations of the ICAO Committee of Aviation Environmental Protection Sixth Session (CAEP VI), set to become effective in 2008.. Blisk technology is used to improve fuel economy and lower maintenance.

The SaM146 provides 62 to 77.8KN of thrust (6,200 to 7,700 kg). In April 2003, Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company selected the SaM146 for its Superjet 100 regional aircraft, to be produced in 75 and 95-seat versions. On 23 June 2010, it was announced that EASA certified PowerJet for its SaM146 engine. It gained Russian certification in August 2010.

The Sukhoi SuperJet 100 that the SaM146 powers has been marginally successful, being widely operated by several airlines: Interjet (Mexico), Aeroflot, Moskovia Airlines, Yakutia Airlines, Gazpromavia, Centre-South, UTair Aviation (Russia), Lao Central Airlines (Laos) and Sky Aviation (Indonesia).

By August 2017, the 300th Russian-French SaM146 engine for the Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SSJ100) aircraft has been assembled at UEC – Saturn (United Engine Corporation) and delivered to Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company. To date, the SaM146 engine fleet has logged over 700,000 flight hours.

In 2018 due to SaM146 problems 2 companies scrapped SSJ100 from their fleet: Red Wings and Yakutia.

In September 2018, plans were announced for the Beriev Be-200 amphibian to be re-engined with a variant of the SaM146 for international sale, replacing the Progress D-436 engines which do not have EASA or FAA type certificates.

In December 2018, the engine received 120-minute ETOPS approval from Europe’s aviation authorities.

Poor SSJ100 reliability rate occurs due to a malfunction of Sam-146 engine&#x27;s combustor after 2000–4000 hours.
 The manufacturer is said to be working on modifications to the combustor in a bid to address the issues.

Matters changed in the wake of the Russian incursion into Ukraine, since international sanctions applied to Russia prohibit sale, supply, transfer or export of aircraft and aircraft parts and technology to Russian entities. In late March 2022, PowerJet terminated its contract to provide parts, technical support, engine maintenance, or repair services with regard to the SaM146.

<doc id="877780" wikidata="Q1349257" url="?curid=877780" title="Lowell Mason">
<text>Lowell Mason (January 8, 1792 – August 11, 1872) was an American music director and banker who was a leading figure in 19th-century American church music. Lowell composed over 1,600 hymn tunes, many of which are often sung today. His best-known work includes an arrangement of &quot;Joy to the World&quot; and the tune &quot;Bethany&quot;, which sets the hymn text &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;. Mason also set music to &quot;Mary Had A Little Lamb&quot;. He is largely credited with introducing music into American public schools, and is considered the first important U.S. music educator. He has also been criticized for helping to largely eliminate the robust tradition of participatory sacred music that flourished in North America before his time.

== Life ==
Mason was born and grew up in Medfield, Massachusetts, where he became the music director of First Parish (now First Parish Unitarian Universalist) Church at age 17. His birthplace residence was saved from development in 2011. It was relocated to a town park on Green Street. The Lowell Mason House foundation is an effort to create a Lowell Mason museum and music education center.

He spent the first part of his adulthood in Savannah, Georgia, where he worked first in a dry-goods store, then in a bank. He had very strong amateur musical interests, and studied music with the German teacher Frederick L. Abel, eventually starting to write his own music. He also became a leader in the music of the Independent Presbyterian Church, where he served as choir director and organist. Under his initiative, his church created the first Sunday school for black children in America at the now Historic First Bryan Baptist Church in Savannah, GA.

Following an earlier British model, Mason embarked on producing a hymnal whose tunes would be drawn from the work of European classical composers, such as Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Mason had great difficulty in finding a publisher for this work. Ultimately, it was published (1822) by the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, which was one of the earliest American organizations devoted to classical music. Mason&#x27;s hymnal was highly successful. He first had published it anonymously, as he felt that his main career was as a banker, and he hoped not to damage his career prospects.
In 1827, Mason moved to Boston, where he continued his banking career for some time. Mason served as choirmaster and organist at Park Street Church from 1829 to 1831. He eventually became a music director for three churches, in a six-month rotation, including the Hanover Street church, whose pastor was the prominent abolitionist Lyman Beecher. 
Mason became an important figure on the Boston musical scene: He served as president of the Handel and Haydn Society, taught music in the public schools, was co-founder of the Boston Academy of Music (1833). From 1838 to 1841 served as music superintendent for the Boston school system. In the 1830s, Mason set to music the nursery rhyme &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;. In 1845 political machinations in the Boston school committee led to the termination of his services.

In 1851, at the age of 59, Mason retired from Boston musical activity and moved to New York City, where his sons, Daniel and Lowell, Jr. had established a music business. On December 20, 1851, he set sail to Europe. During his tour of Europe in 1852, he developed a great interest and enthusiasm for congregational singing, especially that of German churches, such as the Nikolaikirche in Leipzig or the Kreuzkirche in Dresden.

Following his return to New York City, Mason accepted the position as music director in 1853 for the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. It had just completed construction of a new church building on Nineteenth Street. He immediately disbanded its choir and orchestra, and installed an organ with his son, William, serving as organist. During his tenure, which lasted until 1860, he developed congregational singing to the point where the church was known as having the finest congregational singing in the city. In 1859 Mason, along with Edwards A. Parks and Austin Phelps, published the &quot;Sabbath Hymn and Tune Book&quot;. This part of his career probably had the most enduring effects on American church music. Mason personally changed his view from imagining that church congregations were reluctant to sing to vigorously promoting congregational singing. He eliminated all professional musicians save the organist.

In 1855 the University of New York awarded Mason the degree of doctor of music, which was the first musical degree awarded by any American college.

In 1860 Mason retired to his estate in Orange, New Jersey, where he helped found Valley Congregational Church (renamed Highland Avenue Congregational Church in 1916). He was buried in Orange&#x27;s Rosedale Cemetery.

==Assessment==
The editors of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; criticize Mason for his focus on European classical music as a model for Americans. On the other hand, Mason is given credit for popularizing European classical music in a region where it was seldom performed. Since his day, the United States has been part of the global region in which this form of music is cultivated and appreciated.

The New Grove editors believe that Mason&#x27;s introduction of European models for American hymnody choked off a flourishing participatory native tradition of church music, which had already produced outstanding compositions by such composers as William Billings. During the early 19th century, shape note music was used as part of evangelizing in the Second Great Awakening. Mason and his colleagues (notably his brother Timothy Mason) characterized this music as backwoods material, &quot;unscientific&quot;, and unworthy of modern Americans. They taught their views through a new form of singing school, set up to replace the old singing schools dating from colonial times.

In comparison with the earlier forms of American sacred music, the music that Mason and his colleagues propagated would be considered by many musicians to be rhythmically more homogeneous and harmonically less forceful. By emphasizing the soprano line, it also made the other choral parts less interesting to sing. Lastly, the new music generally required the support of an organ, which was a Mason family business.

James Keene also addresses the shift in church music that Mason led, putting forth the idea that to some degree Mason&#x27;s work cut off the people from their music:
As so often happens in America, the so-called arbiters of good taste looked across the Atlantic for their models and scorned that which was home-grown. And such was their influence, then as now, that an uncertain population, striving for cultural respectability, embraced the common practice of European art music. Those who studied in Europe or in the European model cultivated a social superiority. ... These arbiters of taste did not represent the mean of the population. Their influence left the many congregations without a music to which they could identify. An interest in church singing waned, giving way to the quartet choir. New England would not hear again the stimulating strains of the fuge-tune coming from all parts of the sanctuary.
The noted early music specialist Joel Cohen, whose ensemble has performed much early American music, offers the following assessment of Mason:

The tradition that Mason largely succeed in defeating retreated to the inland rural South, where it resisted efforts at conversion, surviving in the form of (for example) &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; music. This genre has grown in popularity as Americans (and even Europeans ) in all regions rediscover pre-Lowell Mason American sacred music.

Nevertheless, his achievements as a hymnodist were celebrated long after his death. In 1942, his sesquicentennial was well celebrated. After an unveiling of a plaque at his grave, a commemorative service at the Orange church he founded was held. In addition to a variety of choral performances (of Mason&#x27;s music), the service featured organ preludes based on Mason hymn tunes specially written for the occasion by T. Tertius Noble and by Mason&#x27;s grandson Daniel Gregory Mason. Later that evening another concert featuring Mason&#x27;s music was held at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.

==Relatives==
Lowell Mason was the father of Henry Mason (the founder of the Mason and Hamlin firm), as well as composer William Mason. He was the grandfather of Daniel Gregory Mason, a music critic and composer and John B. Mason, a popular late nineteenth and early twentieth-century stage actor. Lowell&#x27;s twin brother Johnson Mason was the grandfather of Louisville, Kentucky architect Mason Maury.

<doc id="877783" wikidata="Q1287856" url="?curid=877783" title="James Hayter (actor)">
<text>Henry James Hayter (23 April 1907 – 27 March 1983) was a British actor of television and film. He is best remembered for his roles as Friar Tuck in the film &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952) and as Samuel Pickwick in the film &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1952), the latter earning him a BAFTA Award for Best British Actor nomination.

==Early life ==
Hayter was born in Lonavala, India, and brought up in Scotland, attending Dollar Academy. He made his West End debut in the 1936 comedy &quot;The Composite Man&quot; at Daly&#x27;s Theatre. His best remembered film roles include Friar Tuck in the 1952 film &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (he reprised the same role in the 1967 film &quot;A Challenge for Robin Hood&quot;) and Samuel Pickwick in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; of the same year. His rotund appearance and fruity voice made him a natural choice for such roles.

==Acting career ==
As an actor, Hayter became a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His film career began in 1936 in &quot;Sensation&quot;, but was interrupted by World War II, during which he served in the Royal Armoured Corps. His 1946 television series &quot;Pinwright&#x27;s Progress&quot;, shown on the BBC, is recognised as the first real example of the half-hour situation comedy format in the history of British television.

In the 1968 film &quot;Oliver!&quot;, Hayter played Mr Jessop, the bookshop owner. He appeared in scenes when Dodger steals a gentleman&#x27;s wallet outside the bookshop and also when Oliver is in court charged with the robbery. Hayter was the Ministry doorman in the film &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949).

His later career included roles in TV series such as &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;. In 1967, Hayter appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; episode &quot;A Funny Thing Happened On The Way to the Station&quot; as the ticket master. He also appeared as Dickson McCunn in the BBC serial &quot;Huntingtower&quot;, based on the book by John Buchan.

Hayter also appeared in the long-running BBC department store sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; as the senior salesman Mr Tebbs in 1978. He was the original narrator of the UK television advertisements for Mr Kipling cakes. These adverts actually led to his departure from &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;; the cake company paid him a significant bonus to withdraw from the series, as they felt his reputation lent an air of dignity to their advertisements. &quot;Who can blame an actor in his seventies for accepting money for staying at home? I, now 78, would jump at the chance!&quot; wrote Frank Thornton (Captain Peacock in the series) in a letter to one of Hayter&#x27;s eight children in 1999.

==Personal life and death==
He died in Spain in 1983, aged 75.

<text>RAF Brampton was a non-flying Royal Air Force installation near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, England. Formerly the home of RAF Support Command, it also became the home of several elements of Defence Equipment &amp; Support (DE&amp;S), which itself was a result of a merger between the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) and the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA), and provided a base for the Defence Security &amp; Assurance Services and Defence Estates.

It was part of the combined station RAF Brampton Wyton Henlow but this was disbanded on 2 April 2012 and the station was renamed Brampton Camp, losing its status as a RAF station and coming under the control of Joint Forces Command and RAF Wyton. The camp was closed at the end of 2013 and all assets were transferred to a new JFIG Pathfinder building at RAF Wyton.

== History ==
The site was used during the First World War, when Lord Mandeville (who owned the site) agreed to its use to house German prisoners of war. After this, Lord Mandeville let the site for domestic use. During the early years of the Second World War, the site was used to house babies and children evacuated from London. In 1942, the United States Army Air Force First Bomb Wing Headquarters was established on the site and it was used to billet American airmen. In September 1945, the USAAF moved out to what was RAF Alconbury, to the north of the Brampton site.

The Royal Air Force Technical Training Command billeted staff at RAF Brampton (then known as Brampton Park) whilst the Command HQ was located at Brampton Grange, a large house that dates back to 1773. In 1955, Brampton Park became RAF Brampton and units began to be located there rather than just personnel. Units included the Central Reconnaissance Establishment, which was formed at Brampton in January 1957.

In 1953, JARIC (UK) was established and it moved, in 1956, with other elements to the recently formed RAF Brampton. JARIC stayed at Brampton for 57 years with various name changes before departing RAF Brampton for RAF Wyton in 2013.

In 1955, RAF Wyton was granted the Freedom of the Borough of Huntingdon and 40 years later, this privilege was extended to the staff at RAF Brampton.

Between 1976 and 1979 the station had two gate guardian aircraft - a Gnat (tail number XR571) and a Jet Provost (tail number XN602), representing the presence on the base of RAF Support Command. After they were removed, the base had no gate guardian until Phantom XT914 was installed in 1997.

In June 1977, the Support and Training Commands were unified to form RAF Support Command at Brampton. Support command occupied a large building in the centre of the base that caught fire in October 1985. Staff were moved to empty families&#x27; quarters on the base and contingencies were implemented; when Air Marshal Sir John Sutton was appointed Commander in January 1986, he was faced with a burnt out HQ which would eventually cost £10 million to fix. On 1 April 1994, Support Command was combined with Personnel and Logistics staff to form Personnel and Training Command (at RAF Innsworth) and RAF Logistics Command at RAF Brampton.

Originally, RAF Brampton, RAF Wyton and RAF Henlow were separate stations. However, in the mid-1990s, with the closure of RAF Logistics Command then at Brampton, and the cessation of operational flying from Wyton, the two stations amalgamated to become Brampton Wyton. Henlow joined the group in 2001, and brought with it RAF Stanbridge, to produce the largest station in terms of both geography and number of personnel in the RAF. The station stretches from Brampton and Wyton, around apart, in the north, southwards around to Henlow, and then westwards some (towards Leighton Buzzard) to Stanbridge.

However, in 2009, an MoD review decided that Brampton was surplus to requirements because a new intelligence centre (DIFC) would be built at nearby RAF Wyton. The tri-station amalgamation was disbanded on 2 April 2012 and RAF Brampton was renamed Brampton Camp, losing its status as a RAF station and coming under the control of Joint Forces Command and RAF Wyton.

== Closure ==
In March 2012, the gate guardian – a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II aircraft with tail number XT914 – was removed from RAF Brampton and transported to Wattisham airfield in Suffolk. The Phantom had previously flown in two of the squadrons based at what was RAF Wattisham (No. 56 Squadron RAF and No. 74 Squadron RAF) in the 1980s and 90s. It had been a gate guardian at RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire until 1997 when it was moved to Brampton.

The station closed at the end of 2013 with large scale demolition of the buildings taking place in 2016 and into 2017. The site is being cleared to make way for housing but some of the buildings and trees on the site are protected. There are plans for between 400 and 500 homes on the site. Military housing was kept on the site for a further three years with a gradual rundown until all staff were transferred to RAF Wyton. The 95 homes left at Brampton were then bought up by a company who rent them out. Controversially, the Brampton Park Little Theatre on the base was approved for demolition in 2014. The building had been used as a cinema since the 1950s and had also been available for public use despite being on a military base. Support to keep the theatre had come from Joanna Lumley and Ian McKellen, but along with other non-listed buildings on the base, it was demolished.

== Airfield ==
Brampton never had an airfield, although Wyton and Henlow used to. RAF Wyton was used by No. 57 Squadron RAF, Cambridge and London University Air Squadrons and 5 AEF flying the Grob Tutor, before they were transferred to RAF Wittering in 2014 apart from No. 57 squadron which was transferred to RAF Cranwell. RAF Henlow is used by 616 Volunteer Gliding Squadron flying the Grob Vigilant and leased out as a general aviation airfield.

==Operational units==
* Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC) – became part of DGIFC (later DIFC)
* Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S)
* Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) – became part of DE&amp;S
* Defence Security &amp; Assurance Services

The station was for many years home to JARIC – The National Imagery Exploitation Centre, which produced intelligence from all forms of imagery, and trained Service personnel to provide intelligence in support of operations. This was moved to RAF Wyton in September 2013 under the Defence Intelligence Fusion Centre (DIFC).

<text>Azerbaijani literature (, ) is written in Azerbaijani, a Turkic language, which is the official state language of the Republic of Azerbaijan, where the North Azerbaijani variety is spoken. It is also natively spoken in Iran, where the South Azerbaijani variety is used, and is particularly spoken in the northwestern historic region of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani is also spoken natively in Russia (especially Dagestan), Georgia and Turkey. While the majority of Azerbaijani people live in Iran, modern Azerbaijani literature is overwhelmingly produced in the Republic of Azerbaijan, where the language has official status. Three scripts are used for writing the language: Azerbaijani Latin script in the Republic of Azerbaijan, Arabic script in Iran and Cyrillic script formerly used in Soviet Azerbaijan. 

The earliest development of Azerbaijani literature is closely associated with Anatolian Turkish, written in Perso-Arabic script. Examples of its detachment date to the 14th century or earlier. Several major authors helped to develop Azerbaijani literature from the 14th century until the 17th century and poetry figures prominently in their works. Towards the end of the 19th century, popular literature such as newspapers began to be published in Azerbaijani language. The production of written works in Azerbaijani was banned in Soviet Azerbaijan Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Red Terror&quot; campaign targeted thousands of Azerbaijani writers, journalists, teachers, intellectuals and others and resulted in the changing of the Azerbaijani alphabet into one with a Cyrillic alphabet.
Modern Azerbaijani literature is almost exclusively produced in the Republic of Azerbaijan and despite being widely spoken in Iran, Azerbaijani is not formally taught in schools nor are publications in Azerbaijani easily available.

==The two traditions of Azerbaijani literature==

Throughout most of its history, Azerbaijani literature has been rather sharply divided into two rather different traditions, neither of which exercised much influence upon the other until the 19th century. The first of these two traditions is Azerbaijani folk literature, and the second is Azerbaijani written literature.

For most of the history of Azerbaijani literature, the salient difference between the folk and the written traditions has been the variety of language employed. The folk tradition, by and large, was oral and remained free of the influence of Persian and Arabic literature, and consequently of those literatures&#x27; respective languages. In folk poetry—which is by far the tradition&#x27;s dominant genre—this basic fact led to two major consequences in terms of poetic style:
* the poetic meters employed in the folk poetic tradition were different, being quantitative (i.e., syllabic) verse, as opposed to the qualitative verse employed in the written poetic tradition;
* the basic structural unit of folk poetry became the quatrain (Azerbaijani: &quot;dördmisralı&quot;) rather than the couplets (Azerbaijani: &quot;beyt&quot;) more commonly employed in written poetry.

Furthermore, Azerbaijani folk poetry has always had an intimate connection with song—most of the poetry was, in fact, expressly composed so as to be sung—and so became to a great extent inseparable from the tradition of Azerbaijani folk music.
In contrast to the tradition of Azerbaijani folk literature tended to embrace the influence of Persian and Arabic literature. To some extent, this can be seen as far back as the Seljuk period in the late 11th to early 14th centuries, where official business was conducted in the Persian language, rather than in Turkic, and where a court poet such as Dehhanî—who served under the 13th century sultan Ala ad-Din Kay Qubadh I—wrote in a language highly inflected with Persian.

With the founding of Safavid Iran in the 16th century, it continued this tradition. The standard poetic forms—for poetry was as much the dominant genre in the written tradition as in the folk tradition—were derived either directly from the Persian literary tradition (the &quot;qəzəl&quot; غزل; the &quot;məsnəvi&quot; مثنوی), or indirectly through Persian from the Arabic (the &quot;qəsidə&quot; قصيده). However, the decision to adopt these poetic forms wholesale led to two important further consequences:
the poetic meters (Azerbaijani: &quot;aruz&quot;) of Persian poetry were adopted;

* Persian- and Arabic-based words were brought into the Azerbaijani language in great numbers, as Turkic words rarely worked well within the system of Persian poetic meter. This style of writing under Persian and Arabic influence came to be known as &quot;Divan literature&quot; (Azerbaijani: &quot;divan ədəbiyyatı&quot;), &quot;dîvân&quot; (ديوان) being a Persian originated Azerbaijani word referring to the collected works of a poet.

==Azerbaijani folk literature==

Azerbaijani folk literature is an oral tradition deeply rooted, in its form, in Central Asian nomadic traditions. However, in its themes, Azerbaijani folk literature reflects the problems peculiar to a settling (or settled) people who have abandoned the nomadic lifestyle.One example of this is the series of folktales surrounding the figure of Keloğlan, a young boy beset with the difficulties of finding a wife, helping his mother to keep the family house intact, and dealing with the problems caused by his neighbors. Another example is the rather mysterious figure of Nasreddin, a trickster who often plays jokes, of a sort, on his neighbors. 

Because the Azerbaijani folk literature tradition extends in a more or less unbroken line from about the 13–15th century to today, it is perhaps best to consider the tradition from the perspective of genre. There are three basic genres in the tradition: epic; folk poetry; and folklore.

===The epic tradition===
The Turkic epic has its roots in the Central Asian epic tradition that gave rise to the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut.&quot;; written in Azerbaijani language. The form developed from the oral traditions of the Oghuz Turks influenced Azeri literature. Turkic epics like Alpamysh are popular among Azerbaijanis.

The &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; was the primary element of the Azerbaijani epic tradition in the Caucasus and Anatolia for several centuries: 11th–12th centuries.
Concurrent to the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; was the so-called Turkic &quot;Epic of Köroğlu&quot;, which concerns the adventures of Rüşen Ali (&quot;Köroğlu&quot;, or &quot;son of the blind man&quot;) as he exacted revenge for the blinding of his father. The origins of this epic are somewhat more mysterious than those of the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;: many believe it to have arisen in sometime between the 15th and 17th centuries; more reliable testimony, though, seems to indicate that the story is nearly as old as that of the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;, dating from around the dawn of the 11th century. Complicating matters somewhat is the fact that Köroğlu is also the name of a poet of the &quot;aşıq&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition.

===Folk poetry===

The folk poetry tradition in Azerbaijani literature, as indicated above, was strongly influenced by the Islamic Sufi and Shia traditions. Furthermore, as partly evidenced by the prevalence of the still existent &quot;aşıq&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, the dominant element in Turkic folk poetry has always been song. The development of folk poetry in Turkic —which began to emerge in the 13th century with such important writers as Yunus Emre, Sultan Veled, and Şeyyâd Hamza—was given a great boost when, on 13 May 1277, Karamanoğlu Mehmet Bey declared Turkic the official state language of Anatolia&#x27;s powerful Karamanid state; subsequently, many of the tradition&#x27;s greatest poets would continue to emerge from this region. 

There are, broadly speaking, two traditions of Azerbaijani folk poetry:
* the &quot;aşıq&quot; tradition, which—although much influenced by religion, as mentioned above—was for the most part a secular tradition;
* the explicitly religious tradition, which emerged from the gathering places (&quot;təkyə&quot;s) of the Sufi religious orders and Shia groups.

Much of the poetry and song of the &quot;aşıq&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, being almost exclusively oral until the 19th century, remains anonymous. There are, however, a few well-known &quot;aşıq&quot;s from before that time whose names have survived together with their works: the aforementioned Köroğlu (16th century); Karacaoğlan (1606–1689), who may be the best-known of the pre-19th century &quot;aşıq&quot;s; Dadaloğlu (1785–1868), who was one of the last of the great &quot;aşıq&quot;s before the tradition began to dwindle somewhat in the late 19th century; and several others. The &quot;aşıq&quot;s were essentially minstrels who travelled through Anatolia performing their songs on the &quot;bağlama&quot;, a mandolin-like instrument whose paired strings are considered to have a symbolic religious significance in Alevi/Bektashi culture. Despite the decline of the &quot;aşıq&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition in the 19th century, it experienced a significant revival in the 20th century thanks to such outstanding figures as Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu (1894–1973), Aşık Mahzuni Şerif (1938–2002), Neşet Ertaş (1938–2012), and many others.

The explicitly religious folk tradition of &quot;təkyə&quot; literature shared a similar basis with the &quot;aşıq&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition in that the poems were generally intended to be sung, generally in religious gatherings, making them somewhat akin to Western hymns (Azerbaijani &quot;ilahi&quot;). One major difference from the &quot;aşıq&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, however, is that—from the very beginning—the poems of the &quot;təkyə&quot; tradition were written down. This was because they were produced by revered religious figures in the literate environment of the &quot;təkyə&quot;, as opposed to the milieu of the &quot;aşıq&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, where the majority could not read or write.

The major figures in the tradition of &quot;təkyə&quot; literature are: Yunus Emre (1238–1321), who is one of the most important figures in all of Turkish literature; Süleyman Çelebi, who wrote a highly popular long poem called &quot;Vesîletü&#x27;n-Necât&quot; (وسيلة النجاة &quot;The Means of Salvation&quot;, but more commonly known as the &quot;Mevlid&quot;), concerning the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; Kaygusuz Abdal, who is widely considered the founder of Alevi/Bektashi literature; and Pir Sultan Abdal, whom many consider to be the pinnacle of that literature.

==Safavid literature==

The two primary streams of Safavid written literature are poetry and prose. Of the two, poetry—specifically, Divan poetry—was by far the dominant stream. Moreover, until the 19th century, Safavid prose did not contain any examples of fiction; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European romance, short story, or novel (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in Divan poetry).

===Divan poetry===

Divan poetry was a ritualized and symbolic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير &quot;müraat-i nəzir&quot; / تناسب &quot;tənasüb&quot;) and opposition (تضاد &quot;təzad&quot;)—were more or less prescribed. Examples of prevalent symbols that, to some extent, oppose one another include, among others:
* the nightingale (بلبل &quot;bülbül&quot;) — the rose (ﮔل &quot;gül&quot;)
* the world (جهان &quot;cəhan&quot;; عالم &quot;aləm&quot;) — the rosegarden (ﮔﻠﺴﺘﺎن &quot;gülüstan&quot;; ﮔﻠﺸﻦ &quot;gülşən&quot;)
* the ascetic (زاهد &quot;zahid&quot;) — the dervish (درويش &quot;dərviş&quot;)

As the opposition of &quot;the ascetic&quot; and &quot;the dervish&quot; suggests that divan poetry, much like Azerbaijani folk poetry, was heavily influenced by Shia Islam. One of the primary characteristics of divan poetry. However, as of the Persian poetry before it—was its mingling of the mystical Sufi element with a profane and even erotic element. Thus, the pairing of &quot;the nightingale&quot; and &quot;the rose&quot; simultaneously suggests two different relationships:
* the relationship between the fervent lover (&quot;the nightingale&quot;) and the inconstant beloved (&quot;the rose&quot;)
* the relationship between the individual Sufi practitioner (who is often characterized in Sufism as a lover) and God (who is considered the ultimate source and object of love)

Similarly, &quot;the world&quot; refers simultaneously to the physical world and to this physical world considered as the abode of sorrow and impermanence, while &quot;the rosegarden&quot; refers simultaneously to a literal garden and to the garden of Paradise. &quot;The nightingale&quot;, or suffering lover, is often seen as situated—both literally and figuratively—in &quot;the world&quot;, while &quot;the rose&quot;, or beloved, is seen as being in &quot;the rose-garden&quot;.

Ottoman and Safavid divan poetry heavily influenced each other. As for the development of Divan poetry over the more than 500 years of its existence, that is—as the Ottomanist Walter G. Andrews points out—a study still in its infancy; clearly defined movements and periods have not yet been decided upon. Early in the history of the tradition, the Persian influence was very strong, but this was mitigated somewhat through the influence of poets such as the Azerbaijani Nəsimi (1369–1417) and the Uzbek/Uyghur Əli Şir Nəvai (1441–1501), both of whom offered strong arguments for the poetic status of the Turkic languages as against the much-venerated Persian. Partly as a result of such arguments, Divan poetry in its strongest period—from the 16th to the 18th centuries—came to display a unique balance of Persian and Turkic elements, until the Persian influence began to predominate again in the early 19th century.

Azerbaijani poets although they had been inspired and influenced by classical Persian poetry, it would be a superficial judgment to consider the former as blind imitators of the latter, as is often done. A limited vocabulary and common technique, and the same world of imagery and subject matter based mainly on Islamic sources were shared by all poets of Islamic literature.

Despite the lack of certainty regarding the stylistic movements and periods of Divan poetry, however, certain highly different styles are clear enough, and can perhaps be seen as exemplified by certain poets:

* Füzuli (1494–1556); a unique poet who wrote with equal skill in Azerbaijani, Persian, and Arabic, and who came to be as influential in Persian as in Divan poetry
* Bâkî (1526–1600); a poet of great rhetorical power and linguistic subtlety whose skill in using the pre-established tropes of the Divan tradition is quite representative of the poetry in the time of Süleyman the Magnificent
* Nef‘î (1572–1635); a poet considered the master of the &quot;kasîde&quot; (a kind of panegyric), as well as being known for his harshly satirical poems, which led to his execution
* Nâbî (1642–1712); a poet who wrote a number of socially oriented poems critical of the stagnation period of Ottoman history
* Nedîm (1681–1730); a revolutionary poet of the Tulip Era of Ottoman history, who infused the rather élite and abstruse language of Divan poetry with numerous simpler, populist elements
* Şeyh Gâlib (1757–1799); a poet of the Mevlevî Sufi order whose work is considered the culmination of the highly complex so-called &quot;Indian style&quot; (سبك هندى &quot;sebk-i hindî&quot;)

The vast majority of divan poetry was lyric in nature: either &quot;qəzəl&quot;s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or &quot;qəsidə&quot;s. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the &quot;məsnəvi&quot;, a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry; the two most notable examples of this form are the &quot;Leyli və Məcnun&quot; (ليلى و مجنون) of Füzuli and the &quot;Hüsn ü eşq&quot; (حسن و عشق; &quot;Beauty and Love&quot;) of Şeyx Qalib.

===Early Safavid prose===
Until the 19th century, Safavid prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of &quot;səc&quot;&#x27; (سجع, also transliterated as &quot;səci&quot;), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the Arabic &quot;saj&#x27;&quot; and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a rhyme.

Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time. This tradition was exclusively nonfictional in nature—the fiction tradition was limited to narrative poetry. A number of such nonfictional prose genres developed:
* the &quot;târih&quot; (تاريخ), or history, a tradition in which there are many notable writers, including the 15th-century historian Aşıkpaşazâde and the 17th-century historians Kâtib Çelebi and Naîmâ
* the &quot;seyâhatnâme&quot; (سياحت نامه), or travelogue, of which the outstanding example is the 17th-century &quot;Seyahâtnâme&quot; of Evliya Çelebi
* the &quot;sefâretnâme&quot; (سفارت نامه), a related genre specific to the journeys and experiences of an Ottoman ambassador, and which is best exemplified by the 1718–1720 &quot;Paris Sefâretnâmesi&quot; of Yirmisekiz Mehmed Çelebi, ambassador to the court of Louis XV of France
* the &quot;siyâsetnâme&quot; (سياست نامه), a kind of political treatise describing the functionings of state and offering advice for rulers, an early Seljuk example of which is the 11th-century &quot;Siyāsatnāma&quot;, written in Persian by Nizam al-Mulk, vizier to the Seljuk rulers Alp Arslan and Malik Shah I
* the &quot;tezkîre&quot; (تذکره), a collection of short biographies of notable figures, some of the most notable of which were the 16th-century &quot;tezkiretü&#x27;ş-şuarâ&quot;s (تذكرة الشعرا), or biographies of poets, by Latîfî and Aşık Çelebi
* the &quot;münşeât&quot; (منشآت), a collection of writings and letters similar to the Western tradition of &quot;belles-lettres&quot;
* the &quot;münâzara&quot; (مناظره), a collection of debates of either a religious or a philosophical nature

==Classical era==
The earliest known figure in Azerbaijani literature is Izzeddin Hasanoghlu, who composed a diwan of Azerbaijani and Persian ghazals. In Persian ghazals he used the pen-name &quot;Pur-e Hasan&quot;, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of Hasanoghlu.

In the 15th century, Azerbaijan was under the control of Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu Turkic tribal confederacies. Among the poets of this period were Kadi Burhan al-Din, Haqiqi (pen-name of Jahan-shah Qara Qoyunlu), Habibi, and Kishvari. The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of Imadaddin Nasimi, one of the greatest Azerbaijani Hurufi mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries
The book Dede Qorqud which consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century, was not written earlier than the 15th century. It is a collection of twelve stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads. Since the author is buttering up both the Aq Qoyunlu and Ottoman rulers, it has been suggested that the composition belongs to someone living between the Aq Qoyunlu and Ottoman Empire. Geoffery Lewis believes an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pechenegs and the Kipchaks), however this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Aq Qoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trabzon.

The 16th-century poet, Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical &quot;Qazals&quot; in Arabic, Persian, and Azerbaijani. Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include &quot;The Divan of Ghazals&quot; and &quot;The Qasidas&quot;.

In the 16th century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of Ashik () poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī ( for &quot;sinner&quot;) Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani, which were later published as his &quot;Divan&quot;. A unique literary style known as &quot;qoshma&quot; ( for &quot;improvisation&quot;) was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah Tahmasp I.

In the span of the 17th century and 18th century, Fizuli&#x27;s unique genres as well Ashik poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as Qovsi of Tabriz, Shah Abbas Sani, Agha Mesih Shirvani, Nishat, Molla Vali Vidadi, Molla Panah Vagif, Amani, Zafar and others.

Along with Anatolian Turks, Turkmens and Uzbeks, Azerbaijanis also celebrate the epic of Koroglu (from for &quot;blind man&#x27;s son&quot;), a legendary hero or a &quot;noble bandit&quot; of the Robin Hood type. Several documented versions of Koroglu epic remain at the Institute for Manuscripts of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.

==The nineteenth century onward==

Azerbaijani literature of the nineteenth century was profoundly influenced by the Russian conquest of the territory of present-day Republic of Azerbaijan, as a result of Russo-Persian Wars, which separated the territory of nowadays Azerbaijan, from Iran. Azerbaijani-Turkish writer Ali bey Huseynzade&#x27;s poem &quot;Turan&quot; inspired Turanism and pan-Turkism among Turkish intellectuals during the First World War and early Republican period. Hüseynzade emphasized the linguistic bonds between the Turks, who were Muslim, and the Christian people of Hungary.

The fascination with language is seen in the work of Mirzə Cəlil Məmmədquluzadə who was an influential figure in the development of Azerbaijani nationalism in Soviet Azerbaijan. Məmmədqulzadə, who was also the founder of the satirical journal &quot;Molla Nasraddin&quot;, wrote the play &quot;Anamın kitabı&quot; (My Mother&#x27;s Book) in 1920 in Karabakh. It was about a wealthy widow who lived with her three sons who had graduated from universities in St. Petersburg, Istanbul and Najaf. The brothers had adapted to the culture and languages of the cities in which they were educated and were not able to understand one another or their mother. Their sister, Gülbahar, only able to read in Muslim language (&quot;müsəlmanca savadlı&quot;), burns her brothers&#x27; books at the end. After the Russian vocabularies, Ottoman poems, and Persian astronomy books are destroyed, the only book that survives Gülbahar&#x27;s &quot;cultural revolution&quot; is a notebook, written in Azerbaijani language, containing wishes for the unity of the family.

===Soviet Azerbaijani literature===
Under the Soviet rule, particularly during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s reign, Azerbaijani writers who did not conform to the party line were persecuted. Bolsheviks sought to destroy the nationalist intellectual elite established during the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and in the 1930s, many writers and intellectuals were essentially turned into mouthpieces of Soviet propaganda.

Although there were those who did not follow to the official party line in their writings. Among them were Mahammad Hadi, Abbas Sahhat, Huseyn Javid, Abdulla Shaig, Jafar Jabbarly, and Mikayil Mushfig, who in their search for a means of resistance, turned to the clandestine methodologies of Sufism, which taught spiritual discipline as a way to combat temptation.

When Nikita Khrushchev came to power in 1953 following Stalin&#x27;s death, the harsh focus on propaganda began to fade, and writers began to branch off in new directions, primarily focused on uplifting prose that would be a source of hope to Azerbaijanis living under a totalitarian regime.

===Iranian Azerbaijani literature===
An influential piece of post-World War II Azerbaijani poetry, &quot;Heydar Babaya Salam&quot; (Greetings to Heydar Baba) is considered to be a pinnacle in Azerbaijani literature was written by Iranian Azerbaijani poet Mohammad Hossein Shahriar. This poem, published in Tabriz in 1954 and written in colloquial Azerbaijani, became popular among Azerbaijanis in Iran&#x27;s northwestern historic region of Azerbaijan and Republic of Azerbaijan. In &quot;Heydar Babaya Salam&quot;, Shahriar expressed his Azerbaijani identity attached to his homeland, language, and culture. Heydar Baba is a hill near Khoshknab, the native village of the poet.

== Modern literature ==
From writers of modern Azerbaijan, the most famous were the screenwriter Rustam Ibragimbekov and the author of the detective novels Chingiz Abdullayev, who wrote exclusively in Russian.

Poetry is represented by famous poets Nariman Hasanzade, Khalil Rza, Sabir Novruz, Vagif Samadoghlu, Nusrat Kesemenli, Ramiz Rovshan, Hamlet Isakhanli, Zalimkhan Yagub, etc. Among modern Azerbaijani playwrights, F. Goja, Elchin, K. Abdullah, A. Masud, G. Miralamov, E. Huseynbeyli, A. Ragimov, R. Akber, A. Amirley, and others.

The framework of the new Azerbaijani prose is expanded by elements of the detective, fiction, anti-utopia, Turkic mythology, eastern surrealism. Among the writers working in this genre one can name such writers as Anar, M. Suleymanly, N. Rasulzade, R. Rahmanoglu. The new Azerbaijani realism began to gain momentum when young prose writers began to turn increasingly to national history and ethnic memory. In this regard, it is worth noting the historical and synthetic novel &quot;The Thirteenth Apostle, or One Hundred Forty-First Don Juan&quot; by Elchin Huseynbeyli and the historical novels &quot;Shah Abbas&quot; and &quot;Nadir Shah&quot; by Yunus Oguz.

After gaining independence in Azerbaijan, an important role was played by the liberation of the occupied territories, love of the Motherland and justice. One of the most famous books about Karabakh are: &quot;Karabakh – mountains call us&quot; Elbrus Orujev, &quot;Azerbaijan Diary: A Rogue Reporter&#x27;s Adventures in an Oil-Rich, War-Torn, Post-Soviet Republic&quot; Thomas Goltz &quot;History of Azerbaijan on documents and Ziya Bunyatov. The Karabakh war left its misprint in the modern Azerbaijani literature: such writers as G. Anargizy, M. Suleymanly, A. Rahimov, S. Ahmedli, V. Babally, K. Nezirli, A. Kuliev, A. Abbas, M. Bekirli turned to the themes of the fate of refugees, longing for the lost Shusha, Khojaly massacre, cruelty of war, etc.

To support young writers in 2009, the &quot;Ali and Nino&quot; publishing house established the National Book Award of Azerbaijan, which annually monitors novelties of literature, and gives awards to the most successful samples of literature and works released over the past year. The jury of the award includes well-known Azerbaijani writers, cultural figures.

<text>Dodging and burning are techniques used during the printing process to manipulate the exposure of select areas on a photographic print, deviating from the rest of the image&#x27;s exposure. In a darkroom print from a film negative, &quot;dodging&quot; decreases the exposure for areas of the print that the photographer wishes to be lighter, while &quot;burning&quot; increases the exposure to areas of the print that should be darker.

Any material with varying degrees of opacity may be used, as preferred, to cover or obscure the desired area for burning or dodging. One may use a transparency with text, designs, patterns, a stencil, or a completely opaque material shaped according to the desired area of burning/dodging.

Many modern digital image editing programs have &quot;dodge&quot; and &quot;burn&quot; tools that mimic the effect on digital images.

==Applications==
A key application of dodging and burning is to improve contrast (tonal reproduction) in film print-making; today this is better known as tone mapping in digital photography – see high-dynamic-range imaging. The technical issue is that natural scenes have higher dynamic range (ratio of light to dark) than can be captured by film, which in turn is greater than can be reproduced in prints. Compressing this high dynamic range into a print either requires uniformly decreasing contrast (making tones closer together) or carefully printing different parts of an image differently so that each retains the maximum contrast – in this latter dodging and burning is a key tool.

An excellent example is the photograph &quot;Schweitzer with lamp at his desk&quot; by W. Eugene Smith, from his 1954 photo essay &quot;A Man of Mercy&quot; on Dr. Albert Schweitzer and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to produce, in order to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to dark shadow.

Ansel Adams elevated dodging and burning to an art form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two techniques. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called &quot;The Print&quot;, which features dodging and burning prominently, in the context of his Zone System.

They can also be used in less subtle ways, as in the stenciled lettering shown at the top of this article.

==Technique==

By using completely opaque material as a cover over the preferred area for dodging or burning, absolutely no light will pass through and as a result, an outline of the material may be visible on the print. One way to prevent obvious cover-up lines is to slightly shake the burning material over the covered area while it is being exposed. Another way to prevent obvious cover-up lines is to use slightly less opaque material closer to the outline to produce a more subtle, faded effect.

===Burning===

To burn-in a print, the print is first given normal exposure. Next, extra exposure is given to the area or areas that need to be darkened. A card or other opaque object is held between the enlarger lens and the photographic paper in such a way as to allow light to fall only on the portion of the scene to be darkened.

===Dodging===

A card or other opaque object is held between the enlarger lens and the photographic paper in such a way as to block light from the portion of the scene to be lightened. Since the technique is used with a negative-to-positive process, reducing the amount of light results in a lighter image.

<text>Chingford railway station is the terminus of the Chingford branch of the Lea Valley Lines, located in Chingford in the London Borough of Waltham Forest. It is one of three northern termini of London Overground&#x27;s Weaver line, down the line from London Liverpool Street. The station is in Travelcard Zone 5, and is situated close to Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge.

Its three-letter station code is CHI.

== History ==
The Eastern Counties Railway had begun its venture into a main line railway that would head north to compete with the Great Northern. Limited funds and incessant squabbling had slowed its progress.
After the merger with several other lines, the ECR became part of the Great Eastern Railway. The GER planned a network of lines to serve countryside around London by its Metropolitan Station and Railways Act of 1864. It also planned a line to High Beach, to serve Epping Forest, which reached a terminus in Bull Lane (now Kings Road) at the very end of Hale End Road (now Larkshall Road) in Chingford, in 1873. In 1878 the small station (named &#x27;Chingford Green&#x27;) near to the village green was replaced by a much more grandiose station on the very edge of town, overlooking the forest. The extension of the railway by only to a place far less useful to the local population was an attempt to trap tourist traffic to the forest, and to stimulate suburban growth in the fields surrounding it. The line was doubled and the new station built as a through station, with its platforms and tracks leading out onto an embankment ready to leap across the newly named Station Road and enter the forest.

The railway fostered new interest in the forest as a destination and the popularity of this Crown land and its impending loss to development was not unnoticed. In 1882 Queen Victoria came by train to Chingford and declared the forest open to the public forever. The railway that had encouraged so much interest and carried the Royal party to the very edge of town was now stumped as any new development on the forest lands would be strictly controlled. However, the Chingford Rise Estate company developed land to the south with large villas, some of which now sell for over £1 million.

Chingford became a commuter terminal and was eventually truncated to make way for a bus station. The line no longer towers over the forest, but hides quietly behind the bustle of Station Road, its electric trains now transporting workers into the city rather than helping the masses to escape it.

The station building is relatively unchanged since its 1878 construction, and still carries the grandeur that accompanied the railway schemes of the late 19th century.

The line was electrified in the late 1950s by the Eastern Region of British Railways with electric services commencing on 21 November 1960. Early services were formed of Class 305 EMUs but initial technical problems with these saw replacements by Class 302 and Class 304 EMUs.

There is a plastic owl in the underside of the canopy over platform two, just outside the newsagent&#x27;s, an attempt to stop pigeons landing there. Ticket barriers were installed in 2011.

Operation transferred from Abellio Greater Anglia to London Overground on 31 May 2015.

<text>Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; L. Watson (October 4, 1926 – October 20, 2012) was the former president of the Irvine Company, and served as chief planner during the 1960s and 1970s. He was also chairman of Walt Disney Productions from 1983 to 1984, and served on the Disney board from 1972 until March 2004.

==Early life and education==
Raymond L. Watson was born in Seattle, Washington on October 4, 1926, to Olive Lorentzon, a Norwegian schoolteacher, and Leslie Watson, a Scots-Irish carpenter. They lived in Greenwood, a low-lying Seattle suburb. While celebrating his sister Doris&#x27;s third birthday, his mother suffered a stroke and fell into a coma, dying three months later aged 33. Her death and the Great Depression created a &quot;period of instability&quot; within the Watson family as they became dependent on relatives while his father looked for work, eventually getting a job constructing state park buildings in Oakland, California. After moving to Oakland in 1934, Watson was raised by his grandmother, spending his summers at the state beaches and parks where his father worked as a carpenter. After a short stint in the U.S. Army Air Corps Cadet Training Program toward the end of World War II, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving his B.A. in 1951 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1953, both in architecture.

==Business career==
Watson was hired in 1960 as chief planner of the Irvine Company. During his time at the Irvine Company, Watson oversaw development of the City of Irvine; the University of California, Irvine; Newport Center; and Fashion Island as well as numerous residential villages throughout Orange County.

In a 1996 essay in the Orange County Register, Watson wrote of his development and planning work in Irvine: “Irvine the community, the town, the city, is what you, the citizens of Irvine, have built. You&#x27;ve built an outstanding education system within the walls of the school buildings. You&#x27;ve created and run an outstanding recreation program that used the open space, parks and lakes (William) Pereira visualized and we built. You bring life and therefore community to the shopping and entertainment centers we&#x27;ve built. The Irvine villages we conceived are now your communities, home to your homes.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
A pedestrian bridge was named in Watson’s honor in 2005 (Watson Bridge). An inscription at the site credits Watson as a “Modern Renaissance Man.” This bridge is owned by the City of Irvine, and connects the University of California, Irvine to the Irvine Company&#x27;s University Center.

In 2006, Raymond Watson was awarded The Medal by the University of California, Irvine.

Watson is a former trustee of the University of California, Irvine Foundation and a former member of The Paul Merage School of Business Dean&#x27;s Advisory Board. Watson was chair of the Daniel G. Aldrich Society and in 1997, was honored with the Center for Real Estate Lifetime Achievement Award.

He was also elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1971; served as University of California Regent’s Professor in the Graduate School of Management at UCI; received the California Council’s 1986 Award for Excellence in Architects in Industry, and was elected to the California Building Industry’s Hall of Fame in 1988.

==Personal life==
Watson and his wife, Elsa, lived in the same Newport Beach home for 48 years, in the East Bluff development that he helped plan. They were lifetime members of the University of California, Irvine Chancellor&#x27;s Club.

<doc id="877817" wikidata="Q966577" url="?curid=877817" title="United and uniting churches">
<text>A united church, also called a uniting church, is a denomination formed from the merger or other form of church union of two or more different Protestant Christian denominations, a number of which come from separate and distinct denominational orientations or traditions. Multi-denominationalism, or a multi-denominational church or organization, is a congregation or organization that is affiliated with two or more Christian denominations, whether they be part of the same tradition or from separate and distinct traditions.

Historically, unions of Protestant churches were enforced by the state, usually in order to have a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also for other organizational reasons. As modern Christian ecumenism progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches.

Examples include the United Church of Canada (1925), the Church of South India (1947), the Uniting Church in Australia (1977), the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (2004), and the United Protestant Church of France (2013).

In the developing world, this model has been attractive in countries where Protestants are a small minority of the population; by pooling resources and endorsing cross-attendance between denominations, churches can serve a wider geographical area. In the developed world, since the mid-20th century, and the rise of secularism worldwide, mainline Protestantism has shrunk, reducing the viability of many individual denominations maintaining parallel administrative structures. Among others, Reformed (Calvinist), Anglican, and Lutheran churches have merged, often creating large nationwide denominations. In some countries, Methodist and Congregational denominations have also merged. The phenomenon is much less common among evangelical, nondenominational and charismatic church as new ones arise and many of them remain independent of each other, although in some cases instances of evangelical church congregations joining multiple denominations in a phenomenon known as &quot;multi-denominationalism&quot; does occur; but in most cases Evangelicals cooperate with each other through interdenominationalism while still maintaining denominational distinctions.

Perhaps the oldest official united church is found in Germany, where the Protestant Church in Germany is a federation of Lutheran, United (Prussian Union) and Reformed churches, a union dating back to 1817. The first of the series of unions was at a synod in Idstein to form the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau in August 1817, commemorated in naming the church of Idstein Unionskirche one hundred years later.

Around the world, each united or uniting church comprises a different mix of predecessor Protestant denominations. Trends are visible, however, as most united and uniting churches have one or more predecessors with heritage in the Reformed tradition and many are members of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.

== Conciliar movement ==
In the 1950s and 1960s an ecumenical spirit emerged in many churches in the United States, leading to a conciliar movement known in some circles as Conciliarity. A product of this movement was the Consultation on Church Union (COCU). The COCU disbanded formally in 2002 but moved into the Churches Uniting in Christ movement.

<text>Thomas Leo Browning (April 28, 1960 – December 19, 2022) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1984 to 1995, spending almost his entire career with the Cincinnati Reds. In his rookie season in 1985, Browning won 20 games and was runner-up for the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award; he was the Reds&#x27; first 20-game winner in 15 years, and equalled the most wins by a Cincinnati lefthander since 1925. He quickly became a mainstay in the team&#x27;s pitching rotation, leading the NL in games started four of the next five years. Browning pitched the twelfth perfect game in major league history on September 16, 1988, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, just the third perfect game by a lefthander; it was the highlight of a season in which he was 18–5, posting the league&#x27;s second-highest winning percentage. He helped the Reds to a sweep in the 1990 World Series, winning Game 3 against the defending champion Oakland Athletics. In 1991, his last full season, Browning was named to the NL All-Star team.

Browning&#x27;s 123 wins with the Reds ranked fourth among lefthanders when he retired, and remain the most by any Reds pitcher active since 1971; his 298 starts trail only Eppa Rixey among the team&#x27;s lefthanders. He later became a broadcaster and minor league pitching coach, and co-authored the book &quot;Tom Browning&#x27;s Tales from the Reds Dugout&quot;. Browning was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Pre-Major League Baseball career==

===College===
Browning played college baseball at Le Moyne College in Syracuse from 1979 to 1981 and Tennessee Wesleyan College in Athens, Tennessee from 1981 to 1982.

===Minor leagues===
Browning was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the ninth round of the 1982 June draft out of Tennessee Wesleyan College in Athens, Tennessee. That year, he led the Pioneer League in strikeouts and innings pitched, and after learning a screwball during the Fall Instruction League, went 8–1 with 101 strikeouts in innings pitched for Class-A Tampa in 1983. He eventually earned a midseason promotion to Class-AA Waterbury and struck out 101 batters in innings pitched.

Browning began the 1984 season with Class-AAA Wichita, where he went 12–10 with a league-high 160 strikeouts. On July 31 of that year, he threw a seven-inning no-hitter against Iowa and later earned a September call-up to play for Pete Rose&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds. In his major-league debut, Browning beat Orel Hershiser and the Los Angeles Dodgers while pitching innings and giving up just one run. He finished the year with a 1–0 record and recorded a 1.54 ERA to retain his spot on the major-league club the following season.

==Major League Baseball career==

===Early career===
As a rookie, Browning went 20–9 with a 3.55 ERA for the Reds, becoming the first rookie to win 20 games since the Yankees&#x27; Bob Grim in 1954. Browning finished the season with 11 consecutive wins—the longest streak by a Cincinnati pitcher in 30 years—and was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; NL Rookie Pitcher of the Year. He also finished second (behind Vince Coleman) in NL Rookie of the Year voting.

Browning was superstitious and did not shave between starts. As a result, he was often photographed with a four-day stubble. He also wore red underwear on the days he pitched.

Browning would go on to post double-digit win totals for seven straight seasons and consistently ranked among the league leaders in starts, innings pitched, and shutouts. One of his best seasons came in 1988, when he went 18–5 with a 3.41 ERA and teamed with 23-game-winner Danny Jackson.

====Perfect game====
On September 16, 1988, Browning pitched the 12th perfect game in baseball history. In a 1–0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium, Browning threw 70 of 102 pitches for strikes and did not run the count to three balls on a single batter. The first left-hander to pitch a perfect game since Sandy Koufax&#x27;s perfect game in 1965, Browning remains the only Reds player to pitch a perfect game. Three months earlier, on June 6, 1988, Browning had a bid for a no-hitter broken up by Tony Gwynn, who singled with one out in the ninth.

Browning just missed becoming the first pitcher to hurl two perfect games, taking another bid into the ninth on July 4, 1989, against the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium; a lead-off double by Dickie Thon broke up this attempt.

===1990 World Series===
In 1990, the Reds went to the postseason for the first and only time in Browning&#x27;s career. He won 15 games that season and picked up a key win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series. The Reds would meet the heavily favored Oakland A&#x27;s in the World Series that year, but thanks in part to Browning&#x27;s victory in Game 3, the Reds pulled off an unlikely sweep to become champions. &quot;That 1990 season was, without a doubt, the most enjoyable season of baseball I have ever been a part of,&quot; he said.

Browning&#x27;s wife went into labor late in Game 2 of the World Series. Browning left the stadium to be with his wife at the hospital. However, as the game entered extra innings and the Reds&#x27; manager Lou Piniella realized his pitcher was absent, the Reds called the announcers and had them issue a statement on radio and TV asking Browning to return to the ballpark in case he had to pitch. While Browning did hear the message, he stayed with his wife. The Reds won in the 10th inning.

===Late career===
Browning battled injuries from 1991 to 1993—going 27–26—but after a 10–4 start to the 1991 season, he earned a spot on the All-Star team, though he did not appear in the NL&#x27;s 4–2 loss. Two years later on July 7, 1993, he sneaked out of Wrigley Field during a Reds-Cubs game and spent a half inning with fans on the rooftop of 3643 North Sheffield Avenue in full uniform in one of baseball&#x27;s most legendary pranks. The gag earned Browning a $500 fine from Reds manager Davey Johnson.

Browning entered the 1994 season healthy. However, during a start in San Diego on May 9, Browning&#x27;s arm broke while delivering a pitch to Archi Cianfrocco. The injury was gruesome, with spectators and television viewers able to see Browning&#x27;s arm separate from his shoulder, and hearing a popping sound simultaneously. He missed the remainder of the season. He attempted a comeback with the Kansas City Royals in 1995, starting two games in May but losing both with an 8.10 ERA, but he decided to take the rest of the season off and to continue rehabbing his arm. He entered camp with the Royals again in 1996 but retired before the season began.

Browning retired with a 123–90 record, a 3.94 ERA, and 31 complete games. His 123 wins with the Reds rank 12th on Cincinnati&#x27;s all-time leaders list.

==Post-playing career==

In December 2005, Browning led fan balloting wire-to-wire to become a 2006 Reds Hall of Famer.

In February 2006, new Reds CEO Bob Castellini invited Browning to spring training as a special instructor. He broadcast Dayton Dragons (a Class-A affiliate of the Reds) games during the 2006 season and was the pitching coach for the Dragons&#x27; 2012 and 2015 seasons.

In 2007, Browning was named the pitching coach for the Reds&#x27; Rookie Advanced level Billings Mustangs farm club.

==Personal life==
Browning&#x27;s book, &quot;Tom Browning&#x27;s Tales from the Reds Dugout&quot;, debuted in March 2006 and was co-authored by Reds employee Dann Stupp.

On March 30, 2009, Browning was arrested for non-payment of child support and was held on $99,008.36 bail.

On February 27, 2018, Browning and his three sons purchased Bart&#x27;s on York, a small bar located in northern Kentucky, across the river from Great American Ballpark. The bar has been registered under the name Browning&#x27;s on York; the official name change occurred on the 2018 Reds opening day.

, Browning&#x27;s son Logan was a pitcher in the Boston Red Sox farm system.

Browning had two sisters and two brothers.

Browning was arrested and charged with an OVI (or DUI) for falling asleep and driving his car through a house on August 27, 2022, in Georgetown, Ohio. His blood alcohol content was 0.127.

===Death===
On December 19, 2022, Boone County, Kentucky Sheriff&#x27;s Department officers and emergency personnel responded to Browning&#x27;s home in Union, Kentucky. Upon arriving they found Browning not breathing. Attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful.

<doc id="877860" wikidata="Q223130" url="?curid=877860" title="Third Army (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Third Army was a field army of the British Army during World War I that saw active service on the Western Front throughout the war.

==First World War==
The Third Army was part of the British Army during World War I. It was formed in France on 13 July 1915, under the command of Lieutenant-General Charles Monro. During August 1915 the Third Army took over a trench line south of the French Tenth Army, which had to keep in position for the forthcoming autumn offensive. This made the Third Army geographically separate from the other British armies for the time being. This remained the case until March 1916, when the Tenth Army was moved to take part in the Battle of Verdun because of French losses and the Fourth Army was formed in preparation for the Battle of the Somme.

The battles it took part in on the Western Front included:
* Battle of the Somme
* Battle of Cambrai
* Second Battle of Arras (April 1917)
* Battle of Passchendaele
* Battle of Amiens (August 1918)
* Hundred Days Offensive

===Order of battle===

* General Edmund Allenby (23 October 1915 – 9 June 1917)
* General Sir Julian Byng (9 June 1917 – 22 March 1919)

==Second World War==

The army was not reraised during the Second World War. However, due to various Allied deception efforts, German intelligence over-estimated the number of Allied forces based within the UK by the start of 1944. While there was no specific deception effort to create the Third Army, German intelligence believed that one had been formed from Northern Command.

<text>William Stanley Merwin (September 30, 1927 – March 15, 2019) was an American poet who wrote more than fifty books of poetry and prose and produced many works in translation. During the 1960s anti-war movement, Merwin&#x27;s unique craft was thematically characterized by indirect, unpunctuated narration. In the 1980s and 1990s, his writing influence derived from an interest in Buddhist philosophy and deep ecology. Residing in a rural part of Maui, Hawaii, he wrote prolifically and was dedicated to the restoration of the island&#x27;s rainforests.

Merwin received many honors, including the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1971 and 2009; the National Book Award for Poetry in 2005, and the Tanning Prize — one of the highest honors bestowed by the Academy of American Poets — as well as the Golden Wreath of the Struga Poetry Evenings. In 2010, the Library of Congress named him the 17th United States Poet Laureate. Alongside co-author Takako Lento, he received the Japan–U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature in 2013 for their translation of &quot;Collected Haiku of Yosa Buson&quot;.

== Early life ==

W. S. Merwin was born in New York City on September 30, 1927. He grew up on the corner of Fourth Street and New York Avenue in Union City, New Jersey, and lived there until 1936, when his family moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania. As a child, Merwin was enamored of the natural world, sometimes finding himself talking to the large tree in his back yard. He was also fascinated with things that he saw as links to the past, such as the building behind his home that had once been a barn which housed a horse and carriage. At the age of five he started writing hymns for his father, a Presbyterian minister.

== Career ==
=== Early career: 1952–1976 ===
Merwin graduated from Princeton University with a B.A. in English in 1948, where he studied with R.P. Blackmur and befriended Blackmur&#x27;s graduate assistant, the poet John Berryman. He stayed at Princeton a year afterward to do graduate work. In 1952, Merwin married Dorothy Jeanne Ferry, and moved to Spain. During his stay there, while visiting the renowned poet Robert Graves at his homestead on the island of Majorca, he served as tutor to Graves&#x27;s son. There, he met Dido Milroy, fifteen years his senior, with whom he collaborated on a play and whom he later married and lived with in London. In 1956, Merwin moved to Boston for a fellowship at the Poets&#x27; Theater. He returned to London, where he befriended Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. In 1968, Merwin moved to New York City, separating from his wife Dido Milroy, who stayed at their home in France. In the late 1970s, Merwin moved to Hawaii and eventually was divorced from Dido Milroy. He married Paula Dunaway in 1983.
From 1956 to 1957, Merwin was also playwright-in-residence at the Poet&#x27;s Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts; he became poetry editor at &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1962. Besides being a prolific poet, he was a respected translator of Spanish, French, Latin and Italian literature and poetry (including Lazarillo de Tormes and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot;) as well as poetry from Sanskrit, Yiddish, Middle English, Japanese and Quechua. He served as selector of poems of the American poet Craig Arnold (1967–2009).

Merwin is known for his poetry about the Vietnam War and can be included among the canon of Vietnam War-era poets which includes writers Robert Bly, Robert Duncan, Adrienne Rich, Denise Levertov, Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg and Yusef Komunyakaa.

Merwin&#x27;s early subjects were frequently tied to mythological or legendary themes, while many of his poems featured animals. A volume called &quot;The Drunk in the Furnace&quot; (1960) marked a change for Merwin, in that he began to write in a more autobiographical way.

In the 1960s, Merwin lived in a small apartment in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village.

=== Later career: 1977–2019 ===

Merwin&#x27;s volume &quot;Migration: New and Selected Poems&quot; won the 2005 National Book Award for poetry.

In 1998, Merwin wrote &quot;Folding Cliffs: A Narrative&quot;, an ambitious novel-in-verse about Hawaiʻi in history and legend.

&quot;The Shadow of Sirius&quot;, published in 2008 by Copper Canyon Press, was awarded the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for poetry.

In June 2010, the Library of Congress named Merwin the seventeenth United States Poet Laureate, to replace the outgoing Kay Ryan. He is the subject of the 2014 feature documentary film &quot;Even Though the Whole World Is Burning&quot;, directed by Stefan Schaefer. A one-hour version, entitled &quot;To Plant a Tree&quot;, was broadcast nationally on PBS. Merwin appeared in the PBS documentary &quot;The Buddha&quot;, released in 2010. He had moved to Hawaii to study with the Zen Buddhist master Robert Aitken in 1976.

In 2010, with his wife Paula, he co-founded The Merwin Conservancy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving his hand-built, off-the-grid poet&#x27;s home and 18-acre restored property in Haiku, Maui, which has been transformed from an &quot;agricultural wasteland&quot; to a &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; for rare palm trees, one of the largest and most biodiverse collections of palms in the world.

Merwin&#x27;s last book of poetry, &quot;Garden Time&quot; (Copper Canyon Press, 2016), was composed during the difficult process of losing his eyesight. When he could no longer see well enough to write, he dictated poems to his wife, Paula. It is a book about aging and the practice of living one&#x27;s life in the present. Writing about &quot;Garden Time&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jeff Gordinier suggests that &quot;Merwin&#x27;s work feels like part of some timeless continuum, a river that stretches all the way back to Han Shan and Li Po.&quot;

In 2017, Copper Canyon Press published &quot;The Essential W. S. Merwin&quot;, a book which traces the seven-decade legacy of Merwin&#x27;s poetry, with selections ranging from his 1952 debut, &quot;A Mask for Janus&quot;, to 2016&#x27;s &quot;Garden Time&quot;, as well as a selection of translations and lesser-known prose narratives. Merwin&#x27;s literary papers are held at the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The collection consists of some 5,500 archival items, and 450 printed books.

== Death ==
Merwin lived on land that was part of a pineapple plantation, on the northeast coast of Maui, Hawaii.

W.S Merwin died on March 15, 2019, in his sleep at his home, as reported by his publisher Copper Canyon Press.
