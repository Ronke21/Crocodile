<text>The Nissan 300ZX is a sports car that was produced across two different generations. As with all other versions of the Z, the 300ZX was sold within the Japanese domestic market under the name Fairlady Z.

It was sold in Japan from 1983 to 2000 and in the United States from 1984 to 1996, the 300ZX name followed the numerical convention initiated with the original Z car, the Nissan Fairlady Z (S30), which was marketed in the U.S. as the 240Z. The addition of the &quot;X&quot; to the car&#x27;s name was a carryover from its predecessor, the 280ZX, to signify the presence of more luxury and comfort oriented features. The first generation 300ZX known as the Z31 model was produced from 1983 through 1989 and was a sales success becoming the highest volume Z-car for Nissan.

To become even more competitive in the sports car market, the second generation 300ZX was driven up-market. It was redesigned to be faster and to feature more advanced technology, but came with a higher price than its predecessor, with consecutive price increases each model year of availability. As such, sales dwindled each year, a trend in the higher end sports car market at the time, and Nissan placed a hiatus on selling new Nissan Z-Cars to the US after the 1996 model year, though the car would continue to be sold in the Japan domestic market until 2001 in low production numbers.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; placed the Z32 on its Ten Best list for seven consecutive years, each model year of its availability in the United States. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; awarded it as the 1990 Import Car of the Year. The Nissan 350Z, officially the Z33 generation Z-Car, succeeded the 300ZX in 2003.
==Z31==


The Z31 chassis designation was first introduced in Japan on September 16, 1983, as the Fairlady Z. Designed by Kazumasu Takagi and his team of developers, the Z31 improved aerodynamics and increased power when compared to its predecessor, the 280ZX. The newer Z-car had a drag coefficient of 0.30 and many were powered by Japan&#x27;s first mass-produced V6 engine instead of the inline-sixes of the previous Z-cars. According to Nissan, the new V6 engine was intended to uphold the sporty, six-cylinder spirit of the original Fairlady Z, but in a more compact and efficient package.

===Mechanical===

All Z31s were equipped with engines that had electronic fuel injection (EFI), and all cars were rear wheel drive. There were five engine options in total: A turbocharged dual overhead cam 2.0 L straight-six (&quot;RB20DET&quot; (NICS), used in the 200ZR), a turbocharged single overhead cam 2.0 L V6 (&quot;VG20ET&quot;, found in the Japanese domestic market 200Z/ZS/ZG), a naturally aspirated single overhead cam 3.0 L V6 (&quot;VG30E&quot;, found in 300ZX), a turbocharged single overhead cam 3.0 L V6 (&quot;VG30ET&quot;, used in 300ZX Turbo) and a naturally aspirated dual overhead cam 3.0 L V6 (&quot;VG30DE&quot;, used in 300ZR).

Many of the Z31s were equipped with the new &quot;VG&quot; family of V6 engines, which was Japan&#x27;s first 60-degree V6, unlike its predecessors, which used &quot;L&quot;-series I6 engines. The &quot;VG&quot; engines were found in the 200Z/ZS/ZG, 300ZX and 300ZR trims, from 2.0L to 3.0L. The VG30 engine was either a type A or type B sub-designation from 1984 to March 1987, while models from April 1987 to 1989 had a W sub-designation. The W-series engines featured redesigned water jackets for additional cooling, and fully floating piston wrist pins. Finally, these engines were equipped with self-adjusting hydraulic valve lifters.

Some Z31s are equipped with the turbocharged &quot;RB20DET&quot; engine, which are the last Z-cars to use a inline-six cylinder engine; these were sold as the Fairlady Z 200ZR, of which roughly 8,283 were produced between 1985 and 1988. 200ZR&#x27;s came in two trims; 200ZR-I (base model with the &#x27;slicktop roof,&#x27; crank windows, A/C, base model creature comforts, and only with a manual transmission), and 200ZR-II (t-top roof, more electronic options, and available with an optional automatic transmission). 200ZR models also came standard with the R200 limited slip differential, white faced gauges, and ZR specific cloth upholstery.

The Z31s are equipped with a 5-speed manual or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission; all Z31 automatics were the E4N71B equipped with torque-converter lockup, including turbo models. All Z31s were equipped with a Nissan R200 rear differential. April 1987 and later turbo models received a modified R200 featuring a clutch-based limited-slip differential, except 1988 Shiro Specials which had a viscous-type limited slip differential.

===Technology===

As with some other Nissan models of the period, the new Z31s were equipped with a &quot;Voice Warning System&quot;. The Voice Warning System used a pre-recorded voice box, the vehicle&#x27;s radio and driver&#x27;s door speaker to mute the radio and provide a vocal warning whenever the left or right door was ajar, the exterior lights were left on after the vehicle was turned off, parking brake was left on while trying to operate the car, or the fuel level was low. This system was dropped for the 1987 model year.

Other technological features in the 300ZX included a &quot;Body Sonic&quot; audio system (which utilized a separate amplifier and speakers in the vehicle&#x27;s front seats that allowed bass from music to be felt by the vehicle&#x27;s occupants), analog gauges, stereo and climate control, or an optional digital gauge cluster, digital stereo with equalizer and an optional fully digital climate control system.

===Chassis===
The Z31 chassis was based on the 280ZX. Although the newer chassis had the same wheelbase and MacPherson strut/semi-trailing arm independent suspension design, it handled and accelerated better than the 280ZX it replaced. Turbocharged models, except for the Shiro Special edition, lower trim 200Z models, and the 200ZR-I, had 3-way electronically adjustable shock absorbers. The Z31 was available in either left or right hand drive.

===Style and evolution===

As originally released, the Z31 used black polypropylene bumper covers and body side moldings, with black front and rear spoilers. Turbo models had a hood-mounted scoop mounted off-center. All cars were fitted with a T-top roof.

The Z31 body was slightly restyled in 1986 with the addition of side skirts, flared fenders, and sixteen inch wheels (turbo models only). Many black plastic trim pieces were also painted to match the body color, and the hood scoop was removed.

The car was given a final makeover in 1987 that included more aerodynamic bumpers, fog lamps within the front air dam, and 9004 bulb-based headlamps that replaced the outdated sealed beam headlights. The 300ZX-titled reflector in the rear was updated to a narrow set of tail lights running the entire width of the car and an LED third brake light on top of the rear hatch. This was the first car in history to have the central brake light with LED, in 1987 model year, made by Stanley Electric.

The Z31 continued selling until 1989, longer than any other Z-Car at the time. Cars produced from 1984 to 1985 are referred to as &quot;Zenki&quot; or &quot;Zenki-gata&quot; models, while cars produced from 1987 to 1989 are known as &quot;Kouki&quot; or &quot;Kouki-gata&quot; models. The 1986 models are unique due to sharing some major features from both. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;Chuki&quot; models, but are usually grouped with the Zenki models because of the head and tail lights.

===North American market===
North America was the main market for the 300ZX, as for previous generations of the Z-car. It was introduced to the United States in October 1983, along with the remainder of Nissan&#x27;s 1984 model year lineup. By now the &quot;Datsun&quot; nameplate had been completely retired in North America. Over 70,000 units were sold in North America in 1985 alone. There were three trim models available: SF, GL, and GLL. The SF model was only available in Canada. The new V6 (2960 cc) Single overhead cam engine was available as a naturally aspirated VG30E or a turbocharged VG30ET producing , respectively. The 1984 to 1987 turbo models featured a Garrett T3 turbocharger with a 7.8:1 compression ratio, whereas 1988 to 1989 models featured a low inertia T25 turbocharger with an increased 8.3:1 compression ratio and slightly more power — naturally aspirated and turbocharged.

For the 1986 model year, the base two-seater model was made available without the T-bars, creating a lower cost entry-level version.

====Special editions====
Two Special Edition versions of the Z31 generation model were produced by Nissan; a 50th Anniversary Edition celebrated the company&#x27;s semi-centennial in 1984 and offered additional luxury features, and a &quot;Shiro Special&quot;, released four years later, with performance-oriented upgrades.

The 1984 300ZX 50th Anniversary Edition, released to celebrate the automaker&#x27;s half-century, was a turbocharged coupé (two-seater) model with a Light Pewter/Thunder Black color scheme. All 50th Anniversary Editions came equipped with a digital dash and ancillary gauges including average mileage, G-force, and compass readouts, in-car electronic adjustable shocks, &quot;Bodysonic&quot; speakers in the seats, cruise and radio controls in the steering wheel, mirrored t-tops, embroidered leather seats, embroidered floor mats, sixteen-inch (406 mm) aluminum wheels, rear fender flares, flared front fenders, a 50th AE logo badge on the driver&#x27;s side front fender, and grey cloth indoor car cover with 50AE printing. The only option available to the 50th Anniversary Edition was the choice between an automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. 5,148 AE models were produced for the U.S. market and 300 for the Canadian market. A non-turbo 2+2 model was also available with 50AE badging in the Australian market.
In 1988, the turbocharged Shiro Special debuted with pearl white paint, stiffer springs and matched shocks, heavy-duty anti-sway bars, a unique front air dam, paint matched wheels, Recaro seats with matching door panels, painted bumperettes, white painted door handles and a viscous limited-slip differential. No options were available for the Shiro. It was the fastest car out of Japan, capable of speeds, as tested by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; with the electronic speed limiter disabled. A total of 1,002 Shiro Special Z31s were produced for the U.S. market between January and March 1988, plus an additional 75 units for the Canadian market.

===Japanese market===
In Japan, the Z31 was marketed as the Fairlady Z and was originally only available with two turbocharged engines: the VG20ET in the regular Fairlady Z and the VG30ET in the Fairlady Z 300ZX. Both outputs are JIS Gross and both engines use the Garrett AiResearch T03 turbocharger. The 300ZX, unencumbered by Japanese Government dimension regulations restricting overall width to less than was somewhat wider than the 2-liter models, at . Japanese 300ZX buyers were liable for additional yearly taxes that affected sales. As originally introduced, all Japanese market Fairlady Z&#x27;s were slicktops, but the T-top option was made available in February 1984.

The 2-liter models later gained the 200Z, 200ZG, or 200ZS monikers to help differentiate from the larger, three-liter models. They all used the VG20ET engine while the 200ZR came with the RB20DET. The 300ZX came with the VG30ET, with similar specifications to the USDM model. The only Fairlady Z variant to use the VG30DE engine, and the only Japanese-market model with a naturally aspirated engine, was the 300ZR. It continued to be marketed as a companion fastback to the more formal appearance of the Nissan Skyline-based Nissan Leopard coupé at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; Japanese dealerships.

The 200ZR model was introduced in October 1985 featuring the RB20DET NICS with the worlds ceramic turbocharger, which was a joint project between Nissan and NGK. Maximum power output is Net. The 200ZR was offered on both wheelbases and as a slicktop (200ZR-I) or as a T-top (200ZR-II). 1986 model year 200ZR&#x27;s feature a prominent central hood scoop. This was made much smaller with the October 1986 facelift, which generally made for a smoother appearance overall. With the facelift, claimed power of the turbocharged 300ZX dropped to as Nissan changed from Gross to Net ratings, and the VG20-powered models were discontinued. This was also when the DOHC, naturally aspirated, 300ZR model was added to the lineup, with , making for three differently engined models with nearly the same performance. The 300ZR was positioned as a sportier alternative to the 300ZX Turbo, with tighter suspension settings, while the turbocharged 300ZX was now only offered with an automatic transmission, and the 200ZR was a budget alternative as it fit into a lower tax and insurance category thanks to its smaller engine. Additionally, the smaller engine in the 200ZR dropped the cars weight by 170kg (roughly 375lbs) compared to cars equipped with the VG30ET.

&quot;ZR&quot; models all featured R200 limited slip differentials with lower gearing rations compared to North American models, and could be optioned with Recaro seats in facelifted examples, in either 2+0 or 2+2 configurations.

===European models===
The European turbo models, as well as those sold in other markets unencumbered by strict emissions regulations, produce due to higher lift and higher duration on the camshaft profile, also known outside of Europe as the Nismo camshafts. The two-seater model was not available in mainland Europe but was available in the United Kingdom. Some models were also equipped without catalytic converters. All European turbocharged models received a different front lower spoiler as well, with 84-86 models being unique and 87-89 production having the same spoiler as the USDM 1988 Shiro Special model.

Swedish- and Swiss-market models (as well as those sold in Australia) received exhaust gas recirculation control systems to meet those countries particular emissions regulations.

===Australian models===
All Australian model Z31 300ZXs were 2+2 T-top body, with an engine offering of either the 3.0L V6 N/A VG30E, or the 3.0L V6 Turbo Charged VG30ET. The cars sold in 1984 and &#x27;85 were all naturally aspirated with no catalytic converter, while the turbocharged version was the only model available from 1986 to 1988. There was only one trim level in Australia, with the digital dashboard and climate control being an optional upgrade package, and leather seats only available in the redesigned series 3 &quot;Californian&quot; models. The Australian factory service manual provides camshaft measurements which do not match any of the known USDM or EDM camshaft profiles, the FSM states the exhaust valve has an open duration of 252 degrees, but the specified opening and closing angles add up to 258 degrees. All Australian publication content express that N/A versions possess , along with the turbocharged versions as . The Australian 50th Anniversary Edition was more basic than the U.S. version, the 50th AE was a normal n/a 300ZX with the digital dash package, a black interior, black velour seats, and a 50th AE badge on the exterior. The exterior badge was fixed to the cars by dealerships, so the position of the badge is not the same on all models. There was no Shiro Special in Australia, and no models featured the adjustable shock absorbers.

==Z32==
===Design===

The Z32 was designed by Isao Sono and Toshio Yamashita, approved in final form by Nissan management on October 1, 1986. The body was wider with a rounder profile and fewer hard edges. It had a marginally increased coefficient of drag of 0.31 compared to the Z31&#x27;s 0.30. Nissan utilized the Cray-2 supercomputer to design the new Z32 with a form of CAD software making it one of the first production cars to utilize this tool.

Like previous generations, Nissan offered a 4-seater (&quot;2+2&quot;) model with the Z32. All Z32s initially featured T-tops as standard. A hardtop (nicknamed &quot;Slicktop&quot;) model was available in North America, only in Naturally Aspirated guise, and in Japan was available as Naturally Aspirated as well as an extremely rare Twin Turbo model (Japan-only). All &quot;Slicktops&quot; were 2 seaters (&quot;2+0&quot;).

In 1992, a 2-seat convertible version (produced by ASC) was introduced for the first time, in response to aftermarket conversions.

===Mechanical===

The &quot;VG30DE&quot; V6 engine was carried over from the previous generation 300ZX (Z31), but fitted with a DOHC head and variable valve timing (N-VCT), producing at 6,400 rpm and at 4,800 rpm in naturally aspirated (NA) form. During instrumented testing conducted by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; in 1989, the NA car recorded a time of 6.7 seconds to accelerate from 0 to , an elapsed time of 15.0 seconds over with a trap speed of , and a maximum speed of .

The high output engine (&quot;VG30DETT&quot;) was upgraded with Garrett AiResearch parallel twin-turbochargers and dual intercoolers, producing at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 3,600 rpm. Benefiting from Project 901, the Z32 was the first car to be marketed following the introduction of the power ceiling imposed by JAMA that remained until 2004. Performance varied for the sprint from 0 to , with recorded times of 5.0-6.0 seconds depending on the source, and a governed top speed of .

Output was detuned slightly to when the optional automatic transmission was fitted, but an automatic-equipped car was slightly faster to accelerate to , taking 15.8 seconds compared to 16.3 seconds for the manual.

All Z32s used the same multilink rear suspension, a design shared with other Project 901 cars. Twin Turbocharged Z32s also featured adjustable two mode suspension and the four-wheel steering systems called &quot;Super HICAS&quot; &quot;(High Capacity Actively Controlled Steering)&quot;, first introduced on the R31 Nissan Skyline.

===Regional variations===
====North America====
American Z-car sales reached one million sales during the 1990 model year, making it at that time the best selling sports car. In America the 300ZX faced the same fate of many Japanese sports cars of the time. While the 1989 300ZX was priced at around $30,000, its final model year price increased to about $50,000. The mid-1990s marketplace trends toward SUVs and the rising Yen:Dollar ratio contributed to the end of North American 300ZX sales in 1996 with over 80,000 in sales. A Commemorative Edition for the final 300 units shipped to America included decals and certificates of authenticity.

====Europe====

In the UK and Europe, all Z32s offered were in 2+2 TT form between 1990 and 1996 (1990-1994 for UK). They were sold through dealerships in the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Italy.

====Australia====
In Australia, all Z32s offered were in 2+2 NA form between 1990 and 1995.

====Japan====
In Japan, the 300ZX continued until August 2000. The Japanese Domestic Market was offered a number of variants unavailable to the international market such as the &quot;Version S&quot; (Spec Model), &quot;Version R&quot; (Ready Model) and Slicktop Twin Turbo (the most expensive trim option only available in Version S guise).

Version S was a base grade specification that includes all necessary road trim and items as standard, such as stereo and A/C. It could be ordered with various options separately. Options were available separately by order only, and include:

• 2+0 SWB 2-Seater T-Top trim
• 2+0 SWB 2-Seater solid roof (slicktop) trim
• 2+2 LWB 4-Seater T-Top trim
• Automatic Climate Control
• Cruise Control
• 8 Way Power Drivers Seat
• 4 Way Power Passengers Seat 
• Recaro Seats
• BOSE Audio
• VG30DE Naturally Aspirated Engine
• VG30DETT Twin Turbo Engine
• Super HICAS (only available on TT option)
• Anti-Lock Brake System
• Drivers Side Airbag
• Suede / Tweed / Cloth / Leather Seating
• All other available “Altia” options from order guide

Version R:

Available only on 2+2 LWB 4-Seater with the only major options being in N/A or Twin Turbo configuration, with automatic or manual transmissions, this trim came with preset options from the factory at a reduced (combined) cost, giving customers a “ready” model by which to order if they did not feel like ordering options one by one. This presented buyers with an easier choice selection and a “base model” car by which to settle for.

Standard features (for 1998) included:

• Recaro Seats
• Sideskirts
• Rear Spoiler
• Drivers Side Airbag
• Cloth Seats
• Anti-Lock Brakes
• Xenon HID Headlamps
• Cruise Control
• Automatic Climate Control

The only options were:

• Carbon / Marble Interior Trim
• Audio Equipment Package with EQ.
• Automatic or Manual Transmission
• VG30DE or VG30DETT

The aforementioned facelift of late 1998 featured a new front fascia, tail lights, optional Xenon HID headlights, optional rear spoiler, optional BBS mesh wheels, orange rear corner lights and an instrument cluster with white dials as well as other minor changes.

Early model Z32s (made pre-1994) and sold in Japan did not have Exhaust Gas Recirculation systems nor Air Injection Valve systems. All JDM Z32s used a front rebar system made out of fiberglass rather than steel (like their American Market counterparts), and also had different exhaust systems with lighter weight Catalytic Converters (with only one set on the JDM Twin Turbo model vs. two sets on the USDM Twin Turbo models). Given the lack of these regulatory items, JDM Z32s often weighed 100+lbs (45+kg) less than their American specification counterparts.

===Changes by model year===
The Z32 chassis underwent some changes during its production run between 1989 and 2000 (Japan) and 1990 to 1996 (US). The Z32&#x27;s extended model year sales in 1990 reached 39,290 units.

===Tuned variants===

In 1990, Motorsports International of Waco, Texas collaborated with Japanese tuning company HKS to create the SR-71 Z32, named for the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. The cars were upgraded with larger Garrett turbochargers, HKS electronics and a Kaminari body kit designed by Pete Brock. The SR-71 was California CARB certified and was to be sold through a select dealer network and Japanese performance tuning shops located within the United States. It was planned to build 500 cars per year through 1993. One hundred orders were already in hand, but it is claimed that just eight cars were built. The SR-71 claimed the title of the third fastest production car in the world in 1990 for a fraction of the price of a Lamborghini Diablo and Ferrari F40 according to the designer Randy Ball. The base price was $65,000 for the Z32 and SR-71 conversion.

In 1995 and 1996, Steve Millen Motorsports (Stillen), developed a SMZ model with Nissan North America that were sold throughout the U.S. and Canada through designated Nissan dealerships. The performance upgrades were covered by the factory warranty. These performance upgrades included: Skyline Group N/GT-R Brakes, which were cross drilled and axially vented rotors with larger calipers and pistons and upgraded HI-Metal front and rear brake pads; a high flow intake system, which allowed the engine to run more efficiently; an aluminized steel free flow exhaust system, which extended from the catalytic converter; and a turbocharger boost pressure increase, bringing the total output to and . Each vehicle was numbered in the engine bay and interior. A total of 104 SMZs were produced at $14,000 more than the standard Nissan Z32 Twin Turbo.

===Advertising===

Nissan aired a commercial during Super Bowl XXIV in 1990 advertising the new Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo. The 60-second commercial was directed by Ridley Scott and only aired once. Executives at Nissan pulled the commercial after the initial airing when they became concerned the commercial would promote street racing since the commercial features the 300ZX being faster than a sport bike, a Formula One car and a fighter jet.

Another memorable 300ZX commercial is &quot;Toys&quot; from 1996. Inspired by the film &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the commercial is set to Van Halen&#x27;s cover of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and depicts a G. I. Joe-like action figure coming to life, getting behind the wheel of a red 300ZX radio-controlled car and picking up a Barbie-like doll for a date, stealing her away from her husband, who resembles Ken. They then drive around the feet of Mr K, a caricature of former Nissan executive Yutaka Katayama acted by Dale Ishimoto, who smiles as he watches them go by. Toy manufacturer Mattel filed a lawsuit against Nissan in 1997, claiming the ad&#x27;s use of dolls that resemble G. I. Joe, Barbie and Ken amounted to &quot;trademark and copyright infringement&quot; and caused &quot;irreparable injury to Mattel&#x27;s name, business reputation and goodwill.&quot; Mattel sought unspecified damages and an injunction that would pull the ad off the air. Nissan defended the ad, claiming that the dolls were named &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Nick&quot; and &quot;Tad&quot; and that they were modeled after celebrities. Mattel and Nissan eventually settled the lawsuit out of court and observers noted that the lawsuit ultimately just gave Nissan and the advertisement further exposure and publicity.

==Motorsports==
The 300ZX was campaigned during 1984 and 1985 in showroom stock racing. The car scored a Trans Am win in 1986 at Lime Rock by Paul Newman for Bob Sharp Racing. This would be the only Trans Am win by a 300ZX.

From 1985 to 1987, the Electramotive-developed GTP ZX-Turbo was raced in the IMSA GT Championship&#x27;s GTP class and also the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, badged as a Fairlady Z, using a Lola T810 chassis and a VG30ET engine. Following development through 1987, the car would become dominant in IMSA GT in 1988. Additional factory endorsement, combined with a new chassis, transmission and more reliable Goodyear tires contributed to the team&#x27;s success. The SOHC VG30ET was making upwards of , with a power band that extended from 4,000 to 9,000 rpm on a single turbo.

From 1990 to 1995, Steve Millen drove the twin turbo 300ZX for Clayton Cunningham Racing. The car dominated the IMSA in its GTO, then later GTS categories due to its newly designed chassis and engine. Millen would rank as the #1 Factory Driver for Nissan for 7 years and earn two IMSA GTS Driving Championships and two IMSA GTS Manufacturer&#x27;s Championships. The biggest triumph for the Z32 racecar was the victory in the 1994 24 Hours of Daytona. In the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 300ZX ranked first in the GTS-1 class and 5th overall. In an attempt to level the playing field in the GTS-1 class by reducing the allowable horsepower, the IMSA declared the twin turbo VG engine ineligible for the 1995 season. The 1995 GTS 300ZX car would debut with the V8 Nissan VH engine at Daytona and would place first in the GTS-1 class at the 12 Hours of Sebring and Moosehead Grand Prix in Halifax.

The JUN-BLITZ Bonneville Z32 holds the E/BMS class land speed record of 260.87 mph (419.84 km/h) set at the 1995 Bonneville Speed Trial. The vehicle was built as a partnership between JUN Auto and BLITZ. In 1990, JUN&#x27;s first Z32 went 210.78 mph (339.2 km/h) at their Yatabe test course and hit 231.78 mph (373 km/h) after some tuning at Bonneville.

==Awards and recognition==
After the final year of U.S. sales (1996), the Z32 has continued to win awards:
* 2004: &quot;Automobile&quot; lists the Z32 as one of the 100 greatest cars of all time
* 2006: &quot;Automobile&quot; lists the Z32 on both the &quot;20 Greatest Cars of the Past 20 years&quot; and the &quot;25 Most Beautiful Cars in History&quot;
* 2010: &quot;GQ Magazine&quot; lists the Z32 as one of the most stylish cars over the past 50 years

From the year it was introduced, the Z32 has also won many comparison tests against similar sports cars, including the Mitsubishi 3000GT/Dodge Stealth, Mazda RX-7, Chevrolet Corvette, Toyota Supra, Dodge Viper, Porsche 944 S2, and Porsche 968.

==Safety==
In Australia, the 1990 to 1995 Nissan 300ZX was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings brochure as providing &quot;average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.

In the US, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave the 1991-1993 300ZX 3 out of 5 stars in front driver collision crash test ratings.

==Trivia==
Between 1999 and 2001, the Nissan 300ZX (Z32)&#x27;s headlights were also used under license on the Lamborghini Diablo, replacing its original pop-up lights.

<text>ROKAL is an acronym for RObert KAhrmann Lobberich, a manufacturer of metal castings that produced a line of model railway equipment in TT scale from 1947 to 1969, based in Lobberich 80 km north of Cologne, Germany at the Dutch border.

The Rokal product line was sold to Willy Ade of Röwa. Röwa issued at least one catalog that included items from the Rokal product line, but apparently only sold existing inventory from the Rokal purchase rather than manufacturing these items. Ade later sold his company to Roco of Salzburg, Austria and the Rokal TT line was not issued again.

The Rokal product line was of slightly different proportions from other TT scale lines. In later years of production, Rokal worked in joint venture with firms located in the former country of East Germany. The products of these companies were offered by Rokal with the Rokal style coupler and offered in their own product line with their proprietary coupler. These companies apparently used the same set of manufacturing tooling, marketing these items under names such as Zeuke, Zeuke &amp; Wegworth, &quot;Berliner TT-Bahnen&quot; (now Tillig) and possibly others.

<text>Maccabi Petah Tikva F.C. (; &quot;Maccabi Avshalom Ironi Petah Tikva F.C., ) is an Israeli professional football club based in the city of Petah Tikva. It is part of the Maccabi World Union for international Jewish sports clubs. 

They are the current Israel State Cup holders, having beaten Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva 1–0 in the final for their third title.

==History==
===1912: First steps in blue &amp; white===
The club was founded in 1912 by a group of Jewish students from Petah Tikva, who were studying in the Ottoman city of Constantinople (many of them would later serve in the Ottoman army during World War I), making it the second oldest Jewish football club in Israel after Maccabi Tel Aviv, which was formed in 1906.

===1920s: Pre-independence===
In 1921, after the death of founder member Avshalom Gissin during the 1921 Palestine riots, the club added his name to the club&#x27;s name, and the club was named &quot;Maccabi Avshalom Petah Tikva&quot;.
In 1927, the club moved to the Maccabi Petah Tikva Ground, where they would play until the 1970s.

===1930s: First major title===
In 1935 they won their first piece of silverware, beating Hakoah Tel Aviv 1–0 in the cup final. In 1939 they reached the final again, but lost 2–1 to Hapoel Tel Aviv. The following year they won the Haaretz tournament.

===1950s: Second major title and goals galore===
The club was included in the new Israeli League in 1949, and finished fifth in the inaugural post-independence league table. In the next season (1951–52, there was no 1950–51 edition) they finished as runners-up to champions Maccabi Tel Aviv and also won the State Cup, beating Maccabi Tel Aviv 1–0. In 1953–54 (1952–53 was also not played) they also finished second with Eliezer Spiegel finishing as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer on 16 goals from 22 matches.

===1960s: The dark times===
After several seasons of mid-table finishes, Maccabi finished bottom of the table in 1962–63 (a season in which the club were deducted 3 points due to suspicions of bribery during a game with Maccabi Jaffa) and were due to be relegated to Liga Alef. However, the Israel Football Association decided to expand the league from 12 to 15 clubs and they were spared demotion. However, the club was relegated for the first time at the end of the 1965–66 season after finishing second from bottom. 

After two seasons in Liga Alef (one of which – 1966–68 Liga Leumit – lasted for two years) the club won won the Liga Alef Super Cup and returned to the top division in 1968–69 as Liga Alef champions for the first time.

===1970s: We will be back!===
At the end of the 1970–71 season the club was relegated again after finishing second from bottom, but made an immediate return as Liga Alef champions (1971–72) for the second time.

At the beginning of 1972–73 season, the IFA organized a third-tier stand-alone cup competition (considered below the league and the state cup) to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. The cup was won by Maccabi Petah Tikva, who had beaten Maccabi Haifa 4–2 on penalties (1–1 a.e.t.) in the final.

In 1974–75 season, although Maccabi finished bottom, they were again reprieved from relegation due to league expansion. However, after a repeated performance in 1976–77 they did relegated for the third time. Following another immediate return to the top flight through a second place promotion (1977-78), the club maintained several mid-table finishes and have remained in top division for 10 seasons.

===1980s: Mediocrity at its finest===
At the beginning of 1982-83 season the IFA established Lilian Cup, a season opening tournament for the top 4 clubs in Liga Leumit the year before, considered a third-tier league cup tournament (in parallel to the Israel Super Cup, which was played at the end of the season, and the Toto Cup, which was played throughout the season, mostly on weekdays). Maccabi finished 1984–85 season in fourth place and gained a place in the 1985 Lilian Cup edition. The club reached the final, losing 3–1 (a.e.t.) to Beitar Jerusalem.

The club finished 1987–88 season at the bottom of the table and relegated for the fourth time. In 1989–90 and 1990–91 the club won the Toto Cup. After 3 seasons the club won the second-tier league championship for the third time (1990–91) and returned to the top division, remaining there for 21 seasons.

===1990s: First steps in Europe===
In 1991–92 season Maccabi finished seventh place, qualifying for the Intertoto Cup group for the first time (due to Hapoel Petah Tikva qualification for the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup). The club played in the Group stage with Czech side Slavia Prague, German top-club Bayer Leverkusen and the Israeli Maccabi Netanya. The whole stage was scheduled for July with Maccabi playing its first two matches in Petah Tikva Municipal Stadium, losing 1–3 against Slavia and winning 3–2 against Leverkusen. The next two games were against Netanya, Maccabi drew 0–0 in Netanya Stadium and 2–2 at home ground. At the following matches Maccabi was defeated 0–3 by Slavia in Stadion Eden and drew 1–1 against Leverkusen in Ulrich-Haberland-Stadion. However, the club finished only third place in the group with five points.

In 1994-95 season the club reached the top division&#x27;s Toto Cup final for the first time, beating 2–1 Maccabi Tel Aviv in Ramat Gan Stadium.

In 1996–97 season Maccabi finished fourth place, qualifying for the Intertoto Cup group stage for the second time. The whole stage was scheduled for June-July, with Maccabi losing 1–3 to German side Köln in Ramat Gan and deafeting the Austrian side Aarau 1–0 in Stadion Brügglifeld. The club also drew 0–0 twice, first against the Irish Cork City in Kiryat Eliezer Stadium and then against the Belgian giants Standard Liège in Stade Maurice Dufrasne. Eventually, the club finished second place in the group with five points and failed to advance for the semi-finals.

===2000s: Europe&#x27;s glory nights===
In 2000-01 season the club made a 3–2 (a.e.t) sensational win over Maccabi Haifa and reached the cup final for the first time in 49 years (fourth time overall), losing 3–0 to Maccabi Tel Aviv. 

The 2004–05 season marked the first time the club competed in UEFA Cup qualifiers after finishing third place of the league in the previous season. Maccabi began its way in the second qualifying round against Cyprus side AEK Larnaca, losing the first-leg 0–3 in GSP Stadium. Two weeks later, the club enjoyed a moment of glory in Europe, winning the second-leg 4–0 in Ramat Gan Stadium and advancing to the UEFA Cup first round after 4–3 on aggregate. However, the first-leg of the tie against Dutch side SC Heerenveen in Israel was cancelled by UEFA due to a baggage handlers strike, and the club lost the second-leg 5–0 (also on aggregate) in Abe Lenstra Stadion.

Maccabi&#x27;s most significant achievement of the decade came in the 2004–05 season when the club finished second in the league and reached the group stage of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup. In the second qualifying round the club defeated Macedonian side FK Baskimi 5–0 in Skopje stadium and 6–0 in Ramat Gan, advancing to the first round after 11–0 on aggregate. 

Maccabi entered as an unseeded team due to low coefficient rating (7.218), and drawn a seeded team such as Partizan Belgrade with much higher coefficient rating (30.012). The Serbian side won the first-leg 2–0 in Ramat Gan. Two weeks later, at the second-leg in Partizan Stadium, Maccabi made the impossible. In contrary to all assessments and expectations, with a lot off faith and ability above all, they won 5–2 and 5–4 on aggregate. In a sensational comeback with striker Omer Golan scoring a hat-trick (21&#x27;, 44&#x27;, 48&#x27;). 

The victory sent Maccabi to be a member of Group B, along with Palermo, Brøndby, Lokomotiv Moscow and Espanyol. However, these elite clubs proved to be too much for Maccabi to handle, and they lost all four of group stage matches, scoring just 1 goal while conceding 9.

===2020s: It&#x27;s been 72 years...===
After a defeat to Hapoel Beer Sheva in the 2020 cup final, the club reached the final again during the Israel State Cup campaign. Once more facing Hapoel Beer Sheva, the club managed to lift the trophy, securing their third cup win after 72-years drought.

<text>Walter John Buchanan (2 April 1890 – 20 October 1957) was a Scottish theatre and film actor, singer, dancer, producer and director. He was known for three decades as the embodiment of the debonair man-about-town in the tradition of George Grossmith Jr., and was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the last of the .&quot; He is best known in America for his role in the classic Hollywood musical &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; in 1953.

==Biography==
Buchanan was born in Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, the son of Walter John Buchanan Sr (1843–1902), auctioneer, and his wife, Patricia, &quot;née&quot;  McWatt (1860–1936). He was educated at the Glasgow Academy.

===Early career===
After a brief attempt to follow his late father&#x27;s profession and a failure at acting in Glasgow, he became a music hall comedian under the name of Chump Buchanan and appeared on the variety stage in Scotland. Moving to London and adopting the name &quot;Jack Buchanan&quot;, he first appeared on the West End in September 1912 in the comic opera &quot;The Grass Widow&quot;  at the Apollo Theatre. Hardship dogged him for a while before he became famous whilst on tour in 1915 in &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. He produced and acted in his own plays both in London and New York City. 

Buchanan&#x27;s health was not robust, and, to his regret, was declared unfit when he attempted to enlist for military service in the First World War. He appeared with some success in West End shows during the war, attracting favourable notices as a &quot;knut&quot; in the mould of George Grossmith Jr, and achieved front rank stardom in André Charlot&#x27;s 1921 revue &quot;A to Z&quot;, appearing with Gertrude Lawrence. Among his numbers in the show was Ivor Novello&#x27;s &quot;And Her Mother Came Too&quot;, which became Buchanan&#x27;s signature song. The show transferred successfully to Broadway in 1924. For the rest of the 1920s and 1930s he was famous for &quot;the seemingly lazy but most accomplished grace with which he sang, danced, flirted and joked his way through musical shows... The tall figure, the elegant gestures, the friendly drawling voice, the general air of having a good time.&quot; During the Second World War he starred in his own musical production &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Dance&quot;, whose cast included Fred Emney. The musical show was based on a book by Douglas Furber and L. Arthur Rose, and was staged at the Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, London. 

===Film career and later years===
He made his film debut in the silent cinema, in 1917 and appeared in about three dozen films in his career. In 1938, Buchanan achieved the unusual feat of starring in the London stage musical &quot;This&#x27;ll Make You Whistle&quot; while concurrently filming a film version. The film was released while the stage version was still running; thus the two productions competed with each other. Other starring roles included &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; (1930), &quot;Smash and Grab&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1939). He also produced several films including &quot;Happidrome&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1938), which he also directed. He continued to work on Broadway and the West End and took roles in several Hollywood musicals, including &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), his best-known film, in which he plays camp theatre director Jeffrey Cordova opposite Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. He suffered from spinal arthritis, though this did not stop him from performing several dance numbers with Astaire in &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;. 

==British stage career==
Buchanan&#x27;s British stage appearances included &quot;A to Z&quot;, &quot;Battling Butler&quot;, &quot;Toni&quot;, &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s a Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Stand up and Sing&quot;, &quot;Mr. Whittington&quot;, &quot;This&#x27;ll Make You Whistle&quot;, &quot;Top Hat and Tails&quot;, &quot;The Last of Mrs Cheyney&quot;, &quot;Fine Feathers&quot;, &quot;Canaries Sometimes Sing&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Listen, Ladies!&quot;, &quot;Castle in the Air&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;As Long as They&#x27;re Happy&quot;. His first pantomime appearance (Christmas, 1940) was as &quot;Buttons&quot; in &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

His productions included &quot;The Women&quot;, &quot;The Body was Well Nourished&quot;, &quot;Waltz Without End&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Dance&quot;, &quot;A Murder for a Valentine&quot;, &quot;Treble Trouble&quot; and &quot;The Lady Asks for Help&quot;.

==American stage career==
Buchanan&#x27;s American stage appearances included: André Charlot&#x27;s Revues, Charles B. Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Wake Up and Dream&quot;, &quot;Pardon My English&quot;, &quot;Between the Devil&quot; and &quot;Harvey&quot; (1948).

==Film career==
Buchanan&#x27;s Hollywood films included &quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929), &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953).

His British films included &quot;Yes, Mr Brown&quot; (1933), &quot;Goodnight, Vienna&quot; (1932), &quot;That&#x27;s a Good Girl&quot; (1933), &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1935), &quot;Come Out of the Pantry&quot; (1935), &quot;When Knights Were Bold&quot; (1936), &quot;This&#x27;ll Make You Whistle&quot; (1936), &quot;Smash and Grab&quot; (1937), &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1938), &quot;Break the News&quot; (1938), &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1939), &quot;The Middle Watch&quot; (1940), &quot;Bulldog Sees It Through&quot; (1940), &quot;As Long as They&#x27;re Happy&quot; (1955) and &quot;Josephine and Men&quot; (1955). He made one French film (bilingual), &quot;The Diary of Major Thompson&quot; (1955).

==Radio and television==
Buchanan was a frequent broadcaster on British radio, especially during the Second World War. Programmes included &quot;The Jack Buchanan Show&quot; and, in 1955, the hugely popular eight-part series &quot;Man About Town&quot;.

On 12 June 1928, Buchanan participated in the first-ever transatlantic television broadcast. It was conducted by Scottish engineer John Logie Baird, an important figure in the technological development of television, and a lifelong friend of Buchanan&#x27;s. At the time, the few television sets that existed had been custom-built by engineers and were not available for purchase by the general public in the United Kingdom or the United States.

American television shows on which Buchanan appeared during the era of stores selling television sets included &quot;Max Liebman&#x27;s Spotlight&quot; in 1954 and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

==Business interests==
In a British tradition of actor-management, Buchanan frequently produced his own shows, many of which were premiered in the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow. He was also heavily involved in the more commercial side of British show business. He was responsible, with partners, for the building and ownership of the Leicester Square Theatre, London, and the Imperial in Brighton. He also controlled the Garrick Theatre in the West End of London and the King&#x27;s Theatre in Hammersmith. Jack Buchanan Productions (in which his partners were J. Arthur Rank and Charles Woolf) owned Riverside Studios in Hammersmith.

He had been at school with the pioneer of television John Logie Baird and with him co-owned Television Limited, which manufactured and rented televisions.

Not all his business ventures were profitable, and at his death his estate was valued for probate (in 1958) at £24,489 (equivalent to £ today).

==Marriage==
Buchanan&#x27;s image was that of the raffish eternal bachelor, but he was, unknown to most, married to Russian opera singer Saffo Buchanan, née Drageva (known professionally as Saffo Arnav) from 1915 to 1920, when the marriage was annulled.

Later in life, he married Susan Bassett, an American, in 1947; he was her second husband. Through her he had a stepdaughter, Theo, who lived with them. He had no children of his own.

He once had a relationship with Australian actress Coral Browne, and during her meeting in Moscow with Soviet spy Guy Burgess in the late 1950s she informed Burgess, on mentioning Buchanan, that &quot;we almost got married&#x27;. &quot;And...?&quot; &quot;He jilted me.&quot; Burgess, previously at the British Foreign Office, had defected to Moscow a few years earlier, and one of the few mementoes of his earlier life that he had been able to keep was one 78rpm Jack Buchanan record—&quot;Who?&quot;—which, when Browne visited his Moscow flat, he played repeatedly. This event is portrayed in Alan Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot;. 

==Character==
Buchanan was noted for his portrayals of the quintessential English gentleman, despite being a Scot. He was known for his financial generosity to less prosperous actors and chorus performers. Sandy Wilson recalled that each year during the running of the annual Grand National horse race, Buchanan would cancel that day&#x27;s performance of his current musical and charter an excursion train to the racecourse and back, supplying meals for the entire cast and crew of his show, in addition to giving them £5 each for a &quot;flutter&quot; on the horse of their choice. 

Buchanan died in London on October 20, 1957 from spinal cancer at age 66.

<text>The Monuments to the Warsaw Uprising were first established in Warsaw in the 1970s. Prior to that, there were only monuments to the Red Army soldiers and the Armia Ludowa soldiers. The role of the latter in the city fights in 1944 was exaggerated and overrated. Most of the victims of the Uprising who were buried in graves all over the city were later exhumed and buried in mass graves far away from the city centre, with a small concrete monument to &quot;the victims of the war with Nazism&quot;. No mention of the Uprising was allowed.

Despite communist efforts, the people of Warsaw did not forget the Uprising. The only way to express it was on Polish zaduszki day, when thousands of people lit candles on graves of the Armia Krajowa soldiers in Powązki cemetery. According to the Polish secret police, in 1983 more than 400,000 people attended the informal feast. In 1979, the first (unofficial) celebration of Warsaw Uprising anniversary took place.


In the 1970s, the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party under the lead of Edward Gierek started to seek a &quot;Polish way to socialism&quot; and allowed for some liberalization of Polish history. The official propaganda started to underline that although the commanders of the Armia Krajowa were criminals, the individual soldiers simply followed wrong orders. In Warsaw, some 500 stone tablets were erected to commemorate those who fell in the city during the war. The tablets were all identical, except for the dates and number of victims. The text under the monuments says: &quot;This place is sanctified with the blood of Poles who fell in fight for the freedom of the Motherland&quot;. Still no mention of the Uprising was allowed in public places.

Also, a monument to the engineers of the Soviet-backed 1st Polish Army who crossed the river in late September and tried to help the Uprising was erected in Powiśle area. However, there was no text explaining when or what for did they die. The text written on the tables around the statue of an engineer said &quot;The Free Warsaw will never forget those who started the great effort of its reconstruction (...) to the engineers who lost their lives on duty.&quot;.

In 1980, the start of the Solidarity movement allowed for a committee to be created, whose purpose was to erect a monument of the Warsaw Uprising. The money was to be gathered from private sponsors since the party still did not want to participate in such an initiative. Many prominent members of the Solidarity joined the committee, but it was banned after the Martial Law was imposed in 1981. However, the communist authorities understood that the memory of the Uprising will not fade in peoples&#x27; minds and agreed to prepare a project of the monument. On July 20, 1984, an erection act was prepared. The date was chosen to blur the connection with the uprising and the feast was officially connected to July 22, the anniversary of signing the PKWN manifesto. No Armia Krajowa members were invited and the construction never started.
After the peaceful dissolution of communist system in Poland in 1989, the committee was recreated. The project by Jacek Budyna was already prepared and construction begun immediately. The Warsaw Uprising Monument (&quot;Pomnik Powstania Warszawskiego&quot;) was erected on Krasiński Square, close to the place where one of the sewer communication lines with Starówka, Żoliborz and the city centre was located. The monument was revealed on August 1, 1989.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the monuments to the soldiers who fought in the battle were no longer banned and started to spread throughout the city. Nowadays every battalion who took part in the struggle has got a monument, a street or a square named after.

<text>In algebra, a split-complex number (or hyperbolic number, also perplex number, double number) is based on a hyperbolic unit satisfying formula_1, where formula_2. A split-complex number has two real number components and , and is written formula_3 The &quot;conjugate&quot; of is formula_4 Since formula_5 the product of a number with its conjugate is formula_6 an isotropic quadratic form.

The collection of all split-complex numbers formula_7 for forms an algebra over the field of real numbers. Two split-complex numbers and have a product that satisfies formula_8 This composition of over the algebra product makes a composition algebra.

A similar algebra based on and component-wise operations of addition and multiplication, where is the quadratic form on also forms a quadratic space. The ring isomorphism

formula_9

relates proportional quadratic forms, but the mapping is an isometry since the multiplicative identity of is at a distance from 0, which is normalized in .

Split-complex numbers have many other names; see &quot;&quot; below. See the article &quot;Motor variable&quot; for functions of a split-complex number.

==Definition==
A split-complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers, written in the form

formula_10

where and are real numbers and the hyperbolic unit satisfies

formula_11

In the field of complex numbers the imaginary unit i satisfies formula_12 The change of sign distinguishes the split-complex numbers from the ordinary complex ones. The hyperbolic unit is &quot;not&quot; a real number but an independent quantity.

The collection of all such is called the split-complex plane. Addition and multiplication of split-complex numbers are defined by

formula_13

This multiplication is commutative, associative and distributes over addition.

===Conjugate, modulus, and bilinear form===
Just as for complex numbers, one can define the notion of a split-complex conjugate. If

formula_14

then the conjugate of is defined as

formula_15

The conjugate is an involution which satisfies similar properties to the complex conjugate. Namely,

formula_16

The squared modulus of a split-complex number formula_17 is given by the isotropic quadratic form

formula_18

It has the composition algebra property:

formula_19

However, this quadratic form is not positive-definite but rather has signature , so the modulus is &quot;not&quot; a norm.

The associated bilinear form is given by

formula_20

where formula_17 and formula_22 Here, the &quot;real part&quot; is defined by formula_23. Another expression for the squared modulus is then

formula_24

Since it is not positive-definite, this bilinear form is not an inner product; nevertheless the bilinear form is frequently referred to as an &quot;indefinite inner product&quot;. A similar abuse of language refers to the modulus as a norm.

A split-complex number is invertible if and only if its modulus is nonzero thus numbers of the form have no inverse. The multiplicative inverse of an invertible element is given by

formula_25

Split-complex numbers which are not invertible are called null vectors. These are all of the form for some real number .

===The diagonal basis===
There are two nontrivial idempotent elements given by formula_26 and formula_27 Idempotency means that formula_28 and formula_29 Both of these elements are null:

formula_30

It is often convenient to use and ∗ as an alternate basis for the split-complex plane. This basis is called the diagonal basis or null basis. The split-complex number can be written in the null basis as

formula_31

If we denote the number formula_32 for real numbers and by , then split-complex multiplication is given by

formula_33

The split-complex conjugate in the diagonal basis is given by
formula_34
and the squared modulus by

formula_35

===Isomorphism===
On the basis {e, e*} it becomes clear that the split-complex numbers are ring-isomorphic to the direct sum with addition and multiplication defined pairwise.

The diagonal basis for the split-complex number plane can be invoked by using an ordered pair for formula_36 and making the mapping

formula_37

Now the quadratic form is formula_38 Furthermore,

formula_39

so the two parametrized hyperbolas are brought into correspondence with .

The action of hyperbolic versor formula_40 then corresponds under this linear transformation to a squeeze mapping

formula_41

Though lying in the same isomorphism class in the category of rings, the split-complex plane and the direct sum of two real lines differ in their layout in the Cartesian plane. The isomorphism, as a planar mapping, consists of a counter-clockwise rotation by 45° and a dilation by . The dilation in particular has sometimes caused confusion in connection with areas of a hyperbolic sector. Indeed, hyperbolic angle corresponds to area of a sector in the plane with its &quot;unit circle&quot; given by formula_42 The contracted unit hyperbola formula_43 of the split-complex plane has only &quot;half the area&quot; in the span of a corresponding hyperbolic sector. Such confusion may be perpetuated when the geometry of the split-complex plane is not distinguished from that of .

==Geometry==

A two-dimensional real vector space with the Minkowski inner product is called -dimensional Minkowski space, often denoted Just as much of the geometry of the Euclidean plane can be described with complex numbers, the geometry of the Minkowski plane can be described with split-complex numbers.

The set of points

formula_44

is a hyperbola for every nonzero in The hyperbola consists of a right and left branch passing through and . The case is called the unit hyperbola. The conjugate hyperbola is given by

formula_45

with an upper and lower branch passing through and . The hyperbola and conjugate hyperbola are separated by two diagonal asymptotes which form the set of null elements:

formula_46

These two lines (sometimes called the null cone) are perpendicular in and have slopes ±1.

Split-complex numbers and are said to be hyperbolic-orthogonal if . While analogous to ordinary orthogonality, particularly as it is known with ordinary complex number arithmetic, this condition is more subtle. It forms the basis for the simultaneous hyperplane concept in spacetime.

The analogue of Euler&#x27;s formula for the split-complex numbers is

formula_47

This formula can be derived from a power series expansion using the fact that cosh has only even powers while that for sinh has odd powers. For all real values of the hyperbolic angle the split-complex number has norm 1 and lies on the right branch of the unit hyperbola. Numbers such as have been called hyperbolic versors.

Since has modulus 1, multiplying any split-complex number by preserves the modulus of and represents a &quot;hyperbolic rotation&quot; (also called a Lorentz boost or a squeeze mapping). Multiplying by preserves the geometric structure, taking hyperbolas to themselves and the null cone to itself.

The set of all transformations of the split-complex plane which preserve the modulus (or equivalently, the inner product) forms a group called the generalized orthogonal group . This group consists of the hyperbolic rotations, which form a subgroup denoted , combined with four discrete reflections given by

formula_48 and formula_49

The exponential map

formula_50

sending to rotation by is a group isomorphism since the usual exponential formula applies:

formula_51

If a split-complex number does not lie on one of the diagonals, then has a polar decomposition.

==Algebraic properties==
In abstract algebra terms, the split-complex numbers can be described as the quotient of the polynomial ring by the ideal generated by the polynomial formula_52

formula_53

The image of in the quotient is the &quot;imaginary&quot; unit . With this description, it is clear that the split-complex numbers form a commutative algebra over the real numbers. The algebra is &quot;not&quot; a field since the null elements are not invertible. All of the nonzero null elements are zero divisors.

Since addition and multiplication are continuous operations with respect to the usual topology of the plane, the split-complex numbers form a topological ring.

The algebra of split-complex numbers forms a composition algebra since

formula_54

for any numbers and .

From the definition it is apparent that the ring of split-complex numbers is isomorphic to the group ring of the cyclic group over the real numbers 

Elements of the identity component in the group of units in D have four square roots.: say formula_55 are square roots of &quot;p&quot;. Further, formula_56 are also square roots of &quot;p&quot;.

The idempotents formula_57 are their own square roots, and the square root of formula_58

==Matrix representations==
One can easily represent split-complex numbers by matrices. The split-complex number formula_36 can be represented by the matrix formula_60

Addition and multiplication of split-complex numbers are then given by matrix addition and multiplication. The squared modulus of is given by the determinant of the corresponding matrix.

In fact there are many representations of the split-complex plane in the four-dimensional ring of 2x2 real matrices. The real multiples of the identity matrix form a real line in the matrix ring M(2,R). Any hyperbolic unit &quot;m&quot; provides a basis element with which to extend the real line to the split-complex plane. The matrices

formula_61

which square to the identity matrix satisfy formula_62
For example, when &quot;a&quot; = 0, then (&quot;b,c&quot;) is a point on the standard hyperbola. More generally, there is a hypersurface in M(2,R) of hyperbolic units, any one of which serves in a basis to represent the split-complex numbers as a subring of M(2,R).

The number formula_36 can be represented by the matrix  formula_64

==History==
The use of split-complex numbers dates back to 1848 when James Cockle revealed his tessarines. William Kingdon Clifford used split-complex numbers to represent sums of spins. Clifford introduced the use of split-complex numbers as coefficients in a quaternion algebra now called split-biquaternions. He called its elements &quot;motors&quot;, a term in parallel with the &quot;rotor&quot; action of an ordinary complex number taken from the circle group. Extending the analogy, functions of a motor variable contrast to functions of an ordinary complex variable.

Since the late twentieth century, the split-complex multiplication has commonly been seen as a Lorentz boost of a spacetime plane. In that model, the number represents an event in a spatio-temporal plane, where &quot;x&quot; is measured in seconds and in light-seconds. The future corresponds to the quadrant of events , which has the split-complex polar decomposition formula_65. The model says that can be reached from the origin by entering a frame of reference of rapidity and waiting nanoseconds. The split-complex equation

formula_66

expressing products on the unit hyperbola illustrates the additivity of rapidities for collinear velocities. Simultaneity of events depends on rapidity ;

formula_67

is the line of events simultaneous with the origin in the frame of reference with rapidity &quot;a&quot;.

Two events and are hyperbolic-orthogonal when formula_68 Canonical events and are hyperbolic orthogonal and lie on the axes of a frame of reference in which the events simultaneous with the origin are proportional to .

In 1933 Max Zorn was using the split-octonions and noted the composition algebra property. He realized that the Cayley–Dickson construction, used to generate division algebras, could be modified (with a factor gamma, ) to construct other composition algebras including the split-octonions. His innovation was perpetuated by Adrian Albert, Richard D. Schafer, and others. The gamma factor, with as base field, builds split-complex numbers as a composition algebra. Reviewing Albert for Mathematical Reviews, N. H. McCoy wrote that there was an &quot;introduction of some new algebras of order 2e over &quot;F&quot; generalizing Cayley–Dickson algebras.&quot; Taking and corresponds to the algebra of this article.

In 1935 J.C. Vignaux and A. Durañona y Vedia developed the split-complex geometric algebra and function theory in four articles in &quot;Contribución a las Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas&quot;, National University of La Plata, República Argentina (in Spanish). These expository and pedagogical essays presented the subject for broad appreciation.

In 1941 E.F. Allen used the split-complex geometric arithmetic to establish the nine-point hyperbola of a triangle inscribed in .

In 1956 Mieczyslaw Warmus published &quot;Calculus of Approximations&quot; in &quot;Bulletin de l’Académie polonaise des sciences&quot; (see link in References). He developed two algebraic systems, each of which he called &quot;approximate numbers&quot;, the second of which forms a real algebra. D. H. Lehmer reviewed the article in Mathematical Reviews and observed that this second system was isomorphic to the &quot;hyperbolic complex&quot; numbers, the subject of this article.

In 1961 Warmus continued his exposition, referring to the components of an approximate number as midpoint and radius of the interval denoted.

<text>The Northern Renaissance was the Renaissance that occurred in Europe north of the Alps. From the last years of the 15th century, its Renaissance spread around Europe. Called the Northern Renaissance because it occurred north of the Italian Renaissance, this period became the German, French, English, Low Countries and Polish Renaissances, and in turn created other national and localized movements, each with different attributes.

In France, King Francis I imported Italian art, commissioned Italian artists (including Leonardo da Vinci), and built grand palaces at great expense, starting the French Renaissance. This included not only the then Kingdom of France but also the adjacent Duchy of Burgundy. Trade and commerce in then Burgundian cities like Bruges in the 15th century and Antwerp in the 16th increased cultural exchange between Italy and the Low Countries; however in art, and especially architecture, late Gothic influences remained present until the arrival of Baroque even as painters increasingly drew on Italian models.

Universities and the printed book helped spread the spirit of the age through France, the Low Countries and the Holy Roman Empire, and then to Scandinavia and Britain in the early 16th century – a process halted by the religious schism caused by Henry VIII who had earlier extensively employed Italian artisans at Nonsuch Palace and Hampton Court under Thomas Wolsey. Writers and humanists such as Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard and Desiderius Erasmus were greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance model and were part of the same intellectual movement. During the English Renaissance (which overlapped with the Elizabethan era) writers such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe composed works of lasting influence. The Renaissance was brought to Poland directly from Italy by artists from Florence and the Low Countries, starting the Polish Renaissance.

In some areas the Northern Renaissance was distinct from the Italian Renaissance in its centralization of political power. While Italy and Germany were dominated by independent city-states, most of Europe began emerging as nation-states or even unions of countries. The Northern Renaissance was also closely linked to the Protestant Reformation with the resulting long series of internal and external conflicts between various Protestant groups and the Roman Catholic Church having lasting effects.

==Overview==
Feudalism was on the decline at the beginning of the Renaissance. The reasons for this decline include the post-Plague environment, the increasing use of money rather than land as a medium of exchange, the growing number of serfs living as freemen, the formation of nation-states with monarchies interested in reducing the power of feudal lords, the increasing uselessness of feudal armies in the face of new military technology (such as gunpowder), and a general increase in agricultural productivity due to improving farming technology and methods. As in Italy, the decline of feudalism opened the way for the cultural, social, and economic changes associated with the Renaissance in Europe.
Finally, the Renaissance in Europe would also be kindled by a weakening of the Roman Catholic Church. The slow demise of feudalism also weakened a long-established policy in which church officials helped keep the population of the manor under control in return for tribute. Consequently, the early 15th century saw the rise of many secular institutions and beliefs. Among the most significant of these, Renaissance humanism would lay the philosophical grounds for much of Renaissance art, music, science and technology. Erasmus, for example, was important in spreading humanist ideas in the north, and was a central figure at the intersection of classical humanism and mounting religious questions. Forms of artistic expression which a century ago would have been banned by the church were now tolerated or even encouraged in certain circles.

The velocity of transmission of the Renaissance throughout Europe can also be ascribed to the invention of the printing press. Its power to disseminate information enhanced scientific research, spread political ideas and generally impacted the course of the Renaissance in northern Europe. As in Italy, the printing press increased the availability of books written in both vernacular languages and the publication of new and ancient classical texts in Greek and Latin. Furthermore, the Bible became widely available in translation, a factor often attributed to the spread of the Protestant Reformation.

==Age of Discovery==

One of the most important technological development of the Renaissance was the invention of the caravel. This combination of European and North African ship building technologies for the first time made extensive trade and travel over the Atlantic feasible. While first introduced by the Italian states and the early captains, such as Giovanni Caboto, Giovanni da Verrazzano and Columbus, who were Italian explorers, the development would end Northern Italy&#x27;s role as the trade crossroads of Europe, shifting wealth and power westwards to Portugal, Spain, France, England, and the Netherlands. These states all began to conduct extensive trade with Africa and Asia, and in the Americas began extensive colonisation activities. This period of exploration and expansion has become known as the Age of Discovery. Eventually European power spread around the globe.

==Painting and sculpture==

 Early Netherlandish painting often included complicated iconography, and art historians have debated the &quot;hidden symbolism&quot; of works by artists like Hubert and Jan van Eyck.

The detailed realism of Early Netherlandish painting, led by Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the 1420s and 1430s, is today generally considered to be the beginning of the early Northern Renaissance in painting. This detailed realism was greatly respected in Italy, but there was little reciprocal influence on the North until nearly the end of the 15th century. Despite frequent cultural and artistic exchange, the Antwerp Mannerists (1500–1530)—chronologically overlapping with but unrelated to Italian Mannerism—were among the first artists in the Low Countries to clearly reflect Italian formal developments. 

Around the same time, Albrecht Dürer made his two trips to Italy, where he was greatly admired for his prints. Dürer, in turn, was influenced by the art he saw there and is agreed to be one of the first Northern High Renaissance painters. Other notable northern painters such as Hans Holbein the Elder and Jean Fouquet, retained a Gothic influence that was still popular in the north, while highly individualistic artists such as Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder developed styles that were imitated by many subsequent generations. Later in the 16th century Northern painters increasingly looked and travelled to Rome, becoming known as the Romanists. The High Renaissance art of Michelangelo and Raphael and the late Renaissance stylistic tendencies of Mannerism that were in vogue had a great impact on their work.

Renaissance humanism and the large number of surviving classical artworks and monuments encouraged many Italian painters to explore Greco-Roman themes more prominently than northern artists, and likewise the famous 15th-century German and Dutch paintings tend to be religious. In the 16th century, mythological and other themes from history became more uniform amongst northern and Italian artists. Northern Renaissance painters, however, had new subject matter, such as landscape and genre painting. 
As Renaissance art styles moved through northern Europe, they changed and were adapted to local customs. In England and the northern Netherlands the Reformation brought religious painting almost completely to an end. Despite several very talented artists of the Tudor Court in England, portrait painting was slow to spread from the elite. In France the School of Fontainebleau was begun by Italians such as Rosso Fiorentino in the latest Mannerist style, but succeeded in establishing a durable national style. By the end of the 16th century, artists such as Karel van Mander and Hendrik Goltzius collected in Haarlem in a brief but intense phase of Northern Mannerism that also spread to Flanders.

<text>Didelphodon (from [&quot;is&quot;] &quot;opossum&quot; tooth &quot;tooth&quot;) is a genus of extinct metatherian mammal from the Late Cretaceous of North America.

==Description==
Although perhaps little larger than a Virginia opossum, with a skull length of and a weight of , the teeth have specialized bladelike cusps and carnassial notches, indicating that the animal was a predator; the jaws are short and massive and bear enormous, bulbous premolar teeth which appear to have been used for crushing. Analyses of a near-complete skull referred to &quot;Didelphodon&quot; show that it had an unusually high bite force quotient (i.e. bite force relative to body size) among Mesozoic mammals, suggesting a durophagous diet. However, its skull lacks the vaulted forehead of hyenas and other specialized bone-eating durophagous mammals, indicating that its diet was perhaps a mixture of hard foodstuffs (e.g. snails, bones) alongside small vertebrates and carrion; although omnivorous habits were suggested in the past, it appears that it was incapable of processing plant matter, rendering it more likely to be hypercarnivorous or durophagous. Some convergence with the carnassials of other predatory mammal groups has also been noted.

==Discovery==
Three species of &quot;Didelphodon&quot; are known: &quot;D. vorax&quot;, &quot;D. padanicus&quot;, and &quot;D. coyi&quot;. The genus is known from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana and the Lance Formation of Wyoming, the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, and the Scollard Formation of Alberta, where it is one of the most abundant mammals. It is found solely in late Maastrichtian deposits.

==Classification==
&quot;Didelphodon&quot; is a stagodontid marsupial related to &quot;Eodelphis&quot; and &quot;Pariadens&quot;. The genus appears to descend from the Campanian &quot;Eodelphis&quot;, and in particular appears to be related to &quot;Eodelphis cutleri&quot;. &quot;Pariadens&quot; appears to be more primitive than either &quot;Eodelphis&quot; or &quot;Didelphodon&quot;, and is probably sister to their group. Didelphimorphia is an order that was named in 1872 by Gill. Previously, in 1821, Gray named the superfamily Didelphoidea to house the families Alphadontidae, Pediomyidae, Peradectidae, and Stagodontidae, which unites &quot;Didelphodon&quot; with many other genera.
 In 2006, a study found that the stagodontids only contained two taxa, &quot;Didelphodon&quot; and &quot;Eodelphis&quot;. The previously-included &quot;Pariadens&quot; was excluded from the group because its type species, &quot;P. kirklandi&quot;, lacks any of the clade&#x27;s characteristics; it was reassigned to Marsupialia &quot;incertae sedis&quot;. Another species, &quot;P.&quot; &quot;mckennai&quot; lacks marsupial features, and is probably a therian. Another historical stagodontid, &quot;Boreodon&quot;, is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. Finally, the purported stagodontid &quot;Delphodon&quot; is probably a synonym of &quot;Pediomys&quot; or &quot;Alphadon&quot;.

A 2016 phylogenetic analysis found that &quot;Didelphodon&quot; and other stagodontids were marsupialiforms. Their relationships within the Marsupialiformes are shown below.
==Paleobiology==

Although it has been argued on the basis of the shape of referred tarsal bones that &quot;Didelphodon&quot; and other stagodontids were semiaquatic due to having flexible feet, these traits may in fact be evidence of increased rigidity in the foot. Nevertheless, a recently-found and as-of-yet undescribed specimen, located just away from a &quot;Triceratops&quot; in a riverbed, suggests that &quot;Didelphodon&quot; may have possessed an otter-like body with a tasmanian devil-like skull. A study that is being prepared by Kraig Derstler, Greg Wilson, Robert Bakker, Ray Vodden and Mike Triebold will describe this new specimen, housed in the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center. A study on Mesozoic mammal locomotion demonstrates that &quot;Didelphodon&quot; groups with semi-aquatic species.

The evolution of &quot;Didelphodon&quot; and other large stagodontids (as well as large deltatheroidans like &quot;Nanocuris&quot;) occurs after the local extinction of eutriconodont mammals, suggesting passive or direct ecological replacement. Given that all insectivorous and carnivorous mammal groups suffered heavy losses during the mid-Cretaceous, it seems likely these metatherians simply occupied niches left after the extinction of most eutriconodonts.

<doc id="893579" wikidata="Q7268660" url="?curid=893579" title="Qualified teacher status">
<text>Qualified teacher status (QTS) or Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills status (QTLS) is required in England and Wales to work as a teacher of children in state schools under local authority control, and in special education schools. QTS is not required at academies, free schools or independent schools. A similar status exists under a different name in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

==Gaining QTS or QTLS==
An undergraduate degree and successful completion of a teacher training programme is compulsory for QTS recommendation. One of the main routes to achieving QTS, for those already in possession of a degree, involves undertaking a postgraduate teacher training course, such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Education or a School Direct programme. The Diploma in Education and Training leads to QTLS. There are also some undergraduate degree qualifications leading to QTS, such as the Bachelor of Education. In England only, candidates must also pass professional skills tests. All candidates must have GCSEs at grade C or above in English and mathematics, and prospective primary teachers must also be in possession of (usually) a grade C in a science subject before embarking on teacher training.

All training which leads to qualified teacher status requires trainees to train across at least two key consecutive pupil age ranges, as defined in the Secretary of State&#x27;s Requirements for Initial Teacher Training. The age ranges are:

*Ages 3–5 (Early years foundation stage)
*Ages 5–7 (School years 1 and 2) 
*Ages 7–9 (School years 3 and 4)
*Ages 9–11 (School years 5 and 6)
*Ages 11–14 (School years 7 to 9) 
*Ages 14–16 (School years 10 and 11)
*Ages 16–19 (School years 12 and 13)

The Teaching Regulation Agency in England and Education Workforce Council in Wales, maintain all registrations, as well as issuing QTS certificates.

QTS is technically recognised only in the country it was awarded (England or Wales), but teachers can normally apply for QTS in other home countries relatively easily. QTS gained in England is automatically recognized in Wales and vice versa. QTS is also recognised by many other countries once the relevant paperwork has been completed, though many countries place a lot of importance on the route to QTS (such as requiring a PGCE, whilst not accepting the GTP). Teachers trained outside England and Wales must also apply to be awarded QTS if they wish to teach in these countries.

After having been awarded QTS teachers must normally still pass an induction period (previously called &#x27;probation&#x27;) – normally their first year of teaching. Teachers who have gained QTS but have not yet completed the Induction period are known as NQTs. NQTs who fail the induction still retain their QTS, but cannot teach in state-run schools. The induction period normally lasts a year (three school terms).

===Routes to QTS or QTLS===
Numerous qualifications and courses can lead to QTS or QTLS:

====Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)====

The PGCE is a one-year course designed for individuals holding existing degrees, serving as the most common postgraduate pathway into teaching. It is hosted and overseen by a university or other higher education institution, with students dedicating a significant portion of the program to practical experience in placement schools. Additionally, completing the PGCE earns credits towards a master&#x27;s degree.

====Diploma in Education and Training (DET)====
The DET is a Level 5 Diploma in Education and Training, comprising a one-year, 120-credit initial teacher training programme granted by a university or an accrediting body like the Learning Resource Network (LRN). Graduates of the DET can seek QTLS accreditation from the Society for Education and Training.

====School-Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)====

A SCITT programme allows graduates to undergo their training within a school setting, resulting in QTS. Some SCITT programmes also confer a PGCE qualification. This option is exclusively available in England.

==== Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) ====

The GTP enables candidates to gain QTS while they are employed as an unqualified teacher in a school.

Both the graduate and registered teacher programmes (GTP and RTP) have been closed in England. The GTP has been replaced by the School Direct Training Programme (salaried).

====Undergraduate QTS routes====
Students can enrol in a three or four-year undergraduate degree course that includes QTS. This allows candidates to obtain their QTS while studying for their degree, with teaching practice conducted throughout the entire programme. These programmes typically award Bachelor of Education (BEd) degrees, although some may offer Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees.

==Scotland and Northern Ireland==
QTS as such does not exist in Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, as is the case in England and Wales, all teachers in Scotland and Northern Ireland are required to register with either the General Teaching Council for Scotland or the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland; the General Teaching Councils will consider only graduates with teaching qualifications (such as a BEd, PGCE or PGDE) for registration.

In Northern Ireland, a one-year Induction programme (equivalent to the NQT programme in England and Wales) must be completed.

Individuals in Scotland must complete a one-year probation period, which is equivalent to induction in England and Wales.

Those holding English or Welsh QTS (or an equivalent from another country) must apply for registration with the relevant General Teaching Council. The relevant General Teaching Council considers each case individually; even those with English or Welsh QTS are not guaranteed permission to teach in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

== Schools not requiring QTS for teachers ==

There is no formal requirement for teachers at independent schools or free schools to have QTS.

As of 27 July 2012, there is no longer any requirement for teaching staff in academies to have QTS.

<text>The Kahan Commission (ועדת כהן), formally known as the Commission of Inquiry into the Events at the Refugee Camps in Beirut, was established by the Israeli government on 28 September 1982, to investigate the Sabra and Shatila massacre (16–18 September 1982). The Kahan Commission was chaired by the president of the Supreme Court, Yitzhak Kahan. Its other two members were Supreme Court Judge Aharon Barak, and Major general (res.) Yona Efrat. The Commission was to make recommendations on Israeli involvement in the massacre through an investigation of:

Following a four-month investigation, on 8 February 1983, the Kahan Commission submitted its report, which was released to the public by spokesman Bezalel Gordon simultaneously in Hebrew and English. It concluded that &quot;direct responsibility&quot; rested with the Gemayel Phalangists led by Fadi Frem, and that no Israelis were deemed &quot;directly responsible&quot;, although Israel was held to be &quot;indirectly responsible&quot;.

The Defence minister Ariel Sharon was found to bear &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for &quot;ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge&quot; and &quot;not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed&quot;. Sharon&#x27;s negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a &quot;non-fulfillment of a duty with which the Defence Minister was charged&quot;, and it was recommended that Sharon be dismissed as Defence Minister.

Initially, Sharon refused to resign, and Prime Minister Menachem Begin refused to fire him. However, following a peace march against the government, as the marchers were dispersing, a grenade was thrown into the crowd, killing Emil Grunzweig, a reserve combat officer and peace activist, and wounding half a dozen others, including the son of the Interior Minister. Although Sharon resigned as Defence Minister, he remained in the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. Years later, Sharon would be elected Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister.

The Commission arrived to similar conclusions with respect to Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Rafael Eitan (&quot;tantamount to a breach of duty that was incumbent upon the Chief of Staff&quot;), as well as Director of Military Intelligence, Major general Yehoshua Saguy, and other Intelligence officials — though the Mossad was not reprimanded and parts of the report commenting on its role remain under military censorship.

Critics of the Commission point to its limited scope, some of whom argue it amounted to a whitewash. The final paragraph of the report anticipated such reaction: &quot;We do not deceive ourselves that the results of this inquiry will convince or satisfy those who have prejudices or selective consciences, but this inquiry was not intended for such people. We have striven and have spared no effort to arrive at the truth, and we hope that all persons of good will who will examine the issue without prejudice will be convinced that the inquiry was conducted without any bias.&quot;

Israel&#x27;s standing in the international community, which had sunk to an all-time low in the wake of the massacre, rebounded following the publication of the report. Israel was praised from many quarters for having investigated itself and punishing senior members of its government. Richard Falk noted that the &quot;sincere and careful&quot; report was &quot;much more devastating in its impact on the evaluation of state leadership during the Lebanon War than any self-scrutiny that the American government allowed during the Vietnam War.&quot;

<doc id="893588" wikidata="Q2450856" url="?curid=893588" title="Harald Wartooth">
<text>Harald Wartooth or &quot;Harold Hiltertooth&quot; (Old Norse: &quot;Haraldr hilditǫnn&quot;; Modern Swedish and Danish: Harald Hildetand; Modern Norwegian: &quot;Harald Hildetann&quot;) was a semi-legendary king of Denmark who is mentioned in several traditional sources. He is held to have (indirectly) succeeded his father as king of Zealand and to have expanded his realm. According to different sources, he may have ruled over Jutland, part of Sweden and the historical northern German province of Wendland. He is said to have been finally defeated and killed at the legendary Battle of Bråvalla.

==Name==
Saxo Grammaticus, in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, gives two different accounts about why Harald had the name &quot;wartooth&quot;. According to one tradition, it was due to Harald having lost two of his teeth in battle against Veseti, the lord of Scania, after which two new teeth grew out. Saxo further tells that according to another opinion, the name was derived from Harald having protruding teeth. A scholarly view, however, holds the name to be derived from a name for &quot;war hero&quot;.

==Sources==
Harald Wartooth is stated by most texts to have flourished three generations before the conquest of part of England by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok (860s-870s). This would place him around the late 8th century, though the genealogy linking him with Viking Age rulers is dubious. However, the sources that mention him are quite late. The most detailed text is Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s chronicle &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (c. 1200) which is however complicated by the flow of Danish-patriotic rhetoric, in part a reflection of the Valdemarian age of military expansion. An Icelandic text &quot;Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot; (Fragment of a saga about some ancient kings, 13th century) provides brief details about his life and a fuller account of his dramatic demise. Shorter accounts are found in the &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot; (13th century), &quot;Lejrekroniken&quot; (12th century), &quot;The Saga of Herraud and Bose&quot;, and others. A lay about the Bråvalla battle, seemingly written by a Norwegian skald in the 11th century, may once have existed, forming the basis for the extended saga accounts. By far the oldest reference to Harald is a praise poem by Einarr Helgason from c. 980, where the current Danish ruler Harald Bluetooth is likened with &quot;Hilditann&quot;, implying that the older Harald was seen as a prestigious forebear of his younger namesake. There is moreover a song in the Poetic Edda, &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot; (12th century) which describes Harald&#x27;s descent from Ivar Vidfamne.

==Family==
Most sources describe him as the son of Ivar Vidfamne&#x27;s daughter Auðr the Deep-Minded (but &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; calls her Alfhild). According to &quot;Sögubrot&quot;, &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot; and the &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot;, Harald was the son of Hrœrekr Ringslinger (slöngvanbaugi), the king of Zealand. &quot;Sögubrot&quot; relates that his mother later married Raðbarðr, the king of Garðaríki and they had the son Randver. However, according to &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, both Harald and Randver were the sons of Valdar and Alfhild. &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot; adds that Harald had the son Þrándr the Old (hinn gamli) who was the ancestor of one of the characters in the saga. &quot;Sögubrot&quot; also mentions that he had a son named Þrándr the Old (gamli), but also adds a second son, Hrœrekr Ringslinger (slöngvandbaugi), who apparently was named exactly like his grandfather. Another son, Eysteinn Illruler is mentioned by &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;; he later became a king of Sweden. &quot;Landnámabók&quot; informs that Hrœrekr Ringslinger the younger had a son named Þórólfr (Thorolfur) &quot;Váganef&quot;, who in turn had the son Vémundr Wordplane. Vémundr was the father of Valgarður (Valgardur), the father of Hrafn &quot;heimski&quot; (the Foolish). Hrafn was one of the first settlers in Iceland and settled on the southern coast, in Rangárvallasýsla (county of Rángárvellir).

Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; does not mention any Ivar Vidfamne, and gives two different versions of Harald&#x27;s ancestry. First Saxo writes that Harald was the son of the Scanian chieftain Borkar and a woman named Gro. Later Saxo has forgotten about this and writes that Harald was the son of Halfdan, Borkar&#x27;s son, and a woman named Gyrid, the last member of the Skjöldungs.

==Claiming his inheritance==
According to &quot;Sögubrot&quot;, his mother Auðr fled to Garðaríki with her young son when her husband King Hrœrekr was treacherously killed in Zealand by his father-in-law Ivar Vidfamne. She then married the local King Raðbarðr, and Harald stayed at his court. When his grandfather Ivar drowned during a punitive expedition against Raðbarðr, young Harald traveled to Zealand, where he was accepted as king. Then he went to Scania, which his mother&#x27;s family had ruled, and was well received and given much help in men and arms. Then he took his fleet to Sweden in order to claim his inheritance. However, many petty kings arrived to reclaim their kingdoms, which Ivar had taken from them. These petty kings thought it would be easy to fight Harald who was only 15 years old. Harald successfully reclaimed his grandfather&#x27;s domains, so that in the end he owned more than his grandfather had, and there was no king in either Denmark or Sweden who did not pay him tribute or was his vassal. He subjugated all the parts of England that had belonged to Halfdan the Valiant and later Ivar. In England, he appointed kings and jarls and had them pay him tribute. He also appointed Hjörmund, the son of Hjörvard Ylfing, the king of Östergötland. &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; also mentions that Harald retook his grandfather&#x27;s domains, but it says that the conquests started out from Götaland (or Gotland depending on the manuscript). The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; also alleges that Harald&#x27;s nephew Sigurd Hring became (subservient) king over Denmark, which is gainsaid by other sources. &quot;Sögubrot&quot; relates that Hring (Sigurd Hring) received Sweden and Västergötland from his aging uncle, who kept Denmark and Östergötland for himself.

&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; agrees with Sögubrot by saying that the conquests began from Zealand, but adds many details. During an early battle in Zealand he was critically wounded by the champion Veseti and barely saved by his mother Gyrid. Later on he murdered Veseti on the latter&#x27;s wedding night in Scania, and proceeded in slaying King Hader of Jutland and two further petty rulers called Hunding and Rørik, seizing the traditional royal center in Lejre. He was favoured by Odin, so that steel could not hurt him; in return, he offered the souls of those slain by his sword to the god. When the Norwegian petty ruler Åsmund was deposed by his own sister, Harald intervened with a single ship to remedy this infamy. Unarmed and clad in a purple cloak and gold-embroidered coif, he strode towards the enemy at the head of his troops, while the adversaries vainly showered him with javelins. After victory was won, he restored Åsmund, commenting that &quot;the reward of glory was enough by itself&quot;. Meanwhile the Swedish ruler Yngve attacked Denmark in order to expand his realm. Before battle had been joined, Odin appeared before Harald and gave him valuable advice about military tactics, especially the wedge-like Svinfylking formation. Applying this, Harald was able to defeat and kill Yngve and his brother Olof. The third brother Ingjald then sued for peace, that was granted. Later on, however, Ingjald ravished the sister of Harald and the war flared up again. After some indecisive fighting, Harald accepted the Swedish king as a friend and brother-in-law. When Ingjald passed away at a later time, his adolescent son Hring inherited him, while Harald appointed suitable guardians for the boy.

A new incident in Norway draw Harald&#x27;s attention, as King Olaf of the Thrøndir was attacked by the shield-maidens Stikla and Rusla. Again reacting to undue female agency, Harald intervened and slew the two women in person. He next overcame a Frisian raider called Ubbe who had attacked Jutland. When Ubbe was captured after great feats of strength, he agreed to become Harald&#x27;s housecarl and married one of the sisters of the king. Harald furthermore undertook successful expeditions of conquest along the Rhine, in the lands of the Slavs, Aquitania, and Humbria in England. His fame attracted warriors from various parts of the world, who formed a mercenary guard. The mighty Danish ruler spent 50 years in peace, meanwhile subjecting his personal troops to hard military drill.

==The Battle of Bråvalla==
When Harald realized that he was about to die of old age, he suggested to Hring, king of Sweden, that a great battle should be fought between them. The place was chosen to be at the moor of Bråvalla, and so the legendary Battle of Bråvalla came to be. Harald hoped to die in this battle and go to Valhalla instead of dying in his bed and end up in Niflheim. The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; gives a partly different background to the war. Harald and his nephew Hring of Sweden both trusted a councilor called Brune. When Brune drowned on a journey, Odin, who had by now abandoned Harald&#x27;s cause, took his likeness and began to weave a web of intrigues, successfully pitting the two kings against each other. The opposing sides therefore spent seven years in military preparations. By this time, Harald&#x27;s old age and cruelty had made him a burden to his subjects. Hring gathered warriors from Sweden, Västergötland and Norway, while Harald assembled troops from Denmark, the Baltic region and Germany.

The two armies finally moved by sea and land towards the fixed place of the contest at Bråvalla. &quot;Sögubrot&quot; says that this was a moor beneath the forest of Kolmården, close to the Bråviken bay in Östergötland. Hring came first to the battle site and bade his army to rest until the Danes arrived. This took time for the ships were so thick upon the Kattegat that one could walk across the Sound on the ships from Zealand to Skåne as if there was a bridge. When the armies finally opposed each other, Harald found to his consternation that the Swedish army applied the Svinfylking formation that had so often secured victory to the Danes. The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; makes clear that this formed part of Odin&#x27;s sinister game. The kings encouraged their warriors to attack without holding back. The lur horns sounded and the battle cries rose up. The battle began with an exchange of spears and arrows and even then, at the first, of the battle blood flowed upon the ground. Then swords were drawn and warrior fought against warrior. The most ferocious champion on Harald&#x27;s side was Ubbe the Frisian who killed scores of enemies before being shot down by Norwegian archers. Stærkod, on Hring&#x27;s side, fought first with Ubbe the Frisian and received of him six wounds before the combatants drifted apart in the chaos. Then he fought with the shield maiden, Veborg, who struck him in the face so that his beard dangled loose, but he bit his beard to hold on to it. Then he met the shield maiden, Visne. &quot;You hurry to your death!&quot; she shouted. &quot;Now, you shall die!&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he cried, &quot;not before you have lost King Harald&#x27;s standard.&quot; At that instant he struck her hand and went on.

Blind, old King Harald rode out into the fray in a chariot with a sword in each hand and struck away at the enemy. Eventually Harald fell in the battle, according to the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Odin&#x27;s own hand. The god steered the royal chariot in the shape of Brune and bludgeoned the king with a club (since he was hard against steel). Along with him fell 15 kings and 30,000 free-born men. When Hring heard that his opponent had fallen, he instantly gave the sign that the fighting should cease. The day after the battle he sought out King Harald&#x27;s body and put it onto a funeral pyre along with his horse. Hring stood before the fire and bade Harald ride straight to Valhalla and secure lodging for those who had perished. Thereafter, all the chiefs walked around the pyre throwing weapons and gold onto it. Sigurd Hring, traditionally the father of Ragnar Lodbrok, became the ruler of both Denmark and Sweden but not, it seems, of Norway which was then a patchwork of petty kingdoms.

==Historical origins==
The historicity of Harald Wartooth and the Battle of Bråvalla has been much debated over the time. Once seen as an essentially historical event taking place in about 740 or 750, the battle has undergone a number of reinterpretations. Paul Herrmann (1922) saw Harald as an &quot;Odin hero&quot; in an (originally) epically cohesive tale, without denying the possibility of a historical kernel. The saga scholar Axel Olrik (1914) regarded Harald as a historical Danish king who attacked an East Geatic King Hring. Though victorious, the East Geats were weakened and subsequently dominated by the Swedes. The archaeologist Birger Nerman (1925), on the other hand, argued that Harald was indeed the overlord over a comprehensive Danish-Swedish realm, while Hring was a sub-king with authority over Sweden, Västergötland and Gotland. By defeating Harald in the mid 8th century, the Swedes were supposedly able to subordinate Östergötland. Later, Stig Wikander (1960) hypothesized that the battle was an eschatological myth with parallels to Indian mythology, an idea that has been endorsed by some modern scholars. The &quot;Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde&quot; (1999) suggests that the battle has &quot;perhaps certainly&quot; a legendary and fictitious basis, and that the location to Östergötland is likely a later literary addition.

Most modern Scandinavian historians decline to discuss the background of Harald and the battle due to the late sources. Frankish sources name three Danish kings of the 8th century, namely Angantyr (early 8th century), Sigfred (fl. 777-798) and Harald (years unknown, but older kinsman of a set of brothers who flourished after 812). An annal entry of 813 shows that the rivals of this Harald&#x27;s nephews sought support in the struggle for Danish kingship among the Swedes, successfully ousting Harald&#x27;s kin. Whether vague memories of this dynastic contest are reflected in Harald Wartooth&#x27;s story is a moot point.

<text>Charles R. Huband (February 23, 1932–June 14, 2023) was a Manitoba politician, who subsequently became a judge. He was the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party between 1975 and 1978.

Huband attended the University of Manitoba in the 1950s, earning his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba in 1955.

Huband was a member of the Metropolitan Council of Winnipeg from 1964 until 1968 (in which year he served as its Vice Chair). He supported the amalgamation of the city with its suburban neighbourhoods, which was accomplished in the early 1970s by New Democratic Party Premier Edward Schreyer.

Huband first attempted to run for the provincial legislature in 1966, but lost the Liberal nomination in Wolseley to Julius Koteles. He later alleged that Koteles signed up several &quot;instant members&quot; to win the nomination.

Huband ran in the upscale riding of River Heights in the 1973 provincial election, and lost to Progressive Conservative leader Sidney Spivak.

Huband was elected leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party on February 22, 1975, defeating his lone opponent Lloyd Henderson by 381 votes to 87. The party had only four seats in the 57-member legislature at the time, and was in need of renewal. Huband represented a more centrist direction in the party, which had long been considered very right-wing for its time. Under the rural populism of Robert Bend and the libertarianism of Israel Asper, the party&#x27;s electoral fortunes had progressively declined. In a province that had become increasingly polarized between the Tories and NDP, the Liberals were finding it increasingly difficult to present themselves as an alternative.

Huband declared himself a candidate when the central Winnipeg seat of Crescentwood became vacant in early 1975, after the one-vote victory of NDP MLA Harvey Patterson in the 1973 election was overturned. Huband was narrowly defeated by Tory incumbent Warren Steen. He again lost to Steen in the general election of 1977, as the Manitoba Liberals fell to only one seat (that of Lloyd Axworthy).

Huband resigned as party leader in 1978, and later became a Manitoba Court of Appeal judge. In the mid-1990s, he ruled that the Canadian Wheat Board could not be sued by producers. This decision was given in response to a challenge initiated by the right-wing group Farmers For Justice.

In 1996, Huband&#x27;s years of service to the legal profession were recognized by the Manitoba Bar Association, which presented him with its Distinguished Service Award.

In 2007, Huband retired from the Manitoba Court of Appeal and resumed private practice, joining the firm of Taylor McCaffrey LLP.

Huband was an active member of the United Church of Canada and in June 2014 he was elected to the governing council of the Manitoba Historical Society.

Huband tried to return to politics when he won the Liberal nomination in the riding of Portage la Prairie during the 2019 provincial election, and finished a distant third.

<text>Number 3 Squadron, also known as No. 3 (Fighter) Squadron, of the Royal Air Force operates the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, since reforming on 1 April 2006. It was first formed on 13 May 1912 as one of the first squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps – being the first to fly heavier than air aircraft.

==History==

===Foundation and First World War (1912–1919)===
No. 3 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed at Larkhill on by the renaming of No. 2 (Aeroplane) Company of the Air Battalion Royal Engineers, under the command of Major Robert Brooke-Popham. Being already equipped with aeroplanes and manned by pilots and air mechanics, No. 2 (Aeroplane) Company was thus the first British, Empire or Commonwealth independent military unit to operate heavier-than-air flying machines, hence the squadron motto . On 5 July 1912, two members of the squadron, Captain Eustace Loraine and Staff Sergeant Wilson were killed in an aircraft crash, making them the first RFC fatalities. In 1913, the squadron deployed to Halton in Buckinghamshire to support the land manoeuvres of the Household Division. A temporary airfield was set up on what later became RAF Halton&#x27;s Maitland Parade Square. During the exercise, the squadron flew a number of reconnaissance sorties and staged the first confrontation between an airship and an aeroplane.

As well as training and reconnaissance duties, the No. 3 Squadron spent much of its time carrying out experimental work and working out tactics, including how to direct artillery fire from the air. In late 1913, the squadron carried out trials in the use of machine guns from aircraft, which eventually resulted in the selection of the Lewis gun for use by the RFC and from early in 1914 carried out trials in airborne photography, helping to develop the cameras that would be used by the RFC in the First World War. Other trials included the first night flights carried by the RFC.

The squadron was sent to France on the outbreak of the First World War, arriving at Amiens on 13 August 1914, carrying out its first reconnaissance mission, piloted by Captain Philip Joubert de la Ferté on 19 August. The squadron initially operated primarily in the reconnaissance role using a variety of aircraft types. In December 1914, the squadron started to receive Morane-Saulnier L parasol-wing aircraft, and was almost solely equipped with the Morane Parasol by April 1915. It started to replace its Morane-Saulnier L with the improved Morane-Saulnier LA, which had ailerons instead of the wing warping of the earlier aircraft, in September 1915, and all its Parasols were Type LAs by December 1915. In 1916 it supplemented its Parasols with a flight of four Morane-Saulnier BB biplanes, and from the middle of 1916 replaced its Morane-Saulnier LAs with Morane-Saulnier P parasols.

The English ace James McCudden served as a mechanic and occasional observer with 3 Squadron in the early part of the war, leaving the squadron in January 1916 for flying training. Cecil Lewis, author of &quot;Sagittarius Rising&quot; joined the squadron in May 1915 and flew Morane Parasols with the squadron during the Somme offensive. Later in October 1917, with the introduction of Sopwith Camels, a fighter/scout role was taken on, with 59 enemy aircraft being claimed by the end of the war. The squadron disbanded on 27 October 1919.

There were nine flying aces among its ranks, including Douglas John Bell, George R. Riley, Will Hubbard, Adrian Franklyn, Hazel LeRoy Wallace, Lloyd Hamilton, David Hughes, Neil Smuts and William H Maxted.

===Interwar period (1920–1938)===
No. 3 Squadron reformed in India on 1 April 1920 as a fighter squadron equipped with Sopwith Snipes, being disbanded again 30 September 1921. It was immediately reformed the next day at RAF Leuchars, Scotland, as a naval observation squadron equipped with the Airco DH.9A, receiving the Westland Walrus and Avro Bison. The squadron moved to RAF Gosport on 8 November 1922, before being disbanded to form three independent flights on 1 April 1923.

It reformed as a fighter squadron with Snipes a year later on 1 April 1924, operating a succession of different types, based in the UK, including the Gloster Gladiator. The only highlight of these years was the 1935 deployment to the Sudan during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia.

===Second World War (1939–1945)===

At the start of the Second World War No. 3 Squadron was posted as part of Fighter Command to RAF Biggin Hill equipped with the Hawker Hurricane. It briefly deployed to France in support of the British Expeditionary Force following the German attack on the West in 1940, being forced to withdraw after ten days, having claimed 60 German aircraft for the loss of 21 of its own. On 21 July 1940, &quot;B&quot; flight was detached to form the nucleus of the newly formed No. 232 Squadron. Once back up to strength, No. 3 Squadron was used as air defence for the Royal Naval base at Scapa Flow, remaining in Scotland until April 1941, based at the RAF Wick in the north of Scotland. In June 1941, the squadron moved from RAF Martlesham Heath to RAF Stapleford Tawney operating the four-cannon Hurricane II in &#x27;Rhubarb&#x27; attacks on defended ground targets and shipping in northern France and Belgium.

The squadron then co-operated with &quot;Turbinlite&quot; searchlight equipped Douglas Havocs in the night fighter role.

In February 1943, it re-equipped with the Hawker Typhoon for fighter-bomber and anti-shipping strikes. It re-equipped in March 1944 with the new Hawker Tempest fighter, operating over the Normandy beach-head and against German V1 flying bombs, claiming 288 V-1s shot down.

It then deployed across the Channel, flying as part of the Second Tactical Air Force fighting through the low countries and into Germany. Amongst its pilots was Flight Lieutenant Pierre Clostermann, who flew with the squadron from March 1945 until the end of the war in Europe.
===Post-war and Cold War (1946–1968)===
No. 3 Squadron converted to jet aircraft with the de Havilland Vampire F.1 during 1948, in Germany, where it had remained after moving there in the latter stages of the war. The Canadair Sabre F.4 and Hawker Hunter F.4 replaced the Vampire during the 1950s. This was followed by the Gloster Javelin FAW.4 and then a conversion to the English Electric Canberra B(I).8 bomber. Most of its time operating Canberras was spent at RAF Geilenkirchen, moving to RAF Laarbruch in January 1968.

=== Harrier (1972–2005) ===

No. 3 Squadron&#x27;s association with the Hawker Siddeley Harrier began in the early 1970s with the Harrier GR.1 at RAF Wildenrath where it reformed from Canberras to Harriers and they joined No. 4 Squadron and No. 20 Squadron equipped with the Harrier GR.1 and were already operational at Wildenrath. The squadron received the later GR.3 and GR.5 model Harriers successively at RAF Gütersloh, finally receiving the GR.7 and relocating to RAF Laarbruch in 1992. In 1999, with the drawdown of the RAF in Germany, the squadron moved back to the UK along with its sister squadron No. 4 Squadron. The two squadrons operated at RAF Cottesmore, being joined by the other Harrier operator, No. 1 Squadron, in summer 2000.

As part of Joint Force Harrier, No. 3 Squadron operated alongside the British Aerospace Sea Harrier FA2 operated by the Fleet Air Arm and was capable of deployment from the Royal Navy aircraft carriers. Operations included Operation Allied Force in Kosovo in 1999, Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone in 2000 and Operation Telic in Iraq in 2003. In August 2004, it was announced that six Harriers would be deployed to Afghanistan in support of NATO forces.

===Eurofighter Typhoon (2006–present)===
After the Harrier GR7 had been passed to the Fleet Air Arm to be used by the recommissioned No. 800 Naval Air Squadron, No. 3 Squadron moved to RAF Coningsby on 1 April 2006 where it re-equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon and became the first operational front line RAF Typhoon squadron in July 2007. The squadron began to take over Quick Reaction Alert responsibilities from the Panavia Tornado F3 on 29 June 2007.

In March 2011, the squadron deployed to Southern Italy to take part in Operation Ellamy in Libya in support of UN Security Council Resolution 1973.

In May 2012, four Typhoons were deployed to RAF Northolt in an air defence role covering the duration of the London 2012 Summer Olympics, the first time RAF fighters had been stationed at the station since the Second World War.

Between April and August 2017, four of the squadron&#x27;s Typhoons were deployed to Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base, Romania as part of Operation Biloxi. During this deployment, the squadron fighters flew on over 280 training sorties and one sortie in response to Russian Air Force activity over the Black Sea.

During March 2018, six Typhoons from No. 3 Squadron deployed to Andravida Air Base in Greece for &quot;Exercise Iniochos 18&quot;. It was the first time that RAF Typhoons had participated in the annual NATO exercise.

On 3 September 2019, No. 3 Squadron deployed to Oman for two weeks to participate in Exercise Magic Carpet.

== Heritage ==

Approved by King George VI in September 1937, the squadron&#x27;s badge features a cockatrice on a monolith against a yellow and green background. The monolith relates to the ancient monument Stonehenge, which is near Larkhill where the squadron was first established in 1912. The mythological cockatrice is described as being the first creature to fly, reflecting the squadron&#x27;s status as the first British, Empire or Commonwealth unit to operate ‘heavier-than-air’ aircraft. This is also reflected in the squadron’s motto .

<text>Ambulocetus (Latin &quot;ambulare&quot; &quot;to walk&quot; + &quot;cetus&quot; &quot;whale&quot;) is a genus of early amphibious cetacean from the Kuldana Formation in Pakistan, roughly 48 or 47 million years ago during the Early Eocene (Lutetian). It contains one species, Ambulocetus natans (Latin &quot;natans&quot; &quot;swimming&quot;), known solely from a near-complete skeleton. &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; is among the best-studied of Eocene cetaceans, and serves as an instrumental find in the study of cetacean evolution and their transition from land to sea, as it was the first cetacean discovered to preserve a suite of adaptations consistent with an amphibious lifestyle. &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; is classified in the group Archaeoceti—the ancient forerunners of modern cetaceans whose members span the transition from land to sea—and in the family Ambulocetidae, which includes &quot;Himalayacetus&quot; and &quot;Gandakasia&quot; (also from the Eocene of the Indian subcontinent).

&quot;Ambulocetus&quot; had a narrow, streamlined body, and a long, broad snout, with eyes positioned at the very top of its head. Because of these features, it is hypothesised to have behaved much like a crocodile, waiting near the water&#x27;s surface to ambush large mammals, using its powerful jaws to clamp onto and drown or thrash prey. Additionally, its ears possessed similar traits to modern cetaceans, which are specialised for hearing and detecting certain frequencies underwater, although it is unclear if &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; also used these specialised ears for hearing underwater. They may have instead been utilised for bone conduction on land, or perhaps served no function for early cetaceans. 

It is thought to have swum much like a modern river otter, tucking in its forelimbs while alternating its hind limbs for propulsion, as well as undulating the torso and tail. It may have had webbed feet, and unlike its modern relatives, lacked a tail fluke. On land, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; may have walked much like a sea lion.

&quot;Ambulocetus&quot; inhabited the Indian subcontinent during the Eocene. The area had a hot climate with tropical rainforests and coastal mangroves, and &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; may have predominantly inhabited brackish areas such as river mouths. It lived alongside requiem sharks, catfish and various other fishes, turtles, crocodiles, the amphibious hoofed mammal &quot;Anthracobune&quot;, and the fellow cetaceans &quot;Gandakasia&quot;, &quot;Attockicetus&quot;, &quot;Nalacetus&quot;, and &quot;Pakicetus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
===Discovery===

In December 1991, Pakistani palaeontologist Mohammad Arif and Dutch–American palaeontologist Hans Thewissen were jointly funded by Howard University and the Geological Survey of Pakistan to recover land mammal fossils in the Kala Chitta Hills of Punjab, Pakistan. On 3 January 1992, they recovered a small, thick rib fragment. Later in the field season, while surveying the upper Kuldana Formation, Thewissen discovered a femur (thigh bone) and proximal portion of the tibia (upper portion of the shin) which clearly belonged to a mammal. An hour later, Arif discovered the rest of the skeleton, and the two began excavation the next day. At first, Thewissen speculated the fossils belonged to an anthracobunid (a large semi-aquatic mammal), until he found the teeth near the end of the field season, which were characteristically cetacean (living cetaceans are whales, dolphins, and porpoises). Thewissen, at the time, could not afford to excavate and store everything, so he took the skull with him to the United States, while Arif kept the rest in two crates which used to hold oranges. In October 1992, Thewissen presented his research of the skull to a vertebrate palaeontology convention in Toronto, Canada. The next year, American palaeontologist Philip D. Gingerich paid for the rest of the skeleton to be shipped to the United States. In 1994, the formal description of the remains was published by Thewissen, mammal palaeontologist Sayed Taseer Hussain, and Arif. They identified the remains as clearly belonging to an amphibious cetacean, and so they named it &quot;Ambulocetus natans&quot;. The genus name comes from Latin &quot;ambulare&quot; &quot;to walk&quot; and &quot;cetus&quot; &quot;whale&quot;, and the species name &quot;natans&quot; &quot;swimming&quot;.
The Kuldana Formation is constrained to sometime during the Lutetian stage of the Early Eocene, and the remains may date to 48–47 million years ago. The holotype specimen, HGSP 18507, is a partial skeleton initially discovered preserving an incomplete skull (missing the snout), some elements of the vertebral column and ribs, as well as portions of the fore- and hind-limb. Other specimens initially found were HGSP 18473 (a second premolar), HGSP 18497 (a third premolar), HGSP 18472 (a tail vertebra), and HGSP 18476 (lower portion of a femur). The holotype was found in a silt and mudstone bed over a area. Further excavation recovered most of the holotype&#x27;s skeleton—most notably the hip, sacrum, and most of ribcage and thoracolumbar series (the spine excluding the neck, sacrum, and tail). These left the holotype about 80% complete by 2002, making it the most completely known cetacean from the time period. In 2009, some more elements of the holotype&#x27;s jawbone were identified from a then-recently prepared matrix block.

Though it was known that cetaceans descended from land mammals before the discovery of &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, the only evidence of this in the fossil record was the 52-million-year-old (fully terrestrial) &quot;Pakicetus&quot; and the Paleocene mesonychians (as there was a hypothesised link between cetaceans and mesonychians). The limbs of more aquatic Eocene cetaceans did not preserve very well. &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; demonstrated that cetaceans swam by flexing the spine up and down (undulation) before they had evolved the tail fluke, forelimb propulsion evolved relatively late, and that cetaceans went through an otter-like phase with spinal undulation and hindlimb propulsion. These had already been hypothesised to have occurred in the earliest aquatic cetaceans, but were impossible to test without more complete remains. The describers noted that, &quot;&quot;Ambulocetus&quot; represents a critical intermediate between land mammals and marine cetaceans.&quot;

===Classification===

Modern cetaceans (Neoceti) are grouped into either the parvorders Mysticeti (baleen whales) or Odontoceti (toothed whales). Neoceti are descended from the ancient Archaeoceti, whose members span the transition from terrestrial to fully aquatic. Archaeoceti are thus paraphyletic (it is a non-natural group which does not comprise both a common ancestor and all of its descendants). &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was an archaeocete. By the time &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was discovered, archaeocetes were classified into the families Protocetidae (which included what are now the terrestrial Pakicetidae, and the rest were amphibious), Remingtonocetidae (amphibious), Basilosauridae (aquatic), and Dorudontidae (aquatic, now a subfamily of Basilosauridae). The earliest cetaceans were thought to be the mesonychians, proposed before any firm early cetacean fossils were identified. In the original description, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was preliminarily placed into Protocetidae, until the further description of the holotype prompted Thewissen and colleagues to move it into its own family Ambulocetidae in 1996. At the same time, they also erected the family Pakicetidae. They also proposed that some members of Pakicetidae, Protocetidae, and Ambulocetidae were the other two archaeocete families&#x27; ancestors. They suggested that mesonychians gave rise to pakicetids, which gave rise to ambulocetids, which gave rise to both protocetids and remingtonocetids.

Though middle-to-late-Eocene archaeocetes are also known from North America, Europe, and Africa, most of these are found only on the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, it is thought cetaceans originally evolved in that region. Based on molecular data, cetaceans are most closely allied with hippos (Whippomorpha), and they split approximately 54.9 million years ago. They are all placed in the order Cetartiodactyla alongside terrestrial even-toed ungulates (hoofed mammals). This puts mesonychians as a distant relative of cetaceans rather than an ancestor, and their somewhat similar morphology was possibly a result of convergent evolution. The oldest known cetacean is the ambulocetid &quot;Himalayacetus&quot; identified in 1998 and dated to 52.5 million years ago (predating the terrestrial pakicetids), though the exact dating of &quot;Himalayacetus&quot; and &quot;Pakicetus&quot; is debated. Ambulocetidae also includes &quot;Gandakasia&quot;. &quot;Himalayacetus&quot; and &quot;Gandakasia&quot; are known only from partial jaw fragments. Ambulocetidae are endemic to the Indian subcontinent, and span the early to middle Eocene.

== Description ==
===Size===

Upon description, Thewissen and colleagues suggested the holotype specimen may have weighed the same as a male South American sea lion — about — based on the size of the vertebrae, ribs, and limbs. They also estimated a length of roughly . For comparison, the holotype of &quot;Pakicetus attocki&quot; may have been long. In 1996, they estimated weight of &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, using the cross-sections of the long bones, as . Alternatively, they estimated about by using the length of the second upper and lower molars compared to trends between this length and ungulate body mass. They obtained the same result comparing the skull size to those of similarly sized carnivores. In 1998, based on vertebral size, Gingerich estimated a body mass of , similar to modern cetaceans. In 2013, Thewissen suggested that this may be an unreliable mass determinant as the vertebrae are unusually robust in &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;.

===Skull===

Like other archaeocetes which preserve this element, the base of the skull has an undulating contour, probably related to the shape of the nasal canal (and its passage to the throat) and the narrow infraorbital region (the area below the eyes). The base of the skull is wide compared to other archaeocetes, more like that of modern cetaceans. The narrow infraorbital space, made of primarily the pterygoid processes, also occurs in &quot;Remingtonocetus&quot; and &quot;Pakicetus&quot;. The pterygoids connect as far back as the middle ear, much farther than other archaeocetes including the more ancient &quot;Pakicetus&quot;. Most modern cetaceans have a falcate (sickle-shaped) process which juts out prominently halfway between the hypoglossal canal and the ear; &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; has a similar process continuous of the pterygoid, but it runs alongside and behind the hypoglossal canal. Like many other archaeocetes, the pterygoids, sphenoids, and palatines form a wall lining the bottom of the nasal canal, which causes the palate to extend all the way to the ear. Like other cetaceans, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; lacks the postglenoid foramen, which usually is one of the main passageways for veins into the skull in placental mammals. The ectotympanic bone which supports the eardrum is similar to that of &quot;Pakicetus&quot;, about as long as wide, whereas later archaeocetes have more elongate ectotympanics. The ectotympanics of all archaeocetes, nonetheless, are much different than those of terrestrial mammals. The ectotympanics of all cetaceans, including &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, possess an involucrum (thickened lump of bone) at the medial lip. Unlike &quot;Pakicetus&quot;, but like later archaeocetes, the tympanic made close contact with the jaw. Like later archaeocetes, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; seems to have possessed an air sinus in the pterygoids. It may have also had paranasal sinuses. The parietal bones on the braincase sides are more perpendicular than in &quot;Remingtonocetus&quot;, which makes the cheeks appear less flared. Like &quot;Remingtonocetus&quot;, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; appears to have had a small brain.

The snout was quite broad, but the end of the holotype&#x27;s snout is missing, so it is unclear how long it would have been. The snouts of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; and &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; are short and make up about half the skull&#x27;s length. Remingtonocetid snouts are quite narrow, which was clearly not the case for &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;. The mandibular symphysis of most mammals is restricted to the midline of the jaw, but extends much farther in archaeocetes; in &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, it reaches the back end of the first premolar. Snout robustness and symphysis length suggest reinforcement of the jaw to withstand a strong bite force. Similarly, the strongest biting muscle in &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; seems to have been the temporalis muscle involved in biting down. Like other cetaceans, there are embrasure pits (a depression between the teeth), preserving the tooth positions for the fourth premolar, the first molar, and the third molar. Unlike later archaeocetes, the molars&#x27; roots do not extend to the cheek bones, and the third molar is not as nosewards as in remingtonocetids. The coronoid process of the mandible (where the lower jaw connects with the skull) in &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; is steep. In contrast, it is low and slopes gently down in basilosaurids and later cetaceans. The mandibular foramen opens below the coronoid process, and is around midway between terrestrial mammals and toothed whales in size. Like other cetaceans, the body of the hyoid bone (the basihyoid bone) is about as long as wide. Unlike other archaeocetes, the eyes are quite large and are placed near the top of the head facing upwards.
Unlike modern toothed whales which only have one kind of tooth (homodont), archaeocetes are heterodont. Judging by tooth root size, the lower canine was larger than the incisors. The teeth are more robust than those of &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; and &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;. The premolars were double rooted, whereas most archaeocetes have single-rooted first premolars. The enamel of the lower premolars is crenulated (has scalloped edges). The fourth premolar is a high triangular shape. Like other ancient cetaceans, and most pronouncedly in ambulocetids, the lower molars are shorter than the back premolars. The lower premolars are larger than those of &quot;Pakicetus&quot; and are separated by wider gaps (diastemata). The molars had distinct trigonid and talonid cusps (these cusps are lost in basilosaurids), and the upper molars were trituberculate like ancient archaeocetes and ancient placental mammals, meaning they had a large protocone, distinct paracone and metacone, and no accessory cusps. Later archaeocetes developed accessory cusps.

===Ribs and vertebrae===

The holotype preserved seven neck vertebrae, which are rather long at . The 16 preserved thoracic vertebrae have thick spinous and transverse processes (which jut upwards and obliquely from the centrum, the vertebral body), with deep depressions on both sides at the tail-end of each centrum which may have supported strong longissimus muscles which flex the spine. The thoracic vertebrae become longer and wider tailwards and are tallest mid-series. In front-view (anterior aspect), the centra go from heart-shaped to kidney-shaped by T8 (the eighth thoracic vertebra). The pedicals (between the centrum and a transverse process) feature deep grooves. The spinous processes project tailwards from T1–T9, straight up at T10, headwards from T11 to T12, and the rest project straight up. The spinous processes progressively increase in length and width from T11–T16. T10 seems to have been at the level of the thoracic diaphragm. T1–T12 and T14 have capitular facets on the top margin of both the frontward and tailward side to join with the ribs. T15 and T16 have capitular facets on the headward side and lack transverse processes. T11–T15 have accessory anapophyses which jut straight up from the top border between the centrum and the transverse processes; and in T16, these are small, originate near the pedicles, and project tailwards. The width between articular processes (two masses of bone which jut out of each centrum to connect with the next centrum) continually increases through the thoracolumbar series. In life, it is possible it had up to 17 thoracic vertebrae.

The holotype preserves 26 ribs, though it is thought to have had 32 total in life. The cortical bone (the outermost layer) is thickest at the neck of the rib (between the joint and the costal cartilage), at max , and was filled with spongy bone. That is, unlike many other aquatic mammals, the ribs did not exhibit osteosclerosis. They did exhibit pachyostosis, and were made thicker and heavier with additional layers of lamellar bone. The ribs&#x27; shape indicates &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; had a narrow and heart-shaped thorax looking at it head-on. Ribs are thickest at the T8–T10 level. Ribs are broadest at the sternum, which suggests strong sternocostal joints. The ribs have a slight S-curve in side view, with the rib heads angled headwards, and the sternocostal joints angled tailwards. The holotype preserves a central and a tailward sternum bone which are both exceedingly thick, about on the outer margins and decreasing towards the centre. The central sternum bone is longer and wider than the tailward one.

The eight preserved lumbar vertebrae at the lower back are much longer than the thoracic, and the centra and transverse processes, from L1–L7, continually increase in length and height. The short transverse processes on L8 are probably due to its proximity to the ilium on the hip. The undersides are concave. The spinous processes are long and tall, and project headward from L1–L5, and straight-up from L6–L8. The spinous processes are bulbous on the tailward side to support epaxial muscles. The vertebral laminae are excavated headward to support the interspinous ligaments which connect the spinous processes. The vertebrae are about as robust as those of modern pinniped such as sow leopard seals and bull walruses. The postzygapophyses (the surface where the vertebrae join with each other) is flat rather than revolute, which would have made the series more flexible than that of terrestrial relatives.

For the four preserved sacral vertebrae (at the sacrum, between the pelvic bones), the transverse processes of S1 are smaller than those of L8. There is a robust sacroiliac joint with the hip. For the spinous processes, those of S1–S3 are fused. Metapophyses jut straight up from each lamina near the joint, progressively getting smaller with each vertebra.

Only five of the tail (caudal) vertebrae are preserved: a possible C1 or C2, a possible C3, a possible C4, a possible C7, and a possible C8. The more headward tail vertebrae have thick transverse processes, whereas those of the middle tail vertebrae are longer than broad. The C3 has a narrow spinous process and is mostly columnar, but the tailward side is broader. The C4 is more columnar. The C7 and C8 are columnar and taper off tailward, and the neural canal where the central nervous system runs through is still present. In life, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; possibly had upwards of 20 tail vertebrae like some mesonychians. If correct, then &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; would have had a lot fewer and a lot longer tail vertebrae than modern cetaceans.

===Limbs and girdles===

Unlike modern cetaceans, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; had functional legs which could support the animal&#x27;s bodyweight on land. The holotype has a robust radius and ulna (the forearm bones). The forearm measures in length. The head of the radius is somewhat triangular, which probably means the forearm was locked in a semi-pronated position (the palms were orientated towards the ground). The olecranon, which formed part of the elbow joint, makes up about a third of the ulna&#x27;s length and is inclined tailwards, which would have allowed the triceps to more forcefully flex the elbow. The wrist bones indicate a strong flexor carpi ulnaris muscle for wrist flexion. The hand had five widely spaced digits. The first metacarpal (which is in the thumb) is long, the second , the third , the fourth , and the fifth . Like modern beaked whales, the thumb is short and slender.

The ilium of the hip of &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, like remingtonocetids, features deep depressions to support the rectus femoris and the gluteal muscles. Unlike terrestrial mammals and protocetids, the ischium is expanded dorsolaterally (from left to right, and upwards), which would have increased lever arm for thigh and leg retractor muscles when extended, such as while swimming. This would have also increased the surface area of the gemelli muscles (hip rotators which stabilise the hip) and the tail muscles. The widening of the ischium may have also given &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; a more streamlined and hydrodynamic body. &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; had a pubic symphysis connecting the two pubic bones at the base of the pelvis together, which indicates the animal could support its own weight on land. The modern cetacean pubis bone lacks this and only functions to anchor abdominal and urogenital muscles.

The leg proportions of &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; are similar to otters and seals, and American mammalogist Alfred Brazier Howell predicted similar proportions for a transitional cetacean in 1930. The femur measures , a length similar to the presumably cursorial (capable of running) mesonychian &quot;Pachyaena&quot;. Archaeocete femora are generally much shorter. The femoral head is spherical and, at maximum, has a width of , similar to &quot;Indocetus&quot; but much larger than mesonychians and &quot;Rodhocetus&quot;. The trochanteric fossa, supporting the lateral rotator group at the hip, is quite deep, but other than this, the femur does not seem to have supported particularly strong extensor or flexor muscles. The femoral condyles of &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; are quite long compared to those of other archaeocetes and mesonychians, suggesting the knee was capable of hyperflexion (bending). The tibia is overall similar to those of mesonychians. The feet are huge, probably longer than the femur. The toes are also relatively long, with the fourth digit measuring in length. The fifth digit is slightly shorter and much less robust than the fourth. The phalanges of the toes are short, and end with a convex hoof. Like seals, the phalanges of both the hands and feet are flattened, which may have streamlined them to allow for webbed feet.

== Palaeobiology ==
===Diet===

The robustness of the cheek teeth, as well as the cusp arrangement, suggests they were involved in crushing, and the fact that both the premolars and molars were involved in crushing indicates &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; required a large area for crushing, such as when biting into large prey items. Similarly, the broad and powerful snout makes it unlikely it was pursuing small, quick prey items (which would have required a narrow snout like dolphins or gharials). The snout was also long, which may have precluded the ability to crush bone because it would have had reduced structural integrity at the tip. The anatomy of the cheek teeth resembles those of Mesozoic marine reptiles which fed on armoured fish, large fish, reptiles, and ammonites, and the teeth may have been used to grip onto prey firmly. Therefore, Thewissen suggested &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was most likely an ambush predator, the jaw adapted to handle struggling prey. The unusually deep pterygoids potentially functioned to dissipate force while the prey was struggling.

The eyes of &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; were placed on the top of the head, similar to crocodiles and other animals that prefer to keep most of their body submerged with the eyes peeking out of the water. The nasal canal has bony walls extending into the throat, much like in crocodiles where they keep the nasal airways open while the animal is killing prey either by drowning it or thrashing it around. Pieces of prey are subsequently torn off by forceful, thrashing head and body motions, the feet anchoring the crocodile in place. Thewissen believed &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; used a similar feeding tactic, though &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was probably capable of chewing, unlike crocodiles. &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; may have attacked large mammals which approached the water&#x27;s edge, and semi-aquatic mammals including early (possibly herbivorous) sirenians (now manatees and the dugong) and the probably amphibious anthracobunids. These two seem to have been rather common on the coasts of the Indian subcontinent, which could mean they were regular prey items. Since &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was found in marine deposits (where animals would not come to drink), it is possible it hunted in river deltas which were recorded in the Kuldana Formation. &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; probably went after fish and reptiles when given the opportunity, though it may not have had the agility to commonly catch them.

===Locomotion===

Thewissen hypothesised that &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was a drag-powered swimmer, and used its huge feet as its primary propulsion mechanism, much like modern river otters including the giant otter, and species in the genera &quot;Lontra&quot; and &quot;Lutra&quot;. Based on the length of the known tail vertebrae, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; may have had an inflexible tail, which would have made the tail an inefficient primary propulsion mechanism due to poorer lever arm (modern cetaceans have relatively short tail vertebrae). &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; therefore likely did not have a tail fluke. Nonetheless, drag powered swimmers still have powerful tails for producing lift, and the tails of river otters are 125% the size of the thoracolumbar series. So, using river otters as a model, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was a pelvic paddler—swimming with alternating beats of the hindlimbs (without engaging the forelimbs)—and also undulated (moved up and down) its tail while swimming. Like the sea otter, pelvic paddling may have been done at the surface to move at slow or moderate speeds. At higher speeds fully submerged, undulation of the spine would have become more prominent, though the feet still would have acted as the primary propulsion mechanism.

Based on the pelvis and robust forelimbs, Thewissen believed &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; was capable of venturing onto land, and was more efficient at doing this than remingtonocetids and protocetids (it is unclear if the latter two were capable of bearing weight on the limbs). &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; possibly used a sprawling gait on land, similar to modern sea lions. In 2016, Japanese biologists Konami Ando and Shin-ichi Fujiwara performed a statistical test of ribcage strength among terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and fully aquatic mammals, and found that &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; clustered with fully aquatic mammals, because they assigned a very high rib density on par with fully aquatic sirenians which use their heavy, osteosclerotic ribs as ballast. They then concluded &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; could not walk on land, but cautioned the study was limited by a lack of information on the exact density of the bone, the location of the centre of mass, and the reliance of false ribs for thoracic support.

===Hearing===
Modern cetaceans have highly specialised ear bones to hear underwater as well as to detect certain frequency ranges. Unlike most other mammals, cetacean ear bones are comparatively thick, and so preserve more reliably in the fossil record. Modern cetaceans have air sinuses surrounding the ear bones (peritympanic sinuses), which acoustically isolate the ear by reflecting sound moving through the head and interrupting both bony and fleshy connections of the ear to the skull. Like later archaeocetes, &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; had at least one such sinus between the tympanic bone and the skull base. The evolution of these sinuses also seems to have caused some restructuring of the skull base due to the development of bony walls surrounding the sinuses. The ectotympanic of all cetaceans, including &quot;Pakicetus&quot; and &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, has a bony growth (involucrum) on the medial lip speculated to aid in the detection of low-frequency sounds. All cetaceans also have a vertical crest (&quot;sigmoid process&quot;) right in front of the ear canal, which is speculated to be related to the increasing size of the malleus bone in the middle ear.

As for the outer ear, terrestrial mammals channel sound in via an ear canal, but those of modern cetaceans are either narrowed or completely plugged, the sound being picked up (at least for toothed whales) by a fat pad in the lower jaw running to the ectotympanic bone. The mandibular foramen size can determine the size of the fat pad, and that of &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; is larger than that of &quot;Pakicetus&quot; and terrestrial mammals, but is smaller than later archaeocetes and toothed whales. Nonetheless, a lot of the change to the external auditory apparatus occurred between &quot;Pakicetus&quot; and &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;. These early archaeocetes may have developed such an external ear to either: better hear underwater; facilitate bone conduction of vibrations on dry land as some low-lying terrestrial creatures do (namely turtles and subterranean mole rats); or it was non-functional, and the malleus and jawbone (which are connected in the embryo stage of mammals) happened to stop separating.

==Palaeoecology==

During the Eocene, the Indian subcontinent was an island just beginning its collision with Asia which would eventually lead to the uprising of the Himalayas. The Eocene had a greenhouse climate (no permanent ice sheets at the poles) as opposed to the icehouse climate of today, so, in general, areas were much warmer. The abundance of Eocene brown coal deposits preserving tropical biota on the Indian subcontinent indicates the proliferation of tropical rainforests in a hot climate. Mangroves seem to have commonly grown along the subcontinent&#x27;s western margin in the Early Eocene but decreased nearing the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (a warming trend). The waters off the western coast seem to have featured upwelling and low oxygen.

The holotype was identified in the upper level of the Kuldana Formation at Locality 9209, which features green mud and silt as well as a bed of marine shells, including marine snails (such as &quot;Turritella&quot;) and bivalves. It was likely a coastal area. A redbed underlies this layer, followed by grey, green, and purple freshwater mud, silts, sandstones, and limestone. These beds alternate with showing marine deposits. The holotype was found in green mud. Near Locality 9209, the formation begins with of grey and green mud, silt, and sandstone, containing two bivalve beds. The first often stretches only one shell, whereas the second stretches down, and the formation terminates with a bed before transitioning to the younger Kohat Formation. The holotype was found a few decimeters above the second bed.

The area may have formed in a shallow sea off the shores of a coastal swamp or forest. The only other vertebrate remains found at the 9209 locality was a (now lost) reptile scute. Other localities of the upper level of the formation have yielded remains of requiem sharks, the fish &quot;Stephanodus&quot;, catfish, turtles, crocodiles, and the anthracobunid &quot;Anthracobune pinfoldi&quot;. Other archaeocetes from the formation are: the ambulocetid &quot;Gandakasia&quot;, the remingtonocetid &quot;Attockicetus&quot;, and the pakicetids &quot;Nalacetus&quot;, &quot;Pakicetus calcis&quot;, and &quot;P. chittas&quot;. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis indicates &quot;Ambulocetus&quot; inhabited brackish waters (part fresh and part salt water), possibly at a river mouth.

<text>Nodosaurus (meaning &#x27;knobbed lizard&#x27;) is a genus of herbivorous nodosaurid ankylosaurian dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous, the fossils of which are found exclusively in the Frontier Formation in Wyoming.

==Description==
&quot;Nodosaurus&quot; grew up to roughly long and it was an ornithischian dinosaur with bony dermal plates covering the top of its body, and it may have had spikes along its side as well. The dermal plates were arranged in bands along its body, with narrow bands over the ribs alternating with wider plates in between. These wider plates were covered in regularly arranged bony nodules, which give the animal its scientific name. In 2010 Paul estimated its length at 6 meters (20 ft) and its weight at 3.5 tonnes (3.85 short tons).

It had four short legs, five-toed feet, a short neck, and a long, stiff, clubless tail. The head was narrow, with a pointed snout, powerful jaws, and small teeth. It perhaps ate soft plants, as it would have been unable to chew tough, fibrous ones; or alternatively it may have processed the latter with gastroliths and its enormous intestinal apparatus.

==History and classification==
During the Bone Wars between palaeontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, Marsh sent his collector William Harlow Reed to the Cenomanian strata of the Frontier Formation of Albany County, Wyoming to collect fossil mammals and reptiles. Reed collected a partial postcranial skeleton (YPM VP 1815) on July 17, 1881 southeast of the productive Quarry 13, the skeleton including: 3 dorsal and 13 caudal vertebrae, 3 dorsal ribs, fragmentary forelimbs, a partial pelvis, femora, tibiae, partial left pes, and several osteoderms. One of the first armored dinosaurs to be discovered in North America, &quot;Nodosaurus textilis&quot; was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889, the generic name meaning &quot;knobbed lizard&quot; and the specific name meaning &quot;woven&quot;. Marsh assigned the genus to Stegosauria, but later assigned it to its own family, Nodosauridae, in 1890 based on the heavy dermal armor, solid bones, large forelimbs, and ungulate feet. The type specimen remains the only definite specimen of &quot;Nodosaurus&quot;, though &quot;Stegopelta&quot; has been considered a synonym in the past, it is most likely a distinct struthiosaurin. Richard Swan Lull did a more comprehensive description of &quot;Nodosaurus&quot; in 1921, who assigned the taxa &quot;Stegopelta, Hoplitosaurus, Hierosaurus, Ankylosaurus,&quot; and placed the British &quot;Polacanthus&quot; as a relative of the family&quot;.&quot;

Within Nodosauridae, &quot;Nodosaurus&quot; falls out in the subfamily Nodosaurinae, formally defined as the largest clade containing &quot;Nodosaurus textilis&quot; but not &quot;Hylaeosaurus armatus&quot;, &quot;Mymoorapelta maysi&quot; and &quot;Polacanthus foxii&quot;. The 2018 phylogenetic analysis of Nodosauridae by Rivera-Sylva and colleagues is below.

The other two genera in the family, &quot;Gandakasia&quot; and &quot;Himalayacetus&quot;, are known only from teeth and mandibular fragments. Retaining large hindlimbs, it was once thought that they could walk on land—indeed, their name means &quot;walking whales&quot;—, but recent research suggests they may have been fully aquatic like modern cetaceans, though the research has some limits that cast doubt on this conclusion. 

==Description==

The most basal of marine cetaceans, ambulocetids lived in shallow near-shore environments such as estuaries and bays, but were still dependent on fresh water during some stage of their life. Some of the characteristics related to sound transmission found in the lower jaws of modern whales that were absent in pakicetids are present in ambulocetids. They probably swam by paddling their large feet, which is not a very efficient mode of locomotion, suggesting they ambushed rather than chased prey. Ambulocetids had a narrow head with eyes facing laterally. Another lineage of fully aquatic freshwater predators, the neochoristoderes such as &quot;Champsosaurus&quot;, also have forward-faced eyes, as opposed to the dorsally positioned eyes of crocodilians and other amphibious predators.

&quot;Ambulocetus&quot; and &quot;Gandakasia&quot; primarily ate terrestrial prey, while a combination of low-oxygen isotope and high-carbon isotope values suggests that &quot;Himalayacetus&quot; consumed fresh water but ate marine prey, thus that it foraged in a marine environment but drank fresh water.

==Phylogeny==

Ambulocetid fossils have been found in Pakistan along the former coastline of Cimmeria. The sedimentary facies in which these fossils were found indicates that ambulocetids inhabited a shallow, swampy near-shore marine environment. They may have occupied a similar ecological niche to river dolphins.

The family is believed to have diverged from the more terrestrial Pakicetidae. The families Protocetidae and possibly Remingtonocetidae, are believed to have arisen from a common ancestor with ambulocetids. Together with Basilosauridae, the five families are classified under the suborder Archaeoceti.

<text>Kensington Road is a section of road in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the City of Westminster, London, forming part of the A315 road.
==Location and description==
It runs along the south edge of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park in the West End of London. To the west it becomes Kensington High Street, to the east it becomes Knightsbridge, while Kensington Gore is the name applied to the middle section. To the north is Kensington Palace and to the south, the road is joined by Palace Gate, Queen&#x27;s Gate, Exhibition Road, and Rutland Gate (west to east).

==Features and transport==
Kensington Road houses is one of the remaining thirteen Grade II listed Cabmen&#x27;s Shelters used by London&#x27;s taxi drivers as a place to buy food and (non-alcoholic) drink.

The London bus routes 9, 23, 52, 360 and 452 serve Kensington Road.
==Prince&#x27;s Gate==
Running adjacent to Kensington Road on the south side, separated by a high wall, is Prince&#x27;s Gate. It was named after a gate into Hyde Park, opened in 1848 by Edward VII, the then Prince of Wales. In 1855 some stuccoed terraces were built opposite it, facing Kensington Road. They were described by Leigh Hunt as like &quot;a set of tall, thin gentlemen squeezing together to look at something over the way&quot;. Many of the individual properties are now embassies or offices. Notable ones include:

* The Embassy of Iran, 16 Prince&#x27;s Gate
* The Embassy of Ethiopia, 17 Prince&#x27;s Gate
* The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum, 20 Prince&#x27;s Gate
* The Embassy of Thailand (branch), 28 Prince&#x27;s Gate
* The Embassy of Tunisia, 29 Prince&#x27;s Gate
* The Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, 30 Prince&#x27;s Gate
* The Embassy of Afghanistan, 31 Prince&#x27;s Gate (entrance in Exhibition Road)
==Notable residents==
Several notable people lived in Prince&#x27;s Gate too. Field Marshal Douglas Haig lived and died at No. 21 in 1928; Robert Baden-Powell lived at No. 32 in 1903–14; and Joseph Chamberlain lived at No. 72 in 1880–2. No. 14 was the home of Joseph Kennedy when he was the American ambassador to Britain in 1937–40, accompanied by his son John F. Kennedy.

<text>Doug Martyn Lauchlan (February 18, 1931 – February 15, 2016) was a Canadian politician, minister and educator. From 1980 to 1982, he was the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party.

Lauchlan was an ordained minister in the United Church of Canada, and was the President of Mount Royal College in Calgary during the 1970s. He also worked as an advisor to Lloyd Axworthy.

In 1979, Lauchlan was a federal Liberal candidate in the Alberta riding of Calgary West. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative Jim Hawkes.

On November 30, 1980, Lauchlan was elected leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party, defeating Hugh Moran by 493 votes to 300. The Manitoba Liberals were in a precarious position in this period, holding only one seat in the provincial legislature (that of June Westbury, who replaced Axworthy in the by-election).

With the electorate polarized between the Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats, the Liberals were unable to present themselves as a viable alternative. In the general election of 1981, Lauchlan finished a poor third in the riding of Wolseley and the Liberal Party was eliminated from the legislature for the only time in its history. Lauchlan resigned as party leader in 1982.

Lauchlan subsequently returned to Alberta, where he became executive director of the United Way. He then moved on to become the CEO of the Calgary Centre for Performing Arts, currently known as Arts Common, until his retirement ten years later. In 1988, he was recognized by the Canadian Speech Association as Speaker of the Year. He was also a director of the Banff Centre, one of the founding members of the board of the Esther Honens Piano Festival, and the Calgary International Organ Festival.

Lauchlan was married to Margaret for 57 years, until her death in 2011. They had 4 children. Doug Lauchlan died on February 15, 2016, at the age of 84.

<doc id="893640" wikidata="Q7432874" url="?curid=893640" title="Schreier–Sims algorithm">
<text>The Schreier–Sims algorithm is an algorithm in computational group theory, named after the mathematicians Otto Schreier and Charles Sims. This algorithm can find the order of a finite permutation group, determine whether a given permutation is a member of the group, and other tasks in polynomial time. It was introduced by Sims in 1970, based on Schreier&#x27;s subgroup lemma. The running time was subsequently improved by Donald Knuth in 1991. Later, an even faster randomized version of the algorithm was developed.

== Background and timing ==

The algorithm is an efficient method of computing a base and strong generating set (BSGS) of a permutation group. In particular, an SGS determines the order of a group and makes it easy to test membership in the group. Since the SGS is critical for many algorithms in computational group theory, computer algebra systems typically rely on the Schreier–Sims algorithm for efficient calculations in groups.

The running time of Schreier–Sims varies on the implementation. Let formula_1 be given by formula_2 generators. For the deterministic version of the algorithm, possible running times are:

* formula_3 requiring memory formula_4
* formula_5 requiring memory formula_6

The use of Schreier vectors can have a significant influence on the performance of implementations of the Schreier–Sims algorithm.

The Monte Carlo variations of the Schreier–Sims algorithm have the estimated complexity:

: formula_7 requiring memory formula_8.

Modern computer algebra systems, such as GAP and Magma, typically use an optimized Monte Carlo algorithm.

== Outline of basic algorithm ==

Following is C++-style pseudo-code for the basic idea of the Schreier-Sims algorithm. It is meant to leave out all finer details, such as memory management or any kind of low-level optimization, so as not to obfuscate the most important ideas of the algorithm. Its goal is not to compile.
struct Group

Notable details left out here include the growing of the orbit tree and the calculation of each new Schreier generator. In place of the orbit tree, a Schreier vector can be used, but the idea is essentially the same. The tree is rooted at the identity element, which fixes the point stabilized by the subgroup. Each node of the tree can represent a permutation that, when combined with all permutations in the path from the root to it, takes that point to some new point not visited by any other node of the tree. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, these form a transversal of the subgroup of our group that stabilizes the point whose entire orbit is maintained by the tree. Calculating a Schreier generator is a simple application of the Schreier&#x27;s subgroup lemma.

Another detail left out is the membership test. This test is based upon the sifting process. A permutation is sifted down the chain at each step by finding the containing coset, then using that coset&#x27;s representative to find a permutation in the subgroup, and the process is repeated in the subgroup with that found permutation. If the end of the chain is reached (i.e., we reach the trivial subgroup), then the sifted permutation was a member of the group at the top of the chain.

<text>William Gibson (November 13, 1914 – November 25, 2008) was an American playwright and novelist. He won the Tony Award for Best Play for &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; in 1959, which he later adapted for a film version in 1962.

==Early life and education==
Gibson graduated from the City College of New York in 1938. He was of Irish, French, German, Dutch, Russian, and Greek ancestry.

==Work as playwright==
Gibson made his Broadway debut with &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; in 1958, a critically acclaimed two-character play, which starred Henry Fonda and, in her own Broadway debut, Anne Bancroft. It was directed by Arthur Penn. Gibson published a chronicle of the vicissitudes of rewriting for the sake of this production with &quot;The Seesaw Log&quot;, a nonfiction book. His most famous play is &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1959), the story of Helen Keller&#x27;s childhood education, which won him the Tony Award for Best Play after he adapted it from his original 1957 telefilm script. He adapted the work again for the 1962 film version, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Arthur Penn directed both the stage and film versions.

His other works include &quot;Dinny and the Witches&quot; (1948, revised 1961), in which a jazz musician incurs the wrath of three Shakespearean witches by blowing a riff which stops time; the book for the musical version of Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1964), which earned him yet another Tony nomination; &quot;A Mass for the Dead&quot; (1968), an autobiographical family chronicle; &quot;A Cry of Players&quot; (1968), a speculative account of the life of young William Shakespeare (with Anne Bancroft starring for Gibson, this time as Shakespeare&#x27;s wife, Anne Hathaway); &quot;American Primitive&quot; (1969), a verse play adapted from the letters of John and Abigail Adams, premiered at Williamstown Theatre Festival, directed by Frank Langella and starring Anne Bancroft; &quot;Goodly Creatures&quot; (1980), about Puritan dissident Anne Hutchinson; and &quot;Monday After the Miracle&quot; (1982), a continuation of the Helen Keller story. His ill-received &quot;Golda&quot; (1977), a work about Golda Meir became so popular in its revised version, titled &quot;Golda&#x27;s Balcony&quot; (2003), that it set a record as the longest-running one-woman play in Broadway history on January 2, 2005.

1984 marked the debut of &quot;Raggedy Ann: The Musical Adventure&quot;, a dark fantasy about a sickly little girl who&#x27;s whisked away on a quest to evade death, featuring the titular doll from popular children&#x27;s stories, and songs by &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s Joe Raposo. The show traveled to Russia, where it was a smash-hit the following year under the title &quot;Rag Dolly&quot;, and then it closed on Broadway in 1986 with only 15 previews and 5 performances. Thanks to bootleg recordings, the show went on to garner a cult reputation on the internet.

==Other published works==
In 1973, Gibson published &quot;A Season in Heaven&quot;, an account of his studies with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Punta Umbria and La Antilla, Spain. In 1954, Gibson published the novel &quot;The Cobweb&quot;, set in a psychiatric hospital resembling the Menninger Clinic; in 1955, the novel was adapted as a movie by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

==Family and later life==
Gibson married Margaret Brenman-Gibson, a psychotherapist and biographer of Clifford Odets, in 1940. After 1954, the couple moved from Topeka, Kansas, to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where Margaret took a position as a psychoanalyst. She died in 2004.

<doc id="893649" wikidata="Q144132" url="?curid=893649" title="Unto This Last">
<text>Unto This Last is an essay critical of economics by John Ruskin, who published the first chapter between August and December 1860 in the monthly journal &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; in four articles.

== Title ==
The title is a quotation from the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard:
The &quot;last&quot; are the eleventh hour labourers, who are paid as if they had worked the entire day. Rather than discuss the contemporary religious interpretation of the parable, whereby the eleventh hour labourers would be death-bed converts, or the peoples of the world who come late to religion, Ruskin looks at the social and economic implications, discussing issues such as who should receive a living wage. This essay is very critical of the economists of the 18th and 19th centuries. In this sense, Ruskin is a precursor of social economy. Because the essay also attacks the destructive effects of industrialism upon the natural world, some historians have seen it as anticipating the Green movement.

The essay begins with the following verses, taken from Matthew 20:13 and Zechariah 11:12 respectively (in the King James Version):
&lt;poem&gt;
Friend, I do thee no wrong.
Didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
Take that thine is, and go thy way.
I will give unto this last even as unto thee.

If ye think good, give me my price;
And if not, forbear.
So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Reception and influence ==
Ruskin says himself that the articles were &quot;very violently criticized&quot;, forcing the publisher to stop its publication after four months. Subscribers sent protest letters, but Ruskin countered the attack and published the four articles in a book in May 1862. One of the few that received the book positively was Thomas Carlyle, whom Ruskin said had &quot;led the way&quot; for &quot;Unto This Last&quot; with his critique of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; political economy as the &quot;Dismal Science&quot;. Carlyle wrote to Ruskin:I have read your paper with exhilaration, exultation, often with laughter, with bravissimo! Such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads on the same day, will do a great deal of good. . . . my joy is great to find myself henceforth in a minority of two, at any rate. The Dismal-Science people will object that their science expressly abstracts itself from moralities, from etc., etc.; but what you say and show is incontrovertibly true—that no &#x27;science,&#x27; worthy of men (and not worthier of dogs or of devils), has a right to call itself &#x27;political economy,&#x27; or can exist at all, except mainly as a fetid nuisance and a public poison, on other terms than those you shadow out to it for the first time.The book is cited as an inspiration upon the British Labour Party in its initial stages, a survey of Labour Members of Parliament after the party achieved its electoral breakthrough in the 1906 UK general election listing the book as one of their key influences.

=== Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s paraphrase ===
&quot;Unto This Last&quot; had a very important impact on Gandhi&#x27;s philosophy. He discovered the book in March 1904 through Henry Polak, whom he had met in a vegetarian restaurant in South Africa. Polak was sub-editor of the Johannesburg paper &quot;The Critic&quot;. Gandhi decided immediately not only to change his own life according to Ruskin&#x27;s teaching, but also to publish his own newspaper, &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;, from a farm where everybody would get the same salary, without distinction of function, race, or nationality. This, for that time, was quite revolutionary. Thus Gandhi created Phoenix Settlement.

Gandhi translated &quot;Unto This Last&quot; into Gujarati in 1908 under the title of &quot;Sarvodaya&quot; (&quot;Well Being of All&quot;). Valji Govindji Desai translated it back to English in 1951 under the title of &quot;Unto This Last: A Paraphrase&quot;. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics, as in &quot;Unto This Last&quot;, Gandhi found an important part of his social and economic ideas.

<text>Freedom Park is a two block long elevated linear park in the Rosslyn section of Arlington, Virginia. It was built on an elevated concrete structure originally constructed for use as an automobile overpass, and as such, rises above and over the surrounding streets.

The park was founded in 1996 as a joint-venture with the Newseum and Freedom Forum Journalists Memorial, both operated by the Freedom Forum, and was dedicated to the spirit of freedom and the struggle to preserve it. In 2008 the Newseum moved to a new location in the District of Columbia, upon which time a property developer took over operations of the park, and most of the original exhibits were removed.

Today the park is used primarily by residents and workers of Rosslyn as a quiet escape from the busy city below.

== Exhibits ==
=== Current ===
* &quot;Spectrum of Freedom&quot;, 7 tile murals created by Karen Singer and 270 children from Arlington schools 

=== Former exhibits ===
Former exhibits which were removed in 2008 included:
*Stones from the Warsaw Ghetto.
*A headless statue of Vladimir Lenin, one of many that were beheaded when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
*A bronze casting of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s Birmingham jail-cell door.
*A bronze casting of a boat used by Cuban refugees.
*A casting of a South African ballot box from the apartheid era.
*Pieces of the Berlin Wall — the largest display of the wall outside of Germany.
*Journalists Memorial, a spiraling memorial made of dichroic glass that honors reporters, editors, photographers and broadcasters who gave their lives reporting the news 

A reproduction of the Statue of Freedom, which caps the dome of the United States Capitol, and the Goddess of Democracy, originally constructed for the Tiananmen Square protests in China, were also on display.

<doc id="893668" wikidata="Q3820120" url="?curid=893668" title="Bias blind spot">
<text>The bias blind spot is the cognitive bias of recognizing the impact of biases on the judgment of others, while failing to see the impact of biases on one&#x27;s own judgment. The term was created by Emily Pronin, a social psychologist from Princeton University&#x27;s Department of Psychology, with colleagues Daniel Lin and Lee Ross. The bias blind spot is named after the visual blind spot. Most people appear to exhibit the bias blind spot. In a sample of more than 600 residents of the United States, more than 85% believed they were less biased than the average American. Only one participant believed that they were more biased than the average American. People do vary with regard to the extent to which they exhibit the bias blind spot. This phenomenon has been successfully replicated and it appears that in general, stronger personal free will beliefs are associated with bias blind spot. It appears to be a stable individual difference that is measurable.

The bias blind spot appears to be a true blind spot in that it is unrelated to actual decision making ability. Performance on indices of decision making competence are not related to individual differences in bias blind spot. In other words, most people appear to believe that they are less biased than others, regardless of their actual decision making ability.

==Causes==
Bias blind spots may be caused by a variety of other biases and self-deceptions.

Self-enhancement biases may play a role, in that people are motivated to view themselves in a positive light. Biases are generally seen as undesirable, so people tend to think of their own perceptions and judgments as being rational, accurate, and free of bias. The self-enhancement bias also applies when analyzing our own decisions, in that people are likely to think of themselves as better decision-makers than others.

People also tend to believe they are aware of &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; they make their decisions, and therefore conclude that bias did not play a role. Many of our decisions are formed from biases and cognitive shortcuts, which are unconscious processes. By definition, people are unaware of unconscious processes, and therefore cannot see their influence in the decision making process.

When made aware of various biases acting on our perception, decisions, or judgments, research has shown that we are still unable to control them. This contributes to the bias blind spot in that even if one is told that they are biased, they are unable to alter their biased perception.

==Role of introspection==
Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler have argued that this phenomenon is due to the introspection illusion. In their experiments, subjects had to make judgments about themselves and about other subjects. They displayed standard biases, for example rating themselves above the others on desirable qualities (demonstrating illusory superiority). The experimenters explained cognitive bias, and asked the subjects how it might have affected their judgment. The subjects rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than others in the experiment (confirming the bias blind spot). When they had to explain their judgments, they used different strategies for assessing their own and others&#x27; bias.

Pronin and Kugler&#x27;s interpretation is that, when people decide whether someone else is biased, they use overt behaviour. On the other hand, when assessing whether they themselves are biased, people look inward, searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives. Since biases operate unconsciously, these introspections are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, are immune to bias.

Pronin and Kugler tried to give their subjects access to others&#x27; introspections. To do this, they made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they decided whether their answer to a previous question might have been affected by bias. Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers.

==Differences of perceptions==
People tend to attribute bias in an uneven way. When people reach different perceptions, they tend to label one another as biased while labelling themselves as accurate and unbiased. Pronin hypothesizes that this bias misattribution may be a source of conflict and misunderstanding between people. For example, in labeling another person as biased, one may also label their intentions cynically. But when examining one&#x27;s own cognitions, people judge themselves based on their good intentions. It is likely that in this case, one may attribute another&#x27;s bias to &quot;intentional malice&quot; rather than an unconscious process.

Pronin also hypothesizes ways to use awareness of the bias blind spot to reduce conflict, and to think in a more &quot;scientifically informed&quot; way. Although we are unable to control bias on our own cognitions, one may keep in mind that biases are acting on everyone. Pronin suggests that people might use this knowledge to separate other&#x27;s intentions from their actions.

== Relation to actual commission of bias ==
Initial evidence suggests that the bias blind spot is not related to actual decision-making ability. Participants who scored better or poorer on various tasks associated with decision making competence were no more or less likely to be higher or lower in their susceptibility to bias blind spot. Bias blind spot does, however, appear to increase susceptibility to related biases.

<text>Acetobacteraceae is a family of Gram-negative bacteria, belonging to the order Rhodospirillales, class Alphaproteobacteria. Two distinct clades are recognized: the acetic acid bacteria and a more heterogeneous group including acidophilic and phototrophic bacteria. The type genus is &quot;Acetobacter&quot;. Ten genera from &quot;Acetobacteraceae&quot; make up the acetic acid bacteria.

==History==
&quot;Acetobacteraceae&quot; was originally proposed as a family for &quot;Acetobacter&quot; and &quot;Gluconobacter&quot; based on rRNA and DNA–DNA hybridization comparisons in 1980.

<text>The Rhodospirillaceae are a family of Pseudomonadota. The majority are purple nonsulfur bacteria, producing energy through photosynthesis; originally all purple nonsulfur bacteria were included here.

They are often found in anaerobic aquatic environments, such as mud and stagnant water, although they are able to survive in air.

This family also includes &quot;Magnetospirillum&quot;, which contains tiny chains of magnetite. These let it sense the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, which runs downwards as well as north or south, to return to the bottom of a pond (magnetotaxis). Similar magnetite chains found in Martian meteorites have been suggested as evidence of life on Mars.

<text>The following is a list and brief history of the bridges in Cambridge, England, principally those over the River Cam of which there are 26 (as of 2021).

The River Cam enters Cambridge from the south west of the city and heads north past many of the historic colleges of the University of Cambridge along the open area known as The Backs. After passing St John&#x27;s College, it turns sharply and runs east, passing the weir at Jesus Green and the boathouses alongside Midsummer Common. Passing Chesterton, it turns north again and leaves the city, running a further before merging with the Great Ouse at Pope&#x27;s Corner to the south of Ely.

== Bridges over the River Cam (south to north) ==

=== Upper River (upstream of mill pond weir) ===

==== Trumpington Bridge (1790) ====
The most upstream bridge in Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency) lies along Grantchester Road between Grantchester and Trumpington. Also known as Brasel Bridge, this 1790 brick bridge replaced a wooden bridge at the site of a ford.

==== Sheep&#x27;s Green Bridge (1910) ====

Footbridge linking Coe Fen behind The Leys School over a second small bridge to Lammas Land, near the area known as Hobson&#x27;s Paradise. Closed in the second quarter of 2006 to replace the steps with ramps to make it easier for cyclists and prams to cross. The bridge decking was also replaced.

==== Fen Causeway Bridge (1926)====

The first road bridge that is reached as the river enters the city. The road was formally opened on 9 December 1926.

==== Crusoe Bridge (1898–99) ====

A steel footbridge with timber deck and supported on four cast-iron columns, linking Sheep&#x27;s Green and Coe Fen, and the final bridge on the &#x27;Upper River&#x27; before it reaches the small weir at the mill pond.

=== Middle River (between mill pond weir and Jesus Green weir) ===

==== Darwin College Bridges ====
Two wooden bridges within the college grounds connecting the main site with the college&#x27;s two islands.

==== Silver Street Bridge (1958) ====

The site of bridges back to the 14th century, a cast iron bridge was built in 1843 but increasing heavy traffic led to a 1913 survey that determined the need for a new bridge. Repairs, however, allowed the bridge to last for a further 40 years. The present wide bridge, clad in Portland stone was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1932 and built in 1958–9.

==== Mathematical Bridge, Queens&#x27; College (1902) ====
This is the third version of the design, first built in 1749.

==== King&#x27;s College Bridge (1819) ====

The first bridge on the site was built in the 15th century, but situated around 20 metres to the north, and was rebuilt several times before moving to the present incarnation in 1819, designed by William Wilkins and built by Francis Braidwood.

==== Clare College Bridge (1640) ====
The oldest of Cambridge&#x27;s current bridges, this bridge in classical style was built in 1639–40 by Thomas Grumbold (d.1659). Many different stories are told to explain the missing section of the globe second from the left on the south side of the bridge. One rumour is that the builder of the bridge received (what he considered to be) insufficient payment, and in his anger, removed a segment of the globe; another is that complete bridges were subject to a tax at the time it was built, and the missing segment made the bridge incomplete and hence untaxed.

==== Garret Hostel Bridge (1960) ====

At least the eighth bridge on this site on Garret Hostel Lane between the colleges of Trinity and Trinity Hall. The current design is by Timothy Guy Morgan, who at the time was an undergraduate student at Jesus College, after an open competition. Morgan died in 1960, before the bridge was completed. It was one of the first post-tensioned concrete bridges in the country. Known to students locally as “orgasm bridge”.

==== Trinity College Bridge (1764) ====

Designed by James Essex, it replaced a stone bridge built in 1651, which in turn replaced a stone bridge pulled down in 1643 by Cromwellian soldiers as a defence during the English Civil War.
It is a Grade I listed building.

==== Kitchen Bridge, St John&#x27;s College (1709–11) ====

Also known as St John&#x27;s Old Bridge. The second oldest of Cambridge&#x27;s remaining bridges, built by Robert Grumbold (1639–1720) according to designs by Sir Christopher Wren. The bridge was crafted from a single block of limestone, carved to give the appearance of masonry. 

==== Bridge of Sighs, St John&#x27;s College (1831) ====

Also known as New Court Bridge, it is probably Cambridge&#x27;s best-known bridge, designed by Henry Hutchinson and based on a similarly named bridge in Venice, although the only real similarity between them is that they are both covered bridges over waterways.. (A bridge in Oxford, also nicknamed &quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot; but more reminiscent of the Rialto Bridge, links two sites of Hertford College, but it bridges New College Lane rather than a waterway.)

==== Magdalene Bridge (1823) ====

Named after Magdalene College, which stands nearby. It is very close to the location of the Roman ford (around 50 AD), and the location of the first Roman bridge in Cambridge (probably re-built by Offa in the 8th century). The current bridge was designed by Arthur Browne in Gothic revival style and was rebuilt in the same style in 1982.

=== Lower River (downstream of Jesus Green weir) ===

==== Jesus Lock footbridge (1892) ====

An iron bridge over the weir that divides the &#x27;Middle River&#x27; from the &#x27;Lower River&#x27;, where punting gives way to rowing.

==== Victoria Bridge (1890) ====

Allowed the residents of Chesterton easy access to the city for the first time. The foundation stone was laid by Frederic Wace, mayor of Cambridge, on 4 November 1889 and the bridge was officially opened by Wace on 11 December 1890. The bridge was rebuilt for strengthening in 1992.

==== Fort St George footbridge, Midsummer Common (1927) ====
Named after the Fort St George pub near its southern end, the site was previously home to a ferry that was &quot;probably the busiest of all the river crossings, running from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m&quot;. The bridge was built in 1927, and is now open for use by cyclists.

==== Cutter Ferry Bridge (2005) ====

A pedestrian and cycle bridge that links Cutter Ferry Lane with Midsummer Common. The original footbridge was closed in 2003 after over 75 years of service, and removed during December 2004. The replacement, over which cyclists may legally cycle, was opened on 20 May 2005. Also known by Cambridge residents as Pye&#x27;s Bridge because of the one-time nearby Pye electronics factory, and by student rowers as Emma Bridge because of its proximity to Emmanuel College Boathouse.

==== Elizabeth Way Bridge (1971) ====

A plain four-lane concrete road bridge, opened by Lord Butler in his capacity as High Steward of Cambridge on 13 July 1971, this is Cambridge&#x27;s most recent road bridge. The opening caused a few minutes of embarrassment when Lord Butler&#x27;s golden scissors failed to cut the ribbon across the road. The bridge forms part of Elizabeth Way (A1134).

==== Equiano Bridge (formerly Riverside Bridge) (2008) ====

This foot and cycle bridge connects Chesterton and Riverside near the Museum of Technology. Construction work began in April 2007, and the bridge opened to the public on 5 June 2008. It cost £3.1 million and was partially funded by Tesco to provide increased access to its Newmarket Road store. On 31 October 2022 it was renamed to honour writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano who had links to the Cambridge area. Days afterwards, the northern bank of the bridge became the scene of the first London drugs gang related homicide in Cambridge, with one of the perpetrators being described in court as a victim of modern slavery.

==== Green Dragon bridge, Stourbridge Common (1935) ====
Named after the Green Dragon pub opposite its northern end, the iron-arch bridge was built in 1935, causing the closure of the nearby Horse Grind and Pike &amp; Eel ferries. Also known to student rowers as &#x27;Chesterton Footbridge&#x27; as it crosses over what they know as &#x27;Chesterton Corner&#x27;.

==== Railway Bridge ====
Crosses the river through east Chesterton, south of the A14 bridge. It is the third railway bridge to be built on this site, replacing a plain plate girder bridge which stood on the site between 1870 and 1930, which itself replaced a wooden bridge built in 1846.

==== Abbey-Chesterton Bridge (2021) ====

The Abbey-Chesterton Bridge was installed on 8 November 2020 at Ditton Meadows, immediately downstream (east) of the railway girder bridge. This bridge carries the Chisholm Trail over the River Cam. Estimated cost is £4.5 million. The Abbey-Chesterton Bridge was opened by Jim Chisholm at 13:30 on 23 December 2021. 

==== A14 Bridge ====

Known (incorrectly) to rowers and others as the &quot;Motorway Bridge&quot;. Built as part of the &#x27;Cambridge northern bypass&#x27;, which opened in 1977, the bridge crosses the river just south of Baits Bite Lock. This bridge is also sometimes referred to as “Bovis Bridge” or &quot;Newnham Bridge&quot;.

==== Footbridge over the weir, Baits Bite Lock ====

An elevated footbridge crosses Baits Bite Lock in Milton to a narrow islet. A concrete-arch footbridge then crosses the weir to the east bank near Horningsea.

== Other bridges ==
* The Tony Carter bridge is a covered cycle bridge over the railway just north of Cambridge railway station opened in 1989. It was listed at the time in the Guinness Book of Records as the world&#x27;s longest covered cycle bridge. It is named after a Labour councillor of the era.
* The Jane Coston bridge was opened over the A14 in 2004, allowing cyclists and pedestrians to cross from Cowley Road to Milton. It has a central span of .. Jane Coston is a councillor who campaigned for 8 years for the bridge to be built.
* Coldham&#x27;s Lane bridge is a cycle and pedestrian bridge over the railway on the south side of Coldham&#x27;s Lane. It is not a particularly effective route for cyclists, especially those travelling south east.
* The Newmarket Road Bridge, the Mill Road Bridge near Cambridge Station, the Hills Road Bridge and the Long Road Bridge are other bridges over the railway.
* Cambridgeshire Guided Busway: A14 bridge, Hills Road Bridge, Long Road Bridge, Shelford Road Bridge and Hauxton Road Bridge on former railway lines, plus a new Addenbrooke&#x27;s Bridge leading over the railway line to the hospital.

<text>Douglas L. Allison (July 12, 1846 – December 19, 1916) was an American Major League Baseball player. He began his career as a catcher for the original Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional baseball team. Allison was one of the first catchers to stand directly behind the batter, as a means to prevent baserunners from stealing bases. He was considered a specialist, at a time when some of the better batsmen who manned the position normally rested, or substituted at other fielding positions. Allison became the earliest known player to use a type of baseball glove when he donned buckskin mittens to protect his hands in 1870.

Prior to his baseball career, Allison served as a private in Company L of the 192nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. His brother Art Allison also played in the Major Leagues.

==Career==
===Cincinnati Red Stockings===
Not quite 22 years old, Allison moved to Cincinnati for the 1868 season and played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings managed by Harry Wright. Open professionalism was one year away but the long move from Philadelphia, where he worked as a bricklayer, suggests that Allison was somehow compensated by club members, if not by the club. Cincinnati fielded a strong team that year, with five of the famous team already in place. Allison was a defensive specialist, whose job was simply to catch pitcher Asa Brainard.

Most catchers of Allison&#x27;s era stood twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter. His technique of moving closer to the batter proved effective in curtailing baserunners from stealing bases. In the 1860s, it was common for teams to score fifty or sixty runs a game, but as the technique of moving closer to the batter became more widespread among other catchers, run production began to plummet, helping usher in what became known as the dead-ball era.

When the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) permitted professionalism, the Red Stockings hired five incumbents including Allison and five new men to complete its roster, the first team that consisted of salaried players. A few of the others had previously played some catcher (all played at the six infield positions in 1868), but Allison filled the role in almost every game. Cincinnati toured the continent undefeated in 1869 and may have been the strongest team in 1870, but the club dropped professional base ball after the second season.

===Later career===
Harry Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, where he signed three teammates for . The other five regulars including Allison signed with Nick Young&#x27;s Washington Olympics, an established club that also joined the new, entirely professional National Association (NA). The five former Red Stockings led the Olympics to a respectable finish in the inaugural NA season.

Later, Doug Allison played in the Major Leagues with the Troy Haymakers in , the Brooklyn Eckfords in , the Elizabeth Resolutes in , the New York Mutuals from to , the Hartford Dark Blues from to , the Providence Grays from to , and one game with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association in .

==Later life==
Allison was reported playing for a post office team in 1882. Thirty-four years later he died in a car accident in Washington, D.C., at age 70, en route to his job at the Post Office Department. He is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington.

<doc id="893696" wikidata="Q980142" url="?curid=893696" title="Linguistic universal">
<text>A linguistic universal is a pattern that occurs systematically across natural languages, potentially true for all of them. For example, &quot;All languages have nouns and verbs&quot;, or &quot;If a language is spoken, it has consonants and vowels.&quot; Research in this area of linguistics is closely tied to the study of linguistic typology, and intends to reveal generalizations across languages, likely tied to cognition, perception, or other abilities of the mind. The field originates from discussions influenced by Noam Chomsky&#x27;s proposal of a Universal Grammar, but was largely pioneered by the linguist Joseph Greenberg, who derived a set of forty-five basic universals, mostly dealing with syntax, from a study of some thirty languages.

Though there has been significant research into linguistic universals, in more recent time some linguists, including Nicolas Evans and Stephen C. Levinson, have argued against the existence of absolute linguistic universals that are shared across all languages. These linguists cite problems such as ethnocentrism amongst cognitive scientists, and thus linguists, as well as insufficient research into all of the world&#x27;s languages in discussions related to linguistic universals, instead promoting these similarities as simply strong tendencies.

==Terminology==
Linguists distinguish between two kinds of universals: (opposite: , often called ) and (opposite: ). Absolute universals apply to every known language and are quite few in number; an example is &quot;All languages have pronouns&quot;. An implicational universal applies to languages with a particular feature that is always accompanied by another feature, such as &quot;If a language has trial grammatical number, it also has dual grammatical number&quot;, while non-implicational universals just state the existence (or non-existence) of one particular feature.

Also in contrast to absolute universals are , statements that may not be true for all languages but nevertheless are far too common to be the result of chance. They also have implicational and non-implicational forms. An example of the latter would be &quot;The vast majority of languages have nasal consonants&quot;. However, most tendencies, like their universal counterparts, are implicational. For example, &quot;With overwhelmingly greater-than-chance frequency, languages with normal SOV order are postpositional&quot;. Strictly speaking, a tendency is not a kind of universal, but exceptions to most statements called universals can be found. For example, Latin is an SOV language with prepositions. Often it turns out that these exceptional languages are undergoing a shift from one type of language to another. In the case of Latin, its descendant Romance languages switched to SVO, which is a much more common order among prepositional languages.

Universals may also be or . In a bidirectional universal two features each imply the existence of each other. For example, languages with postpositions usually have SOV order, and likewise SOV languages usually have postpositions. The implication works both ways, and thus the universal is bidirectional. By contrast, in a unidirectional universal the implication works only one way. Languages that place relative clauses before the noun they modify again usually have SOV order, so pre-nominal relative clauses imply SOV. On the other hand, SOV languages worldwide show little preference for pre-nominal relative clauses, and thus SOV implies little about the order of relative clauses. As the implication works only one way, the proposed universal is a unidirectional one.

Linguistic universals in syntax are sometimes held up as evidence for universal grammar (although epistemological arguments are more common). Other explanations for linguistic universals have been proposed, for example, that linguistic universals tend to be properties of language that aid communication. If a language were to lack one of these properties, it has been argued, it would probably soon evolve into a language having that property.

Michael Halliday has argued for a distinction between and categories in resolving the matter of the existence of linguistic universals, a distinction he takes from J.R. Firth and Louis Hjelmslev. He argues that &quot;theoretical categories, and their inter-relations construe an abstract model of language...; they are interlocking and mutually defining&quot;. Descriptive categories, by contrast, are those set up to describe particular languages. He argues that &quot;When people ask about &#x27;universals&#x27;, they usually mean descriptive categories that are assumed to be found in all languages. The problem is there is no mechanism for deciding how much alike descriptive categories from different languages have to be before they are said to be &#x27;the same thing&#x27;&quot;.

== Universal grammar ==

Noam Chomsky&#x27;s work related to the innateness hypothesis as it pertains to our ability to rapidly learn any language without formal instruction and with limited input, or what he refers to as a poverty of the stimulus, is what began research into linguistic universals. This led to his proposal for a shared underlying grammar structure for all languages, a concept he called &quot;universal grammar&quot; (UG), which he claimed must exist somewhere in the human brain prior to language acquisition. Chomsky defines UG as &quot;the system of principles, conditions, and rules that are elements or properties of all human languages... by necessity.&quot; He states that UG expresses &quot;the essence of human language,&quot; and believes that the structure-dependent rules of UG allow humans to interpret and create an infinite number of novel grammatical sentences. Chomsky asserts that UG is the underlying connection between all languages and that the various differences between languages are all relative with respect to UG. He claims that UG is essential to our ability to learn languages, and thus uses it as evidence in a discussion of how to form a potential &#x27;theory of learning&#x27; for how humans learn all or most of our cognitive processes throughout our lives. The discussion of Chomsky&#x27;s UG, its innateness, and its connection to how humans learn language has been one of the more covered topics in linguistics studies to date. However, there is division amongst linguists between those who support Chomsky&#x27;s claims of UG and those who argued against the existence of an underlying shared grammar structure that can account for all languages.

==Semantics==
In semantics, research into linguistic universals has taken place in a number of ways. Some linguists, starting with Gottfried Leibniz, have pursued the search for a hypothetic irreducible semantic core of all languages. A modern variant of this approach can be found in the natural semantic metalanguage of Anna Wierzbicka and associates. See, for example, and Other lines of research suggest cross-linguistic tendencies to use body part terms metaphorically as adpositions, or tendencies to have morphologically simple words for cognitively salient concepts. The human body, being a physiological universal, provides an ideal domain for research into semantic and lexical universals. In a seminal study, Cecil H. Brown (1976) proposed a number of universals in the semantics of body part terminology, including the following: in any language, there will be distinct terms for , , , , , and ; if there is a distinct term for , there will be a distinct term for ; similarly, if there are terms for , then there are terms for . Subsequent research has shown that most of these features have to be considered cross-linguistic tendencies rather than true universals. Several languages like Tidore and Kuuk Thaayorre lack a general term meaning &#x27;body&#x27;. On the basis of such data it has been argued that the highest level in the partonomy of body part terms would be the word for &#x27;person&#x27;.

Some other examples of proposed linguistic universals in semantics include the idea that all languages possess words with the meaning &#x27;(biological) mother&#x27; and &#x27;you (second person singular pronoun)&#x27; as well as statistical tendencies of meanings of basic color terms in relation to the number of color terms used by a respective language. Some theories of color naming suggest that if a language possesses only two terms for describing color, their respective meanings will be &#x27;black&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27; (or perhaps &#x27;dark&#x27; and &#x27;light&#x27;), and if a language possesses more than two color terms, then the additional terms will follow trends related to the focal colors, which are determined by the physiology of how color is perceived, rather than linguistics. Thus, if a language possesses three color terms, the third will mean &#x27;red&#x27;, and if a language possesses four color terms, the next will mean &#x27;yellow&#x27; or &#x27;green&#x27;. If there are five color terms, then both &#x27;yellow&#x27; and &#x27;green&#x27; are added, if six, then &#x27;blue&#x27; is added, and so on.

== Counterarguments ==
Nicolas Evans and Stephen C. Levinson are two linguists who have written against the existence of linguistic universals, making a particular mention towards issues with Chomsky&#x27;s proposal for a Universal Grammar. They argue that across the 6,000-8,000 languages spoken around the world today, there are merely strong tendencies rather than universals at best. In their view, these arise primarily due to the fact that many languages are connected to one another through shared historical backgrounds or common lineage, such as group Romance languages in Europe that were all derived from ancient Latin, and therefore it can be expected that they share some core similarities. Evans and Levinson believe that linguists who have previously proposed or supported concepts associated with linguistic universals have done so &quot;under the assumption that most languages are English-like in their structure&quot; and only after analyzing a limited range of languages. They identify ethnocentrism, the idea &quot;that most cognitive scientists, linguists included, speak only familiar European languages, all close cousins in structure,&quot; as a possible influence towards the various issues they identify in the assertions made on linguistic universals. With regards to Chomsky&#x27;s universal grammar, these linguists claim that the explanation of the structure and rules applied to UG are either false due to a lack of detail into the various constructions used when creating or interpreting a grammatical sentence, or that the theory is unfalsifiable due to the vague and oversimplified assertions made by Chomsky. Instead, Evans and Levinson highlight the vast diversity that exists amongst the many languages spoken around the world to advocate for further investigation into the many cross-linguistic variations that do exist. Their article promotes linguistic diversity by citing multiple examples of variation in how &quot;languages can be structured at every level: phonetic, phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic.&quot; They claim that increased understanding and acceptance of linguistic diversity over the concepts of false claims of linguistic universals, better stated to them as strong tendencies, will lead to more enlightening discoveries in the studies of human cognition.

<doc id="893698" wikidata="Q4455030" url="?curid=893698" title="Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups">
<text>In mathematics, Stone&#x27;s theorem on one-parameter unitary groups is a basic theorem of functional analysis that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space formula_1 and one-parameter families

:formula_2

of unitary operators that are strongly continuous, i.e.,

:formula_3

and are homomorphisms, i.e.,

:formula_4

Such one-parameter families are ordinarily referred to as strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups.

The theorem was proved by , and showed that the requirement that formula_5 be strongly continuous can be relaxed to say that it is merely weakly measurable, at least when the Hilbert space is separable.

This is an impressive result, as it allows one to define the derivative of the mapping formula_6 which is only supposed to be continuous. It is also related to the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras.

== Formal statement ==
The statement of the theorem is as follows. 

:Theorem. Let formula_5 be a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Then there exists a unique (possibly unbounded) operator formula_8, that is self-adjoint on formula_9 and such that
::formula_10 
:The domain of formula_11 is defined by 
::formula_12
:Conversely, let formula_8 be a (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operator on formula_14 Then the one-parameter family formula_2 of unitary operators defined by 
::formula_16
:is a strongly continuous one-parameter group.

In both parts of the theorem, the expression formula_17 is defined by means of the functional calculus, which uses the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators. 

The operator formula_11 is called the infinitesimal generator of formula_19 Furthermore, formula_11 will be a bounded operator if and only if the operator-valued mapping formula_21 is norm-continuous.

The infinitesimal generator formula_11 of a strongly continuous unitary group formula_2 may be computed as

:formula_24

with the domain of formula_11 consisting of those vectors formula_26 for which the limit exists in the norm topology. That is to say, formula_11 is equal to formula_28 times the derivative of formula_29 with respect to formula_30 at formula_31. Part of the statement of the theorem is that this derivative exists—i.e., that formula_11 is a densely defined self-adjoint operator. The result is not obvious even in the finite-dimensional case, since formula_29 is only assumed (ahead of time) to be continuous, and not differentiable.

== Example ==

The family of translation operators

:formula_34

is a one-parameter unitary group of unitary operators; the infinitesimal generator of this family is an extension of the differential operator

:formula_35

defined on the space of continuously differentiable complex-valued functions with compact support on formula_36 Thus

:formula_37

In other words, motion on the line is generated by the momentum operator.

== Applications ==

Stone&#x27;s theorem has numerous applications in quantum mechanics. For instance, given an isolated quantum mechanical system, with Hilbert space of states , time evolution is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on formula_1. The infinitesimal generator of this group is the system Hamiltonian.

==Using Fourier transform==

Stone&#x27;s Theorem can be recast using the language of the Fourier transform. The real line formula_39 is a locally compact abelian group. Non-degenerate *-representations of the group C*-algebra formula_40 are in one-to-one correspondence with strongly continuous unitary representations of formula_41 i.e., strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups. On the other hand, the Fourier transform is a *-isomorphism from formula_40 to formula_43 the formula_44-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on the real line that vanish at infinity. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups and *-representations of formula_45 As every *-representation of formula_46 corresponds uniquely to a self-adjoint operator, Stone&#x27;s Theorem holds.

Therefore, the procedure for obtaining the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group is as follows:

* Let formula_2 be a strongly continuous unitary representation of formula_39 on a Hilbert space formula_1.
* Integrate this unitary representation to yield a non-degenerate *-representation formula_50 of formula_40 on formula_1 by first defining formula_53 and then extending formula_50 to all of formula_40 by continuity.
* Use the Fourier transform to obtain a non-degenerate *-representation formula_56 of formula_57 on formula_1.
* By the Riesz-Markov Theorem, formula_56 gives rise to a projection-valued measure on formula_39 that is the resolution of the identity of a unique self-adjoint operator formula_11, which may be unbounded.
* Then formula_11 is the infinitesimal generator of formula_63

The precise definition of formula_40 is as follows. Consider the *-algebra formula_65 the continuous complex-valued functions on formula_39 with compact support, where the multiplication is given by convolution. The completion of this *-algebra with respect to the formula_67-norm is a Banach *-algebra, denoted by formula_68 Then formula_40 is defined to be the enveloping formula_44-algebra of formula_71, i.e., its completion with respect to the largest possible formula_44-norm. It is a non-trivial fact that, via the Fourier transform, formula_40 is isomorphic to formula_45 A result in this direction is the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma, which says that the Fourier transform maps formula_75 to formula_45

== Generalizations ==

The Stone–von Neumann theorem generalizes Stone&#x27;s theorem to a &quot;pair&quot; of self-adjoint operators, formula_77, satisfying the canonical commutation relation, and shows that these are all unitarily equivalent to the position operator and momentum operator on formula_78

The Hille–Yosida theorem generalizes Stone&#x27;s theorem to strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups of contractions on Banach spaces.

<text>Yvonne Mitchell (born Yvonne Frances Joseph; 7 July 1915 – 24 March 1979) was an English actress and author. After beginning her acting career in theatre, Mitchell progressed to films in the late 1940s. Her roles include Julia in the 1954 BBC adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. She retired from acting in 1977.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born Yvonne Frances Joseph, but in 1946 changed her name by deed poll to Yvonne Mitchell (without the Frances). Her parents were Madge (Mitchell) and Bertie Joseph. Her cousin was Conservative MP Keith Joseph. She was Jewish and was educated in Sussex at Battle Abbey School and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in London.

==Acting==
Mitchell trained for an acting career at the London Theatre Studio, making her professional debut in 1939. Already an experienced stage actress, she made her speaking film debut in &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (1949), although she played an uncredited minor role in &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; eight years earlier.

She had several prominent film roles over the next three decades, winning a British Film Award for &quot;The Divided Heart&quot; (1954) and the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;Woman in a Dressing Gown&quot; (1957). She appeared as Mildred in the controversial film &quot;Sapphire&quot; (1959).

Mitchell was voted &#x27;Television Actress of the Year&#x27; for 1953 by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper, mainly for her role as Cathy in the Nigel Kneale/Rudolph Cartier adaptation of Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The next year, she appeared in another Kneale/Cartier literary adaptation in the role of Julia, with Peter Cushing as Winston Smith, in their adaptation of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

She starred as Lea in the 1973 BBC TV production of Colette&#x27;s &quot;Cheri&quot;. She continued to appear in television guest roles until the late 1970s, in series such as &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; (in 1966); her final screen role was in the BBC science-fiction series &quot;1990&quot; (1977).

==Writing==
Outside acting, Mitchell was also an established author, writing several books for children and adults as well as winning awards for playwriting. Her plays include &quot;The Same Sky&quot;. She wrote an acclaimed biography of the French writer Colette, and her own autobiography was published in 1957.

==Personal life==

Mitchell was married to the journalist, film and theatre critic and novelist Derek Monsey (1921–1979) and they lived in a village in the south of France.

Mitchell died of cancer, aged 63, in 1979. Monsey died the same year, roughly one month earlier. Their daughter Cordelia Monsey is a theatre director and a long-term associate of both Sir Peter Hall and Sir Trevor Nunn. Yvonne Mitchell&#x27;s grandson is the drummer and violinist, Mitch McGugan.

<doc id="893708" wikidata="Q1439993" url="?curid=893708" title="Four square">
<text>Four square (also called handball, champ, four squares or box ball) is a global sport played on a square court divided by two perpendicular lines into four identical boxes creating four squares labelled 1–4 or A–D. 

Four square is a popular game at elementary schools with little required equipment, almost no setup, and short rounds of play that can be ended at any time. The game also has a large following for adults in many communities.

==History==
Four square dates to at least the 1950s. A game called four square is mentioned in newspapers in the northeastern United States at least as far back as the 1950s, but the rules are not explained. A 1953 teacher&#x27;s manual describes four square with the same rules used today. However, it is possible this game could have evolved from &quot;Jeu de paume&quot;, a game popular in France as early as the twelfth century. 

==Rules==
Four square is played on any hard-surfaced court, such as wood, concrete or asphalt. There is no official court size, but typically courts measure between on a side, and divided into four smaller squares labelled 1–4 of equal size.

Rules vary, but there are two common objectives. The first is to have the most points when the game ends, where 1 point is awarded to the person in square 4 (the server) each turn. The second is to be the last player who hasn&#x27;t been eliminated by obtaining a predetermined number of &quot;outs&quot;.

One player occupies each of the 4 squares at a time; the other players wait in line. The player in square 4 serves the ball into another square. Once the ball bounces into a square, the player who occupies that square must hit the ball into another square with their hands, and so on, until someone gets out. Each time a player gets out, that player leaves the court and enters the back of the line and all remaining players advance to the higher numbered square (if applicable). Square 1 is then filled with a new player from the line of awaiting players.

A player may get out as follows:
* Failing to hit the ball into another square
* Allowing the ball to bounce more than once in their own square
* Hitting the ball out of the squares or hitting a line
* Hitting the ball incorrectly such as by holding, catching, or carrying
* Hitting the ball out of turn or committing interference
* Hitting the ball one handed (in some versions of gameplay)

==Variations== 
Four square has inspired other similar games. One example is nine square, which uses a 3-by-3 grid instead of a 2-by-2 grid. The 9 square is the middle and the ball is served from this position. Another version is played similar to the original in that four players occupy their respective spots, but they must keep the ball off the ground like in volleyball.

The game is called King Out in Sweden. A similar schoolyard game is called handball.

==World Championships==
Since 2005, Bridgton, ME, has hosted the annual World Four Square Championships where adults and children compete to determine the world&#x27;s best four square players.

==World records==
On August 4–5, 2012, a group of 17 Needham High School students and alumni — assisted by 50 other Needham residents at various times — broke the previous world record by playing for 34 hours, the previous record being held by 15 Manchester College students who played the game for 30 hours. The world record was held by eight Argentinean players for 29 hours in 2008, as recognized by Guinness World Records. The Argentinean record was preceded by a group of teens from Youngstown, Ohio, who also played for 29 hours.

==Common terms==
Many terms are used for specific techniques that can be allowed or banned by the primary square:
* A &quot;sticky&quot; refers to holding the ball. Specified time (in seconds) is decided by the primary square.
* &quot;Popcorns&quot; are taking the ball and throwing it in the air before hitting it. The amount of popcorns before returning the ball is also decided by the primary square.
* A &quot;school bus&quot; is when a player calls out said phrase. All player in the four squares must run to the center of the four squares and put their foot at the intersection. The last to do so has lost the round.

<text>Design by committee is a pejorative term for a project that has many designers involved but no unifying plan or vision.

==Usage of the term==

The term is used to refer to suboptimal traits that such a process may produce as a result of having to compromise between the requirements and viewpoints of the participants, particularly in the presence of poor leadership or poor technical knowledge, such as needless complexity, internal inconsistency, logical flaws, banality, and the lack of a unifying vision. This design process by consensus is in contrast to autocratic design, or design by dictator, where the project leader decides on the design. The difference is that in an autocratic style, members of the organizations are not included and the final outcome is the responsibility of the leader. The phrase, &quot;a camel is a horse designed by committee&quot; is often used to describe design by committee.

The term is especially common in technical parlance; and stresses the need for technical quality over political feasibility. The proverb &quot;&quot; expresses the same idea. The term is also common in other fields of design such as graphic design, architecture or industrial design. In automotive design, this process is often blamed for unpopular or poorly designed cars.

== Examples ==
The term is commonly used in information and communications technology, especially when referring to the design of languages and technical standards, as demonstrated by USENET archives.

An alleged example is the DR Class 119 diesel locomotive, built from 1976 to 1985 in communist Romania for East Germany due to Soviet-era Comecon restrictions. Only the USSR was allowed to continue building powerful diesel engines, but they were too heavy for East Germany where some lines were limited to low axle load locomotives. Not allowed to continue building their own designs, the East Germans managed to have Romanian &quot;23 August Works&quot; assemble a successor to the DR Class 118. With a mixture of parts from several planned economy countries, even including West German designs to fill gaps, the Class 119 was unreliable. Only 200 were built in ten years as East Germany cancelled the contract prematurely. No other country purchased the Class 119, but after 1990 unified German rail had to deal with them until they were replaced.

An example of a technical decision said to be a typical result of design by committee is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell size of 53 bytes. The choice of 53 bytes was political rather than technical. When the CCITT was standardizing ATM, parties from the United States wanted a 64-byte payload. Parties from Europe wanted 32-byte payloads. Most of the European parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the Americans, but France and a few others held out for a shorter cell length of 32 bytes. A 53-byte size (48 bytes plus 5 byte header) was the compromise chosen.

An example described as naming by committee was a school near Liverpool formed by the merger of several other schools: it was officially named the &quot;Knowsley Park Centre for Learning, Serving Prescot, Whiston and the Wider Community&quot; in 2009, listing as a compromise all the schools and communities merged into it. The name lasted seven years before its headmistress, who called the name &quot;so embarrassing&quot;, cut it to simply &quot;The Prescot School&quot;.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been described as designed by committee, due to being overscheduled, over budget, and underperforming expectations. It was originally conceived to serve the widely varying needs of multiple branches of the military all in one simple platform. This multi-interest approach has been pinpointed as largely responsible for its bloat, along with stacking too many new and unproven features into its design. Uneven progress across areas and unexpected challenges meant that major technical fixes and redesigns could halt the program&#x27;s movement, requiring planes to be remedied even as they were being delivered.

Apple Inc. reportedly uses remote controls designed by other companies with as many as 78 buttons as an example of design by committee when training employees.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the Pontiac Aztek as a vehicle designed by committee, which was largely designed based on feedback from extensive focus group testing, and was released to negative reviews and poor sales.

<text>In abstract algebra, especially in the area of group theory, a strong generating set of a permutation group is a generating set that clearly exhibits the permutation structure as described by a stabilizer chain. A stabilizer chain is a sequence of subgroups, each containing the next and each stabilizing one more point.

Let formula_1 be a group of permutations of the set formula_2 Let 

:formula_3 

be a sequence of distinct integers, formula_4 such that the pointwise stabilizer of formula_5 is trivial (i.e., let formula_5 be a base for formula_7). Define 

:formula_8

and define formula_9 to be the pointwise stabilizer of formula_10. A strong generating set (SGS) for G relative to the base formula_5 is a set 

:formula_12 

such that 

:formula_13 

for each formula_14 such that formula_15.

The base and the SGS are said to be non-redundant if 

:formula_16 

for formula_17.

A base and strong generating set (BSGS) for a group can be computed using the Schreier–Sims algorithm.

<text>The United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee (in case citations, W.D. Tenn.) is the federal district court covering the western part of the state of Tennessee. Appeals from the Western District of Tennessee are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

== Jurisdiction ==
The jurisdiction of the Western District of Tennessee comprises the following counties: Benton, Carroll, Chester, Crockett, Decatur, Dyer, Fayette, Gibson, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Henderson, Henry, Lake, Lauderdale, Madison, McNairy, Obion, Perry, Shelby, Tipton, and Weakley.

The court&#x27;s jurisdiction includes the entirety of West Tennessee, plus Perry County in Middle Tennessee. This area includes the cities of Jackson and Memphis.

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Western District of Tennessee represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. the Office of the United States attorney is vacant.

== History ==
The United States District Court for the District of Tennessee was established with one judgeship on January 31, 1797, by . The judgeship was filled by President George Washington&#x27;s appointment of John McNairy. Since Congress failed to assign the district to a circuit, the court had the jurisdiction of both a district court and a circuit court. Appeals from this one district court went directly to the United States Supreme Court.

On February 13, 1801, in the famous &quot;Midnight Judges&quot; Act of 1801, , Congress abolished the U.S. district court in Tennessee, and expanded the number of circuits to six, provided for independent circuit court judgeships, and abolished the necessity of Supreme Court Justices riding the circuits. It was this legislation which created the grandfather of the present Sixth Circuit. The act provided for a &quot;Sixth Circuit&quot; comprising two districts in the State of Tennessee, one district in the State of Kentucky and one district, called the Ohio District, composed of the Ohio and Indiana territories (the latter including the present State of Michigan). The new Sixth Circuit Court was to be held at &quot;Bairdstown&quot; in the District of Kentucky, at Knoxville in the District of East Tennessee, at Nashville in the District of West Tennessee, and at Cincinnati in the District of Ohio. Unlike the other circuits which were provided with three circuit judges, the Sixth Circuit was to have only one circuit judge with district judges from Kentucky and Tennessee comprising the rest of the court. Any two judges constituted a quorum. New circuit judgeships were to be created as district judgeships in Kentucky and Tennessee became vacant.

The repeal of this Act restored the District on March 8, 1802, . The District was divided into the Eastern and Western Districts on April 29, 1802. On February 24, 1807, Congress again abolished the two districts and created the United States Circuit for the District of Tennessee. On March 3, 1837, Congress assigned the judicial district of Tennessee to the Eighth Circuit. On June 18, 1839, by , Congress divided Tennessee into three districts, Eastern, Middle, and Western. Again, only one judgeship was allotted for all three districts. On July 15, 1862, Congress reassigned appellate jurisdiction to the Sixth Circuit. Finally, on June 14, 1878, Congress authorized a separate judgeship for the Western District of Tennessee. President Rutherford B. Hayes then appointed Eli Shelby Hammond as the first judge for only the Western District of Tennessee.

There are now five permanent judgeships and four magistrate judgeships for the Western District of Tennessee.

<text>Lednice (; ) is a municipality and village in Břeclav District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,300 inhabitants. It is known as part of Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Administrative division==
Lednice consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Lednice (1,858)
*Nejdek (213)

==Geography==
Lednice is located about northwest of Břeclav and south of Brno. It lies in a flat landscape in the Lower Morava Valley. The Thaya River flows through the northern part of the municipal territory. Stará Dyje and Zámecká Dyje, which are canals of the Thaya, also flow through the territory.

There are several large fishponds. Their territory, together with the immediate surroundings, is protected as the Lednické rybníky National Nature Reserve.

==History==
The first written mention of Lednice is from 1222 under its Latin name &quot;Izgruobi&quot;, as a property of the Weisen/Orphanus family. In the mid-13th century, it was passed into the hands of the House of Liechtenstein and its fortunes had been tied inseparably to the members of this noble family.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Lednice is known for viticulture and wine-making. The municipality lies in the Mikulovská wine subregion.

==Transport==
Lednice is the terminus of the short Břeclav–Lednice railway line that operates only on weekends from April to October. The line is operated with old rolling stock - steam engine pulled trains or diesel cars.

==Sights==

In 1996, the Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as &quot;an exceptional example of the designed landscape that evolved in the Enlightenment and afterwards under the care of a single family.&quot; Lednice contains a palace and the second largest castle park in the country, which covers .

The Lednice Castle was originally a Renaissance villa. In the 17th century it became a summer residence of the ruling Princes of Liechtenstein. The estate house, designed and furbished by baroque architects Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, Domenico Martinelli, and Anton Johan Ospel, proclaimed rural luxury on the grandest scale. In 1846–1858, it was extensively rebuilt in the neo-Gothic style under the supervision of Georg Wingelmüller.

The surrounding park is laid out in an English garden style and contains a range of Romantic follies by Joseph Hardtmuth, including the solitary high minaret from 1802, which is the tallest outside the Muslim world.

==Notable people==
*Princess Aloysia of Liechtenstein (1838–1920), Catholic worker
*Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein (1840–1929), monarch

<text>Lake Minnewanka () (&quot;Water of the Spirits&quot; in Nakoda) is a glacial lake in the eastern area of Banff National Park in Canada, about northeast of the Banff townsite. The lake is long and deep, making it the 2nd longest lake in the mountain parks of the Canadian Rockies (the result of a power dam at the west end).

The lake is fed by the Cascade River, flowing east of Cascade Mountain, and runs south through Stewart Canyon as it empties into the western end of the lake. Numerous streams flowing down from Mount Inglismaldie, Mount Girouard and Mount Peechee on the south side of the lake also feed the lake.

Aboriginal people long inhabited areas around Lake Minnewanka, as early as 10,000 years ago, according to stone tools and a Clovis point spearhead discovered by archaeologists. The area is rich in animal life (e.g. elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bears) and the easy availability of rock in the mountainous terrain was key to fashioning weapons for hunting.

The western end of the lake can be reached by following Lake Minnewanka road from the Trans-Canada Highway. Boat tours are available near the parking lot. A hiking and mountain biking trail runs along the northern shore of the lake, passing Stewart Canyon and six backcountry campsites. Mount Aylmer which at is the highest mountain in this area of the park, is located a few kilometres north of the lake.

The first dam was built in 1912 only to store water. While the National Parks Act was suspended during World War II the much larger embankment dam that still exists was constructed in 1941 and raised the lake . This resulted in the resort village of Minnewanka Landing, which had been there since 1888, being submerged and the Cascade River being diverted away from its old course, resulting in much of the riverbed downstream of the dam running dry for most of the year (except in rare high-water events when the dam&#x27;s spillway is opened). Most water from the Cascade River is diverted into Two Jack Lake, where it enters a 4-kilometre-long canal. From there it is funnelled into a pair of penstocks feeding two generators in the Cascade Powerhouse with a combined capacity of 34 MW. The facility is owned by TransAlta and supplies power to the Banff Townsite. In order to increase the amount of water entering the penstocks a small diversion dam was built on the Ghost River, which diverts additional water into Lake Minnewanka from the Ghost drainage. Because of the presence of the submerged village, submerged bridge pilings, and submerged dam (the one from 1912) the lake is popular among recreational scuba divers.
The construction of the dam resulted in involuntary resettlement of inhabitants from the reservoir area.

<text>Coordinadora Revolucionaria de Masas (Revolutionary Mass Coordination) was a coordination of revolutionary mass organizations in El Salvador formed on January 11, 1980.

The major action in its history was a January 22, 1980, demonstration, in commemoration of the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Between 200,000 and 350,000 people took to the streets this day in a country with just 5 million inhabitants. The security forces attacked the march with snipers located in the National Palace and other buildings in downtown San Salvador against the contingents of Frente de Acción Popular Unificado (United Popular Action Front) (FAPU) and Unión Democrática Nacionalista. The contingents of Bloque Popular Revolucionario and Ligas Populares 28 de Febrero (LP-28) had not yet begun to march when the demonstration was dissolved.

Later marches of the CRM were dispersed with particular dispatch by the National Guard, Hacienda Police, National Police and paramilitaries. The last big demonstration of the CRM occurred on March 24, 1980, during the funeral of Archbishop Óscar Romero, assassinated the week before. The repression of the march was brutal and the marchers began to leave the streets and the CRM devolved into a coordinating body of unions, student, farmer and worker groups. The last actions were during the general offensive of 1981 (la fallida).

Every organization in the CRM corresponded to a military-political organization.

*Bloque Popular Revolucionario, a mass front of Fuerzas Populares de Liberación “Farabundo Martí” founded on July 30, 1975
*Frente de Acción Popular Unificado (Unified Popular Action Front), mass front of Fuerzas Armadas de la Resistencia Nacional (National Resistance Armed Forces), founded in 1974
*Ligas Populares 28 de Febrero, (Popular League of February 28) mass front of Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo. LP-28 was founded in March 1977, through the struggles against electoral fraud that year.
*Unión Democrática Nacionalista (National Democratic Union) was a legal political party launched by the Communist Party of El Salvador

<doc id="893801" wikidata="Q542036" url="?curid=893801" title="Dolce Stil Novo">
<text> (, &#x27;sweet new style&#x27;) is the name given to a literary movement in 13th and 14th century Italy. Influenced by the Sicilian School and Tuscan poetry, its main theme is Divine Love. The name was used for the first time by Dante Alighieri in &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, the second canticle of the &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;. In the &quot;Divina Commedia&quot; Purgatory he meets Bonagiunta Orbicciani, a 13th-century Italian poet, who tells Dante that Dante himself, Guido Guinizelli, and Guido Cavalcanti had been able to create a new genre: a &quot;stil novo&quot;.

Poetry from this school is marked by adoration of the human form, incorporating vivid descriptions of female beauty and frequently comparing the desired woman to a creature from paradise. The woman is described as an &quot;angel&quot; or as &quot;a bridge to God&quot;. Rather than being material in nature, the Love of the is a sort of Divine Love. Poetry of this movement also often includes profound introspection. Many literary critics have argued that introspection in Italian literary works was first introduced by the &quot;Stil Novo&quot; poets, and later developed by Francesco Petrarca.The two main concepts (introspection and love) are thus brought together as the poet enters his interior world to express his most inner feelings, which are caused by an excessively divine female beauty. The first expression of this style of writing is credited to Guido Guinizelli and his poem &quot;Al cor gentil rempaira sempre amore&quot;. Precursors to the are found in the Provençal works of the troubadours, such as the Genoese Lanfranc Cigala. The artists of the stil novo are called &quot;stilnovisti&quot;.&quot;&quot;

The importance of the lies in the fact that apart from being the manifestation of the first true literary tradition in Italy, it ennobled the Tuscan vernacular, which was destined to become the Italian national language.

== In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot; ==
In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXIV, on the sixth terrace of Purgatory, the poet and glutton Bonagiunta Orbicciani, after confirming that Dante is the poet who wrote &quot;Ladies that have intelligence of love&quot;, a poem from &quot;Vita Nuova&quot;, uses the phrase (&quot;sweet new style&quot;, mentioned for the first time in the Italian vernacular) to describe Dante&#x27;s style as a poet, and how it marked a shift from the styles of poets that came before him like of Giacomo da Lentini and Guittone d&#x27;Arezzo.

Dante scholars have tried to define this &quot;sweet new style&quot;, and it remains a source of much contention. Dante, the character, claims &quot;I am one who, when Love inspires me, takes note, and, as he dictates within me, so I set it forth&quot; (&quot;Purg.&quot; XXIV, 52–54)&quot;.&quot; What &quot;Love&quot; means in this tercet has divided many Dante scholars, who question whether it is &quot;Amore&quot;, the god of Love, or whether it is another name for the Christian God. Robert Hollander hypothesizes that the phrase can be understood in theological terms. By using Bonagiunta to describe his style as , Dante is presenting himself as more than just a usual love poet because of the theological significance of Beatrice. Beatrice embodies God&#x27;s love for him, and she, who also acts as his guide, can lead to God. Hollander and Furio Brugnolo also argue that Cino da Pistoia, whom Dante believed was the only one who understood this significance of Beatrice, also falls in this &quot;school&quot; of poetry.

Dante scholar Zygmunt G. Barański states that the definition of the phrase should not be searched for externally as it can be found in the text of the poem itself: it is a style where form and content are in harmony, and this harmony is what makes the style &quot;sweet.&quot; Another word for &quot;dulcis&quot; is clarity, and Dante himself believed that for poetry to be sweet, it should be as intelligible as possible.

In the nineteenth century, scholars began considering and studying as a &quot;school&quot; of poetry. Scholars, to differentiate Dante&#x27;s use of the term to &quot;Purgatorio&quot; to the literary movement, called the movement &quot;stil nuovo&quot;.

<text>Frente Democrático Salvadoreño (FDS) (Salvadoran Democratic Front) was a broad front of democratic organizations that was formed in El Salvador in March, 1980. It consisted of, amongst others, Movimiento Independiente de Profesionales y Técnicos de El Salvador (MIPTES), Movimiento Popular Social Cristiano (MPSC), Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario (MNR), Trade Union federations, small business owners and a minor sector of dissident militaries. Amongst the militaries that joined FDS was the Colonel Ernesto Claramont, who had been the presidential candidate of National Opposition Union in 1977.

Two universities were affiliated as observers in FDS, Universidad de El Salvador and Universidad Centroamericana &quot;José Simeón Cañas&quot;.

After only 17 days of existence FDS merged with Revolutionary Mass Coordination to form Revolutionary Democratic Front.

<text>Robots is a 2005 American animated science fiction adventure comedy film produced by 20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The film was directed by Chris Wedge and co-directed by Carlos Saldanha from a screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire and the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, based on a story conceived by Lindsay-Abaire, Ron Mita and Jim McClain. It stars the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Amanda Bynes, Drew Carey and Robin Williams. The story follows an ambitious inventor robot named Rodney Copperbottom (voice of McGregor), who seeks his idol Bigweld (voice of Brooks) to work for his company in Robot City, but discovers a plot by its new leader Ratchet (voice of Kinnear) and his mother (voice of Jim Broadbent) to forcibly upgrade its populace and eradicate struggling robots, known as &quot;outmodes&quot;.

Development on the film began in 2000, when Wedge and children&#x27;s author William Joyce failed to adapt Joyce&#x27;s 1993 children&#x27;s book &quot;Santa Calls&quot;, thus scrapping the idea and instead doing a story on robots.

&quot;Robots&quot; premiered at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles, on March 6, 2005, and was released in the United States on March 11. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the film&#x27;s humor and creativity, but generally deemed its story and characters to be somewhat unoriginal and forgettable. The film was commercially successful, grossing $262.5 million worldwide against a $75–80 million budget. A sequel was discussed but never produced due to the studio&#x27;s heavier focus on its flagship franchise, &quot;Ice Age&quot;.

==Plot==

In a world of robots, Rodney Copperbottom, son of Herb and Lydia Copperbottom, is an aspiring young inventor from Rivet Town. He idolizes Bigweld, a famous inventor and philanthropist whose company, Bigweld Industries, employs other inventors and provides robots with spare parts. Rodney develops a small, flying robot named Wonderbot to assist his father, who works as a dishwasher in a restaurant. When Herb&#x27;s boss, Mr. Gunk confronts them, however, Wonderbot malfunctions and wreaks havoc in the kitchen.

To help Herb pay for the damages, Rodney travels to Robot City, hoping to present Wonderbot to Bigweld Industries. However, upon his arrival, Rodney is ejected from Bigweld Industries by its new CEO, Phineas T. Ratchet. In Bigweld&#x27;s absence, Ratchet has discontinued production of spare parts and inventions, prioritizing expensive &quot;upgrades&quot;. Meanwhile, Ratchet&#x27;s mother, Madame Gasket, runs the Chop Shop, a facility that recycles scrap metal into ingots for upgrades.

Rodney befriends Fender Pinwheeler, a ne&#x27;er-do-well who introduces him to a group of outmoded robots known as the &quot;Rusties&quot;. Rodney and his new friends help to fix outmodes throughout the neighborhood, but they are eventually unable to cope with the demand due to the spare part shortage. Hoping to enlist Bigweld&#x27;s help, Rodney and Fender infiltrate the Bigweld Ball, but Ratchet announces that Bigweld will not attend. An enraged Rodney confronts Ratchet, who orders his security team to eliminate him. Cappy, an executive opposed to Ratchet, rescues Rodney and Fender. While Fender is captured by the Chop Shop, he discovers their plan to scrap all outmoded robots with new machines designed to take down the outmodes.

Rodney and Cappy fly to Bigweld&#x27;s mansion, where Bigweld lives as a recluse and reveals that Ratchet&#x27;s greed led to his resignation and refuses to help them. A distraught Rodney calls his parents, but Herb inspires him to fight for his dreams. Fender escapes the Chop Shop and exposes Ratchet&#x27;s plot. Rodney rallies the Rusties, and Bigweld, reinvigorated by Rodney&#x27;s spirit, joins them to stop Ratchet. Rodney and his friends return to Bigweld Industries where Ratchet tries disposing of Bigweld, who ends up being rolled into the Chop Shop. Rodney upgrades the Rusties and leads them in a battle against Ratchet, Gasket, and their army. Gasket is eventually flung into an incinerator and killed, and Ratchet is stripped of his upgrades and left chained with his father.

Retaking control of Bigweld Industries, Bigweld holds a public ceremony in Rivet Town, where he nominates Rodney as his new second-in-command and eventual successor. Rodney provides Herb with new replacement parts and a flugelhorn-like instrument to fulfill his life-long dream of being a musician. Herb leads the townspeople in a rousing rendition of &quot;Get Up Offa That Thing&quot;.

==Production==

Initially, Chris Wedge and William Joyce wanted to make a film adaptation of Joyce&#x27;s book &quot;Santa Calls&quot;. After a failed animation test in 2000, Wedge and Joyce decided to instead develop an original story about a world of robots. In 2001, the duo pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox Animation president Chris Meledandri, as a visual idea. Although not initially impressed, Meledandri agreed to greenlight the film and served as the executive producer. The film began production in 2002, shortly after &quot;Ice Age&quot; was released. Wedge reunited with the crew from his first film, including Carlos Saldanha as the co-director. In June 2003, the film was announced by Fox at the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s IMAX theater. This announcement confirmed the entire cast and slated the film for its 2005 release.

==Release==

The film had its world premiere on March 6, 2005, in Westwood, Los Angeles, and it was released theatrically on March 11, 2005. The film was the first to feature the new trailer for &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;; it was reported that &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans went to see the movie just to see the trailer and hear the voice of Ewan McGregor, who also played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy, as Rodney Copperbottom. The film also featured the exclusive trailer for Blue Sky&#x27;s next film &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot;, then called &quot;Ice Age 2&quot;. &quot;Robots&quot; was digitally re-mastered into IMAX format (IMAX DMR) and released in select IMAX theatres around the world. It was the first 20th Century Fox film that was released on the same day on IMAX and conventional 35mm screens. It was also the first IMAX DMR film released in the spring season, and the second IMAX DMR film distributed by Fox.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Robots&quot; delights on a visual level, but the story feels like it came off an assembly line.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, stating that &quot;this is a movie that is a joy to behold entirely apart from what it is about. It looks happy, and, more to the point, it looks harmonious.&quot;

Caroline Westbrook of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film a three stars out of five, and said, &quot;Kids will love it and their adult companions will be warmly entertained—but it&#x27;s far from a computer-animated classic.&quot;

Rob Mackie of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film three stars out of five, saying that it &quot;skillfully combines adult and kids&#x27; comedy. But for all the imaginative splendours and a sharp script, &quot;Robots&quot; is never quite as distinctive as its predecessor, &quot;Ice Age&quot;.&quot;

Common Sense Media gave the film four stars out of five, calling it an &quot;endearing &#x27;follow your dreams&#x27; story with plenty of laughs&quot;.

==&quot;Aunt Fanny&#x27;s Tour of Booty&quot;==
&quot;Aunt Fanny&#x27;s Tour of Booty&quot; is a five-minute computer-animated film that is included as a bonus feature on the DVD and Asian Blu-ray releases of &quot;Robots&quot;, and is a prequel to the film, as it takes place during Fender&#x27;s arrival in Robot City. In the short, Aunt Fanny/Fan gives a tour of the Robot City Train Station to a motley collection of robots, including Fender Pinwheeler, Zinc, Tammy, Hacky and an Old Lady-Bot. It is not included on either the US nor European Blu-ray releases (possibly due to a request from the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) to remove the short from the Australian DVD release, for they gave the short a PG rating).

==Possible sequel==
Following its release, both Wedge and Joyce have expressed interest in doing a sequel.
In light of the Release the Snyder Cut movement and the closure of Blue Sky Studios, a movement to release a director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Robots&quot; has gained traction. A proposed director&#x27;s cut was first mentioned on the film&#x27;s original DVD audio commentary with Wedge and Joyce, in which Wedge said that there would be alternate takes in certain scenes, and that Cappy would have been more fleshed out.

<text>Naval Air Station (NAS) Sigonella is an Italian Air Force base (&#x27;), and a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] installation atItalian Air Force Base Sigonella in Lentini, Sicily, Italy. The whole NAS is a tenant of the Italian Air Force, which has the military and the administrative control. It serves as an Italian base for the 41º Stormo Antisom (41st Antisubmarine Warfare Wing). NAS Sigonella acts also as a landlord to more than 40 other U.S. commands and activities. It is located west and south of the city of Catania, and some south of Mount Etna.

The NAS is located in the western part of the large airport structure, while the Italian military base is located in the eastern part. Because of its location near the center of the Mediterranean Sea, NASSIG is well-placed to support operations by the U.S. 6th Fleet, other U.S. military units, and U.S. allies and coalition partners.

Among the aircraft that fly from this island base are Italian Air Force ATR 72MP (which replaced the Breguet Br.1150 Atlantic in 2017) and United States Air Force C-130, C-17, and C-5 airlifters, KC-135 and KC-10 tankers and U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidons, C-2 Greyhounds, and C-40A Clippers.

It is one of the most frequently used stops for U.S. airlift aircraft bound from the continental United States to Southwest Asia and the Indian Ocean.

NAS Sigonella has the best claim to be a hub of U.S. naval air operations in the Mediterranean. The base command is the landlord to more than 40 other U.S. units. Among the largest are a rotating P-8A patrol squadron; a Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station; and a U.S. Naval Hospital. The hospital was built in 1992. Previously, there was only a clinic and the closest U.S. Naval Hospital was in Naples. Sigonella is home to more than 4,000 troops, civilian personnel, and family members.

NAS Sigonella is the Navy&#x27;s second largest security command, second only to that located at Naval Support Activity Bahrain. NAS Sigonella also has a large support of security personnel from NR NSF Sigonella, a Navy Reserve command based in NRC Detroit at Selfridge ANGB, Michigan.

The Naval Air Station comprises two sections: NAS I was the site of the original U.S. base but is now a support facility, and NAS II which includes the runways, operations, and most tenant commands. NAS I also contains the Navy Exchange and Commissary, the school, and some homes, mainly for the commodore of Task Force 67, the air station commanding officer, the air station executive officer, and commanding officers of tenant activities. NAS I also is host to other facilities, mainly for entertainment. NAS II is now only used as a service base.

Sigonella is based also on the Alliance Ground Surveillance Force (NAGSF) with five RQ-4D Phoenix remotely piloted aircraft and the associated European-sourced ground command and control stations.
==History==
The idea of a U.S. naval airbase on Sigonella arose in the early 1950s, when operations with U.S. Navy P2V Neptunes outgrew their base at Hal Far, Malta. The United States Navy obtained NATO backing for a base on Sicily. Italy made land available under a temporary agreement signed on June 25, 1957. Six days later, Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs) began to deliver equipment from the Malta base.

Ground was broken in September, and construction on the administrative area at NAF I was started in 1958. It was built on top of an airfield where damaged fighters and bombers of the German Air Force had once landed during the World War II. The first Americans arrived for work at Sigonella in March 1959—six months before any buildings were ready—and so worked for six months in Catania at a large warehouse complex called Magazzino Generale (General Warehouse), which is opposite the cemetery on the right side of the street as one enters Catania from the base.

Naval Air Facility, Sigonella, was formally established June 15, 1959, commanded by Captain Walter J. Frazier. By the end of August 1959, the NAF II airfield was available for daylight flights under visual flight rules (VFR); 24 flights were logged by 31 August.

One of Sigonella&#x27;s first buildings was its vector (pest) control center, where rat poison was stored. The Army Corps of Engineers next used the building for their offices, later sharing it with Special Services, or what is now called Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR). Around 1966, the American Forces Network came to Sigonella and joined Special Services, which soon moved out, leaving the building to the broadcasters.

NAF Sigonella&#x27;s first flood occurred in mid-September 1959. The Dittaino Bridge between NAF I and NAF II was under six feet of water on September 20 and all traffic had to go through Catania. Power outages accompanied the floods.

In 1965 the Italian Air Force sited at Sigonella the 41st Antisubmarine Warfare Wing (86st Gruppo and 88st Gruppo) with mixed crews from the Air Force and Navy.

In the 1980s, &quot;Naval Air Facility&quot; Sigonella was redesignated as a &quot;Naval Air Station&quot;.

In 1983 the base was named after World War II pilot Captain Cosimo Di Palma (it), who was shot down by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; while on a mission with the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force and was honored with the Gold Medal of Military Valor.
On the night of October 10, 1985, there were tense hours on NAS II when the Italian Carabinieri, Italian Air Force, and the US Army&#x27;s Delta Force came close to firing upon one another after US Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters intercepted an Egyptian Boeing 737 airliner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship, the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot;, which had been commandeered by members of the PLO on 7 October. The hijackers had killed a Jewish American Leon Klinghoffer. The F-14s instructed the Egyptian plane to land at Sigonella where the Americans had planned to take the hijackers into custody. The Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi instead claimed the hijackers were under Italian jurisdiction. The Italian authorities refused to allow the Navy SEALs to board the plane, threatening to open fire on the Americans had they attempted to do so. The ensuing stand-off lasted throughout the night until President Ronald Reagan ordered the Americans to stand down. The hijackers were eventually tried and sentenced by an Italian court.
In late 1985, work crews belonging to NMCB 133 were repairing and installing sidewalks in the housing area at NAS I when they uncovered a small stockpile of Luftwaffe antiaircraft ammunition. The stockpile had belonged to an antiaircraft position that had been buried during raids in the Allied invasion of 1943.

On April 1, 2004, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) opened Defense Depot Sigonella Italy on NAS II to serve as a supply base for the Mediterranean. DLA also provides fuel and property disposal from NAS II.

Sigonella suffered its second major flood mid December 2005. Over 400 service members and families evacuated. In 2006, a newly installed protective berm prevented a nearly second consecutive year of flooding.

When NATO took military intervention in Libya in 2011, NAS Sigonella played an important role in US Operation Odyssey Dawn because of its short distance to the country. As Libya remained unstable in 2013, a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force–Crisis Response unit was formed and an element of this was moved to the base to be within V-22 range of Libya.

In 2019, an investigation by Sigonella&#x27;s Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) office and the local Carabinieri led to the arrest of 18 individuals suspected of stealing over of JP-5 jet fuel. According to the investigators, the criminal operation, which involved the siphoning of jet fuel from a pipeline connecting Augusta Bay with NAS Sigonella, had been ongoing for almost 3 years and caused approximately 800,000 Euros in damages.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, most of the base including recreational facilities, daycare programs, and the school were shut down to slow the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus.

==Facilities==

The Base Operating and Support Services contractor Gemmo is responsible for pest management at the station.

=== Airport ===
The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 10R/28L which measures and 10L/28R measuring .

===Housing===
Most permanent party military personnel and families are housed in &quot;Marinai&quot;, located 2 minutes from NAS II and approximately 10–15 minutes from NAS I. Marinai flooded in December 2005 displacing many families temporarily. Also in Marinai are Boy Scout Troop 53 and Cub Scout Pack 53. Previously, &quot;Mineo&quot; was used as a housing base, but has since been returned to Italian Nationals and is no longer in service. Temporarily deployed unaccompanied military personnel, typically from rotational squadrons deployed from the United States, are housed in bachelor enlisted quarters and bachelor officer quarters located at NAS II.

From 1987 to 2002, there was a base housing development &quot;Villaggio Costanzo&quot; which was located in the village of Santa Maria La Stella, in the comune of Aci Sant&#x27;Antonio, and approximately 60 minutes from NAS I. The closest community to the base is Motta Sant&#x27;Anastasia, where many military personnel and their families live in rented accommodations &quot;on the economy&quot;. Relations between the Americans and the local Italian nationals are cordial, despite some anti-American demonstrations outside the base protesting the Iraq War. Many Italian nationals are employed as civilian workers at the base.

===Educational opportunities===
Family support includes pre-Kindergarten and Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDs) K-12 schooling. In-person college-level courses are delivered by several universities. In particular, the University of Maryland Global Campus – Europe (formerly the European Division) offers a wide range of courses, depending on demand.

<text>Felix Ludwig Julius Dahn (9 February 1834 – 3 January 1912) was a German law professor and nationalist author, poet and historian.

==Biography==
Felix Ludwig Julius Dahn was born in Hamburg as the oldest son of Friedrich (1811–1889) and Constanze Dahn who were notable actors at the city&#x27;s theatre. The family had both German and French roots. Dahn began his studies in law and philosophy in Munich (he had moved there with his parents in 1834), and graduated as Doctor of Laws in Berlin. After his habilitation treatise, Dahn became a lecturer of German Law in Munich in 1857. In 1863 he became senior lecturer/associate professor in Würzburg, received a professorship in Königsberg (in 1872).

Dahn was married to the artist Sophie Fries (1835–1898), with whom he had a son. He tutored baroness Therese von Droste-Hülshoff, a relative of the poet Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, in poetry from 1867 and entered an illicit love affair with her, which he gave a literary treatment in his &quot;Sind Götter?&quot; (1874). He divorced his wife and married Therese, against opposition from both families, in 1873.

Dahn relocated to University of Breslau in 1888, again as a full professor, and was elected rector of the university in 1895. As rector, he enforced a ban on Polish student associations. 
==Works==
Dahn&#x27;s writings were influential in the conception of the European Migration Period (&quot;Völkerwanderung&quot; ) in German historiography of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His multi-volume &quot;Prehistory of the Germanic and Roman Peoples&quot;, a chronology of the Migration Period that first appeared in print in 1883, was so definitive that abbreviated versions were reprinted until the late 1970s.

From the 1860s, Dahn regularly wrote for &quot;Die Gartenlaube&quot;, Germany&#x27;s most popular family magazine. His nationalist historical novels were widely received, and according to Houdsen (1997) were influential in the formation of the &quot;völkisch&quot; ideology that formed the &quot;Germany&#x27;s pre-Hitlerian intellectual background for National Socialism&quot;. 
His 1876 &quot;Ein Kampf um Rom&quot; according to Kipper (2002) contributed to the ethnic essentialism and opposition to ethnic miscegenation of the &quot;völkisch avant-garde&quot;.

Dahn published numerous poems, many with a nationalist bent. His &quot;Mette von Marienburg&quot; portrays bands of &quot;Masures and Poles&quot; hiding in the &quot;Podolian forest&quot;.

Besides his historical and literary production, Dahn also published a large amount of specialist legal literature, on topics such as trade law and international law.

<doc id="893816" wikidata="Q222191" url="?curid=893816" title="Hyracotherium">
<text>Hyracotherium ( ; &quot;hyrax-like beast&quot;) is an extinct genus of very small (about 60 cm in length) perissodactyl ungulates that was found in the London Clay formation. This small, fox-sized animal is (for some scientists) considered to be the earliest known member of Equidae before the type species, &quot;H. leporinum&quot;, was reclassified as a palaeothere, a perissodactyl family related to both horses and brontotheres. The remaining species are now thought to belong to different genera, such as &quot;Eohippus&quot;, which had previously been synonymised with &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Hyracotherium&quot; averaged 78 cm (2.5 feet) in length and weighed about 9 kg (20 pounds). It had a short face with eye sockets in the middle and a short diastema (the space between the front teeth and the cheek teeth). The skull was long, having 44 low-crowned teeth. Although it had low-crowned teeth, the beginnings of the characteristic horse-like ridges on the molars can be seen. &quot;Hyracotherium&quot; is believed to have been a browsing herbivore that ate primarily soft leaves as well as some fruits and nuts and plant shoots.

==Discovery==
The first fossil identified as being of this genus, holotype specimen BMNH M16336, was found in the cliffs of Studd Hill near Herne Bay, Kent, and described by the paleontologist Richard Owen in a paper read to the Geological Society of London on 18 December 1839 as a &quot;small mutilated cranium about the size of that of a hare&quot;. He identified it as belonging to an extinct order of Pachydermata, with teeth resembling those of the &quot;Chaeropotamus&quot; and the general form of the skull &quot;partaking of a character intermediate between that of the hog and the hyrax, though the large size of the eye must have given to the physiognomy of the living animal a resemblance to that of the Rodentia.&quot; Referring to this resemblance to the hyrax, Owen proposed the genus name &quot;Hyracotherium&quot; for this new genus. In his formal description published by the Geological Society in 1841, Owen wrote &quot;Without intending to imply that the present small extinct Pachyderm was more closely allied to the Hyrax than as being a member of the same order, and similar in size, I propose to call the new genus which it unquestionably indicates, &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;, with the specific name &quot;leporinum.&quot;&quot;

In 1876 Othniel C. Marsh published the description of a full skeleton found in New Mexico, which he placed in a new genus &quot;Eohippus&quot;. Its similarities with the fossils described by Owen were pointed out in a 1932 paper by Sir Clive Forster Cooper. The only species, &quot;E. angustidens&quot;, was moved to the genus &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;, which had priority as the name for the genus, with &quot;Eohippus&quot; becoming a junior synonym of that genus. Many other North American equids were subsequently classified as species of &quot;Hyracotherium&quot; as well, but this synonymy has recently been questioned.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The type species, &quot;H. leporinum&quot;, is now regarded as a paleothere, rather than a horse proper. Most other species of &quot;Hyracotherium&quot; are still regarded as equids, but they have been placed in several other genera, such as &quot;Arenahippus&quot;, &quot;Minippus&quot;, &quot;Sifrhippus&quot;, &quot;Xenicohippus&quot;, &quot;Pliolophus&quot;, &quot;Protorohippus&quot; and the resurrected &quot;Eohippus&quot;. At one time, &quot;Xenicohippus&quot; was regarded as an early brontothere. The main stream of horse evolution occurred on the North American continent.

<text>The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (in case citations, N.D. Ill.) is the federal trial court with jurisdiction over the northern counties of Illinois. It is one of the busiest federal trial courts in the United States, with famous cases including those of Al Capone and the Chicago Eight.

Appeals from the Northern District of Illinois are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). 

The acting United States attorney for the district, representing the United States in litigation in the court, is Morris Pasqual since March 12, 2023.

== Organization ==
The court&#x27;s jurisdiction is split into an eastern division, including Cook, DuPage, McHenry, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle, Lake, and Will counties, with its sessions held in Chicago and Wheaton; and a western division, including Boone, Carroll, DeKalb, Jo Daviess, Lee, Ogle, Stephenson, Whiteside, and Winnebago counties, with its sessions held in Freeport and Rockford.

== History ==
 The United States District Court for the District of Illinois was established by a statute passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1819, . The act established a single office for a judge to preside over the court. Initially, the court was not within any existing judicial circuit, and appeals from the court were taken directly to the United States Supreme Court. In 1837, Congress created the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, placing it in Chicago, Illinois and giving it jurisdiction over the District of Illinois, .

The Northern District itself was created by a statute passed on February 13, 1855, , which subdivided the District of Illinois into the Northern and the Southern Districts. The boundaries of the District and the seats of the courts were set forth in the statute: 

The district has since been re-organized several times. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois was created on March 3, 1905, by , by splitting counties out of the Northern and Southern Districts. It was later eliminated in a reorganization on October 2, 1978, which replaced it with a Central District, , formed primarily from parts of the Southern District, and returning some counties to the Northern District.

The Northern District of Illinois, which contains the entire Chicago metropolitan area, accounts for 1,531 of the 1,828 public corruption convictions in the state between 1976 and 2012, almost 84%, also making it the federal district with the most public corruption convictions in the nation between 1976 and 2012.

<doc id="893821" wikidata="Q1462545" url="?curid=893821" title="Western Somali Liberation Front">
<text>The Western Somali Liberation Front (; abbreviated WSLF) was a Somali movement fighting in eastern Ethiopia to liberate the Somali inhabited Ogaden region from Ethiopian control. It played a major role in the Ogaden War of 1977–78, assisting the invading Somali Army.

== Background ==
After World War II, Somali leaders in the Ogaden (today the Somali Region) persistently advocated for self-determination from the Ethiopian Empire, yet their pleas were consistently disregarded by both imperial authorities and the United Nations. In the post-war period, the British handed over the Ogaden to Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s government. Parts of the region had been nominally under the rule of the Ethiopian Empire since Menelik&#x27;s expansions in the late 1880s. Additionally, the British also handed over lands east of the city of Jigjiga which had never been administered by the Ethiopian Empire.

=== 1960s uprising ===

During the late 1940s and 1950s, covert Somali organizations in the Ogaden formed with the aim of freeing the region from Ethiopian rule. In 1963, the first major rebellion in the region broke out. Known as &#x27;Nasrallah&#x27; or the Ogaden Liberation Front, the organization began with 300 men and soon swelled to 3,000. The Ethiopian Imperial Army launched a large scale counterinsurgency campaign during the summer and fall of 1963. The imperial governments reprisals during the counterinsurgency campaign, which consisted large scale artillery bombardments of Somali cities in the Ogaden, resulted in rapidly deteriorating relations between the Ethiopian Empire and the Somali Republic, eventually resulting the 1964 Border War. In the years following, insurgent activity continued but declined over the late 1960s due to pressures from both the Ethiopian and Somali governments. The Nasrallah insurgents formed the foundation of the future Western Somali Liberation Front. Emperor Selassie enlisted the help of the United States and Israel to suppress Somalis fighting for the Ogaden regions independence.

Between 1965 and 1975, Nasrallah began emphasizing on building the political and diplomatic groundwork for another liberation struggle. The organization opened an office in Mogadishu and in sympathetic Arab states such as Iraq and Syria. Somali insurgents remained active in the Ogaden hinterlands until the rebels under the banner of the Western Somali Liberation Front began operations in 1974.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
In 1969 a new liberation organization began forming. The early 1970s saw the Ogaden liberation movement continue to gain momentum off the foundations of Nasrallah, though the original organization had gradually started to disintegrate. In light of this, veteran insurgents and young intelligentsia from the Ogaden region within Siad Barre&#x27;s government lobbied for Somalia to support the resumption of the armed struggle. Following the toppling of Halie Selassie&#x27;s imperial regime by the Derg military junta, the situation in the Ogaden deteriorated. In the same period, a severe drought gripped the Ogaden resulting in mass suffering. The Derg opted to suppress news of the situation in the region rather than provide relief, and under the junta military oppression in the region increased. As 1974 and 1975 drew on, pressure from Ogaden Somalis rapidly built on the government of Siad Barre. By 1975, the Somali government had been convinced to aid the movement. Significant reorganizations were made in this period, including the decision to choose a new name. There was a sharp debate over whether to name the organization the &#x27;Ogaden&#x27; or &#x27;Western Somali&#x27; liberation front, with the latter eventually prevailing as the choice. The Ethiopian government claimed the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was training the Somali guerrillas.

In January 1976, a general conference of Western Somali society was held 100 km north-west of Mogadishu. A twenty-five member committee was elected to lead the WSLF, and Abdullahi Hassan Mahmoud became its first leader when the organization was formerly founded at the conference. That same year, training camps were soon formed across the Ogaden and Somalia. WSLF launched the Western Somali Youth Organization which became the adolescent faction of the WSLF. The youth divisions president was Mohamoud Dirir Gheddi. WSLF&#x27;s youth organization would build academies for minors in the region.

Despite the organizations clear emphasis on Somalis, the WSLF found support among Muslim Harari and Oromo populations. Many Hararis joined the organization, with several such as Colonel Ezedin Yusuf in leading positions during the armed struggle. According to WSLF accounts, a large number of the fronts younger guerrillas were Harari &quot;boys and girls&quot;, which was named the Imam Ahmed squad after the sixteenth century Muslim leader Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi. Ioan Lewis noted that Muslim Oromo support was significant to the WSLF, and extended into the command structure of the organization.

=== Initiation of WSLF insurgency (1974–1976) ===
During the last years of the Emperor Haile Sellassie&#x27;s rule the WSLF started becoming active in the south. The WSLF found its opportunity when the Derg overthrew Haile Selassie in 1974, and switched from American support to the Soviet Union. The initiation of full scale guerrilla warfare occurred almost simultaneously in the northern and southern regions in the early months of 1976. By the year&#x27;s end, it had expanded across southeastern Bale and Sidamo. The terrain, comprising partly arid scrubland and mountainous and wooded areas, was familiar to the fighters, and the local inhabitants were considered friendly. Infiltrating from various points in the Somali republic, the guerrillas moved rapidly across the rugged hills. Wherever they went, they dismantled the state presence by destroying government offices and systematically targeting police and civilian administration. In total there were fourth Brigades or in Somali &quot;Afar Gaas&quot; within the WSLF movement. At the start of 1977, the WSLF began escalating it attacks against Ethiopian troops. First Brigade was known as &quot;Duufaan&quot;. Second Brigade was known as &quot;Ahmed Gurey&quot; and was the largest Brigade of the WSLF. Third Brigade was known as &quot;Horyaal&quot; and the Fourth Brigade was known as &quot;Ciil Tire&quot;. Each brigade was assigned to enter different front in the Somali Region of Ethiopia.

In 1976, the Somali government set up a counterpart of WSLF to fight in the Oromo areas, calling it the Somali Abo Liberation Front (SALF), whose sphere of operations was in the provinces of Bale, Sidamo, and Arsi, where it advocated union with Somalia or the creation of an independent state. Wako Gutu and Shekih Hussein were some of the prominent Oromo nationalists who joined SALF, which soon surpassed the Oromo Liberation Army (OLF). Somalia equipped both groups with Soviet arms, and in early 1977 sent 3,000 soldiers from the Somali Army to fight as guerrillas with the WSLF.

=== Escalation (1976–1977) ===
During early 1977, with the exception of towns strategically positioned on vital routes and intersections, the WSLF effectively controlled most of the Ogaden lowlands. The rebels employed hit-and-run tactics, targeting the Ethiopian army at its vulnerable points and then blending into a predominantly supportive or sympathetic local population. These tactics eroded the morale of the Ethiopian troops, compelling them to retreat to bunkers and camps. The Ethiopian army found itself confined to garrison towns, many of which were besieged. While any attempt to storm these garrison towns invited devastating firepower from the Ethiopian defenders, travel between towns became perilous. Military and civilian vehicles required armed escorts, often falling into ambushes or encountering land mines. On February 11, 1977, a notable ambush occurred near Horakelifo (between Degehabur and Jijiga), resulting in the death of 25 soldiers and officers, with another 24 wounded, and the destruction of armored cars and trucks. Around the same time, a police contingent was annihilated not far from Filtu. These disruptions to supply lines led to frequent transportation delays to the camps. In addition to affecting the morale of the troops, guerrilla actions aimed at sabotaging the economy also occurred. In the summer of 1977, WSLF fighters destroyed several important installations, and on June 1, they detonated the railway connecting the Ethiopian capital to the port of Djibouti. This crucial economic lifeline, normally handling 70 percent of Ethiopia&#x27;s exports and 50 percent of her imports, remained out of commission until August.

Initially composed of an active force of roughly 5,000 guerrillas, the WSLF was not able to seize control of any major towns or important outposts controlled by the Ethiopian military during early stages of the insurgency.

June 1977 saw the WSLF step up its campaign. The three major towns of the Ogaden: Jigjiga, Dire Dawa and Harar all came under repeated insurgent attack. Transportation routes between the towns were constantly harassed and vital bridges were destroyed. In order to protect the Djibouti-Addis railway the Derg deployed thousands of paratroopers on the vital rail lines connecting Ethiopia to the sea. Despite this effort the WSLF successfully cut the rail line. That month, the WSLF had been successful in forcing the Ethiopian army out of much of the Ogaden and into the strongholds of Harar, Dire Dawa and Jigjiga. Siad Barre decided to intensify the war by involving the Somali army as he believed it would allow the WSLF to press home their growing victories and enable the complete secession of the Ogaden. On June 13, 1977, approximately 5,000 SNA soldiers crossed the border, launching a coordinated attack on specific targets in the Ogaden. The soldiers had taken off their uniform insignia and disguised themselves as guerrillas for the operation. Under the command of SNA officers, the WSLF engaged in attacks on Ethiopian military positions, pounding Gode, Degehabur and Kebri Dahar with mortars and rockets. However, the offensive was repulsed with heavy casualties. At Gode alone, 300 WSLF guerrillas and 14 high ranking SNA officers were killed. Dissent among the army, especially among the Ogaden clan, became vocal. After this disastrous offensive, the decision was made to invade Ethiopia to support the WSLF.

=== Ogaden War (1977–1978) ===

On July 13, 1977, the Somali National Army (SNA) invaded Ethiopia to assist the WSLF. The Somali government refused to declare war, instead insisting that in the media that all the military actions were taken by the WSLF. The WSLF engaged in sabotage actions, impairing the mobility of the Ethiopian army. By September 1977, the SNA/WSLF had overrun 90% of the Ogaden. Bolstered by the arrival of the SNA, which was primarily composed of armored and motorized units, the WSLF went on to capture Jigjiga in September 1977. The 2nd Brigade, Ahmed Gurey was the main strength of the WSLF during the war, they captured Jigjiga after 4 weeks of heavy fighting with the Ethiopia army. Former Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed said &quot;the WSLF brigades were very strong and united against all odds&quot; during his interview with former BBC World Service report Abdisalan Harari. This was claim backed by an interview with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. By the November and the onset of the rainy season, the WSLF was poised to capture the city of Harar. However, in early 1978 the Ethiopian government acquired a new arsenal of Soviet equipment and, spearheaded by Cuban combat troops, managed to push back the SNA/WSLF forces.

According to British journalist and military historian Mark Urban, &quot;Under the leadership of Hassan Mahmoud, the WSLF had waged a spectacular campaign, but unlike the Eritreans, they failed to grasp the importance of publicizing their struggle abroad.&quot; Urban observes that had the WSLF pursued this more seriously, it may have been able to acquire some of the vital weaponry required to defend themselves from airstrikes.

After the Ogaden War, the Ethiopian army only remained in full control of the Ogaden for a very brief period of time. During a conference on 11 March 1978, WSLF head Abdullahi Mahmoud Hassan declared that despite the withdrawal of the Somali army forces deployed to support it, the front would continue its liberation struggle.

=== Post Ogaden War and decline ===
During June 1978, the WSLF had a major success when it reclaimed the town of Gode, killing 300 Ethiopian and Cuban troops while disabling the only viable air base in the area. During the summer of 1978, the WSLF was back in control of most of the Ogaden countryside, and the Ethiopian army was confined to the towns and the roads. Sweeps and patrols in 1979 managed to reduce rebel activity, but failed to clear out the insurgents. By the end of the 70s, the WSLF was estimated to have an army of 18,000 men, thus becoming the second largest rebel group in Ethiopia, the first being the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF). As the WSLF faced large scale Ethiopian and Cuban army assaults following the war, they were left with only small arms and mortars to combat helicopter gunships and armored vehicles operating in open terrain. The Ethiopian government initiated a policy of depopulating and resettling Somalis to weaken the WSLF&#x27;s social base. Simultaneously, they introduced thousands of Amhara, Tigrayan, and Oromo settlers to strengthen Ethiopian control over the region. The Ethiopians began using the newly formed Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) to help hunt down WSLF fighters.

In the years following the 1977-1978 Ogaden War, many supporters of the WSLF became disillusioned with the organizations increasing reliance on Mogadishu and were frustrated by international portrayals of the struggle in the Ogaden as merely a border matter between Ethiopia and Somalia. A few of WSLF&#x27;s recruits for its youth faction would go on to form the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) in 1984. During 1979, the Isaaq wing of the WSLF, Afraad, came into conflict with the main Ogaden clan forces of the WSLF following an incident where a WSLF fighter had committed rape which had then escalated into murder and further violence.

==== 1980s ====
In the early 1980s, the Ethiopian government transformed the Ogaden into a vast military zone, carrying out indiscriminate aerial bombardments and forced resettlement programs. Foreign correspondents visiting the region during this time observed a stark &#x27;dual society,&#x27; with Somali inhabitants identifying strongly as &#x27;Western Somalis.&#x27; The Derg regime also engineered artificial droughts and famines to weaken Somali resistance to Ethiopian rule in the Ogaden.

In August 1980, the Derg regime launched a massive anti-insurgency campaign known as &quot;Operation Lash&quot; to clear the Ogaden of insurgents. The Ethiopian army deployed six divisions consisting of 60,000 men under the command of Merid Negussie. After stationing troops around the border of Somalia to block suspected entry and exit points, the Ethiopian forces moved in, dispersing, encircling and liquidating the rebels. The SALF disintegrated, whereas the WSLF managed to escape to northern Somalia. Ethiopian historian Gebru Tareke claims that by December 1980, the Ogaden was reportedly cleared from insurgents. During these operations the Ethiopians used the SSDF rebels to attack WSLF camps within Somalia.

In 1981, fighting with the WSLF continued. In the environs of Harar and Jigjiga the WSLF engaged in fierce battles with the Ethiopian army. Fighting also took place around Kebri Dahar and WSLF claimed that it had severed the major roads linking towns. That same year, the Mengistu regime began to support the Somali National Movement (SNM). The resulting war between the SNM and the WSLF was an important element in Ethiopian strategy, to exploit the clan divisions within Somali society and give the WSLF the final blow. From 1982 to 1984, the Somali National Movement (SNM) with support from the Ethiopian army, engaged in intense clashes with the WSLF in north western Somalia. In December 1984 the SNM launched an offensive that forced the WSLF out of its rear bases in northern Somalia. By January 1985, the WSLF had effectively ceased to exist.

<text>The Score is the second and latest studio album by the hip hop trio Fugees, released worldwide on February 13, 1996, on Columbia Records. The album features a wide range of samples and instrumentation, with many aspects of alternative hip-hop that would come to dominate the hip-hop music scene in the mid- to late-1990s. Primarily, &quot;The Score&quot;″s production was handled by the Fugees themselves, Jerry Duplessis and Warren Riker, with additional production from Salaam Remi, John Forté, Diamond D, and Shawn King. The album&#x27;s guest verses are from Outsidaz members Rah Digga, Young Zee, and Pacewon, as well as John Forté, and Diamond D. Most versions of the album feature four bonus tracks, including three remixes of &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot;, and a short acoustic Wyclef Jean solo track entitled &quot;Mista Mista&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;The Score&quot; was a commercial success, peaking atop the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also topped the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart for eight weeks, becoming the longest running number one for a hip hop group, and topped the 1996 year-end chart. The singles &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot;, and &quot;Ready or Not&quot; also achieved notable chart success, leading the album to become the third best selling album of 1996 in the United States, and helping the group achieve worldwide recognition.

The album received critical acclaim. It received a nomination for Album of the Year at the 39th Grammy Awards, becoming the second rap album to receive a nomination in the category and the first from a hip hop group; and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, along with Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;. In retrospect, &quot;The Score&quot; has garnered a considerable amount of acclaim over the years, with many music critics and publications noting it as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. &quot;The Score&quot; was included on the list of 200 Definitive Albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was ranked number 134 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s revised list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; (2020).

As of February 2021, &quot;The Score&quot; has been certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is the best-selling album by an American hip hop act in France, where the album has been certified Diamond. With an estimated 22 million copies sold worldwide, the album has become one of the best-selling albums of all time, at the time of its release it briefly became the best-selling hip hop album of all time, and remains the best-selling album by a hip hop group. As of June 2021, the album is the fifth-most streamed 1990s hip-hop album on Spotify.

== Background ==
Although the Fugees&#x27; previous album, &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot; proved to be critically and commercially unsuccessful, Chris Schwartz, the head of Ruffhouse Records, decided to give the group another chance. In early 1995, he gave them a $135,000 advance and granted them complete artistic control for a follow-up album. The group used the money for recording equipment and set up a studio in Wyclef Jean&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s basement, which they referred to as the Booga Basement.

Recording for the album began in June 1995, and extended into November 1995 at what Jean described as a &quot;relaxed pace ... It was done calmly, almost unconsciously. There wasn&#x27;t any pressure–it was like &#x27;let&#x27;s make some music&#x27;, and it just started forming into something amazing. It sounded like a feel-good hip hop record to us, and it was different than what anyone was doing at the time. It was three kids from an urban background expressing themselves.&quot;

In regard to &quot;The Score&quot;″s unified themes and production, Lauryn Hill commented: &quot;It&#x27;s an audio film. It&#x27;s like how radio was back in the 1940s. It tells a story, and there are cuts and breaks in the music. It&#x27;s almost like a hip hop version of &quot;Tommy&quot;, like what The Who did for rock music.&quot;

== Music ==
&quot;The Score&quot; was produced by a variety of producers including each member of the Fugees, as well as Diamond D, Salaam Remi, and Jerry Duplessis. Although most tracks are built on sampled melodies, live instrumentation and DJing are incorporated into multiple tracks. Wyclef Jean plays the guitar on &quot;Family Business&quot;, while DJ Skribble scratches on &quot;Manifest/Outro&quot;. Nevertheless, samples are the predominant production tool on &quot;The Score&quot;. &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot; incorporates a sample of Teena Marie&#x27;s &quot;Ooo La La La&quot;, and is interpolated in the song&#x27;s chorus. &quot;Ready or Not&quot; also contains a sample that is interpolated; &quot;Ready or Not (Here I Come)&quot; by the Delfonics. &quot;Manifest/Outro&quot; contains a sample from &quot;Rock Dis Funky Joint&quot; by Poor Righteous Teachers, while the title track, &quot;The Score&quot; contains vocal samples from every track on the entire album.

Three official singles were released in promotion of &quot;The Score&quot;, the first of which was &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot;, which was released on January 9, 1996, reached the Top 40, peaking at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Additionally, the song reached No. 13 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, and No. 2 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot; was produced by Salaam Remi and includes elements of &quot;Ooo La La La&quot; as performed by Teena Marie.

The second single, &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, with lead vocals by Lauryn Hill, was released on May 31, 1996. &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; proved to be the most successful single from the album. The song went No. 1 in 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it peaked atop the UK Singles Chart, and became one of the region&#x27;s best-selling singles ever. In the US, the song wasn’t available for purchase, which made it ineligible to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart due to their previous rules; however, it still managed to peak at No. 1 on the US Mainstream Top 40 and Rhythmic airplay charts. Initially, the song was to be titled &quot;Killing Them Softly&quot;, and though alluding to Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel&#x27;s &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;, it was originally not intended to be a cover; however, the original writers refused permission for the rewrite of their song, but did allow the Fugees to do a cover version. In 1997, &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; won the Fugees a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by Duo or group.

The third single released from the album was &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, which was released on September 2, 1996. In the US the song peaked at No. 34 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. The song became their second No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, staying at the top for two weeks. The track interpolates &quot;Ready or Not, Here I Come (Can&#x27;t Hide from Love)&quot; as performed by the Delfonics, and also samples Enya&#x27;s &quot;Boadicea&quot;. Initially, this sample was uncredited, and Enya was prepared to sue for copyright infringement, but decided not to when she discovered that the Fugees were not gangsta rappers.

The accompanying music video was directed by film director Marcus Nispel, and was reported to have cost approximately 1.3 million dollars at the time, making it one of the most expensive music videos ever. In a later interview, Fugees member Pras described the recording of &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, stating, &quot;The three of us was each going through some pain. Lauryn was crying when she did her vocals. It was unbelievable. To see her singing with tears coming out of her eyes, it made me want to cry too.&quot;

The fourth and final single from the album, a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, with lead vocals by Wyclef Jean, was released on November 18, 1996. It was produced by Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill, with additionally production from Pras and Jerry &#x27;Wonder&#x27; Duplessis. It features uncredited backing vocals from by Marley&#x27;s children Stephen and Sharon Marley, as well as reggae singer Pam Hall. An official remix of the track, featuring Stephen Marley, was included on the group&#x27;s third release, &quot;Bootleg Versions&quot;. The song peaked at No. 38 on the US Hot 100 Airplay chart. It was more successful worldwide, peaking atop the New Zealand Singles Chart for two weeks, and No. 2 in the UK.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;The Score&quot; received critical acclaim. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer James Bernard commented, &quot;What a shock: a smooth, well-produced rap album that doesn&#x27;t have Dr. Dre&#x27;s fingerprints on it [...] &quot;The Score&quot; showcases their acrobatic lyrical techniques and restless intelligence, and unlike much East Coast rap, &quot;The Score&quot; feels warm and intimate — partly because the instruments are live but also because the Fugees sound so relaxed and casual.&quot; Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called &quot;The Score&quot; &quot;so beautiful and funny its courage could make you weep&quot;, and said the Fugees possess &quot;black humanism&quot; and &quot;the gender-equality formula in which one girl learning equals two guys calling the shots&quot;. Steve Huey from AllMusic wrote that, &quot;Even when they&#x27;re not relying on easily recognizable tunes, their original material is powered by a raft of indelible hooks [...] &quot;The Score&quot; balances intelligence and accessibility with an easy assurance, and ranks as one of the most distinctive hip hop albums of its era.&quot; Cheo Hodari Coker from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that, &quot;&quot;The Score&quot; succeeds on all counts&quot;, while the Fugees are as fluid a rap group since A Tribe Called Quest: &quot;Their specialty is matching a gymnastic rhyme flow and rock-solid beats with expert crooning.&quot; Selwyn Seyfu Hinds of &quot;Spin&quot; commented, &quot;A sense of organic interaction is the hallmark of this album [...] the album&#x27;s most important factor is its beats; chest-shaking, obscure-texture-having, freestyle-friendly beats.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; described the album as &quot;An impressively panoramic soundscape.&quot;

However, in a mixed review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Ann Powers commented, &quot;The Fugees&#x27; roots in reggae gives them a solid base in song and a basic philosophy that&#x27;s richer than the money-or-nothing ethic that dulls much of rap these days. Without being sanctimonious, &quot;The Score&quot; paints the ghetto as a mythical landscape, one that can inspire pride as well as sorrow. Like Wu-Tang Clan, the Fugees view the world as their movie, complete with stunts and special effects.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the group&#x27;s &quot;vision of ghetto life&quot; both eccentric and realistic, although he felt &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; sounds &quot;out of place amid the hard-nosed surrealism&quot;.

<text>Gabriel Stefan Kapler (born July 31, 1975), nicknamed &quot;Kap&quot;, is an American assistant general manager of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is also a former professional baseball outfielder and manager in MLB.

Kapler was a 57th-round draft pick (1,487th overall) by the Detroit Tigers in the 1995 MLB draft. In the minor leagues, he was an All-Star in 1996, 1997, and 1998, and was recognized by national publications as Minor League Player of the Year in 1998.

He played in the major leagues from 1998 to 2010, for the Tigers, Texas Rangers, Colorado Rockies, Boston Red Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, and Tampa Bay Rays (except for the 2007 season, which — having briefly retired as a player — he spent managing the Greenville Drive of the South Atlantic League, the Single-A affiliate of the Red Sox). Kapler also spent part of the 2005 season playing for the Yomiuri Giants in Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League.

After permanently retiring as a player, Kapler served as a coach for the Israeli national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, and as Director of Player Development for the Dodgers from 2014 through 2017. He was the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies in 2018 and 2019. He became the manager of the San Francisco Giants in 2020, and led them to a franchise-record 107 wins and the NL West title in 2021. Kapler was named the 2021 National League Manager of the Year. ESPN described him as &quot;an analytically savvy, outside-the-box thinker who [can] also relate well to players.&quot; The Giants fired Kapler towards the end of the 2023 season. In December 2023, Kapler became an assistant general manager of the Miami Marlins of MLB.

==Early life==
Kapler was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, and is Jewish. His father, Michael, was a classical pianist originally from Brooklyn, New York who also wrote music and taught piano. His mother, Judy, is an early childhood educator at a Jewish preschool who is originally from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. They met while working in the antiwar movement of the 1960s and moved to California in the 1970s. Kapler and his brother Jeremy attended The Country School, due to their father&#x27;s position on the faculty as a music teacher.

At the age of eight, he was hit by a car and needed therapy to overcome his fear of crossing streets. He grew up in middle-class Reseda, Los Angeles, in the San Fernando Valley, where he was the smallest player on his Reseda Little League team.

Kapler attended William Howard Taft Charter High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. He played shortstop, second base, and third base for its baseball team, hitting .313 in his senior season, and graduated in 1993 at age 17. In his four seasons of high school baseball, he never hit a home run. During the summer, he batted .350 with 4 home runs and 30 runs batted in (RBIs) for the Woodland Hills East American Legion team.

==College career==
Kapler attended Cal State-Fullerton in fall 1993 on scholarship for one semester, before transferring to Moorpark College in the fall of 1994. He was named First Team All-Western State Conference after batting .337 with seven home runs and 52 RBIs. He was inducted into the Moorpark College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Kapler was the 57th-round draft pick (1,487th overall) of the Detroit Tigers in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft. He was signed by scout Dennis Lieberthal, father of former Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal, after being offered a $10,000 signing bonus. Playing 63 games for the Jamestown Jammers after he signed, he tied for second in the Class A- New York–Penn League in doubles (with 19), fifth in extra-base hits (27), and batted .288/.351/.453.

In 1996, with the Fayetteville Generals, Kapler led the Class A South Atlantic League in hits (157), doubles (45; 2nd in the minor leagues), extra-base hits (71) and total bases (280), was second in homers (26), RBIs (99) and slugging (.534), 5th in batting (.300), 7th in runs (81) and 10th in on-base percentage (.380). He made the South Atlantic League All-Star team. He then played for the West Oahu CaneFires in the Hawaiian Winter League, leading the league in home runs with 7.

In 1997, with the Lakeland Flying Tigers, Kapler led the Class A+ Florida State League in doubles (40) and total bases (262), tied for first in extra-base hits (65), was 2nd in games, 3rd in hits (153), tied for 3rd in home runs (19) and RBIs (87), 4th in slugging percentage (.505), and tied for 4th in runs (87) and sacrifice flies (10), while batting .295. He was named a Florida State League mid-season and post-season All-Star. He then played for the Honolulu Sharks in the Hawaiian Winter League.

In 1998, with the Jacksonville Suns, Kapler won the Class AA Southern League Most Valuable Player Award. He hit a league-high 28 home runs, and also led the league in hits (176; 8th-most in the minors), runs (113; 6th-most in the minors), doubles (47; 3rd-most in the minor leagues; breaking the old doubles record of 44), RBIs (146; most in the minors in 1998, and most ever in the Southern League), extra-base hits (81; a league record), total bases (319; a league record), and sacrifice flies (11). He was 3rd in the league in slugging percentage (.583), 4th in OPS (.976), 5th in batting average (.322), and tied for 8th in triples (6). His league record for RBIs broke the 1986 record of 132 set by Terry Steinbach. He played in both the Double-A and Southern League All-Star Games, and was recognized as the MVP of the Southern League All-Star Game. He was also named to the Southern League&#x27;s post-season All-Star team, and named a &quot;Baseball America&quot; First Team Minor League All Star. He was honored as Minor League Player of the Year by &quot;Baseball Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;, and was named Tigers Minor League Player of the Year and Detroit&#x27;s No. 1 prospect by &quot;Baseball America&quot;.

===Detroit Tigers (1998–1999)===
Kapler made his Major League debut in 1998 at the age of 22. He became the first Tiger since the inception of the draft in 1969 to be selected as late as the 57th round, and reach the majors.

In 1999, he hit his first career home run on April 30 against Albie Lopez of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Kapler&#x27;s 10 home runs in his first 64 games was the fastest by a Tiger rookie since 1954, and was not surpassed until 2008. For the season, Kapler wound up hitting a career-high 18 home runs in just over 400 at bats, third among AL rookies, and his 49 RBIs were ninth among AL rookies.

===Texas Rangers (2000–2002)===
In November 1999, he was traded by the Tigers with Al Webb, Frank Catalanotto, Francisco Cordero, Bill Haselman, and Justin Thompson to the Texas Rangers for Juan González, Danny Patterson, and Gregg Zaun.

Kapler hit two home runs on Opening Day in the 2000 season for the Rangers, becoming the first player to homer in his first two at bats as a Ranger. In July he homered in four straight games, tying a club record. He then had a team-record 28-game hitting streak later that season, which was also a major league high for the season. On July 30, he was named the American League&#x27;s Player of the Week. In 2000, he batted .302/.360/.473 with 32 doubles (second on the team), 14 home runs, and 66 RBIs in 444 at bats, hitting .344 in the second half of the season. On defense, playing primarily center field, he tied for second among AL outfielders with 4 double plays.

In 2001, he hit 17 home runs, scored 77 runs, had 72 RBIs, and stole 23 bases (leading the team) in 29 attempts. Kapler batted .267/.348/.437. He made just one error in 344 total chances for a .997 fielding percentage, second-best in the AL, and his eight assists tied for fourth-most of any AL center fielder.

===Colorado Rockies (2002–2003)===
In July 2002, the Rangers traded Kapler, with Jason Romano and cash, to the Colorado Rockies for Dennys Reyes and Todd Hollandsworth. Playing for the Rockies in 2002, he batted .311/.359/.445 in 119 at bats. In 2002 between Texas and Colorado, he batted .279, and .357 with runners in scoring position, as on defense he had 10 outfield assists.

===Boston Red Sox (2003–2004)===

On June 28, 2003, the Boston Red Sox acquired Kapler from the Rockies. He batted .292/.349/.449 for the Red Sox, in 158 at bats.

In 2004, when Shawn Green of the Dodgers announced that he would not play on Yom Kippur, the Boston media asked Kapler if he would do the same thing. Kapler called a Boston-area rabbi for advice. With the Curse of the Bambino still hanging over Red Sox fans&#x27; heads, the rabbi reportedly said: &quot;Do it! We need all the help we can get!&quot; Kapler decided to play.

Kapler played a career-high 136 games in 2004, hitting 6 home runs and driving in 33 runs in 290 at bats, as he primarily played right field. He batted .272. He also led the team with 6 outfield assists. On Patriots&#x27; Day 2004, Kapler drove in two runs, including the game-winner in the bottom of the eighth inning off former Red Sox closer and Yankees setup man Tom Gordon. The Red Sox went on to win the game 5–4.

In Game 4 of the 2004 World Series against the Cardinals, Kapler had been inserted as a pinch runner, but manager Terry Francona left him in the game to play right field in the ninth. Kapler joined an exclusive club, as one of the nine players who were on the field when the Red Sox won their first title in 86 years.

===Yomiuri Giants (2005)===
Less than one month after the Red Sox dramatic 2004 World Series victory, Kapler departed to play for Japan&#x27;s Yomiuri Giants. He received a $2 million deal plus a $700,000 signing bonus, compared to the $750,000 salary he had received from the Red Sox. Driven by the memory of an elementary-school report that he had written about Japan, he felt it was time for a change. &quot;I tend to make emotional decisions,&quot; he said. &quot;I did it more for the life experience than anything else. And ever since I wrote that report, I&#x27;ve been fascinated by everything that an 8-year-old associates with a country far, far away.&quot; He struggled in 38 games in Japan, and was placed on the inactive list by Yomiuri in the 2005 mid-season.

===Boston Red Sox (2005–2006)===
Kapler was re-signed by the Red Sox in July 2005, just a few hours after clearing Japanese Central League waivers. In September 2005, Kapler ruptured his left Achilles tendon while rounding the bases after a home run by teammate Tony Graffanino. He had surgery, which ended his season.

In June 2006, Kapler came back from his injury. That season, he had his best on-base percentage in five years (.340), hit .316 with two out and runners in scoring position, and played error-less outfield for the second year in a row.

Kapler announced his retirement from professional baseball on December 12, 2006.

===Minor league managerial career (2007)===
He served the Boston Red Sox as manager of their Single-A affiliate, the Greenville Drive, for one season in 2007. The team went 58–81, and finished in 7th place in the South Atlantic League Southern Division.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2008)===
On September 20, 2007, after one season as a manager, Kapler announced that he would like to return to play Major League Baseball in 2008. On the decision, Kapler said &quot;I miss the battle. I still need to be on the field as a player.&quot; On December 20, Kapler signed a one-year, non-guaranteed contract with the Milwaukee Brewers that paid $800,000 when Kapler made the roster.
The initial plan, before Mike Cameron was acquired, was to have Kapler replace the non-tendered Kevin Mench as a right-handed option to share time with Tony Gwynn Jr., Gabe Gross, and Joe Dillon, in left field. With a focus on defense, Yost indicated in March that Gwynn and Kapler might have a leg up on Gross.

&quot;He&#x27;s been very impressive so far,&quot; said Brewers manager Ned Yost in March. &quot;I would have never known he took a year off. He does not show any signs of it to me.

While Cameron served a 25-game suspension to start the season for twice testing positive for a banned stimulant in the fall of 2007, Kapler made the club, and began to see action in center field. On April 5, 2008, he hit the first pinch-hit home run of his career for Milwaukee in the 7th inning of a game against the San Francisco Giants. Kapler started the season as the Brewers&#x27; hottest hitter, going 11-for-26 with four home runs and 11 RBIs.

Kapler gave fans a taste of his hard-nosed style against the Dodgers on August 16. He ran full-speed after Russell Martin&#x27;s long fly in the seventh inning, snagging the ball to deprive Martin of a home run as he toppled head-first into the left-field seats. The outstanding catch helped the Brewers hold onto a one-run lead, and earned Kapler the Play of the Year Award, voted by over 12 million fans in MLB&#x27;s This Year in Baseball Awards. Similarly, three days later Kapler made a diving catch in left field to rob Ty Wigginton of a hit, and on September 6 Kapler ran down a blooper to center and made an outstanding diving catch. Kapler missed the last two weeks of the season as well as the NLDS after tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle in his right shoulder on a throw to the plate in mid-September.

For the year, in 96 games Kapler batted .301/.340/.498, and hit eight home runs, playing mostly in center field, and batting .386 with a .632 slugging percentage in tie games. Kapler started 43 games. He was the club&#x27;s best pinch-hitter, batting .323 with two homers (the first pinch-hit shots of his career) and 8 RBIs.

On October 30, 2008, Kapler filed for free agency.

===Tampa Bay Rays (2009–2010)===
On January 12, 2009, Kapler signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays for $1,000,018. The extra $18 was chosen because it represented the symbol for &quot;life&quot; in Judaism.

Kapler started the season platooning in center field with Matt Joyce, in place of Rays&#x27; center fielder B. J. Upton, who had offseason surgery on his left shoulder and was not ready for Opening Day. On April 13, Kapler struck out against New York Yankee outfielder Nick Swisher. Kapler then began to platoon in right field with Gabe Gross. In June, he tied a club record shared by Jose Canseco and Julio Lugo, with home runs in four straight games. Kapler ended the season at .354 with 4 homers in 82 at-bats against left-handers. In this role, he almost broke up Mark Buehrle&#x27;s perfect game on July 23, 2009. Leading off the ninth inning against the White Sox, he was robbed of a home run by a leaping DeWayne Wise, a ninth inning defensive replacement.

Through July 10, despite a slow start, Kapler had the best slugging percentage of his career (.505) and was batting .320 with 4 home runs in 75 at-bats and a .680 slugging percentage against left-handers. As of July 10, 64% of his hits in 2009 had been for extra bases, which would be first in the major leagues for a player with at least 100 plate appearances (Kapler had 129).

Kapler was re-signed by the Rays on October 27, 2009, to another one-year contract, this time for $1.05 million. Over 2008–09, Kapler hit .304 against left-handers with a .577 slugging percentage, 9th-best in the Major Leagues. &quot;Over the past two years, Kap has been one of the best in baseball against left-handed pitching&quot;, said Rays executive vice president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. &quot;Because he&#x27;s also a plus defensive outfielder, he&#x27;s become a tremendous asset here. His value even extends beyond the field; his knowledge and presence make him a positive influence on our younger players.&quot;

In a December interview manager Joe Maddon said: &quot;I&#x27;m still a big Gabe Kapler fan. You look at his OPS over the last couple of years versus left-handed pitching, it&#x27;s among the best in all of baseball&quot;.

Heading into spring training in 2010, Kapler was likely to platoon in right field with Joyce. However, he appeared in only 59 games that season, hitting a career-worst .210 with only two home runs as he battled right hip flexor and right ankle injuries, and became a free agent after the season.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On January 18, 2011, Kapler signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also received an invitation to spring training. Kapler was released on March 31, in the team&#x27;s last cut of spring training.

==Post-playing career==
===Team Israel===
Kapler coached for the Israeli national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifier in September 2012. Israel lost to Spain in extra innings in the Pool Finals, and did not qualify to play in the World Baseball Classic.

===Egraphs===
From 2012 to 2013, Kapler worked closely with technology startup Egraphs, which focused on electronic personalized autographs, and which was licensed with MLB and the NBA. In spring 2013, Egraphs closed operations.

===Television work===
In the summer of 2013, Kapler became an analyst for Fox Sports 1 cable network. He appeared frequently on the network&#x27;s &quot;Fox Sports Live&quot; program from the network&#x27;s debut on August 17, 2013, as well as &quot;MLB Whiparound&quot; from the program&#x27;s inception in March 2014. Two of his segments were &quot;Saberclips&quot;, in which he explained advanced statistics and sabermetrics used in baseball, and also &quot;In the Cage&quot;, in which he shared advice with young baseball players as to how to train when they hit the batting cage. He also worked as a writer and analyst at Baseball Prospectus, which is devoted to the sabermetric baseball analysis.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On November 7, 2014, Kapler became the Dodgers&#x27; director of player development. In that position, Kapler had all the affiliates in the Dodgers farm system, as well as the major league team, switch to serving entirely organic food, and take junk food out of the clubhouse. Kapler, known as a proponent of advanced statistics and healthy food, explained his flexible general approach, saying: One thing we want to do is avoid locking ourselves into any organizational philosophy that can&#x27;t be easily altered or improved. While mining for best practices, we have overarching themes and philosophies, but we don&#x27;t want to say, &#x27;This is what we believe&#x27; and get so dug in that we&#x27;re not capable of being nimble as new studies present better ways to approach problems and development. That flexibility is a thought process that we have to constantly talk about it with players and staff.

In 2015, a 17-year-old accused a Dodger minor league player initially of videotaping a fight in which two women whom she had met through Facebook hit her while with her in a hotel room of a player. The accuser emailed her complaint to Kapler. He sought direction from Dodgers&#x27; lawyers and human resources personnel and then replied quickly with a phone call, apologized, and offered to help in any way she needed. A week later—when the accuser was arrested for shoplifting—she added the second accusation to police, though she did not communicate it to Dodgers personnel, that at the time a Dodger minor league player engaged in alleged sexual assault by briefly putting his hand under her bra and down her pants; the accuser then declined to cooperate with the police, and no charges were filed. Kapler reported the accusation of the videotaping of the assault to Dodgers personnel, who did not report it to Major League Baseball. Kapler has apologized for his handling of the allegations.

Kapler was one of the favorites and a finalist to become the new Dodgers manager following the departure of Don Mattingly, but lost out to Dave Roberts prior to the 2016 season.

==Managerial career==
===Philadelphia Phillies (2018–2019)===

On October 30, 2017, the Philadelphia Phillies announced that they had hired the 42-year-old Kapler as their new manager, the 54th in team history. Phillies General Manager Matt Klentak and principal owner John Middleton said that what most impressed them during Kapler&#x27;s interview, which included people across several team departments, were his level of preparation and his people skills, evidenced by his ability to connect with each one of the groups.

Kapler inherited a team that had lost 96 games their prior season, the team&#x27;s sixth season in a row with a losing record. He had his theme for the season inscribed on t-shirts that were given out to each of his players: &quot;Be Bold.&quot; After 100 games, he had the second-most wins among Phillies managers historically (56), and he went 24-38 in the last 62 games, to finish the 2018 season 80-82. The 27 overturns caused by his challenges were tied for the second-most in the majors, and the 4.7 pitchers per game he used were second-most in the major leagues. The Phillies were in first place as late as August 12, but only won 21 games in the last two months of the season.

In 2019 he managed the team to an record, Philadelphia&#x27;s best record since 2012 when they also had a .500 record. The 23 overturns caused by his challenges were tied for the second-most in the majors. As in 2018, the Phillies spent most of the season in playoff contention, only to slump in August and September. Following the season, Kapler was fired. Joe Girardi succeeded him and managed the team to a record the following season.

===San Francisco Giants (2020–2023)===
====2020====
In November 2019, the San Francisco Giants hired Kapler as their 39th manager, succeeding the retiring Bruce Bochy. He inherited a team that had a win–loss record of in 2019.

In 2020, after Kapler hired three hitting coaches who were young enough to still be players, the Giants veteran hitters raved about how well prepared they were going into games with the new approach. Kapler platooned whenever he thought he could get an advantage, and the resulting turnaround with the Giants hitters was significant. While the team had ranked 28th, 29th, and 29th in runs the prior three seasons, under Kapler they finished 8th in runs, averaging 4.98 runs per game, up from 4.19 the prior year and 3.72 in 2018. Kapler used 1.25 pinch hitters per game, more than any other manager in major league baseball, and the third-most pitchers per game (4.9). Both new and veteran players responded positively to Kapler, and a number of them highlighted his steadiness as a factor in turning around slumping years. In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he managed the team to a record that far exceeded expectations in what was expected to be a rebuilding year, and surpassed the record of Kapler&#x27;s former team, the Phillies. The Giants fell just short of making the playoffs, which they would have made had they won their last game of the season, a game they lost by one run. They ended up with the same win–loss record as the Milwaukee Brewers, but it was the Brewers that advanced to the playoffs as they had a better in-division record. Kapler received three third-place votes for NL Manager of the Year.

====2021: NL Manager of the Year ====
Kapler began the 2021 season with a coaching staff of 13 that included nine who had never been on a major league staff before he hired them, and most of them were young enough to be playing themselves. Kapler won his 200th game as a manager in April 2021, becoming the first manager in MLB history with a 200–200 win–loss record over the first 400 games of his career.

In the 2021 regular season, his Giants won more games than any other major league team (107; with his team&#x27;s winning percentage rising from .483 to .660), the 12 overturns caused by his challenges were tied with those of LA&#x27;s Dave Roberts for the most in the majors, and he was one of only two managers who were not ejected during the season (along with Tampa Bay&#x27;s Kevin Cash). He used more pinch hitters per game than any other major league manager for the second season in a row (2.60), and the second-most pitchers per game (4.7). Kapler ended the 2021 season with a Giants managerial win-loss percentage of .613, third all-time of the Giants&#x27; 39 managers, behind only Hall of Famers Hughie Jennings and Rogers Hornsby, each of whom managed for less than a year nearly a century earlier.

Kapler&#x27;s players praised him for keeping open lines of communication with them throughout the season, which was especially important given that he used the team&#x27;s entire roster, shattering the MLB record for pinch-hit appearances as he exploited matchups aggressively.

Kapler was named the 2021 National League Manager of the Year by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, with 28 of a possible 30 first place votes. He became the second Giants manager to win the award, joining Dusty Baker, after managing the team to a franchise-record 107 wins and into the postseason for the first time in five years, despite pre-season projections that questioned the Giants&#x27; ability even to finish above .500 (Baseball Prospectus projected the team to win 75 games, entering the season).

Kapler was also named the &quot;Sporting News&quot; 2021 NL Manager of the Year, as 86% of his fellow National League managers voted for him.

On November 12, the Giants rewarded Kapler with a two-year contract extension through the 2024 season.

====2022====
In the aftermath of the Robb Elementary School Shooting and other mass shootings in the US, on May 27, 2022, Kapler announced he was not happy with the direction of the country. In protest, he said that he will not come out of the dugout for the national anthem until he deems the country to be back on a better track.

In 2022, Kapler used more pinch hitters per game, 1.63, than any other major league manager for the third season in a row.

====2023====
The Giants were eliminated with six games to play in the 2023 season, making it the third time in Kapler&#x27;s tenure that they did not reach the postseason. This happened on the heels of a slide that saw them go 2–8 on a home stand and win just three times in their last 17 road games. Responding to pitcher Logan Webb&#x27;s demand for making &quot;big changes,&quot; Kapler stated, &quot;We all have responsibility to raise the bar to the highest possible expectations, to not accept losing and expect to win every night and to go quickly back to make adjustments and we haven&#x27;t met that standard.&quot; The Giants fired Kapler three days later, with Kai Correa taking over as the interim manager for the remainder of the season.

===Managerial record===


==Front office career==
===Miami Marlins (2023–present)===
In December 2023, Kapler became an assistant general manager of the Miami Marlins of MLB. He will work under the Marlins&#x27; new president of baseball operations Peter Bendix, formerly a member of the Tampa Bay Rays front office during Kapler&#x27;s time with the team as a player in 2009–10. Kapler&#x27;s primary focus will be on player development within the Marlins’ system, and will be involved in all areas of baseball operations.

==Accolades==
In 2006 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Kapler lived in Tarzana, California, with his wife, Lisa (Jansen), whom he married in January 1999. They had two sons, and eventually the Kapler family moved to Northern Liberties, Philadelphia, after he became the manager of the Phillies and then to North Beach, San Francisco, after he became the manager of the Giants. He and his wife, whom he met in his senior year of high school, are now divorced.

Longtime &quot;Boston Globe&quot; columnist Bob Ryan—who said of Kapler &quot;He&#x27;s as smart as any player I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;—nicknamed him &quot;The Body&quot;. He is an avid weightlifter; his body fat count was reported in 2000 to be at 3.98%, and in 2012 to be at 3.5%. He was on the cover of several fitness magazines and became renowned for being the focus of an entire K-Swiss shoe campaign before he had even reached the pros. His blog discusses fitness, nutrition, health, and leadership.

Kapler and his wife co-founded the Gabe Kapler Foundation, which is dedicated to educating the public about domestic violence, and helping women escape abusive relationships.

In a clubhouse poll, it was once revealed that of the 25 players on the Red Sox, 24 were Republicans and Kapler was the one Democrat.

Kapler&#x27;s father died in December 2020 from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Lewy body dementia. Prior to the start of the 2022 season, Kapler received a prominent tattoo on his left hand to memorialize his father.

==Jewish heritage==
Kapler is Jewish, and to honor his heritage, has a Star of David tattooed on his left calf, with the inscription &quot;Strong Willed, Strong Minded&quot; in Hebrew, and the post-Holocaust motto &quot;Never Again&quot; with a flame and the dates of the Holocaust on his right calf. He describes his background as &quot;culturally Jewish... I was—and am—proud of my heritage, but don&#x27;t practice religion,&quot; and as to being a Jewish Major Leaguer said: &quot;That&#x27;s something I take great pride in... I&#x27;m very interested in my heritage and I&#x27;m very proud of who I am.&quot; He has 14 total tattoos.

Kapler has been given the nickname Hebrew Hammer due to his frequent longball hits, along with his muscularity and the fact that he is Jewish. It later became the nickname of Ryan Braun, who is also Jewish, and was Kapler&#x27;s teammate on the Brewers. On August 8, 2005, while playing for the Red Sox, Kapler took the field in the 9th inning along with Kevin Youkilis and Adam Stern, setting a &quot;record&quot; for the most Jewish players on the field at one time in American League history and the most in Major League Baseball history since four Jews took the field for the New York Giants in a game in 1941.

In 2008, with his career 69th home run he passed Art Shamsky and Lou Boudreau for 9th on the all-time list for home runs by Jewish major leaguers. Kapler was the unanimous winner of the 2008 Jewish Comeback Player of the Year award. Through 2018, he was 5th all-time in career stolen bases (behind Brad Ausmus) and 9th all-time in career doubles (behind Sid Gordon) among Jewish major league baseball players.

In 2018, Kapler became the eighth Jewish manager in MLB history. He joined Bob Melvin, Brad Ausmus, Jeff Newman, Norm Sherry, Lou Boudreau, Andy Cohen, and Lipman Pike.

<text>Steingrímur Jóhann Sigfússon (born 4 August 1955) is an Icelandic politician. He has been a member of the Althing (Icelandic parliament) since 1983 and was the founding chairman of the Left-Green Movement (&quot;Vinstri hreyfingin – grænt framboð&quot;) from 1999 until 2013. He was the Minister for Agriculture and Communications from 1988 to 1991. He was Minister of Finance from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, he took on the roles of Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture and Minister of Economic Affairs. He was first elected as a member of the People&#x27;s Alliance and helped found the Left-Green Movement after the merger of the People&#x27;s Alliance into the more moderate Social Democratic Alliance.

Steingrímur was born in Gunnarsstaðir, a large sheep farm between Garður and Þórshöfn in the Þistilfjörður region of northeast Iceland (Svalbarðshreppur municipality). In his younger days he was an avid sportsman, both track and field and also a volleyball player. On 16 January 2006, Steingrímur was injured in a car accident not far from Blönduós but later recovered.

He supported the end of the US military presence in Iceland, but believed Iceland itself should have taken the initiative in ending this presence. Since September 2006, when US forces left Naval Air Station Keflavik, he has strongly opposed any possible development of an Icelandic army seeing the country&#x27;s need for armed forces as practically non-existent. He believes that civilian institutions such as the police and the coast guard should be organized in order to provide the needed protection in the unlikely event of a major disturbance.

In November 2006, he published the book &quot;Við öll – Íslenskt velferðarsamfélag á tímamótum&quot; (&quot;All of Us – Icelandic Welfare Society at Crossroads&quot;), laying out his political ideology.

<text>Edward Cave (27 February 1691 – 10 January 1754) was an English printer, editor and publisher. He coined the term &quot;magazine&quot; for a periodical, founding &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1731, and was the first publisher to successfully fashion a wide-ranging publication.

== Early Life ==
The son of a cobbler, Cave was born in Newton near Rugby, Warwickshire, and attended Rugby School, but was expelled after being accused of stealing from the headmaster Henry Holyoake. He worked at a variety of jobs, including timber merchant, reporter and printer. 

== The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine ==
Cave conceived the idea of a periodical that would cover every topic the educated public was interested in, from commerce to poetry, and tried to convince several London printers and booksellers to take up the idea. When no one showed any interest, he took on the task himself. 

The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine was launched in 1731 and soon became the most influential and most imitated periodical of its time. It has been credited with giving the name magazine to its genre of periodical writing and editorial content. It originated as a repository of articles culled from other publications, mainly books and pamphlets. The magazine&#x27;s motto was &quot;E pluribus unum,&quot; which later became the tradition motto of the United States. Samuel Johnson joined the magazine in 1738, after which it started publishing reports and original writing. Cave too often contributed pieces to the Magazine under the pseudonym of Sylvanus Urban.

Cave was an astute businessman. He devoted all his energy to the magazine, and rarely left its offices at St John&#x27;s Gate, Clerkenwell. He made use of many contributors, most famously Samuel Johnson, who was always grateful to Cave for having provided his principal employment for many years. The magazine also made Cave wealthy. 

He also obtained a licence from Lewis Paul for 250 spindles for his patent roller-spinning machine, a precursor of the water frame. In 1742 he bought Marvel&#x27;s Mill at Northampton and converted this to a cotton mill, probably the first water-powered spinning mill in the world. This was apparently profitable, but only modestly so. It closed in 1761, or soon after.

== Death ==
Cave suffered from gout. He is buried at St. James Church, Clerkenwell.

<text>The Labour Youth Union of Albania (Albanian: &quot;Bashkimi i Rinisë së Punës së Shqipërisë&quot;) was the youth organization of the Party of Labour of Albania. Founded on November 23, 1941 as the Communist Youth it was officially described as the &quot;&quot;greatest revolutionary force of inexhaustible strength&quot; and a &quot;strong fighting reserve of the party&quot;&quot; it was a key organization for political socialization in socialist Albania. It was affiliated with the Democratic Front.

== Organization==
The union operated directly under the Party of Labour of Albania, with its local organs supervised by the relevant district or city party committees. Founded in 1941, the union was considered one of the most important auxiliaries of the party. Organized in the same way as the party, the union had city and district committees, and higher organs, including the politburo and Central Committee. It was patterned after All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League, known as Komsomol, in the Soviet Union.

=== Membership ===
The more than 200,000 members of the union ranged in age from fifteen to twenty-five. The union was responsible for controlling all Pioneer organizations, which embraced children from seven to fourteen years of age; for implementing party directives among youth; and for mobilizing so-called volunteer labor brigades to work on special economic projects. Membership in the union was a prerequisite for those aspiring to a career in the party or state apparatus.

==Pioneer of Albania==
The union had under its wing the Pioneers of Enver, formerly known simply as the pioneer movement, which had started in World War II, with the Debatik, a youth scout movement, created in 1942.

<doc id="893836" wikidata="Q7886500" url="?curid=893836" title="Union of Albanian Women">
<text>Union of Albanian Women (Unioni i Grave Shqiptare) was an important mass organization in socialist Albania, founded in 1943 and dissolved in 1992. As with other mass organizations and associations during the time period, it was affiliated with the Democratic Front.

==History==
The Union of Albanian Women was founded as a branch of the Communist Party in 1943, and named the name Anti-Fascist Women of Albania (or Antifascist Women&#x27;s Union). It changed name to Union of Albanian Women during its 1946 congress. 

Its task was mobilizing the political and social activities of the country&#x27;s women, handling their ideological training, and leading the campaign for the emancipation of women. This campaign, initiated in 1966 by Hoxha, had considerable success in securing equal social and political rights for women. As part of the campaign, women from the cities were dispatched to rural regions to explain to the party&#x27;s line on the role of women. By the late-1980s, women accounted for 47 percent of the labor force and about 30 percent of deputies to the People&#x27;s Assembly. Women held responsible jobs at all levels of government and received equal pay in most jobs.

The union was headed until 1946 by Ollga Plumbi, in 1946-1952 by Nexhmije Hoxha, in 1952-1982 by Vito Kapo, and in 1990 by Lumturie Rexha, a member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania. 

The Union of Albanian Women was dissolved in 1992.

<text>A canovaccio is a scenario used by &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; players. It consisted only of a list of acts and scenes; the details were left to the improvisation of the actors. Actors in the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; thus had to be endowed with an inventive mind since the success of the play depended largely on their creativity and above all on their &quot;lazzi&quot; (jokes and gags). The spotlight fell on the actors rather than on the play itself.

The use of improvisation on top of &quot;canovaccio&quot; enabled the avoidance of censorship because censors cannot censor that which is not written. Since the dialogue was almost entirely improvised on stage, actors and theatre companies could get away with almost anything.

In the late 19th century scholars began searching for documentary sources on the history of the theatre in Italy. Over a thousand documents in manuscript or print were discovered that consisted of &quot;canovacci&quot; in numerous collections or individually, and usually anonymous.

<text>The College of Letters and Science is the largest college of the University of California, Davis. 

In 1922, to shut down agricultural interests&#x27; proposals to sever the University Farm at Davis from the University of California, Berkeley, the Regents of the University of California authorized a two-year undergraduate program at Davis. This initial project soon evolved into a four-year undergraduate program leading to the degree of bachelor of science in agriculture, which was first awarded at Davis in 1926. 

Several of the college&#x27;s departments date back to 1922, when they were initially formed as &quot;divisions&quot;. In other words, they were off-site divisions of departments of various colleges at Berkeley. Originally, such faculty members based at Davis or shared by Berkeley with Davis were there to merely support students earning the degree of bachelor of science in agriculture. In contrast, students who actually wanted a complete liberal arts education or to major in other fields towards the degree of bachelor of arts needed to go to the Berkeley campus. 

In 1951, the College of Letters and Science at Davis was formed as a full-fledged college in its own right, and absorbed several existing divisions as its first departments, and in 1959, Davis achieved full administrative independence from Berkeley as a general campus of the UC system. 

Initially composed of 14 majors and 70 faculty members, the College of Letters and Science now has over 14,000 undergraduate students, 1,500 graduate students, 100,000 alumni, and 900 faculty, and offers more than 53 majors and 60 minors. The College of Letters and Science has over 55 departments and programs, 14 centers, labs, and museums, and received over 33 million dollars in research awards (2017–18).

<text>Subrata Roy (10 June 1948 – 14 November 2023) was an Indian businessman who founded the business conglomerate Sahara India Pariwar in 1978.

Sahara India Pariwar operated a vast number of businesses, such as Aamby Valley City, Sahara Movie Studios, Air Sahara, Uttar Pradesh Wizards, and Filmy, among others.

Roy was named the tenth-most influential Indian businessman in 2012 by &quot;India Today&quot;. In 2004, the Sahara group was termed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;the second largest employer in India after Indian Railways&quot;. Sahara operates through more than 5,000 establishments across India and has a workforce of around 1.2 million (field and office) under the Sahara India umbrella.

== Early life ==
Subrata Roy was born into a Bengali Hindu family in Araria on 10 June 1948 to Sudhir Chandra Roy and Chhabi Roy. His father and mother came from Dhaka, Bikrampur, East Bengal (now Bangladesh) from a rich landlord family named &quot;Bhagyakul Zamindar&quot;.

Roy studied at Holy Child Institute in Kolkata and later studied mechanical engineering at Government Technical Institute, Gorakhpur. Roy started his first business in Gorakhpur.

== Business career ==

Roy joined Sahara Finance, a struggling company, in 1976, that ran a chit fund and took it over. He changed its financial model in 1978. Sahara is said to have used the financial model of much older Peerless Group. They are termed residuary non-banking companies (RNBCs) that accept deposits of very low amounts.

In the 1990s, Roy moved to Lucknow which became the base of his group. From there, it went on to become the largest conglomerate of India with a diversified range of business interests. The company now has interests in financial services, education, real estate, media, entertainment, tourism, healthcare, and hospitality.

The Hindi language newspaper &quot;Rashtriya Sahara&quot; was started in 1992. In the late 1990s, the ambitious Aamby Valley City project near Pune was initiated. In 2000, Sahara TV was launched which was later renamed Sahara One.
In 2003, Sahara started three weeklies: Sahara Time (English), Sahara Samay (Hindi), and Sahara Aalmi (Urdu).

In 2010, Sahara purchased the iconic Grosvenor House Hotel in London, and then in 2012 the historic Plaza Hotel and Dream Downtown Hotel in New York City.

Sahara has a workforce of around 1.2 million including salaried employees, consultants, field workers, agents, and business associates, etc. In 2004, Sahara group was termed by Time magazine as &quot;the second-largest employer in India&quot; after the Government-run Indian Railways.

Sahara is said to have nine crore plus investors and depositors, representing about 13% of all households in India.

Roy was planning to foray into online education (Edunguru) in India, which was targeted at small towns and villages. He put a team in place which consists of members from top universities and colleges across India, and even abroad. The route map of the program was prepared, and 14,000 hours of lectures were developed for this.

In June 2019, Roy announced his foray into the automobile sector under the brand name &#x27;Sahara Evols&#x27;. The Sahara Evols venture is offering a wide range of electric vehicles (EVs) along with advanced allied services.

== Legal issues ==

On 26 February 2014, the Supreme Court of India ordered the detention of Roy for failing to appear before it in connection with legal dispute with Market Regulator – SEBI. In a statement after the arrest, his lawyer said Roy&#x27;s 92-year-old mother was in poor health and needed &quot;her eldest son&quot; by her side, and hence he failed to appear at the court. As he failed to appear in the court during the ongoing legal battle, Roy was held in custody in the Tihar Jail, Delhi and was out on parole since May 2016. Sahara was allowed to sell a part of its assets in India to raise part of the money in question.

Roy rejected allegations of misconduct and accused the Indian National Congress of a witch hunt due to his opposition to Sonia Gandhi becoming the country&#x27;s prime minister.

Initially he was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 26 March 2014 on condition of depositing crore to the market regulator SEBI. His deposit of ₹10,000 crore was not made. As of August 2014, Roy was trying to sell some of his hotel properties to raise enough money. Roy was granted his first bail in May 2017 for four weeks to perform the last rites for his deceased mother, later extended to 24 October. From that time on he was successful in getting his bail extended on various grounds. As of 31 January 2019, Sahara still had to pay ₹10,621 crore to meet its total liability.

Roy claimed that the company&#x27;s fundamentals were intact and assets were greater (3 to 5 times) than the liabilities. Sahara also deposited ₹22,500 crores, of which it has been surmised will in due course of justice come back to Sahara India as it has already repaid 95% of its investors.
The Securities And Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has repaid only crore to the investors since 2012. It has also been reported that Sahara has paid crore as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009–2010 and 2012–2013. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara&#x27;s arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why the other cannot do so.

On 28 August 2020, two petitions were filed against the release of the Netflix documentary &quot;Bad Boy Billionaires: India&quot; in the Bihar District Court. The Bihar Court passed an interim stay order on the petition filed by Roy against the release of the documentary on the Netflix platform. Following the stay order by the Bihar court, Netflix threatened to move the Supreme Court against the court order for restraining the documentary release.

On 5 October 2020, Netflix released three out of four films in the anthology, including those featuring Vijay Mallya (&quot;The King of Good Times&quot;), Nirav Modi (&quot;Diamonds Aren&#x27;t Forever&quot;), and Subrata Roy (&quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Family&quot;), while the final episode about Ramalinga Raju remained encumbered by legal injunctions and as of December 2020 has yet to be released.

== Humanitarian efforts ==
In 2013, Sahara contributed to the relief efforts in flood hit Uttarakhand region wherein one lakh bottles of drinking water, packaged juice and food packets along with candles and match boxes were said to be provided by them. There were 25 medical health unit vans equipped with doctors and free medicines made available and it was said by the group that, they will contribute to the rehabilitation programme by constructing 10,000 pre-fabricated houses.

After the Kargil War, Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee praised Sahara India for providing financial support to the 127 families of martyrs.

Hotel Sahara Star in Mumbai partnered with Feeding India in 2021. As a part of its CSR initiatives, the hotel provides food to hungry people.

==Death==

Roy died due to cardiorespiratory arrest following an extended battle with complications arising from metastatic malignancy, hypertension and diabetes on 14 November 2023, at age 75. He had been admitted to Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital &amp; Medical Research Institute in Mumbai on 12 November following a decline in health.

== Awards and honours ==
Roy received an honorary doctorate in business leadership from the University of East London in 2013, a Business Icon of the Year award at the Powerbrands Hall of Fame Awards in London in 2011 and was the ITA – TV Icon of the Year in 2007. He received the Global Leadership Award in 2004.
Roy was awarded a general jury award by the Indian Television Academy Awards and an honorary degree of D.Litt. by Lalit Narayan Mithila University, Darbhanga.

Roy featured regularly in the &quot;India Today&quot; list of 50 Most Powerful People of India since 2003 and was named its tenth-most influential businessmen in 2012.

<doc id="893846" wikidata="Q2907736" url="?curid=893846" title="Bob Layton">
<text>Bob Layton (born September 25, 1953) is an American comic book artist, writer, and editor. He is best known for his work on Marvel Comics titles such as &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot;, and for co-founding Valiant Comics with Jim Shooter.

==Early life==
Bob Layton was born on September 25, 1953. He learned to read comics from the age of four, explaining that his &quot;older sister Sue became bored with reading the same comic to me about fifty times. (It was a &quot;Showcase&quot; featuring the Challengers of the Unknown.)&quot;

After leaving high school, Layton began &quot;playing comics dealer ... selling them out of his apartment in Indianapolis,&quot; through which he met Roger Stern in 1973, while the latter was working for a radio station in Indianapolis.

==Career==
===CPL===
Layton and Stern began publishing a fanzine called &quot;CPL&quot; (&quot;Contemporary Pictorial Literature&quot;) out of Layton&#x27;s apartment.

Stern recalls that, &quot;&quot;CPL&quot; started out as Bob&#x27;s sale catalog. Bob was drawing the covers and including little reviews written by some of his customers. By issue #5, it turned into a small &#x27;zine with a catalog insert, and I started writing short articles for it. I eventually became an editor of sorts.&quot;

&quot;CPL&quot; rapidly became a popular fan publication, and led to the two forming an alliance with Charlton Comics to produce and publish &quot;the now-famous &quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot; magazine.&quot; During the mid-1970s, both Marvel and DC were publishing in-house &quot;fan&quot; publications (&quot;F.O.O.M.&quot; and &quot;The Amazing World of DC Comics&quot; respectively), and Charlton wished to make inroads into the superhero market, as well as &quot;establish a fan presence&quot;, leading to the alliance with CPL to produce the &quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot;. This led to Charlton giving Layton and Stern &quot;access to unpublished material from their vaults by the likes of Steve Ditko, Jeff Jones and a host of others.&quot; This association with Charlton (and Bill Pearson, production manager) in turn led to Layton becoming acquainted with the legendary Wally Wood, with whom he apprenticed. This apprenticeship led to work for Charlton on anthology titles, but not working from the Charlton offices, Marvel Comics and DC Comics, while still publishing fanzines.

===Marvel Comics and DC Comics===
Layton&#x27;s first, albeit uncredited, work for Marvel Comics was inking a single page in the Marvel UK title &quot;The Avengers and the Savage Sword of Conan&quot; #135 (April 17, 1976).

Part of Layton&#x27;s role as Wally Wood&#x27;s apprentice included him occasionally delivering artwork to &quot;NYC from Connecticut.&quot; Layton recalls that:

Layton&#x27;s reaction was one of panic, and his search for help to meet the deadline led him to Dick Giordano and Neal Adams&#x27; Continuity Associates where his &quot;fledgling contemporaries,&quot; the Crusty Bunkers (&quot;Terry Austin, Bob Wiacek, Joe Rubinstein, Bob McLeod, Joe Brozowski, Carl Potts and a host of others&quot;) were able to lend a hand and help him finish the book.

A month later, Layton received a package containing &quot;an entire issue of pencils on the &quot;Champions&quot;&quot;, and discovered that he was &quot;the new regular inker on the book.&quot; He worked for Marvel &quot;for about a year, then signed an exclusive one-year contract with DC — after they made me &#x27;an offer I couldn&#x27;t refuse&#x27;.&quot;

Layton began work for DC Comics in early 1977, taking up regular inking duties on &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, as well as inking multiple issues of &quot;Secret Society of Super Villains&quot;, &quot;DC Super Stars&quot;, and &quot;DC Special&quot;, among others. In Nov./Dec. 1977, he inked the first issue of David Michelinie&#x27;s &quot;Star Hunters&quot;, and after a number of other shorter inking jobs, moved back to Marvel in 1978, to ultimately take up one of his best remembered roles.

In 1978, Layton reunited with Michelinie, to co-write &quot;Iron Man&quot;. The two would become regular creative partners, and began their collaboration on &quot;Iron Man&quot; with #116 (November 1978). Micheline and Layton established Tony Stark&#x27;s alcoholism with the story &quot;Demon in a Bottle&quot;, and introduced several supporting characters, including Stark&#x27;s bodyguard girlfriend Bethany Cabe; Stark&#x27;s personal pilot and confidant James Rhodes, who later became the superhero War Machine; and rival industrialist Justin Hammer, who was revealed to be the employer of numerous high-tech armed enemies Iron Man fought over the years. The duo introduced the concept of Stark&#x27;s specialized armors The two collaborated on the title until #154 and then returned for a second run from #215 (Feb. 1987) to #250 (Dec 1989).

Layton continued to ink and work on covers for titles such as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot;, and &quot;Micronauts&quot;. In September 1982, he launched one of Marvel&#x27;s first limited series, writing and drawing the four-issue &quot;Hercules: Prince of Power&quot;. Its success spawned a four-issue sequel in 1984 and a 1988 graphic novel (#37 in the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; series) - &quot;Full Circle&quot;. Around this time, he designed the highly successful &quot;Marvel Secret Wars&quot; toy line for Mattel, which formed the impetus behind the 1984 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event. Layton was one of the inkers on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #18 (1984) which featured the wedding of Spider-Man supporting characters J. Jonah Jameson and Marla Madison in a story written by Stan Lee.

In February 1986, Layton revived the original X-Men characters in the series &quot;X-Factor&quot;, which he wrote and Jackson Guice drew. Layton wrote the first five issues before handing over the series to Louise Simonson. Michelinie and Layton became the creative team on &quot;Iron Man&quot; once again in issue #215 (Feb. 1987) They crafted the &quot;Armor Wars&quot; storyline which ran from #225 (Dec. 1987) through #231 (June 1988). After Michelinie and Layton finished their second &quot;Iron Man&quot; run with issue #250, Layton returned to the title briefly to write and draw #254 and write #256 before leaving Marvel. A year later, he returned to the comics industry to ink Jim Shooter&#x27;s &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; #1, from Valiant Comics.

===Valiant Comics===
Bob Layton was one of the chief architects of the Valiant Universe, along with Jim Shooter, Barry Windsor-Smith, Steven J. Massarsky, and Jon Hartz. He co-created a number of the core characters including X-O Manowar, and later became Editor-in-Chief and Senior Vice President, during which time he controlled the company during its most profitable period.

His first Valiant work appeared in &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; #1 (May 1991), in which he inked Art Nichols&#x27; artwork from Jim Shooter&#x27;s script. He would continue with &quot;Magnus&quot; for five issues and produce covers to issue #9, while inking the inaugural issues of &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom&quot;, which he edited. In February 1992, he co-created with Shooter and Steve Englehart and penciled the first issue of &quot;X-O Manowar&quot;, after which he handed over the core art duties to Sal Velluto, but provided inks for #2. The following month he drew the cover to David Michelinie&#x27;s &quot;Rai.&quot;

In August 1992, he co-wrote, edited and inked &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot; #1, edited and provided pencilwork on &quot;Eternal Warrior&quot; #1, and inked Barry Windsor-Smith on &quot;Unity&quot; #0. Starting in November 1992, he co-edited with Dark Horse publisher Mike Richardson the &quot;Predator/Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; two-issue crossover, and in December was again inking and editing a Michelinie-written comic book series: &quot;H.A.R.D. Corps&quot;. Layton edited &quot;Turok, Dinosaur Hunter&quot;, &quot;Deathmate&quot; and &quot;Secret Weapons&quot; before writing the first of thirteen issues of &quot;The Second Life of Doctor Mirage&quot;. He was editing a vast array of titles during this time, for which he won the Editor of the Year award in 1993, as voted by the readers of the comics magazine, &quot;Wizard&quot;.

His workload decreased greatly towards the end of 1994, in large part due to the sale of Valiant (Voyager Communications, Inc.) to video game giant Acclaim Entertainment for $65,000,000.00 USD, a deal in which Layton played an instrumental part. His story concepts and design work on &quot;Turok, Dinosaur Hunter&quot; was utilized to great effect by Acclaim when the video game became the largest selling title in Acclaim&#x27;s history, with over 1.5 million units sold. He continued to work editorially, largely for the new Acclaim imprint Armada Comics, for which he edited a number of &quot;&quot; comics during 1995-96. He edited Bob Hall&#x27;s four-issue &quot;Armed &amp; Dangerous&quot; (April–July 1996), and returned to &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; for which he wrote the final three issues.

After a several-year association with Valiant/Acclaim, Layton moved to Florida for a short retirement. Although he found time to write the first eleven (of twelve) issues of Acclaim&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Tomorrow&quot; between 1997 and 1998, inking a couple of issues, notably #6 which was drawn by Dick Giordano, who resided in Florida as well and was something of a mentor to Layton.

===Return to DC and Marvel===
In 1998, he returned to DC, re-teaming briefly with penciler Sal Velluto on a story in September 1998&#x27;s &quot;The New Gods Secret Files and Origins&quot;, before collabotaring with his fellow Floridian and artistic friend/mentor Dick Giordano on several projects. The two-issue prestige format Elseworlds tale &quot;Batman: Dark Knight of the Round Table&quot; was co-drawn and co-inked by the both of them, from a script by Layton and debuted a month after their six-issue mini-series &quot;The L.A.W. (Living Assault Weapons)&quot;, which ran from September 1999 to February 2000, with script and inks by Layton, and full pencils by Giordano. The two wrote a second Batman Elseworlds tale, &quot;Batman: Hollywood Knight&quot; a three-issue mini-series which told the story of a Serials-actor who became convinced he was The Batman. It was written by Layton with pencils and inks by Giordano.

Between Elseworlds, Layton worked with Marvel Comics on an Iron Man reunion, which saw him produce the four-part limited series &quot;Iron Man: Bad Blood&quot; with his long-term collaborator David Michelinie. The series ran from September to December 2000, with art by Layton and, as previously, the plot was a joint effort, and the final script by Michelinie. Layton then stayed at Marvel for a short time, teaming with Dan Jurgens as inker on &quot;Captain America&quot; (#38-50), as well as inking a short run on &quot;The Avengers&quot; (#44-47). He inked the Dan Jurgens-drawn &quot;The Power Company: Manhunter&quot; and part of &quot;Just Imagine Stan Lee ... Secret Files and Origins&quot; for DC in March 2002.

===2000s===

In December 2000, Layton launched Future Comics, with Dick Giordano, Allen Berrebbi, and David Michelinie. Layton acted as editor-in-chief, Berrebbi was CFO and director of marketing, Michelinie was head writer, Giordano was art director, and Skip Farrell was the publisher. Between 2000 and 2002, they prepared to revolutionize the direct market system by bypassing distributors and selling direct to customers and shops through the Internet.

In August 2002, &quot;Freemind&quot; #0 was released. Edited and inked by Layton, written by Layton and Michelinie, and with pencils by Giordano, it was followed by another title, &quot;Metallix&quot;, before the company bowed to pressure and signed with distributor Diamond Comics Distribution in an attempt to maximize sales while maintaining their independent approach. Ultimately, after three titles the third was &quot;Deathmask&quot;, and seventeen total issues, the company was not making enough money to survive, and it folded, with one announced title — &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; — unpublished.

Layton&#x27;s work continues to be collected in multiple trade paperback collections. In 2006, he produced a number of variant covers to issues of Superverse Comics&#x27; &quot;Zoom Suit&quot;, written by John Taddeo, and in 2007 his work was featured in issues of Marvel&#x27;s encyclopedic &quot;All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update&quot;. Layton worked for Marvel as a freelance artist and writer on several projects including the miniseries &quot;Iron Man: Legacy of Doom&quot; and &quot;Iron Man: The End&quot;.

He continues to enjoy doing commission work, writing:

Layton has been quoted as saying that he &quot;miss[es] telling stories,&quot; and to that end has showcased unpublished issues of Future Comics properties on his website, where he presented his serialized comic&quot; &quot;Colony&quot;, with art by Giordano, and which &quot;is a project that [Layton has] been developing for [over] 10 years and is currently making the rounds in Hollywood.&quot; Other potential film deals for the Future Comics characters are reportedly semi-ongoing.

<doc id="893850" wikidata="Q11022340" url="?curid=893850" title="Canto">
<text>The canto () is a principal form of division in medieval and modern long poetry.

==Etymology and equivalent terms==
The word &quot;canto&quot; is derived from the Italian word for &quot;song&quot; or &quot;singing&quot;, which comes from the Latin &quot;cantus&quot;, &quot;song&quot;, from the infinitive verb &quot;canere&quot;, &quot;to sing&quot;.

In Old Saxon poetry, Old English poetry, and Middle English poetry, the term &quot;fitt&quot; was sometimes used to denote a section of a long narrative poem, and that term is sometimes used in modern scholarship of this material instead of &quot;canto&quot;.

==Form and use==
The use of the canto was described in the 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as &quot;a convenient division when poetry was more usually sung by the minstrel to his own accompaniment than read&quot;. There is no specific format, construction or style for a canto and it is not limited to any one type of poetry.

The typical length of a canto varies greatly from one poem to another. The average canto in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; is 142 lines long, while the average canto in &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; is 882 lines long.

==Examples==
Some famous poems that employ the canto division are Ezra Pound&#x27;s &quot;The Cantos&quot; (116 cantos), Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (with 100 cantos), Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (49 cantos), Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (46 cantos), Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Gerusalemme liberata&quot; (20 cantos), Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot; (17 cantos, the last of which is unfinished) and Camões&#x27; &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; (10 cantos).

The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1994 through August 1995.

Both networks would ultimately shutdown and merge to form The CW in September 2006.

<text>Mingju (Manchu:, Mölendroff: &quot;mingju&quot;; , November 19, 1635 – June 3, 1708), of the Manchu Nara clan, was an official of the Qing Dynasty during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. He was thrown in prison for corruption.

Second cousin to the Shunzhi Emperor, Mingzhu came from an aristocratic line that belonged to the Plain Yellow Banner of the Eight Banners. His grandfather, Gintaisi, was the last prince of the Yehe Nara clan.

In 1677, Mingju was named the Grand Secretary, one of the top-ranking positions, and became involved in a long power struggle with Songgotu throughout the middle years of Kangxi&#x27;s reign. He was related to Consort Hui, one of the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s concubines who bore the emperor his first surviving son, Yinzhi. Consequently, he supported Yinzhi during the struggles for succession.

He was sent to prison for corruption and various other charges in his final years.

He married Ajige&#x27;s fifth daughter and had at least three sons. His oldest son, Nara Singde, grew up to be a famous poet.

<doc id="893867" wikidata="Q845033" url="?curid=893867" title="Neo-Ricardianism">
<text>The neo-Ricardian school is an economic school of thought 
that derives from the close reading and interpretation of David Ricardo by Piero Sraffa, and from Sraffa&#x27;s critique of neoclassical economics as presented in his &quot;The Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot;, and further developed by the neo-Ricardians in the course of the Cambridge capital controversy. It particularly disputes neoclassical theory of income distribution. Robert Rowthorn, in his 1974 article, Neo-classicism, neo-Ricardianism and Marxism in the New Left Review (I, 86), coined the name. Franklin Delano Roosevelt III, with his dissertation, &quot;Towards a Marxist Critique of the Cambridge School&quot;, put forth a similar view. The name &quot;Sraffian economics&quot; is also used.

Prominent neo-Ricardians are usually held to include Pierangelo Garegnani, Krishna Bharadwaj, Luigi Pasinetti, Joan Robinson, John Eatwell, Fernando Vianello, Murray Milgate, Ian Steedman, Heinz D. Kurz, Neri Salvadori, Bertram Schefold, Fabio Petri, Massimo Pivetti, Franklin Serrano, Fabio Ravagnani, Roberto Ciccone, Sergio Parrinello, Alessandro Roncaglia, Maurice Dobb, Gilbert Abraham-Frois, Theodore Mariolis and Giorgio Gilibert.

The school partially overlaps with post-Keynesian and neo-Marxian economics.

<doc id="893871" wikidata="Q639115" url="?curid=893871" title="Lieutenant Governor of Texas">
<text>The lieutenant governor of Texas is the second-highest executive office in the government of Texas, a state in the U.S. It is the second most powerful post in Texas government because its occupant controls the work of the Texas Senate and controls the budgeting process as a leader of the Legislative Budget Board.

Under the provisions of the Texas Constitution, the lieutenant governor is president of the Texas Senate. Unlike with most other states&#x27; senates and the U.S. Senate, the lieutenant governor regularly presides over the chamber rather than delegating this function to the president pro tempore or a majority leader. By the rules of the Senate, the lieutenant governor establishes all special and standing committees, appoints all chairpersons and members, and assigns all Senate legislation to the committee of his choice. The lieutenant governor decides all questions of parliamentary procedure in the Senate. The lieutenant governor also has broad discretion in following Senate procedural rules.

The lieutenant governor is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of several statutory bodies, including the Legislative Budget Board, the Legislative Council, and the Legislative Audit Committee, which have considerable sway over state programs, the budget and policy. The lieutenant governor is also a member of the Legislative Redistricting Board (together with the speaker of the House, attorney general, comptroller, and land commissioner), which is charged with adopting a redistricting plan for the Texas House of Representatives, Texas Senate, or U.S. House of Representatives after the decennial census if the Legislature fails to do so.

In the case of a vacancy in the lieutenant governor&#x27;s office, the Senate elects one of its members to act as &quot;President of the Senate&quot; until the next statewide office election, in effect becoming the lieutenant governor. A senator elected as presiding officer in this way retains their district seat and the voting privileges entailed with his Senate election.
The lieutenant governor is sworn in on the third Tuesday every four years, the same as the governor.

Dan Patrick has been the lieutenant governor of Texas since January 20, 2015.

The term of office was two years from 1846 to 1972. Voters then increased it to four years, effective for the 1974 election.

The lieutenant governor assumes the powers of the governor of Texas when the governor is out of the state or otherwise unable to discharge the office. The lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor, rather than on the same ticket; it is therefore possible for the governor and lieutenant governor to be from different political parties (which was the case during Governor George W. Bush&#x27;s first term and also during Bill Clements&#x27;s two non-consecutive terms). The lieutenant governor becomes the governor if the elected governor resigns, dies or is removed from office via impeachment and conviction. Former governor Rick Perry took office upon George W. Bush&#x27;s resignation on December 21, 2000, ahead of Bush becoming U.S. president. When Perry became lieutenant governor on January 19, 1999, he became the first Republican since Albert Jennings Fountain in 1873 to serve as lieutenant governor, and the first Republican to be elected as lieutenant governor since James W. Flanagan in 1869.

==Compared to other lieutenant governors==
Texas is one of the few states that vests significant power in the office of lieutenant governor, making it among the most influential. By contrast, the lieutenant governor position in other states has few (if any) legislative responsibilities, akin to the vice president of the United States.

<text>Alpen is a line of muesli varieties manufactured by the Weetabix cereal company of Kettering, Northamptonshire, England.

==History==
Weetabix cereals in the UK created Alpen muesli cereal in 1971. Alpen is a whole grain muesli cereal consisting of rolled oats, fruits and nuts.

In the UK, Alpen has been a staple on British shelves since the 1970s, accounting for 3% of the UK and Ireland breakfast cereal sales in 2003. It appeared in the early 1970s in Canada and then in the US in the 1990s after Weetabix established a partnership with natural foods manufacturer, Barbara&#x27;s Bakery.

In North America, Alpen No Added Sugar and Alpen Original are mainstays in U.S. natural food stores and Canadian grocery stores. In the UK, Weetabix sells Alpen in four varieties. Alpen is exported to other countries in several varieties.

==Related cereals and products==

In the UK, Alpen has created several varieties, including:
*Alpen Original
*Alpen Original (No Added Sugar)
*Alpen Chocolate
*Alpen High Fruit
*Alpen High Fibre

In both the U.S.and Canada, Alpen varieties are:

*Alpen Original
*Alpen No Added Sugar
*New Alpen Apple Spice was introduced in Canada in 2010, featuring three whole grains, apples, toasted soy nuggets and flax seed, with 500 mg of Omega ALA.

As of December 2009, the U.S. Alpens were reformulated to an all-natural formula, discontinuing the use of added vitamins, minerals and organic grains.

In the past, several non-muesli Alpen cereals debuted under the Alpen brand. While most of these cereals have undergone changes in name only, here is a list of cereals which at one point were in the Alpen division of Weetabix, along with date of name change.

*Alpen Wheat Flakes (formerly Advantage cereal) — 2004
*Alpen Crunchy Bran (formerly Crunchy Bran cereal) — 2004

As a brand extension and a reaction to consumer appetite for whole grain snacks, Weetabix introduced Alpen whole grain cereal bars, which include varieties of several fruit flavours. As of January 2025, the lower-calorie Alpen Delight line, which replaced the Alpen Light line in 2023, includes:

*Chocolate Brownie
*Salted Caramel
*White Chocolate Raspberry &amp; Shortcake
*Chocolate, Caramel, &amp; Shortbread
*Chocolate Honeycomb
*Raspberry Rocky Road

The Alpen Bars line includes:

*Strawberry &amp; Yogurt (red)

<doc id="893889" wikidata="Q580836" url="?curid=893889" title="Yardang">
<text>A yardang is a streamlined protuberance carved from bedrock or any consolidated or semiconsolidated material by the dual action of wind abrasion by dust and sand and deflation (the removal of loose material by wind turbulence). Yardangs become elongated features typically three or more times longer than wide, and when viewed from above, resemble the hull of a boat. Facing the wind is a steep, blunt face that gradually gets lower and narrower toward the lee end. Yardangs are formed by wind erosion, typically of an originally flat surface formed from areas of harder and softer material. The soft material is eroded and removed by the wind, and the harder material remains. The resulting pattern of yardangs is therefore a combination of the original rock distribution, and the fluid mechanics of the air flow and resulting pattern of erosion.

==Names==
The word itself is of Turkic origin, meaning ‘steep bank’, as this type of spectacular landscapes rising are best developed in the interior deserts of this region. And the word was first introduced to the English-speaking world by the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin in 1903. In China, they are sometimes known as yadan from the Chinese adaptation of the Uyghur form of the same name.

Other names for them are &quot;mud-lions&quot;, &quot;mushroom rocks&quot;, &quot;sphinx-like hills&quot;, &quot;koukour&quot; in Tunisia, and &quot;kalut&quot; (Persian for &quot;ridge&quot;) in Iran. The massive features of mega-yardangs are called &quot;ridges and corridors&quot; (&quot;&quot;) in French.
==Description==
A yardang is formed in cohesive material. Hedin first found the wind-sculptured &quot;clay terraces&quot; or yardangs in the dried up riverbed of the Kurruk-daria in Central Asia. However, yardangs can be found in most deserts across the globe. Depending upon the winds and the composition of the weakly indurated deposits of silt and sand from which they are carved, yardangs may form very unusual shapes — some resemble various objects, people or even lying lions.

Yardangs come in a large range of sizes, and are divided into three different categories: mega-yardangs, meso-yardangs, and micro-yardangs. Mega-yardangs can be several kilometers long and hundreds of meters high and are found in arid regions with strong winds; meso-yardangs are generally a few meters high and 10 to 15 meters long and are commonly found carved in semiconsolidated playa sediments and other soft granular materials; and micro-yardangs are only a few centimeters high.

A large concentration of mega-yardangs occurs near the Tibesti Mountains in the central Sahara. There is a famous yardang at Hole in the Rock in Papago Park in Phoenix, Arizona, a rock formation with a roughly circular hole in it. Another yardang in Arizona is Window Rock, near the town of Window Rock. It is a 60-meter sandstone hill with a very large circular hole in the middle of it. Some geologists have suggested that the Great Sphinx of Egypt is an augmented yardang.
Pictures from Mars show that the yardang ridges occur on a massive scale there; some individual ridges are tens of kilometers long with intervening valleys nearly 1 km wide. Yardangs on Mars are typically found in the Amazonis region but the best ones are found in the equatorial region. Yardangs on Mars demonstrate that much of the eolian erosion is recent since they are sculpted in young geologic units.

==Formation==
Explaining the formation of yardangs is challenging. It occurs due to the coupled evolution of complex flow fields and three-dimensional (3D) topographies in the context of harder or less erodible material embedded in softer material. The carving of the geometrical features is generated by differential erosion caused by flow strength, flow funneling, and turbulent wakes.

Yardangs are formed in environments where water is scarce and the prevailing winds are strong, uni-directional, and carry an abrasive sediment load. The wind cuts down low-lying areas into parallel ridges which gradually erode into separate hills that take on the unique shape of a yardang. This process yields a field of yardangs of roughly the same size, commonly referred to as a fleet due to their resemblance to the bottoms of ships. Alternatively, one can be formed by the migration of a dune that leaves behind a cemented core. As the process of formation continues, typically a trough will form around the base of the yardang. Most yardang fields are in sand-poor areas, but the associated troughs, especially in grooved terrain, may be invaded by sand. Sometimes this sand will accumulate to build shallow moats around the bottom.

They are more commonly created from softer rock types like siltstone, sandstone, tuff or Ignimbrite, shale, and limestone, but have also been observed in crystalline rocks such as schist and gneiss.

<doc id="893897" wikidata="Q4591090" url="?curid=893897" title="1995–96 United States network television schedule">
<text>The 1995–96 network television schedule for the six major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers the primetime hours from September 1995 to August 1996. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 1994–95 season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 1996 is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

This is the first fall season for The WB and UPN. The schedules of either network would not be constant until fall 1999, when the WB decided to air shows from Sunday through Friday and UPN would air Monday through Friday. This is also the first television season to officially end in the month of May.

New series highlighted in bold.

Repeat airings or same-day rebroadcasts are indicated by .

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

All sporting events air live in all time zones in U.S. Eastern time, with local and/or late-night programming (including Fox affiliates during the 10 p.m. ET/PT hour) by affiliates after game completion.

==Legend==
: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.
Other Legend
* Light blue indicates local programming.
* Gray indicates encore programming.
* Blue-gray indicates news programming.
* Light green indicates sporting events.
* Light Purple indicates movies. 
* Red indicates series being burned off and other scheduled programs, including specials.

<text>Hubbard Foods Ltd is a manufacturer of breakfast cereals based in Auckland, New Zealand. It operates under the Hubbard brand as well as producing for private labels. Hubbard Foods Ltd was founded by Dick Hubbard, who temporarily stepped down as CEO from 2004 to 2007 to serve as the mayor of Auckland.

As reported by &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot; in July 2010. The company is noted as the third significant player in the New Zealand &#x27;ready-to-eat&#x27; cereal market, following Sanitarium and Kellogg&#x27;s. Currently employs approximately 150 people.

==History==
Established in 1989 as Winner Foods, the company underwent a name change after two years, with the founder opting to use the family name on cereal boxes and renaming it Hubbard Foods Ltd. In 2008, there was contemplation of selling the company, but the decision was made to retain ownership.

In 2010, a notable initiative took place as Hubbard Foods, in collaboration with Vector Limited, installed the largest commercial thin-film solar PV panel system in New Zealand on the roof of its South Auckland building.

Subsequently, in 2018, the company transitioned ownership to HFG Group, later rebranded as Walter &amp; Wild under the ownership of Harry Hart and his father Graeme Hart.

<doc id="893902" wikidata="Q2453076" url="?curid=893902" title="Astronaut (Duran Duran album)">
<text>Astronaut is the eleventh studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 28 September 2004 by Epic Records. It was Duran Duran&#x27;s first studio album since &quot;Pop Trash&quot; (2000), and the first (and to date, last) full album since &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; (1983) to be recorded by the most famous five-member lineup of the band (the stand-alone 1985 single &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; was their last studio recording together).

&quot;Astronaut&quot; received mixed reviews from critics but was nevertheless a commercial success, peaking at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart to become the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the UK since &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; in 1983. The album also peaked at 17 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached the top ten in six other countries.

In 2021, the band signed a deal for the album with BMG (along with &quot;Medazzaland&quot;, &quot;Pop Trash&quot; and &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot;) which saw it being re-issued in the UK on various digital platforms.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Astronaut&quot; was met with &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 52 based on 17 reviews.

Upon its release, the album was well received by &quot;Billboard&quot;, stating that &quot;Duran Duran has a new lease on life, sounding more vibrant and exciting than it has in eons&quot;. Sarah Pratt in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also positively reviewed the album, describing it as &quot;feel-good pop&quot;. Doug Brod in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found &quot;Glistening zero-gravity synth-funk that&#x27;s mostly unembarrassing and at times shockingly vital&quot;, while reviews in &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; were largely negative. Dorian Lynskey in the latter publication finding &quot;Duran Duran are adrift in an unforgiving sea of disco-dad dance-pop, anaemic vocals and lyrics too distressingly awful to repeat in a family newspaper.&quot; Matt Dentler of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; called the album an &quot;overproduced synth shuffle&quot;, going on to say &quot;With too many songs trying too hard, Duranies will still go hungry for quality.&quot;

In a review for AllMusic, Andy Kellman wrote: &quot;Even with a handful of forgettable songs beyond that, the album is easily the best one credited to the Duran Duran name since 1993&#x27;s &quot;Wedding Album&quot;.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Astronaut&quot; debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and at number 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with similar top-20 debuts elsewhere in the world. Meanwhile, the CD/DVD set debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Music Video chart. The album peaked at number 29 in Japan.
The first single, &quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot;, was released in the US on 30 August 2004 and in the UK on 4 October 2004. It debuted at number five on the UK Singles Chart. In late November, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart.

The second single, &quot;What Happens Tomorrow&quot;, was released on 18 January 2005 in the US and on 31 January 2005 in the UK.

&quot;Astronaut&quot; has been certified &quot;Gold&quot; in the UK for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was certified Gold in Italy. As of 2008, it had sold around 260,000 copies in the US.

<doc id="893905" wikidata="Q7438710" url="?curid=893905" title="Scramble band">
<text>A scramble band – also known as a scatter band – is a particular type of field-performing marching band with distinct characteristics that set it apart from other common forms of marching bands; most notably, scramble bands do not normally march. In fact, the name comes from the way in which the band moves between formations – members run to each form without using a predescribed path; this is known as &quot;scrambling&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Scramble bands often take pride in their diversion from the normal marching band. In fact, most scramble bands &quot;do not march&quot; at all, regardless of whether their official group name contains a form of the word &quot;March&quot;.

Like their marching counterparts, scramble bands almost always perform music using traditional band instruments. They will also stand in formations on a field, but that is usually where the similarity between scramble bands and typical marching bands end. The formations themselves are often simple shapes or crude &quot;pictures&quot; that lend themselves to a particular section of the performance instead of intricate geometric or abstract shapes. Additionally, scramble band performances often rely on a humorous or satirical script, read during the performance by an announcer using a loudspeaker or public address system.

Scramble bands are generally student-run and tend to be smaller in membership than what one would expect from a marching band.

According to the self-described &quot;Cleverest Band in the World&quot; at Columbia University, the origin of scramble bands is as follows:

:&quot;See, in the 50s, our great country was going through a lot of changes. Disco was at its peak, little Shirley Temple was charming the hearts of Americans everywhere, Jesus was walking the earth, and Ronald Reagan was pushing hard for the new Women&#x27;s suffrage movement. The Columbia University Marching Band, which had always been slightly wacky, took a good look at itself. &quot;How,&quot; we asked ourselves, &quot;could we make being in a marching band even more fun?&quot; Well, we decided that the whole marching around and forming rhombi thing had gone out of style with World War II. So we introduced the world to the &quot;scramble band&quot; concept - so named for the way bandies would scramble from one interesting formation to the next.&quot;

However, there is no widespread agreement as to which school actually invented the scramble band concept. The Harvard University Band lays a significant claim to the title with proof of scrambling as early as The Game (Harvard-Yale), November 23, 1946, as well as spelling &quot;Keep &#x27;em Flying&quot; for the Navy and forming an airplane with the drum major twirling his baton as the propeller in 1941. With Guy Slade as director, baton twirler, and drill master, 74 letters were spelled during the 1930 football season, 29 at the Harvard-Yale game alone. The word &quot;Welcome&quot; was learned and formed in five minutes at a stadium game with Michigan.

Other characteristics of scramble bands vary by the particular group and may include:
* Non-standard instrumentation - Some bands include string or electronic sections to offer membership to musicians who would otherwise be excluded from participation in a marching band. Instruments in this category might include violins, cellos, string bass, electronic keyboards, and electric guitar. More unusual instrumentation such as bagpipes and accordions is not unheard of. For example, the Princeton University Band included an accordion, a bagpipe, two violins (acoustic), an electric guitar, and an electric bass in the 2005-06 school year, and has also featured a set of plastic flamingos and a pair of plastic pumpkins. The Michigan Technological University Huskies Pep Band contains instruments not normally seen in a pep band setting such as violins, violas, oboes, and bassoons, and unusual instruments such as piccolo trumpets, a valve trombone, a soprano trombone, bagpipes, contra-alto clarinet and a oven. The Brown University Band is known to make extensive use of melodicas and kazoos in their shows. The Columbia University Marching Band includes a six foot bench stolen from the University of Pennsylvania stands.
* Non-musicians - Just as membership often includes non-standard instrumentalists, it may also include people who have little or no musical talent at all. These members may &quot;play&quot; homemade instruments (washboards, trash can lids, mailboxes, toasters, an oven, etc.) or may participate in other various capacities. They are usually known as &quot;miscies,&quot; while at Princeton they are known as &quot;garbussion,&quot; a portmanteau of &quot;garbage&quot; and &quot;percussion.&quot; More skilled bands can have people with high levels of musical talent playing unusual instruments. The Stanford Band, for example, has &quot;mugs&quot; with sometimes up to a decade of musical education playing instruments such as a kitchen sink or satellite dish.
* Skits or other dramatic performance - Members may dress in costume and/or employ the use of props (usually handmade) to mime to the audience a scene described or suggested by the announcer&#x27;s script. Such scenes are often overdramatic (to aid audience members seated far away) and make use of slap-stick comedy, where appropriate (or not). Members of the Yale Precision Marching Band who act on the field are called &quot;squids.&quot;

==Particular ensembles==
This style is practiced mainly by a number of college marching bands, primarily in academically elite or liberal arts schools such as the Ivy League colleges (excepting Cornell University; the Cornell Big Red Marching Band performs in the corps style seen in more traditional bands); Rice University Marching Owl Band (known by its acronym, The MOB); Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band; Villanova; William &amp; Mary; Humboldt State Marching Lumberjacks; and DePauw University.

The Brown University Band has performed on ice skates at Brown Hockey games since 1970 and claims to be the world’s best (and, actually, only) ice skating scatter band. It is noteworthy to mention that many members are novice skaters, and that most have no previous experience skating while playing an instrument.

Besides school scatter bands, there are other traditional arenas for similar comic treatments of outdoor marching music, such as mummers parades, the pre-Rose Parade parody known as The Doo Dah Parade, Chinatown parades, Mardi Gras parades, etc.

==Stunts, antics, and tomfoolery==
Scramble bands are notorious for their irreverent stunts, and some of these prove to be controversial. The most upsetting events usually have consequences (see also: censorship) regardless of whether the band intended such controversy. Listed below are some of the more notable events in scramble band lore:
* The Princeton University Band was attacked by a group of cadets at The Citadel prior to a football game on September 20, 2008, while marching around the campus. Several Citadel officials apologized for the altercation, including The Citadel&#x27;s President Lt. Gen. John W. Rosa and the student body president; no action was taken by either school against the Band. (The incident ultimately did not prevent The Citadel from visiting Princeton for a football game in September 2009; that game went on without incident from either side.)
* Columbia&#x27;s altar-boy joke (tuition going down faster than...) at halftime of a football game against Fordham, a nearby Catholic school.
* UVA&#x27;s Inbred Family Feud gag against West Virginia. This was one of the events which ultimately led to the athletic department barring the band from attending all revenue sports in 2003.
* The Stanford Band accidentally rushed the field during the Big Game against rival Cal, mistakenly believing the game was over. This memorable accident became known as The Play, and is often seen on highlight reels. The field invasion prompted Cal announcer Joe Starkey to famously shout, &quot;The band is on the field!&quot;
* More recently, Stanford&#x27;s band was disciplined for a show with jokes about polygamy during a game against Brigham Young University in September 2004.
* The Rice University MOB (Marching Owl Band) launched a weather balloon-based &quot;UFO&quot;, eventually tracked by bewildered air traffic controllers.
* Yale was banned from West Point because of the nature of the script to be performed that day. The YPMB responded the following year at Yale, with a halftime show where band members sarcastically announced, &quot;We are all Americans and we are all the same.&quot;
* Another Yale halftime featured the marriage of two former band members. (&quot;At Yale, Wedding Band Takes On a New Meaning&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot;, October 10, 1992.)
* Dartmouth was banned from Holy Cross for a show that involved a Ted Kennedy Triathlon which included the &quot;Ted Kennedy drive and swim,&quot; a parody of the Chappaquiddick affair. Members of the Kennedy family were in attendance, and needless to say, were not pleased. The Dartmouth Band was allowed back for the first time in 2004, but did not attend due to a limited travel budget.
* The Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad , made up of engineering students at the University of Toronto, attended the Bloor-Danforth subway opening on February 26, 1966, and &quot;leapt over turnstiles&quot;, with 400 students piling onto a train. One student then pulled the emergency power switch, interfering with regular service for more than 5 hours on the first day of the subway line&#x27;s operation.
* Michigan Technological University&#x27;s Huskies Pep Band is banned from playing at rival school Northern Michigan University&#x27;s campus, allegedly due to taking away home field advantage. The Huskies Pep Band is one of the largest student organizations at the university, with more than 100 students on its active roster. During a 2004 Grand Valley State-Michigan Tech football game at Ann Arbor&#x27;s Big House, the band performed a Monty Python halftime show, where they played a rendition of &quot;Every Sperm is Sacred&quot; while forming an egg that was then fertilized by a sousaphonist sperm.

Occasionally, the tables are turned. The Texas A &amp; M Aggies misinterpreted a 1973 performance of Rice&#x27;s Marching Owl Band and formed an angry mob outside Rice&#x27;s own stadium, trapping the Owl band inside for hours until police dispersed some of the crowd and allowed the band to exit, transported by food service trucks.

==Censorship==
In recent years, administrators at many schools have taken steps to rein in their scramble bands&#x27; more embarrassing attempts at humor. These have included:
* Requiring approval of show content
* Replacing student leaders with university faculty or staff
* Refusing to allow the band to perform (a step occasionally also taken by a host school during away games)
* Change the style of band, like how Cornell is the only Ivy League school with a corps-style band.
* Dissolution of the band, like how Columbia’s band was dissolved in 2020.

<doc id="893924" wikidata="Q674586" url="?curid=893924" title="Johnny Mnemonic">
<text>&quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; is a Cyberpunk short story by American-Canadian writer William Gibson. It first appeared in &quot;Omni&quot; magazine in May 1981, and was subsequently included in &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, a 1986 collection of Gibson&#x27;s short fiction. It takes place in the world of Gibson&#x27;s cyberpunk novels, predating them by some years, and introduces the character Molly Millions, who plays a prominent role in the Sprawl trilogy of novels.

The short story served as the basis for the 1995 film &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, whose plot uses the same basic premise but otherwise differs considerably. A novelization of Gibson&#x27;s screenplay written by Terry Bisson was published in 1995. In 1996, a film tie-in edition of Gibson&#x27;s original short story was published as a standalone book.

==Plot summary==
Johnny is a data trafficker who has undergone cybernetic surgery to have a data storage system implanted in his head. The system allows him to store digital data too sensitive to risk transmission on computer networks. To keep the cargo secure, the data is locked by a password known only to the intended recipient. 

Johnny enters a trance-like state while the data is being transferred or the password is being set, making him unaware of the contents and unable to retrieve them. He makes a modest living in the Sprawl by physically transporting sensitive information for corporations, underworld crime rings or wealthy individuals.

As the story opens, Johnny has arranged to meet with his most recent customer, Ralfi Face, at the Drome bar. Ralfi is overdue to retrieve the hundreds of megabytes of data he has stored in Johnny&#x27;s head. To add to his troubles, Johnny has learned that Ralfi has placed a contract on him, although the reasons are unclear. 

Johnny finds Ralfi at his usual table, accompanied by his bodyguard Lewis. Johnny threatens them with a sawed-off shotgun in his bag, but Lewis incapacitates him with a neural disruption device hidden under the table. Ralfi reveals that the data was stolen from the yakuza, who are very interested in ensuring it is not revealed, and that he had not been aware of the theft when he hired Johnny.

Johnny is rescued by Molly, a &quot;razorgirl&quot; who has undergone extensive body modifications, most notably razor-sharp blades under her fingernails. She joins the three men at their table, looking for a job. When Lewis tries to attack her, she cuts his wrist tendons and takes the incapacitating control device from him. 

Ralfi offers to pay her off, but she deactivates the device and frees Johnny, who immediately offers a higher bid to hire her as a bodyguard. Johnny and Molly take Ralfi as they exit the bar, but a yakuza assassin waiting outside cuts Ralfi to pieces with a monomolecular wire hidden in a prosthetic thumb. Johnny fires his shotgun at the assassin but misses due to the man&#x27;s enhanced reflexes. Molly is delighted to be facing another professional.

Johnny decides that the only way to save himself from the same fate as Ralfi is to get the data out of his head, which can be done only by using a SQUID to retrieve the password. Molly takes him to an amusement park to meet Jones, a cybernetically enhanced dolphin retired from Navy service. Jones&#x27; previous assignment was to locate and hack into enemy mines using the SQUID and other sensors implanted in his skull. 

Since he is now addicted to heroin, the result of the Navy&#x27;s efforts to keep its dolphins loyal, Molly trades him a batch in exchange for finding the password. Johnny then has Molly read it out so he can enter his retrieval trance, with recorders capturing all the data. They upload a snippet to a yakuza communications satellite and threaten to release the rest unless Johnny is left alone.

To deal with the yakuza assassin who is still following them, Molly leads Johnny to the Lo Teks, a group of anti-technology outcasts who live in a suspended hideout near the top of the geodesic domes covering the Sprawl. At Molly&#x27;s request, the Lo Teks allow the assassin to climb up so she can face him on the &quot;Killing Floor,&quot; a sprung-floor arena wired to synthesizers and amplifiers. Molly dances around the assassin, causing discordant noise to blare from the sound system, and tricks him into slicing off his own hand with his thumb wire. Overwhelmed by the noise and the strange environment, he jumps through a hole in the floor and falls to his death.

The story closes nearly a year later, with Johnny now living among the Lo Teks. He and Molly have gone into business for themselves, using Jones&#x27; SQUID to retrieve traces of all the data he has ever carried and blackmailing former clients with it.

==Later mention==

In Gibson&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, the first of the Sprawl trilogy, Molly relates the rest of Johnny&#x27;s story to the protagonist, Case. Molly claims that after achieving success, Johnny was murdered by a vat-grown yakuza ninja.

<doc id="893925" wikidata="Q2018175" url="?curid=893925" title="Wicked Bible">
<text>The Wicked Bible, sometimes called the Adulterous Bible or the Sinners&#x27; Bible, is an edition of the Bible published in 1631 by Robert Barker and Martin Lucas, the royal printers in London, meant to be a reprint of the King James Bible. The name is derived from a mistake made by the compositors: in the Ten Commandments in , the word &quot;not&quot; was omitted from the sentence, &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot;.

== Errors ==

The Wicked Bible is best known for the omission of the word &quot;not&quot; in the sentence &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot; (), thus changing the sentence into &quot;Thou shalt commit adultery&quot;.

The 1886 &quot;Reports of Cases in the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission&quot; (which gives the Bodleian Library manuscript Rawlinson A 128 as its source) lists this as one of the &quot;two grossest errors&quot;, among &quot;divers other faults&quot;. The other is a misprint appearing in Deuteronomy 5: the word &quot;greatness&quot; appearing as &quot;great-asse&quot;, leading to a sentence reading: &quot;Behold, the our God hath shewed us his glory and his great-asse&quot;. Gordon Campbell reports that there are no surviving copies of the book that contain the second error (&quot;great-asse&quot;), but that in three of the surviving copies there is an inkblot where the missing &quot;n&quot; would be, suggesting such a mistake may have been covered up in these copies. He also notes that, at the time of the Wicked Bible&#x27;s publication, the word &quot;asse&quot; only had the sense of &quot;donkey&quot;. Rob Ainsley of the British Library, in a 2009 letter to the London Review of Books, suggested that the existence of this second error was highly dubious.

Diana Severance, director of the Dunham Bible Museum at the Houston Baptist University, and Gordon Campbell have suggested that the potential second error could indicate that someone (possibly a rival printer) purposely sabotaged the printing of the Wicked Bible so that Robert Barker and Martin Lucas would lose their exclusive license to print the Bible. However, Campbell also notes that neither Barker nor Lucas suggested the possibility of sabotage in their defence when they were arraigned.

About a year after publication, Barker and Lucas were called to the Star Chamber and fined and deprived of their printing license.

The Wicked Bible is the most prominent example of the bible errata which often have absent negatives that completely reverse the scriptural meaning.

== Public reaction ==
The case of the Wicked Bible was commented on by Peter Heylyn in 1668:

 The &quot;... £300 fine ... was eventually quashed ... [but] most of the texts were destroyed.&quot;

The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot expressed anger at both errors.

== Origin of the name ==
The nickname Wicked Bible seems to have first been applied in 1855 by rare book dealer Henry Stevens. As he relates in his memoir of James Lenox, after buying what was then the only known copy of the 1631 octavo Bible for fifty guineas, &quot;on June 21, I exhibited the volume at a full meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London, at the same time nicknaming it &#x27;The Wicked Bible,&#x27; a name that has stuck to it ever since.&quot;

== Remaining copies ==
The majority of the Wicked Bible&#x27;s copies were immediately cancelled and destroyed, and the number of extant copies remaining today, which are considered highly valuable by collectors, is thought to be relatively low. One copy is in the collection of rare books in the New York Public Library and is very rarely made accessible; another can be seen in the Dunham Bible Museum in Houston, Texas. 

The British Library in London had a copy of the Wicked Bible on display, opened to the misprinted commandment, in a free exhibition until September 2009.

There are fifteen known copies of the Wicked Bible today in the collections of museums and libraries in the British Isles, North America and Australasia:

A number of copies also exist in private collections. In 2008, a copy of the Wicked Bible went up for sale online, priced at $89,500. A second copy was put up for sale from the same website which was priced at $99,500 as of 2015.

In 2014, William Scheide donated his library of rare books and manuscripts to Princeton University, with a copy of the Wicked Bible among its holdings.

In 2015, one of the remaining Bible copies was put on auction by Bonhams, and sold for £31,250 (equivalent to today).

In 2016, a copy of the Wicked Bible was put on auction by Sotheby&#x27;s and sold for $46,500. In 2018, the same copy of the Wicked Bible was put on auction again by Sotheby&#x27;s, and sold for $56,250.

<text>This is a list of [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[regiment]]s. Most formations have changed names several times during their existence. Listed here are commonly used names.

Regiments were the highest organized organic units in the Swedish Army from the time of Gustavus Adolphus on to the Second World War. In 1949, the Swedish Army was reorganised, with the regiments being used as training units for conscripts during peacetime. The new main fighting unit was the brigade, only organised in wartime (with a few exceptions). The division (&quot;fördelning&quot;) is not a static organization, but can have brigades assigned and removed when needed, similar to other countries&#x27; corps formations.

Regiments are most commonly used in the context of the Swedish Army with the exception of the coastal artillery and naval infantry which belongs to the Swedish Navy.

== Grand regiments ==

&quot;Storregementen&quot; or &quot;landsregementen&quot; (regiments of the land), these regiments were organized by Gustavus Adolphus in the end of the 1610s from the smaller units &quot;fänika&quot; and &quot;fana&quot; raised in the various parts of Sweden during the time of Gustav Vasa:

* &quot;Norrlands storregemente&quot; (Norrland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Upplands storregemente&quot; (Uppland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Södermanlands storregemente&quot; (Södermanland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Östergötlands storregemente&quot; (Östergötland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Västergötlands storregemente&quot; (Västergötland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Smålands storregemente&quot; (Småland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Finlands storregemente&quot; (Österbotten Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Karelska storregementet&quot; (Karelian Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Västra Finlands storregemente&quot; (Western Finland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Mellersta Finlands storregemente&quot; (Middle Finland Grand Regiment)
* &quot;Östra Finlands storregementet&quot; (Eastern Finland Grand Regiment)

== Historical regiments ==

The original provincial regiments (&quot;landskapsregementen&quot;) were raised by splitting the old grand regiments, forming 20 infantry (actually 21 as &quot;Smålands regemente&quot; was split into &quot;Kronobergs&quot; and &quot;Jönköpings regemente&quot;) and eight cavalry regiments as written in the Swedish constitution of 1634. As time went on, new regiments were raised by conscription, created by splitting old regiments or enlisting soldiers from various dominions of Sweden. There were also times when temporary regiments were raised; these regiments were called &quot;männingsregementen&quot;.
