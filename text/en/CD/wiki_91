<text>Tiaina Baul &quot;Junior&quot; Seau Jr. (; ; January 19, 1969 – May 2, 2012) was an American professional football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 20 seasons, mostly with the San Diego Chargers. Known for his passionate play, he was a six-time first-team All-Pro, twelve-time Pro Bowl selection, and named to the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team. He was elected posthumously to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

Originally from San Diego, California, Seau played college football for the USC Trojans, earning All-American honors in 1989. He was selected by the Chargers with the fifth overall pick of the 1990 NFL draft. Seau played for the Chargers for 13 seasons and led them to Super Bowl XXIX before being traded to the Miami Dolphins where he spent three years, and spent his last four seasons with the New England Patriots. After his retirement, his No. 55 was retired by the Chargers and he was inducted into their Hall of Fame.

Seau committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest in 2012 at age 43. Later studies by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that Seau had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease that has also been found in other deceased former NFL players. It is believed to be caused by repetitive head trauma, and can lead to conditions such as dementia, rage, and depression.

==Early life==
Seau was born on January 19, 1969, in San Diego, California, the fifth child of Tiaina Seau Sr. and Luisa Mauga Seau of Aunu&#x27;u, American Samoa. Tiaina Sr.&#x27;s grandfather was a village chief in Pago Pago. Tiaina Sr. worked at a rubber factory and was a school custodian, and Luisa worked at the commissary of Camp Pendleton in Southern California and a laundromat. After Seau was born, the family moved back to American Samoa for several years before returning to San Diego; Seau did not learn to speak English until he was seven years old. At home, Seau and his three brothers had to sleep in the family&#x27;s one-car garage.

Seau attended Oceanside High School in Oceanside, where he lettered in football, basketball, and track and field. As a football player, Seau was a starter at linebacker and tight end, and as a senior, he was named the Avocado League offensive MVP and led the 18-member Oceanside Pirates team to the San Diego 2A championship. &quot;Parade&quot; selected Seau to its high school All-American team.

In basketball, as a senior, he was named the California Interscholastic Federation San Diego Section Player of the Year. He helped his team win the 1987 Lt. James Mitchell Tournament and make third place in the Mt. Carmel Invitational. In track and field, he was the Avocado League champion in the shot put. Seau was also named to California&#x27;s all-academic team with a 3.6 grade-point average.

==College career==
After graduating from high school, Seau attended the University of Southern California (USC). He had to sit out from football in his freshman season due to his 690 SAT score on the college entrance exam, which was 10 points short of USC&#x27;s minimum score for freshman eligibility.

Seau told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;: &quot;I was labeled a dumb jock. I went from being a four-sport star to an ordinary student at USC. I found out who my true friends were. Nobody stuck up for me—not our relatives, best friends or neighbors. There&#x27;s a lot of jealousy among Samoans, not wanting others to get ahead in life, and my parents got an earful at church: &#x27;We told you he was never going to make it.&#x27;&quot; This prompted him to apologize to his coaches, teachers, and principal at Oceanside High.

Seau lettered in his final two seasons with the USC Trojans, 1988 and 1989, posting 19 sacks in 1989 en route to a unanimous first-team All-American selection.

==Professional career==
===San Diego Chargers===

After three years as a Trojan, Seau entered the NFL draft after his junior season and was chosen in the first round of the 1990 NFL draft by Bobby Beathard&#x27;s San Diego Chargers as the fifth overall draft pick. Seau quickly became one of the most popular players on the Chargers, receiving the nickname &quot;Tasmanian Devil&quot;, after the wild antics of the cartoon character. He became the face of the Chargers franchise and a San Diego sports icon.

Seau started 15 of the 16 games he played in during his rookie season, and was named an alternate to the 1991 Pro Bowl after recording 85 tackles. In 1991, he picked up 129 tackles and seven sacks and was named to the 1992 Pro Bowl, the first of 12 consecutive Pro Bowls for Seau. In 1992, he was awarded the George Halas Trophy by the Newspaper Enterprise Association as the NFL&#x27;s top defensive player, NFL Defensive Player of the Year by &quot;Football Digest&quot;, AFC Defensive Player of the Year by United Press International, and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) AFC Linebacker of the Year. He also won the NFLPA award in 1993 and 1994.

He started no fewer than 13 games for the Chargers over each of the ensuing 11 seasons, registering a career high with 155 tackles in 1994, when he led his team to a championship appearance in Super Bowl XXIX. In one of the greatest games in his career, he recorded 16 tackles in the 1994 AFC Championship Game while playing with a pinched nerve in his neck in a 17–13 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Despite San Diego&#x27;s 1–15 record in 2000, the NFL Alumni Association named him their Linebacker of the Year. In 2002, his final year with the Chargers, he logged a then-career low 83 tackles and missed his final Pro Bowl due to an ankle injury.

===Miami Dolphins===
On April 16, 2003, Seau was traded to the Miami Dolphins for a conditional draft choice. He started 15 games that season for the 10-6 Dolphins and was one of their standout defensive players. However, in 2004, a torn pectoral muscle limited Seau to eight games, 68 tackles, and one sack. He started five of the first seven games he played in with the Dolphins in 2005, but was placed on injured reserve on November 24 with an achilles tendon injury. On March 6, 2006, Seau was released by the Dolphins.

===New England Patriots===
Seau announced his retirement at an emotional press conference on August 14, 2006. He called it his &quot;graduation&quot; because he was not going to stop working. He contended that he was merely moving on to the next phase of his life.
Seau returned to football just four days later, signing with the New England Patriots. He started 10 of the first 11 games for the Patriots, recording 69 tackles before breaking his right arm while making a tackle in a game against the Chicago Bears. He was placed on injured reserve on November 27.

On May 21, 2007, Seau re-signed with the Patriots for the 2007 season. In September 2007, Seau was named one of the Patriots&#x27; seven captains. He was a prominent contributor to the Patriots undefeated regular season that year. He started four of the 16 games he played in for the Patriots in 2007, and then started the Patriots&#x27; two playoff games before Super Bowl XLII against the New York Giants. New England&#x27;s undefeated streak ended with a Super Bowl loss to the Giants.

After the Patriots had a number of injuries late in the 2008 season, they re-signed Seau. He started two of four games he played. On December 22, 2008, a fan was arrested for trespassing, assault, and battery for tackling Seau as he stood on the New England sideline during a home game against the Arizona Cardinals. Seau stated that he did not feel threatened by the fan; he thought that the fan was happy and excited and got carried away.

On October 7, 2009, NFL Network reported that the Patriots had an &quot;agreement in principle&quot; with Seau for a fourth one-year deal; Seau took physicals and worked out with the team. He officially signed on October 13. He was active for 7 games for the Patriots in 2009, recording 14 tackles as a reserve linebacker.

===Retirement===
Seau announced his intention to retire permanently on the television program &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; on January 13, 2010.

==NFL career statistics==
==Beyond football==
His restaurant at Westfield Mission Valley in Mission Valley, California—Seau&#x27;s The Restaurant, which opened in 1996—was his most successful business venture. Seau also had a clothing line, Say Ow Gear. The restaurant was closed on May 16, 2012, just two weeks after his death; the trustees of his estate explained that &quot;Without Seau&#x27;s charismatic leadership, it was felt that the future profitability of the restaurant could be in question.&quot;

&quot;Sports Jobs with Junior Seau&quot; premiered on December 2, 2009, on Versus. The show followed Seau as he did the jobs that make sports work. Ten episodes aired through January 27, 2010.

Seau was actively involved with community work through Samoan &quot;sister city&quot; projects within San Diego County.

===Junior Seau Foundation===

In 1992, Seau created the Junior Seau Foundation with the mission to educate and empower young people through the support of child abuse prevention, drug and alcohol awareness, recreational opportunities, anti-juvenile delinquency efforts and complementary educational programs.

The 20th Anniversary Junior Seau Celebrity Golf Classic was held March 10–12, 2012, at the La Costa Resort and Spa.

The Foundation gave out an annual award to the individual who exemplifies the mission statement of the Junior Seau Foundation.

==Personal life==
In 1989, Seau&#x27;s older son, Tyler, was born to Seau&#x27;s high school sweetheart, Melissa Waldrop. Seau broke up with Waldrop when Tyler was 13 months old. He married Gina Deboer in 1991. The couple had three children together, a daughter and two sons, before divorcing in 2002. Seau&#x27;s son Jake attended Duke University where he played lacrosse. In 2019, Jake signed with the Dallas Rattlers of Major League Lacrosse.

Seau sustained minor injuries in October 2010 when his SUV plunged down a 100-foot cliff in Carlsbad, California, only hours after he was arrested for domestic violence following an incident reported to the police by his girlfriend at their home in nearby Oceanside. Seau stated that he fell asleep at the wheel, and was never charged in the domestic incident.

Seau&#x27;s nephew, Ian Seau, was also a football player. Another nephew, Micah Seau, played football at San Diego State. His cousin was Pulu Poumele.

==Death==

On May 2, 2012, Seau was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest at his home in Oceanside. Authorities ruled his death a suicide. He left no suicide note, but did leave a piece of paper in the kitchen of his home with lyrics he scribbled from his favorite country song, &quot;Who I Ain&#x27;t.&quot; The song, co-written by his friend Jamie Paulin, describes a man who regrets the person he has become.

Seau&#x27;s death recalled the 2011 suicide of former NFL player Dave Duerson, who shot himself in the chest and left a suicide note requesting that his brain be studied for brain trauma. Seau had no prior reported history of concussions, but his ex-wife said he did sustain concussions during his career. &quot;He always bounced back and kept on playing,&quot; Gina Seau said. &quot;He&#x27;s a warrior. That didn&#x27;t stop him.&quot; Seau had insomnia for at least the last seven years of his life, and he was taking zolpidem (Ambien), a prescription drug commonly prescribed for sleep disorders.

Seau&#x27;s autopsy report released later in August 2012 by the San Diego County medical examiner indicated that his body contained no illegal drugs or alcohol, but did show traces of zolpidem. No apparent signs of brain damage were found, nor was he determined to have exhibited mood changes and irritability often apparent with concussions and brain damage.

There was speculation that Seau suffered brain damage due to CTE, a condition traced to concussion-related brain damage with depression as a symptom, as dozens of deceased former NFL players were found to have CTE. Seau&#x27;s family donated his brain tissue to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the NIH; other candidates included the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy and the Brain Injury Research Institute. Citing the Seau family&#x27;s right to privacy, NIH did not intend to release the findings.

On January 10, 2013, Seau&#x27;s family released the NIH&#x27;s findings that his brain showed definitive signs of CTE. Russell Lonser of the NIH coordinated with three independent neuropathologists, giving them unidentified tissue from three brains including Seau&#x27;s. The three experts along with two government researchers arrived at the same conclusion. The NIH said the findings on Seau were similar to autopsies of people &quot;with exposure to repetitive head injuries.&quot;

On January 23, 2013, Seau&#x27;s family sued the NFL over the brain injuries he had over his career. In 2014, his family continued to pursue the lawsuit while opting out of the NFL concussion lawsuit&#x27;s proposed settlement, which was initially funded with $765 million. The family reached a confidential settlement with the league in 2018. The Seaus&#x27; attorney said that they were &quot;pleased&quot; with the resolution.

Seau is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated hits to the head.

==Legacy==

Seau was known for his passionate playing style, including a fist-pumping dance he performed after big plays. Rick Gosselin of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said Seau &quot;probably was the most dynamic player of his era&quot;. NFL head coach Norv Turner, who coached Seau as well as faced him as an opponent, said, &quot;The No. 1 thing about Junior was that he was such an explosive player he&#x27;d defeat one-on-one blocks and he was a great tackler.&quot;

Seau&#x27;s quickness allowed him to freelance, which sometimes put him out of position. &quot;People say he gambled a bit, but in reality, his insight led him to the ball ... Even when he was wrong, you had to account for him and that created problems for offensive coordinators. You&#x27;d better have somebody blocking him,&quot; said former NFL coach Tom Bass.

He was praised by teammates for his work ethic and leadership. He would play when hurt, and often refused to leave games. &quot;He played the game the way it was meant to be played,&quot; said retired Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway. Bill Belichick, his coach at New England, praised Seau&#x27;s leadership and willingness to accept any role.

He was named to the Chargers 40th and 50th anniversary teams, which honor the top players and coaches in the team&#x27;s history. He was inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame on November 27, 2011, as part of Alumni Day ceremonies at a sold-out game against the Denver Broncos at Qualcomm Stadium. Fellow Chargers Hall of Famer Dan Fouts introduced Seau before a crowd of nearly 71,000.
Chargers President Dean Spanos honored Seau after his death as &quot;...An icon in our community. He transcended the game. He wasn&#x27;t just a football player, he was so much more.&quot; The Chargers retired his No. 55 during his public memorial. The Junior Seau Pier Amphitheatre and Junior Seau Beach Community Center were renamed posthumously in his honor by the city of Oceanside in July 2012.

On September 1, 2012, during the University of Southern California&#x27;s home opener, Seau was honored by the team. On September 16, 2012, the Chargers retired Seau&#x27;s number 55 during a ceremony at the 2012 regular season home opener against the Tennessee Titans. The San Diego Hall of Champions inducted Seau into the Breitbard Hall of Fame on February 25, 2013, forgoing their normal two-year waiting period after an athlete&#x27;s retirement or death.

Seau became eligible for election into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015. His eligibility was not accelerated due to his death from the standard five-year waiting period after a player&#x27;s retirement. On January 31, 2015, Seau was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He wanted his daughter, Sydney, to introduce him if he were ever to be inducted. However, the Hall of Fame cited a five-year policy of not allowing speeches for deceased inductees, denying Sydney the opportunity to introduce her father.

Instead, she was allowed to speak onstage for three minutes uninterrupted on the NFL Network, and delivered a pared down version of her full speech, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; published. Seau is the first player of Polynesian and Samoan descent to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

On September 21, 2018, ESPN released &quot;Seau&quot;, a 30 for 30 documentary that highlighted Seau&#x27;s career, as well as the effects of his injuries on his life, his family, and his post-football endeavors.

On August 5th, 2023, Junior Seau&#x27;s linebacker teammate in Miami for three years, Zach Thomas, paid tribute to him at the end of his Pro Football Hall of Fame speech: &quot;But there&#x27;s one person whose name I&#x27;ve yet to mention. His poster hung on my wall in college, and he was everything I wanted to be as a football player. He was my inspiration, and he became my teammate and friend. Though he&#x27;s not here physically, he&#x27;s here in spirit and in a bust in that building behind me. I&#x27;m truly honored to join him. Junior Seau, love ya buddy.&quot;

<text>Richard Leo Gedman (born September 26, 1959) is an American professional baseball hitting adviser with the Boston Red Sox, and a former coach and player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the Red Sox (1980–1990), Houston Astros (1990–1991), and St. Louis Cardinals (1991–1992). Listed at and , he batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

==Baseball career==

=== Amateur and minor leagues ===
A native of Worcester, Massachusetts, Gedman played first base and pitched at Saint Peter-Marian High School and for the Grafton Hill (Worcester) American Legion Baseball program. He went undrafted in the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft, and was signed as a free agent by the Red Sox. He was sent to the Instructional League to learn to play catcher, and progressed steadily up through the Red Sox minor leagues system. Highlights of his minor league career included catching the first nine innings of the longest game in the history of professional baseball, a 33 inning affair between Gedman&#x27;s Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings.

=== Major leagues ===
Gedman made his debut for the Sox at the age of 20 in September 1980, pinch-hitting for Carl Yastrzemski. In 1981, regular Sox catcher Carlton Fisk was granted free-agency and signed with the Chicago White Sox, leaving the catcher position open. Gedman shared catching duties with Gary Allenson, and played well enough to be named The &quot;Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year.

Following a poor 1982, Gedman&#x27;s hitting improved the next two seasons under the instruction of Red Sox hitting coach Walt Hriniak. He hit a career high 24 home runs in 1984 and followed with career highs in batting average (.295) and RBI (80) in 1985 while throwing out nearly half of potential base stealers. In that season, he became the 16th Red Sox player and only the sixth catcher since 1900 to hit for the cycle.

In 1986, Gedman experienced three of the highlights of his career. Gedman was the battery-mate for Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens on April 29 when Clemens struck out 20 batters in a game against the Seattle Mariners to set the major league single-game strikeout record in a nine-inning game. Gedman&#x27;s 20 putouts during the game set the American League record for putouts by a catcher. On April 30, he had 16 putouts for a total of 36 in two days, which is the most for a catcher in two consecutive games. Gedman was also selected to the All-Star Game that year, to go with his appearance in the 1985 game. But the peak of his career coincided with one of its lows in the 1986 World Series. In the bottom of the tenth inning of Game 6, with the Sox leading by one run with two outs, Kevin Mitchell on third and Mookie Wilson at bat, reliever Bob Stanley threw a pitch that Gedman failed to handle. It was scored as a wild pitch, but many considered it a Gedman passed ball. Mitchell came in to score, tying the game. Then, Wilson hit a ball that went through first baseman Bill Buckner&#x27;s legs to win the game for the Mets. The Sox went on to lose the deciding game, and the series.

On January 8, 1987, ten free agents (Gedman, Tim Raines, Lance Parrish, Bob Horner, Andre Dawson, Ron Guidry, Bob Boone, Doyle Alexander, Toby Harrah and Gary Roenicke) failed to meet a midnight deadline and thus were not allowed to re-sign with their former clubs until May 1 if they were not offered contracts by new teams. The general lack of interest in the players became the focus of a Players Association anti-collusion lawsuit against the owners.

On November 3, 1986, while practicing for a seven-game series between Major League and Japanese All-Stars, Gedman was struck by a warmup pitch from Detroit Tigers pitcher Willie Hernández, resulting in a fractured cheekbone. This was the beginning of a litany of injuries, holdouts, and inconsistency which contributed to the waning of Gedman&#x27;s skills, both offensive and defensive. In 1989, Rick Cerone replaced him as the regular Boston catcher. In 1990, he served as back-up catcher to Tony Peña, who was acquired by the Red Sox during the offseason. On June 7, Gedman was traded to Houston for a player to be named later.

Gedman was not re-signed by the Astros, and in 1991 he signed with the Cardinals to back up Tom Pagnozzi. After spending spring training of 1993 with the Oakland Athletics, Gedman signed a minor-league contract with the Yankees, playing the season with their Triple-A club, the Columbus Clippers. When he failed to make a major league roster in 1994, he retired at age 34.

During his career, Gedman batted .252 with 88 home runs, 382 RBI, 331 runs, 176 doubles, 12 triples, and three stolen bases in 1033 games. As a catcher, he compiled a .984 fielding percentage with 5274 putouts, 431 assists and 92 errors in 980 games.

Gedman made the American League All-Star Team twice as a catcher in the 1980s, joining such players as Lance Parrish, Carlton Fisk, Ted Simmons, and Terry Steinbach as the only players to accomplish this.

=== Coaching ===
In 2002, Gedman became a coach with the North Shore Spirit, a team in the independent Northeast League. He was also the Spirit&#x27;s bench coach. He then managed the Worcester Tornadoes, in the Can-Am League, from 2005 through 2010. The Tornadoes won the Can-Am League title in their first year of existence. In his six years in Worcester, Gedman led the team to a 283–290 record, 10–6 in the postseason.

On January 10, 2011, Gedman returned to organized baseball when he was named hitting coach for the Lowell Spinners, the Red Sox&#x27; Class A Short Season affiliate in the New York–Penn League, returning to the Boston organization after a two-decade absence. In 2012, Gedman was promoted to Class A Salem, and switched to Double-A Portland Sea Dogs in 2013. In 2015, he was named hitting coach of the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, and moved with the team when they left Pawtucket for Worcester in 2021. He remained with the Worcester Red Sox as their hitting coach through the 2024 season.

In January 2025, the Red Sox named Gedman as a player development hitting adviser.

=== Highlights ===
* Twice named an All-Star (1985–86)
* The Sporting News&#x27; AL Rookie of the Year (1981)
* Selected for the All-Star team by UPI and The Sporting News (1985)
* Caught Dennis Eckersley&#x27;s one-hitter (September 26, 1980)
* Set two AL records for putouts in a game [20] and in consecutive games [36] (April 29–30, 1986)
* Hit for the cycle and drove in seven runs against the Blue Jays (September 18, 1985)
* Reached base in all five at-bats of historic Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series. This included a two-run home run in the second inning and a hit by pitch in the ninth inning that set up Dave Henderson&#x27;s dramatic two-out home run.

== Personal life ==
Rich Gedman met his future-wife Sherry Aselton in 1977, when both attended St. Peter-Marian High School in Worcester. Sherry went on to play softball and basketball at the University of Connecticut where she threw two no-hitters and as of 2011 still holds the second-lowest career ERA in program history (0.57). The couple married in 1982.

The Gedmans have two sons, Michael and Matthew, and a daughter, Marissa. Michael was a freshman pitcher for the Le Moyne College Dolphins in 2007, but when his younger brother Matthew was accepted as a freshman at UMass in both their baseball and hockey programs (as an infielder and a goalie), sophomore Michael transferred to UMass also. Mike played a mix of first baseman and pitcher, and hit .312 in three seasons for the Minutemen, including .345 as a junior in 2009. Matt played shortstop and third baseman at UMass, and finished his career with a .334 batting average over his four years, and a team-leading .402 average during his senior year in 2011. Matt was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 45th round of the 2011 MLB Draft; he played in Minor League Baseball for several Red Sox farm teams from 2011 through 2014.

Marissa Gedman attended Noble and Greenough School where she participated in field hockey, ice hockey, and softball. In her 2008 season, she achieved All-League ISL, a NE Championship, and 16-U National Championship in Ice Hockey. She went on to attend Harvard University starting in 2010, and played for the women&#x27;s ice hockey team, accumulating 75 points with the Harvard Crimson women&#x27;s ice hockey program. For the 2015–16 season, she was a member of the Boston Pride of the NWHL and participated in the 2016 Outdoor Women&#x27;s Classic, the first outdoor professional women’s hockey game.

In his spare time during the baseball off-season, Gedman holds catching clinics in central Massachusetts including at The Strike Zone in Worcester, Shrewsbury High School, and Triple Play Batting Cages in Clinton, Massachusetts.

<text>The area known as Croatia today has been inhabited throughout the prehistoric period, ever since the Stone Age, up to the Migrations Period and the arrival of the White Croats.

==Prehistory==

===Paleolithic===
The earliest traces of human presence on Croatian soil date back to the Paleolithic Age. In Šandalja Cave near Pula, and in Punikve near Ivanec, flints made by pre-Neanderthal people have been found, while the remains of Neanderthal prehistoric humans have been discovered on Hušnjakovo near Krapina. In the middle Paleolithic period, Neandertals lived in modern Zagorje, northern Croatia. Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger discovered bones and other remnants of a Neandertal, subsequently named &quot;Homo krapiniensis&quot;, on a hill near the town of Krapina. Palaeolithic site on Hušnjakovo near Krapina, counted among the largest and richest sites in the world where Neanderthal remains have been found. During excavations from 1899 to 1905, led by the palaeontologist and geologist Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger, abundant remains of Palaeolithic items and the bones of extinct prehistoric animals were discovered. The Krapina finds are estimated to be 130,000 years old. Archaeological finds from the Palaeolithic Age have been discovered in other places throughout Croatia (Vindija Cave, Veternica, etc.).
Vindija sediments are 12 m thick, divided in 13 layers designated from unit A (youngest) to unit M.

===Neolithic===
The Neolithic period (c. 6000 BC – c. 3000 BC) was characterised by the emergence of permanent, organised settlements, and by the production of earthenware and other items. In the Adriatic area, the most significant Neolithic cultures are the Impresso, Danilo and Hvar cultures, and, in the interior, the Sopot and Korenovo cultures, while the major sites where finds have been recovered are Smilčić near Zadar, Danilo near Šibenik, Markova and Grapčeva Caves on Hvar, and others. In the early Neolithic period, the Starčevo, Vinča and Sopot cultures were scattered between and around the Sava, the Drava and the Danube. Notable are the excavation sites of Ščitarjevo near Zagreb, Sopot near Vinkovci, Vučedol near Vukovar, Nakovanj on Pelješac. 

Smilčić, near Zadar, one of the richest Neolithic sites on open ground. The settlement was surrounded by a defence moat and the dwellings were huts built above ground from interwoven branches. It has been established that the settlement developed in two stages: the earlier stage, with finds from the Impresso culture, and the later stage, characterised by the Danilo culture. Among the finds, some ceramic, richly decorated cultic vessels with four feet (rhytons) stand out, as well as various vessels decorated with paintings and engravings.

===Bronze Age===
As the Stone Age moved into the Bronze Age, known as the Eneolithic or Chalcolithic period, in which the first metal – copper – began to be used, the Vučedol culture arose (c. 3000 BC – c. 2200 BC), named after the locality of Vučedol, on the bank of the Danube near Vukovar. Vučedol, near Vukovar, an important prehistoric site (‘The Troy of the Danube’), after which the Vučedol culture was named, and which embraced a wider cultural complex from the Carpathians to the eastern Alps and the Dinaric Alps. It is presumed to have emerged after the arrival of Indo-European settlers around 3,000 BC and lasted until about 2,000 BC. Its characteristics include new metalwork procedures, extremely skilled ceramics, and, according to some researchers, the people used a calendar marked on ceramic vessels.

In the Bronze Age (c. 2500 BC – c. 800 BC), a period of great ethnic strife and migration, metalwork and techniques for producing bronze items continued to develop. Several cultural groups can be singled out (the Gradina (hillfort)/Castellieri culture in Istria, the Urnfield culture in northern Croatia, the Cetina culture in Dalmatia, etc.), which arose through the symbiosis of earlier cultural traditions and the various influences of strong neighbouring cultures. 

===Iron Age===
The Iron Age left traces of the Hallstatt culture (proto-Illyrians) and the La Tène culture (proto-Celts). The arrival of the systematic production and use of iron tools marked the beginning of the Iron Age (c. 800 BC – early 1st century), during which the first ethnic communities appeared in the area which is present-day Croatia. Their names were recorded by Greek and Roman writers. They belonged to the Illyrian Histri, Iapodes, Liburnians, Delmatae, Ardiaei, etc., and came under the strong influence of Greek and Italic culture, and from the 4th century BC, under the influence of Celtic spiritual and material culture. 

Nesactium (Vizače), northeast of Pula, was a prominent centre for the Illyrian Histri in the first millennium BC. They continued to live there right up to late classical times, i.e. the early Christian era. In Nesactium, bronze pails decorated with figures, fragments of jewellery, weapons and ceramics have been found, along with examples of monumental stonework, representing the greatest achievements of prehistoric artistic creativity on Croatian soil. In the village of Prozor near Otočac, the remains of a settlement and necropolis belonging to the Illyrians Iapodes (first millennium BC) have been discovered. The people lived there during the Roman age. They had a high level of artistic craftwork, represented by bronze ornaments with specific shapes, such as ornaments for the head (circlets), pendants, links for belts, buckles, clasps, and so on, and their jewellery was distinct for its use of amber and glass paste.

==Illyria==

In recorded history, the area was inhabited by Illyrian tribes such as the Delmetae, who spoke an Illyrian language, an ancient branch of Indo-European. Other tribes such as the Liburni and Iapodes, whose ethnicity is less clear, inhabited various parts of the Adriatic coastline and interior between modern Istria and Herzegovina.

In the 4th century BC the northern parts of modern-day Croatia were also colonized by the Celts, the Scordisci tribe. Other Celtic peoples may also have been found elsewhere integrated among the Illyrians. The islands of Issa and Pharos as well as the locality of Tragurion became Greek colonies since the same period.

Illyria was independent of foreign rule until the Romans conquered it two centuries later, in 168 BC. The Romans organized the land into the Roman province of Illyricum which encompassed most of modern Croatia). Illyricum was subsequently split into the provinces of Pannonia and Dalmatia in year 10. Pannonia was further split in two by Trajan between 102 and 107.

A fourfold split of the same province followed at the turn of the 4th century under Diocletian — an emperor of Illyrian descent, from Dalmatia. Other notable people from these areas in this period included the Christian Jerome, Saint Marinus (builder of San Marino), emperors Valentinian I and Valens, and Pope John IV.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Roman roads and the Illyrian population speaking Romance languages (such as Istro-Romanian or Dalmatian) remained. With the increasing amount of human migration, this population entrenched in the cities along the whole Dalmatian coast.

The Lombards and the Huns made an incursion from the north. After 476 the area was subject to Odoacer and then to Ostrogoth rulers beginning with Theodoric the Great. Justinian claimed the old province of Dalmatia to the Eastern Roman Empire in 535. Forebears of Croatia&#x27;s current Slav population settled there in the 7th century following the Avars, reportedly under instructions from Byzantine emperor Heraclius.

<text>The Hossbach Memorandum is a summary of a meeting in Berlin on 5 November 1937 attended by German dictator Adolf Hitler and his military and foreign policy leadership in which Hitler outlined his expansionist policies. The meeting marked the beginning of Hitler&#x27;s foreign policies becoming radicalised.

According to the memorandum, Hitler did not want war with Britain and France in 1939. Instead, he favoured small wars of plunder to support Germany&#x27;s struggling economy. Hitler&#x27;s army adjutant, Colonel Friedrich Hossbach, took minutes at the meeting. Also in attendance were Reich Foreign Minister, Baron Konstantin von Neurath; Reich War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg; Army Commander-in-Chief, General Werner von Fritsch; &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Erich Raeder; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Commander-in-Chief, Hermann Göring.

==Contents==
The conference of 5 November 1937 had been called in response to complaints from Admiral Raeder that the navy was receiving insufficient allocations of steel and other raw materials and that its entire building programme was in danger of collapse. Neither the air force nor the army was willing to reduce its steel allocations. As the conference had been called in response to resolve the dispute, Hitler took the opportunity to provide a summary of his assessment of foreign policy.

He stated that if he died, the contents of the conference were to be regarded as his &quot;political testament&quot;. In Hitler&#x27;s view, the economy of Nazi Germany had reached such a state of crisis that the only way of stopping a drastic fall in living standards was to embark on a policy of aggression sooner, rather than later, to provide &quot;Lebensraum&quot; by seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia. Hitler also announced that it was imperative to act in the next five or six years before &quot;two hate-inspired antagonists&quot;, Britain and France, closed the gap in the arms race in which, Hitler noted, Germany was already falling behind.

A striking change noted in the Hossbach Memorandum is Hitler&#x27;s new evaluation of Britain: from a prospective ally in 1928 in the &quot;Zweites Buch&quot; to a &quot;hate-inspired antagonist&quot; in 1937 that was unwilling and unable to accept a strong Germany. The change was a complete reversal of Hitler&#x27;s view of Britain.

German historian Klaus Hildebrand has argued that the memorandum marked the beginning of an &quot;ambivalent course&quot; towards Britain. Likewise, Andreas Hillgruber contended that Hitler was embarking on expansion &quot;without Britain&quot;: preferably &quot;with Britain&quot; but, if necessary, &quot;against Britain&quot;.

The first part of the document noted Hitler&#x27;s wish that Germany should strive for autarky, as he reasoned that reliance on others makes a state weak. That has been labelled by some historians as a way of preparing Germany for conflict by ensuring that it was not economically reliant on states with which it could soon be at war. The memorandum&#x27;s suggestion that certain types of autarky were not possible can thus be considered reasons for regarding war as something of a necessity.

Indeed, the economic arguments appear to guarantee a war, out of concern that food supplies are reliant upon foreign trade in a world dominated by British-policed sea trade lanes:

The second part of the document detailed three &#x27;contingencies&#x27; that Hitler would take if certain situations prevailed in Europe, purportedly to ensure the security of the Reich. Beyond that, Hitler claimed that two &quot;hate-inspired antagonists&quot; (Britain and France) were blocking German foreign policy goals at every turn and that sometime in the next five years or so, Germany would have to achieve autarky by seizing Eastern Europe to prepare for a possible war with the British and the French.

After the conference, three of the attendees (Blomberg, Fritsch, and Neurath) all argued that the foreign policy Hitler had outlined was too risky, as Germany needed more time to rearm. Also, they stated that the &#x27;contingencies&#x27; that Hitler described as the prerequisite for war were too unlikely to occur, such as the apparent certainty expressed in the document of the Spanish Civil War leading to a Franco-Italian war in the Mediterranean Sea, or that France was on the verge of civil war. Moreover, it was argued that any German aggression in Eastern Europe was bound to trigger a war with France because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, and that if a Franco-German war broke out, Britain was almost certain to intervene to prevent France&#x27;s defeat. Thus, any German attack on the states of Eastern Europe such as Czechoslovakia was likely to lead to war with the British and the French before Germany was fully rearmed and ready for war with the other great powers. As such, Fritsch, Blomberg, and Neurath advised Hitler to wait until Germany had more time to rearm before pursuing a high-risk strategy of pursuing localised wars that was likely to trigger a general war before Germany was ready for such a war. All of those present at the conference had no moral objections to Hitler&#x27;s strategy, but were divided on timing only. By February 1938, Neurath, Fritsch, and Blomberg had been removed from their positions. Some historians, such as Sir John Wheeler-Bennett and William L. Shirer, believed that Blomberg, Fritsch, and Neurath were removed because of their opposition to the plans expressed in the Hossbach memorandum.

The accuracy of the memorandum has been questioned, as the minutes were drawn up five days after the event by Hossbach from notes that he took at the meeting and also from memory. Also, Hitler did not review the minutes of the meeting; instead he insisted, as he commonly did, that he was too busy to bother with such small details. British historian A. J. P. Taylor contended that the manuscript that was used by the prosecution in the Nuremberg Trials appears to be a shortened version of the original, as it had passed through the United States Army before the trial. Taylor drew attention to one thing that the memorandum can be used to prove: &quot;Goering, Raeder and Neurath had sat by and approved of Hitler&#x27;s aggressive plans.&quot; However, that did not necessarily mean that Hitler laid down his plans for the domination of Europe, as there was no active decision to start a war made in the memorandum, only a decision about when war would be practical. However, Hitler mentioned his wish for increased armaments.

Taylor attempted to discredit the document by using the fact that the future annexations described in the &#x27;contingencies&#x27; were unlike those that occurred in 1939. However, opposing historians, such as Hugh Trevor-Roper, have pointed out that the memorandum still demonstrated an intention for adding Austria, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Poland to the Reich. Taylor also stipulated that the meeting was most likely a piece of internal politics, and he pointed out that Hitler could have been trying to encourage the gathering&#x27;s members to put pressure on the Reich Minister of Economics and President of the &quot;Reichsbank&quot;, Hjalmar Schacht, to release more funding for rearmament. In fact, Schacht soon resigned in protest of the pre-eminence of rearmament in Nazi economics. Contending historians have also pointed out that rearmament is an integral part of a preparation for conflict. In response, Taylor argued that Hitler&#x27;s policy was a bluff (he wished to rearm Germany to frighten and intimidate other states) to allow him to achieve his foreign policy goals without going to war.

In addition, Taylor argued that most of the &#x27;contingencies&#x27; that Hitler listed as the prerequisite for war, such as an outbreak of civil war in France or the Spanish Civil War that led to a war between Italy and France in the Mediterranean Sea, did not occur. Trevor-Roper countered that criticism by arguing that Hitler expressed an intention to go to war sooner rather than later and that it was Hitler&#x27;s intentions in foreign policy in late 1937, as opposed to his precise plans later in history, that really mattered.

==Intentionalist and structuralist arguments==

It is often used by intentionalist historians such as Gerhard Weinberg, Andreas Hillgruber, and Richard Overy to prove that Hitler planned to start a general European war, which became the Second World War, as part of a longtime master plan. However, functionalist historians such as Timothy Mason, Hans Mommsen, and Ian Kershaw argue that the document shows no such plans, but the memorandum was an improvised &quot;ad hoc&quot; response by Hitler to the growing crisis in the German economy in the late 1930s.

<text>The numbered musical notation (, not to be confused with the integer notation) is a cipher notation system used in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and to some extent in Japan, Indonesia (in a slightly different format called &quot;not angka&quot;), Malaysia, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and English-speaking Canada. It dates back to the system designed by Pierre Galin, known as [[Galin-Paris-Chevé system]]. It is also known as Ziffernsystem, meaning &quot;number system&quot; or &quot;cipher system&quot; in German.

==Description==

===Musical notes===
Numbers 1 to 7 represent the musical notes (more accurately the scale degrees). They always correspond to the diatonic major scale. For example, in the key of C, their relationship with the notes and the solfège is as follows:
In G:
When the notes are read aloud or sung, they are called &quot;do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si&quot;. (&quot;Si&quot; has been supplanted in English by &quot;ti&quot;, for the sake of having a different beginning consonant for each degree.)

===Octaves===
Dots above or below a musical note raise or lower it to other octaves. The number of dots equals the number of octaves. For example, &quot;&quot; is an octave lower than &quot;6&quot;. Musical scales can thus be written as follows: 
Where there is more than one dot above or below the number, the dots are vertically stacked: 

Where there are note length lines (see following section) underneath the numbers, any dots are placed below the lines. Thus the dots below numbers do not always vertically align with each other, since some of them may be moved slightly downward so as not to collide with the note length lines.

===Chords===
Chords can be transcribed by vertically stacking the notes, with the lowest note at the bottom as with Western notation. Each note has its own octave dots, but only the lowest note has the length lines (next section).

Arpeggiated chords are notated by writing the standard Western arpeggiation symbol to the left of the chord.

Chord symbols such as Cm may be used if the exact voicing is unimportant.

===Note length===
The plain number represents a quarter note (crotchet). Each underline halves the note length: One represents an eighth note (quaver), two represent a sixteenth note (semiquaver), and so on. Dashes after a note lengthen it, each dash by the length of a quarter note.

A dot after the plain or underlined note works increases its length by half, and two dots by three quarters.

The underline, along with its joining, are analogous to the number of flags and beaming in standard notation. So are dotted notes.
===Musical rest===
The number &quot;0&quot; represents the musical rest. The rules for length is similar to that of the note, except that it is customary to repeat &quot;0&quot; instead of adding dashes for rests longer than a quarter rest. The bar rest of time is codice_1 and the bar rest of time is codice_2. A more general symbol for a bar rest is codice_3. The multi-bar rest symbol used in standard notation may also be adopted.

===Undetermined pitch===
When notating rhythms without pitch, such as in many percussion instruments, the symbol &quot;X&quot; or &quot;x&quot; replaces numerals. For example, a common clap pattern used in cheers can be written like this:

 4/4
 Clap: | X X X X X | X X X X 0 ||

===Bar lines===
Bar lines, double bar lines, end bar lines, repeat signs, first- and second-endings look very similar to their counterparts in the standard notation. The ending numbers, though, are usually slightly less than half as big as the numerals representing notes.

When several lines of music are notated together to be sung or played in harmony, the bar lines usually extend through all the parts, except they do not cut across the lyrics if these are printed between the upper and lower parts. However, when notating music for a two-handed instrument (such as the guzheng), it is common for the bar lines of each hand to be drawn separately, but a score bracket to be drawn on the left of the page to &quot;bind&quot; the two hands together. This bracket is not the same as the bracket used on a Western piano staff; it&#x27;s more like the bracket used to bind an orchestral section together in Western music. Sometimes the final double barline, and any barlines marked with repeat signs, also pass through both hands, but this is not consistent even in the same publication.

If a piece of music for a two-handed instrument has a passage where only one hand is notated, lines of numbered notation without score brackets at the left can be used for this passage. Hence a piece of music may shift between two-handed (with bracket) and one-handed (without bracket) layouts during the course of the piece.

Cadenza-like passages can have dotted barlines, or barlines can be omitted altogether.

It is possible to print a small fermata above a bar line; this represents a brief pause between the measures either side of the barline, as in Western notation.

===Accidentals and key signature===
The notation uses a movable Do (1) system. The key signature defines the pitch of &quot;1&quot;. So codice_4 means &quot;C major&quot;. Minor keys are based on the natural minor or the Aeolian mode, and the key signature defines the pitch of &quot;6&quot; of the minor key&#x27;s relative major. codice_5 can be used to refer to A minor, the tonic of which is written as 6. Naturally, the Dorian mode of D can in principle be marked as codice_6 and based on 2. In common practice, however, either are normally denoted as codice_4.

The same accidentals in the standard notation are used, and as in common practice, an accidental is placed before the notes &quot;1 2 3 4 5 6 7&quot; to raise or lower the pitch and placed after the note names &quot;C D E F G A B&quot;, which are used for key signature and chord markings in the numbered system. But these accidentals are relative to the diatonic scale (1 2 3...) rather than the note names (C D E...). For example, even though the leading note for the harmonic C minor scale is B natural, it is written as &quot;5&quot;.

In the Indonesian version of numbered musical notation known as &quot;not angka&quot;, accidentals are notated using right slanted line (like /) to raise the tone a half step and left slanted line (like \) to lower the tone a half step, for example: 1/ read as C, 2/ read as D, 4/ read as F, 5/ read as G, 6/ read as A, 2\ read as D, 3\ read as E, 5\ read as G, 6\ read as A and 7\ read as B. In printed not angka, these lines are overprinted on the figures.

Key signature changes are marked above the line of music. They may be accompanied by symbols that represent the note&#x27;s degrees at previous and present key signatures.

===Time signature===
The time signature is written as a horizontal fraction: codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, etc. It is usually placed after the key signature. Change of time signature within the piece of music may be marked in-line or above the line of music. Some pieces that start with cadenza passages are not marked with time signatures until the end of that passage, even if the passage uses dotted barlines (in which case time is usually implied).

Sometimes a piece is written with multiple time signatures simultaneously. For example, it might specify codice_12, meaning that the length of measures is irregular and can be 4, 2, 3 or 5 quarter-notes. The time signature of the first measure is always specified first, and the others are placed in increasing order of length.

Usually, the time signature is formatted as two numbers placed vertically on top of each other, with a horizontal line separating them. This is slightly different from the formatting illustrated in the text above, due to technical restrictions.

A metronome mark may be placed immediately after the time signature if the time signature is part-way through the music, or below it if the time signature is at the beginning. If present, this will be identical to the metronome marks used in Western music (this is the only place in numbered notation where Western symbols for note values such as quarter-notes and eighth-notes are used).

===Expression marks and dynamics===
Expression marks (including fermatas) are also written above the music line. Special attention has to be paid on the staccato dot since it looks like the octave changer. It is either represented by a bolder dot further away from the music line or by the staccatissimo sign instead, which is an inverted triangle.

Dynamics (, , , etc.) and hairpin crescendos and diminuendos are written below the line of music to which they apply, as in Western notation. The font of the dynamics is usually lighter than the font used in Western notation, so as not to be as heavy as the font for the numbers.

===Fingering and other instrument-specific marks===
Instrument-specific symbols can be written above notes. For example, in music for stringed instruments it is common to see wavy lines representing rolls. Fingering can be marked using four different kinds of finger symbol, respectively appearing like a lightning strike, the top half of a semicircle, a backslash, and the bottom left corner of a square.

Other instrument-specific symbols that are sometimes used include one resembling three slashes progressing diagonally downward, placed to the lower right of the numeral. This represents a tremolo. Another symbol is formed of a line proceeding from slightly to the right of the top right corner of the numeral and curving upwards, ending with the left half of an arrowhead. This denotes a slide to a higher note (the exact pitch not always being specified), equivalent to portamento in Western music.

If there are slurs or ties and also fingering symbols, then the fingering symbols are written above the slurs or ties. Rolls (wavy lines) and tuplets are usually written below the slurs or ties. However, if a one-off chord results in many digits being stacked on top of each other and also has a roll symbol, it is possible to place that roll symbol above any slur or tie line to save space (to avoid moving the slur or tie any higher than the chord has already needed to move it).

===Glissandi===
Glissandi are represented by diagonal wavy lines with arrowheads at the end. The glissando symbol proceeds from bottom left to top right for an upward glissando, or from top left to bottom right for a downward glissando. It is used in place of a numeral. For stringed instruments, it usually indicates playing all the notes of the scale in rapid succession, i.e. for a downward glissando,

: 6 5 3 2 1

and for an upward glissando,

:1 2 3 5 6 

Note that a pentatonic scale is normally used in Traditional Chinese music, so &quot;all the notes of the scale&quot; in this case are 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.

Extended glissandi (over several octaves) are also possible, usually written with a longer diagonal wavy line that is nearly touching the numbers on either side of it. In this case the numbers on either side determine the starting and ending pitches for the glissando.

===Grace notes===
Grace notes are notated like normal notes but are written in a small (about half-size) script on the line just above. They are written with octave dots and note-length lines, and they are connected to the main note with a slur that proceeds vertically downward from the center of the note-length line of the grace notes and points toward the main note. Grace notes may be placed either before or after the main note, indicating that they are to be played very rapidly either before the start of the main note or after the end.

==Variations==
In some versions of the numbered musical notation, underlines indicating note length are written above the note instead. Ties and slurs may be written below the music line.

In some versions, octave change is represented in a different way. Instead of dots above or below the numbers, a horizontal line is drawn and the number is written on, above, or below the line.

Another variation is to put octave bar &quot;|&quot; on the side of the number. An octave bar on the left is equivalent to a dot at the bottom. An octave bar on the right is equivalent to a dot on top. This is used in Digital Common Notation. Digital Common Notation attempts to combine the benefits of the standard notation and numbered musical notation and is targeted for keyboard performing.

==History and usage==
The franciscan priest introduced numbered notation in 17th century. A similar invention was presented by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his work presented to the French Academy of Sciences in 1742. Due to its straightforward correspondence to the standard notation, it is possible that many other claims of independent invention are also true. Grove&#x27;s credits Emile J. M. Chevé.

Although the system is used to some extent in Germany, France, and the Netherlands, and more by the Mennonites in Russia, it has never become popular in the Western world. Number notation was used extensively in the 1920s and 30s by Columbia University, Teachers College music educator Satis Coleman, who felt it &quot;proved to be very effective for speed with adults, and also as a means simple enough for young children to use in writing and reading tunes which they sing, and which they play on simple instruments.&quot; See the external links for more information.

The system is very popular among some Asian people, making conventions to encode and decode music more accessible than in the West, as more Chinese people can sight read &quot;jianpu&quot; than standard notation. Most Chinese traditional music scores and popular song books are published in &quot;jianpu&quot;, and &quot;jianpu&quot; notation is often included in vocal music with staff notation. This was first introduced in Japan, later adopted by several Chinese overseas students including Li Shutong.

Indexing with numbered notation makes it possible to search a piece of music by melody rather than by title. An actual example can be found in the Chinese New Hymnal. Parson&#x27;s code on the other hand contains information on rise and fall in pitch only but precise pitches can be decoded from numbered notation. This way, a children&#x27;s song book can be indexed like this:

:codice_13 &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot;
:codice_14 &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&quot;
:codice_15 &quot;Frère Jacques&quot;

A reason for its popularity among Chinese is that &quot;jianpu&quot; fits in with the Chinese music tradition. It is a natural extension and unification of the &quot;gongche&quot; notation widely used in ancient China for recording music. &quot;Gongche&quot; uses a number of characters to indicate the musical notes, and &quot;jianpu&quot; can be seen as using numbers to replace those characters. The monophonic nature of music in Chinese tradition also contributes to widespread use because so few elements are needed for monophonic music that music can be notated with little more than a typewriter.

Compared with the standard notation, the numbered notation is very compact for just the melody line or monophonic parts. It is even possible to transcribe music in between the lines of text. Transcribing harmony can be done by vertically stacking the notes, but this advantage diminishes as the harmony becomes more complex (or polyphonicity increases). The standard notation, with its graphical notation, is better in representing the duration and timing among multiple notes.

==Examples==

The two images below illustrate how the same piece of music is written using the standard notation and the numbered notation. 
 


==ASCII &quot;online Jianpu&quot;==

Since the advent of the Internet and the popularization of web browser–based communication using common keyboard input, the &quot;Jianpu&quot; cipher notion has been adopted to easier input formats, including one that utilizes mainly ordinary symbols available on an ASCII keyboard. For example, the first stanza of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; can simply be transcribed as below: 

 / 005 // 
 / 1&#x27;0(3&#x27;1&#x27;) / 3&#x27;02&#x27; / 1&#x27;06 / 505 //
 / 1&#x27;0(3&#x27;1&#x27;) / 3&#x27;0(2&#x27;3&#x27;) / 5&#x27;00 / 00(2&#x27;3&#x27;) //
 / 5&#x27;0(3&#x27;1&#x27;) / 3&#x27;0(3&#x27;2&#x27;) / 1&#x27;06 / 505 //
 / 1&#x27;0(3&#x27;1&#x27;) / 3&#x27;02&#x27; / 1&#x27;00! / 000 //

==Computing==
A number of Chinese-language Microsoft Windows applications are available for the WYSIWYG editing of scores (optionally with lyrics) in numbered musical notation. Typically these support only the numbered notation, i.e. it is not possible to mix the numbered notation with a Western-style score in the same file. It was possible to add numbered notation to Sibelius scores via a Chinese-language third-party plugin which is no longer distributed. English-language applications for working with numbered-notation scores are relatively rare, but there have been some developments.

In 2019 a project was started to create a cross-platform English-Chinese scorewriter that can print jianpu, Western or tablature staves and saves its scores in MusicXML using LGPL components.

There are also technical methods of printing numbered notation (in various forms) with GNU LilyPond. One of them is a converter that converts jianpu to LilyPond notation.

Duolos SIL Cipher is a free font developed by SIL International and released under OFL license, it makes use of Graphite and OpenType smart font technologies for laying out Jianpu and Kepatihan, makes it possible to edit and print scores in numbered musical notation with word processors, desktop publishing software and others, although it lacks of support for the slurs in OpenType applications.

x-Vacle is another OFL-licensed font designed for numbered musical notation using OpenType technology, based on glyphs from other open-source fonts. Unlike Duolos SIL Cipher, it doesn&#x27;t require extra line height.

<text>Minutes, also known as minutes of meeting (abbreviation MoM), protocols or, informally, notes, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing. They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the activities considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the activities.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;minutes&quot; possibly derives from the Latin phrase &quot;minuta scriptura&quot; (literally &quot;small writing&quot;) meaning &quot;rough notes&quot;.

== Creation ==
Minutes may be created during the meeting by a typist or court reporter, who may use shorthand notation and then prepare the minutes and issue them to the participants afterwards. Alternatively, the meeting can be audio recorded, video recorded, or a group&#x27;s appointed or informally assigned secretary may take notes, with minutes prepared later. Many government agencies use minutes recording software to record and prepare all minutes in real-time.

== Purpose ==
Minutes are the official written record of the meetings of an organization or group. They are not transcripts of those proceedings. Using &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR), the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was &quot;done&quot; at the meeting, not what was &quot;said&quot; by the members. The organization may have its own rules regarding the content of the minutes.

For most organizations or groups, it is important for the minutes to be terse and only include a summary of the decisions. A report (transcript) is typically not useful. Unless the organization&#x27;s rules require it, a summary of the discussions in a meeting is neither necessary nor appropriate.

The minutes of certain groups, such as a corporate board of directors, must be kept on file and are important legal documents. Minutes from board meetings are kept separately from minutes of general membership meetings within the same organization. Also, minutes of executive sessions may be kept separately. Committees are not required to keep formal minutes although less formal notes may be taken. For committees, their formal records are the reports submitted to their parent body.

==Format==
The format of the minutes can vary depending on the standards established by an organization, although there are general guidelines. Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order contains a sample set of minutes.

Generally, minutes begin with the name of the body holding the meeting (e.g., a board) and may also include the place, date, list of people present, and the time that the chair called the meeting to order.

Since the primary function of minutes is to record the decisions made, all official decisions must be included. If a formal motion is proposed and seconded, then (regardless whether it passes) this is recorded. The voting tally may also be included. The part of the minutes dealing with a routine motion might note merely that a particular motion was &quot;moved by Ann and passed&quot;. It is not strictly necessary to include the name of the person who seconds a motion. Where a tally is included, it is sufficient to record the number of people voting for and against a motion, but requests by participants to note their votes by name may be allowed. If a decision is made by roll-call vote, then all of the individual votes are recorded by name. If it is made by general consent without a formal vote, then this fact may be recorded.

The minutes may end with a note of the time that the meeting was adjourned.

Minutes are sometimes submitted by the person who is responsible for them (often the secretary) at a subsequent meeting for review. The traditional closing phrase is &quot;Respectfully submitted&quot; (although this is no longer common), followed by the officer&#x27;s signature, his or her typed (or printed) name, and his or her title. That closing phrase developed from &quot;respectively submitted&quot;, expressing a claim that the order in which the various events are recorded in the minutes matches the order in which they occurred during the actual meeting.

Usually, one of the first items in an order of business or an agenda for a meeting is the reading and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting. If the members of the group agree (usually by unanimous consent) that the written minutes reflect what happened at the previous meeting, then they are approved, and the fact of their approval is recorded in the minutes of the current meeting. If there are significant errors or omissions, then the minutes may be redrafted and submitted again at a later date. Minor changes may be made immediately using the normal amendment procedures, and the amended minutes may be approved &quot;as amended&quot;. It is normally appropriate to send a draft copy of the minutes to all the members in advance of the meeting so that the meeting is not delayed by a reading of the draft.

<text>Sir Howard Leslie Morrison (18 August 1935 – 24 September 2009) was a New Zealand entertainer. From 1964 until his death in 2009, he was one of New Zealand&#x27;s leading television and concert performers.

==Early life==
Of Māori (Te Arawa), Irish, and Scottish descent, Morrison was born to Temuera Leslie Morrison, a Māori All Black who worked for the Māori Affairs Department, and Kahurangi Morrison (née Gertrude Harete Davidson) who was known for her work in culture and entertainment.

He grew up in Rotorua and in Ruatahuna near Waikaremoana. He attended a &quot;native school&quot; in the Urewera before going to Te Aute College and Rotorua Boys&#x27; High School.

After leaving school he had a variety of manual jobs including survey chainman, electricity meter reader and storeman at the Whakatu freezing works.

==Family==

Morrison and his three surviving sisters, Judy Tapsell, Rene Mitchell and Linda Morrison, lost their oldest brother Laurie in 1974. Another brother, Charlie, died in infancy and youngest sister Atareta Maxwell died suddenly in January 2007 from a heart attack. Their mother Kahurangi died in 1995, and their father Temuera when they were young.
==Career==

In 1955, Morrison assembled vocal groups to entertain at Rotorua rugby club socials. In 1956, he was a member of the successful Aotearoa Concert Party that toured Australia. In this group was Gerry Merito who with Morrison formed the Ohinemutu Quartet which was later renamed the Howard Morrison Quartet. Other original members of the quartet were Morrison&#x27;s brother Laurie and his cousin John, but they left and were replaced by Wi Wharekura and Noel Kingi who were fixtures in the quartet at its heights. In 1966 he appeared in the John O&#x27;Shea film Don&#x27;t Let It Get You. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s he was the spokesman for Bic products such as lighters and pens, appearing in many television commercials for the brand.

The hymn &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; became Morrison&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; theme song for the latter part of his career, after a recording of it by Morrison became one of the country&#x27;s biggest selling singles.

==Honours and achievements==

In 1970, he received the Benny Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand Inc.

In the 1976 New Year Honours, Morrison was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to entertainment, and he was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, also for services to entertainment.

In March 2006, Morrison was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Waikato, joining such alumni as Janet Frame, Dame Malvina Major, Hare Puke, Tui Adams, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Neil and Tim Finn, Michael King, Margaret Mahy and Rotorua historian Don Stafford in receiving the award.

At the 2007 Creative New Zealand Te Waka Toi awards Morrison received the Te Tohu Tiketike a Te Waka Toi Award for Maori Artists.

On 14 October 2009, Morrison was selected by Te Aute College to be a part of its &quot;1st XV leaders group&quot; at a function at Te Papa in Wellington. The honour is given to former pupils over the age of 55 who have made a significant contribution to Māori society. Morrison attended Te Aute College from 1949 to 1952.

<text>WarCry is an out-of-print collectible card game set in the world of Warhammer Fantasy and published by Sabertooth Games. The base game cards were released in 2003, with newer expansions introduced in the months since. A video game adaptation, titled &quot;&quot;, was created for the PSP in 2006.

==Gameplay summary==
In WarCry the opposing players become generals of vast armies and wage battles for control over the Old World. Each game is divided into three segments called &quot;battles&quot;. The outcome of each battle is determined after both players pass consecutively. Their &quot;Victory Points&quot; totals are compared and the player with the highest total wins the battle. The player who wins two out of the three battles is the winner.

To begin playing the game each player needs two decks - the &quot;Army Deck&quot; and the &quot;Action Deck&quot; - containing a minimum of 30 cards each.

The &quot;Army Deck&quot; consists cards representing units that will fight for you, the heroes that may fight alongside a given unit and magical weapons, armor or other items that can somehow help swing the tide of battle in your favour.

The &quot;Action Deck&quot; has cards that represent special strategies, powerful attacks and other tricks that every leader has to know in order to win.

Each &quot;battle&quot; is divided into two phases: the &quot;muster phase&quot; and the &quot;combat phase&quot;.

In the &quot;muster phase&quot; players take turns placing unit or equipment cards on the table. Each such card has a cost in Gold points. In the first battle both players can muster units for up to 20 Gold, in the second - up to 25, and in the third - up to 30.

When both players are done mustering units the combat phase begins. The opponents take turns issuing commands (a command can be an attack, a move or playing a special card from hand). After they both pass successively the battle ends. The player with the most &quot;Victory Points&quot; (calculated by adding the strength of the surviving units) wins.

==Card types==
WarCry includes cards for the Grand Alliance (featuring blue marble backgrounds), the Hordes of Darkness (featuring black backgrounds with bones or fire), and neutral cards (featuring green backgrounds with leaf vines). The cards are further broken down into the following types:

*Units - Unit cards represent small armies or soldiers on the battlefield, including infantry, cavalry, and flying units.
*Attachments - Attachment cards are attached to units, where they generally remain until the unit is destroyed. They can confer bonuses or additional abilities.
*Actions - Action cards are used during combat to help friendly units or punish the enemy. They represent things such as strategies, tactics, or unexpected events.

==Card sets==
WarCry cards were released in sets each containing 120 unique cards (with exceptions noted below). They could be purchased in randomized booster packs of 9 playable cards and one redeemable &quot;Gold Piece&quot; card. On July 1, 2006, the Sabertooth Games redemption program officially ended, with newer boosters no longer containing any redeemable cards. On December 12, 2006, Sabertooth announced that &quot;Veterans of Battle&quot; (released in early 2007) would be the final WarCry product release and that support for organized play would cease few months later.

<text>The (LHD) is a fusion research device located in Toki, Gifu, Japan. It is operated by the National Institute for Fusion Science, and is the world&#x27;s second-largest superconducting stellarator, after Wendelstein 7-X. The LHD employs a heliotron magnetic field originally developed in Japan.

The objective of the project is to conduct fusion plasma confinement research in a steady state in order to elucidate possible solutions to physics and engineering problems in helical plasma reactors. The LHD uses neutral beam injection, ion cyclotron radio frequency (ICRF), and electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) to heat the plasma, much like conventional tokamaks. The helical divertor heat and particle exhaust system uses the large helical coils to produce a diverting field. This configuration allows for the modification of the stochastic layer size, which is positioned between the confined plasma volume and the field lines that terminate on the divertor plate. Boundary plasma research at LHD focuses on the capability of the helical divertor as an exhaust system for heliotrons and stellarators.

==History==
* Design finalized 1987
* Start of construction 1990
* Plasma operations from 1998
* Neutral beam injection of 3 MW was used in 1999.
* In 2005 it maintained a plasma for 3,900 seconds.
* In 2006 a new helium cooler was added. Using the new cooler, by 2018 a total of 10 long term operations have been achieved, reaching a maximum power level of 11.833 kA.
* To aid public acceptance, an exhaust system was designed to catch and filter the radioactive tritium the fusion process produces.

<text>James Ager Worthy (born February 27, 1961) is an American former professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;Big Game James&quot;, he played his entire professional career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Worthy was a seven-time NBA All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Team member who won three NBA championships and was voted the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1988. He was named to both the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams.

A standout college basketball player for the North Carolina Tar Heels, the small forward was a consensus first-team All-American and shared national player of the year honors en route to leading his team to the 1982 NCAA championship. Named the NCAA tournament Most Outstanding Player, he was selected by the Lakers with the first overall pick of the 1982 NBA draft.

==Early life==
Worthy was born in Gastonia, North Carolina. His 21.5 points, 12.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game during his senior season at Ashbrook High led the team to the state championship game. Named both a &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; and McDonald&#x27;s All-American, he was selected to play in the 1979 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game, which featured future fellow Hall of Famers including Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins, and Ralph Sampson.

==College career==
After graduating from high school, Worthy attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. An immediate standout as a freshman, his debut was cut short near mid-season by a broken ankle. As a sophomore, he was a key member of UNC&#x27;s 1981 NCAA runner-up team starring alongside Al Wood and Sam Perkins.

As a junior power forward Worthy was the leading scorer (15.6 points per game) of a Tar Heels NCAA championship team that featured one of the greatest collections of talent in collegiate basketball history, including future NBA stars sophomore Sam Perkins and freshman Michael Jordan. A consensus first-team All-American, Worthy was named co-winner of the Helms Foundation Player of the Year with Ralph Sampson of Virginia. He dominated the 1982 championship game against the Georgetown Hoyas, sealing the Tar Heels&#x27; 63–62 victory by intercepting an inadvertent pass thrown by Hoya point guard Fred Brown with just seconds remaining. His 13–17 shooting, 28 point, 4 rebound finale capped a standout performance throughout the NCAA tournament, earning him its Most Outstanding Player award. A tip dunk in front of Patrick Ewing captioned &quot;James Worthy slams the door on Georgetown&quot; made the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

In the wake of this success, Worthy elected to forgo his senior year and enter the NBA draft. He completed his degree later, via summer school. He is one of eight players to have their numbers retired by the Tar Heels. In 2002, Worthy was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team honoring the fifty greatest players in Atlantic Coast Conference history.

==Professional career==
===Number 1 pick===
The Los Angeles Lakers had received the Cleveland Cavaliers&#x27; 1982 first-round draft pick in a 1979 exchange for Don Ford. The Cavaliers finished with the NBA&#x27;s worst record in the 1981–82 season, leaving a coin toss to decide whether they or the worst record runner-up San Diego Clippers would get the first overall pick in the upcoming draft. The Lakers won the flip, the first and only time a reigning NBA champion picked first overall. They chose Worthy over Dominique Wilkins and Terry Cummings.

===1982–1983===
The lanky small forward immediately made an impact as a rookie, averaging 13.4 points per game and shooting a Laker rookie record .579 field goal percentage. With his speed, dynamic ability to score with either hand, and dazzling play above the rim, Worthy thrived in the Lakers&#x27; high-octane &quot;Showtime&quot; offense. When not finishing fast breaks with his trademark Statue of Liberty dunks or swooping finger rolls, Worthy was also one of the best post players at his position, with a quick spin move off the low blocks and a deadly turnaround midrange jumpshot. His rookie year ended just when he was hitting his stride, breaking his leg on April 10, 1983, while landing improperly after trying to tap in a missed shot against the Phoenix Suns. He was still named to the 1983 All-Rookie First Team but missed the rest of the season and playoffs, with the Lakers being swept 4–0 by the Philadelphia 76ers in the Finals.

===1983–1984===
Back and healthy for the opening of the 1983–84 season, Worthy began the season as a starter at power forward in place of Kurt Rambis, who was on the injured reserve list. By December, Lakers head coach Pat Riley said that &quot;it&#x27;s becoming more and more obvious Worthy is not a legitimate power forward&quot; due to his rebounding, describing him as &quot;a finesse guy who likes to get the ball and go with it&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;he really is a small forward in a big forward&#x27;s body.&quot; Worthy returned to the small forward position and came off the bench after Rambis recovered from his foot injuries. Riley cited Rambis&#x27;s defense and rebounding. Worthy provided offense as a sixth man and was also prone to foul trouble. He developed into one of the league&#x27;s top small forwards. He remained as a reserve even when All-Star small forward Jamaal Wilkes was sidelined by a gastrointestinal illness during the playoffs, as Riley opted to start Michael Cooper instead. However, Worthy became a starter in the final game of the Western Conference finals against the Suns. He was essential for the Lakers during the 1984 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. Late in Game 2, Worthy made an errant cross-court pass that was stolen by Gerald Henderson and taken in for the game-tying score, leading to a Celtics win in overtime. Boston won the series in seven games. Worthy had a very strong Finals, with 22.1 pts per game (second to Abdul-Jabbar) on 63.8% shooting. The Lakers would go into the off-season bitter about the loss and motivated for 1985.

===1984–1985===
Worthy began the 1984–85 season as a reserve, while Wilkes returned as the starting small forward. After the Lakers opened the season slowly and were outrebounded in each of their first four games, Riley started Worthy in place of Rambis. &quot;We&#x27;re looking for rebounding. We&#x27;re experimenting&quot;, said the coach. A few games later, Riley replaced Wilkes in the starting lineup with Larry Spriggs. The Lakers dominated the West and returned to the NBA Finals. During the play-off run Worthy emerged as a feared clutch performer, averaging 21.5 points per game on 62.2% shooting in the playoffs and 23.7 points per game in a match-up against the Celtics in the championship series. His all-round play helped lead the team to a 4–2 victory clinched on the celebrated parquet floor of the old Boston Garden and confirmed him as one of the league&#x27;s premier players. It was also in 1985 that Worthy first donned goggles after suffering a scratched cornea during a March 13 game at the Utah Jazz, wearing them for the rest of his career.

===1985–1986===

The 1985–86 season held tremendous promise for the Lakers, who again stormed through the regular season and seemed destined to meet Boston once again. 
Worthy continued to improve, raising his scoring from 17.6 to 20 points per game on 58% shooting and was named to the first of seven consecutive All-Star appearances. A trip to the Finals disappeared in a preternatural tip in the Western Conference final by 7&#x27; 4&quot; Houston Rockets star Ralph Sampson, with the Rockets going on to be drubbed by the Celtics in the Championship series.

===1986–1987===
With stalwart center Abdul-Jabbar finally showing signs of his age the Lakers added center-forward Mychal Thompson during the 1986–1987 regular season to address the need for frontcourt help. The result was a 65–17 record and what many regard as one of the NBA&#x27;s all-time great teams sprinting to another NBA title over the Celtics. Worthy was at the top of his game, leading the team with 23.6 points per game in the playoffs. He had a number of huge games during this &#x27;87 play-off run, in particular a vintage 39 point performance (including 6 dunks) in a 122–121 win at Seattle in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals and 33 pts 10 assists 9 rebounds in a game 1 victory in the NBA Finals versus the Celtics. The Lakers won the championship 4 games to 2.

===1987–1988===
Once again Riley drove the Lakers hard in 1987–88. During the regular season Worthy averaged 19.7 points and scored a career-high 38 points against the Atlanta Hawks. He led the Lakers in scoring in the 1988 play-offs and led the NBA in points scored during the play-offs. During the Finals against the Pistons Worthy once again excelled, averaging 22 ppg, 7.4 rebounds, and 4.4 assists in the series. A 28-point, 9 rebound Game 6 and monster 36–16–10 triple-double that carried the Lakers to victory in Game 7 earned Worthy the NBA Finals MVP award and the Lakers the first back-to-back titles in the NBA since &#x27;68–&#x27;69 Celtics.

===1988–1989===
With Riley clamoring for a &quot;Three-peat&quot; in 1988–89 the Lakers marched through the regular season and met the Pistons for an encore in the Finals. With Abdul-Jabbar playing his last games and Johnson and Byron Scott missing three due to injuries even Worthy at his play-off best was not nearly enough. In spite of averaging a career Finals high 25.5 ppg, including a career-high 40 points trying to stave off elimination in Game 4, the Lakers were swept in four.

===1989–1990===
The Lakers ran hot again in 1989–90 despite internal friction that had developed during Pat Riley&#x27;s final year as head coach, their 63–19 record the NBA&#x27;s best. Worthy averaged 21.1 points per game and became the first player in NBA history to shoot at least 53% in each of his first eight seasons. In spite of stepped-up performances by both Johnson (25.2 ppg) and Worthy (24.2 ppg) in the play-offs, LA fell in the Conference semifinals to a hot Phoenix Suns team.

===1990–1991===
The Lakers once more won the West in 1991 and marched through the playoffs to the Finals thanks to Worthy&#x27;s team-leading and career-high 21.4 ppg in &#x27;91 and the addition of former North Carolina Tarheel star Sam Perkins at center. Unfortunately, Worthy suffered a high ankle sprain in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Blazers and was very limited heading into the Finals against the Chicago Bulls. Despite LA pulling out a Game 1 victory in Chicago it ultimately wasn&#x27;t enough against a surging Bulls squad led by another teammate from the 1982 NCAA Championship team, an emergent Michael Jordan. The Lakers ultimately fell in five, with Worthy sidelined for Game 5 after re-injuring his ankle the previous game.

===Retirement===
Johnson&#x27;s sudden retirement in November 1991 threw the Lakers franchise into disarray. Injuries and high mileage soon spelled the end for Worthy. The high ankle injury during the 1991 playoffs and season-ending knee surgery in 1992 robbed much of his quickness and leaping ability, and with it both his ability to finish on the fast break and drive to the hoop to score. After struggling with knee pain in the 1994–95 preseason and no prospects of another title run in any foreseeable future, Worthy announced his retirement in November 1994, after 12 seasons in the NBA.

==&quot;Big Game James&quot;==
Even on Lakers teams dominated by fellow Hall of Fame members Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson, Worthy stood out as a star during their years together. He led the Lakers in playoff scoring in their championship runs in 1987 (23.6) and 1988 (21.1) and was second to Abdul-Jabbar in the 1985 championship run (21.5). He always saved his best for the playoffs and averaged 3.5 points higher per game than in the regular season. That, his heroics in the 1982 NCAA Championship game alongside Michael Jordan, spectacular offensive displays, and flashes of defensive brilliance, cemented his legacy as &quot;Big Game James&quot;.

Worthy played in 926 NBA regular-season games, averaging 17.6 points, 5.1 rebounds and three assists per game. He played in 143 playoff games and averaged 21.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game and had a 54.4 field goal percentage. In 34 NBA Finals games he averaged 22.2 pts per game on 53% shooting. Worthy played in 4 Game 7s in his career and averaged 27 points and 8.2 rebounds on 60% shooting in these winner-take-all contests. He ranks sixth all-time in Lakers team scoring (16,320), third all-time in team steals (1,041) and seventh all-time in team field goal percentage (.521). Worthy was voted one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. To commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Worthy as the 59th greatest player in NBA history. Worthy was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2003. His jersey No. 42 was retired by the Lakers.

<text>Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP or ThPP), or thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), or cocarboxylase is a thiamine (vitamin B1) derivative which is produced by the enzyme thiamine diphosphokinase. Thiamine pyrophosphate is a cofactor that is present in all living systems, in which it catalyzes several biochemical reactions.

Thiamine pyrophosphate is synthesized in the cytosol and is required in the cytosol for the activity of transketolase and in the mitochondria for the activity of pyruvate-, oxoglutarate- and branched chain keto acid dehydrogenases. To date, the yeast ThPP carrier (Tpc1p) the human Tpc and the &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; have been identified as being responsible for the mitochondrial transport of ThPP and ThMP. It was first discovered as an essential nutrient (vitamin) in humans through its link with the peripheral nervous system disease beriberi, which results from a deficiency of thiamine in the diet.

TPP works as a coenzyme in many enzymatic reactions, such as:

* Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
* Pyruvate decarboxylase in ethanol fermentation
* Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex
* Branched-chain amino acid dehydrogenase complex
* 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase 
* Transketolase

==Chemistry==
Chemically, TPP consists of a pyrimidine ring which is connected to a thiazole ring, which is in turn connected to a pyrophosphate (diphosphate) functional group.

The part of TPP molecule that is most commonly involved in reactions is the thiazole ring, which contains nitrogen and sulfur. Thus, the thiazole ring is the &quot;reagent portion&quot; of the molecule. The C2 of this ring is capable of acting as an acid by donating its proton and forming a carbanion. Normally, reactions that form carbanions are highly unfavorable, but the positive charge on the tetravalent nitrogen just adjacent to the carbanion stabilizes the negative charge, making the reaction much more favorable. A compound with positive and negative charges on adjacent atoms is called an ylide, so sometimes the carbanion form of TPP is referred to as the &quot;ylide form&quot;.

==Reaction mechanisms==
In several reactions, including that of pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase, TPP catalyses the reversible decarboxylation reaction (aka cleavage of a substrate compound at a carbon-carbon bond connecting a carbonyl group to an adjacent reactive group—usually a carboxylic acid or an alcohol). It achieves this in four basic steps:

#The carbanion of the TPP ylid nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl group on the substrate. (This forms a single bond between the TPP and the substrate.)
#The target bond on the substrate is broken, and its electrons are pushed towards the TPP. This creates a double bond between the substrate carbon and the TPP carbon and pushes the electrons in the N-C double bond in TPP entirely onto the nitrogen atom, reducing it from a positive to neutral form.
#In what is essentially the reverse of step two, the electrons push back in the opposite direction forming a new bond between the substrate carbon and another atom. (In the case of the decarboxylases, this creates a new carbon-hydrogen bond. In the case of transketolase, this attacks a new substrate molecule to form a new carbon-carbon bond.)
#In what is essentially the reverse of step one, the TPP-substrate bond is broken, reforming the TPP ylid and the substrate carbonyl.


The TPP thiazolium ring can be deprotonated at C2 to become an ylid:

<doc id="901075" wikidata="Q2642339" url="?curid=901075" title="Alphabet of Sirach">
<text>The Alphabet of Sira () is an anonymous text of the Middle Ages inspired by the Book of Sirach and written in a Muslim country between 700 and 1000. It is a compilation of two lists of proverbs, 22 in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and 22 in Medieval Hebrew, both arranged as alphabetic acrostics. Each proverb is followed by an aggadic commentary. Adolf Neubauer and Abraham Epstein argued for a satirical character, which reading was rejected by Louis Ginzberg.

It has been translated into Latin, Yiddish, Judaeo-Spanish, Judeo-Persian, French and German. An English translation by Norman Bronznick appeared in Stern and Mirsky (1998). A critical edition under the title was published by Eli Yassif in 1984.

==Aramaic proverbs==
The Aramaic proverbs are the older part of the book. Five of them can be traced to Talmudic-Midrashic literature. The Hebrew commentary, illustrating the proverbs with fables, is much younger.

In the reading of Ginzberg:
#&quot;Honor the physician before thou hast need of him&quot;, (Sirach 38:1)
#&quot;If a son do not conduct himself like a son, let him float on the water.&quot;
#&quot;Gnaw the bone that falls to thy lot whether it be good or bad.&quot;
#&quot;Gold must be hammered, and the child must be beaten.&quot;
#&quot;Be good and refuse not thy portion of good.&quot;
#&quot;Woe to the wicked man and woe to his companions.&quot;
#&quot;Cast thy bread upon the waters and upon the land, for thou shalt find it after many days&quot; (Eccles. 11:1)
#&quot;Hast thou seen a black ass? [Then] it was neither black nor white.&quot;
#&quot;Bestow no good upon that which is evil, and no evil will befall thee.&quot;
#&quot;Restrain not thy hand from doing good.&quot;
#&quot;The bride enters the bridal chamber and, nevertheless, knows not what will befall her.&quot;
#&quot;A nod to the wise is sufficient; the fool requires a blow.&quot; (Proverbs 22:15)
#&quot;He who honors them that despise him is like an ass.&quot;
#&quot;A fire, when it is kindled, burns many sheaves&quot; (James 3:5)
#&quot;An old woman in the house is a good omen in the house&quot;
#&quot;Even a good surety has to be applied to for a hundred morrows; a bad one for a hundred thousand.&quot;
#&quot;Rise quickly from the table and thou wilt avoid disputes.&quot;
#&quot;In thy business deal only with the upright.&quot;
#&quot;If the goods are near at hand, the owner consumes them; but if they are at a distance, they consume him.&quot;
#&quot;Do not disavow an old friend.&quot;
#&quot;Thou mayest have sixty counselors, but do not give up thy own opinion&quot;
#&quot;He that was first satisfied and then hungry will offer thee his hand; but not he that was first hungry and then satisfied.&quot;

==The second Alphabet==

The 22 Hebrew proverbs are quite different in character from the Aramaic ones, and much more recent. Half of the proverbs are borrowed from the Talmud, and are only a pretext for the presentation of a number of legends surrounding Ben Sira. Ben Sira is presented as the son of Jeremiah, born to the prophet&#x27;s own daughter who dipped in a mikveh into which Jeremiah was previously forced to lay seed. Ben Sira&#x27;s fame reached Nebuchadnezzar II, who called him to his court. Nebuchadnezzar sets forth various ordeals for Ben Sira, who responds with 22 stories.

<doc id="901077" wikidata="Q908269" url="?curid=901077" title="Thiaminase">
<text>Thiaminase is an enzyme that metabolizes or breaks down thiamine into pyrimidine and thiazole. It is an antinutrient when consumed.

The old name was &quot;aneurinase&quot;.

There are two types with different Enzyme Commission numbers:
* Thiamine pyridinylase, Thiaminase I (, )
** pyridine + thiamine &lt;=&gt; 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole + heteropyrithiamine
** Secreted by &quot;Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus&quot;, an anaerobic organism that occurs in the human small intestine
* Aminopyrimidine aminohydrolase, Thinaminase II (, , )
** 4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine + H2O &lt;=&gt; 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine + NH2+
** H2O + thiamine &lt;=&gt; 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine + 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole + H+
** Produced by a wide range of plants and bacteria. In these organisms, it is mainly responsible for &quot;salvage&quot; of thiamine pyrimidine from degradation products, rather than the breakdown of thiamine. In bacteria, it stays inside their cells.

== Structure and function ==

=== Thiaminase I ===
Thiaminase I works to cleave the pyrimidine ring in thiamin from the thiazolium ring at the methylene bridge. From there it adds a base compound to the pyrimidine, creating an analogue inhibitor of thiamin. Thiaminase I has the ability to use a multitude of C-N cleaving nucleophilic substrates like cysteine, pyridine, aniline, veratrylamine, dithiothreitol, and quinoline.

When analyzing the structure of Thiaminase I it shows a fold similar to that of group II periplasmic binding proteins like maltose-binding protein. These periplasmic binding proteins have two domains that each contain an α/β fold. These two domains come together to form a deep cleft that are connected by three crossover segments. Due to this structure scientists proposed that Thiaminase I could have evolved from prehistoric periplasmic binding protein that had been responsible for up taking thiamin. Between the two domains, in the cleft, sit the active site for Thiaminase I. Along the cleft there are four acidic residues and six tyrosine residues. In order for Thiamin to interact with Thiaminase I it is positioned in the active site between the pyrimidine and Asp272 by two hydrogen bonds. The Glu241 the goes on to activate the Cys113 to attack C6 of the pyrimidine. This forms a zwitterionic intermediate. The Glu241 causes and protonation and nucleophilic attack that results in the split of the bond between the pyrimidine and the thiazole. When observing the crystalline structure, it has two α/β-type domains separated by a large cleft. At room temperature the two molecules have a noncrystallographic twofold axis that are bridged by a sulfate ion. 

=== Thiaminase II ===
Thiaminase II cleaves but does not add a base compound. Thiaminase II can only use water as the nucleophile.

Thiaminase II has been found to be TenA. In order to cleave the C-N bond between the thiazole and pyrimidine Thiaminase only uses water as its nucleophile. When viewing Thiaminase II it is found to have a crystal structure that has 11 helices surrounding a deep acidic pocket. For each monomer present in the quaternary structure it interacts with two other monomers. There are several residues like Tyr112, Phe208, Tyr47, and Tyr163 that have some sort of contribution to the π- stacking environment surrounding the HMP ligand. The Glu205 side chain will form a hydrogen bond with the N1 nitrogen in the pyrimidine ring. Next the Tyr163 and the Asp44 side chain come together to form the hydrogen bonds with the N3 and N4&#x27;. Finally the Cys135 catalytic residue is positioned near the C2 in the pyridine ring to complete the split of thiamin into its heterocycles.

==Sources==
This enzyme can be found in a variety of different sources. It can be found in marine organisms, plants, and bacteria. Since thiamine (vitamin B1) is a very important substance required for metabolic pathways by almost all organisms, it can be very detrimental to introduce Thiaminase to a system. Frequently an organism gains this enzyme by ingesting another organism that carries it. In most cases, prey fish will contain one of the bacteria that produces this enzyme. When that prey fish is consumed raw without treatment the bacteria will transfer to the consumer. The consumer eventually will fall ill, even die, from a thiamine deficiency. This has been seen in different lab studies. Through these studies the enzyme has been found in zebra fish as well as red cornet fish. Cooking thiaminase-containing foods usually inactivates the enzyme.

Sources of thiaminase I include: 
* Plants: bracken (brake), nardoo, horsetail.
* Fish including zebra fish, carp and goldfish.
* Bacteria such as &quot;Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus&quot; (formerly in &quot;Bacillus&quot;), &quot;Clostridium sporogenes&quot;, &quot;C. botulinum&quot;.
* An African silk worm, &quot;Anaphe venata&quot;; this enzyme is more heat-tolerant than other thiaminases and requires a longer cooking time

Sources of thiaminase II include: 
* &quot;Bacillus aneurinolyticus&quot; and &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;.

==Effects==

=== Function ===
It is still unclear what thiaminase does for fish, bacterial cell or insects that contain it. In ferns, thiaminase I is thought to offer protection from insects

Studies have shown that thiamine hydrolase (thiaminase II), which was originally thought to be involved solely in the degradation of thiamine, has actually been identified as having a role in thiamine degradation with the salvage of the pyrimidine moiety. Thiamin hydrolysis product N-formyl-4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine is transported into the cell and deformylated by the amidohydrolase &quot;ylmB&quot; and hydrolyzed to 5-aminoimidazole ribotide.

=== When ingested ===
It was described in 1941 as the cause of highly mortal ataxic neuropathy in farmed foxes fed with raw carp.

It is also known as the cause of cerebrocortical necrosis of cattle and polioencephalomalasia of sheep eating thiaminase containing plants.

It was once causing economical losses in raising fisheries, e.g. in yellowtail fed raw anchovy as a sole feed for a certain period, and also in sea bream and rainbow trout. The same problem is being studied in a natural food chain system.

The larvae of a wild silk worm &quot;Anaphe venata&quot; are being consumed in a rain forest district of Nigeria as a supplemental protein nutrition, and the heat-resistant thiaminase in it is causing an acute seasonal cerebellar ataxia named African seasonal ataxia or Nigerian seasonal ataxia.

In 1860–61, Burke and Wills were the first Europeans to cross Australia south to north; on their return they subsisted primarily on raw nardoo-fern. It is possible that this led to their death due to the extremely high levels of thiaminase contained in nardoo. The Aborigines prepared nardoo by soaking the sporocarps in water for at least a day to avoid the effects of thiamine deficiency that would result from ingesting the leaves raw. In the explorers&#x27; journals they noted many symptoms of thiamine deficiency, so it is thought that they did not soak the nardoo long enough. Eventually thiamine deficiency could have led to their demise. It is noteworthy to mention that there are several other hypotheses regarding what may have killed Burke and Wills and it is widely disagreed upon by historians and scientists alike.

<text>Joseph Conrad is an iron-hulled sailing ship, originally launched as Georg Stage in 1882 and used to train sailors in Denmark. After sailing around the world as a private yacht in 1934 she served as a training ship in the United States, and is now a museum ship at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut.

==Service history==
Late one night in 1905 in Copenhagen during a fireworks display over the harbor the ships crew were ordered to shut down the lights, and most of the crew went down to their bunks to sleep. A larger merchant ship came into the direction of the ship, now completely black due to no lights, and so, it crashed and filled the bunks where the boys were sleeping, killing 22 boys the ages of 14 to 17. The ship was raised afterward. It was on guard during WWI but was more of a merchant ship and not even moved from the harbor.

Australian sailor and author Alan Villiers saved &quot;Georg Stage&quot; from the scrappers and renamed the ship in honor of famed sea author Joseph Conrad. Villiers planned a circumnavigation with a crew of mostly boys. &quot;Joseph Conrad&quot; sailed from Ipswich on 22 October 1934, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to New York City, then down to Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, and across the Indian Ocean and through the East Indies. After stops in Sydney, New Zealand, and Tahiti, &quot;Joseph Conrad&quot; rounded Cape Horn and returned to New York on 16 October 1936, having traveled a total of some .

Villiers was bankrupted as a result of the expedition (although he did get three books out of the episode - &quot;Cruise of the Conrad&quot;, &quot;Stormalong&quot;, and &quot;Joey Goes to Sea&quot;), and sold the ship to Huntington Hartford, heir to the A&amp;P supermarket fortune, who added an engine and used her as a yacht.

In 1939 Hartford donated &quot;Joseph Conrad&quot; to the United States Coast Guard for use as a training ship for the merchant marine based in Jacksonville, Florida. She participated in a training cruise through the Caribbean beginning in December, 1939 and sailed in the St. Petersburg to Havana Yacht Race in early 1941, a few months before the United States entered World War II. The Coast Guard turned the vessel over to the Maritime Administration when the merchant marine training functions of the Coast Guard were transferred to the newly created War Shipping Administration on September 1, 1942. &quot;Joseph Conrad&quot; continued to serve as a training ship until the war&#x27;s end in 1945.

After being laid up for two years, the ship was transferred to Mystic Seaport in Stonington, Connecticut on July 9, 1947, for &quot;museum and youth training purposes&quot;, where she has remained ever since as an exhibit. In addition to her role as a museum, she is also a static training vessel and is employed by Mystic Seaport to house campers attending the Joseph Conrad Sailing Camp.

<doc id="901090" wikidata="Q2713569" url="?curid=901090" title="Commander-in-Chief of the Forces">
<text>The Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, later Commander-in-Chief, British Army, or just the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), was (intermittently) the professional head of the English Army from 1660 to 1707 (the English Army, founded in 1645, was succeeded in 1707 by the new British Army, incorporating existing Scottish regiments) and of the British Army from 1707 until 1904. In 1904 the office was replaced with the creation of the Army Council and the appointment of Chief of the General Staff. 

==Republican origins==
In earlier times, supreme command of the Army had been exercised by the monarch in person. In 1645, after the outbreak of the English Civil War, Parliament appointed Thomas Fairfax &quot;Captain General and Commander-in-Chief of all the armies and forces raised and to be raised within the Commonwealth of England&quot;. Thomas Fairfax was the senior-most military officer, having no superior, and held great personal control over the army and its officers. Lord Fairfax was styled &quot;Lord General&quot;. None of his successors would use this title. In 1650, Fairfax resigned his post, shortly before the Scottish campaign of the War.

Oliver Cromwell, Fairfax&#x27;s Lieutenant-General, succeeded him as Commander-in-chief of the Forces. Under Cromwell, the Commander-in-Chief was &quot;de facto&quot; head of state, especially after the dismissal of the Long Parliament. Cromwell held the office until 1653, when he was elected Lord Protector.

On 21 February 1660, the reconstituted Long Parliament resolved &quot;that General George Monck be constituted and appointed Captain-General and Commander in Chief, under Parliament, of all the Land-Forces of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot;.

==Post-Restoration history==

After Monck&#x27;s death, the post, which gave the holder significant military power, was abolished until James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth successfully petitioned Charles II and was granted it in 1674. After Monmouth&#x27;s execution the post was again not filled until 1690, when it was bestowed upon John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, during the King&#x27;s absence in Ireland. It was likewise conferred on Meinhardt Schomberg, Duke of Schomberg the following year during the King&#x27;s absence in Flanders, Marlborough having fallen from favour.

After 1660 it became rare for British sovereigns to lead their troops in battle (with the notable exception of King William III); instead, it became normative for command (especially in time of war) to be delegated to an individual, who usually held the appointment of Captain General or Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. (In early years these two titles were often used interchangeably, and/or the appointments were held concurrently). The office was not always filled: for example, James II and William III both functioned themselves as Commander-in-Chief; at other times the appointment simply lapsed (especially if there was no perceived immediate military threat).

With the appointment of General Lord Amherst in 1793, the Commander-in-Chief was given authority over matters of discipline, over supplies, training and promotions in the British Army. The establishment of a military staff took place under the oversight of his successor, Frederick, Duke of York.

In most instances, Commanders-in-Chief of the Forces were not Cabinet members (only Conway and Wellington had a seat in Cabinet by virtue of holding this office; Ligonier and Granby were also in Cabinet during their time in office, but in both cases sat as Master-General of the Ordnance). Instead, the British Army was represented variously and tenuously in government by the Paymaster of the Forces (Paymaster General from 1836), the Master-General of the Ordnance (who did not invariably have a seat in Cabinet), the Secretary at War (who was not usually a member of the Cabinet) and (from 1794) the Secretary of State for War.

With the demise of the Board of Ordnance in the wake of the Crimean War the Commander-in-Chief assumed command of the Ordnance troops: the Royal Regiment of Artillery and the Corps of Royal Engineers. The momentum of reform at this time, however, was toward increasing the authority of the Secretary of State for War. From the passing of the War Office Act 1870, as part of the Cardwell Reforms, the Commander-in-Chief was made clearly subordinate to the Secretary of State, to serve as the latter&#x27;s principal military adviser, and was made to move out of his traditional office above the arch at Horse Guards and into the War Office. Nevertheless, in 1888 he is still described as having responsibility for all personnel and matériel issues for the army and auxiliary forces, and in 1895 he took on the responsibilities of chief of staff.

The appointment of Commander-in-Chief remained in the personal gift of the monarch, and its independence was guarded by Queen Victoria (among others) as emblematic of the notion that command of the Army was vested in the Crown; during her reign, however, the office was (in 1870) made much more clearly subordinate to the Secretary of State for War (and to Parliament).

Following the recommendations of the Esher Report, the office was replaced in 1904 with the creation of the Army Council and the appointment of Chief of the General Staff. The title reverted to the monarch, who remains (titular) &quot;Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces&quot;.

==The Forces==
The British military (ie., that part of the armed forces committed to land warfare, and not to be confused with the naval forces) was originally made up of several forces, including the British Army, the others being: the Ordnance Military Corps of the Board of Ordnance (including the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and Royal Sappers and Miners), being a professional, or &quot;regular&quot; force like the army); the Militia Force (or &quot;Constitutional Force&quot;), being a conscripted reserve infantry force able to be called out in times of emergency for home defence; the Yeomanry, being a similar mounted force; and the Volunteer Corps, made up of voluntary reserve units that normally only existed during wartime. The Board of Ordnance was abolished in 1855 and its military corps, commissariat stores, transport, barracks and other departments were absorbed into the British Army, which was also called &quot;Regular Force&quot; or &quot;Regular Army&quot;). The &quot;Reserve Forces&quot; were also known as the &quot;Auxiliary Forces&quot; and the &quot;Local Forces&quot; (as their personnel could not originally be compelled to serve outside their local areas), and were re-organised in the 1850s with the Militia becoming voluntary (but with recruits engaging for a period of service that they were obliged to complete), and the Volunteer Force permanently established. These forces were increasingly integrated with the British Army during the final decades of the Nineteenth Century and the first decades of the Twentieth Century. The Yeomanry and Volunteer Force became the Territorial Force in 1908, and the Militia became the Special Reserve (and ceased to exist after the First World War).

<doc id="901091" wikidata="Q29145" url="?curid=901091" title="Sodium triphosphate">
<text>Sodium triphosphate (STP), also sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), or tripolyphosphate (TPP),) is an inorganic compound with formula Na5P3O10. It is the sodium salt of the polyphosphate penta-anion, which is the conjugate base of triphosphoric acid. It is produced on a large scale as a component of many domestic and industrial products, especially detergents. Environmental problems associated with eutrophication are attributed to its widespread use.

==Preparation and properties==
Sodium tripolyphosphate is produced by heating a stoichiometric mixture of disodium phosphate, Na2HPO4, and monosodium phosphate, NaH2PO4, under carefully controlled conditions.
:2 Na2HPO4 + NaH2PO4 → Na5P3O10 + 2 H2O
In this way, approximately 2 million tons are produced annually.

STPP is a colourless salt, which exists both in anhydrous form and as the hexahydrate. The anion can be described as the pentanionic chain [O3POP(O)2OPO3]5−. Many related di-, tri-, and polyphosphates are known including the cyclic triphosphate (e.g. sodium trimetaphosphate). It binds strongly to metal cations as both a bidentate and tridentate chelating agent.
==Uses==

===Detergents===
The majority of STPP is consumed as a component of commercial detergents. It serves as a &quot;builder&quot;, industrial jargon for a water softener. In hard water (water that contains high concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+), detergents are deactivated. Being a highly charged chelating agent, TPP5− binds to dications tightly and prevents them from interfering with the sulfonate detergent.

===Food===
STPP is a preservative for seafood, meats, poultry, and animal feeds. It is common in food production as E number E451. In foods, STPP is used as an emulsifier and to retain moisture. Many governments regulate the quantities allowed in foods, as it can substantially increase the sale weight of seafood in particular. The United States Food and Drug Administration lists STPP as Generally recognized as safe.

===Other===
Other uses (hundreds of thousands of tons/year) include ceramics (decrease the viscosity of glazes up to a certain limit), leather tanning (as masking agent and synthetic tanning agent - SYNTAN), anticaking agents, setting retarders, flame retardants, paper, anticorrosion pigments, textiles, rubber manufacture, fermentation, antifreeze.&quot; TPP is used as a polyanion crosslinker in polysaccharide based drug delivery. Toothpaste may contain sodium triphosphate.

==Health effects==
High serum phosphate concentration has been identified as a predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality. Whilst phosphate is present in the body and food in organic forms, inorganic forms of phosphate such as sodium triphosphate are readily adsorbed and can result in elevated phosphate levels in serum. Salts of polyphosphate anions are moderately irritating to skin and mucous membranes because they are mildly alkaline.

==Environmental effects==
Because it is very water-soluble, STPP is not significantly removed by waste water treatment. STPP hydrolyses to phosphate, which is assimilated into the natural phosphorus cycle. Detergents containing phosphorus contribute to the eutrophication of many fresh waters.

<text>Phosphorescent is the stage name of American singer-songwriter Matthew Houck. Originally from Huntsville, Alabama, Houck began recording and performing under this nickname in 2001 in Athens, Georgia. He is currently based in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Overview==
Before recording under the name Phosphorescent, Matthew Houck toured under the name Fillup Shack and self-released a limited pressing of the album &quot;Hipolit&quot; in 2000. Houck later changed his stage name to Phosphorescent and released the full-length LP &quot;A Hundred Times or More&quot; in 2003 through Athens, Georgia-based independent label Warm Records. The following year, he released the EP &quot;The Weight of Flight&quot;. Phosphorescent rose to wider critical acclaim after releasing &quot;Aw Come Aw Wry&quot; in August 2005 and &quot;Pride&quot; in October 2007. The latter was named the 12th best album of 2007 by &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; and received an 8.0 rating from the online indie magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. In 2009, inspired by Willie Nelson&#x27;s tribute album to Lefty Frizzell &quot;To Lefty from Willie&quot;, Houck crafted a tribute album to Nelson himself entitled &quot;To Willie&quot;, released through Dead Oceans. Phosphorescent released &quot;Here&#x27;s to Taking It Easy&quot; in 2010.

&quot;Muchacho&quot;, Phosphorescent&#x27;s sixth studio album, was released in 2013 to critical acclaim. The full studio album &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot; followed in 2018.

In January 2024, Phosphorescent announced his new album &quot;Revelator&quot;, to be released in April on Verve Records. For the first time, it features a song written by someone other than Houck - his partner and collaborator, Jo Schornikow.

<doc id="901100" wikidata="Q7196575" url="?curid=901100" title="Pinwheel (TV series)">
<text>Pinwheel is an American children&#x27;s television series that was the first show to air on the then-rebranded Nickelodeon, as well as the first to appear on its Nick Jr. block along reruns until 1990. The show was aimed at preschoolers aged 2–5. It was created by Vivian Horner, an educator who spent her earlier career at the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, the company behind PBS&#x27;s &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The show was geared to the &quot;short attention span of preschoolers,&quot; with each episode divided into short, self-contained segments including songs, skits, and animations from all over the world.

The series is set in a boarding house called Pinwheel House, which is powered by a pinwheel on the roof. The house&#x27;s residents are a mix of live-action humans and puppets. Most of the show&#x27;s songs are set to music in the style of a wind-up music box.

&quot;Pinwheel&quot; premiered on December 1, 1977, on Channel C-3 of QUBE&#x27;s local cable system in Columbus, Ohio. In April 1979, Channel C-3 expanded into a national television network, now rebranded Nickelodeon. &quot;Pinwheel&quot; continued to air on the network until 1990, and exclusively during the then-new Nick Jr. block starting in 1988. It was gradually phased out in favor of another preschool series, &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; a successor series to &quot;Pinwheel&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Pinwheel&quot; was created by Vivian Horner and produced by Sandy Kavanaugh, two educators who had previously worked at the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop. The show was created for QUBE, a local cable system tested in Columbus, Ohio. QUBE&#x27;s developers wanted to offer a series for preschoolers, so they hired Horner and Kavanaugh based on their previous experience in preschool television. Starting in December 1, 1977, &quot;Pinwheel&quot; was shown on Channel C-3, one of the experimental channels offered to QUBE subscribers. The channel was cited as &quot;the world&#x27;s first TV channel geared strictly to preschoolers.&quot;

In 1979, Pinwheel was expanded into a national network rebranded Nickelodeon (now part of Paramount). &quot;Pinwheel&quot; was reformatted as a series of hour-long episodes shown in three- to five-hour blocks, a format which eventually became the model for Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block. There were a total of 260 &quot;Pinwheel&quot; episodes recorded from 1977 to 1984. For international distribution, Nickelodeon edited &quot;Pinwheel&quot; into a package of half-hour episodes. It aired in Canada on Superchannel (from 1983 to 1988) and TVOntario (from 1990 to 1993). The series was also broadcast in the UK whereas it aired on the defunct children&#x27;s cable and satellite television network The Children&#x27;s Channel from 1985-1987 and was even shown in a few Eurasian countries, including Channel 5 in Singapore, TV1 and TV2 in Malaysia and ATV World in Hong Kong as part of their afternoon children&#x27;s programming block &quot;Tube Time&quot;.

On January 4, 1988, Nickelodeon introduced the Nick Jr. block, a weekday morning block for preschoolers, to its schedule. &quot;Pinwheel&quot; was the first series that aired as part of the block. &quot;Pinwheel&quot; continued to air as a staple of Nick Jr. until July 6, 1990, when the show aired its last rerun. Another puppet series for preschoolers, &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot;, was made to replace it. In an article titled &quot;Nickelodeon&#x27;s New Lineup for Preschoolers,&quot; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; the successor to &quot;Pinwheel&quot;.

==Premise==

The show takes place in and around a large Victorian-style boarding house called Pinwheel House, which is powered by a pinwheel on one of the peaks. Live action casting interact with puppets, discussing several concepts familiar to children&#x27;s programming like sharing, being considerate, the environment, and colors. All of the characters live and work in the various areas in and around the house. The Ohio episodes relied heavily on songs mostly performed by Jake. A package of children&#x27;s shorts from Coe Film Associates were shown as inserts between the show&#x27;s usual puppet/human segments.

&quot;Pinwheel&quot; underwent several changes when it moved to national television in 1979. Taping of &quot;Pinwheel&quot; moved to Matrix Studios in New York City, where the set was rebuilt. Arline Miyazaki, Betty Rozek, and Dale Engel joined the cast as Kim, Sal, and Smitty. Craig Marin and Olga Felgemacher created new puppet characters. Coe Film Associates&#x27; collection of short films were also used as inserts for other early Nickelodeon shows, including &quot;Hocus Focus&quot; and &quot;By the Way&quot;.

==Characters==
===Humans===
The characters are ordered per the first season credits, with later cast members added to the end.
* Franci (Franci Anderson) - a storyteller who likes to write and perform in plays. She keeps a terrarium that houses a group of small alien marionettes called the Wonkles. She likes to sketch pictures as she tells stories. She only appeared in the first season.
* Coco (Caroline Cox Loveheart from 1977 to 1979, Lindanell Rivera from 1979 to 1984) - a Parisian mime who never speaks and has a knack for fixing things. She often hosts her own segments, performing magic tricks and mime routines while an off-screen narrator describes her actions.
* Jake (George James) - an African-American boarder who enjoys music. He collects unusual sounds in small boxes and opens them up whenever he needs musical inspiration. He keeps a wide variety of musical instruments in his room, and he displays them unconventionally on a coatrack.
* Smitty (Dale Engle) and Sal (Betty Rozek) - an elderly couple who run a local newspaper called &quot;The Daily Noodle&quot;. One of Smitty&#x27;s long-running obsessions is to capture a photograph of the elusive Admiral Bird for the front page of the &quot;Daily Noodle&quot;, though he constantly misses his chance.
* Kim (Arline Miyazaki) - Aurelia&#x27;s Asian niece who is the resident artist of Pinwheel House. She is commonly seen wearing a painter&#x27;s smock and carrying a painting palette. In addition to painting, she sometimes makes sculptures.

===Puppets===
* Aurelia - a bohemian-style character who is the owner and mother figure of Pinwheel House. She has a ginger bob, olive green eyes, fuchsia lips and wears colorful headscarfs and large hoop earrings. She is friendly and bubbly, but firm and sometimes full of herself. She works as a fortune teller and has a touch-tone crystal ball that works like a telephone.
* Ebenezer T. Squint - a green-skinned inventor and part-time magician who talks in a nasal voice. He lives in a basement storage room where he makes machines and conspires to be featured in Smitty&#x27;s newspaper. He pretends to be antisocial, but he secretly enjoys being included in the house activities. In his words, he loves to play as &quot;the villain&quot; and cause trouble for no good reason. He has collections of dust and weeds.
* Luigi O&#x27;Brien - an Italian produce vendor who runs a small food stand in the backyard of the boarding house. He has a happy-go-lucky, relaxed attitude and is often a source of advice. All of his produce items talk, sing, and have individual personalities, but they are only known by their respective fruit and vegetable names (Pear, Tomato, etc.).
* Plus and Minus (voiced by Jinkins and unknown) - Aurelia&#x27;s twin nephews who live in the attic room. The color schemes for the twins were the exact opposite, with Plus having black hair and orange skin and Minus with white hair and purple skin. Minus is very upbeat and enthusiastic, while Plus is more thoughtful and easily discouraged. A recurring sketch is Plus&#x27;s attempt to board a spaceship to the moon, and Minus distracting him and causing him to miss the take-off. Their favorite game is &quot;Gotcha Last,&quot; a combination of tag and hide-and-seek.
* Molly the Mole - an elderly mole who lives in a tree in the backyard and often introduces cartoon shorts in the form of telling stories. She is sometimes visited by another mole named Leo.
* The Admiral Bird - a bright red bird marionette who is known for being elusive and hard to catch. He often drops from the sky with a strange, echoing call. It is Smitty&#x27;s dream to capture a picture of the Admiral Bird for his newspaper, but he never succeeds. The Admiral Bird enjoys teasing Smitty.
* Silas the Snail - an elderly snail who is constantly on his way to an annual snail gathering. He never makes it further than the back garden due to snails being so slow. He extolls the virtues of slowing down and enjoying life, telling people that &quot;half the fun is getting there.&quot;
* The Hobo Bugs - a brother-and-sister pair of marionettes named Herbert and Lulu. They like to dance and play on the hedges in the backyard, and they often visit Luigi&#x27;s produce stand to ask for special items, such as an impossible pair of custom sandals that Luigi somehow manages to produce. They also love to play with Ebenezer, who typically tells them to leave him alone in a grumpy manner, even though he really enjoys their company.
* The Wonkles - a group of alien marionettes from the planet Zintar who live in Franci&#x27;s garden terrarium. Three of them are bird-like: Tika (yellow and pink), Gorkle (blue), and Woofle (red). A fourth Wonkle, an abstract-looking green creature named Sorbin, also visits occasionally. They were retired from the show along with Franci and Spiderbelle in 1979.
* Spiderbelle - a purple spider marionette who wears a bonnet. She was retired from the show along with Franci and the Wonkles in 1979.

==List of shorts==
Nickelodeon secured the rights to a number of international short segments (usually acquired from Coe Film Associates), including those that were already written in English, such as the Franco-British children&#x27;s show &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. &quot;Pinwheel&quot; became a showcase for these acquisitions and featured a wide variety of both animated and stop-motion animation shorts or cartoons from each different country such as Europe.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Pinwheel&quot; had &quot;attracted praise from critics,&quot; and &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; called the show a &quot;highly acclaimed Nickelodeon cable series for preschoolers.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1982, Alexis Greene commended &quot;Pinwheel&quot; for catering specifically to preschoolers and called the show &quot;a colorful, well-written mix of songs and skits, puppets and &#x27;real people.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Christopher John Brennan (1 November 1870 – 5 October 1932) was an Australian poet, scholar and literary critic.

==Biography==
Brennan was born in Haymarket, an inner suburb of Sydney, to Christopher Brennan (d. 1919), a brewer, and his wife Mary Ann &quot;née&quot; Carroll (d. 1924), both Irish immigrants. His education took place at two schools in Sydney: he first attended St Aloysius&#x27; College, and after gaining a scholarship from Patrick Moran, he boarded at St Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview.

Brennan entered the University of Sydney in 1888, taking up studies in the Classics, and won a travelling scholarship to Berlin. There he met his future wife, Anna Elisabeth Werth; there, also, he encountered the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. About this time, he decided to become a poet. In 1893 Brennan&#x27;s article &quot;On the Manuscripts of Aeschylus&quot; appeared in &quot;The Journal of Philology&quot;. Brennan began forming a theory about the descent of Aeschylus&#x27; extant manuscripts in 1888.

Returning to Australia, Brennan took up a position as a cataloguer in the public library, before being given a position as assistant lecturer in French and German in the department of modern languages and literature and in 1920 the position of associate professor in German and comparative literature at the University of Sydney. In 1914, he produced his major work, &quot;Poems: 1913&quot;.

After Brennan&#x27;s marriage broke up in 1922, he went to live with Violet Singer, the &#x27;Vie&#x27; of his later poems, and, as a result of both his divorce and increasing drunkenness, he was removed from his position at the university in June 1925. The death of Singer in an accident in the same year left him distraught, and he spent most of his remaining years in poverty. Brennan died in 1932 from cancer.

==Legacy==
Brennan influenced Australian writers of his own generation and many who succeeded him, including R. D. Fitzgerald, A. D. Hope, Judith Wright and James McAuley. In remembrance, the Fellowship of Australian Writers established the Christopher Brennan Award which is presented annually to &quot;an Australian poet who has written work of sustained quality and distinction&quot;.

Brennan Hall and Library at St John&#x27;s College within the University of Sydney, the Christopher Brennan building in the university&#x27;s Arts Faculty, and the main library at Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview are named in his honour.

There was for several decades a Christopher Brennan Society &quot;founded in... the 1970s by Axel Clark, Robin Marsden and John Fletcher&quot;, whose patrons included &quot;some who knew Brennan: Professor A. R. Chisholm; Margaret Delmer; Professor Ralph Farrell; Sister Peter, of the Sisters of Charity; Walter Stone; Professor G. P. Shipp; Richard Pennington&quot;.

<text>The North America and West Indies Station was a formation or command of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy stationed in North American waters from 1745 to 1956, with main bases at the Imperial fortresses of Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The North American Station absorbed the separate Newfoundland Station in 1825 (becoming the North America and Newfoundland Station), and the Jamaica Station in 1830, to form the North America and West Indies Station. It was briefly abolished in 1907 before being restored in 1915. It was renamed the America and West Indies Station in 1926, absorbing what had been the South East Coast of America Station and the Pacific Station. It was commanded by Commanders-in-Chief whose titles changed with the changing of the formation&#x27;s name, eventually by the Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Station.

==History==
The squadron was formed in 1745 to counter French forces in North America, with the headquarters at the Halifax Naval Yard in Nova Scotia (now CFB Halifax).

Royal Navy ships and vessels in the area had been designated as the &quot;North American Station&quot; in 1767, under the command of Commodore Samuel Hood. The headquarters was located in Halifax from 1758 to 1794, and thereafter in Halifax and Bermuda. Land and buildings for a permanent Naval Yard were purchased by the Royal Navy in 1758 and the Yard was officially commissioned in 1759. The Yard served as the main base for the Royal Navy in North America during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the American Revolution, and the French Revolutionary Wars.

The economy of Bermuda had been entirely dependent on maritime activities, including privateering, since the 17th Century.

Following American independence in 1783, Bermuda was the only British territory left between Nova Scotia and the West Indies (by agreement with the Spanish government, a Royal Navy base was maintained in Florida until this was ceded to the United States), and was selected as the new headquarters for the region. The establishment of a base there was delayed for a dozen years, however, due to the need to survey the encircling barrier reef to locate channels suitable for large warships. Once this had been completed, a base was established at St. George&#x27;s in 1794, with the fleet anchoring at &quot;Murray&#x27;s Anchorage&quot; in the northern lagoon, named for Vice Admiral Sir George Murray, who became the Commander-in-Chief of the new &quot;River St. Lawrence and Coast of America and North America and West Indies Station&quot;. The Admiralty also began purchasing land at Bermuda&#x27;s West End, including Ireland Island, Spanish Point, and smaller islands in the Great Sound with the intent of building the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, and a permanent naval base there, with its anchorage on &quot;Grassy Bay&quot;. The construction of this base was to drag on through much of the Nineteenth Century.



Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren was appointed Commander-in-Chief in 1812, and he and his staff seem to have spent most of their time at Bermuda during the War of 1812 (he was replaced by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane in 1813), from where the blockade of much of the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States and raids such as the Battle of Craney Island were orchestrated. 2,500 soldiers under Major-General Robert Ross aboard , three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels, was sent to Bermuda in 1814, following British victory in the Peninsular War, and joined with the naval and military forces already at, or operating from, Bermuda to carry out the Chesapeake campaign, a punitive expedition which included the Raid on Alexandria, the Battle of Bladensburg, and the Burning of Washington was launched in August, 1814.

In 1813, the area of command had become the &quot;North America Station&quot; again, with the West Indies falling under the Jamaica Station, and in 1816 it was renamed the &quot;North America and Lakes of Canada Station&quot;. The headquarters was initially in Bermuda during the winter and Halifax during the summer, but Admiralty House, Bermuda, became the year-round headquarters of the station in 1821, when the area of command became the &quot;North America and Newfoundland Station&quot; (with the absorption of the Newfoundland Station). In 1818 Halifax became the summer base for the squadron which shifted to the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, for the remainder of the year. In 1819, Bermuda, which was better positioned to counter threats from the United States, became the main base of the station year-round. Halifax continued to be used as the summer base for the station until 1907. Virtually impregnable to attack over the ocean, and impossible to attack over land, Bermuda&#x27;s importance following the war was described by Royal Naval Purser Richard Cotter in 1828:

Sir Henry Hardinge reported, in the House of Commons, on the 22 March 1839:



In 1830 the station absorbed the Jamaica Station and was redesignated as the &quot;North America and West Indies Station&quot;, and remained so until 1907, when the North America and West Indies Station was abolished and its squadron replaced by the 4th Cruiser Squadron. This was based in England and Bermuda was redesignated from a base to a coaling station, although the dockyard remained in operation. The Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station, remained in Bermuda. The Royal Navy withdrew from Halifax in 1905, and the Halifax Naval Yard was handed over to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1910. The Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard on the Pacific coast of Canada was also transferred to the dominion government in 1905.

An official letter sent by the Commander-in-Chief during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903 listed the following ships at the station on 1 January 1903: cruisers HMS &quot;Ariadne&quot;, HMS &quot;Charybdis&quot;, HMS &quot;Pallas&quot;, HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, HMS &quot;Retribution&quot;, and HMS &quot;Tribune&quot;; sloops HMS &quot;Fantome&quot; and HMS &quot;Alert&quot;; destroyers HMS &quot;Quail&quot; and HMS &quot;Rocket&quot;; and the tender HMS &quot;Columbine&quot;. 
The North America and West Indies Station was restored in 1915, and incorporated the 8th Cruiser Squadron from 1924 to 1925. After the First World War, relying on the Panama Canal (completed in 1914), it absorbed the geographic area formerly belonging to the Pacific Station, as reported in the Daily Colonist newspaper on 16 July, 1919:

and, in 1928, South America (what had once been the South East Coast of America Station) was added to the geographic limits of the North America and West Indies Station and the station was renamed the &quot;America and West Indies Station&quot;. In May, 1928, was recommissioned and transferred to the Station from the Mediterranean to augment the vessels of the 8th Light Cruiser Station. South American waters had previously been patrolled by the &quot;South American Squadron&quot;, but this had been withdrawn due to financial constraints in 1921, since when the British flag has been shown there only by special visits (such as during the world cruise of the First Cruiser Squadron in 1924 or by HMS Repulse during the March to October, 1925, tour of Africa and South America by the Prince of Wales&#x27;), or by detaching a ship from the North America and West Indies Station. In 1942 the title of C-in-C America and West Indies was re-styled &quot;Senior British Naval Officer, Western Atlantic&quot;.

In 1945 the &quot;America and West Indies&quot; title was restored.

In 1951, the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, was reduced to a base without drydock facilities, with the Admiralty Floating Dock No. 5 towed to Britain by HM Tugs &quot;Warden&quot; and &quot;Reward&quot; (the smaller AFD 48 remained). The position of Senior Naval Officer West Indies (SNOWI) was established as a Sub-Area Commander under the Commander-in-Chief of the America and West Indies station. The occupant of this position was a commodore, and was provided with a shore office on Ireland Island (which was beside the Victualling Yard until 1962), but was required to spend much of his time at sea in the West Indies. A flagship (between 1951 and April, 1956, this was successively , , HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;, ) and other vessels of the America and West Indies Squadron continued to be based at the South Yard of the former Royal Naval Dockyard, where the Royal Navy maintained a &quot;Berthing Area&quot; under the command of a Resident Naval Officer (RNO), but were detached from the Home Fleet, and their refits and repairs were thenceforth to be carried out in Britain. The RNO had his own office in one of the houses of Dockyard Terrace. Admiralty land not required for the continued naval operations was sold to the colonial government. There was also an RNO in Nassau.

In 1952, the Commander-in-Chief, Vice Admiral Sir William Andrewes, became the initial Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic.

==Disestablishment and successor, SNOWI==
On 29 October 1956, the post of Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Station, was abolished, leaving the Senior Naval Officer, West Indies as his replacement. SNOWI reported directly to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, flying his flag back in the United Kingdom. SNOWI also served as Island Commander Bermuda (ISCOMBERMUDA) in the NATO chain of command, reporting to Commander-in-Chief, Western Atlantic Area, as part of SACLANT. The ships of the command were reduced to two Station Frigates.

All remaining Admiralty land, including Admiralty House at Clarence Hill and Ireland Island, along with War Department lands in Bermuda, were sold to the colonial government between 1957 and 1965. That part of the dockyard still required for naval operations remained under Admiralty control under a ninety-nine year lease as the South Yard Berthing Area, which was commissioned on 1 June 1965 as , under the command of the RNO, with the headquarters of SNOWI and the RNO in Moresby House (originally built in the 1899s as the residence of the civilian Officer in Charge, Works). In December, 1967, the position of RNO Bermuda was abolished, with its duties passing to SNOWI&#x27;s secretary and SNOWI taking over command of HMS &quot;Malabar&quot;. As SNOWI was frequently in the West Indies, he was unable to effectively command HMS &quot;Malabar&quot; and a Lieutenant-Commander was consequently appointed to the roles of Commanding Officer of HMS &quot;Malabar&quot; and RNO in 1971.

The former Royal Naval wireless station land at Daniels Head was leased to the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 January 1963, for the purpose of a new radio station. It became CFS Daniel&#x27;s Head when the Royal Canadian Navy became part of the Canadian Forces in 1969.

After the assassination of the Governor of Bermuda, Sir Richard Sharples, in February 1973, provided enhanced security for Commodore Cameron Rusby, the then-SNOWI. A detachment of Royal Marines (subsequently replaced by soldiers from the Parachute Regiment) was posted to the Dockyard to guard SNOWI.

While Bermuda had been the ideal base of operations for the North America and West Indies Station, at a thousand miles north of the Virgin Islands, it was far too distant to serve as an effective headquarters for only the West Indies. This meant that both SNOWI and the Station Frigates spent little time in or near Bermuda. On 1 April 1976, the post of SNOWI was abolished, and the Station Frigates were withdrawn. The RNO and his staff remained, and a frigate was appointed West Indies Guardship, but seldom visited Bermuda. HMS &quot;Malabar&quot; ceased to be a base and was rated only as a supply station.

By 1995, when &quot;Malabar&quot; was handed over to the Government of Bermuda, the Royal Naval presence in the North-Western Atlantic and Caribbean had been reduced to only the West Indies Guard Ship, a role which was rotated among the fleet&#x27;s escorts, which took turns operating extended patrols of the West Indies.

Years after the disestablishment of the SNOWI post, the West Indies Guard Ship task was redesignated Atlantic Patrol Task (North).

<text>Philip John Keoghan ( ; born 31 May 1967) is a New Zealand television personality, best known for hosting the American version of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; on CBS, since its 2001 debut. He is the creator and host of &quot;No Opportunity Wasted&quot;, which has been produced in the United States, New Zealand, and Canada. Keoghan also co-created and hosts the American reality competition programme &quot;Tough as Nails,&quot; which debuted on CBS on 8 July 2020. As of 2021, he has been involved with winning 10 Primetime Emmy Awards related to his work on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, where the show consecutively won the Outstanding Reality-Competition Program seven times.

==Early life==
Keoghan was born in Lincoln, a satellite town of Christchurch, New Zealand. Due to his father&#x27;s career, Keoghan spent a considerable part of his childhood in Antigua and Canada. His family had returned to Christchurch by the time he was in high school, and following that, Keoghan attended St Andrew&#x27;s College, Christchurch.

==Television==

While completing a TV cameraman apprenticeship, Keoghan successfully auditioned for the New Zealand children&#x27;s show &quot;Spot On&quot; at age 19. After a series of further presenter work in New Zealand television, including as a reporter on &quot;That&#x27;s Fairly Interesting&quot;, he, at 23, and his wife Louise left for the United States after his show &quot;Keoghan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was picked up by a U.S. network.

Keoghan originally auditioned for the host of &quot;Survivor&quot;. Though he made the shortlist, the CBS network ultimately chose Jeff Probst for &quot;Survivor&quot;, and offered Keoghan the hosting duties for &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Keoghan has been host for the show from its inception and also serves as a producer. He currently has a contract extending for &quot;several years&quot; following &quot;The Amazing Race 18&quot; in 2011 that will allow him to also develop other shows for CBS. In a 2002 interview, Keoghan admitted that his pay for a single episode of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; is more than an entire year on &quot;Spot On&quot;.

Shortly after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Keoghan visited his hometown to ensure his family was safe but also to record segments for &quot;The Early Show&quot; to implore viewers to provide aid to the New Zealand Red Cross and to promote continued tourism, a fundamental part of New Zealand&#x27;s economy, to the country. At the same time, he participated in recording Air New Zealand&#x27;s new safety video for its domestic jet fleet. Keoghan has hosted over 1,000 different programme episodes.

In June 2010, it was announced that Keoghan would host and produce a new reality series about the Velux 5 Oceans Race. 

Keoghan told TMZ in 2010 that during the 10th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; he was detained in Ukraine for two days until the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine intervened to free him.

Keoghan hosted &quot;National Geographic Explorer&quot; starting in the show&#x27;s 11th season, to start airing in 2018. According to Keoghan, he had wanted to produce for &quot;Explorer&quot; and he and his wife-to-be had even filmed and submitted a pitch tape to the show&#x27;s production at that time.

==&quot;No Opportunity Wasted&quot;==
While 19 and filming for &quot;Spot On&quot;, Keoghan and a partner dived down to the shipwreck of the &quot;MS Mikhail Lermontov&quot;, underwater. During filming, he was separated from his partner in the ship&#x27;s ballroom and suffered a panic attack, considering it a near-death experience. He was rescued by his dive partner, and though shaken, insisted on facing his fear and returned the next day to complete filming. From then on, Keoghan set out to live his life to the fullest by accomplishing exotic goals and taking risks, creating a &quot;No Opportunity Wasted&quot; (NOW) list of activities he wanted to complete in his life; In his book &quot;No Opportunity Wasted&quot;, Keoghan wrote:

Since then, Keoghan has broken a world bungee jumping record, gone diving in the world&#x27;s longest underwater caves, eaten a meal on top of an erupting volcano, and renewed his vows underwater while feeding sharks. He was a guest on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, where he shared with Oprah his list of things he wants to do before he dies. 

Keoghan co-developed the television show &quot;No Opportunity Wasted&quot;, initially premiering in 2004, that reflected on this &quot;No Opportunity Wasted&quot; mantra. He also wrote a companion book, &quot;No Opportunity Wasted: 8 Ways to Create a List for the Life You Want&quot;.

==Cycling==
Keoghan is an avid cyclist. From 28 March to 9 May 2009, Keoghan performed in &quot;Ride Across America&quot;, in partnership with several organisations including GNC, to raise money for multiple sclerosis research. Keoghan and others biked from Los Angeles to New York City, averaging per day. Keoghan stopped in 39 cities en route, attending various events and participating in casting for season 15 of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;; the ride culminated a day before the finale of season 14. The event raised $500,000, with over $400,000 coming from in-store donations during the ride. His documentary movie &quot;The Ride&quot; about his ride across America, premiered on 3 February 2011.

Keoghan later came across information about Harry Watson, an early-20th-century New Zealand cyclist that formed a team of four to become the first English-speaking team to ride in the Tour de France in 1928. Looking to celebrate Watson&#x27;s legacy, Keoghan prepared to ride the same Tour de France course from 1928 (then, 22 legs at nearly compared to the modern Tour at ), using the same type of gear-less bicycle as Watson and his team used, outside of using a modern riding seat. He and his riding partner Ben Cornell completed the ride in 2013, with their progress filmed by Keoghan&#x27;s wife Louise and others. The footage was assembled for another film called &quot;Le Ride&quot;, which premiered in the Isaac Theatre Royal in Christchurch at the New Zealand Film Festival in July 2016.

==Personal life==
Keoghan&#x27;s father, John, is an agricultural scientist involved with conservation in New Zealand. He appeared alongside his son as a Pit Stop greeter during the 13th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; when the racers stopped in New Zealand. John Keoghan and his wife run a bed and breakfast in Rolleston, New Zealand.

Keoghan&#x27;s brother Andrew was a television reporter on Television New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;One News&quot; and is a jazz singer. His sister, Ruth Keoghan Cooper, specialises in coaching, training and development programmes for professional women who wish to combine careers with motherhood.

Keoghan currently lives with his wife and producing partner Louise Keoghan (née Rodrigues), and their daughter. Louise is an Australian-born television producer and director and co-creator of &quot;No Opportunity Wasted&quot; and &quot;Tough as Nails&quot;. They currently reside in Los Angeles, California. They also have homes in Matarangi on the Coromandel Peninsula, and in Westport.

<text>Ujjain (, , old name Avantika, ) or Ujjayinī is a city in Ujjain district of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is the fifth-largest city in Madhya Pradesh by population and is the administrative centre of Ujjain district and Ujjain division. It is one of the Hindu pilgrimage centres of Sapta Puri famous for the &quot;Kumbh Mela&quot; (Simhastha) held there every 12 years. The famous temple of Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga is located in the center of the city. The city has been one of the most prominent trade and political centres of the Indian Subcontinent from the time of the ancient Mahājanapadas until the British colonisation of India.

An ancient city situated on the eastern bank of the Shipra River, Ujjain was the most prominent city on the Malwa plateau of central India for much of its history. It emerged as the political centre of central India around 600 BCE. It was the capital of the ancient Avanti kingdom, one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas. During the 18th century, the city briefly became the capital of the Scindia state of the Maratha Confederacy, when Ranoji Scindia established his capital at Ujjain in 1731. It remained an important political, commercial, and cultural centre of Central India until the early 19th century, when the British administrators decided to develop Indore as an alternative to it. Ujjain continues to be an important place of pilgrimage for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Shaktas. Bathing in the holy Shipra river of Ujjain liberates one from sins. Therefore, Ujjain is also called the &#x27;Mokshadayini city&#x27;. The name of this river is taken among the holy rivers like Kaveri, Narmada, Godavari and Krishna.

According to Puranic legend, Ujjain, along with Haridwar, Nashik, and Prayag, is one of four sites where drops of &quot;amrita&quot;, the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from a &quot;kumbha&quot; (pitcher) while being carried by the celestial bird Garuda during the &quot;Samudra Manthana&quot;, or the churning of the ocean of milk.

Ujjain has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s flagship Smart Cities Mission.

==History==

=== Prehistoric era ===

Excavations at Kayatha (around 26 km from Ujjain) have revealed Chalcolithic agricultural settlements dating to around 2000 BCE. Chalcolithic sites have also been discovered at other areas around Ujjain, including Nagda, but excavations at Ujjain itself have not revealed any Chalcolithic settlements. Archaeologist H. D. Sankalia theorised that the Chalcolithic settlements at Ujjain were probably destroyed by the Iron Age settlers.

According to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, Avanti, whose capital was Ujjain, &quot;was one of the earliest outposts in central India&quot; and showed signs of early incipient urbanisation around 700 BCE. Around 600 BCE, Ujjain emerged as the political, Commercial, and cultural centre of Malwa plateau.

The ancient walled city of Ujjain was located around the Garh Kalika hill on the bank of the river Kshipra, in the present-day suburban areas of the Ujjain city. This city covered an irregular pentagonal area of 0.875 km2. It was surrounded by a 12 m high mud rampart. The archaeological investigations have also indicated the presence of a 45 meter wide and 6.6 m deep moat around the city. According to F. R. Allchin and George Erdosy, these city defences were constructed between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE. Dieter Schlingloff believes that these were built before 600 BCE. This period is characterised by structures made of stone and burnt-brick, tools and weapons made of iron, and black and red burnished ware.

According to the Puranic texts, a branch of the legendary Haihaya dynasty ruled over Ujjain.

=== Ancient period ===

In the 4th century BCE, the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta annexed Avanti to his empire. Mauryan founded the City of Ujjain. The edicts of his grandson Ashoka mention four provinces of the Mauryan empire, of which Ujjain was the capital of the Western province. During the reign of his father Bindusara, Ashoka served as the viceroy of Ujjain, which highlights the importance of the town. As the viceroy of Ujjain, Ashoka married Devi, the daughter of a merchant from Vedisagiri (Vidisha). According to the Sinhalese Buddhist tradition, their children, Mahendra and Sanghamitra, who preached Buddhism in modern Sri Lanka, were born in Ujjain.

From the Mauryan period, Northern Black Polished Ware, copper coins, terracotta ring wells, and ivory seals with Brahmi text have been excavated at Ujjain. Ujjain emerged as an important commercial centre, partially because it lay on the trade route connecting north India to the Deccan, starting from Mathura. It also emerged as an important center for intellectual learning among Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions.

In the Post-Mauryan period, the Sungas and the Satavahanas ruled the city consecutively. The Satavahanas and the Ror Sakas, known as Western Satraps, contested for control of the city for a period. Following the end of the Satavahana dynasty, the Rors retained Ujjain from the second to the twelfth century C.E.
After the Mauryans, Ujjain was controlled by a number of empires and dynasties, including local dynasties, the Shungas, the Western Satraps, the Satavahanas, and the Guptas.

Ujjain remained as an important city of the Guptas during the 4th and the 5th centuries. Kalidasa, the great Indian classical poet of the 5th century who lived in the times of the Gupta king Vikramaditya wrote his epic work &quot;Meghadūta&quot; in which he describes the richness of Ujjain and its people. In the 6th century CE the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited India. He describes the ruler of Avanti as a king who was generous to the poor and presented them with gifts.
Bhartṛhari is said to have written his great epics, Virat Katha, Neeti Sataka, the love story of Pradyot Princess Vasavadatta and Udayan in Ujjayini, as the city was called during his times. The writings of Bhasa are set in Ujjain, and he probably lived in the city. Kalidasa also refers to Ujjain multiple times, and it appears that he spent at least a part of his life in Ujjain. &quot;Mrichchhakatika&quot; by Shudraka is also set in Ujjain. Ujjain also appears in several stories as the capital of the legendary emperor Vikramaditya of the Parmar dynasty. Somadeva&#x27;s &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; (11th century) mentions that the city was created by Vishwakarma, and describes it as invincible, prosperous and full of wonderful sights. Ujjain was sacked several times by the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate in the 8th century CE. The Arabs called the city &quot;Uzayn&quot;.

=== Medieval period ===
The Paramaras (9th-14th century CE) built the City of Ujjain and shifted the region&#x27;s capital from Ujjain to Dhar. Mahmud of Ghazni sacked the city and forced it to pay tribute during his invasion in India. In 1235 CE, Iltutmish of the Delhi Sultanate plundered the city. With the decline of the Paramara kingdom, Ujjain ultimately came under Islamic rule, like other parts of north-central India. The city continued to be an important city of central India. As late as the time of the Mughal vassal Jai Singh II (1688-1743), who constructed a Jantar Mantar in the city, Ujjain was the largest city and capital of the Malwa Subah. The city continued to be developed during Muslim rule, especially under the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. It was used as an important military headquarters.

=== Modern period ===

During the 18th century, the city briefly became the capital of Scindia state of the Maratha Empire, when Ranoji Scindia established his capital at Ujjain in 1731. Mahadji Scindia constructed a grand palace with a hundred rooms around which the Maratha sardars constructed their own mansions. Ruined and destroyed temples were restored and newer ones were built. But his successors moved to Gwalior, where they ruled the Gwalior State in the latter half of the 18th century. The struggle of supremacy between the Holkars of Indore and Scindias (who ruled Ujjain) led to rivalry between the merchants of the two cities. On 18 July 1801, the Holkars defeated the Scindias at the Battle of Ujjain. On 1 September, Yashwantrao Holkar entered the city, and demanded a sum of 15 lakh rupees from the city. He received only 1/8th of this amount; the rest was pocketed by his officers. A force sent by Daulatrao Scindia later regained control of Ujjain. After both Holkar and Scindias accepted the British suzerainty, the British colonial administrators decided to develop Indore as an alternative to Ujjain, because the merchants of Ujjain had supported certain anti-British people. John Malcolm, the British administrator of Central India, decided to reduce the importance of Ujjain &quot;by transferring a great part of that consequence it now enjoys to the Towns of Indore and Rutlam cities, which are and will continue more under our control.&quot;

After Indian independence, Ujjain was placed in Madhya Bharat state, which in turn was fused into Madhya Pradesh in 1956.

==Industry==
Major industrial areas surrounding Ujjain are &#x27;Dewas Road Industrial Area&#x27;, &#x27;Maxi Road Industrial Area&#x27; Vikram Udhogpuri, and &#x27;Tajpur Industrial Area&#x27;.

Indore and Dewas are the cities where majority of the industries are present. Both Indore and Dewas are in close proximity to Ujjain, providing employment to people in Ujjain and nearby areas.

The Government of Madhya Pradesh has allotted 1,200 acres for the development of an industrial area on the Dewas-Ujjain Road (MP State Highway 18) near Narwar village. Originally named &quot;Vikramaditya Knowledge City&quot;, the area was envisaged as an educational hub. Due to diminished investment prospects, it was renamed to &quot;Vikram Udyog Nagari&quot; (&quot;Vikram Industrial City&quot;). As of 2014, the government has conceptualized it as a half-industrial, half-educational area. The stakeholders in the project include the state government and the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) Trust.

==Transportation==

===Airport===
Ujjain does not have any airport but has an airstrip on Dewas road which is used for air transport purposes. In 2013, the Government of Madhya Pradesh started a Ujjain-Bhopal air services as a joint venture with Ventura AirConnect. Due to very low booking, the ambitious project was scrapped. The main reason for the failure of the plan was due to improper timing of flights. The nearest airport is the Devi Ahilyabai Holkar International Airport at Indore (57 km).

<doc id="901122" wikidata="Q5312193" url="?curid=901122" title="Duel of the Fates">
<text>&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; is a musical theme recurring in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy and the Expanded Universe. It was composed by John Williams and recorded for the film soundtrack of &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and the London Voices. This symphonic piece is played with both a full orchestra and a choir. The lyrics are based on a fragment of an archaic Welsh poem &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; (&quot;Battle of the Trees&quot;), and are sung in Sanskrit. The piece debuts during the final lightsaber duel in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. With the music video for this theme, the LSO became the only classical group to ever have a video debut on MTV’s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; lasted 11 days on the countdown.

== Composition ==
&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; was composed by John Williams and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and the London Voices for the &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; film soundtrack. The symphonic piece is played with both a full orchestra and a choir. The lyrics are based on a fragment of an archaic Welsh poem &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; (&quot;Battle of the Trees&quot;), and sung in Sanskrit. The translation was loose and Williams arranged it by ear, while rearranging the syllables, so the pronunciation of the Sanskrit is not accurate and the meaning of the stanza is lost in the actual singing.

The piece is mainly polyphonic and is in the keys of E and G minor. It has a tempo of roughly 152 bpm, and a duple meter with a time signature of 4/4. The composition is four minutes and fourteen seconds long.

Although Williams conducted &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; to appear as a concert suite in the end credits (rather than the film), Williams did record similar cues using the ostinato motif, and in one instance, a &#x27;cut down&#x27; version, labelled the &quot;Great Duel&quot;. John Williams stated the chorus was introduced to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. Williams compared the setting of the battle to a pagan altar, and that the duel itself &quot;seems like a dance or a ballet, a religious ceremony of some kind, probably ending in the death of one of the combatants&quot;.

== Appearances in &quot;Star Wars&quot; ==

The music had its debut during the final lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. The beginning portion used on the soundtrack is replaced with the beginning of a separate track titled &quot;Qui-Gon&#x27;s Noble End&quot;; however, the full version of the original recording is used during the film&#x27;s end credits.

An abridged version is played in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; when Anakin Skywalker used a swoop bike to search for his mother.

The piece &quot;Battle of the Heroes&quot;, which was played in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, during the battle sequence between Yoda and Darth Sidious in the senate chamber on Coruscant, and the simultaneous battle between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar, had a piece of &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;, but rewritten in a tragic mode. Lucas had expressed in a documentary of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; that he wanted to use “Duel of the Fates” in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; as he liked the feeling of the work. However, he decided not to use it mainly because it did not match the tragic mood of the duel between Obi-Wan and Vader. “Duel of the Fates” makes an appearance during the Yoda/Sidious fight scene. For this instance, John Williams re-recorded the choir and layered it over the vocal-less recording from &quot;Episode I&quot;.

&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; can be heard in a number of &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, including &quot;Star Wars Episode I: Racer&quot;, &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; video game, &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Battlefront II&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, and &quot;Angry Birds Star Wars II&quot;. The theme also plays during &quot;Soulcalibur IV&quot;, whenever The Apprentice fights within either of the game&#x27;s three Star Wars-themed stages, as well as during his extended ending. &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; also plays when Darth Maul appears during the Jedi Training Academy show featured at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and Disneyland.

A special of &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot; called &quot;The Empire Strikes Out&quot; features a short section of &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;, in which Darth Maul hums along with the music while declaring how &quot;awesome&quot; he is.

Another &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot; special, entitled &quot;The Yoda Chronicles: Menace of the Sith&quot;, also featured &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;. Count Dooku plays the music on a radio during a demonstration of the Sith clone Jek-14&#x27;s power. Darth Maul complains that &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; is his theme song, to which Asajj Ventress replies &quot;Can somebody say diva?&quot;.

&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; can also be heard softly in the background when Maul appears in &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; is heard in a TV spot for &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; titled &quot;Duel&quot;, in which it is mixed with &quot;The Imperial March&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; was the title of a working script by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly for &quot;Episode IX&quot; before the film was re-envisioned as &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;.

A reorchestrated version of the song can be heard in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; episode &quot;The Phantom Apprentice&quot; while the characters Ahsoka Tano and Maul duel.

Elements of the song were used in the teaser trailer for &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;.

== Reception ==
Despite only being slightly used in the film &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, the theme &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; has gone on to define the music of the prequel trilogy. It was so loved by fans that it went on to be blended into the theme &quot;Battle of the Heroes&quot; in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

=== Use outside of &quot;Star Wars&quot; ===
&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; has also been used to reference and satirize &quot;Star Wars&quot;. For instance, in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Please Homer, Don&#x27;t Hammer &#x27;Em&quot;, the song plays in a sequence parodying &quot;Star Wars&quot;, during an allergen-stick (of shrimp and peanut) battle between Bart Simpson and Seymour Skinner.

The song was also used as the theme for the 2003 Broadcast of the Drum Corps International World Championships on PBS.

&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; was used in the original BBC broadcast of &quot;Top Gear&quot; Series 9 Episode 2 in 2007, during the segment in which host James May drives a Bugatti Veyron to its top speed at the Volkswagen test track at Ehra-Lessien. 

Tottenham Hotspur F.C. uses &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; to announce the appearance of the players from the tunnel.

J.P. Anderson&#x27;s band Rabbit Junk used a sample of &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; in the song &quot;Demons&quot;, which appears on the album &quot;Reframe&quot;.

The Boston Pops performed the piece as the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins entered Gillette Stadium for the 2016 NHL Winter Classic.

<doc id="901125" wikidata="Q5980498" url="?curid=901125" title="Iain Lee">
<text>Iain Lee (born Iain Lee Rougvie; 9 June 1973) is an English former broadcaster, writer, and television presenter and stand-up comedian who hosts the phone-in talk show &quot;The Late Night Alternative&quot; on &quot;pay to view&quot; Patreon.

Lee&#x27;s career began in the 1990s as a stand-up comedian before he gained nationwide fame as co-host of &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; from 1998 to 2000 and the breakfast show &quot;&quot; in 2003. He then embarked on a full-time radio career in 2005, hosting mainly talk-based shows on LBC 97.3, Absolute Radio, BBC Three Counties Radio, BBC Radio WM, and talkRADIO, which earned him numerous radio awards. In July 2020, after his contract at talkRADIO was not renewed, Lee launched his Twitch show.

==Early life==
Iain Lee Rougvie was born on 9 June 1973 in Slough, then a part of Buckinghamshire. He has Scottish roots. Lee&#x27;s father worked at the props department at the BBC and his mother was a secretary until she developed multiple sclerosis which put her into an early retirement. The couple divorced when Lee was a youngster.

Lee was raised on a council estate and recalled being bullied by fellow pupils because they considered him posh. By the late 1990s, Lee had dropped the &quot;Rougvie&quot; from his name. He officially changed his name to Iain Lee by deed poll in 2008, due to his troubled relationship with his father. Lee is the nephew of Scottish former footballer Doug Rougvie. He attended Herschel Grammar School in Slough and studied performing arts at Middlesex University.

==Career==

===Comedy===
Lee began a stand-up comedy career in the 1990s, initially performing on the London circuit exclusively before touring nationwide. Lee considers his time as a stand-up to be a low point in his life, due to the fact that he started abusing drugs and alcohol during this time. He met Mackenzie Crook, who was also a stand-up comic at the time and the two became friends.

===Radio===
Lee began his radio career in December 1997, presenting a four-hour show on Horizon 103.3, an independent station in Milton Keynes, on Christmas Day. At that point, he was 24 years old with only fifteen minutes experience in a studio and did not take any compliance or Ofcom regulation exam prior. Lee went on to feature on the station&#x27;s breakfast show &quot;The Morning Crew&quot; hosted by Trevor Marshall and Helen Legh, as Iain in Black Thunder and Iain McCartney. From 1999 to 2001, Lee hosted a show on Xfm London.

Lee embarked on a full-time radio career in January 2005, starting with a stint on talk station LBC 97.3. He joined the station hosting weekend evenings before moving to afternoon drive, which he named &quot;The 3 Hour 4 &#x27;Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show&quot; and later &quot;The 3-and-a-Half Hour 3 &#x27;Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show&quot;. Lee was known for hosting a segment named Triple M (also known as Mental Mayhem or Mick&#x27;s Mental Mayhem), where calls went straight to air without being pre-screened, which Nick Abbot, Tommy Boyd, and Clive Bull had also done. The segment received its own dedicated slot on Sunday nights in 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station. Lee then hosted the 7–10pm weekday slot which was named &quot;Iain Lee&#x27;s Good Evening&quot;. In 2007, Global Radio purchased LBC which led to a change in management, who introduced a talk format of topical and news-driven conversation. Lee&#x27;s presenting style fell out of favour and he left the station without prior announcement in November 2007.

In January 2008, Lee began to host &quot;The Sunday Night Show&quot; on Virgin Radio, later Absolute Radio, from 10pm to 1am that featured music and talk. In April 2009, Lee wrestled a listener which was broadcast the following month. From 12 October 2009, Lee took over the Monday to Thursday evening slot. In October 2011, the station announced that Lee&#x27;s contract would be terminated with immediate effect by mutual agreement. His departure occurred during a court case in which a listener was accused of harassing Lee, his wife, and the show&#x27;s producer.
From 2012 to 2015, Lee presented the weekday breakfast show on BBC Three Counties Radio, a local service that served Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, and Buckinghamshire. He later said that he accepted the job as he was unable to find work elsewhere, and felt &quot;crushed&quot; and a little humiliated about taking it at first. From December 2013, Lee also presented a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio WM, the BBC&#x27;s West Midlands service, which was followed by a Friday afternoon slot on the station from September 2014. He left the station in the following August, citing that management considered Lee hosting both slots as &quot;odd&quot; and wanted him to just present on Saturdays, which he rejected. In May 2014, Lee&#x27;s Three Counties show won a Radio Academy Award for Breakfast Show of the Year (Under 10 Million). On 12 August 2014, Lee was accused of making a racist remark to his producer following a spoof on-air argument, in which Lee said; &quot;Go on, go and do the black and Asian show. Bye bye.&quot; The argument was described as banter and the BBC apologised for the comments. In November 2015, Lee was fired from Three Counties. His departure followed complaints received about his interview with a lawyer from Christian Concern earlier in the month, in which Lee accused her of being &quot;bigoted&quot; and &quot;homophobic&quot; after she defended a minister quoting verses from the Bible condemning homosexuality as sinful.

In February 2016, Lee announced that he had joined the first line-up of presenters for the launch of a new talk radio station, talkRADIO. The station began to air on 21 March 2016, with Lee hosting &quot;The Late Night Alternative&quot; from 10pm to 1 am on weekdays. In 2017, he won a Gold Award at the Audio and Radio Industry Awards in the Best Speech Presenter – Non-Breakfast category. He won a second in 2020, this time for Moment of the Year for directing emergency services to a caller who had taken an overdose. Despite the success, Lee announced on 2 June 2020 that his contract was not renewed.

On 10 July 2020, Lee announced that he had been signed by Twitch to continue hosting &quot;The Late Night Alternative&quot; on its streaming platform. The first launched on 20 July and is recorded from Lee&#x27;s home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The show allows video calls from viewers worldwide.

In June 2022, Lee was announced as the new presenter of Jack FM&#x27;s breakfast show, &quot;Iain Lee’s Rude Awakening&quot;, from 4 July.
On 6 February 2023, Lee announced his retirement from radio in order to focus more on his work as a counsellor.

Iain presented his final radio show on 8 February 2023, on Jack FM, in a show which featured previous regular callers and Producers from across his career.

===Television===
From 1998 to 2000, Lee was a correspondent and co-host of the satirical comedy show &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; on Channel 4. The show became a start-up for comedians Sacha Baron Cohen and Ricky Gervais. In one incident, Lee received death threats and had a stalker after he joked about Danniella Westbrook and her drug use. The police advised him to move out of his flat; he lived with Mackenzie Crook and in a hotel before the matter was resolved. In January 2000, Lee and co-host Daisy Donovan were criticised by Ofcom for making &quot;death jokes&quot; on the recently murdered Jill Dando. After four series, Lee walked out five days before filming of the fifth was due to start. He later said that it was an unfair move, but felt the quality of the show&#x27;s humour had declined and Channel 4 had cut its budget. Lee said he would have earned £90,000 if he had stayed.

In 2002, Lee accepted to co-host a relaunch of the Channel 4 live breakfast show &quot;&quot; with reality television star Kate Lawler, from January 2003. The show failed to make an impact in viewing figures, however, and it ended in December 2003. By this time, Lee described himself as a &quot;full blown cocaine addict&quot; and would often smoke cannabis before filming &quot;RI:SE&quot; and take cocaine afterwards. Lee described the year 2004 as &quot;absolutely terrible&quot; in regard to his career and started to binge drink to cope with the stress, and spending around £2,000 on cocaine each week. Lee went on to present the video game show &quot;Thumb Bandits&quot; on Channel 4. Later he made regular appearances on Sky News and &quot;This Morning&quot;, and hosted the &quot;Big Brother&quot; companion series &quot;Bit on the Psych&quot; for Channel 5.

In November 2017, Lee took part in the seventeenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. Lee entered the show on Day 5. During the show, Lee was elected Prime Minister of 10 Downing Creek. Lee made it to the final and finished in third place. He spoke openly about mental health whilst participating in the show.

From the start of 2018, Lee was on the breakfast TV show &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, filling in for Richard Arnold who was taking a 3-week break.

===Other work===
Lee currently writes a column in the Retro Gamer magazine. He formerly wrote a gaming column for MSN.co.uk, as well as recording monthly podcasts. He has also appeared on XLeague.tv discussing video games.

Lee has appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, and presented the official &quot;Big Brother&quot; radio show with co-host Gemma Cairney, entitled &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Ears&quot;. Lee has also been heard as a continuity announcer on the TV channel Dave.

In August 2007, Lee launched a podcast entitled &quot;Iain Lee Presents... Shindiggery&quot;. It ended in November 2008.

In 2009, Lee took part in an experimental comedy performance by artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard in Sheffield called Performer. Audience. Fuck Off, a spin-off to the Performer/Audience/Mirror originally conceived in 1975 by American artist Dan Graham, whereby the performer does their act behind a mirror reflecting the audience.

In February 2012, Lee launched &quot;The Iain Lee Pocket Radio Show&quot;, a podcast similar in style to his radio shows but utilised various social media platforms for content. Most of it featured conversations with listeners via phone calls or Skype chats. Listeners were also invited to interact with the show by sending AudioBoos to be included in the recording. The podcast also included Lee interviewing guests and celebrity news with Elisa Roche.

Lee had a cameo role in a music video for the British IBM&#x27;s self-titled single, released in 2012.

In 2015, Lee and Glenn Gretlund had formed 7a Records, an independent record label specialising in obscure recordings by The Monkees and the group&#x27;s members. In 2020, Lee sold his share of the company.

===The Late Night Alternative===

The Late Night Alternative (TLNA) is an online phone-in show Lee and Katherine Boyle hosted on streaming platform Twitch. The programme was first broadcast on British radio station Talkradio between March 2016 and June 2020, and won several Audio and Radio Industry Awards, including &#x27;Best Speech Presenter – Non-Breakfast&#x27; for Lee. In July 2020, Lee and Boyle announced the programme&#x27;s return via Twitch, with the first episode airing on 20 July.

In May 2017, Lee and Boyle created a record for a phone-in British radio show when the pair took over 150 calls in one three hour show, after announcing anyone could call and would be put through straight to air. The attempt to take a world record 200 calls failed when the phone system broke down due to the number of callers attempting to get through.

On 19 December 2018, a man called the show after a drug overdose. Lee kept the man on the line whilst Boyle directed the emergency services to his location, with many on social media praising Lee&#x27;s decisive actions. Lee revealed on 24 December 2018 that the man had survived and was now back home after receiving specialist treatment for two days. Lee and Boyle were later awarded a Gold in the &#x27;Moment of the Year&#x27; category at the 2020 Audio and Radio Industry Awards for this call.

On 2 June 2020, Lee announced his contract at Talkradio would not be renewed, having presented his final programme the previous evening. On 10 July, the pair issued a press release confirming they had been signed by internet streaming service Twitch and would re-launch the programme on 20 July.

==Personal life==
In March 2018, Lee announced that he and his wife, broadcaster Helena Wilkinson, were getting divorced. The couple have two sons. At the time of the announcement, Lee confessed he had relapsed in drug use after being sober for 13 years, in a three-month period following his stint on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, to which he credited Katherine Boyle in taking him to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. In September 2020, Lee said he had broken a two-and-a-half year period of sobriety when he relapsed on cocaine.

In July 2019, Lee came out as bisexual on his radio show, something that he had felt embarrassed about and tried to handle it with drugs and extramarital affairs. He credited sessions with a therapist to deal with his depression, which began when he started having sex with older men at fourteen. He realised that &quot;Now I can see that it was abuse.&quot;

In September 2020, Lee started a college course to become a counsellor.

<text>Kaohsiung Metro () is a rapid transit and light rail system covering the metropolitan area of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Its rapid transit network is known as Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit System or Kaohsiung Rapid Transit (KRT). Construction of the MRT started in October 2001. The MRT opened in 2008 and the Circular light rail in 2015. Kaohsiung Metro is operated by the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation (KRTC; ) under a BOT contract the company signed with the Kaohsiung City Government.

The system uses romanizations derived from Tongyong Pinyin.

==History==
The Kaohsiung City Government undertook a feasibility study for constructing a rapid transit system in Kaohsiung in 1987. After finding favorable results, the city government began lobbying the Central Government for approval and funding. In 1990, approval was obtained to establish the &quot;Kaohsiung City Mass Rapid Transit Bureau&quot; and planning of the rapid transit network started. The first phase of the &quot;Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit System&quot;, the Red and Orange Lines, was approved in 1991, but disputes in funding shares between Kaohsiung City and County Governments stalled the project. The &quot;Kaohsiung City Mass Rapid Transit Bureau&quot; was officially established in 1994, to coincide with the project&#x27;s move into the final scoping and detail design stages.

Work continued until 1996, when the Central Government ordered KMRT to look into constructing the project via the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) method. In 1999, the city government put out a request for the BOT contract to construct the first phase of the KMRT system. In 2000, out of the three consortia that submitted bids, &quot;Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation&quot; (&quot;KRTC&quot;) was awarded the contract, receiving priority negotiating rights with the city government in constructing the system. KRTC obtained a company license and was registered in December 2000. In January 2001, KRTC signed the &quot;Construction and Operation Agreement&quot; and the &quot;Development Agreement&quot; with the Kaohsiung City Government, signaling the beginning of construction of the KMRT system. The main participants of the KRTC are: China Steel Corporation, Southeast Cement Corporation, RSEA Engineering Corporation, China Development Industrial Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Taiwan. The current system cost NT$181.3 (US$5.46 billion) to construct and includes a contract for 30 years of operation and maintenance. Construction costs were shared between the central government (79%), Kaohsiung City Government (19%), and Kaohsiung County Government (2%).

Construction began in October 2001, with 66 shield tunnels () completed in May 2006. The cut-and-cover and bored tunnel methods were used for construction of the lines. In November 2006, the first trial runs began on the Red Line. In January 2007, the last concrete slabs were laid for the 37 planned stations.

===Scandals and major construction accidents===
# In August 2004, a section of subway tunnel near Sizihwan metro station at the west end of the Orange line collapsed during construction due to loose sand underground and water break-ins. Four low-rise buildings near the collapsed tunnel had to be evacuated and later on had to be torn down due to major structure damages.

2. The Kaohsiung MRT Foreign Workers Scandal, involving alleged inhumane treatment of Thai migrant workers, erupted in 2005. Investigation revealed kickbacks to politicians by the contractor. The scandal had tainted the public confidence in the construction of the system and prompted a diplomatic response by the Thai Prime Minister asking the migrant workers to return to Thailand. Chen Chu, the Chairperson of the Council of Labor Affairs of the Executive Yuan, resigned as a result of the scandal.

3. In December 2005, another subway tunnel section of the Orange line at eastern Kaohsiung collapsed during construction. The collapse of the subway tunnel also brought about the collapse of a road tunnel above the subway tunnel. Several nearby buildings were evacuated for several days for inspection. It was estimated that the road tunnel could not be rebuilt and reopened for traffic for at least a few months. In January 2008, the section was still closed and traffic is diverted around the affected area.

===Opening===
Construction accidents delayed the opening of the MRT considerably from the originally planned December 2006 date. The Sanduo-Siaogang section of the Red Line was eventually opened to the public for free test rides during 8–11 February 2008, and the Red Line (except for 2 stations) opened for service on 9 March 2008. The Orange Line fully opened for service on 14 September 2008.

===Ridership===
Ridership has been far below expectations, with an average of 100,000 passengers per day versus an expected 360,000, and accumulated losses are expected to reach NT$6 billion by the end of 2009.

, the average daily ridership stands at about 178,975, with ridership figures significantly greater on weekends than on weekdays. During New Year&#x27;s Eve on 31 December 2012, the system transported 472,378 passengers. KRTC stated that ridership would need to exceed 380,000 passengers per day in order to break even.

===Unopened Stations===
The R1, R2, and O3 stations were planned originally but never built. The R1 and R2 stations were cancelled before construction, and O3 was cancelled due to a fire at the original station location.

==Routes==

Kaohsiung Metro is made up of the Red Line and Orange Line with 38 stations covering a distance of
. 27 of these stations are underground, with 9 elevated and 2 at-grade level. All underground stations have full height platform screen doors.

The light rail transit (LRT) system consists of the Circular Line with 38 stations.

** In operation: Main lines: 3, Extensions: 0
** Planned: Main lines: 9, Extensions: 6
** Total routes: Main lines: 11, Extension: 6
** Terminated: Main line: 1, Extensions: 1
===Red line===
From the intersection of Yanhai and Hanmin Roads in the Siaogang District in the South, the Red Line travels northwards, following Jhongshan Road as it passes by Kaohsiung International Airport, Labour Park, Sanduo Shopping District, Central Park, and the Dagangpu circle to . After crossing the track yard of TRA, the route then follows Bo&#x27;ai Road arriving at . Then the route passes through Banpingshan, extends along Zuonan Road to Nanzih Export Processing Zone, and continues into parts of the city formerly part of Kaohsiung County. The route finally passes along the Gaonan Highway to Ciaotou District and the southern border area of Gangshan District. The total length of Red Line is approximately , with 24 stations on the route, of which 15 are underground, 8 elevated and 1 at ground level. Two depots serve the line near and . The Red line (excluding Kaohsiung Medical University Gangshan Hospital metro station) commenced passenger service on 9 March 2008. Gangshan South station was opened for passenger service on 23 December 2012, followed by Gangshan on 30 June 2024.

===Orange line===
From the west, the Orange line starts at Sizihwan (Linhai 2nd Road), crosses the track yard of TRA Kaohsiung Port Station and follows Dayong Road, passing through Love River. The route then follows Jhongjheng Road as it passes by Kaohsiung City Council, Dagangpu Circle, Cultural Center, Martial Arts Stadium, and the Weiwuying Park planning site before entering parts of the city formerly part of Kaohsiung County. The route continues along Zihyou Road, Guangyuan Road and Jhongshan East Road in Fengshan District to Daliao District. The total length of the line is approximately , with 14 stations on the route. All stations are underground except Daliao Station, which is at ground level. A single depot has been built beside Daliao station to serve the line. The Orange Line commenced passenger service on 14 September 2008.

===Circular light rail===
The Circular LRT Line (aka Kaohsiung LRT, Kaohsiung Tram) for Kaohsiung is a light rail line. Construction of Phase I, C1 Kaisyuan to C14 Sizhihwan began in June 2013. Phase I had operations in September 2017. Phase II is inaugurated on 1 January 2024, turning the light rail line into a loop line.

A temporary light rail system for demonstration purposes, with just 2 stations, was built in the Central Park in 2004, using Melbourne D2 Tram cars from Siemens. As it was simply for demonstration purposes, it was closed soon after, and is no longer operational.

==Expansion projects==
Kaohsiung Metro is expected to be extended further into parts of Greater Kaohsiung, as well as Pingtung County.

=== Active projects ===
The Kaohsiung Underground Tunnel Project, extending from Baozhen Road, south of Zuoying Station, to Zhengyi Road, covers a distance of approximately . Alongside a twin-track tunnel, it will construct five commuter stations—Fine Arts Museum, Gushan, Sankuaicuo, Minzu and National Science and Technology Museum —as well as move underground Kaohsiung Station (R11 Station of Kaohsiung Metro included). The Zuoying Project runs from the new Zuoying Station to Baozhen Road, a length of , with the Neiwei and Zuoying stations to be moved underground. The Fengshan Project is the Kaohsiung project extension to Fengshan. It starts from the east of Dashun Overpass to Dazhi Overpass at Fengshan zone, covering a total length of about . The project includes adding one new underground commuter station Zhengyi/Chengqing station and the Fengshan Station underground. The Duration for the project is from 2006 to 2018. In 2016, subsequent works are under way on stations, tunnels and rail tracks.

=== All projects ===
==Rolling stock==

The rolling stock is based on the Siemens Modular Metro design manufactured by Siemens Mobility. Trains run in 3 car sets (though platforms are designed to be able to accommodate up to 6 car sets) and are powered by third rail. Seats are arranged parallel to the windows, unlike their Taipei Metro counterparts. LED displays are installed above every alternate door (other doors show the route map), showing the name of the current station and next station in Chinese and English. Automated announcements are made in Mandarin, Taiwanese (with the exception of since no Taiwanese translation for the name is available), Hakka, and English, with Japanese announcements at the major stations. The train has AC traction motors with IGBT–VVVF inverters powered by Siemens.

==Fares and ticketing==

The fares of KMRT is distance-based, with a minimum of NT$20 for trips within . The maximum fare on the Red Line is NT$60, from Siaogang Station to Ciaotou Station.

One-way fare is ticketed with an RFID IC token. In addition to the RFID IC token, there are four kinds of contactless smart card accepted. The iPASS card was the only card that could be used before 1 July 2016. After 1 July 2016, EasyCard, iCash2.0, HappyCash were accepted by the system.

==Ridership==
==Art==
Kaohsiung Arena Station, Formosa Boulevard Station, and Kaohsiung International Airport Station feature artworks integrated into the design of the station by international artists.

==Facilities and services==
Platform screen doors were supplied by ST Electronics have been installed at all underground stations. LCD television units have also been installed on platform doors for the broadcast of train information and advertisements. All stations are wheelchair accessible.

== K.R.T. Girls ==
The K.R.T. Girls are four anime-styled characters that serve as mascots for the Kaohsiung Metro.

<text>Daniel Lester Gauthier (; born December 2, 1963)
 is an American actor best known for his roles as Kevin Buchanan on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, Matt Liston on the sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot;, Brad Powell in the 1989 film &quot;Teen Witch&quot; and Lt. John McKay of the military drama series &quot;Tour of Duty&quot;.

==Early life==
Gauthier was born in Prineville, Oregon. He was inspired to act early on by his mother, who was a local theater actress in their Central Oregon home. By the time he turned 18, Gauthier moved to California to attend San Diego State University. He was recruited by SDSU&#x27;s track team and was a decathlete. After college, Gauthier found work by modeling with the Ford and Nina Blanchard modeling agencies.

== Career ==
In 1987, he landed his first credited television role in 1987 in FOX&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. Two years later, he starred in his first feature film, &quot;Teen Witch&quot; where he played the title character&#x27;s love interest. That same year, he landed his most high-profile primetime role as maverick helicopter pilot, Johnny McKay in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Tour of Duty&quot;. Following the end of the series, Gauthier continued to make guest appearances such television shows as &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Life Goes On&quot; and &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;. In 1993, he was cast in the comedy film &quot;Son in Law&quot;. He played Travis, the main character&#x27;s steady boyfriend who reacts unhappily to her changes from college life. By 1995, he landed a regular role on a series titled &quot;Courthouse&quot;. The show portrayed the trials and tribulations of court life. After nine episodes, the series was canceled. From 1996 to 1997, Gauthier found recurring roles on both &quot;Ellen&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. He guest-starred as Chip on an episode of &quot;Friends.&quot; In 1998, he was cast in the prime time soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;.

=== Daytime television ===
In June 2003, Gauthier became the eleventh actor to play former Lieutenant Governor Kevin Lord Riley Buchanan on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, a role he portrayed until November 16, 2006. The character of Kevin had been a &quot;good guy&quot; for most of Gauthier&#x27;s run, but in the last year had been written with more of a dark edge. The show chose not to renew Gauthier&#x27;s contract and the character was written off; Gauthier was subsequently nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance. In August 2007, Gauthier made a brief return to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; for the series&#x27; 9,999th and 10,000th episodes.

<text>USS &quot;El Paso&quot; (PF-41) was a crewed by the United States Coast Guard for the United States Navy. She was named after El Paso, a city situated in Western Texas and along the border with New Mexico and the Mexican state of Chihuahua.

&quot;El Paso&quot; was launched on 16 July 1943 at Consolidated Steel Corporation, Ltd., in Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract, sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Kaster; and commissioned on 1 December 1943.

==Service history==
Sailing from San Diego, California, on 20 February 1944, &quot;El Paso&quot; arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 4 April after training at Pearl Harbor and convoy escort duty to the Gilberts and Espiritu Santo en route. The frigate patrolled in the New Guinea area, and carried out several bombardment missions. On 25 May she shelled enemy positions at Maffin Bay, and 2 days later in company with two destroyer escorts, bombarded Wakde Island. On the night of 14 June she provided fire support at Aitape, and on the 25th blasted the edge of the airfield on Wakde Island. The next mission was a combination scouting, salvage, and rescue work at Pagan and Fanildo Islands on 25 August.

In September 1944, &quot;El Paso&quot; joined the screen of the forces landing at Morotai, then operated between this newly won base and New Guinea during the buildup for the invasion of the Philippines. On 29 October, nine days after the initial landings, &quot;El Paso&quot; arrived at Leyte for patrol and screen duty. She returned to New Guinea in November to bombard Sarmi Point and Mount Makko on the 11th, then was assigned to escort duty between New Guinea and the Philippines until the year&#x27;s end.

&quot;El Paso&quot; departed Humboldt Bay (Hollandia) on 6 January 1945, and sailed to New York for overhaul during which she was converted to a weather ship. Her conversion was interrupted by a convoy escort voyage to Oran, Algeria, in April and May 1945.

When World War II ended, the frigate was on the way back to the Pacific, and arriving at Leyte on 23 September, served as a weather station ship in the Philippines until 16 April 1946. She returned to the west coast, was decommissioned at Seattle, Washington, on 18 July 1946, and sold on 14 October 1947.

&quot;El Paso&quot; received Five battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Deion Luwynn Sanders Sr. (born August 9, 1967) is an American football coach and former player who is the head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes. Nicknamed &quot;Prime Time&quot; and &quot;Coach Prime&quot;, he played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, and Baltimore Ravens. Sanders was also an outfielder for nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, and San Francisco Giants. He won two Super Bowl titles and made one World Series appearance in 1992, making him the only athlete to play in a Super Bowl and World Series.

Sanders played college football as a cornerback for the Florida State Seminoles, winning the Jim Thorpe Award in 1988 before being selected by the Falcons fifth overall in the 1989 NFL draft. He also played as a return specialist and occasionally as a wide receiver during his NFL career, receiving six first-team All-Pros and eight Pro Bowl honors. He won Super Bowl XXIX with the 49ers and Super Bowl XXX with the Cowboys. Sanders was inducted into the College Football and Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011.

Sanders briefly worked as an analyst for NFL Network before coaching high school players throughout the 2010s. In 2020, Sanders was named head coach of the Jackson State Tigers, leading them to two consecutive Celebration Bowl appearances and the school&#x27;s first undefeated regular season in 2022. Sanders was named Buffaloes head coach in 2023. His sons Shilo and Shedeur played for him with Jackson State and Colorado.

==Early life==
Sanders was born on August 9, 1967, in Fort Myers, Florida, to Connie Sanders and Mims Sanders. His parents divorced when Sanders was two years old. Sanders was raised by his mother and her new husband, Willie Knight, whom Sanders credits with being influential in his life. He attended North Fort Myers High School, and was a letterman and All-State honoree in football, basketball and baseball. In 1985, Sanders was named to the Florida High School Association All-Century Team which selected the top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state.

The Kansas City Royals selected Sanders out of North Fort Myers High School in the sixth round of the 1985 Major League Baseball draft. However, he did not sign with the Royals. Sanders decided to play with Florida State University instead of signing with the Kananas City Royals.

== College career ==
Sanders enrolled at Florida State University and played three sports for the Florida State Seminoles: football, baseball, and track. Beginning in his freshman year, he started in the Seminoles&#x27; secondary, played outfield for the baseball team that finished fifth in the nation, and helped lead the track and field team to a conference championship.

Under head coach Bobby Bowden, Sanders was a third-team All-American in 1986, and a two-time consensus All-American cornerback in 1987 and 1988, intercepting 14 passes in his career, including three in bowl games, and managed to return one interception 100 yards for a touchdown, breaking Fred Biletnikoff&#x27;s interception return record by one yard. He won the Jim Thorpe Award in 1988. He was also a standout punt returner for Florida State, leading the nation in 1988 with his punt return average, and breaking the school&#x27;s record for career punt return yards. Sanders made an interception with five seconds left to seal Florida State&#x27;s 13–7 win over Auburn in the 1989 Sugar Bowl during the 1988 postseason. Based on those accolades, his No. 2 jersey at Florida State was retired in 1995. He finished his career with 126 punt returns for 1,429 yards and three touchdowns, as well as 14 interceptions, returning them for 287 yards and three scores. At the end of his FSU career, Sanders&#x27; 14 interceptions was the second highest total in school history. Bowden would later state that Sanders was his &quot;measuring stick for athletic ability&quot;.

While playing baseball under head coach Mike Martin at Florida State, Sanders&#x27; batting average was .331 in 1986. He also compiled 27 stolen bases in 1987.

On May 16, 1987 (while the Metro Conference baseball and track championships were being played simultaneously in Columbia, South Carolina), Sanders played in the conference semifinal baseball game against Southern Mississippi, ran a leg of a 4 × 100 relay, then returned to play in the baseball championship game against Cincinnati. Though Sanders&#x27; relay team did not place in the event, the FSU track team was the overall conference champion, and the baseball team won the conference title as well.

===Statistics===
== Professional baseball career ==
===Drafts and minor leagues===
Sanders had a nine-year, part-time baseball career, playing left and center field in 641 games with four teams. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the sixth round of the 1985 draft, but did not sign with them. The New York Yankees selected Sanders in the 30th round of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed with the team on June 22. He batted .284 in 28 minor league games after signing.

The Yankees invited Sanders to spring training in 1989. Assigned to wear No. 71 as a uniform number, Sanders requested a single digit number. The Yankees gave him No. 30, the lowest number available, which offended many veteran players on the team. Sanders opened the 1989 season with the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Double–A Eastern League. Though Sanders planned to leave the Yankees in July to attend NFL training camp, he became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Falcons, and used the Yankees as leverage.

===New York Yankees (1989–1990)===
Sanders received a promotion to the major leagues, and spent the summer with the Columbus Clippers of the Triple–A International League. Sanders made his MLB debut on May 31, 1989.

During the 1989 season, Sanders hit a home run and scored a touchdown in the NFL in the same week, becoming the only player ever to do so. Sanders is also the only person to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series. Sanders and Bo Jackson were the preeminent multi-sport athletes of their time, but prior to the 1990 season, they had never squared off against each other in a professional game. That changed in 1990, when Jackson and Sanders met five times on the diamond—the most memorable of which came on July 17, in what was billed as &quot;The Bo and Prime Time Show&quot;. After Bo Jackson&#x27;s three-homer night, Sanders said, &quot;He&#x27;s (Bo&#x27;s) one of the best athletes who ever put on a uniform.&quot; Sanders himself hit a dramatic inside-the-park home run in the same game that was unsuccessfully fielded by Jackson.

Sanders made the Yankees&#x27; Opening Day roster for the 1990 season. On May 22, 1990, Sanders became involved in a dispute with Chicago White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk. Sanders started by stepping up to the plate with one out and a runner on third, drawing a dollar sign in the dirt before the pitch and then failed to run to first base after hitting a routine pop fly to shortstop, trotting back to the dugout instead. The Yankee fans booed, and Fisk told Sanders to run the ball out and called Sanders a &quot;piece of shit&quot;. Later in the game, Sanders told Fisk that &quot;the days of slavery are over&quot;. Fisk was furious, later saying: &quot;He comes up and wants to make it a racial issue, there&#x27;s no racial issue involved. There is a right way and a wrong way to play this game.&quot;

By mid-July, Sanders expressed that he was unsure if he would remain with the Yankees or report to training camp for the upcoming NFL season. He requested a $1 million salary for the 1991 season, and the Yankees ended negotiations on a contract extension with Sanders. He left the team, finishing the 1990 season with a .158 batting average and three home runs in 57 games. In September 1990, the Yankees placed Sanders on waivers with the intention of giving him his release, as Yankees&#x27; general manager Gene Michael said that Sanders&#x27; football career was stunting his baseball development.

===Atlanta Braves (1991–1994)===
Sanders later signed with the Atlanta Braves for the 1991 MLB season. On July 31, Sanders hit a key three-run homer to spark a comeback win against the Pittsburgh Pirates during the Braves&#x27; run to the National League West Division title. However, he left the Braves the very next day to report to the Atlanta Falcons because of a clause in his NFL contract and missed the postseason. Before the 1992 season, Sanders reworked his NFL deal, whereby he still reported to the Falcons for training camp in August, but was allowed to rejoin the Braves for the postseason.

During the 1992 season, his best year in the majors, Sanders hit .304 for the team, stole 26 bases, and led the NL with 14 triples in 97 games. In four games of the 1992 World Series, Sanders batted .533 with four runs, eight hits, two doubles, and one RBI while playing with a broken bone in his foot. His batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, total bases and win probability added each led the team in the series. Despite Sanders&#x27; performance, the Braves ultimately lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in six games. In Game 3, he narrowly avoided being a victim of what would have been only the second triple play in World Series history (following Bill Wambsganss&#x27; unassisted triple play in 1920). With Sanders on second base and Terry Pendleton on first, David Justice hit a deep fly ball to center field that Blue Jays center fielder Devon White unexpectedly caught with a leaping effort. Pendleton passed Sanders on the bases for the second out, but umpire Bob Davidson called Sanders safe after he scampered back to second base. Replays showed that Toronto third baseman Kelly Gruber tagged him on the heel before he returned to second.

=== Cincinnati Reds (1994–1995) ===
The Braves traded Sanders to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Roberto Kelly on May 30, 1994. In 46 games played, Sanders batted .277 and stole 19 bases. The following year, he played in 33 games for the Reds, recording a .240 batting average with 16 stolen bases before being traded to the San Francisco Giants.

=== San Francisco Giants (1995) ===
On July 21, 1995, the Reds traded Sanders, Dave McCarty, Ricky Pickett, John Roper, and Scott Service to the San Francisco Giants for Dave Burba, Darren Lewis, and Mark Portugal. He batted .280, hit 5 home runs and stole 8 bases in 52 games for the Giants.

===Cincinnati Reds (1997, 2001)===
In 1997, Sanders finished second in the NL with 56 stolen bases in 115 games while with the Cincinnati Reds before leaving baseball for three years.

Sanders returned to the Reds in 2001, but was released after playing in only 32 games and batting just .173. After Sanders&#x27; release from the Reds, he signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, who assigned him to the Triple-A Syracuse SkyChiefs.

Sanders&#x27; football contract had been negotiated to allow for him to play both baseball and football, but the terms of the contract stated that Sanders could miss NFL training camp and the first few games of the season only if he were playing Major League Baseball. Since he was not then on an MLB roster, Sanders had to leave Syracuse and return to the Washington Redskins so he would not violate his NFL contract. In his final professional baseball game, Sanders hit a solo home run and an RBI single in Syracuse&#x27;s 12–6 win over the Toledo Mud Hens. As those in MLB and the NFL urged Sanders to concentrate on only one sport (similar to what they did with Bo Jackson), he often explained, &quot;football is my wife and baseball is my mistress.&quot;

== Professional football career ==
=== Atlanta Falcons (1989–1993) ===
At the 1989 NFL Scouting Combine, Sanders ran 40-yard dash times of 4.27s and 4.29s. second 40-yard dash. He was the fifth pick overall in the 1989 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons, where he played until 1993. Despite fumbling (and recovering) his first NFL punt return (which was re-kicked on a penalty), Sanders ran for a touchdown on his second attempt of his first game. During his time in Atlanta, he intercepted 24 passes (including a career-high seven in 1993), three of which he returned for touchdowns. In 1992, he also led the league in kickoff return yards (1,067), yards per return (26.7) and return touchdowns (two). On October 11, 1992, Sanders played in a Falcons game in Miami and then flew to Pittsburgh, hoping to play in the Braves&#x27; League Championship Series game against the Pirates that evening and become the first athlete to play in two professional leagues in the same day. Sanders, however did not appear in the baseball game that night. During his five years playing with the Falcons, Sanders scored 10 touchdowns (three defensive, three kick returns, two punt returns, and two receptions).

=== San Francisco 49ers (1994) ===
After five seasons with Atlanta, Sanders signed on to play the 1994 season with the San Francisco 49ers. He had arguably his best season as a professional football player, recording six interceptions and returning them for an NFL-best 303 yards and three touchdowns, averaging 50.5 yards per return. (Average yards-per-interception return is not an official NFL statistic however.) It was also the most interception-return-yardage in a single-season since Charlie McNeil in 1961. Two of his interceptions were returned for a gain of at least 90 yards, making him the first player to do this in NFL history. On October 16, 1994, Sanders made his dramatic return to the Georgia Dome in a 49er uniform. After getting into a scuffle with his former Falcon teammate Andre Rison, Sanders intercepted a pass from quarterback Jeff George and returned it 93 yards while mockingly staring down the entire Falcons sideline before high-stepping into the end zone. Sanders was later voted the 1994 NFL Defensive Player of the Year. In Super Bowl XXIX, he recorded an end zone interception in the fourth quarter as the 49ers won over the San Diego Chargers, earning him his first championship ring.

=== Dallas Cowboys (1995–1999) ===
Sanders, along with his agent Eugene Parker, courted several teams in need of a cornerback. The teams in the &quot;Deion Sweepstakes&quot;, as it was called by the media, were the Philadelphia Eagles, Oakland Raiders, Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys, who had lost their starting cornerback Kevin Smith to injury for the rest of the season.

On September 9, 1995, (in Week 2 of the season), Sanders signed a lucrative contract with the Dallas Cowboys (seven years, $35 million with a $12.99 million signing bonus, because owner Jerry Jones was superstitious about the number 13), essentially making him at the time, the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL. Sanders later stated in his book &quot;Power, Money &amp; Sex: How Success Almost Ruined My Life&quot; that the Oakland Raiders offered him more money than any other team, but he chose to play in Dallas for more time on the offensive side of the ball, a chance to win back-to-back Super Bowls, and because of his friendship with Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin. Arthroscopic surgery kept him sidelined until his debut in Week 9, which was once again in Atlanta against the Falcons; the Cowboys won, 28–13. He went on to help the Cowboys win their third title in four years in Super Bowl XXX against the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he returned a punt for 11 yards and caught a 47-yard reception on offense, setting up Dallas&#x27;s first touchdown of the game and a 27–17 victory. Sanders played four more seasons with Dallas, earning Pro Bowl selection in all of them. On June 2, 2000, he was released in a salary-cap move.

===Washington Redskins (2000)===
Soon after the Cowboys released Sanders, the Washington Redskins signed Sanders to a seven-year, $56 million contract. At the end of the 2000 season and an above-average statistical year, Sanders abruptly retired in July 2001 after only playing one year with the Redskins.

On December 23, 2002, the Redskins waived Sanders from the reserve/retired list in order to potentially allow him to play for the Oakland Raiders in the 2002–03 NFL playoffs. If he had passed through waivers unclaimed, he would have been able to sign a free-agent contract with any team and play during the season. However, on December 25, five teams (the Indianapolis Colts, Kansas City Chiefs, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Diego Chargers and Tennessee Titans) placed waiver bids for him, with the Chargers claiming him by having the highest waiver priority. Since it was too late in the season to be activated from the reserve/retired list, he was unable to play for the Chargers for the rest of the season.

=== Baltimore Ravens (2004–2005) ===
In 2004, Sanders announced his intention to come out of retirement after being convinced by his friend Joe Zorovich, Baltimore Ravens cornerback Corey Fuller, and linebacker Ray Lewis to play. He signed a one-year deal with the Ravens to be a nickelback. Sanders chose to wear the number 37, which matched his age at the time, to preemptively let people know that he was well aware of his relative senior status as an NFL player (additionally, his usual number 21 was already being worn by Ravens Pro Bowl cornerback Chris McAlister). Against the Buffalo Bills in Week 7 of 2004, Sanders scored his ninth career interception return touchdown, moving him into a tie with Ken Houston and Aeneas Williams, and behind Rod Woodson (with 12), for second place all-time in the statistical category.

Sanders played in every game of the 2005 season. The Ravens failed to qualify for the postseason for the second straight year and he retired in January 2006.

==Coaching career==
===High school===
While continuing to work as an NFL analyst, Sanders became the head coach for the Prime Prep Academy, which he co-founded. The executive director of the school twice tried to fire Sanders, in one instance after witnesses said Sanders grabbed a school official by the collar, causing the official to fall to the floor. He stayed as the head coach for 2012 and 2013. The school was shut down in 2015 amid a spate of problems.

In 2015, he was hired as the head coach for Triple A Academy, where he was the coach for two seasons.

In 2017, he became the offensive coordinator for Trinity Christian High School giving him the opportunity to coach his sons Shilo and Shedeur Sanders, along with his eldest son Deion Jr.

===Jackson State===
====2020 season====
On September 21, 2020, Deion Sanders became the 21st head coach of the Jackson State Tigers of the historically black (HBCU) Jackson State University. The Tigers play in the second level of NCAA football, the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). In his first season in spring 2021, abbreviated and delayed from its normally intended fall 2020 schedule due to COVID-19 disruptions, he led the Tigers to a 4–3 record, with one win by forfeit.

====2021 season====
In the fall 2021 season, Sanders led the Tigers to the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) title and a program record of 11 wins, also being named the recipient of the fall 2021 Eddie Robinson Award as the season&#x27;s top FCS head coach. Jackson State went on to play in the 2021 Celebration Bowl where they were defeated by South Carolina State 31–10. The following season, Jackson State again played in the Celebration Bowl where they were again defeated 41–34 by North Carolina Central, bringing Coach Sanders&#x27; overall bowl record to 0–2.

====2022 season====
Sanders notably flipped the recruitment of defensive back Travis Hunter who was the number one overall recruit in the 2022 class. Hunter initially committed to Sanders&#x27; alma mater Florida State. The move was heralded by recruiting director Steve Wiltfong; he said it was &quot;the biggest signing day moment in the history of college football&quot; as Football Championship Subdivision programs and the HBCUs that compete at such a level of competition are not usual destinations for high level recruits out of high school. Hunter was the first five-star recruit to sign with an FCS program. Not only did Sanders attract high-level recruits for HBCUs, he increased revenue for these once low funded teams and put HBCUs on the map. Sanders paid for meals and training facilities out of his own pocket.

===Colorado===
====2023 season====
On December 3, 2022, Sanders was named the head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes. Sanders made extensive use of the transfer portal in replacing nearly the Buffaloes&#x27; entire roster, with 46 players leaving in the transfer portal and 50 transferring in. Nine followed him from Jackson State, including sons Shedeur and Shilo, and former five-star recruit Hunter. After going 1–11 in the previous season, Colorado won their first three games of the 2023 season, then lost their next two, then recorded their only conference win of the season. Colorado finished the season 4–8 with a 1–8 record in Pac-12 play.

== Legacy and honors ==
During his 14-year NFL career, Sanders was a perennial All-Pro and considered by many as one of, if not the strongest pass defenders ever to play the game.

Sanders also occasionally lined up with the team&#x27;s offense. During the 1996 season, Sanders skipped the baseball season, concentrating on football, and attended the first NFL training camp of his career to better familiarize himself with the nuances of the wide receiver position. He became only the second two-way starter (after the Cardinals&#x27; Roy Green) in the NFL since Chuck Bednarik.

Sanders is the only man to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series, to hit an MLB home run and score an NFL touchdown in the same week, and to have both a reception and an interception in the Super Bowl. He is one of seven players to win back-to-back Super Bowls with different teams. He is also one of two players to score an NFL touchdown six different ways (interception return, punt return, kickoff return, receiving, rushing, and fumble recovery).

During his career, Sanders intercepted 53 passes for 1,331 yards (a 25.1 yards per return average), recovered four fumbles for 15 yards, returned 155 kickoffs for 3,523 yards, gained 2,199 yards on 212 punt returns, and caught 60 passes for 784 yards. Sanders amassed 7,838 all-purpose yards and scored 22 touchdowns, nine interception returns, six punt returns, three kickoff returns, three receiving, and one fumble recovery. His 19 defensive and return touchdowns was an NFL record (now held by Devin Hester with 20 return touchdowns). In the postseason Sanders added five more interceptions, as well as three receptions for 95 yards, four carries for 39 yards, and two touchdowns (one rushing and one receiving). He was selected to eight Pro Bowls and won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1994.

On February 6, 2011, at Super Bowl XLV in Arlington, Texas, Sanders performed the pre-game coin toss.

Sanders did not attend classes or take final exams during the fall semester (1988) of his senior year at Florida State, yet played in the Sugar Bowl against Auburn. This caused the state legislature to create the &quot;Deion Sanders rule&quot;, whereby a football athlete at any state university could not play in a bowl game if he failed to successfully complete the previous semester.

In , he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL&#x27;s salary cap. This caused the NFL to institute its own &quot;Deion Sanders rule&quot;, whereby a prorated portion of a player&#x27;s signing bonus counted against the salary cap.

== Media appearances and pop culture fame ==
Sanders became known for sporting a &quot;do-rag&quot; or bandana and for high-stepping into the end zone followed by his touchdown dance celebrations. 
At the end of his Hall of Fame speech, he put a bandana on his bust.

His &quot;Prime Time&quot; nickname was given to him by a friend and high-school teammate, Florida Gators defensive back Richard Fain. The two played pickup basketball games together during the prime time television hour, and Sanders&#x27; athletic display during those games earned him the nickname.

Sanders, wearing custom-made showy suits and flashy jewelry, capitalized on his image. On December 26, 1994, Sanders released &quot;Prime Time&quot;, a rap album on MC Hammer&#x27;s Bust It Records that featured the singles &quot;Must Be the Money&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Keeps on Tickin&#x27;&quot;. The album and singles didn&#x27;t chart in the Top 40. Following his first Super Bowl victory with the San Francisco 49ers, Sanders hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, broadcast on February 18, 1995. Sanders performed a medley of songs from &quot;Prime Time&quot;, including &quot;Must Be the Money&quot; and &quot;Heidi Heidi Hey&quot;.

As Hammer&#x27;s friend, Sanders appeared in the &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; music video, and his alter-ego &quot;Prime Time&quot; showed up in Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Pumps and a Bump&quot; music video. Hammer, being a big sports fan, launched a new enterprise called Roll Wit It Entertainment &amp; Sports Management which boasted such clients as Evander Holyfield, Deion Sanders and Reggie Brooks. In 1995, Hammer released &quot;Straight to My Feet&quot; with Sanders, from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; soundtrack (released in December 1994). The song charted No. 57 in the UK.

In January 1995, Sanders became the spokesman for the Sega Sports line of video games. Sanders has also appeared in television commercials for such companies as Nike, Pepsi, Burger King, Pizza Hut and American Express. These included a Road Runner Pepsi ad, with Sanders as the Road Runner with Wile E. Coyote targeting him, and a Pizza Hut commercial in which he appeared with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. He also makes a cameo as himself in the film &quot;Celtic Pride&quot;.

After retiring from the NFL in 2001, Sanders worked as a pre-game commentator for CBS&#x27; &quot;The NFL Today&quot; until 2004, when contract negotiations failed. Sanders turned down a 30% salary increase demanding to be paid $2.5 million, the highest of any NFL TV analyst. He was replaced by Shannon Sharpe. During Sanders&#x27; run, he participated in several sketches. The first was &quot;Primetime and 21st&quot;, a mock street corner where Sanders (not yet a regular panelist) would give his opinions. Another one was his &quot;Sanders Claus&quot; persona, one of numerous sketches that involved young kids in football jerseys, representing NFL players, receiving a sarcastic gift from Sanders. Sanders actually debuted as &quot;Sanders Claus&quot; in a set of Nike commercials.

Sanders frequently made guest appearances on ESPN, especially on the ESPN Radio Dallas affiliate, and briefly hosted a show called &quot;The New American Sportsman&quot;. He also hosted the 2002 Miss USA pageant.

Sanders co-hosted the 2004 GMA Dove Awards broadcast, taped in late April 2004, and slated for air on UPN in May 2004. When negotiations with fellow Viacom property &quot;The NFL Today&quot; failed two weeks before the broadcast, and he signed a deal with ESPN, UPN promptly canceled the broadcast, and the show aired on the i Network in December 2004 (both UPN and CBS are owned by CBS Corporation).

Sanders works at NFL Network as an analyst on a number of the network&#x27;s shows. Prior to the Sunday night game, Sanders, alongside host Rich Eisen and Steve Mariucci, breaks down all the action from the afternoon games on &quot;NFL GameDay&quot;. At the conclusion of all the action on Sunday, Sanders, Mariucci, Michael Irvin and host Fran Charles recap the day&#x27;s action with highlights, analysis and postgame interviews. For the 2010 season, Sanders joined Eisen, Mariucci and Marshall Faulk on the road for &quot;Thursday Night Kickoff presented by Lexus&quot;, NFL Network&#x27;s two-hour pregame show leading into &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;. The group broadcasts live from the stadium two hours prior to all eight live &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games and returns for the Sprint halftime show and Kay Jewelers postgame show. Sanders also has a segment called &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Primetime&quot; on NFL Network.

In 2008, Sanders and his wife starred in the reality show &quot;Deion &amp; Pilar: Prime Time Love&quot;, centering on them and their five children living in the small town of Prosper, Texas. That same year, he appeared with his family on &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; in the July 22, 2008, episode, competing against Caitlyn and Kris Jenner, Kim, Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian.

Sanders appeared as himself in the fourth season of &quot;The League&quot;, playing a prospective buyer of Andre&#x27;s apartment.

In 2014, Sanders was featured in an episode of &quot;Running Wild with Bear Grylls&quot;, where he and Grylls hiked in the desert of southern Utah for two days, rappelling down canyon walls and later climbing up a mesa.

Sanders served as an alumni captain for Team Sanders in the 2014 Pro Bowl. He also re-joined CBS Sports as a studio analyst for Thursday games only. He still works for the NFL Network on Sundays.

In 2015, he competed against singer Justin Bieber in an episode of Spike&#x27;s &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; and won with performances of &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; by Wild Cherry and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; by Madonna.

Sanders and his girlfriend Tracey Edmonds were featured together on an episode of &quot;Tiny House Nation&quot; that first aired on January 21, 2017.

In 2018, Sanders appeared in disguise on &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;; he met with youth coaches and the less fortunate; it aired on CBS.

Sanders is featured in the docuseries &quot;Coach Prime&quot;, which follows his career as a college football head coach.

=== Leon Sandcastle ===
Leon Sandcastle is a fictional character, depicted as a disguise for Sanders. The Sandcastle character was created for an NFL Network commercial. Sandcastle first appeared in a Super Bowl commercial in 2013. The commercial depicted Sanders suggesting he could still play at a level higher than the rookies in the 2013 NFL draft and deciding to make a comeback. He dons an afro, assumes the impromptu alias &quot;Leon Sandcastle&quot; and enters the draft, going through the full NFL Scouting Combine. For action shots, Ball State cornerback Andre Dawson served as the stunt double. The commercial features Sandcastle being drafted 1st overall in the draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. A voiceover then instructs viewers to watch NFL Network for offseason and draft coverage at the end noting in a deadpan voice that &quot;the next rookie sensation probably won&#x27;t be Leon Sandcastle.&quot;

Despite not being an actual prospect for the 2013 NFL Draft, several combine videos have been created. The most prominent of these videos is Sandcastle&#x27;s &quot;4.2 40 yard dash&quot;. The NFL also created a &quot;Combine Profile&quot; for Sandcastle, as they do with actual prospects. In Rich Eisen&#x27;s 2013 annual &#x27;Run Rich Run&#x27; event, Sandcastle appeared giving tips to Eisen. Sandcastle&#x27;s combine profile reveals that Sandcastle attended Primetime University. The commercial had a positive social media response as &quot;Leon Sandcastle&quot; was trending on Twitter worldwide, shortly after the commercial&#x27;s airing. Sandcastle was also put into &quot;Madden NFL 13&quot; as a card in the &#x27;Ultimate Team&#x27; game mode. For April Fools&#x27; Day, 2013, NFL.com reported that Sandcastle would be the Chiefs&#x27; first overall selection.
The character developed marketing value and continued to appear in headlines, such as a fake endorsement deal with Under Armour and continued to make other appearance at NFL events. Sandcastle also had football trading cards produced and inserted into products by Topps and Panini America.

==Other business and entertainment ventures==
In addition to his sports career, Sanders also had a career in music as a rapper. He released his debut album in 1994, &quot;Prime Time&quot;, through Hammer&#x27;s Bust It Records label via Capitol Records. In 1995, Hammer released &quot;Straight to My Feet&quot; with Sanders, from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; soundtrack (released in December 1994). The song charted No. 57 in the UK.

Sanders moved on to other ventures after his retirement. In 2003, Sanders took interest in Devin Hester, a return specialist from Miami. Sanders mentored Hester; he counselled and advised him during his collegiate career. The Chicago Bears drafted Hester in the second round of the 2006 NFL draft. Since then, Hester has broken the record for the most total returns for touchdowns in NFL history with 14 punt returns, 5 kick off returns, and 1 missed field goal return (20). Hester has cited Sanders as one of his major inspirations and idols, and thanked him for his training and advice. Hester, also known as &quot;Anytime&quot;, on occasion performed Sanders&#x27; signature touchdown dance and high-steps in homage to his mentor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hester_Q/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanders also tried to adopt a high school running back, Noel Devine, who was one of the top recruits in 2007. Sanders was advised against doing this but responded, &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have parents; they died. God put this young man in my heart. This is not about sports. This is about a kid&#x27;s life.&quot; He now mentors Devine, and was a factor in Devine&#x27;s extended wait to sign a letter-of-intent to West Virginia University. Devine eventually signed to play football for the Mountaineers.

Sanders has also been a mentor to Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Michael Crabtree, as well as former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, Dez Bryant.

In January 2004, Sanders was hired as an assistant coach to the Dallas Fury, a women&#x27;s professional basketball team in the National Women&#x27;s Basketball League, even though Sanders had never played organized basketball either in college or the professional level.

On September 2, 2005, in response to Hurricane Katrina, Sanders challenged all professional athletes in the four major sports to donate $1,000 each to relief efforts, hoping to raise between $1.5 and $3 million. Sanders said &quot;Through unity, we can touch thousands... I have friends and relatives that feel this pain. Help in any way you can.&quot; In April 2006, Sanders became an owner of the Austin Wranglers, an Arena Football League team.

Sanders has occasionally served as a celebrity spokesperson, such as representing Monitronics, a security system firm, at an industry conference in the spring of 2010.

On April 10, 2024, Sanders entered into an endorsement deal with Boost Mobile.

==Discography==
==Personal life==

Sanders has been married twice: He was married to Carolyn Chambers (1989–1998), with whom he had two children, Deiondra Sanders and Deion Sanders Jr. His second marriage was with Pilar Biggers-Sanders (1999–2015), with whom he has three children, Shilo, Shedeur, and Shelomi Sanders.

In 1997, Sanders was going through a dark time in his life when his first marriage was ending and said he attempted suicide by driving a car off a cliff in Cincinnati while playing for the Reds. He has said he was driving as fast as 70 m.p.h. when he drove his car off a 30-to-40-foot (about 9-to-12-meter) cliff but that &quot;there wasn&#x27;t a scratch on me or on the car.&quot;

Sanders, a Christian, said, &quot;I finally just got on my knees and gave it all to the Lord.&quot; He has also said that power, money, sex, and his success almost ruined his life; later writing an autobiography titled such.

The book was inspired after he began counseling with Bishop T. D. Jakes. He names his agent, Eugene Parker, as another person who has influenced his life.

In April 2012, a dispute between Sanders and his estranged wife, Pilar Sanders, led to Pilar and Deion both facing misdemeanor assault charges, but a judge later ruled that neither party had committed family violence in that instance. The former couple had a bitter custody dispute in 2013 over their three children, and a Texas jury voted to give Deion Sanders sole custody of their two sons and joint custody over their daughter. Pilar criticized the decision, saying that the judge had not allowed testimony about the 2012 dispute.

In 2012, Sanders co-founded the charter school Prime Prep Academy. Sanders was later fired as the coach after CFO Kevin Johnson alleged Sanders assaulted him. Sanders publicly denied the claim, but witnesses said he had grabbed the school official by the collar, causing him to fall. Sanders pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge and paid a $765.70 fine. Prime Prep Academy was criticized for a lack of focus on academics and poor management, and it shut down in 2015. The school had amassed debt, owing payments to the I.R.S. and a teachers&#x27; retirement fund, and, when it shut down, it did not have enough money to meet payroll.

In 2015, Sanders was named the CEO of FOCUS Academies and granted the head coaching position at Triple A Academy, which Sanders led to face his &quot;alma mater&quot; North Fort Myers High School in Florida, a game featuring a key matchup between several ranked recruits. On August 17, 2017, it was announced by CBS Sports that Sanders would be switching coaching positions at a new high school to become the offensive coordinator at Trinity Christian-Cedar Hill high school in Cedar Hill, Texas. The move was significant for Sanders, as both his sons played at the high school. Sanders served on the staff as offensive coordinator under former Dallas Cowboy Aveion Cason.

Two of his sons play football at University of Colorado: Shilo is a defensive back and Shedeur, is the starting quarterback. 

In 2020, Sanders graduated from Talladega College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration with an emphasis on organizational management.

In 2021, Sanders underwent several foot surgeries and had two toes on his left foot amputated as a result of blood clots.

<text>The Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue Project, or GODAR Project was established to increase the volume of historical oceanographic data available to climate change and other researchers. The project attempts to locate ocean profile and plankton data sets not yet in digital form, digitizes these data, and ensures their submission to national data centers and the World Data Center system (WDC). In addition, data on electronic media that are at risk of loss due to media degradation are also candidates for rescue.

==History==

In December 1992, the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) and WDC presented an initial proposal for the GODAR Project at the 14th Session of the Committee on International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) where it was approved. The proposal was subsequently endorsed by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)--the parent body of the IODE--at the 17th IOC Assembly held in March 1993. At that time, it was further agreed that the WDC for Oceanography in Silver Spring, Maryland, would lead this project.

All profile and plankton data acquired as part of the GODAR project were included in World Ocean Database 2001 (WOD01), which was released in March 2002.

<doc id="901149" wikidata="Q17027898" url="?curid=901149" title="Human-based genetic algorithm">
<text>In evolutionary computation, a human-based genetic algorithm (HBGA) is a genetic algorithm that allows humans to contribute solution suggestions to the evolutionary process. For this purpose, a HBGA has human interfaces for initialization, mutation, and recombinant crossover. As well, it may have interfaces for selective evaluation. In short, a HBGA outsources the operations of a typical genetic algorithm to humans.

==Evolutionary genetic systems and human agency==

Among evolutionary genetic systems, HBGA is the computer-based analogue of genetic engineering (Allan, 2005).
This table compares systems on lines of human agency:
One obvious pattern in the table is the division between organic (top) and computer systems (bottom).
Another is the vertical symmetry between autonomous systems (top and bottom) and human-interactive systems (middle).
Looking to the right, the &quot;selector&quot; is the agent that decides fitness in the system.
It determines which variations will reproduce and contribute to the next generation.
In natural populations, and in genetic algorithms, these decisions are automatic; whereas in typical HBGA systems, they are made by people.
The &quot;innovator&quot; is the agent of genetic change.
The innovator mutates and recombines the genetic material, to produce the variations on which the selector operates.
In most organic and computer-based systems (top and bottom), innovation is automatic, operating without human intervention.
In HBGA, the innovators are people.
HBGA is roughly similar to genetic engineering.
In both systems, the innovators and selectors are people.
The main difference lies in the genetic material they work with: electronic data vs. polynucleotide sequences.

==Differences from a plain genetic algorithm==

* All four genetic operators (initialization, mutation, crossover, and selection) can be delegated to humans using appropriate interfaces (Kosorukoff, 2001).
* Initialization is treated as an operator, rather than a phase of the algorithm. This allows a HBGA to start with an empty population. Initialization, mutation, and crossover operators form the group of innovation operators.
* Choice of genetic operator may be delegated to humans as well, so they are not forced to perform a particular operation at any given moment.

==Functional features==

* HBGA is a method of collaboration and knowledge exchange. It merges competence of its human users creating a kind of symbiotic human-machine intelligence (see also distributed artificial intelligence).
* Human innovation is facilitated by sampling solutions from population, associating and presenting them in different combinations to a user (see creativity techniques).
* HBGA facilitates consensus and decision making by integrating individual preferences of its users.
* HBGA makes use of a cumulative learning idea while solving a set of problems concurrently. This allows to achieve synergy because solutions can be generalized and reused among several problems. This also facilitates identification of new problems of interest and fair-share resource allocation among problems of different importance.
* The choice of genetic representation, a common problem of genetic algorithms, is greatly simplified in HBGA, since the algorithm need not be aware of the structure of each solution. In particular, HBGA allows natural language to be a valid representation.
* Storing and sampling population usually remains an algorithmic function.
* A HBGA is usually a multi-agent system, delegating genetic operations to multiple agents (humans).

==Applications==

* Evolutionary knowledge management, integration of knowledge from different sources.
* Social organization, collective decision-making, and e-governance.
* Traditional areas of application of interactive genetic algorithms: computer art, user-centered design, etc.
* Collaborative problem solving using natural language as a representation.
* Education and Academic benefits from Real Time Simulation with Synthetic Curriculum Modeling using Dynamic Point Cloud environments.

The HBGA methodology was derived in 1999-2000 from analysis of the Free Knowledge Exchange project that was launched in the summer of 1998, in Russia (Kosorukoff, 1999). Human innovation and evaluation were used in support of collaborative problem solving. Users were also free to choose the next genetic operation to perform. Currently, several other projects implement the same model, the most popular being Yahoo! Answers, launched in December 2005.

Recent research suggests that human-based innovation operators are advantageous not only where it is hard to design an efficient computational mutation and/or crossover (e.g. when evolving solutions in natural language), but also in the case where good computational innovation operators are readily available, e.g. when evolving an abstract picture or colors (Cheng and Kosorukoff, 2004). In the latter case, human and computational innovation can complement each other, producing cooperative results and improving general user experience by ensuring that spontaneous creativity of users will not be lost.

Furthermore, human-based genetic algorithms prove to be a successful measure to counteract fatigue effects introduced by interactive genetic algorithms.

<text>Cainta, officially the Municipality of Cainta (, ), is a municipality in the province of Rizal, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 376,933 people.

It is one of the oldest municipalities in Luzon (founded on August 15, 1571) and has a land area of .

As the country&#x27;s 3rd most populous municipality after Taytay, Rizal and Rodriguez, Rizal, efforts are underway to convert it into a city. Its total assets amounting to (as per 2017 Commission on Audit summary) makes it the richest municipality in the country in terms of income. However, Cainta faces different challenges especially with its boundary disputes with Pasig (Greenpark Village, Karangalan Village, St. Joseph Subdivision, Villarica Subdivision, Riverside and Midtown Village), Taytay, (Greenland and eastern part of Cainta) and Antipolo (Valley Golf and Country Club and Valley View), thus hindering cityhood efforts.

==Etymology==
Cainta was already a village named Cainta when the Spanish first arrived in the 1570s, recorded in Spanish records as Cáinta or Caynta. Its etymology is unknown.

==History==
===The Battle of Cainta===

After the death of Rajah Matanda, Adelantado Miguel de Legaspi received word that two ships, San Juan and Espiritu Santo, had just arrived in Panay Island in the central Philippines from Mexico. One ship was under the command of Don Diego de Legaspi, his nephew, and the other of Juan Chacon. The two ships were in such disrepair when they arrived in Panay that one of them was not allowed to return to Mexico. Legaspi ordered that it be docked on the river of Manila. The Maestro de Campo was sent to Panay to oversee its transfer to Manila, with Juan de la Torre as captain.

To help spread the faith, several Augustinian friars were commissioned by Spain and were among the ship&#x27;s passengers. One of them was Father Alonso de Alvarado, who had been in the &quot;armada&quot; of Villalobos. Another was Father Agustin de Albuquerque, who became the first parish priest of Taal town, south of Manila. Some of the missionaries were sent to Cebu province in the central Philippines to accompany Father Martin de Rada the Prior. Four stayed to work in Pampanga province and the environs north and south of Manila, which included the then-village of Cainta.

Meanwhile, Legaspi was determined to subjugate the people of Cainta and Taytay, a neighboring town. He sent his nephew Juan de Salcedo with a galleon (a small ship propelled by oars and sails) and 16 small boats accompanied by a hundred Spanish soldiers and many Visayas natives allied with them. Salcedo sailed on August 15, 1571, arriving in Cainta on the 20th. He sought peace from the villagers but the village chiefs responded arrogantly, told him that the people of Cainta, unlike those of Manila, were not cowards, and would defend their village to the death. Confident in the defenses offered by their fort and the security of the site, they were joined by people from Taytay.

These two villages are on a plain on the shores of a river that flows from La Laguna and before arriving there divides in two large arms, both with abundant water. On its banks are found the two villages, half a league from each other, with the river passing through both before finally becoming one in a part of the terrain encircled by thick bamboo groves. These bamboos were tied together with &quot;liana&quot;, turning them into a thick wall where the people had constructed two ramparts with their moats full of water. By the river, they had built strong stone bulwarks with wooden towers and good artillery (culverins or lantakas), guarded by a large number of warriors armed with arrows, swords and other projectile-type arms.

Deciding to attack, Salcedo first sent Second Lieutenant Antonio de Carvajal with some escorts to reconnoiter the town and determine the weakest point where they could enter. Carvajal, wounded by an arrow in his arm, returned with the information that the weakest spot, the least fortified and with the easiest access was the other part of an arroyo on the side of La Laguna where many boats could be seen entering the river.

Salcedo ordered installed in the prow of the galley a stone-throwing mortar. He and his men then spent the night on shore, while 20 soldiers and numerous allies from Manila remained with Carvajal on the galley with orders that when they heard firing, they should proceed with the attack on the stone bulwarks and the houses in the town, while Salcedo and his men tried to enter through the wall by the arroyo. When they heard the sound of the bugle, the signal that they had taken the town, they were to stop firing.

After giving these instructions, Salcedo began his march and turned toward the river where the attack was to take place. He arrived in the arroyo and found it defended by a group of Cainta warriors who started to fire arrows and hurl lances.

Taken by surprise, the soldiers without waiting for Salcedo&#x27;s order attacked the rampart and were overwhelmed by a rain of arrows. Finding such tenacious resistance, they began to retreat and flee in disarray.

Salcedo berated his men harshly for having attacked without his orders. Observing that in the other part of the arroyo the rampart was lower, he ordered a skiff brought there and after beaching it, he ordered some of his soldiers to use it as passage to the other side and take a more elevated point from where they could fire at the defenders of the town.

With the defenders retreating, Salcedo and his men were able to approach the wall and breach it. Cainta men came to close the breach, forcing Saavedra to back off.

In the meantime, the cannons of the galley destroyed the stone bulwarks and the houses in the town in a manner the people had not seen before. The shouts of the 600 Visayans allied with the Spanish made the natives believe that the Spaniards were already inside the &quot;poblacion&quot; [town proper]. Because of this, defenders of the breach abandoned it and retreated to the center of the town.

Salcedo observed this from a distance and ordered the breach attacked again. This time, the Spaniards encountered little resistance. Led by Salcedo and with Saavedra carrying the Spanish banner, they succeeded in entering the town. Together with their soldiers, they advanced rapidly and shortly scaled the wall where a bloody battle was fought.

The Cainta men preferred to die rather than surrender. Having taken over the stone walls, the Spaniards climbed the towers and hoisted the Spanish banner. At the blare of the bugle, the cannons stopped firing from the galley.

===Spanish rule===

Founded on November 30, 1571, Cainta was a fiercely independent village that fought valiantly against the Spaniards but was later defeated and became a &quot;visita&quot; (annex) of Taytay in 1571 under the Jesuits. Changes in ecclesiastical administration made Cainta a part of Pasig under the Augustinians but it was deeded back to the Jesuits by the King of Spain in 1696. Cainta became a separate township in 1760.

====Conversion to Catholicism====
The chief religion is Roman Catholicism. When the Spaniards arrived, they celebrated the feast of St. Andrew the Apostle and a mass was held in a chapel made of nipa palm branches and wood. Many people came to attend and consequently were baptized into the faith.

The Church of Cainta was completed in 1715. It was gutted during World War II. Only the outer walls and the facade remained which was repaired with a coat of Portland cement. In 1727, an image depicting Our Lady of Light was brought to Cainta from Sicily, Italy, and was among the structures destroyed by Japanese and the joint American and Filipino bombs. Except for the outer walls, now greatly renovated, hardly anything remains of the old church. Extensive damage was also caused by recurrent earthquakes and typhoons that plagued the Philippines. The natives helped in its restoration and the new building was completed on February 25, 1968, and blessed by Manila Cardinal Archbishop Rufino Jiao Santos.

Cainta became an independent town in 1760. During the brief British occupation of Luzon (1762–1763), part of its British India troops known as Sepoys lived and intermarried with the natives in one of the town&#x27;s barrios. The Indian left a culinary legacy in the spicy and highly seasoned dishes that are now part of mainstream Cainta cuisine. Cainta became part of Tondo (starting 1763) but separated in 1883 and incorporated with the district of Morong.

===American colonial era===
====March 16, 1899====

Exequiel Ampil was assigned by Emilio Aguinaldo to liberate Cainta.

Maj. William P. Rogers, CO of the 3rd Battalion, 20th US Infantry Regiment, came upon the Filipinos in Cainta, about 1,000 strong, and forced them to retreat. He burned the town. Two Americans were killed and 14 wounded, while the Filipinos suffered about 100 killed and wounded.

Upon the approach of the Americans, Exequiel Ampil y Dela Cruz, the Presidente Municipal of Cainta and a former Agente Especial of the Katipunan who had become a pronounced Americanista, strongly advised the Filipino soldiers to surrender. Instead, they shot him. Although wounded, Ampil managed to escape.

On March 3, 1902, major American newspapers including &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;…Felizardo, at the head of twenty-five men armed with rifles, entered the town of Cainta and captured the Presidente of Cainta, Señor Ampil, and a majority of the police of the town. Señor Ampil has long been known as an enthusiastic American sympathizer, and it is feared that he may be killed by the enraged ladrones (thieves &amp; land grabbers). A strong force of constabulary has been sent to try to effect his release.&quot; In actuality, Timoteo Pasay was the leader of the guerilla band that kidnapped Ampil on Feb 28, 1902.

On March 4, 1902, near the hills of Morong town, Ampil found an opportunity to escape. A detachment of constabulary was taken from the garrison at Pasig and stationed at Cainta for his protection, he survived the war. And upon retiring from his military and political career, Don Exequiel Ampil together with his wife Doña Priscila Monzon, applied and managed their vast estate from corner of Ortigas Ave. and C. Raymundo Ave., Brgy. Rosario, Pasig City, to Cainta River (San Jose, Cainta) up to the Valley Golf area (Brgy. Mambugan, Antipolo City, Rizal) down to Ortigas Extension (San Isidro, Taytay). The lots were the old and the new Municipal Halls stands, were also part of his estate.

Their son Dr. Jesus Ampil also became a Mayor (grandfather of the Ampil Brothers in Bacolod City); whose siblings where Lumen, Atty. Vicente (of Pasay), Rosario &amp; Jose.

====Inclusion in Rizal province====
On October 12, 1903, under the American rule, Cainta and Angono were consolidated with Taytay as one government entity. On January 1, 1914, it once again became an independent municipality and remained so to this day.

===World War II===
In 1942, Japanese Occupation troops entered Cainta. In 1942 to 1944, local guerrilla groups of the Hunters ROTC was the four-year main invasions in Cainta against the Japanese, when the guerrillas were retreating by the Japanese before the liberation. In 1945, local Filipino troops of the 4th, 42nd, 45th, 46th, 47th and 53rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary started the liberation and captured Cainta and helped the guerrilla resistance fighters of the Hunters ROTC Guerrillas to fight against the Japanese and ended World War II.

====Liberation of Cainta====
During World War II under the Allied Liberation, the some of all stronghold of local Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th, 42nd, 45th, 46th, 47th and 53rd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 4th Constabulary Regiment was sending the local military operations and liberated in all municipal town of Cainta and aided the local guerrilla groups of the Hunters ROTC Guerrillas against the Japanese Imperial armed forces and begins the Liberation of Cainta in 1945 and arrival by the American liberation forces enters the town.

===Post-war===
On May 9, 1992, a fire broke out at the town&#x27;s municipal hall two days before the 1992 local elections. The Rizal Provincial Police Command concluded that the fire was accidental, having been caused by a negligent janitor, although the PNP Criminal Investigation Service Command (CISC) refuted this, citing eyewitness accounts to the contrary. By August 1993, Secretary of Justice Franklin Drilon ordered the reopening of the case due to evidence found to be conflicting with the initial conclusions by a team of prosecutors at the Department of Justice.

==Geography==
Cainta is bounded on the north by Marikina and Antipolo, on the west by Pasig, and on the east and south by Taytay. It lies in the Marikina Valley, is 10% rolling hills and 90% residential-industrial. It has the province&#x27;s highest number of rivers and streams. Historians claim that Cainta&#x27;s old geographical boundaries encompassed the mountain slopes of Montalban.

Cainta is from Manila and from Antipolo.

Cainta serves as the secondary gateway to the rest of Rizal province from Metro Manila. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, Cainta is now part of Manila&#x27;s conurbation, which reaches Cardona in its easternmost part and is therefore one of the most urbanized towns.

===Barangays===

Cainta is politically subdivided into seven barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* San Andres (Poblacion)
* San Isidro
* San Juan
* San Roque
* Santa Rosa
* Santo Domingo
* Santo Niño

In the mid-1990s, Cainta submitted a petition to the Rizal provincial government to consider a proposal for 18 additional barangays, to make a total of 25 barangays. The proposal is still pending.

=== Climate ===
==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, the population of Cainta, was 376,933 people, with a density of .

In the 2007 census, it had a population of 304,478. Its population consists of 70% Roman Catholic Christians, 15% Non-Catholic Christians (including Baptists, Evangelicals, Iglesia ni Cristo, Members Church of God International, Aglipayan, Jesus Is Lord, and others), 10% Muslims, 3% Chinese Buddhists, and 2% Sikhs. The people of Cainta are mostly Tagalog-speaking Filipinos.

A considerable number of the population are descended from Indian soldiers who mutinied against the British Army when the British briefly occupied the Philippines in 1762 to 1763. These Indian soldiers called Sepoy were Tamil people from Chennai and settled in town and intermarried with native women. The Sepoy ancestry of Cainta is still very visible to this day, particularly in Barrio Dayap near Barangay Sto. Niño.

==Economy==


Cainta is a highly urbanized town, which has an abundant mix of commercial, industrial, and real estate businesses. As of 2018&#x27;s Commission on Audit report, the town is the richest municipality in the country in terms of total assets. Cainta continues to attract businesses due to its proximity to Manila and the town&#x27;s burgeoning population.

===Native delicacies===
Cainta is known for its native delicacies, a tradition inherited from nearby Antipolo, which is largely a cottage industry. Dating back to the 15th century, it became the town&#x27;s principal source of income for more than four centuries. &quot;Suman&quot; (rice cake wrapped in banana leaf), &quot;latik&quot; (boiled down coconut milk used for glazing), coconut jam and the &quot;bibingka&quot; are some of the sweet delicacies that have been popular with visitors to the town.

During the 20th century, Cainta dazzled the whole country when it baked the biggest rice cake ever and the town became known as the &quot;Bibingka Capital of the Philippines&quot;. &quot;Bibingka&quot; is believed to have been adapted from the Indian cuisine, an influence from its Sepoy population. It comes from the Indian word bebinca also known as &quot;bibik&quot;, a dessert made of flour, coconut milk, and egg. The Philippine version is made of rice flour, coconut milk, and salted duck eggs. Butter and sugar are used for glazing after cooking and before serving.

==Culture==
During Cainta&#x27;s modernization period, traditions became more glamorous, most especially during the Lenten season. The most noteworthy rituals are the &quot;Cenakulo&quot; (a stage play of the passion and death of Christ) and the &quot;Ang Pagpapapako&quot; or &quot;Penetencia&quot; (a re-enactment of the crucifixion of Christ).

===The Cenakulo===
The &quot;Senakulo&quot; in Cainta dates back to 1904. It originated from Barrio Dayap (the entire area now includes Barangays Santa Rosa, Sto Niño and Santo Domingo). At that time, the population consisted of a small group of residents who were mostly related to each other. Since most of the people believed that calamities were brought in by evil spirits, they decided to put up a cross on a vacant lot to counter them. The barrio people paid homage to the cross by lighting it every night. One memorable incident happened during the Lenten season when a strange fragrance supposedly emanated from the cross. The news spread out not only in the barrio but also in the entire town of Cainta.

Believing in the mystery of the cross, many people in Barrio Dayap and the whole town of Cainta have since then vowed to read the &quot;Pasyon&quot; (Seven Last Words of Christ) every Lenten season. This has been enriched by an actual portrayal of the Passion of Christ on the streets which was formerly called &quot;Officio&quot;. Many problems have been allegedly solved and illnesses cured through the cross as many people continuously believed.

Over the years the followers of the cross have multiplied rapidly. To give deeper meaning to their devotion and showcase their religiosity, they broached the idea of staging the &quot;Pasyon&quot;. The first stage play was held a few years later, although initially it was limited in scope. It became so popular that the presentation was expanded to include stories from the Old Testament and other stages in the life of Christ and has become known as the &quot;Cenakulo&quot;. The venue was transferred to an open field in 1966 to accommodate a larger audience.

Krus Sa Nayon, Inc. (KSNI) was established as early as 1900 during and after Spanish era. The group was also known for its extravagant preparation and passion play every night of the Holy Week period. The KSNI cenakulo play was previously held at the Jaika Compound beside the municipal building and Francisco P. Felix Memorial National High School. To date, the play is held at the stage beside the municipal ground, alongside the One Cainta Police Headquarters and One Cainta Fire Department.

Samahang Nazareno Inc. was organized in 1960, developed and enhanced the various aspects of &quot;cenakulo&quot;. The local Roman Catholic parishioner gave the association its moral and financial support for it believed that it was an effective means of imparting its Christian message to the public.

===Cainta Day===

Every December 1, the town celebrates its foundation and feast of Our Lady of Light (Ina ng Kaliwanagan). It is celebrated with its own festival, SumBingTik (portmanteau of suman, bibingka, and latik), which started around 2014. The week long celebration consists of various activities such as paint ball tournament, battle of the bands, Miss Cainta beauty pageant, and Caindakan sa Kalsada, a street dance parade joined by local schools and organizations.

<text>Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom is an honorary office generally held by a senior Royal Navy admiral. The title holder is the official deputy to the Lord High Admiral, an honorary (although once operational) office which was vested in the Sovereign from 1964 to 2011 and which was subsequently held by the Duke of Edinburgh. Vice-Admirals are appointed by the Sovereign on the nomination of the First Sea Lord.

==History==
The office was originally created on 25 April 1513, by Tudor King Henry VIII. The office holder served as the deputy of the Lord High Admiral from April 1546 when the incumbent jointly held the title of Lieutenant of the Admiralty, though not always simultaneously. From 1557 to 1558 Vice-Admiral Sir John Clere of Ormesby, Kt. was appointed Vice-Admiral of England by patent but not appointed Lieutenant of the Admiralty. The post was in abeyance until 1661; from then on, appointments became more regular and in 1672 the two separate distinct offices were amalgamated into one unified office, though both titles remained. The responsibilities of the pre-1964 Board of Admiralty would, in theory, have devolved upon the Vice-Admiral had the entire Board been incapacitated before a new Commission of Admiralty could pass the Great Seal. However, such a contingency never occurred in practice.

In former days, the Vice-Admiral of England (or Vice-Admiral of Great Britain following the 1707 union with Scotland) was the second most powerful position in the Royal Navy, and until 1801 was officially called the Lieutenant of the Admiralty.

Below the office of Vice-Admiral ranks the Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, another now honorary office.

<text>Narsinghpur is a city in Madhya Pradesh in central India. It is a district under Jabalpur division. Narsinghpur has a large temple dedicated to Lord Narasimha. As of 2001, Narsinghpur is the most literate district of the state.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
The earliest signs of human life in Narsinghpur were found recently in the caves of Vinaiki village 
(Narsinghpur) which lies on the banks of Shakkar river (tributary of Narmada), in the hinterlands of Kareli Forest Zone (a part of Satpura reserve) in Narsinghpur. Most of the villagers are Gonds and they knew about the paintings for a long time. Locals call the rock paintings found in their village by the name &#x27;Putra Putariya&#x27; (पुतरा पुतरिया).The actual age of the rock paintings is not yet determined. Analysis by the Department of Archaeology is awaited.

The axe, bow and arrows, and swords can be seen in the pictures. The rock paintings depict humans riding and playing with horses and elephants. Humans are also seen hunting animals like deers. Sheep, Wild boar, Buffaloes, and Barahsingha can also be seen. One of the rock paintings is of humans with armed axes and a peculiar headgear. Some of the paintings are of a clear red color similar to those found in Bhimbetika, while some are gray. Pictures have also been described in some script which is yet to be identified. It is within the radius of 150 kilometers from the Bhimbetka rockshelters of Raisen and about 100 km away from Adamgadh hills.

===The Satavahana period===
This area was a part of the Satavahana Empire from the 2nd to the 4th centuries CE, after which, it was annexed into the Gupta Empire during the reign of the Emperor Samudragupta. There is some historical evidence for Padi rule. There is no record of this area until the 9th century CE, when the Kalachuri kingdom was established. The Kalchuri capital was near the Narmada river, later established at Tripuri.

=== Gond Vansh===
After the establishment of Raj Gond Vansh, an era of peace and prosperity began in the area. This Vansh came to existence by Yadav Rao, who laid the foundation of a strong kingdom at a place called Garha–Katanga and started a process of strong mighty rule. One of the rulers, Sangram Shah (1500–1541) had established 52 Garh, of the Gond Dynasty. The fort of Chauragarh (Chougan) at Narsinghpur was constructed by Sangram Shah, which is still an evidence of bravery of Veer Narayan. He was son of Queen Rani Durgawati.

Among the followers of Sangram Shah, Dalpati Shah ruled for a period of 7 years peacefully. After, this Queen Durgawati took the reign and gave a proof of courage or bravery, and ruled for a period of 16 years (1540—1564). In 1564, the Queen died, while fighting bravely, giving a tough fight to Asaf Khan, the Sepoy Salar of King Akbar. In Narsinghpur district, at the castle fort of Chauragarh, Asaf Khan trapped prince Veer Narayan and killed him with his cunning tactics. Thus Garha Katanga came under control of Mugals in 1564, Gonds Mugals. After then the area was under control of various officers and administrative or hereditary chiefs during the Maratha&#x27;s rule. The boundaries of the area continued to change according to the powers and influence of their people. Chawarpatha, Barha, Saikheda, Gadarwara, Shahpur, Singhpur, Shrinagar, and Tendukheda were headquarters of various parganas

In 18 century the ruler of Narsinghpur Thakur ji was killed by British rulers and the fort of narsinghpur was totally destroyed. There are a number of sites of interest to archaeologists in the area, as the area has been inhabited since the second century AD, according to historical documents from that time. Narsinghpur has a number of sacred sites, including a nearby cave associated with Adi Guru Shankracharya&#x27;s place of meditations and studies. The Gonds also called Parakarti Pujak

===Bhonsle Rulers===
In 1785, Madhavji Bhonsle purchased the area of Mandla and Narmada Ghati in 27 lakhs. The area was under pressure of army rule during the reign of Raghuji Bhonsle, Nawab of Bhopal and Pindari. Due to unsuitability of the ruler and other problems, the common people were extremely exploited. This period was also known as a period of problems and instability. However, after the defeat of Bhosles in Battle of Sitabuldi in 1817, British rule came into existence in the area.

===British period===
After the Battle of Sitabuldi, this area came under the control of British rule in 1817, which was confirmed by an alliance in 1826. In this period the area was known as Gadarwara pargana, with Chichli and Gangai. The Gond Jagirs were under Marathas, where as Sindhiya had given Barha and Paloha Jagirs to Pindari Sardars, Chitu and Karim Khan. In 1818, the British army captured the fort of Chauragarh, and in 1830 the control of this area was given to a committee. During British rule, the administration of this district improved, and in 1836 the area was partitioned and was merged in Hoshangabad district. But after Bundela revolt in 1843, this part was once again reinstated in this district.

===Struggle for independence===
Despite strong British rule, the desire for independence was prevalent among the common people. In 1825, Chawarpatha and Tendukheda were given to the British Government. In 1857 the police station of Chawarpatha and Tendukheda were captured by revolutionaries under the leadership of Gond Chief Delan Shah of Madanpur. With this, the struggle for independence was started. But in 1858, Delan Shah was caught and hanged to death. Thus in the year British curbed the struggle for independence, and they succeeded in establishing their rule. After 1899, Shayam Bihari Nagaria had a big hand in Independence Of Narsinghpur. Unfortunately, he died in December 2007.

===Congress movement===
After the establishment of Indian National Congress in 1885, even in this district, the feeling for Independence was prevalent. Strong efforts were made by the people here, being motivated by the efforts and leadership of Lokmanya Tilak, Subhas Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi, and Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru. Among the leaders of his district were Gayadutt, Manik Lal Kochar, Choudhary Shankar Lal and Nitiraj Singh(were imprisoned in Sewani jail),Rudrapratap Singh(martyred by British) Gopal Das Kathal, Thakur Niranjan Singh ,( Mushran family donated to British War fund)who led the people of this district towards the Independence movements. In order to break the unity and enthusiasm of the people, the British had once again partitioned the district and merged it with Hoshangabad district. However, even then, enthusiasm as well as the fight for independence continued in the people&#x27;s minds. During the mass demonstration of satyagrah at Chichli in 1932, Mansharam and Gauradevi lost their lives during police firing. One more incident transpired with one stouthearted liberation fighter, Ramkumar Badal, from village Bamhani, who was customarily involved in multiple protests was caught and charged under different sections after licit efforts, he went out and made a minuscule group of people in a town denominated Barman to protest against enforcement made by Britishers, which influenced multiple people near the town, and then the protest gained more reach and accolade, which made it more vigorous enough to win an aside, and so the executive officer appointed in that block was coerced to transmute the rules. This was a great triumph that influenced and incentivized people far away to fight for freedom.

Thousands of revolutionaries faced the atrocities of British rule and gave an example of strong devotion for the country, and snipe against the British rule. When the country gained Independence in 1947, on 15 August, a new era started in this district. After 9 years of independence, when states were reorganized on the basis of languages, Narsinghpur, once again, became a district. Since 1 November 1956, Narsinghpur district has been moving towards progress and prosperity in its full existence.

<text>Mark Derwin (born October 28, 1960) is an American film and television actor. Derwin began his career on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in 1987 with a minor role as Jeremiah Brown. In 1988, Derwin appeared in the role of Adrian Hunter on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Derwin was featured in a high-profile storyline: the elaborate George Rawlins murder mystery as the scheming psychotic serial killer. Derwin is also known for numerous other soap opera roles. From 2008-2013 Derwin was a lead on the ABC Family teen drama the &quot;Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; as George Juergens, a furniture store owner married to Molly Ringwald&#x27;s character Ann, and the father of the main character Amy played by Shailene Woodley. The main plot of the show is Derwin&#x27;s character&#x27;s 15-year old daughter having a child after a one night stand at a summer band camp and the developments this event has on those around her.

==Biography==
Derwin attended the State University of New York at Cobleskill, but was kicked out after one semester. He briefly worked at IBM and worked a series of odd jobs before moving to Los Angeles. 

After recurring roles on the shows &quot;Hardball&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and a prolific career in commercials (including a notable spot as the &quot;Fiesta&quot; cigarette man in Mexico), Derwin was cast in his first contract role as Adrian Hunter on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Derwin was on the show from 1989 to 1990, and was featured in a high-profile storyline where his character played a grifter and, ultimately, a murderer.

His next role was on the long-running soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as detective A.C. Mallet. Derwin played the character from 1990 to 1993. During his time there, the role of Mallet became a leading character. Derwin became romantically involved with costar Beth Ehlers during his stint at GL; the couple decided to leave the show together in 1993. (Derwin and Ehlers subsequently broke up.)

Derwin returned to daytime television in the role of Dr. Ben Davidson on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1999–2002, 2004, 2008). He was again paired in a high-profile leading role, this time as the love interest of the show&#x27;s star, Erika Slezak. His character was eventually discovered to be the son of show patriarch Asa Buchanan.

Derwin co-starred alongside Bonnie Hunt in the non-traditional primetime sitcom,
&quot;Life with Bonnie&quot;, which was partly improvised. He recently was seen in the teen comedy &quot;Accepted&quot; (2006), playing the father of protagonist Bartleby Gaines (played by Justin Long).

In 2006, 2007 and 2014, he was seen on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, playing Greg. Derwin also played George Juergens on the ABC Family TV show &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; from 2008 to 2013. In 2008, he appeared on the show &quot;Chuck&quot; on the episode &quot;Chuck Versus the Marlin&quot; where he played Detective Conway. In 2009 he had a recurring role on season 7 of &quot;24&quot; as Secretary of State Joe Stevens, a member of President Allison Taylor&#x27;s (played by Cherry Jones) Cabinet. In 2011, he appeared on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; in the episode &quot;How I Met My Mother&quot;, playing a paroled convict. In 2013, Derwin portrayed Pierre Cossette in &quot;To Have and To Hold&quot;, episode 4 of season 6 of &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

<doc id="901161" wikidata="Q9672887" url="?curid=901161" title="Rígsþula">
<text>Rígsþula or Rígsmál (Old Norse: &#x27;The Lay of Ríg&#x27;) is an Eddic poem, preserved in the manuscript (AM 242 fol, the Codex Wormianus), in which a Norse god named Ríg or Rígr, described as &quot;old and wise, mighty and strong&quot;, fathers the social classes of mankind. The prose introduction states that Rígr is another name for Heimdall, who is also called the father of mankind in &quot;Völuspá&quot;. However, there seems to be some confusion of Heimdall and Odinn, see below.

In &quot;Rígsþula&quot;, Rig wanders through the world and fathers the progenitors of the three classes of human beings as conceived by the poet. The youngest of these sons, Jarl, inherits the name or title &quot;Ríg&quot; and so in turn does his youngest son, Kon the Young or &quot;Kon ungr&quot; (, king). This third Ríg was the first true king and the ultimate founder of the state of royalty as appears in the &quot;Rígsþula&quot; and in two other associated works. In all three sources he is connected with two primordial Danish rulers named Dan and Danþír.

The poem &quot;Rígsþula&quot; is preserved incomplete on the last surviving sheet in the 14th-century &quot;Codex Wormianus&quot;, following Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. A short prose introduction explains that the god in question was Heimdall, who wandered along the seashore until he came to a farm where he called himself Ríg. The name Rígr appears to be the oblique case of Old Irish &quot;rí&quot;, &quot;ríg&quot; &quot;king&quot;, cognate to Latin &quot;rex&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;rajan&quot;. and Gothic &quot;reiks&quot;.

The identification of Rígr with Heimdall is supported by his characterization as an ancestor, or kinsman, of humankind in the first two lines of the Eddic poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;:&#x27;
:I ask for a hearing
:of all the holy races
:Greater and lesser
:kinsmen of Heimdall

However, some scholars, including Finnur Jónsson and Rudolf Simek, have suggested this is a role more appropriate to Óðinn and that the Eddic tradition has thus transferred the name Rígr from him to Heimdall. Since &quot;Rígsþula&quot; is only preserved in a 14th-century manuscript, it is also plausible that the prose introduction was added by the compiler to conform it to the opening of &quot;Völuspá&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

Rígr was walking along the shore and came to a farm-hut owned by Ái (great-grandfather) and Edda (great-grandmother). They offered him shelter and poor, rough food for a meal. That night Rígr slept between the pair in their bed and then departed. Nine months later, Edda gave birth to a son who was &quot;svartr&quot; (swarthy, dark). They named him Þræll (thrall, serf, or slave). Þræll grew up strong but ugly. He married a woman named Thír (slave girl or bondswoman), and they had twelve sons and nine daughters with names mostly suggesting ugliness and squatness. They became the race of serfs.

Traveling further, Rígr came across a pleasant house where a farmer/craftsman, Afi (grandfather), lived with his wife Amma (grandmother). This couple gave him good food and also let him sleep between them. Nine months later, a son, Karl (churl or freeman), was born, who had a ruddy complexion. Karl married a woman named Snör or Snœr (daughter-in-law; sometimes anglicized as Snor), and they had twelve sons and ten daughters with names mostly suggesting a neat appearance or being of good quality. One of the names is &quot;smiðr&quot; (smith). These became the ancestors of free farmers, craftsmen and herdsmen.

Traveling further, Rígr came to a mansion inhabited by Faðir (Father) and Móðir (Mother). They gave him excellent food served splendidly and, nine months later, Móðir gave birth to a beautiful baby named Jarl (earl or noble), whose hair was blond and who was &quot;bleikr&quot; (bright white in color). When Jarl grew up and began to handle weapons and to use hawks, hounds, and horses, Rígr reappeared, claimed him as his son, gave him his own name of Rígr, made him his heir, taught him runes, and advised him to seek lordship.

Through warfare Jarl became lord of eighteen homesteads with much wealth besides. He also gained the hand of Erna (Brisk), daughter of Hersir (lord). Erna bore twelve sons to Ríg-Jarl but no daughters. All the sons were given high-sounding names, mostly meaning &quot;son&quot;. They became the ancestors of the warrior nobility.

The youngest son, named Konr, was the best of them. He alone learned rune-craft as well as other magic and was able to understand the speech of birds, to quench fire, and to heal minds. He also had the strength of eight normal men. His name was Konr the young (&quot;Konr ungr&quot; in Old Norse), the name and title to be understood as the origin of the Norse word &quot;konungr&quot; (king). Konr, like his father, also acquired the name or title of Rígr.

One day, when Konr the young was riding through the forest hunting and snaring birds, a crow spoke to him and suggested he would win more if he stopped hunting mere birds and rode to battle against foemen, that he should seek the halls of Dan and Danþír, who were wealthier than he. At that point the poem abruptly cuts off.

== Historical significance ==
A key aspect of historical scholarship on this poem is that theories of date and provenance range from the tenth to the thirteenth century and from the Old Norse-Icelandic-speaking areas of the British Isles to Norway. Initially it was viewed as an ancient poem; later research postulated that it came from the thirteenth century, but some modern scholars continue to place it as early as the Viking Age. Additionally, the dating problem is complicated by the poem&#x27;s history of oral transmission, which tends to warp pieces as long as the &quot;Rígsþula&quot; as they are recited numerous times. In terms of provenance, although there has been some speculation in the past as to Celtic authorship of the poem, the modern consensus is to ascribe Icelandic authorship to it.

The historical significance of the poem would necessarily change based on where in history the text itself is situated. There is of course a need to remember the literary nature of the poem when reading it as a historical source as certain aspects do not translate literally and must be read allegorically and stereotypically. For example, despite the explicit and detailed physical differences between the classes in the poem, slaves, freeman, and aristocrats did not necessarily look different. Thus although qualitative aspects of the social classes are difficult to determine from the text, there is broader understanding that can be gained.

Firstly, the poem presents a view of Þræll in line with certain slave tropes found throughout Old Norse literature, as dark, short, stupid, gloomy and ugly. Þræll and his aged parents live as tenants in one farmhouse and he and his sons engage largely in menial labor such as keeping the household in firewood and cutting turf. Although his working status is indeterminate, the field work in particular is fairly typical of the kind of services that slaves would render to a master in the Old Norse world. Thus, the use of slave tropes and the focus on labor can be read as descriptive of the typical lifestyle of the lower class, whether slaves or simply lower-class laborers.

The middle class of freemen, who are descended from Karl, are less easy to pin down, but the scholarly consensus seems to be that Karl &quot;represents the class of free-born peasant proprietor called &#x27;bondi&#x27; or &#x27;bui&#x27;, ... a kind of hereditary aristocracy, self-governed, and absolutely independent&quot;. Specifically, Karl is described as fairly prosperous, given that he and his family are landed proprietors or freeholders who own the farm building on the land they work. Additional details reveal the relative comfort of his life: his mother, Amma&#x27;s stylish shoulder ornaments and the free distribution of gold rings to the guests at his wedding. Karl therefore represents a class who, while they are farmers, are able to maintain a comfortable life with material pleasures and luxuries.

Finally we are presented with the class of Jarl or earl, who represents &quot;the idle aristocrat ... whose sole occupations are raiding, hunting, and swimming&quot;. Born to parents who live in even more luxury than those of Karl, Jarl has bright eyes and shining hair and he lives a life of success, able to conquer and distribute his spoils to his dependents very much in the style of ancient Viking heroes.

The poem also presents Konr as representative of the special class of kings and in examining what his character represents, scholar Thomas Hill&#x27;s view was:

Although the poem is concerned with the origins of kingship, it seems to reflect a specifically aristocratic rather than royalist view, in that the king who begins to emerge in the final stanzas of the poem is not set apart by birth from the other sons of Jarl, and is in fact the youngest son.

In fact, Konr gets his power directly from Ríg, and the idea of a king is therefore of a man who is blessed by the gods, though not necessarily descended from them in the strict patrilineal fashion typical of Western monarchies.

Given the very different ways in which these three classes are represented both physically and in terms of their activities, the etiological myth of &quot;Rígsþula&quot; can be seen as implying that the three classes are essentially different species. A second interpretation, however, is that &quot;the names of the three couples - great-grandfather and great-grandmother, grandfather and grandmother, and finally father and mother - might seem to imply that the various classes of mankind share a common heritage&quot;. The poem has been viewed as suggestive of social progress over time, so that one class may aspire to move up. According to Hill, however, most agree that this second view is too benevolent and that in fact the poem reveals that for the Vikings:

The different orders of mankind are indeed fixed and unchangeable, but in the very beginning there was a certain kinship between the different orders of mankind, a kinship suggested by the fixed and yet linked sequence of the genealogical chain.

== Theories ==
A marriage by Konr the young into the family of Dan and Danþír seems to be where the tale was headed, as seen in the two other sources that mention this Rígr. According to Arngrímur Jónsson&#x27;s Latin epitome of the lost &quot;Skjöldungasaga&quot;:

Ríg (Rigus) was a man not the least among the great ones of his time. He married the daughter of a certain Danþír, lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.

The other tradition appears in chapter 20 of the &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot; section of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. The story speaks of King Dygvi of Sweden:

Dygvi&#x27;s mother was Drótt, a daughter of King Danþír, the son of Ríg, who was first called &quot;konungr&quot; in the Danish tongue. His descendants always afterwards considered the title of &quot;konungr&quot; the title of highest dignity. Dygvi was the first of his family to be called &quot;konungr&quot;, for his predecessors had been called &quot;dróttinn&quot; [chieftain], and their wives &quot;dróttning&quot;, and their court &quot;drótt&quot; (war band). Each of their race was called Yngvi, or Ynguni, and the whole race together Ynglingar. Queen Drótt was a sister of King Dan Mikillati, from whom Denmark took its name.

Despite genealogical discrepancies (to be evaded only by imagining more than one &quot;Danþír&quot; and more than one &quot;Dan&quot;) the accounts relate a common tradition about the origin of the title &quot;konungr&quot; (king).

Konr the young, whose magical abilities are so emphasized, is as much a magician as a warrior: a magician king, perhaps a sacred king. Dumézil pointed out that Kon alone represents the supernatural function, represented by the Brahmin caste in India, the flamen function in Rome, the druids in some Celtic cultures, and the clergy in the three estates of medieval Europe. Instead of the three estates of clergy/priest, warrior, and commoner, with serfs outside the system, the &quot;Rígsþula&quot; presents three estates or castes in which the clergy/priest class has been subsumed within the warrior class and identified with royalty. Also, although in Rome and India the color white is assigned to the sacred and to priests and red to warriors, here the noble warrior is white in color while the red coloration is ascribed instead to the commoner in place of the green, blue, or yellow color assigned to the lower classes in other cultures associated with Proto-Indo-European society. Dumézil saw this as a Germanic adaptation of the Indo-European heritage.

Jean Young and Ursula Dronke, among others, have suggested that the &quot;Rígsþula&quot; story is Celtic in origin and that the name Rígr is an indication of this.

<text>Interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) or aesthetic selection is a general term for methods of evolutionary computation that use human evaluation. Usually human evaluation is necessary when the form of fitness function is not known (for example, visual appeal or attractiveness; as in Dawkins, 1986) or the result of optimization should fit a particular user preference (for example, taste of coffee or color set of the user interface).

==IEC design issues==

The number of evaluations that IEC can receive from one human user is limited by user fatigue which was reported by many researchers as a major problem. In addition, human evaluations are slow and expensive as compared to fitness function computation. Hence, one-user IEC methods should be designed to converge using a small number of evaluations, which necessarily implies very small populations. Several methods were proposed by researchers to speed up convergence, like interactive constrain evolutionary search (user intervention) or fitting user preferences using a convex function. IEC human–computer interfaces should be carefully designed in order to reduce user fatigue. There is also evidence that the addition of computational agents can successfully counteract user fatigue.

However IEC implementations that can concurrently accept evaluations from many users overcome the limitations described above. An example of this approach is an interactive media installation by Karl Sims that allows one to accept preferences from many visitors by using floor sensors to evolve attractive 3D animated forms. Some of these multi-user IEC implementations serve as collaboration tools, for example HBGA.

==IEC types==

IEC methods include interactive evolution strategy, interactive genetic algorithm, interactive genetic programming, and human-based genetic algorithm.,

===IGA===

An interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) is defined as a genetic algorithm that uses human evaluation. These algorithms belong to a more general category of Interactive evolutionary computation. The main application of these techniques include domains where it is hard or impossible to design a computational fitness function, for example, evolving images, music, various artistic designs and forms to fit a user&#x27;s aesthetic preferences. Interactive computation methods can use different representations, both linear (as in traditional genetic algorithms) and tree-like ones (as in genetic programming).

<doc id="901165" wikidata="Q626721" url="?curid=901165" title="Kalibo">
<text>Kalibo, officially the Municipality of Kalibo (Aklanon: &quot;Banwa it Kalibo&quot;; Hiligaynon: &quot;Banwa sang Kalibo&quot;; ), is a municipality and capital of the Province of Aklan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 89,127 people.

Kalibo is located in the north-west of Panay island and also, it is the most populous town in Aklan. It is the main transportation hub for the resort island of Boracay. The municipality is known for the Ati-Atihan festival; the semi-urban and multi-awarded mangrove forest Bakhawan Eco-Park and piña-weaving, which was inscribed to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2023.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Kalibo&quot; comes from the Aklanon word &quot;sangkâ líbo&quot;, (&quot;one thousand&quot;), reputedly the number of native Ati who attended the first Catholic Mass celebrated there. Kalibo was originally spelled as &quot;Calivo&quot;.

The town of Kalibo was originally called &quot;Akean&quot; by the inhabitants, similar to the name of the river nearby. The word &quot;akean&quot; itself connotes the warbling of running waters, from the root word &quot;akae&quot;, meaning &quot;to boil&quot;. &quot;Akae-akae&quot; means &quot;to bubble&quot; or &quot;to boil&quot; or &quot;to make the sound of bubbling or boiling&quot; in the Aklanon language.

The Spaniards interchanged the names Aklan and Calivo to refer to the town. Aside from these two, other names such as Calibo, Daclan, Adan, and Calibog have been used.

==History==
===Precolonial and Spanish Colonial Period===

When Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in 1569, he discovered that the town already had around 2,000 inhabitants, so he recruited 500 of them to help conquer the rest of the Philippines. On November 3, 1571, it became an &quot;encomienda&quot; and on April 22, 1581, the town became a parish under the Augustinians. During the Spanish era, Kalibo was part of Capiz.

On March 17, 1897, Filipino revolutionaries march to Kalibo but lost the battle against the Spaniards. Some of them escaped to the jungle.

On March 23, 1897, the Nineteen Martyrs of Aklan were executed by the Spanish colonial government for their role in the Philippine Revolution.

===Commonwealth, World War II and Post-war Period===

Aklan continued to be part of Capiz during the early 20th century. When the Americans came, they annexed financially-struggling towns with bigger towns in the whole country, reducing the number of municipalities in Capiz from 34 to 24. In 1903, today&#x27;s towns of Lezo, Numancia, and Banga were annexed to Kalibo. Lezo and Numancia (which were a single municipality then) de-merged in 1909 and Banga followed suit in 1912.


In 1929, the Capiz Provincial Hospital was built in Kalibo. Equipped with 30 beds, it was one of the few provincial capitals located outside provincial capitals. It opened in 1930. However, the war forced it to close, only reopening in 1945. In 1981, the hospital would later be renamed Dr. Rafael S. Tumbukon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH), in honor of Dr. Rafael Tumbokon, a former representative of the 3rd district of Capiz (1932 to 1938) and Undersecretary of Health in the 1950s.

The town also suffered from World War II. Kalibo itself was occupied by the Japanese from May to August 1942, and then the invaders moved on to Capiz. They returned to town 15 months later, following the October 1943 &quot;juez de cuchillo&quot; where the Japanese massacred 74 Batan residents. This time, they garrisoned the towns of Kalibo, Ibajay, New Washington, Altavas, Balete, and Batan. The town would eventually be liberated together with the entire island of Panay on March 18, 1945.

The town&#x27;s older private colleges were established after the war: Aklan Catholic College (1945), and Northwestern Visayan Colleges (1948).

On November 8, 1956, the province of Aklan was officially established, and Kalibo became its capital.

The town&#x27;s trade school, the Roxas Memorial School of Arts and Trades (RMSAT), was established in 1959 and opened in 1960.

===Martial Law Period (1965-1986)===

The mid-60s to mid-80s saw several developments rise in Kalibo as it took on its role as Aklan&#x27;s capital town. The Garcia College of Technology, a private technical college, opened in 1968. St Gabriel Medical Center, a major private hospital, opened its doors in 1969.
The local power company, Aklan Electric Cooperative, was established in 1972. Meanwhile, the local water district, the Metro Kalibo Water District, was created in 1976. The provincial diocese was also erected in 1976.

RMSAT was elevated to a state college in 1983.

In 1984, Typhoon Agnes (local name &quot;Undang&quot;), ravaged Kalibo and the whole province. It would become the worst typhoon disaster Kalibo will experience until Typhoon Fengshen (local name &quot;Frank&quot;) in 2008.

===Contemporary Period (1986-present)===

As a response to &quot;Undang&quot;, the Bakhawan Eco-Park began to take shape in December 1989 when the Kalibo Save the Mangroves movement was organized.

RMCAT became part of Aklan State College of Agriculture in 1998. It was elevated into a university in 2001.

In 1990, the town recorded 50,000 residents for the first time. Kalibo was classified a first-class municipality in 1997, and again in 2008. The town&#x27;s first major mall, Gaisano Capital Kalibo, opened in 2002. It is located in Roxas Avenue Extension, and had 20,000 sqm of retail space.

==Geography==

Kalibo is located at .

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the municipality has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aklan.

===Topography===

Kalibo is situated on the alluvial plains of the Aklan River which lies to its west. The town is generally flat, with slopes ranging from 0 to 3%.

===Climate===
===Barangays===
Kalibo is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

All barangays are classified as urban. Mobo was formerly known as &quot;Tinigao Bongoe&quot;.






==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, Kalibo had a population of 89,127. The population density was .

===Language===
Aklanon is the main dialect of Kalibo and the entire province of Aklan. Hiligaynon is also spoken as the secondary language of the municipality.

==Economy==
Kalibo&#x27;s main industry is agriculture, based on rice, coconuts, &quot;piña&quot; and abaca. The town also produces piña fiber, which is marketed as an alternative to traditional leather. Kalibo also has food manufacturing facilities, supporting a meat-processing industry that produces &quot;chorizo&quot;, &quot;tocino&quot; and other similar products.

Kalibo serves as the commercial center for Aklan province, owing to its status as the provincial capital. Its institutions serve its immediate surrounding area. In 2021, the municipality hosted 28 banks and held 19 million pesos in total deposits, the largest among 17 municipalities of Aklan. This is equivalent to 75% of all deposits in the province. The Kalibo Public Market, Gaisano Grand, Gaisano Capital, CityMall and SM Cherry further cement Kalibo&#x27;s position as a retail hub.

The town also hosts multiple higher educational institutions such as Aklan Catholic College, Northwestern Visayan Colleges and Garcia College of Technology. The College of Industrial Technology of Aklan State University is located in Andagao.

Some hospitals in the town include the government-owned Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital; the private St Gabriel Hospital, Panay Healthcare Medical Center and Asia Pacific Medical Center.

Tourism in Kalibo peaks during the Ati-Atihan Festival, celebrated every second week of January and culminating on the third Sunday. The town also benefits from good road connections to Boracay, allowing it to become a jump-off point for tourists headed to the island. This is all underpinned by the presence of the Kalibo International Airport which was the fourth busiest airport in the country as of 2022.

==Culture==

===Ati-Atihan Festival===

The Ati-Atihan Festival is a festival celebrated in Kalibo every second week of January and culminating on the third Sunday of the month. Revelers smear themselves with soot or any blackening substance in order to look like an Ati.

The Ati-Atihan Festival is believed to have started in the year 1212 when Borneans, led by the ten datus, traveled on balangays and crossed the Sulu Sea to land in Panay, making it the oldest festival in the Philippines.

Ati-atihan Festival was included as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Festivals&quot; by Fest300, dubbed as the &quot;Grand Daddy of Philippine Festivals&quot; by the Largest Travel Guide Book Publisher in the World - Lonely Planet and recognized, as well as, holds the title of &quot;Mother of All Philippine Festivals&quot;.

===Attractions===
Landmarks of the town include Aklan River, the main river that flows through the town and the origin of the name of the province. Within the town proper lies Freedom Shrine which commemorates World War II veterans and the &quot;Museo it Akean&quot;, a museum of Aklan&#x27;s history. Outside the town lies Bakhawan Eco-Park, a mangrove reforestation project that began in 1990 in barangay New Buswang. Tigayon Hill and Caves in Barangay Tigayon which were burial sites during the pre-Hispanic era and a pit for Chinese artifacts which were excavated in the recent past.

===Historical Markers===
The table below is the list of Historical Markers installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in Kalibo.
==Infrastructure==

Kalibo&#x27;s roads are composed of national, municipal and barangay roads. The town is connected to Iloilo City and Roxas City via the Aklan East Coast Road. In 2023, the new Kalibo Circumferential Road was declared as a national-level road. The road features a new bridge (Kalibo Bridge III) across the Aklan River and connects municipalities west of it to Brgy. Tigayon, the airport, and the jetty port in Brgy. Pook.

Water is provided by the Metro Kalibo Water District while power is provided by the Aklan Electric Cooperative.

<text>Benjamin Zander (born 9 March 1939 in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, England) is an English conductor, who is currently the musical director of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra and the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra.

==Biography==

Benjamin Zander was born in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, England. His parents, Walter and Margarete (Gretl) Zander, had emigrated from Berlin in 1937 to escape the Nazis, and raised their four children: Michael, Luke, Angelica, and Benjamin.
At home, his father would regularly sing and play piano after work. Benjamin Zander is Jewish.

Benjamin Zander started to compose music at the age of nine. Several of his compositions came to the attention of composer Benjamin Britten, who invited the Zander family to spend three summers in Aldeburgh, England, the seaside town in Suffolk where he lived.
Benjamin Zander took lessons with Benjamin Britten and became a student of theory of Britten&#x27;s amanuensis and assistant, Imogen Holst.

===Early life===
Zander&#x27;s main instrument was the cello. He began studying at the age of 10 and became the youngest member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain at the age of 12. He went as a boarder at Uppingham School, as a music scholar at the age of 13 and thence attended St Paul&#x27;s School, London so he could continue his cello studies with Herbert Withers.

At the age of 15, Zander became a student of the Spanish cello virtuoso Gaspar Cassadó and moved to Florence and Siena, Italy for the next three years. He completed his cello studies at the State Conservatoire in Cologne, Germany where he served as an assistant to Cassadó.

After living abroad for five years, Zander returned to England, completed his A levels and studied at University College London for a degree in English Literature, winning the University-wide English Literature Essay Prize.
During his period of study at University, he performed regularly as a cellist, giving recitals and chamber music concerts with the King-Zander-Arieli Trio and taught at the Yehudi Menuhin School for gifted children.

In 1965, he won a Harkness International Fellowship and travelled to the United States for graduate work at Brandeis University, Harvard University and with Leonard Shure and Ernst Oster in New York.

===New England Conservatory===
In 1967, Zander joined the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music and remained on the faculty until 2012. In July 2012, the New England Conservatory and Preparatory School conferred on him the title of Faculty Emeritus, acknowledging his significant contributions to the school over 45 years.

This followed his dismissal in January 2012 for negligence amid allegations he had hired a videographer to record concerts, who had (to Zander&#x27;s knowledge) previously served a prison sentence for sexual assault of a minor. Zander later acknowledged that hiring the videographer, Peter Benjamin, without informing school administrators was a &quot;significant oversight&quot;.

===Boston Philharmonic===
Benjamin Zander is the Conductor and Music Director of the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, a youth orchestra in Boston comprising both high school and college age students. The BPYO rehearses at various venues across Boston, some of which include -Hibernian Hall, The Holy Trinity Armenian Apostle Church and Symphony Hall. Their premiere performance took place in Symphony Hall on 25 November 2012. On the program was Strauss&#x27; Ein Heldenleben, Beethoven&#x27;s Egmont Overture, and Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto with Alisa Weilerstein as soloist.
BPYO&#x27;s first international tour took place the summer of 2013 as the entire orchestra visited The Netherlands to play Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony in the Concertgebouw. In 2024 they toured Europe with a program of the Schumann Cello Concerto No. 1 (with Zlatomir Fung), and Mahler’s Fifth Symphony. They visited Basel, Prague, Hamburg, Vienna and Berlin, performing in halls such as Die Musikverein and Die Berliner Philharmonie.

==Personal life==

Benjamin and Patricia Zander were married in 1966. They have one child, a daughter, Jessica. Jessica and her husband David Tomaszewski have two daughters, M. and Vivian.

<doc id="901171" wikidata="Q422772" url="?curid=901171" title="Nitro compound">
<text>In organic chemistry, nitro compounds are organic compounds that contain one or more nitro functional groups (). The nitro group is one of the most common explosophores (functional group that makes a compound explosive) used globally. The nitro group is also strongly electron-withdrawing. Because of this property, bonds alpha (adjacent) to the nitro group can be acidic. For similar reasons, the presence of nitro groups in aromatic compounds retards electrophilic aromatic substitution but facilitates nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Nitro groups are rarely found in nature. They are almost invariably produced by nitration reactions starting with nitric acid.

==Synthesis==
===Preparation of aromatic nitro compounds ===
Aromatic nitro compounds are typically synthesized by nitration. Nitration is achieved using a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, which produce the nitronium ion (), which is the electrophile: 

The nitration product produced on the largest scale, by far, is nitrobenzene. Many explosives are produced by nitration including trinitrophenol (picric acid), trinitrotoluene (TNT), and trinitroresorcinol (styphnic acid).
Another but more specialized method for making aryl–NO2 group starts from halogenated phenols, is the Zinke nitration.

===Preparation of aliphatic nitro compounds ===
Aliphatic nitro compounds can be synthesized by various methods; notable examples include:
*Free radical nitration of alkanes. The reaction produces fragments from the parent alkane, creating a diverse mixture of products; for instance, nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane are produced by treating propane with nitric acid in the gas phase (e.g. 350–450 °C and 8–12 atm).
*Nucleophilic substitution reactions between halocarbons or organosulfates with silver or alkali nitrite salts.
*Nitromethane can be produced in the laboratory by treating sodium chloroacetate with sodium nitrite.
*Oxidation of oximes or primary amines.
*Reduction of β-nitro alcohols or nitroalkenes.
*By decarboxylation of α-nitro carboxylic acids formed from nitriles and ethyl nitrate.

====Ter Meer Reaction====
In nucleophilic aliphatic substitution, sodium nitrite (NaNO2) replaces an alkyl halide. In the so-called Ter Meer reaction (1876) named after Edmund ter Meer, the reactant is a 1,1-halonitroalkane:

The reaction mechanism is proposed in which in the first slow step a proton is abstracted from nitroalkane 1 to a carbanion 2 followed by protonation to an aci-nitro 3 and finally nucleophilic displacement of chlorine based on an experimentally observed hydrogen kinetic isotope effect of 3.3. When the same reactant is reacted with potassium hydroxide the reaction product is the 1,2-dinitro dimer.

==Occurrence==
=== In nature ===
Chloramphenicol is a rare example of a naturally occurring nitro compound. At least some naturally occurring nitro groups arose by the oxidation of amino groups. 2-Nitrophenol is an aggregation pheromone of ticks.

Examples of nitro compounds are rare in nature. 3-Nitropropionic acid found in fungi and plants (&quot;Indigofera&quot;). Nitropentadecene is a defense compound found in termites. Aristolochic acids are found in the flowering plant family Aristolochiaceae. Nitrophenylethane is found in &quot;Aniba canelilla&quot;. Nitrophenylethane is also found in members of the Annonaceae, Lauraceae and Papaveraceae.

=== In pharmaceuticals ===
Despite the occasional use in pharmaceuticals, the nitro group is associated with mutagenicity and genotoxicity and therefore is often regarded as a liability in the drug discovery process.

== Reactions==
Nitro compounds participate in several organic reactions, the most important being reduction of nitro compounds to the corresponding amines:
:RNO2 + 3 H2 → RNH2 + 2 H2O
Virtually all aromatic amines (e.g. aniline) are derived from nitroaromatics through such catalytic hydrogenation. A variation is formation of a dimethylaminoarene with palladium on carbon and formaldehyde:
The α-carbon of nitroalkanes is somewhat acidic. The p&quot;K&quot;a values of nitromethane and 2-nitropropane are respectively 17.2 and 16.9 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, suggesting an aqueous p&quot;K&quot;a of around 11. In other words, these carbon acids can be deprotonated in aqueous solution. The conjugate base is called a nitronate, and behaves similar to an enolate. In the nitroaldol reaction, it adds directly to aldehydes, and, with enones, can serve as a Michael donor. Conversely, a nitroalkene reacts with enols as a Michael acceptor. Nitrosating a nitronate gives a nitrolic acid. 

Nitronates are also key intermediates in the Nef reaction: when exposed to acids or oxidants, a nitronate hydrolyzes to a carbonyl and azanone.

Grignard reagents combine with nitro compounds to give a nitrone; but a Grignard reagent with an α hydrogen will then add again to the nitrone to give a hydroxylamine salt. 

===Dye syntheses===
The Leimgruber–Batcho, Bartoli and Baeyer–Emmerling indole syntheses begin with aromatic nitro compounds. Indigo can be synthesized in a condensation reaction from &quot;ortho&quot;-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone in strongly basic conditions in a reaction known as the Baeyer–Drewson indigo synthesis.

===Biochemical reactions===
Many flavin-dependent enzymes are capable of oxidizing aliphatic nitro compounds to less-toxic aldehydes and ketones. Nitroalkane oxidase and 3-nitropropionate oxidase oxidize aliphatic nitro compounds exclusively, whereas other enzymes such as glucose oxidase have other physiological substrates.

===Explosions===
Explosive decomposition of organo nitro compounds are redox reactions, wherein both the oxidant (nitro group) and the fuel (hydrocarbon substituent) are bound within the same molecule. The explosion process generates heat by forming highly stable products including molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide, and water. The explosive power of this redox reaction is enhanced because these stable products are gases at mild temperatures. Many contact explosives contain the nitro group.

<text>A zone plate is a device used to focus light or other things exhibiting wave character. Unlike lenses or curved mirrors, zone plates use diffraction instead of refraction or reflection. Based on analysis by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel, they are sometimes called Fresnel zone plates in his honor. The zone plate&#x27;s focusing ability is an extension of the Arago spot phenomenon caused by diffraction from an opaque disc.

A zone plate consists of a set of concentric rings, known as Fresnel zones, which alternate between being opaque and transparent. Light hitting the zone plate will diffract around the opaque zones. The zones can be spaced so that the diffracted light constructively interferes at the desired focus, creating an image there.

==Design and manufacture==
To get constructive interference at the focus, the zones should switch from opaque to transparent at radii where
formula_1

where &quot;n&quot; is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the light the zone plate is meant to focus and &quot;f&quot; is the distance from the center of the zone plate to the focus. When the zone plate is small compared to the focal length, this can be approximated as
formula_2

For plates with many zones, you can calculate the distance to the focus if you only know the radius of the outermost zone, &quot;r&quot;&quot;N&quot;, and its width, Δ&quot;r&quot;&quot;N&quot;:
formula_3

In the long focal length limit, the area of each zone is equal, because the width of the zones must decrease farther from the center. The maximum possible resolution of a zone plate depends on the smallest zone width, 
formula_4

Because of this, the smallest size object you can image, Δ&quot;l&quot;, is limited by how small you can reliably make your zones.

Zone plates are frequently manufactured using lithography. As lithography technology improves and the size of features that can be manufactured decreases, the possible resolution of zone plates manufactured with this technique can improve.

=== Continuous zone plates ===
Unlike a standard lens, a binary zone plate produces intensity maxima along the axis of the plate at odd fractions (&quot;f&quot;/3, &quot;f&quot;/5, &quot;f&quot;/7, etc.). Although these contain less energy (counts of the spot) than the principal focus (because it is wider), they have the same maximum intensity (counts/m).

However, if the zone plate is constructed so that the opacity varies in a gradual, sinusoidal manner, the resulting diffraction causes only a single focal point to be formed. This type of zone plate pattern is the equivalent of a transmission hologram of a converging lens.

For a smooth zone plate, the opacity (or transparency) at a point can be given by:
formula_5

where formula_6 is the distance from the plate center, and formula_7 determines the plate&#x27;s scale.

Binary zone plates use almost the same formula, however they depend only on the sign:
formula_8

===Free parameter===
It does not matter to the constructive interference what the absolute phase is, but only that it is the same from each ring. So an arbitrary length can be added to all the paths
formula_9

This reference phase can be chosen to optimize secondary properties such as side lobes.

==Applications==

===Physics===
There are many wavelengths of light outside of the visible area of the electromagnetic spectrum where traditional lens materials like glass are not transparent, and so lenses are more difficult to manufacture. Likewise, there are many wavelengths for which there are no materials with a refractive index significantly differing from one. X-rays, for example, are only weakly refracted by glass or other materials, and so require a different technique for focusing. Zone plates eliminate the need for finding transparent, refractive, easy-to-manufacture materials for every region of the spectrum. The same zone plate will focus light of many wavelengths to different foci, which means they can also be used to filter out unwanted wavelengths while focusing the light of interest.

Other waves such as sound waves and, due to quantum mechanics, matter waves can be focused in the same way. Wave plates have been used to focus beams of neutrons and helium atoms.

===Photography===

Zone plates are also used in photography in place of a lens or pinhole for a glowing, soft-focus image. One advantage over pinholes (aside from the unique, fuzzy look achieved with zone plates) is that the transparent area is larger than that of a comparable pinhole. The result is that the effective f-number of a zone plate is lower than for the corresponding pinhole and the exposure time can be decreased. Common f-numbers for a pinhole camera range from to or higher, whereas zone plates are frequently and lower. This makes hand held shots feasible at the higher ISO settings available with newer DSLR cameras.

===Gunsights===
Zone plates have been proposed as a cheap alternative to more expensive optical sights or targeting lasers.

===Lenses===
Zone plates may be used as imaging lenses with a single focus as long as the type of grating used is sinusoidal in nature. A specifically designed Fresnel zone plate with blazed phase structures is sometimes called a kinoform.

===Reflection===
A zone plate used as a reflector will allow radio waves to be focused as if by a parabolic reflector. This allows the reflector to be flat, and so easier to make. It also allows an appropriately patterned Fresnel reflector to be mounted flush to the side of a building, avoiding the wind loading that a paraboloid would be subject to.

===Software testing===
A bitmap representation of a zone plate image may be used for testing various image processing algorithms, such as:
* Image interpolation and image resampling;
* Image filtering.
An open-source zone-plate image generator is available.

After making his debut for Tamil Nadu during the 2001–02 Ranji Trophy, Balaji was selected for the Indian national cricket team in 2002. In November 2002, he made his ODI debut against West Indies in the fifth match of the series at Vadodara. He went wicket less in four overs as India lost the match by five wickets. He did not play another international match before his test debut against New Zealand in October 2003 at Ahmedabad. He took his first and only wicket in the match, which ended in a draw. In the next match of the series, he went wicket-less. In January 2004, he was part of the Indian team that played a tri-series with Australia and Zimbabwe in Australia. He played all the 10 matches and finished as the fourth highest wicket taker in the series with 13 wickets.

Following his performance in Australia, he was selected for the Indian team that toured Pakistan in March-April 2004. He played in all the three test matches and finished as the second highest wicket taker with 12 wickets, leading India to a series victory. In the subsequent ODI series, which was also won by India, Balaji took six wickets in five matches. He was part of the Indian team that finished as runners-up in the 2004 Asia Cup but took just three wickets from four matches. Balaji played two ODIs in the 2004 Videocon Cup tri-series with Australia and Pakistan, taking six wickets to finish as the leading wicket taker. He played two matches during the Indian team, taking two wickets. During the subsequent visit of Pakistan in March 2005, Balaji played all the three test matches, the final match of which was the last of his career. He took nine wickets in the first match of the series including his career best of 5/76 in the first innings. He finished as the third highest wicket taker of the series which ended in a draw. In the subsequent ODI series, he took just three wickets in four matches, which resulted in an Indian defeat. 

In 2005, Balaji suffered a stress fracture, which got exaggerated as he continued to play with injury. Subsequent injuries ruled him out of playing cricket for more than a year. Balaji made his return to cricket in 2007 and after a strong 2008-09 domestic season where helped Tamil Nadu reach the Ranji Trophy semifinals, he was called up to the Indian ODI squad in January 2009. Balaji played the final match of the series against Sri Lanka, which turned out to be final ODI match of his international career. In February, BCCI announced that Balaji had been dropped from the ODI squad for the New Zealand tour but had been selected for the test squad. But he did not play any matches in the series.

Balaji made his T20I debut against New Zealand at his home ground in Chennai on 11 September 2012. Subsequently, he was selected in the Indian squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. He played four matches in the tournament including his last international match against South Africa. He took nine wickets to finish as the fourth highest wicket taker despite playing only four matches as India crashed out of the tournament in the group stage.

==Indian Premier League==
On 29 March 2008, Balaji was signed by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to play in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League. On 10 May 2008,he picked up the tournament&#x27;s first hat-trick in the match against Kings XI Punjab in Chennai, finishing with a match-winning five-wicket haul and earning his first Man of the Match award. He played 29 matches across three seasons for CSK, taking 31 wickets. He was part of the squad that won the 2010 Indian Premier League and Champions League Twenty20. Ahead of the 2011 season, he was purchased by Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL auction. He took 33 wickets in 35 matches across three seasons. He won the 2012 Indian Premier League title with Knight Riders, defeating his former team Super Kings in the finals. In his final season of the IPL, he played for Kings XI Punjab, taking 12 wickets in nine matches.

== Coaching career ==
After his retirement from all forms of cricket in 2016, he was appointed as bowling coach and mentor by Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2017 Indian Premier League season. For the 2018 season, he was appointed as the bowling coach of Chennai Super Kings. He resigned from the post in 2022, citing personal reasons, but continued to work for the Super Kings Academy.

<text>Antofagasta () is a port city in northern Chile, about north of Santiago. It is the capital of Antofagasta Province and Antofagasta Region. According to the 2015 census, the city has a population of 402,669.

Once claimed by Bolivia following the Spanish American wars of independence, Antofagasta was captured by Chile on February 14, 1879, triggering the War of the Pacific (1879–83). Chilean sovereignty was officially recognised by Bolivia under the terms of the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.

The city of Antofagasta is closely linked to mining activity, being a port and the chief service hub for one of Chile&#x27;s major mining areas. While silver and saltpeter mining have been historically important for Antofagasta, since the mid-19th century copper mining is by far the most important mining activity for Antofagasta, fueling a steady growth in the areas of construction, retail, hotel accommodations, population growth and skyline development until the end of the 2000s commodities boom in 2013. 

Since the 2010s Antofagasta is also a service hub for lithium mining.

In 2012, Antofagasta has the highest GDP per capita of Chile, US$37,000 and the 3rd place for Human Development Index just after Metropolitana de Santiago Region and Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region.

== History ==
=== Early settlers ===
The territory of Antofagasta was included in maps of the Captaincy General of Chile in the 18th century, depending from the city of Copiapó.

The territory was disputed between Chile and Bolivia until the signing of the Boundary Treaty of 1866.

On 18 September 1866, José Santos Ossa and Francisco Puelma achieved the award of the concession of nitrate lands, following a request taken to the Bolivian government. The exploring of the Chilean miners found rich deposits of saltpeter (nitratine) in the field of Salar del Carmen, to the east of the present Antofagasta. Agreed to form the &quot;&quot;Sociedad Exploradora del Desierto de Atacama&quot; (Explorer Society of Atacama Desert). After the formation of the company, began to fill with what was called &quot;La Chimba&quot;&quot;. 

On 8 May 1872, Antofagasta was designated by the Bolivian Government as &quot;Puerto Mayor&quot;, opening trade worldwide. Next year, on 25 January 1872, following a session led by the prefect of the Provincial Department of Mejillones, Manuel Buitrago founded the Municipality of Antofagasta under Bolivian Law of Municipalities, which formed the body of &quot;Municipal Agents&quot;, composed of two Germans, one Englishman and six Chileans.

On 27 November 1873, the &quot;Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta&quot; (CSFA), a Chilean mining company, signed a contract with the government of Bolivia, in which taxes were removed from mineral exploitation for 15 years. This contract was not ratified by the Congress of Bolivia, which was then analyzed negotiations with Chile.

=== War of the Pacific ===

In 1873, Bolivia signed a secret treaty of defensive alliance with Peru. This would be used as an argument 5 years later in Chile, when it unleashed the War of the Pacific. The secret alliance forbade Bolivia from signing a border treaty with Chile, without consulting with Peru. However, in 1874 Chile and Bolivia signed a border treaty, which replaced the previous treaty of 1866. One of its points was not to impose new taxes on individuals, industries and Chilean capital for 25 years.

For Bolivia, the contract of 1873 between the government and CSFA was not yet in force, because, according to the Bolivian constitution, all contracts with the Bolivian government had to be approved by the congress.

According to the Bolivian version of events, the contract with the saltpeter company was incomplete so the congress, to approve the contract, decided to enforce a tax of 10 cents, which did not violate the treaty of 1874, since the contract was not yet in force at that date. Bolivia suspended the tax in deference to the government of Chile, but following a note from the Chilean foreign minister, it reactivated the tax law, then cancelled and closed the &quot;Compañía de Salitres&quot;. Faced with a looming conflict with Chile, Bolivia decided to claim support under the agreement signed with Peru, and the treaty became effective with the Chilean occupation of Antofagasta, on 14 February 1879.

According to the Chilean version of events, the tax of 10 cents violated the treaty of 1874 since according to this, new taxes should not have been imposed on Chilean companies operating in Bolivia. At the breaking of the boundary treaty by Bolivia, and the cancellation of the contract of the CSFA, Chile seized Antofagasta, then in Bolivian territory, whose sovereignty had been ratified before 1866. After the war, a pact of truce was signed between Bolivia and Chile in 1884, which stated that the territory between the Loa River and parallel 23 would be under the administration of Chile, while Bolivia would be allowed access to the ports of Arica and Antofagasta.

=== 20th century ===

The &quot;Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Bolivia&quot;, signed on 20 October 1904, and promulgated on 21 March 1905, established in perpetuity border between Chile and Bolivia.

In 1912, the British community (&quot;La Colonia Britanica&quot;) erected a clock tower, replicating Big Ben, in Plaza Colón to celebrate the republic&#x27;s centenary.

In 1956, the Universidad del Norte (now the Catholic University of the North) was founded, due to support from the Catholic University of Valparaíso. On 9 October, of the same year began the negotiations for the creation of the &quot;Centro Universitario Zona Norte&quot; (University Center North Zone), part of the University of Chile.

On 18 June 1991, a mudslide devastated much of the city, undermining land, damaged 2,464 houses and destroyed 493 buildings. Material damage was estimated at $70,000,000. The disaster left 92 dead, 16 missing and about 20,000 homeless. On 30 July 1995, the city was hit by an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale, with an intensity VII to VIII on the Mercalli Scale.

=== 2000–present===


The city was awarded the installation of the &quot;Casino Enjoy Antofagasta&quot;.

In the municipal elections of 2008, the first female mayor of the city, Dra. Marcela Hernando, was elected, who retired from her political party to run as an independent. This allowed her to have diverse support from all sectors of the population of Antofagasta.

== Geography ==

The city has an average elevation of . 

The urban area of Antofagasta begins abruptly, breaking the monotony of the desert and is located in the coastal plains, south of Mejillones Peninsula and north of &quot;Cerro Coloso&quot;. The Tropic of Capricorn passes in the north of the city, outside the urban area, which is located the Cerro Moreno International Airport. The Tropic of Capricorn Monument was opened on 21 December 2000 in celebration of this. Designed by the architect Eleonora Roman, it was created to point the Tropic of Capricorn and to work as a Solar Calendar.

Antofagasta was declared a partial common in the border area 20 July 1999, by Supreme Decree No. 1166 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The city has little vegetation because it is situated in the Atacama Desert, which is the world&#x27;s driest nonpolar desert. However, among the vegetated areas are a series of urban wetlands. Native reptiles, arthropods, birds like the &quot;Calidris&quot; and mammals like the culpeo fox, inhabit or visit the wetlands. Some of these wetlands are threatened by garbage, street dogs, extraction of water, establishments of shacks () and the diversion of water courses. As of January 2024 the municipality of Antofagasta plans to declare the wetlands official urban wetlands in accordance with the Urban Wetlands Law. 

=== Climate ===

The town of Antofagasta has a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;) with abundant sunshine and strong maritime influence.

The marked aridity and water scarcity are regulated by the Humboldt Current, in addition to the high humidity and morning fog known as &quot;Camanchaca&quot;.

Furthermore, the Pacific anticyclone generates winds from the south and southwest.

The average annual temperature is . The average daily low temperature in the warmest month, January, is while the average daily high temperature is . The coldest month, July, sees an average low temperature of and an average high temperature of . The highest temperature recorded is in January 1998 and the lowest recorded is in September 1978.

The Atacama Desert coast is subject to a climate of extreme aridity, and therefore generates a low average annual rainfall of (1970–2000), and the Town of Antofagasta itself receives an annual average of less than of rainfall per year, earning it the record as the world&#x27;s driest town. However, the sporadic occurrence of heavy rainfall, together with the geomorphologic situation of the city, make it susceptible to be affected by mud flows and landslides. Between 1916 and 1999, the city was affected by floods or landslides on seven occasions: 1925, 1930, twice in 1940, 1982, 1987 and 1991, of which the most important episodes in 1940 and 1991.


=== Hydrology ===
There are about fifteen streams that have watersheds with accumulation of sand and gravel. Within the broader watershed (&quot;hoya&quot;) are the &quot;Hoya La Chimba&quot;, &quot;Hoya Caracoles&quot;, &quot;Hoya La Cadena&quot;, &quot;Hoya La Negra&quot; and &quot;Hoya El Way&quot;. These watersheds and their streams (&quot;Quebrada&quot;), such as &quot;Quebrada sin nombre&quot;, &quot;Quebrada Baquedano&quot;, &quot;Quebrada El Toro&quot;, &quot;Quebrada El Carrizo&quot; and &quot;Quebrada Jardines del Sur&quot;, which helped cause the flood of 1991. 

The coastal edge of Antofagasta is rocky and steep, so there are no natural beaches, the majority being artificial. Just north of the city, natural beaches extend to the areas of &quot;La Portada&quot;, &quot;Las Losetas&quot; and &quot;La Rinconada&quot;.

Within the water resources of the commune, there are different dry lakes (salar), among which include the Salar de Pajonales, Salar Mar Muerto, Salar Punta Negra and the Salar de Navidad.

== Governance ==

As a commune, Antofagasta is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. As of 2021, the mayor is Jonathan Velásquez. The communal council has the following members:

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Antofagasta is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Marcela Hernando (PRSD) and Paulina Nuñez (RN) as part of the 4th electoral district, together with Mejillones, Sierra Gorda and Taltal. The commune is represented in the Senate by Pedro Araya (Progressive Convergence, 2014–2022) and Alejandro Guillier (Progressive Convergence, 2014–2022) as part of the 2nd senatorial constituency (Antofagasta Region).

The township has three local police courts. In addition, the Municipality of Antofagasta has a number of municipal headquarters, which are entities created to meet and control certain community needs a more specific way.

== Economy ==
Antofagasta&#x27;s economic development is mainly based on copper mining and nonmetallic minerals such as nitrate and iodine.

There are refinery furnaces for the copper industry. Cement and lime are mined to aid copper refining. The area also has iron ore deposits, for steel. 

The second industrial area is located in the north of the city, where they have installed multiple operating centers of different companies, mainly along the &quot;Pedro Aguirre Cerda Avenue.&quot;

Since the 2010s, Antofagasta is a hub for lithium mining. Chile has the largest reserves of lithium worldwide and was the second largest producer in 2024, after Australia, and it is shipped from Antofagasta.

Trade is concentrated mainly in the center of Antofagasta, around the &quot;Plaza Colón&quot;, where within the last 2 decades several national retail chains were in place. Moreover, in different parts of the city large supermarket chains like &quot;Líder&quot;, &quot;Tottus&quot;, &quot;Unimarc&quot;, &quot;Santa Isabel&quot; and &quot;Jumbo&quot; are set up.

In 2006, the national chain &quot;Mall Plaza&quot; was built in the coastal area and the &quot;Casino Enjoy Antofagasta&quot; was built in the south of the city.

=== Business tourism ===

Because of the important administrative position of Antofagasta in the region, the historical relationship with the mining sector, and the production of the 54% of copper at the national level, business events are held in Antofagasta. 

Events are held annually with the assistance of several mining countries of the world, and one of the most important is Exponor organized by the Asociación de Industriales Antofagasta, guild formed by the major copper producers in the region. Exponor is a show that promotes the gestation of chains, new business and exchanging knowledge and experiences among entrepreneurs from different countries of the world. This important trade fair generated a portfolio of U.S. $41,291 million (63.48% world total), for the period 2007–2015.

=== Cost of living ===
In 2024, Antofagasta is the fifth most expensive city in Chile as to cost of living. Santiago, Punta Arenas, Puerto Varas and San Antonio have a higher cost of living.

== Transportation ==

=== Roads ===
The main land route connectivity in the province is Route 5-CH, which connects the city with the rest of the country and is part of the Panamerican Highway. This route connects to the city by Route CH-26 in the north of the city, and Route CH-28 to the south. In addition, the city is connected to the north of the country by Route 1-CH, a way that also allows access to Andrés Sabella Gálvez International Airport and the natural monument La Portada.

Vehicular traffic is concentrated around the main avenues of the city due to the long and narrow shape of the urban area. The only avenue that crosses the city from north to south, corresponds to the coastal route known as Avenida Costanera, which is formed by the avenues Jaime Guzmán, Ejército, República de Croacia, Grecia, José Manuel Balmaceda, Aníbal Pinto, 7º de Línea and Edmundo Pérez Zujovic; these avenues provide access to places including Mall Plaza Antofagasta, the Campus Coloso of the University of Antofagasta, the city hall of the Municipality of Antofagasta.

=== Airport ===
Andrés Sabella Gálvez International Airport is the only airport in Antofagasta and is located in &quot;Cerro Moreno&quot;, north of the city. This site, despite being classified as International Airport, operates mostly as a terminal for national flights, with one international airline, LATAM Peru, flying to Lima. In this terminal three domestic airlines also operate, LATAM Chile, JetSMART and Sky Airlines.

===Port===

The city has a port complex of seven docks, inaugurated by President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo on 14 February 1943 under the name of Puerto de Antofagasta, which consists of two terminals. Terminal 1, consists of the docks 1, 2 and 3, is multi-operator and is managed by the &quot;&quot;Empresa Portuaria Antofagasta&quot; (EPA) since 1 July 1998. Terminal No. 2, composed of docks 4, 5, 6 and 7, monooperario type, which is managed and operated by the company &quot;Antofagasta Terminal Internacional&quot;&quot; (ATI) since 1 March 2003. Overall, this tourist (member of the Association of Cruise Ports Southern Cone) and commercial port, can operate the production of 5,000,000 tons of cargo.

Escondida, the biggest private mining company in Chile, has a private port located in southern city, near Cerro Coloso.

=== Public transport ===
The higher transportation consists of thirteen lines of minibuses, which correspond to buses with a capacity of fewer than thirty people. The public transport is within a tender and is known as TransAntofagasta. The public transport plan took effect officially on 28 November 2005, replacing the old bus service. The route of these buses finish in the Caleta Coloso (south end of the city) during the year, and during the summer come as far as Balneario Juan Lopez, which is out of town.

The lower transport consists of taxis lines, corresponding to a black sedans that make their way through the urban area through fixed routes.

=== Railways ===
The most important railroad is the Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia (FCAB) founded in 1888, during the economic boom of the saltpeter industry. In 1930, FCAB was acquired by Antofagasta PLC, which is part of the Quiñenco commercial group.

Unlike other contemporary mining railways, FCAB survived the crash of the natural nitrate sector. It provides a variety of transportation services - most notably, the transport of mining products and consumables such as copper cathodes and sulfuric acid - via a long rail network that is connected to the Ferrocarril Andino de Bolivia, Ferronor (Chile), and Ferrocarril Belgrano in Argentina (Salta–Antofagasta railway). Its gauge is .

=== Future commuter rail ===

Due to the accelerated urban and demographic growth of Antofagasta during 2000–2010, a commuter train using the current FCAB line is currently under review. The project aims to decongest vehicle traffic by linking the north and south of the city with a direct train line.

<text>George Douglas Sanders (July 24, 1933 – April 12, 2020) was an American professional golfer who won 20 events on the PGA Tour and had four runner-up finishes at major championships.

==Early years==
He was born into a poor family in Cedartown, Georgia, northwest of Atlanta, where his father farmed and drove trucks. Sanders was the fourth of five children and picked cotton as a teenager. The family home was near a nine-hole course and he was a self-taught golfer.

==Amateur career==
Sanders accepted an athletic scholarship to the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he played for the Gators golf team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition in 1955. In his single year as a Gator golfer, Sanders and the team won a Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship and earned a sixth-place finish at the NCAA championship tournament—the Gators&#x27; best national championship finish at that time. Sanders won the 1956 Canadian Open as an amateur—the only amateur ever to do so—and turned professional shortly thereafter. Sanders was the last amateur to win on the PGA Tour until Scott Verplank in 1985.

==Professional career==
Sanders had thirteen top-ten finishes in major championships, including four second-place finishes: 1959 PGA Championship, 1961 U.S. Open, 1966 and 1970 Opens. In 1966, he became one of the few players in history to finish in the top ten of all four major championships in a single season, despite winning none of them. He took four shots from just 74 yards as the leader playing the final hole of the 1970 Open Championship at St Andrews, missing a sidehill putt to win, then lost the resulting 18-hole playoff by a single stroke the next day to Jack Nicklaus. His final victory on tour came in June 1972 at the Kemper Open, one stroke ahead of runner-up Lee Trevino.

Sanders is remembered for an exceptionally short, flat golf swing — a consequence, it appears, of a painful neck condition that radically restricted his movements.

He was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team in 1967, which won in Houston.

==Personal life==
Sanders was a stylish, flamboyant dresser on the golf course, which earned him the nickname &quot;Peacock of the Fairways.&quot; &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine named Sanders one of America&#x27;s Ten Best Dressed Jocks in August 1972.

Sanders identified himself as the lead character, a playboy PGA Tour golfer, in the golf novel &quot;Dead Solid Perfect&quot;, by Dan Jenkins.

Sanders wrote a golf instruction book, &quot;Compact Golf&quot;, published in 1964, the title of which linked to Sanders&#x27; short golf swing. His autobiography &quot;Come swing with me&quot; was published in 1974.

In his autobiography, Sanders said he was invited and intended to accompany fellow pro golfer and 1964 Open winner Tony Lema on the flight in a private plane in 1966 that crashed with no survivors. Sanders changed his schedule at the last minute and did not join Lema on the flight.

After retiring from competitive golf, Sanders was active in his own corporate golf entertainment company for nearly 20 years, and sponsored the Doug Sanders International Junior Golf Championship in Houston, Texas. From 1988 to 1994, he also sponsored the Doug Sanders Celebrity Classic.

Sanders died in his adopted hometown of Houston, Texas, on April 12, 2020, from natural causes. He was 86.

==Honors==
Sanders was a member of the Florida Sports Hall of Fame, Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, and the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great.&quot;

<text>Peter Löwenbräu Griffin Sr. (born Justin Peter Griffin) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;. He is voiced by the series&#x27; creator, Seth MacFarlane, and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the episode &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot; on January 31, 1999. Peter was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company based on &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, a short made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. For the series, Larry was renamed Peter.

Peter is married to Lois and is the father of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He also has a dog named Brian, with whom he is best friends with. He has worked at a toy factory and at Quahog&#x27;s Brewery. Peter&#x27;s voice was inspired by the security guards that MacFarlane heard at his school. His appearance was a redesign of the protagonist Larry from MacFarlane&#x27;s previous animated short films &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;. He has appeared in several pieces of &quot;Family Guy&quot; merchandise—including toys, T-shirts, and video games—and he has made crossover appearances in other shows, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Drawn Together&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;, in addition to fellow MacFarlane-associated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Bordertown&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; spin-off &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;.

== Role in &quot;Family Guy&quot; ==
Peter Griffin is a middle-class Irish American in his midforties, who is a bespectacled, obese blue-collar worker with a prominent Rhode Island and Eastern Massachusetts accent. Peter&#x27;s age has never been officially confirmed and has fluctuated throughout the series, although he is consistently referred to as being in his early-to-mid 40s. Peter and his wife, Lois, have three children: Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He also has two deceased children: Peter Jr., who was shaken to death, and Dave, Stewie&#x27;s twin who is implied to have been killed by Stewie during childbirth. He is the illegitimate son of Thelma Griffin and Mickey McFinnigan, and was raised by Thelma and his stepfather, Francis Griffin. It is uncertain whether Peter&#x27;s legal parents were married before he was conceived, however, as Peter has a flashback in which Francis directly tells him, &quot;I&#x27;m not your father!&quot; in the episode &quot;Peter&#x27;s Two Dads&quot;, in which Peter realizes that Francis is not his true father, implying he knew that Peter is not his biological son. Peter and his family live in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, which is modeled after Providence, Rhode Island.

Peter primarily worked as a safety inspector at the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory until his boss, Jonathan Weed, choked to death on a dinner roll while dining with Peter and Lois; he then became a fisherman on his own boat, which was known as the &quot;S.S. &quot;More Powerful than Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and The Incredible Hulk Put Together&quot;&quot;, with the help of two Portuguese immigrants, Santos and Pasqual, until his boat was destroyed. He now works in the shipping department of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery. Peter briefly played for the NFL&#x27;s New England Patriots until his behavior resulted in his being kicked off the team in the episode episode.

In several cutaway gags Peter is shown to have previously held many jobs which require higher education, despite the blue-collar nature of most of his previous jobs: for instance working as a United Nations interpreter, a sonologist, an opera singer (with a band composed of four identical-looking men who call themselves &quot;The Four Peters&quot;), a bomb defuser, etc.

In a running gag, storylines are randomly interrupted by extremely long, unexpected fights between Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken, an anthropomorphic chicken who serves as an archenemy to Peter. These battles parody the action film genre, with explosions, high-speed chases, and immense devastation to the town of Quahog.

== Character ==

=== Creation ===
MacFarlane initially conceived &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). During college, he created his thesis film entitled &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;, which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company. Then in 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; entitled &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;. Executives at Fox saw the &quot;Larry&quot; shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled &quot;Family Guy&quot;, based on the characters. Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000. Several aspects of &quot;Family Guy&quot; were inspired by the &quot;Larry&quot; shorts. While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian. MacFarlane stated that the difference between &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; was that &quot;&quot;Life of Larry&quot; was shown primarily in my dorm room and &quot;Family Guy&quot; was shown after the Super Bowl.&quot;

=== Voice ===
The voice of Peter is provided by MacFarlane, who also provides the voice for Brian, Stewie, Quagmire, Tom Tucker, Carter Pewterschmidt, Dr. Hartman, and others. MacFarlane has been part of the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, and has voiced Peter from the start. MacFarlane chose to voice Peter and several other characters himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane&#x27;s speaking voice is not very close to Peter&#x27;s; he uses his normal voice as the voice of Brian. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from the security guards he overheard talking while he was attending the Rhode Island School of Design; according to him, &quot;I knew a thousand Peter Griffins growing up in New England. Guys who would not think before they spoke, like [switching to Peter&#x27;s voice] there was no self-editing mechanism. [Pointing to himself] Everything in here, [pointing to his front] it&#x27;s coming out here, with no gateway&quot;. MacFarlane also voices many of Peter&#x27;s ancestors who share the same type of voice. He noted in an interview that he voices Peter and the rest of the characters partly because they initially had a small budget, but also that he prefers to have the freedom to do it himself. In another interview, he said that Peter&#x27;s voice is one of the most difficult to do.

There have been rare occasions where MacFarlane does not voice Peter. In the episode &quot;No Meals on Wheels&quot; (season 5, 2007), actor Patrick Stewart voiced Peter in a cutscene, but MacFarlane voices Peter for the rest of the episode. In the episode &quot;Family Gay&quot; (season 7, 2009), Seth Rogen provided a guest-voice as Peter under the effects of the &quot;Seth Rogen gene&quot;. In &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot; (season 8, 2009), he was voiced by actor Jamison Yang, who was required for a scene where everything in the world was Japanese. In Friends of Peter G (season 9, 2011), John Viener voiced Peter in an alternate timeline where he gave up drinking.

=== Personality ===
Peter Griffin is a stereotypical blue-collar worker who frequently goes to a local bar with his neighbors and friends Cleveland Brown, Joe Swanson and Glenn Quagmire named &quot;The Drunken Clam,&quot; Quahog&#x27;s main tavern. In the season 4 episode &quot;Petarded&quot;, Peter discovered his low intellect falls slightly below the level for intellectual disability after taking an I.Q. test, which places his I.Q. at around 70. In that same episode, Peter is declared intellectually disabled because of his low I.Q. level. Peter also might have brain damage in Wernicke&#x27;s area as he cutaways into seemingly random situations and speaks in perfect grammar but cannot seem to choose how to create a sentence. Peter is known for his brash impulsiveness, which has led to several awkward situations, such as attempting to molest Meg in order to adopt a redneck lifestyle. He is easily influenced by anyone he finds interesting and will often try to replicate their lifestyle and behavior merely out of curiosity. He is incredibly jealous of other attractions Lois has in her life, an attitude which has led to extreme situations, such as when he assaulted a whale that kissed Lois at SeaWorld. In the third season episode &quot;Stuck Together, Torn Apart&quot;, Peter and Lois split up because of Peter&#x27;s jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw and the two decide to live together with their mutually jealous nature. Peter has a very short attention span which frequently leads him to bizarre situations, as Chris points out in &quot;Long John Peter&quot;, after Peter&#x27;s parrot dies &quot;He will get over it pretty quickly and then move on to another wacky thing&quot;, to which Peter finds a pipe organ and forgets about his parrot (Peter then destroys the pipe organ within seconds and then finds a deed to a cattle ranch). Peter is also naïve with one example in &quot;Airport &#x27;07&quot; where he thinks his truck will fly by filling it with airplane fuel.

Peter has complex relationships with all three of his children. He normally makes fun of Meg since season six and treats her with neglect, such as in the episode &quot;FOX-y Lady&quot;, where he, Meg and Chris try to create a cartoon and they exclude Meg and her ideas. Though in some episodes Peter has had a good relationship with Meg, in &quot;Hell Comes to Quahog&quot; (season 5, 2006), Peter almost tells Meg he loves her and in &quot;Road to Rupert&quot; (season 5, 2007), he told Meg that he would treat her badly in front of the family, but that he would be her friend in secret. It was presumed though that in &quot;Peter&#x27;s Sister&quot; (season 14, 2015), that Peter would stop bullying Meg. Peter has a much better, but usually one-sided, relationship with Stewie. Peter and Stewie had their adventures when he took him to Walt Disney World Resort in the episode &quot;The Courtship of Stewie&#x27;s Father&quot; (season 4, 2005). With Chris, Peter communicates well, but at times when in need of advice or in an adventure Peter tells Chris to do the opposite of what he should do, like in &quot;Long John Peter&quot; (season 6, 2008), where Chris is asking for advice on dating and Peter tells him to treat women horribly.

Peter is best friends with his human-like dog, Brian. In earlier seasons, Brian often served as a voice of reason for Peter, helping him out with issues. Brian is extremely grateful to Peter for picking him up on the side of the road as a stray, shown during a flashback in the episode, &quot;&quot;. His gratitude was affirmed in &quot;New Kidney in Town&quot;, where Brian offers to give up both his kidneys and his life so that Peter could undergo a kidney transplant, although he did not have to do it thanks to another, more suitable donor being found. At Brian&#x27;s funeral in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, Peter said that Brian was his &quot;best friend in the whole world&quot; and &quot;like a brother to him&quot;. In the episode &quot;Forget-Me-Not&quot;, Stewie puts Brian and Peter, along with Joe and Quagmire in a simulation to prove that they would have never been friends if Peter wasn&#x27;t Brian&#x27;s owner, wherein they all wake up in a hospital after a great disaster of some kind and forget both their names. In the simulation, Joe and Quagmire believe that Peter was the cause of everybody in Quahog disappearing in the great disaster due to a fake newspaper clipping from a laser tag arena that they had visited with Peter earlier in the episode. Brian, who learns of Joe and Quagmire&#x27;s plans, goes to talk to Peter to warn him, only for them to quickly bond and become great friends with each other. When Joe and Quagmire come to kill him, Brian saves Peter&#x27;s life by taking a bullet for Peter, wherein the simulation then ends and Stewie reveals what happened to him.

Beyond Brian and his main trio of Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland, Peter is shown to be good friends with a few other characters in the show. Peter is shown to be acquaintances with local pharmacist Mort Goldman, even once going as far to assist Mort in committing insurance fraud by burning down his pharmacy. Mort even becomes Peter&#x27;s manager when Peter and Quagmire become a musical duo in the episode &quot;Into Harmony&#x27;s Way&quot;. Peter and his core friend group are also shown to be good friends with Jerome, who initially served as Cleveland&#x27;s temporary replacement in the episode he was first introduced (due to Cleveland living in Virginia at the time). Jerome would later buy the Drunken Clam in the episode &quot;Save the Clam&quot; and often interacts with Peter and the gang at the Clam. Peter and his friends even watch over the bar for Jerome in the episode &quot;The Woof of Wall Street&quot;. Peter also maintains a friendly relationship with his co-workers Opie and Stella.

=== Ancestry ===
Before Peter was born, his mother Thelma went to Mexico City to have an abortion but gave birth during the procedure, and smuggled him home to Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent his childhood. Peter was raised by Francis and Thelma Griffin in the Roman Catholic faith. In &quot;Peter&#x27;s Two Dads&quot;, he discovers that his biological father is an Irishman named Mickey McFinnigan. Peter visits Mickey, who initially rejects him. Mickey later accepts him as his son after beating him in the &quot;game of drink&quot; (the game of drink referring to matching shots until one passes out). Mickey is based on the friends of MacFarlane&#x27;s father. MacFarlane said: &quot;When I was growing up, my father had lots of friends: big, vocal, opinionated New England, Irish Catholics. They were all bursting at the seams with personality, and &quot;Family Guy&quot; came out of a lot of those archetypes that I spent years observing.&quot;

== Reception ==

=== Praise ===
Editors of &quot;Variety&quot; put &quot;Family Guy&quot; in their contenders for the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series; they stated that, depending on your sense of humor, Peter is either &quot;a comedy genius&quot; or &quot;an obnoxious idiot&quot;. MacFarlane has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance category several times for voicing Peter and other characters; he won in 2016. He was also nominated in 2008 for an Annie Award in the Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production or Short Form for voicing Peter.

Peter has ranked in several of IGN&#x27;s top 10s (generally these lists are related to the show). Among these, Peter ranked the third spot on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 &quot;Family Guy&quot; Characters,&quot; in which it was stated that many of the show&#x27;s best gags come from Peter and his shenanigans and that &quot;Peter practically invented the &quot;manatee joke&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed Peter in its &quot;18 Bad TV Dads&quot; list (the list also included characters like Homer Simpson and Al Bundy).

=== Criticism and controversy ===
Peter has been criticized for being too similar to Homer Simpson. Peter has appeared in some episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; in some of these episodes he has been featured in, he has been depicted as Homer Simpson&#x27;s clone or is accused of plagiarism. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Peter is Homer Simpson &quot;as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows&quot;. Robin Pierson from &quot;The TV Critic&quot; criticized the Griffin family for being too similar to the Simpson family, and said that Peter &quot;has Homer Simpson written all over him&quot;. This is eventually made fun of in the episode &quot;Ratings Guy&quot; when, after Peter ruins television and goes to the networks to reverse the changes, Homer Simpson shows up with the same plight, with Peter going &quot;A-ha! Looks like this is one &quot;we&quot; beat &quot;you&quot; to!&quot; In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, a crossover episode between &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the Griffins end up in the town of Springfield after their car is stolen, where they meet the Simpsons.

Peter has created some controversy in various episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot;. The episode &quot;The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire&quot; (season 4, 2005) featured a sequence titled &quot;You Have AIDS&quot;, in which Peter dances and sings in a barbershop quartet fashion around the bed of a man with end-stage AIDS about his diagnosis, which drew protests from several AIDS service organizations. In the episode &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot; (season 3, 2003), Peter sings a parody song of &quot;When You Wish upon a Star&quot;, entitled &quot;I Need a Jew&quot;; on October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of infringing its copyright on the original song; Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a &quot;thinly veiled&quot; copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. The complaint was not upheld.

== Cultural influence ==

=== Appearances in the media ===
Peter has made several television appearances outside of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, often in the form of direct parody. Peter has appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, poking fun at how the two shows are frequently compared to each other. In the fourteenth season episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XIII&quot;, Peter is depicted as one of Homer Simpson&#x27;s clones, and in the seventeenth season episode, &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;, photos of Peter and Stan Smith are in a book of criminals, which says they are wanted for &quot;plagiarismo&quot; and &quot;plagiarismo di plagiarismo&quot; respectively. In the Futurama direct to video film &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, Philip J. Fry is seen nailing a &quot;Family Guy 12 laughs a year&quot; calendar which has Peter and Stewie on the cover. Peter also appeared in various episodes of the show&#x27;s spin-off &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;. In addition, Peter has appeared at the end of the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;Hurricane!&quot; with guns on both Stan Smith and former neighbor Cleveland Brown. During the stand-off, Stan accidentally shoots his wife Francine, which Peter declares as &quot;classic &quot;American Dad!&quot;&quot;.

=== Merchandise ===
Peter is also featured on the &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot; CD, and plays a significant part in &quot;Family Guy Video Game!&quot;, the first &quot;Family Guy&quot; video game, which was released by 2K Games in 2006. Peter was used in the game &quot;Family Guy Online&quot; as a character class for the game&#x27;s character creator. In December 2023, Peter was featured as a battle pass skin in the first season of the fifth chapter of &quot;Fortnite&quot;. Files containing clips of Peter were data mined from the game as early as February 2021.

MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Peter&#x27;s voice and other &quot;Family Guy&quot; characters for a 2007 pinball machine based the show, created by Stern Pinball. In 2004, the first series of &quot;Family Guy&quot; toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz; each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released, with various forms of Peter. Alongside the action figures, Peter has been included in various other &quot;Family Guy&quot;-related merchandise.

As of 2009, six books have been released about the &quot;Family Guy&quot; universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. This include &quot;Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot; (), which covers the entire events of the episode &quot;It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot;, and &quot;Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded&quot; (), a collection of 17 essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers. which include Peter as a character. Peter appears in comic-book based on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; universe; by Titan Comics. The first comic book was released July 27, 2011.

In 2008, the character appeared in advertisements for Subway, promoting the restaurant&#x27;s massive feast sandwich. Chief marketing officer Tony Pace commented &quot;Peter&#x27;s a good representation of the people who are interested in the Feast, and &quot;Family Guy&quot; is a show &quot;that appeals to that target audience.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; critic Brian Steinberg praised the restaurant&#x27;s use of the character for the commercials.

<doc id="901200" wikidata="Q275243" url="?curid=901200" title="Pototan">
<text>Pototan (, , ), is a 1st class municipality in the province of Iloilo, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 78,298 people.

In December 1997, it was declared as the &quot;Christmas Capital of Western Visayas&quot; because of its famed Christmas Festival of Lights.

==History==

===Early history===
The first people of Pototan were the family of Datu Ramon, grandson of Datu Puti, a Malay from the town of Dumangas. They first settled at Barangay Naslo, which was formerly the poblacion (town center). In that place was found a luxuriant growth of trees called &quot;putat&quot;, after which the place was subsequently called &quot;Kaputatan&quot; or &quot;place of many Putat trees.&quot; However, due to its hilly terrain and poor water supply, they decided to move nearer the bank of the Suage River, now called Pototan.

In the middle of the 16th century, the Chinese traders arrived in Pototan.

===Spanish era===

The arrival of the Spaniards in 1593 sparked new changes in the socio-economic and political life of the natives. It was the start of a new era, the natives were converted to Catholicism through the efforts of Augustinian Friars. The settlement was subsequently made into a Parish. Education, though at the onset only for the privileged few, was introduced. The name &quot;Kaputatan&quot;, which the Spanish have difficulty pronouncing, was changed to &quot;Pototan&quot;.

The Spanish built roads and bridges. Don Tomas Sajen and Don Escribano supervised the construction of the Tribunal (municipal hall) with the natives contributing the labor. The Tribunal withstood World War II and in the early 50s was modified into what is now the Western Visayas Hospital.

In 1874, Pototanons began to run their own political affairs with the appointment of Don Juan Marcelo as the first Capitan Municipal. This form of government continued until the arrival of the Americans.

During the incumbency of Capitan Municipal Braulio Peñaranda in 1891, there was a cholera outbreak.

During the Philippine Revolution, Pototanons such as Teresa Magbanua (known as the Joan of arc of the Visayas) and her two brothers, Elias and Pascual Magbanua took up arms and joined the revolution.

The Americans arrived after Spain ceded Philippines to the United States in 1898. The remaining Spanish population fled to the hills together with many Filipinos including the last Gobernadorcillio, Don Maurilio Mendoza. He was later held prisoner by the Americans but subsequently named the first Municipal President.

===American era===
Under the Americans, the natives were granted the freedom of speech and worship. Education was liberalized; more and better roads and bridges were constructed. Improvements were also noticed in the economic, social and cultural life of the people.

During the incumbency of Mun. President Maurillo Mendoza, the Pototanons again witnessed another unforgettable event: the burning of the entire half of the poblacion in November 1914. The cause of the fire is unknown.

When the Philippine Constitution was ratified in 1935, another change in the town&#x27;s local governance was introduced: the title of Municipal President was changed to Municipal Mayor. Santiago Puig was the first Municipal Mayor. He was succeeded by Mariano Peñaflorida in 1940. Peñaflorida served until September 16, 1942.

===World War II===
The coming of the Japanese during World War II spread chaos and fear among Pototanons. Mayor Peñaflorida continued to act as Mayor under the Free Revolutionary Government of Tomas Confesor while the Japanese Imperial Forces designated Tomas Ferrariz as Puppet Mayor.

==Geography==

<text>Tammin Sursok (born 19 August 1983) is an Australian and American actress. She is best known for her roles on television as Dani Sutherland on &quot;Home and Away&quot;, Colleen Carlton on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and Jenna Marshall on &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;.

==Early life==
Sursok was born to musicians Daryl and Julie Sursok in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa. When she was six, her family immigrated to Australia. Early on, Sursok was involved with the Sydney Youth Musical Theatre where she pursued her interests in acting, music, and dance. She also studied at the Trinity Speech and Drama College. Sursok was educated at Ravenswood School for Girls, in Gordon, Sydney, studying speech and drama in her final years of school.

==Career==

===2000–2004: &quot;Home and Away&quot;===
In 1999, after completing Year 10, Sursok acquired an agent and landed her first audition for a role in the long-running Australian drama series &quot;Home and Away&quot;. She was cast in the role of Dani Sutherland, the rebellious eldest daughter of the Sutherland family who took over the running of the Caravan Park. The actress considered herself lucky to get the part, calling the experience &quot;incredible&quot;. In an interview with &quot;TeenHollywood&quot; she stated, &quot;It was my first audition, so I thought it always worked like that, and you always get your first audition, but that is not the case.&quot; Sursok&#x27;s performance in the role earned her a win for the Logie Award for Most Popular New Female Talent beating out Caroline Craig, Madeleine West and Karina Brown. Sursok&#x27;s performance earned her a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress, losing out to &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; star Lisa Chappell.

===2004–2006: &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot;===
Sursok left &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 2004 so that she could pursue a music career, and acting opportunities, in the United States. &quot;I&#x27;m 21 and it&#x27;s time to be more creative. It is scary, but I had to leave before I became stale.&quot; In 2004, Sursok acknowledged that she was signed to Sony BMG Music Entertainment, confirming reports that recording for her debut studio album had begun.

Sursok&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot;, was released on 22 May 2005, under Sony Music Entertainment with songwriters Savan Kotecha, David Kreuger, Marion Raven, Steve Booker; and producers John Shanks, Per Mangusson and David Kreuger. &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot; made its debut on the ARIA Albums Chart at number thirteen. During its second week on the charts, it remained at its peak position of #13; however, during its third week, it had a significant drop by 23 spots, landing the album at No. 36. During its fourth week, it fell further landing at No. 43. It ended its run on 20 June, falling completely off the charts and has not charted since. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Pointless Relationship&quot;, debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at No. 7 before peaking at No. 5, spending 15 weeks on the charts. Upon the song&#x27;s release, it quickly shot to No. 1 on the Australian Top 100 Radio Airplay Chart, becoming the highest charting debut single in years. &quot;Pointless Relationship&quot; certified Platinum in Australia. The second single, &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot;, debuted at No. 13 on the ARIA Singles Chart and spent a total of 18 weeks on the charts. &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot; was the 98th best-selling single of 2005 in Australia. The third and final single off &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Thing&quot;, quickly debuted on the ARIA Singles chart at No. 30. The song peaked at No. 6, spending 12 weeks on the charts. &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Thing&quot; became the second most downloaded song in its debut week, after Rob Thomas&#x27;s &quot;This Is How a Heart Breaks&quot;. It also peaked at No. 49 on the Australian Top 100 Radio Airplay Chart, becoming her lowest charting single.

After the success of her album, &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot;, plans were made to launch Sursok in the UK, but these unexpectedly fell through due to changes at her record label. The title track, &quot;Whatever Will Be&quot;, was covered by Vanessa Hudgens for her RIAA-certified debut album, &quot;V&quot;.

===2006–present: Focus on films and television work===
After her UK plans fell through, Sursok relocated from Australia to Los Angeles, California in 2006 in order to concentrate on her acting career. That same year, she made her film debut in a bit role in the film &quot;Aquamarine&quot;.

In 2007, after a successful audition, Sursok became the third actress to portray Colleen Carlton on the American soap opera television series, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Her debut was quickly met with criticism from a number of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; viewers. Despite the negativity, she received comparable positive viewer feedback. &quot;The fans have been really great.&quot; In preparation for the role, Sursok tried to catch up on Colleen&#x27;s history. &quot;I watched the last six months of episodes,&quot; she said. &quot;My boyfriend used to date a girl who was obsessed with &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;, so he knew everything about it and brought me up to speed, as well.&quot; Sursok earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for her portrayal of Colleen the following year. After two years in the role, Sursok departed causing the writers to kill off Colleen. In an interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; in October 2009, Sursok said it was difficult to pursue outside projects and appear on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as well. Her departure was a mutual decision between Sursok and the showrunners.

In 2009, Sursok starred in the Nickelodeon made-for-television musical film &quot;Spectacular!&quot; portraying the role of Courtney, the lead singer in a high school choir which is fading in popularity. Sursok recorded over three tracks for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which debuted at No. 44 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The film premiered on 16 February 2009, to over 3.7 million viewers. The &quot;soundtrack&quot;, recorded in 2008, was released on 3 February 2009, with Sursok appearing on seven songs on the album, including two solos. The soundtrack peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200.

From July 2010 to January 2011, Sursok had a recurring role on the Disney Channel Original Series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;. She appeared in eight episodes. In 2010, Sursok was cast in ABC Family&#x27;s adaptation of the Sara Shepard teen mystery book series, &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;. Sursok was cast as Jenna Marshall, a teenage girl who is left blind after a prank gone wrong. The series premiered in June that same year to over 2.47 million viewers. In June 2013, Sursok announced that she would continue her role as Jenna through her pregnancy.

She played Sarah Corso in the indie film &quot;Driving By Braille&quot;, directed by Kristina Lloyd and written by Richard H. Moon, released on DVD in May 2013. The story tells of a young woman who relives childhood trauma when she senses her boyfriend is about to propose, and who must sort through the crippling fear and doubt that is holding her back before her past destroys the couple&#x27;s future.

In 2014, after several reports of Sursok indicating she was returning to music, she released a collaboration with singer Joe Brooks, covering &quot;Say Something&quot; made famous by A Great Big World featuring Christina Aguilera.

In January 2022, Sursok joined the cast of Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; as fashion designer and businesswoman Montana Marcel. Her first appearance was on 13 April 2022.

==Personal life==
On 24 August 2011, Sursok married her boyfriend, actor, producer, and director Sean McEwen, in Florence, Italy. Sursok signed an exclusive deal with the Australian magazine &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; to publish the couple&#x27;s wedding photos In April 2013, Sursok revealed that her movie &quot;Sleeping Around&quot; was filmed in the middle of her wedding. The couple have two daughters, born in October 2013 and January 2019. Sursok also has three dogs.

On 16 March 2016, Sursok posted a photo of herself as an adolescent on Instagram and revealed that she had been bullied because of her weight. The post was part of her #ThisIsBeautiful hashtag campaign which aims to empower people and change the message around beauty standards. The accompanying post read: For all of you being bullied out there. This is me. Growing up I was overweight and spent most of my adolescence being bullied because of it. I definitely wasn&#x27;t the popular girl, but it didn&#x27;t define me. You can be ANYTHING you want to be in your life. It&#x27;s your choice which path you take. Don&#x27;t let other people&#x27;s words give you your self-worth. You are beautiful. I was beautiful. It just took me a long time to love myself. #thisisbeautiful

In 2019, Sursok became an American citizen; however, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she—along with McEwen and their daughters—returned to Australia after being offered a movie role based in Brisbane in 2021, quarantined, and stated in an interview in March 2022 on &quot;The Morning Show&quot; that she had &quot;accidentally&quot; moved back to Australia.

<doc id="901204" wikidata="Q269727" url="?curid=901204" title="Émilie Heymans">
<text>Émilie-Joane Heymans (born December 14, 1981) is a Canadian diver. She was born in Brussels, Belgium and raised in Greenfield Park, a suburb of Montreal. Heymans has won four Olympic medals, two bronze and two silver. She was the first female diver to win medals in four consecutive Olympic games and the first Canadian to win medals in four consecutive Olympics. Heymans also is a one time world champion and has won four Pan American championships as well as one Commonwealth Games championship. In addition she has won multiple medals in all three of these competitions.

==Career==
Before becoming a diver, Heymans was a gymnast. She began diving in 1993, at age 11, after her coaches told her she did not have the physique to be a gymnast. Emilie made her international debut with Anne Montminy at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, where they won a silver medal in the 10m synchronized diving event. Heymans then set her sights on the 10m platform and became the 2003 World Champion in Barcelona. At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she proved herself again in the 10m synchronized diving event when she, along with teammate Blythe Hartley, took home the bronze medal.

Going into the 2008 Summer Olympics she failed to qualify with partner Marie-Eve Marleau in the platform synchro event, which was considered a huge upset. In order to qualify for the 2008 games, Heymans had to re-focus on the solo platform, an event where she had failed to medal in two Olympics in a row. Heymans won the silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics in the 10m individual event, and only a solid final dive by the Chinese competitor kept her off of the top of the podium. This medal secured her recognition as an outstanding diver in both individual and synchronized diving events. She had won medals in three consecutive Olympics, achieved by only five other Canadian Olympians.

The years of abuse her body suffered as a result of platform diving caused pernicious neck and shoulder injuries, which compelled a switch to the springboard. In 2009, Heymans won the silver medal at the World Championships in Rome in the 3M springboard. In 2011, at the World Championships in Shanghai, Heymans, with partner Jennifer Abel, won the silver medal in the 3m synchro event.

At the 2012 Olympics, Émilie became the first Canadian Summer Olympian to win a medal in four straight Olympics, winning a bronze medal in 3m synchronized diving, along with partner Abel. Sylvie Bernier, a CBC Sports analyst and former gold medal diver, said of Heymans that &quot;Emilie has won a medal at four straight Games and with three different partners. She has a quiet confidence and always believes she can do it. She doesn&#x27;t need to tell the whole world.&quot; Heymans herself said of her record-setting medal, &quot;It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;m really happy that I was able to win my fourth medal with Jennifer. We worked really hard over the last two years.&quot;

In January 2013, Heymans retired from the sport.

==Personal life==
Born in Brussels, Heymans moved with her family to Quebec after her mother competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal as a fencer. Her mother, Marie-Paule Van Eyck, was an Olympic fencer for Belgium.

<text>Disodium guanylate, also known as sodium 5&#x27;-guanylate and disodium 5&#x27;-guanylate, is a natural sodium salt of the flavor enhancing nucleotide guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Disodium guanylate is a food additive with the E number E627. It is commonly used in conjunction with glutamic acid.

As it is a fairly expensive additive, it is usually not used independently of glutamic acid; if disodium guanylate is present in a list of ingredients but MSG does not appear to be, it is likely that glutamic acid is provided as part of another ingredient such as a processed soy protein complex. It is often added to foods in conjunction with disodium inosinate; the combination is known as disodium 5&#x27;-ribonucleotides.

Disodium guanylate is produced by fermentation. It is often added to instant noodles, potato chips and other snacks, savory rice, tinned vegetables, cured meats, and packaged soup.

<text>Raymond Francis Meagher (born 4 July 1944) is an Australian actor, who has appeared in Australian film and television since the mid-1970s. He is notable as the longest continuing performer in an Australian television role, portraying Alf Stewart on &quot;Home and Away&quot;, having played the role since the first episode in 1988. Meagher won a Gold Logie Award for his role in &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 2010 and has currently played the role of Alf for over 37 years.

==Early life==
Meagher was born and raised on a sheep and cattle station in Queensland, before attending a boarding school on the Gold Coast from the age of nine. He became a keen sportsman at high school, Marist College Ashgrove in Brisbane, representing the school at a number of sports including rugby union, a sport which he ultimately played at state level.

Meagher played at first five eighth for Queensland at senior level in the late 1960s, including playing against France.

==Career==

===Film===
Meagher played Sergeant Drummond in the 1980 war drama &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;, which he said was one of his favourite roles. His other film appearances include &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; (1978), &quot;Newsfront&quot; (1978), &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979), &quot;The Shiralee (1987),&quot; &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot; (1976), &quot;Money Movers&quot; (1978), &quot;The Odd Angry Shot&quot; (1979), &quot;The Earthling&quot; (1980), &quot;Hoodwink&quot; (1981), &quot;Runaway Island&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Fire in the Stone&quot; (1984). He had a cameo in the 1979 war comedy &quot;The Odd Angry Shot&quot;.

===Television===
Meagher first appeared on television as host of the late night ABC folk music programme &quot;Around Folk&quot; in June–August 1973. His first regular acting work on television was in the soap opera &quot;Number 96&quot;, briefly appearing as Fred Shrimpton in 1977. Meagher became &quot;a much in demand character actor&quot;, with his early television roles including &quot;Matlock Police&quot;, &quot;Ben Hall&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;Certain Women&quot;, &quot;Pig in a Poke&quot;, &quot;The Restless Years&quot;, &quot;Glenview High&quot;, &quot;The Oracle&quot;, &quot;Kingswood Country&quot;, &quot;Cop Shop&quot;, &quot;Skyways&quot;, &quot;Sporting Chance&quot;, &quot;Holiday Island&quot;, and &quot;Bellamy&quot;. Subsequent television acting roles included three different roles as villains in &quot;Prisoner&quot;, including Geoff Butler between 1979 and 1980, Kurt Renner in 1984, and Ernest Craven in 1986. He also had two different guest starring roles in &quot;A Country Practice&quot; and substantial roles in several 1980s miniseries.

In 1984, Meagher was cast in the Nine Network miniseries &quot;A Fortunate Life&quot;, based on Albert Facey&#x27;s book of the same name. He plays the role of evil cattle-rustler Bad Bob. Marie Ussher of &quot;TV Week&quot; observed that Meagher was often cast as the &quot;baddie&quot; or tough, ruthless characters in his early career. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Five Mile Creek&quot; as Irish bushranger Lightning Ridge. Meagher won a Penguin Award for his starring role in &quot;Mail Order Bride&quot; (1984) for the ABC. He filmed the 12-part series &quot;Five Times Dizzy&quot; in Sydney in 1986. Meagher played The Red Headed Person, who was billed as &quot;a tough standover man.&quot; Meagher liked playing &quot;heavy&quot; characters, who showed their lighter sides. While filming &quot;Five Times Dizzy&quot;, Meagher also flew back and forth to Melbourne to film miniseries &quot;The Great Bookie Robbery&quot; in which he plays Bob Temple. During the same period, he also made an appearance in &quot;A Country Practice&quot; as alcoholic, pub owner Wally, followed by a role in television film &quot;The Blue Lightning&quot; for America&#x27;s CBS network.

Meagher joined the cast of soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 1987 and has appeared in the role of Alf Stewart continuously since the first episode aired in January 1988. Meagher holds a Guinness World Record as the longest-serving actor in an Australian serial. Meagher also appeared in the 1988 children&#x27;s series &quot;The True Story of Spit MacPhee&quot;, along with John Bach and Elspeth Ballantyne.

In September 2009, Meagher was the third-highest paid personality on Australian television, behind Eddie McGuire and Rove McManus.

Meagher won the Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television at the 2010 Logie Awards, where he was also nominated for &quot;Most Popular Actor&quot;. Meagher subsequently won that Logie Award in 2018.

===Stage===
In 2007, Meagher took over the role of Bob the mechanic in &quot;Priscilla Queen of the Desert&quot; from Bill Hunter. From 30 September 2010, he took over the role of Bob in the West End production of &quot;Priscilla&quot; until March 2011. In June 2011, it was announced that Meagher would be returning to the West End production from October. He then rejoined the show for its New Zealand tour in 2016.

Meagher regularly travels to the United Kingdom to take part in the traditional Christmas pantomimes. In December 2008, he played Abanazar in a production of &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Anvil Theatre in Basingstoke and in 2009 he performed as Captain Hook in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Assembly Hall Theatre in Royal Tunbridge Wells.

<text>Michael Beckley is an Australian actor. He has worked with major theatre companies in both Australia and the United Kingdom, appearing on London&#x27;s West End in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (starring Rob Lowe) and &quot;Cabaret&quot;. He is best known for playing Rhys Sutherland in Australian television series &quot;Home and Away&quot; from 2000 to 2004.

==Early life==
Beckley decided on an acting career just before completing his senior high school studies. Despite protests from teachers he left school one week before his final exams. A week later – at 17 years of age – he had landed a permanent position on the Entertainment Staff at Old Sydney Town, an historical theme park near his home town of Gosford, NSW. Here he earned his Actors Equity of Australia card and officially became a working actor. 

==Career==

===Acting===
Beckley made his first permanent move to the UK in 1984. He appeared on the London Fringe in &quot;All The Way Home&quot; and attended dozens of plays in and around London, including many on the West End starring actors such as Anthony Hopkins (in &quot;Pravda&quot;) and Glenda Jackson (in &quot;Phaedra&quot;). He also took drop-in acting classes at the London Actors&#x27; Centre studying Chekhov, Shakespeare, comedy, voice and movement. It was during this time in London that he decided to commit to becoming an actor.

On returning to Australia in late 1986 he auditioned for Australia&#x27;s leading drama school NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art) but was not accepted. He studied part-time under Gillian Owen, a RADA-trained actor, who ran the Sydney Acting School, and then auditioned for NIDA again in late 1987. He was accepted, and the next three years saw him studying there full-time.

With just one week of study to go – echoing his departure from high school – Beckley was approached by Wayne Harrison, then-artistic director of Sydney Theatre Company, to appear as Frid in the company&#x27;s production of Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. He appeared opposite a then-unknown Toni Collette as Petra. With the school&#x27;s blessing, Beckley began his post-student career a week earlier than expected and graduated with his class at the official ceremony in early 1991.

The next few years saw Beckley work for various companies in a range of projects. These included a rigorous 6-month T.I.E. (theatre in education) tour for the Bell Shakespeare Company which he still considers as &quot;earning one&#x27;s stripes&quot;. Julia Zemiro was also a cast member.

He had guest roles on the Australian police series &quot;Water Rats&quot; and the Australian/American sci-fi series &quot;Farscape&quot;.

Wayne Harrison invited him back to the STC to appear in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. The prestigious Griffin Theatre Company cast him in &quot;Clark in Sarajevo&quot; and then as the leading role of Dave in Neil Cole&#x27;s play &quot;Alive at Williamstown Pier&quot;, the true story of a politician&#x27;s fight with bipolar disorder and his consequent &#x27;outing&#x27; by the Australian media. Beckley received strong praise for his portrayal from national critics.

Shortly after this, Beckley was cast as Rhys Sutherland in the long-running television program &quot;Home and Away&quot;, where he stayed for just over four years (2000–2004). His character arrived with a wife and three daughters. The Sutherlands went on to be one of the most popular families to ever appear on the program. While on the show, the production company made two specials for release on DVD: &quot;Hearts Divided&quot; and &quot;Secrets and the City&quot;, the latter film concerning Rhys&#x27;s disappearance after the revelation of a previous affair.

Upon leaving &quot;Home and Away&quot; Beckley returned to England in 2005. Signing with a London agent, he booked his first audition, which found him playing Captain Roger Wittaker at the Theatre Royal Haymarket on London&#x27;s West End. The play starred Rob Lowe in the role made famous by Tom Cruise in the film version, which was also written by Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin was very much involved in the casting process. The play ran for several months and was a major success in that year&#x27;s West End calendar.

Beckley was soon cast in David Pownall&#x27;s play &quot;Masterclass&quot; for Derby Theatre playing Joseph Stalin’s right-hand man Andrei Zhdanov, alongside Christopher McKay (&quot;Me and Orson Welles&quot;), Russell Dixon and Terry Mortimer. McKay and Mortimer, accomplished pianists, played a real grand piano in their respective roles of Shostakovich and Prokofiev. Beckley was also required to play some Chopin while seemingly drunk on vodka – a moment in the play that terrified him each night. Although a pianist, he was not as accomplished as McKay and Mortimer. Nonetheless, reviews were exceptional, with most of the London papers including it in their must-see lists.

Beckley continued to enjoy a run of successful and critical theatre roles. He returned to the West End for nearly a year to play Ernst Ludwig in Rufus Norris&#x27; wildly successful &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the Lyric Theatre, London. He played leading man Matt Holden in Chris England&#x27;s play &quot;Breakfast with Jonny Wilkinson&quot; for the (then newly successful) Menier Chocolate Factory, and reprised the role in the film version in 2012.

One of Beckley&#x27;s major roles was that of Randle P McMurphy in &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, based on the novel by Ken Kesey, made particularly famous by the film version starring Jack Nicholson (as Randle P McMurphy). The production was staged by Curve in Leicester, with Catherine Russell as Nurse Ratched. Beckley in fact auditioned for the role of Dale Harding, however, director Michael Buffong decided Beckley was the right man to play McMurphy and offered him the part. During the run of &quot;Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, Curve&#x27;s artistic director Paul Kerryson offered Beckley the role of Bradley in Sam Shephard&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Buried Child&quot;. It starred Olivier Award-winner Matthew Kelly as Dodge. Bradley remains one of Beckley&#x27;s favourite roles.

Kelly and Beckley would work together again in the 5-star hit production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; for Southward Playhouse in London in 2012 (Beckley credits a student production of this play at NIDA, seen in 1979, as being his catalyst for thinking about acting as a career). The Southwark Playhouse production also featured a then-unknown Lily James as Nina. The season was a sell-out.

Derby Theatre asked him back to play Joe Josephson in Sondheim’s &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;. Menier Chocolate Factory also cast him again in &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. The prestigious York Theatre Royal cast him as leading character Dr Robert Smith in the highly acclaimed play &quot;Blue/Orange&quot;.

Beckley also spent three years (2009, 2014, 2015) travelling to 30 countries in the role of Bill Austin in the world-wide hit musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;. It was at the end of his last year with that show that he decided to return to Australia, where he has been since early 2016.

Since returning to his native country Beckley has appeared on the television programs &quot;Here Come The Habibs&quot;, &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot;, &quot;The Secret Daughter&quot; and &quot;House of Bond&quot;, as well as the new Australian musical &quot;Melba&quot; based on the life of opera star Dame Nellie Melba (played by international opera star Emma Matthews).

In 2019, Beckley appeared in the Opera Australia / Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour production of &quot;West Side Story&quot; as Officer Krupke – the titular character of the show&#x27;s famous comedy number &#x27;Gee, Officer Krupke&#x27;. The production was directed by multi-award-winning director Francesca Zambello. It was Beckley&#x27;s first appearance with Opera Australia.

===Directing===
Michael Beckley was resident director on &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; for Australian and New Zealand tours during the 1990s. He began in the chorus as a Phantom and then became Dance Captain. After the first one-year tour, director Nigel Triffitt offered Beckley the position of assistant director for the show&#x27;s New Zealand tour. This position was changed to Resident Director when the show began a new Australian tour starring Jason Donovan in Perth.

Triffitt also used Beckley as his assistant for a revival of his 1990 Melbourne International Arts Festival hit production of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; for Sydney Theatre Company in 1998.

Beckley continued to direct through the late 1990s on shows such as &quot;The Seventh Knob&quot; (Belvoir St Theatre), &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; (Laycock St Theatre, Gosford, 1996, return season 1997), &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (full charity fund-raiser production, 1999) and assisted Jeremy Sims on the hugely successful Pork Chop Production of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (Belvoir St Theatre) and then again on the same company&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Beckley also directed &quot;The Players&quot; for Pork Chop Productions at The Stables Theatre, Sydney.

<text>Tigbauan, officially the Municipality of Tigbauan (; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Iloilo, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 65,245 people.

==History==
=== Spanish colonial era ===
On January 1592, Jesuit missionaries arrived from Luzon to Panay, where they would work at the encomienda of Tigbauan. The Spaniards described the ancient inhabitants of the region to be the Ati people, while the lowlanders were called the Visayans. The missionaries recorded that there had been a war between the Visayan lowlanders and the Negritos before their arrival.

&quot;They call the reed-grass tigbao, and, by derivation, the lands which bear this grass are called Tigbauan; and because the site of this village is close to a great expanse of reedy land on the bank of a beautiful stream, it bears the above name. The village itself was on the same shore, at the mouth of the river—which, as well as the sea, yields various kinds of fish, excellent and plentiful, which I myself have enjoyed in abundance. As they were continually fishing on the beach, usually with three or four nets, they never made a haul without devoutly regaling us with a part of it. Tigbauan has a very beautiful district, with many villages extending more than six leguas along the coast of the sea; the entire district is well supplied with game, fruits, and vegetables, and fish from the sea. The people are very industrious; consequently I always saw them occupied—the men, with their fisheries and farming; the women, with their spinning and weaving. What we accomplished in the two years spent among a people so good and well-disposed towards the Gospel could be told in less time than what we left undone; for, since we of the Society of Jesus were then so few, and had little hope of increasing our number, we did not dare to undertake more than we thought could probably be maintained; and in this we were not mistaken, for at the present day, when at least a dozen ministers are needed, there is actually but one secular priest. For that reason we did not dare to baptize adults or children, except in cases of extreme danger, outside of the chief village (which is Tigbauan) and two or three other outlying hamlets, distant two miles or less.&quot;

: -- Fr. Pedro Chirino, Relacion de las Islas Filipinas, (1604)

During the Spanish period Tigbauan was also the location of a Jesuit Elementary School for Visayan and Spanish boys.

===World War II===
Tigbauan was the site where American forces code-named Victorino I, landed on March 18, 1945, together with the Philippine Commonwealth troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army&#x27;s 61st, 62nd and 63rd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary&#x27;s 6th Infantry Regiment to begin the liberation of Panay. The troops set out from Lingayen Gulf, Luzon on March 14. The 185th Infantry, 40th Division, splashed ashore at Tigbauan, several miles west of Iloilo. There they were greeted by Army Col. Macario L. Peralta&#x27;s Filipino guerrillas and continued with the Philippine Commonwealth troops drawn up in parade formation. General Eichelberger recalled in his memoirs how the guerrillas stood &quot;stiff in starched khaki and resplendent with ornaments.&quot; The strong guerrilla force of 23,000 had secured most of the island&#x27; except the area immediately around Iloilo where 2,750 Japanese were ensconced. The 40th Division quickly swept through the Japanese outposts and then drove the Japanese from the city in two days. Again the Japanese withdrew after the initial fighting into the inaccessible mountain jungles. In the fighting, the Americans lost 20 men, the Filipinos lost 42 men, and the Japanese 80. Responsibility for mopping up was turned over to the Filipino guerrillas and the 2d Battalion, 160th Infantry. Some 1,500 Japanese later surrendered at the end of the war. Because General MacArthur planned to stage two divisions from Iloilo for the invasion of Japan, engineers began repairing the local airfield and starting base construction at once.

==Geography==
The municipality has flat terrain. The plain constitutes approximately 57% of the total area, covering about 6,667 has. along the north-west site of the Sibalom River. Along the boundaries of Guimbal, Leon and Tubungan are rolling hills covering an area of about 1,518 has. The municipality has no forest coverage. The highest point is above sea level and the lowest is one meter above sea level. The town has two main rivers, Sibalom and Tacuyong River. The first originates from the mountain portion of Panay passing through the town of Leon and snaking through the barangays of Cordova Norte and Cordova Sur, Bitas and Bagumbayan, the western portion of the poblacion and empties into Panay Gulf. The second emanates from the junction of Barangay San Rafael, Binaliuan Menor, Nagba, Dorong-an and joins the Sibalom River in the Southern portion of the Poblacion. Aside from the rivers, there are creeks and natural springs, which could be a good source of water supply and could also be used as natural drainage. It is from Iloilo City.

Of the total 8,889 has., 93.78% is devoted to agriculture and allied activities. Of this area, 1,077 has. are planted with coconuts, 4,554 has. are planted with rice and 19 has. are devoted to fishponds. Around 60 has. located in urban areas serve residential, commercial, and institutional purposes.

==Culture==

===Saludan Festival===
Saludan came from the word &quot;salud&quot;. Tigbauan is a coastal town, its sea water abound in different kinds of fish. An excerpt from a book, “The Philippine Islands,” by Blair and Robertson; 1493. 1898; Vol. XII, pp. 217, 219-220 of which Fr. Pedro Chirino related his experience and observations about the town states that, “The village itself was on the same shore, at the mouth of the river, of which I myself have enjoyed in abundance. As they were continually fishing on the beach, usually with three or four nets, they never made a haul without devoutly is regaling us with a part of it.”

Since the beginning of recorded history, fishermen have used nets or woven bamboos to catch fish from the sea or rivers, and in the local dialect they call this salud.

On the other hand, aside from winter resources, our forests, farmers and hills are also abound in rich natural resources.

The book further states that “Tigbauan has a very beautiful district with many villages extending more than six leagues along the coast of the sea; the entire district is well supplied with game, fruits, and vegetables and fish from the sea. The people are very industrious and always pre-occupied the men with their fisheries and farming, the women with their spinning and weaving…” Primarily, their farm product is rice. Whether crude farming ways and tools or modern agricultural machineries are used we use the term salud. In threshing rice using the old method or the modern equipment – kita nagasalud man gihapon. Their tuba is famous for its sweetness and as practiced and tuba ginasalud kang salud, and salud also means the method of catching &quot;hipon&quot; or shrimp (&quot;Salud ta sa Palupadan&quot;). The term was coined by then, Sangguniang Bayan Member Rexfel G. Trivilegio of Barangay Atabayan, Tigbauan, Iloilo. Thus, the Saludan Festival was born.

===Adlaw sang Tigbauan===

During the first term of Mayor of Tigbauan Myrna M. Torres in 1998, she signed an Executive Order declaring the third Friday of October every as the “&quot;Adlaw sang Tigbauan&quot;”.

History tells us that because of the increase in population in Sirawagan area (the place where the Bornean datus settled), the families from the tribes of Labing-Isog and Mangwalis sought for greener pasture. Following the course of the rising sun they landed in the place which they called “Katigbawan” because of the plentiful growth of giant grasses known to them as “tigbaw”. This place was said to be Parara by word of mouth handed down from generation to generation, it is believed that the families of Labing-Isog and Mangwalis reached the place when the native feasted for bountiful rice.

To the present time, the season for gathering rice crop is mostly in October. During this time of the year the fishermen also rejoice for a bountiful sea catch. Thus, “Adlaw Sang Tigbauan” is celebrated in October. To make this day more significant, the “Saludan Festival” was launched.

Tigbauan is one of Iloilo&#x27;s treasure troves, packed with &quot;gems&quot; from more than a millennium of historical significance. With one foot in the past, and the other in the present, Tigbauan allows every visitor a glimpse of its heady blend of architectural masterpieces and natural wonder. The town&#x27;s 134 years of history are on display when you look.

The town delights in its St. John of Sahagun Parish. Constructed using forced labor under Fray Florencio Martin in 1867, its beautiful baroque facade in rococo finish, gives visitors a glimpse of the community&#x27;s intense spirituality. The church&#x27;s remarkable architecture with its façade and tower, survived the ravages of the Second World War and the great earthquake in 1948. Presently, the mystical beauty of its altar depicts heaven and Dante&#x27;s Inferno; the church walls with the Way of the Cross, all done in intricate mosaics of colored stones is a sight not to be missed. On its churchyard remained a marker of what used to be the site of the first Jesuit boarding school for boys in the Philippines established in 1592 and renowned that time for their liturgical music during church services.

The beach in Barangay Parara was the landing site of America&#x27;s 40th Infantry Division to liberate Panay and Romblon during the Second World War on March 18, 1945. The same area became the landing site in the 13th century of the descendants of the Bornean datus.

==Education==

Tigbauan has 21 public elementary schools, seven private schools, five primary schools, 45 day care centers, 10 national high (Secondary) schools, four private preparatory schools, and one Catholic kindergarten school. Schools are encouraged to establish and maintain biological/ vegetable garden and participate in the coastal and environmental cleanup and tree planting.

<text>Alexandre Despatie (; born June 8, 1985) is a Canadian diver and broadcaster from Laval, Quebec. He was the world champion at the 1 and 3 m springboards from 2005 to 2007 and is the first, and so far only, diver to have been world champion in all three individual categories (1, 3 and 10 m platform). He is also a 37-time Canadian senior diving champion and nine-time junior champion, and the most decorated male diver in Canadian history, winning two Olympic silver medals and reaching eight podiums at the world championships, including three gold medals. He was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

== Diving career ==
Despatie began diving at the age of 5 in his own backyard pool.

He first came to public attention at the 1998 Commonwealth Games with an extremely impressive gold medal on the 10 metre platform (which included an unprecedented score of perfect 10s). He was only 13 years old at the time, and the achievement was recorded in the Guinness Book Of World Records 2000.

At the Olympic games in Sydney in 2000, with a 4th-place finish at the 10-metre platform, he was offered the chance to compete in the springboard event in those Games as well, when one of the Canadian divers had to withdraw from the meet due to complications with his citizenship, but declined because he had not been training for that event.

He won the silver medal at the world championships in 2001 in Fukuoka, Japan in the same event, and in 2003 won a gold medal at the World Diving Championships in Barcelona, Spain in the 10 metre platform. He recorded 107.1 for his last dive, which set a new record.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Despatie won the gold medal in the three-metre springboard event, followed by three gold medals at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, he won the silver medal in the men&#x27;s 3 metre springboard competition, but finished out of the medal standings in fourth place in the 10 metre platform. This result was contrary to expectations going into the games, where he was expected to win silver or gold in the 10 metre platform event and not place in the 3 metre springboard.

In front of his home crowd at the 2005 World Aquatic Championships in Montreal, he became World Champion on the 3 metre springboard. He won with a world record score of 813.60 points, his &quot;worst&quot; dive being rated an average 8.5. Despatie followed up on that performance by winning the 1 m springboard, with a world record score of 489.69. His victory meant that he had won FINA World Titles on both springboard and platform.

Despatie successfully defended his three-meter springboard title at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and also won gold medals on 1 m springboard and 3 m synchronized with Arturo Miranda. He finished 3rd in the 10m platform.

Returning to Melbourne, this time for the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Despatie went head to head with the best divers in the world, including the top-ranked Chinese diving team. Finishing 8th in the 10 m tower event and winning silver medals in the 3 m event and the 3 m synchro with partner Arturo Miranda, Despatie proved that he was one of the world&#x27;s best divers.

At the Beijing Olympics in 2008, he claimed a silver medal in the 3m springboard event and finished in 5th place in the 3m synchro event.

At the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Alexandre got 3 gold medals for Canada, in the 1 metre and 3 metre springboard, and 3 metre synchronized springboard dive.

==Television career==
Despatie announced his retirement during a news conference in Montreal on June 4, 2013. On June 6, he was announced as the cohost of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;&#x27;s Montreal edition, set to premiere on City Montreal on August 26, 2013.

In 2015, Despatie left the show, and was replaced by Derek Fage.

In 2021, Despatie appeared on &quot;Chanteurs masqués&quot;, a Quebecois version of the popular TV show &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. He appeared as &quot;Gâteau&quot; (Cake) and placed 8th overall.

In 2023, Despatie competed on &quot;Big Brother Célébrités&quot;. He is the 4th person evicted and lasts 29 days.

==Honors==
In 2018, Despatie was awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==

Despatie attended Collège André-Grasset. In an interview with the CBC in the lead-up to the 2004 Olympics, he said he was interested in acting and television/movie production, and may pursue that as a career once he is no longer diving, although he is also known to support groups and aspiring divers and to help them fulfill their dreams through private contributions to youth diving leagues. He has held diving clinics which aim to give young divers lessons and valuable experience.

In August 2006, Despatie started shooting his first feature film in Montreal. The movie, a teenage romantic comedy called &quot;Taking the Plunge (À vos marques... party!)&quot; was released in Quebec in March 2007. Despatie played a small but important part of a diver who is the friend and confidant of a young female swimmer. Quebec actress Louise Laparé coached Despatie for his role and told a Montreal newspaper that the popular athlete was a &quot;born actor&quot;.

He has since moved towards a career in broadcasting, joining the broadcast team for Canada&#x27;s French-language television coverage of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver during a brief break from training for the 2012 Games. He co-anchored the coverage of the opening and closing ceremonies alongside legendary Quebec hockey commentators Richard Garneau and Pierre Houde, narrated numerous athlete profiles, and took viewers on a tour of Granville Island, where many francophone musicians performed during the Olympics.

<doc id="901240" wikidata="Q5570686" url="?curid=901240" title="Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Program">
<text>The Global Temperature and Salinity Profile Programme (GTSPP) is a cooperative international project that seeks to develop and maintain a global ocean Temperature-Salinity resource with up-to-date and high quality data.

==Purpose==

Making global measurements of ocean temperature and salinity (T-S) quickly and easily accessible to users is the primary goal of the GTSPP. Both real time data transmitted over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), and delayed-mode data received by NCEI are acquired and incorporated into a continuously managed database.

==International contributors==

Several countries contribute to the GTSPP. They are:
* Australia
* Canada
* France
* Germany
* Japan
* Russia
* United States

Canada&#x27;s Marine Environmental Data Service (MEDS) leads the project, and has the operational responsibility to gather and process the real-time data. MEDS accumulates real-time data from several sources via the GTS. They check the data for several types of errors, and remove duplicate copies of the same observation before passing the data on to NCEI. The quality control procedures used in GTSPP were developed by MEDS, who also coordinated the publication of those procedures through the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). 

NOAA&#x27;s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) performs four functions for the GTSPP:

# Maintains the global database of temperature and salinity data and provides online access to the data.
# Adds real-time data supplied by MEDS to the database.
# Processes delayed mode copies of data by performing the same data quality tests as MEDS, then adds data to the database.
# Prepares monthly data sets and transfers them by network to participants in the U.S., Australia and France, as well as to requestors.

In addition to MEDS and NCEI, three science centers participate in the project by independently evaluating the delayed-mode data sets for the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and NOAA&#x27;s Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) perform this function as Data Assembly Centers for the World Ocean Circulation Program, which the GTSPP supports.

==Infrastructure==
The GTSPP consists of four major components:

* Global Telecommunication System (GTS): Carries real-time data from ships and buoys in support of the IOC/WMO Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS).
* IODE Data Centers: Contribute data, monitor the project, and distribute products. These are national oceanographic data centers which participate in the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) System of the International Oceanographic Commission.
* Continuously Managed Database (CMD): Maintains the up-to-date global temperature-salinity data, replaces near real-time records with higher quality delayed-mode records as they are received, and disseminates the data to users.
* WOCE Data Assembly Centers: Perform scientific quality control through data analysis, and issues products and predictions based on the global temperature-salinity data set.

==GTSPP documents==
* GTSPP Real-time Quality Control Manual (IOC Manuals and Guides #22) 
* AOML Manual 
* CSIRO &quot;Cookbook&quot; 
* Data Quality Flags 
* QC Intercomparison

<doc id="901243" wikidata="Q1680136" url="?curid=901243" title="John Randle">
<text>John Anthony Randle (born December 12, 1967) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for eleven seasons for the Minnesota Vikings and three seasons for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He was a six-time first-team All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler. Since becoming an official stat in 1982, his 137.5 sacks rank tenth, tied with Richard Dent, and first among defensive tackles. On February 6, 2010, he was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
He played college football for the Trinity Valley Cardinals and the Texas A&amp;I Javelinas, and was signed by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent after the 1990 NFL draft. He is considered one of the greatest undrafted players of all time.

==Early life and college==
Born in Mumford, Texas, Randle was raised in poverty and worked odd jobs when he was young. His brother Ervin played as a linebacker in the NFL for eight years. Randle played high school football in Hearne, Texas. He started his college playing career at Trinity Valley Community College, before transferring to Texas A&amp;M University–Kingsville.

==Professional career==
===Minnesota Vikings===
Randle went undrafted; he tried out for his brother&#x27;s team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but at 6&#x27;1&quot; and 244 pounds was thought to be too small, and was not signed to a contract. The Vikings picked up Randle after the draft on Head Scout Don Deisch&#x27;s recommendation. They told Randle he would be picked up only if he came back with his weight over 250, so when he was weighed in he hid a chain under his sweats.

Randle played his first season in 1990. He went to his first Pro Bowl in 1993 after recording 11.5 sacks, and quickly became one of his era&#x27;s dominant defensive tackles. Once Henry Thomas left the Vikings, Randle increased his training regimen. He recorded double-digit sacks during nine different seasons, including a career-high and league-leading 15.5 in 1997. In a 1999 game against the 49ers, he recorded his only career interception.

Like fellow Minnesota Viking Chris Hovan, Randle was known for eccentric face painting as well as trash-talking on the field, and disarming on-field heckling of opposing players. Among Randle&#x27;s most famous on-field catchphrases was &quot;Six footers for LIFE!&quot;, an allusion to scouting criticism of being undersized for his position.

Randle had an ongoing rivalry with Packers quarterback Brett Favre, whom he sacked more than any other quarterback; Favre said that Randle was the toughest defensive player he faced and that &quot;on artificial turf he&#x27;s unblockable&quot;. To play off the rivalry with Favre, Randle starred in a commercial featuring him sewing a miniature version of Favre&#x27;s #4 jersey, which he put on a live chicken. The commercial then showed Randle chasing the chicken around what was supposed to be Randle&#x27;s backyard and ended with him grilling chicken, leading to fierce protests by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Randle&#x27;s pass-rushing techniques were motion-captured for 989 Sports&#x27;s NFL Xtreme series. He was the cover athlete for the second game in the series.

===Seattle Seahawks===
At the end of the 2000 season, Randle signed with the Seattle Seahawks. In his first season with the Seahawks, he earned an invite to the Pro Bowl, the last of his career. Randle retired in 2004. He had planned to retire in 2003, but Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren convinced him to stay one more year. The Seahawks made the playoffs in 2003 while he was on the roster, but did not reach the Super Bowl, losing in the Wild Card Round to the Packers. Randle also acquired his final sack in 2003.

Randle left the NFL tied with Richard Dent for fifth in career sacks. His 137.5 sacks remain the second-highest total by a defensive tackle in NFL history, below fellow Vikings legend Alan Page, who had 148.5. Over his career, he was named to seven Pro Bowl squads. He was named All Tackle Machine of 1999 by &quot;Tackle: The Magazine&quot;.

After retiring, Holmgren said of Randle, &quot;He has more fun than any 10 players I&#x27;ve ever seen. There&#x27;s the John Randle football player and there&#x27;s the John Randle that might come up to my office and we&#x27;ll talk about something. There really are two distinctly different guys, and sometimes in this business you get to see that. For a coach, he just makes things worth it.&quot;

He was also inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame that year and had his number retired by his former high school team. In 2019, Randle was inducted into the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame. He lives in Medina, Minnesota, with his wife and children.

Randle served as a Minnesota delegate to the 2024 Democratic National Convention.
