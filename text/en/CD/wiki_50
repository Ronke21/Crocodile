<text>Hambledon Hill is a prehistoric hill fort in Dorset, England, in the Blackmore Vale five miles northwest of Blandford Forum. The hill itself is a chalk outcrop, on the southwestern corner of Cranborne Chase, separated from the Dorset Downs by the River Stour. It is owned by the National Trust.

==Prehistory==

Its earliest occupation was in the Neolithic when a pair of causewayed enclosures were dug at the top of the hill, one smaller than the other. They were linked by a bank and ditch running northwest–southeast. Two long barrows, one in length, also stood within the complex and a third enclosure is now known to underlie later earthworks. In all, the area of activity covered more than .

Excavations in the 1970s and 1980s by Roger Mercer produced large quantities of Neolithic material. Environmental analysis indicated the site was occupied whilst the area was still wooded with forest clearances coming later, in the Bronze Age. The charcoal recovered seems to have come from timber lacing within the Neolithic earthworks.

Radiocarbon analysis gives a date of 2850 BC. At least one skeleton, of a young man killed by an arrow was found, seemingly connected with the burning of the timber defences and suggesting at least one phase of violence. A single grape pip and a leaf fragment is evidence of vine cultivation and the occupants seem to have traded with sites further to the southwest.

The ditches of the enclosures also contained significant quantities of pottery as well as red deer antler picks used to excavate them. Human skulls had been placed right at the bottom of one of the enclosure ditches possibly as a dedicatory or ancestral offering. Animal bone analysis suggests that most of the meat was consumed in late summer and early autumn, possibly indicating seasonal use of the site. Different material was found in different areas of the site suggesting that Hambledon Hill was divided up into zones of activity. The original interpretation was that the large causewayed enclosure was used as a mortuary enclosure for the ritual disposal of the dead and veneration of the ancestors with attendant feasting and social contact taking place in the smaller enclosure.

Little remains of the Neolithic activity and the site is more easily identified as a prime example of an Iron Age hill fort. It was originally univallate but further circuits of banks and ditches were added increasing its size to . Three entrances served the fort, the southwestern with a long hornwork surrounding it. Hut platforms can be seen on the hillside. The site appears to have been abandoned around 300 BC possibly in favour of the nearby site of Hod Hill.

Hambledon Hill is the first in a series of Iron Age earthworks, which continues with Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final Iron Age monument in this small chain of sites.

==Battle of Hambledon Hill==
The Clubmen were a third force in the English Civil War, aligned to neither crown nor parliament, but striving to protect their land from being despoiled by foraging troops of either side. They armed themselves with clubs and agricultural implements and gathered in large numbers to protect their fields, especially in Dorset. Between 2,000 and 4,000 of them encamped on Hambledon Hill in August 1645. There were large numbers of Cromwell&#x27;s troops in the area at that time, after the siege of Sherborne Castle. Cromwell ordered that the Clubmen be dispersed and his well-equipped New Model Army soon drove them away on 4 August. The leaders were arrested but Cromwell sent most home saying they were &#x27;poor silly creatures&#x27;.

In September 1876, author Thomas Hardy visited the hill fort returning to his cottage in Sturminster Newton and almost got lost in the evening twilight: 

==Protected status==
The hill is now a National Nature Reserve (NNR) with common plants including milkwort, salad burnet, horseshoe vetch, squinancywort, pyramidal orchid and wild thyme. Rarer species include bastard toadflax, meadow saxifrage, early gentian and dwarf sedge. Butterflies include dingy skipper, grizzled skipper, chalkhill blue and Adonis blue.

In August 2014, Hambledon Hill fort was acquired by the National Trust for £450,000. The money to buy the hill had come from a Natural England grant and a legacy gift left to benefit Dorset countryside. The hillfort is a Scheduled Monument, as is the adjacent Neolithic causewayed camp.

Singer-songwriter Gordon Haskell wrote a song about Hambledon Hill for his album &quot;Hambledon Hill&quot; in 1990.

<text>A wheel clamp, also known as wheel boot, parking boot, or Denver boot, is a device that is designed to prevent motor vehicles from being moved. In its most common form, it consists of a clamp that surrounds a vehicle wheel, designed to prevent removal of both itself and the wheel.

In the United States, the device became known as a &quot;Denver boot&quot; after the city of Denver, Colorado, which was the first place in the country to employ them, mostly to force the payment of outstanding parking tickets.

While primarily associated with law enforcement and parking violations, a variety of wheel clamps are now available to consumers as theft deterrent devices for personal use as an alternative to the steering-wheel lock.

==Functions==

Wheel clamps have five main functions:
* To punish unauthorised or illegal parking, in lieu of towing the offending vehicle; in these cases, police or property owners who place the clamp may charge a high &quot;release fee&quot; to remove it
* To enforce unpaid fines previously applied to the vehicle; a certain number of nonpayments or time elapsed from the issuance of the most recent fine results in clamping upon the next violation
* To prevent driving by a suspended driver or moving of a disabled vehicle
* To preclude escape of a prosecuted person
* For security purposes, such as preventing a car, trailer, or caravan from being driven or towed away by a thief

==History==
As the automobile was introduced and became popular, cars also became a target for thieves and for a new concept that became known as joyriding. A variety of after-market security devices were introduced. An early invention were locking wheel clamps or chocks that owners could shackle onto one of the car&#x27;s road wheels as a hobble, making it impossible to roll the vehicle unless the entire wheel was removed. Between 1914 and 1925 there were at least 25 patents related to wheel locks that attached on the tire and spoke wheel. These devices were available in many sizes from a number of manufacturers (including several patented by Miller-Chapman), and became popular during the early 1920s.

A version of the modern wheel clamp, originally known as the auto immobiliser, was invented in 1944 and patented in 1958 by Frank Marugg. Marugg was a pattern maker, a violinist with the Denver Symphony Orchestra, and a friend of many Denver politicians and police department officials. The police department needed a solution to a growing parking enforcement problem. The city towed ticketed cars to the pound, where they were often vandalised. Those whose cars were damaged sued the city for losses and the police had to itemize everything in the cars. Dan Stills, head of the city&#x27;s traffic division, thought an immobilizer would avoid the expensive towing problem and approached Marugg with an idea to improve on the device to keep the cars where they were parked.

The Denver police first used the wheel boot on 5 January 1955 and collected over US$18,000 (US$ in dollars) in its first month of use. Although the wheel boot was first cast in steel, Marugg soon switched to a lighter aluminum-based alloy. Marugg later sold the device to parking lot owners, hotels and ski resorts, as well as a Jumbo version for farm equipment and larger vehicles. The Smithsonian Institution now has a copy of Marugg&#x27;s boot on display in Washington, D.C. By 1970 Marugg had sold 2,000 boots. Although the patent ran out in 1976 and modern car and truck wheels necessitated a redesign, Marugg&#x27;s daughter kept up the business until 1986. Clancy Systems International later bought the rights to the boot. The boot allowed Denver to maintain one of the largest collection rates for parking fines of any city in the US through its first fifty years. The Denver Sheriff ran the &quot;Boot Trucks&quot; for many years until the detail was transferred to Denver Parking Management. 

The best known wheel clamp in the UK is the &#x27;London Wheel Clamp&#x27;. The designer, Trevor Whitehouse filed the patent in 1991. He originally called the device the &#x27;Preston&#x27;, after his home town in Lancashire. Primarily used on private land, its notoriety grew once it was introduced to public roads under the Road Traffic Regulations Act of 1991 (commonly known as the de-criminalising of the yellow lines act). The first areas in the country to be decriminalised were the 33 London Boroughs during 1993/94, hence the name change.

==Controversy==

Wheel-clamping is notoriously unpopular with unauthorised parkers. While a traffic warden or police officer has jurisdiction over public roads, in many countries, the law allows landowners to clamp vehicles parking on their property without permission.

One British man became so annoyed at having his car clamped that he removed the clamp with an angle grinder. He subsequently received publicity as a self-styled &quot;superhero&quot; called &quot;Angle-Grinder Man&quot;, offering to remove clamps for free with his angle grinder.

Other motorists have cut the clamps off with bolt cutters or even clamping their own cars beforehand so that property owners will be unable to clamp an already-clamped vehicle and may think that another owner has clamped it. However, the practice of removing clamps is usually only done for those that were installed by private parties; the removal of clamps installed by authorities (chiefly the police) is an offence.

A New Zealand wheel clamper made national headlines in 2013 after he secretly recorded a police officer allegedly threatening to not help if an aggrieved member of the public attacked him. It was not the first time the clamper involved had been in the news.

There was a 2017/18 illegal boot operation around Los Angeles where a scammer booted unsuspecting drivers and demanded a high release fee. People were instructed to call 911 and report the scam if they fell victim. It has since ceased, and the scammer was arrested.

==Legal issues==

===United Kingdom===

In Scotland, local authorities are permitted by statute to clamp, tow, or otherwise remove vehicles. Outside that statutory authority, clamping on private land was found to be unlawful in the case &quot;Black v Carmichael&quot; (1992) SCCR 709, which held that immobilising a vehicle constitutes extortion and theft. Writing in dismissal of parking contractor Alan Black&#x27;s appeal to the High Court of Justiciary, the Lord Justice General (Lord Hope) cited case law which said &quot;every man has a right to dispute the demand of his creditor in a court of justice&quot; and himself wrote &quot;it is illegal for vehicles to be held to ransom in the manner described in these charges&quot;.

In England and Wales, The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 criminalised certain wheel-clamping activity on private land without lawful authority from 1 October 2012. This prohibits clamping in many common locations such as supermarket car parks, but clamping is not entirely banned. For example, a railway operator may clamp a vehicle under the provisions of Railway Byelaw 14(4). The act of clamping is still lawful by the police, DVLA, local authority, etc. but not by a private person or company acting on behalf of their own interests on either public or private property. For example, a person cannot lawfully be clamped on property such as a hospital site, private driveway, car park not operated by a local or government authority, etc. The only exception to this is if the clamping company are acting on behalf of a government agency e.g. contracted on behalf of the DVLA. To allow landowners to deal with unauthorised vehicles the same statute allows land owners to hold the registered keeper of a vehicle liable for any charges relating to breach of contract under certain circumstances. Landowners who seek to enforce &#x27;Parking Charge Notices&#x27; (contractual payment terms) establish the contract through the use of onsite signage detailing the &#x27;conditions&#x27;.

===Ireland===

In the Republic of Ireland, clamping in public places is legal under a 1988 amendment to the Road Traffic Act 1961. Clamping in private car parks is widespread but not regulated by statute, and the legality of the practice is unclear. The breaches for which an &quot;immobilisation device&quot; may be fitted under the 1961 act are those specified in sections 35, 36, and 36A of the Road Traffic Act 1994 as amended (respectively &quot;Regulations for general control of traffic and pedestrians&quot;, &quot;Parking of vehicles in parking places on public roads&quot;, and &quot;Bye-laws for restriction on parking – specified events&quot;). Regulations under the 1994 act are made by statutory instrument by the minister responsible for transport (currently the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport). Local authorities have delegated the clamping activity to private companies. This contrasts with traffic wardens, who are employees of the authority.

Existing statutory provisions are due to be replaced by the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015, passed as part of the Fine Gael–Labour coalition&#x27;s 2011 programme for government. The 2015 act regulates private as well as public clamping. It also seeks to improve and standardise the level of fines and the appeals process, which have been the focus of public dissatisfaction.

<text>Blueprint 76 was an American pop punk band started in 2002 by Royce Nunley after eight years in The Suicide Machines. The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Nunley on lead vocals and bass, Steve Toth on guitar and Joe Reilly on drums. Joe Reilly &quot;Joey Danger&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Joey B-Side&quot; moved back to his hometown of Nashville to drum tech for The Pink Spiders who had just been signed to Geffen Records and was filled in by &quot;Porno Bob&quot; for the final tour and Warped Tour dates. Blueprint also lost member Steve Toth and added &quot;Jon Berz&quot; on guitar who also fronts &quot;The Cast, The Camera&quot; and is a multi-instrumentalist for Blasé Splee. Blueprint added Dan Powers as the new bassist and Royce finished out their last years as lead singer.

<text>The Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea or Duklja (; ) is the usual name given to a medieval chronicle written in two versions between 1295 and 1301 by an ecclesiastic from Duklja, recently identified as Rudger, Archbishop of Bar. Its oldest preserved copy is in Latin from the 17th century, and modern historians have debated the text&#x27;s date of composition (mid-12th to late 16th century) and authenticity. 

It contains some material on the early history of the Western South Slavs. Historians have yet to discount the work as based on inaccuracies and fiction. The postulates are there that Slavs lived in the Balkans from the 5th- to the 12th-century. It recounts the history of Dalmatia and nearby regions from the 5th to the mid-12th century. The section &quot;Life of St. Jovan Vladimir&quot;, is believed to be one of the local traditions integrated into the narrative.

==Authorship and date==

The work was traditionally ascribed to an anonymous &quot;priest of Duklja&quot; (&quot;presbyter Diocleas&quot;, known in Serbo-Croatian as &quot;pop Dukljanin&quot;). The work is preserved only in its Latin redactions from a 17th-century printing. Dmine Papalić, a nobleman from Split, found the text which he transcribed in 1509–10, which was translated by Marko Marulić into Latin in 1510, with the title &quot;Regnum Dalmatiae et Croatiae gesta&quot;. Mavro Orbin, a Ragusan historian, included the work (amongst other works) in his &quot;Il regno de gli Slavi&quot; (ca. 1601); Johannes Lucius did the same in ca. 1666. These Latin redactions claim that the original was written in Slavic.

According to its recent editor, Tibor Živković, the chronicle, written in Latin, was completed in two versions between 1295 and 1301 in the towns of Split, then part of the Kingdom of Croatia in personal union with Hungary, and Bar (in Montenegro), then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was &quot;presbyter&quot; Rudger (or Rüdiger), the Catholic Archbishop of Bar (&quot;Antivari&quot;), who was probably of Czech origin. He is thought to have written around 1300 because Bosnian borders are referred to in a way that coincides with an anonymous text, the &quot;Anonymi Descriptio Europae Orientalis&quot;, that has been dated to the year 1308. Rudger became Archbishop of Bar in 1298, but was expelled from the town in 1301 by order of the Serbian king Stefan Uroš II Milutin; Rudger died at the monastery of Zwettl, in Austria, in on 8 December 1305. On the basis of its content, Rudger&#x27;s composition is believed to have been heavily influenced by his knowledge of medieval Latin sources, from Isidore of Seville and Jordanes to Peter Abelard and Geoffrey of Monmouth and Bohemian and Polish historical works. The themes and scope of Rudger&#x27;s work are supposed to have been shaped by the political interests and priorities of his patron, Paul I Šubić of Bribir, Ban of Croatia and Lord of Bosnia. 

Chapters 1–33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author&#x27;s constructions; these are largely dismissed by historians. However, the next three chapters possess invaluable historical data about this time period. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 (on Saint Jovan Vladimir), a summary of an older hagiography dating between 1075 and 1089 (when the Vojislavljević dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric), contains considerable historical data that has been found to be reliable. Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir&#x27;s father and uncles, are likely based on the prologue of this 11th-century hagiography.

Other obsolete and refuted theories include that the author lived in the second half of the 12th century. Some Croatian historians put forward the theory, of E. Peričić (1991), that the anonymous author was a &quot;Grgur Barski&quot; (Gregory of Bar), a bishop of Bar, who lived in the second half of the 12th century. The bishopric of Bar was defunct at that time. In his 1967 reprint of the work, Yugoslav historian Slavko Mijušković said that the chronicle is a purely fictional literary product, belonging to the late 14th or early 15th century. Serbian historian Tibor Živković, in his monograph &quot;Gesta regum Sclavorum&quot; (2009), concluded that its main parts are dated to ca. 1295–1301.

==Content==
&quot;Regnum Sclavorum&quot; (1601) can be divided into the following sections:
* Introduction (&quot;Auctor ad lectorem&quot;)
* &quot;Libellus Gothorum&quot;, chapters I–VII
* Constantine&#x27;s Legend (or &quot;Pannonian Legend&quot;), chapters VIII and beginning of IX
* Methodius (&quot;Liber sclavorum qui dicitur Methodius&quot;), rest of chapter IX
* Travunian Chronicle, chapters X–XXXV, in two parts
* The Life of St. Jovan Vladimir, chapter XXXVI
* History of Dioclea, chapters XXXVII–LXVII

The author attempted to present an overview of ruling families over the course of over two centuries — from the 10th century up to the time of writing, the 12th century. There are 47 chapters in the text, of different sizes and varying subject matter.

==Folklore and translations==
The work is actually a number of separate but similar manuscripts, stemming from an original source that does not survive but assumed to have been written by the Priest of Duklja himself (or other monk-scribes giving a helping hand).

It has been generally agreed that this Presbyter included in his work folklore and literary material from Slavic sources which he translated into Latin. Among the material he translated, rather than created, is &quot;The Legend of Prince Vladimir&quot; which is supposed to have been written by another clergyman, also from Duklja, more specifically, Zećanin from Krajina in Zeta or Duklja (an earlier name for Zeta). In its original version, it was a hagiographic work, a &quot;Life of St. Vladimir&quot; rather than a &quot;Legend.&quot; Prince Vladimir, the protagonist of the story, as well as Emperor Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria, who ordered Vladimir&#x27;s execution, were historical persons, yet &quot;The Legend of Prince Vladimir&quot; is believed to contain non-historical material.

The chronicle was also added to by a bishop of Bar intent on demonstrating his diocese&#x27; superiority over that of Bishop of Split.

In 1986, the chronicle was translated from the Croatian into Ukrainian by Antin V. Iwachniuk. The translation was financed by the Iwachniuk Ukrainian Studies and Research Fund at the University of Ottawa.

==Assessment==

===Historical value, fiction===
Various inaccurate or simply wrong claims in the text make it an unreliable source. Modern historians have serious doubts about the majority of this work as being mainly fictional, or wishful thinking. Some go as far as to say that it can be dismissed in its entirety, but that is not a majority opinion, rather, it is thought to have given us a unique insight into the whole era from the point of view of the indigenous Slavic population and it is still a topic of discussion.

The work describes the local Slavs as a peaceful people imported by the Goth rulers, who invaded the area in the 5th century, but it doesn&#x27;t attempt to elaborate on how and when this happened. This information contradicts the information found in the Byzantine text &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; also mentions one Svetopeleg or Svetopelek, the eighth descendant of the original Goth invaders, as the main ruler of the lands that cover Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro (Duklja) and Serbia. He is also credited with the Christianization of the people who are Goths or Slavs — a purely fictitious attribution. These claims about a unified kingdom are probably a reflection of the earlier glory of the Moravian kingdom. He may also have been talking about Avars.

The priest&#x27;s parish was located at the seat of the archbishopric of Duklja. According to Bishop Gregory&#x27;s late 12th-century additions to this document, this Archbishopric covered much of the western Balkans including the bishoprics of Bar, Budva, Kotor, Ulcinj, Svač, Skadar, Drivast, Pulat, Travunia, Zahumlje.
Further, it mentions Bosnia (Bosnam) and Rascia (Rassa) as the two lands of &quot;Transmontana&quot;/&quot;Surbia&quot;, while describing the southern Dalmatian Hum/&quot;Zahumlje&quot;, Travunia and Dioclea (most of today&#x27;s Herzegovina, Montenegro, as well as parts of Croatia and Albania) as &quot;Maritima&quot;/&quot;Croatian&quot; lands of Red Croatia while other Dalmatian-Lika lands as White Croatia, which is a description inconsistent with other historical works from the same period, but not all.

The archbishop of Bar was later named &quot;Primas Serbiae&quot;. Ragusa had some claims to be considered the natural ecclesiastical centre of South Dalmatia but those of Dioclea (Bar) to this new metropolitan status were now vigorously pushed especially as the Pope intended Serbia to be attached to Dioclea.

In his 1967 reprint of the work, Yugoslav historian Slavko Mijušković stated that the chronicle is a purely fictional literary product, belonging to the late 14th or early 15th century.

===Region of Bosnia===
The region of Bosnia is described to span the area west of the river Drina, &quot;up to the Pine mountain&quot; (, ). The location of this Pine mountain is unknown.
In 1881, Croatian historian Franjo Rački wrote that this refers to the mountain of &quot;Borova glava&quot; near the Livno field.
Croatian historian Luka Jelić wrote the mountain was located either between Maglaj and Skender Vakuf, northwest of Žepče, or it was the mountain Borovina located between Vranica and Radovna, according to Ferdo Šišić&#x27;s 1908 work.
In 1935, Serbian historian Vladimir Ćorović wrote that the toponym refers to the mountain of Borova glava, because of etymology and because it is located on the watershed (drainage divide).
In 1936, Slovene ethnologist Niko Županič had also interpreted that to mean that the western border of Bosnia was at some drainage divide mountains, but placed it to the southeast of Dinara.
Croatian historian Anto Babić, based on the work of Dominik Mandić in 1978, inferred that the term refers roughly to a place of the drainage divide between the Sava and Adriatic Sea watersheds.
In her discussion of Ćorović, Serbian historian Jelena Mrgić-Radojčić also points to the existence of a mountain of &quot;Borja&quot; in today&#x27;s northern Bosnia with the same etymology.

<doc id="888694" wikidata="Q1407263" url="?curid=888694" title="Forensic psychiatry">
<text>Forensic psychiatry is a subspeciality of psychiatry and is related to criminology. It encompasses the interface between law and psychiatry. According to the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, it is defined as &quot;a subspecialty of psychiatry in which scientific and clinical expertise is applied in legal contexts involving civil, criminal, correctional, regulatory, or legislative matters, and in specialized clinical consultations in areas such as risk assessment or employment.&quot; A forensic psychiatrist provides services – such as determination of competency to stand trial – to a court of law to facilitate the adjudicative process and provide treatment, such as medications and psychotherapy, to criminals.

==Court work==

Forensic psychiatrists work with courts in evaluating an individual&#x27;s competency to stand trial, defenses based on mental disorders (e.g., the insanity defense), and sentencing recommendations. The two major areas of criminal evaluations in forensic psychiatry are competency to stand trial (CST) and mental state at the time of the offense (MSO).

===Competency to stand trial===

Competency to stand trial (CST) is the competency evaluation to determine that defendants have the mental capacity to understand the charges and assist their attorneys. In the United States, this is seated in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which ensures the right to be present at one&#x27;s trial, to face one&#x27;s accusers, and to have help from an attorney. CST, sometimes referred to as adjudicative competency, serves three purposes: &quot;preserving the dignity of the criminal process, reducing the risk of erroneous convictions, and protecting defendants&#x27; decision-making autonomy&quot;.

In 1960, the Supreme Court of the United States in Dusky v. United States established the standard for federal courts, ruling that &quot;the test must be whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and a rational as well as factual understanding of proceedings against him.&quot; The evaluations must assess a defendant&#x27;s ability to assist their legal counsel, meaning that they understand the legal charges against them, the implications of being a defendant, and the adversarial nature of the proceedings, including the roles played by defense counsel, prosecutors, judges, and the jury. They must be able to communicate relevant information to their attorney, and understand information provided by their attorney. Finally, they must be competent to make important decisions, such as whether or not to accept a plea agreement.

In England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, a similar legal concept is that of &quot;fitness to plead&quot;.

===As an expert witness===

Forensic psychiatrists are often called to be expert witnesses in both criminal and civil proceedings. Expert witnesses give their opinions about a specific issue. Often, the psychiatrist will have prepared a detailed report before testifying. The primary duty of the expert witness is to provide an independent opinion to the court. An expert is allowed to testify in court with respect to matters of opinion only when the matters in question are not ordinarily understandable to the finders of fact, be they judge or jury. As such, prominent leaders in the field of forensic psychiatry, from Thomas Gutheil to Robert Simon and Liza Gold and others have identified teaching as a critical dimension in the role of expert witness. The expert will be asked to form an opinion and to testify about that opinion, but in so doing will explain the basis for that opinion, which will include important concepts, approaches, and methods used in psychiatry.

===Mental state opinion===

Mental state opinion (MSO) gives the court an opinion, and only an opinion, as to whether a defendant was able to understand what he/she was doing at the time of the crime. This is worded differently in many states, and has been rejected altogether in some, but in every setting, the intent to do a criminal act and the understanding of the criminal nature of the act bear on the final disposition of the case. Much of forensic psychiatry is guided by significant court rulings or laws that bear on this area which include these three standards:

* M&#x27;Naghten rules: Excuses a defendant who, by virtue of a defect of reason or disease of the mind, does not know the nature and quality of the act, or, if he or she does, does not know that the act is indeed wrong.
* Durham rule: Excuses a defendant whose conduct is the product of mental disorder.
* ALI test: Excuses a defendant who, because of a mental disease or defect, lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his or her conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.

&quot;Not guilty by reason of insanity&quot; (NGRI) is one potential outcome in this type of trial. Importantly, insanity is a legal and not a medical term. Often, psychiatrists may be testifying for both the defense and the prosecution.

Forensic psychiatrists are also involved in the care of prisoners, both in jails and prisons, and in the care of the mentally ill who have committed criminal acts (such as those who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity).

== Forensic psychiatry vs psychology ==

=== Forensic psychiatry ===
Forensic psychiatrists focus on how biology applies to the legal system. They focus more on the scientific facts as well as diagnosing and treating mental disorders. They legally assess clients, provide a diagnosis, and can prescribe medication if necessary. They are licensed medical doctors (MD) that make roughly $190,000 annually.

=== Forensic psychology ===
Forensic psychologists examine how different disorders and conditions can apply in court. Their jobs typically entail working as research assistants and probation officers. They often determine trial competency, assess the risk of inmates, and aid in jury selection. Forensic psychologists can use information learned about mental health and criminal justice to advocate for those who are mentally ill. After earning a master&#x27;s and a PhD in psychology or a Doctor of Psychology, PsyD, they can become forensic psychologists. While they are required to be licensed by the state, they are not required to be medical doctors. This means that they cannot prescribe medication. Forensic psychologists make roughly $67,000 annually.

==Risk management==
Many past offenders against other people, and suspected or potential future offenders with mental health problems or an intellectual or developmental disability, are supervised in the community by forensic psychiatric teams made up of a variety of professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and care workers. These teams have dual responsibilities: to promote both the welfare of their clients and the safety of the public. The aim is not so much to predict as to prevent violence, by means of risk management.

Risk assessment and management is a growth area in the forensic field, with much Canadian academic work being done in Ontario and British Columbia. This began with the attempt to predict the likelihood of a particular kind of offense being repeated, by combining &quot;static&quot; indicators from personal history and offense details in actuarial instruments such as the RRASOR and Static-99, which were shown to be more accurate than unaided professional judgment. More recently, use is being made also of &quot;dynamic&quot; risk factors, such as attitudes, impulsivity, mental state, family and social circumstances, substance use, and the availability and acceptance of support, to make a &quot;structured professional judgment.&quot; The aim of this is to move away from prediction to prevention, by identifying and then managing risk factors. This may entail monitoring, treatment, rehabilitation, supervision, and victim safety planning and depends on the availability of funding and legal powers.

Risk management in forensic psychiatry is often done using standardised tests called structured professional judgement tools. Two such tools include the HCR-20 and the newer SAPROF developed in the late 2010s. These tools are used to measure the likelihood of recidivism and identify protective factors for offenders.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, most forensic psychiatrists work for the National Health Service, in specialist secure units caring for mentally ill offenders (as well as people whose behaviour has made them impossible to manage in other hospitals). These can be either medium secure units (of which there are many throughout the country) or high secure hospitals (also known as special hospitals), of which three are in England and one in Scotland (the State Hospital, Carstairs), the best known of which is Broadmoor Hospital. The other &#x27;specials&#x27; are Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Liverpool, and Rampton hospital in Nottinghamshire. Also, a number of private-sector medium secure units sell their beds exclusively to the NHS, as not enough secure beds are available in the NHS system.

Forensic psychiatrists often also do prison inreach work, in which they go into prisons and assess and treat people suspected of having mental disorders; much of the day-to-day work of these psychiatrists comprises care of very seriously mentally ill patients, especially those with schizophrenia. Some units also treat people with severe personality disorder or learning disabilities. The areas of assessment for courts are also somewhat different in Britain, because of differing mental health law. Fitness to plead and mental state at the time of the offence are indeed issues given consideration, but the mental state at the time of trial is also a major issue, and this assessment most commonly leads to the use of mental health legislation to detain people in hospitals, as opposed to their getting a prison sentence.

Learning-disabled offenders who are a continuing risk to others may be detained in learning-disability hospitals (or specialised community-based units with a similar regimen, as the hospitals have mostly been closed). This includes those who commit serious crimes of violence, including sexual violence, and fire-setting. They would be cared for by learning disability psychiatrists and registered learning disability nurses. Some psychiatrists doing this work have dual training in learning disability and forensic psychiatry or learning disability and adolescent psychiatry. Some nurses would have training in mental health, also.

Court work (medicolegal work) is generally undertaken as private work by psychiatrists (most often forensic psychiatrists), as well as forensic and clinical psychologists, who usually also work within the NHS. This work is generally funded by the Legal Services Commission (used to be called Legal Aid).

== United States ==
Forensic psychiatrists typically work with attorneys and judges. Their purpose is to mediate psychiatric-legal issues that require a more professional perspective. Their scope of practice also includes helping their clients improve their mental status. A few duties that are typically expected of a forensic psychiatrist include determining readiness for parole, conducting assessments to determine any mental issues, evaluating injuries and their effects on the client, and determining competency. All of these tasks have one thing in common: their main focus is on evaluating capacity and competence.

These workers play an important role in combating the phenomenon of &quot;double revolving doors&quot; between hospitals and prisons. Many mentally ill patients will rotate between hospitals and prisons because they are not getting the help they need. Legal decisions affecting psychiatric patients are not made lightly and require an in-depth analysis of anyone involved. Forensic psychiatrists have a background in both the medical aspect of psychiatry as well as the legal aspects of a courtroom. 

== Canada ==

===Criminal law framework===
Mental Health Acts specify the circumstances under which individuals may be brought against their will to a psychiatric facility for examination or assessment and possible admission. It can be initiated by a physician for psychiatric assessment of the person or examination of the person ordered by a judge, magistrate or justice of the peace 

Concerns have been expressed that the Canadian criminal justice system discriminates based on DSM IV diagnosis within the context of Part XX of the Criminal Code. This part sets out provisions for, among other things, court ordered attempts at &quot;treatment&quot; before individuals receive a trial as described in section 672.58 of the Criminal Code. Also provided for are court ordered &quot;psychiatric assessments&quot;. Critics have also expressed concerns that use of the DSM-IV-TR may conflict with section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the fundamental freedom of &quot;thought, belief, opinion, and expression&quot;.

===Confidentiality===
The position of the Canadian Psychiatric Association holds, &quot;in recent years, serious incursions have been made by governments, powerful commercial interests, law enforcement agencies, and the courts on the rights of persons to their privacy.&quot; It goes on to state, &quot;breaches or potential breaches of confidentiality in the context of therapy seriously jeopardize the quality of the information communicated between patient and psychiatrist and also compromise the mutual trust and confidence necessary for effective therapy to occur.&quot;

An outline of the forensic psychiatric process as it occurs in the province of Ontario is presented in the publication &quot;The Forensic Mental Health System In Ontario: An Information Guide&quot; published by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. The Guide states: &quot;Whatever you tell a forensic psychiatrist and the other professionals assessing you is not confidential.&quot; The Guide further states: &quot;The forensic psychiatrist will report to the court using any available information, such as: police and hospital records, information given by your friends, family or co-workers, observations of you in the hospital.&quot; Also according to the Guide: &quot;You have the right to refuse to take part in some or all of the assessment. Sometimes your friends or family members will be asked for information about you. They have the right to refuse to answer questions, too.&quot;

Of note, the emphasis in the guide is on the right to refuse participation. This may seem unusual given that a result of a verdict of &quot;Not Criminally Responsible by reason of Mental Disorder&quot; is often portrayed as desirable to the defence, similar to the insanity defense in the United States. A verdict of &quot;Not Criminally Responsible&quot; is referred to as a &quot;defence&quot; by the Criminal Code. However, the issue of the accused&#x27;s mental state can also be raised by the Crown or by the court itself, rather than solely by the defence counsel, differentiating it from many other legal defences.

===Treatment/assessment conflict===
In Ontario, a court-ordered inpatient forensic assessment for criminal responsibility typically involves both treatment and assessment being performed with the accused in the custody of a single multidisciplinary team over a 30- or 60-day period. Concerns have been expressed that an accused may feel compelled on ethical, medical, or legal grounds to divulge information, medical, or otherwise, to assessors in an attempt to allow for and ensure safe and appropriate treatment during that period of custody.

Some Internet references address treatment/assessment conflict as it relates to various justice systems, particularly civil litigation in other jurisdictions. The American Academy Of Psychiatry and the Law states in its ethics guidelines, &quot;when a treatment relationship exists, such as in correctional settings, the usual physician-patient duties apply&quot;, which may be seen as contradiction.

==South Africa==
In South Africa, patients are referred for observation for a period of 30 days by the courts if questions exist as to CST and MSO. Serious crimes require a panel, which may include two or more psychiatrists. Should the courts find the defendant not criminally responsible, the defendant may become a state patient and be admitted in a forensic psychiatric hospital.
They are referred to receive treatment for an indefinite period, but most were back in the community after three years.

== Educational requirements ==
A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who has completed undergraduate school, medical school, and residency training. Forensic psychiatrists typically have additional training that is relevant to the job they hold (such as a focus in child/adolescent, geriatric, or addiction). Many forensic psychiatrists will complete a more specific training after their residency in a related area. This training typically lasts another one or two years. Because they have earned a doctorate in medicine (MD), they are able to both diagnose and treat disorders related to their mental state. They are also able to prescribe medication.

==Training standards==
Some practitioners of forensic psychiatry have taken extra training in that specific area. In the United States, one-year fellowships are offered in this field to psychiatrists who have completed their general psychiatry training. Such psychiatrists may then be eligible to sit for a board certification examination in forensic psychiatry. In Britain, one is required to complete a three-year subspeciality training in forensic psychiatry, after completing one&#x27;s general psychiatry training, before receiving a Certificate of Completion of Training as a forensic psychiatrist. In some countries, general psychiatrists can practice forensic psychiatry, as well. However, other countries, such as Japan, require a specific certification from the government to do this type of work.

<doc id="888703" wikidata="Q5258318" url="?curid=888703" title="Dennis Crosby">
<text>Dennis Michael Crosby (July 13, 1934 – May 4, 1991) was an American singer and occasional actor, the son of singer and actor Bing Crosby and his first wife Dixie Lee, and twin brother of Phillip Crosby. He was the father of &quot;Star Trek TNG&quot; actress Denise Crosby, who was named after him.

== Early life ==
Dennis Crosby attended Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose with his other brothers where he graduated in 1952. He subsequently enrolled at Washington State University at Pullman on an animal husbandry course with his twin brother. He dropped out of the course after two years and was inducted into the Army in January 1955. He was initially posted to Fort Ord, California and then transferred to Fort Riley in Kansas for training with the US 10th Infantry Division, which transferred for duty in West Germany in the summer of 1955.

When he was 21 in 1955, Dennis inherited $200,000, , from his late mother&#x27;s trust.

== Career ==

In the late 1950s, Dennis and his brothers Gary, Lindsay, and Phillip often performed as the Crosby Brothers in nightclubs and on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, though Dennis reputedly wished to avoid such appearances.

== Personal life ==

On May 4, 1958, Crosby married Pat Sheehan, a Las Vegas showgirl and model who had once dated his father, shortly after his mother had died. She was Miss San Francisco of 1950, Playboy Playmate of the month of October 1958, and a part-time actress.

Within days, Crosby was sued by another woman, Marilyn Miller Scott, over the paternity of her daughter, Denise Crosby. The sensational lawsuit lasted three years, and ended with Dennis being ordered to pay Scott child support and legal fees. This and the marriage to Sheehan and other details caused deep embarrassment for both him and his father. Although Bing Crosby died when his granddaughter was 19, the two reportedly never met.

Crosby and Sheehan had two sons: Dennis Michael Jr and Patrick Anthony. He adopted Gregory Crosby, who was his wife&#x27;s son by a previous marriage. 

In 1963, while working in Los Angeles for Bing Crosby Productions, he met Arleen Newman. On July 3, 1964, Crosby and Sheehan were divorced. Later that year, Crosby married Newman. The couple had three daughters, including: Erin Colleen Crosby, born February 25, 1971, in Los Angeles, and Kelly Lee Crosby. Crosby adopted Newman&#x27;s daughter, Catherine Denise Crosby, from her first marriage to Mike Buell, which ended in divorce. Crosby and Newman divorced in 1991.

On December 11, 1989, Crosby&#x27;s younger brother Lindsay died by suicide by gunshot.

== Death ==
Deeply distraught by his brother Lindsay&#x27;s suicide and his own recent divorce, Crosby died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on May 4, 1991, in Novato, California, aged 56. On January 14, 2006, Crosby&#x27;s former wife, Pat Sheehan, died at the age of 74. 

Their son Dennis Michael Crosby Jr. died on January 15, 2010 of an overdose. Patrick Anthony Crosby, born New Year&#x27;s Eve 1960, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, on September 19, 2011, after a lengthy illness.

<text>Austin is one of 77 community areas in Chicago. Located on the city&#x27;s West Side, it is the third-largest community area by population (behind the Near North Side and Lake View) and the second-largest geographically (behind South Deering). Austin&#x27;s eastern boundary is the Belt Railway located just east of Cicero Avenue. Its northernmost border is the Milwaukee District / West Line. Its southernmost border is at Roosevelt Road from the Belt Railway west to Austin Boulevard. The northernmost portion, north of North Avenue, extends west to Harlem Avenue, abutting Elmwood Park. In addition to Elmwood Park, Austin also borders the suburbs of Cicero and Oak Park.

==History==
===Early development===
In 1835, Henry DeKoven purchased prairie land in the region. In 1857, a group of citizens formed the Town of Cicero, a ten-member local governing body that covered modern-day Cicero, Oak Park, Berwyn, and Austin. Eight years later, DeKoven&#x27;s land was bought by Henry W. Austin. Austin, a businessman and real estate speculator, developed the namesake Austinville subdivision. Its population grew exponentially as the area&#x27;s attractive amenities and access to suburban railroad service drew in population. In 1870, the Town of Cicero placed its town hall in Austin. However, by the 1890s, the heavily populated Austin area dominated town politics, but did not constitute a majority of voters. The Austin-controlled township government allowed the Lake Street Elevated to extend into Oak Park. Outraged, the other residents of Cicero Township voted to allow Chicago to annex the Austin area in an 1899 referendum. The residents of Austin voted against the referendum.

===Neighborhood growth===
After its annexation, Austin continued to maintain an independent, suburban identity. By the 1920s, the area had developed significant street railways to serve its commuter population. This infrastructure attracted a large group of European immigrants to the community. In 1926, the area had an etimated 140,000 residents. In 1923, Austin Hospital opened. In 1938, the hospital, now called William Temperance Hospital, was taken over by Sisters of Saint Casimir, who operated the hospital as Loretto Hospital.

In 1949, construction began on the Eisenhower Expressway, which bisected the southern portion of Austin.

===African-American migration, white flight, and economic decline===
After World War II, African Americans increasingly moved into the surrounding community areas of East Garfield Park, North Lawndale, and West Garfield Park. After the arrival of African Americans during the Great Migration, race-related prejudices such as a case of the White flight movement, with a dramatic decrease in White residents, White-owned businesses, equal city services support and resources, racially motivated realtor practices, and industrial jobs. By 1970, the Austin community was 32% Black. A decade later, it was 73% Black. These trends of a decline in city services and resources and jobs would continue for the rest of the 20th century with Austin.

The Austin community became known for violence after the loss of free-flowing capital during white flight when prostitution, drug dealing, gang activity, and shoot-outs became commonplace in the Austin neighborhood. Many trace the problems that impacted this community to the crack cocaine epidemic, as well as the opioid crisis, mass incarceration, and the HIV epidemic, which resulted in further economic decline and the loss of many social safety nets. This led to many middle- and upper middle-class African Americans leaving for the suburbs. In 1992, the 15th District (Austin) of the Chicago Police Department located at 5327 West Chicago Avenue at the time recorded about 48 homicides, which covers most of the Austin neighborhood, making the Austin District the fourth-deadliest police district at the time, before the 11th District (Harrison), which had 93 homicides, 7th District (Englewood), which had 80 homicides, and the 2nd District (Wentworth), which had 69 homicides.

The latter half of the 20th century saw significant divestment from the community. The Central station of the Chicago Transportation Agency&#x27;s Congress Line was closed on September 2, 1973. In 1988, West Side Health Authority was formed after the closure of St. Anne&#x27;s Hospital. In 1991, the Sisters of Saint Casimir gave control of Loretto Hospital to a management company.

In 1999, developers agreed to turn the abandoned Galewood railyard into an industrial park.
During the development of the property, then-Alderman Ike Carothers solicited a bribe to allow the permitting process and zoning changes to move forward. The subsequent trials created a political scandal, and ended with the conviction of the developer and Carothers on various felony charges. The $60 million development ultimately brought new homes and a movie theater to the neighborhood.

==Neighborhoods==

Austin is Chicago&#x27;s second-largest community area both by population and by land area. The Austin community area is made up of four neighborhoods: Galewood, The Island, North Austin, and South Austin.

===Galewood===
Galewood is named for Abram Gale, who bought a farm on the area in 1838. The neighborhood is bordered by the Milwaukee District / West Line to the north, Harlem Avenue to the west, North Avenue to the south, and Narragansett Avenue to the east. The area is a historically Italian-American community with a sizable population of Chicago city employees. Since the 1980s, it has seen an increase in African-American and Latino residents, but this integration has occurred peacefully in contrast with other areas of Chicago.

Galewood has two stations on the Milwaukee District West Line. The first, Mars station functions as a stop for employees of the nearby Mars, Incorporated factory, closing in 2024, and Shriners Hospitals for Children, the latter of which is located in Montclare. The Mars station only stops during traditional commuting hours. The second, Galewood station is located east of Mars station and is a regular service station. Canadian Pacific (which operates in the U.S. Midwest as the Soo Line Railroad) operates freight trains on the line via trackage rights.

The neighborhood has strong ties with neighboring Montclare, including sharing a namesake library in the Chicago Public Library system, and is sometimes considered as part of that neighborhood and not the Austin community.

Galewood is significantly whiter than the remainder of Austin. Galewood is 22.51% White, 50.17% African American, and 1.77% from two or more races. Residents who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino of any race were 23.96% of the total Galewood population, with the western half of Galewood being 36% White and 31% African American.

===The Island===
The Island neighborhood is located in the southwest corner of the Austin community. It has a population around 1,700 residents. It encompasses roughly a square mile and its western and southern borders are to the suburbs of Oak Park and Cicero, respectively. It is further isolated from the rest of Austin by an industrial corridor to its east and railroad tracks and Interstate 290 to the north. It is only accessible from Austin Boulevard and Roosevelt Road.

The Island was the last of Austin&#x27;s neighborhoods to integrate. In the 1980s, when the rest of Austin was over 70% African American, The Island did not have a single African-American family. In 1984, when an African-American family attempted to move in on Roosevelt Road, they were met with violent resistance and shortly moved out. Politically, the area went heavily for Jane Byrne in the Democratic primary and for Edward Vrdolyak against Harold Washington in the 1987 mayoral election that broke down on racial lines. Today, The Island is an integrated community.

The area, once industrial, has a diverse economy. Chicago Studio City, the largest film studio in the Midwestern United States, is located here. The films &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, and &quot;Public Enemies&quot; were partially filmed in The Island, as were episodes of &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Shameless&quot;.

=== North Austin ===
One of Austin&#x27;s neighborhoods is North Austin; its boundaries start north at Milwaukee District/West Line and Armitage Avenue, western boundaries are Austin Avenue or Austin Boulevard south of North Avenue, eastern boundaries to Cicero Avenue, and southern boundaries to Division Street. The Robert LeFlore Jr. Post Office at 5001 West Division Street is in this neighborhood.

=== South Austin ===
South Austin is the area&#x27;s largest neighborhood. It is bordered by Division Street to the north, Austin Boulevard to the west, Roosevelt Road to the south, and Cicero Avenue to the east. During the Austin area&#x27;s transition from a predominantly white community to a predominantly African-American community, the South Austin neighborhood was the first neighborhood to become African-American majority. The neighborhood is characterized by its numerous historic buildings. The neighborhood is home to six landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places: Austin Historic District, Midway Park, Austin Town Hall Park Historic District, Columbus Park, First Congregational Church of Austin, Joseph J. Walser House, and the Seth Warner House. Austin Town Hall Park, modeled after Philadelphia&#x27;s Independence Hall, is also in this neighborhood.

It is also home to an additional seven Chicago landmarks not listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Beeson House and Coach House, Hitchcock House, Laramie State Bank Building, Schlect House, F. R. Schock House, Marie Schock House, and the Third Unitarian Church.

==Demographics==
According to a 2016 analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, 99,711 people and 32,277 households were residing in the area.

The racial makeup of the area was 4.2% White, 84.2% African American, 0.5% Asian, and 0.80% from other races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 10.3% of the population.

In the area, the age distribution was 30.5% under 19, 20.8% from 20 to 34, 18.7% from 35 to 49, 18.4% from 50 to 64, and 11.60% who were 65 or older. The median age was 33.9 years.

The median household income for the area was $31,435 as opposed to $47,831 for the city. The area&#x27;s residents were disproportionately lower income; 41.0% of residents earned less than $25,000, 27.6% of residents earned between $25,000 and $49,999, 14.1% earned between $50,000 and $74,999, 8.0% earned between $75,000 and $99,999, 6.4% earned between $100,000 and $149,999, and 2.9% earned $150,000 or more.

About 41,807 residents were in the labor force; 18.9% of workers were employed in the healthcare industry, 11.3% were employed in retail, 11% were employed in administration, 8.4% worked in education, and 8.3% worked in hospitality and food services. The area had an unemployment rate of 22.1%.

==Crime==
According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; &quot;Crime in Chicagoland&quot; page, the Austin neighborhood ranked 11th out of 77 community areas in Chicago in violent crime, 25th among Chicago community areas in property crimes, and fifth out of 100 for quality-of-life crimes.

==Economy==
As of 2023, a general lack exists for food-oriented retail in Austin, and many people living in Austin go to suburban communities to the west to buy groceries. The Austin Town Hall City Market is held to stave off the food desert complex.

<text>Mathematical statistics is the application of probability theory and other mathematical concepts to statistics, as opposed to techniques for collecting statistical data. Specific mathematical techniques that are commonly used in statistics include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure theory.

==Introduction==
Statistical data collection is concerned with the planning of studies, especially with the design of randomized experiments and with the planning of surveys using random sampling. The initial analysis of the data often follows the study protocol specified prior to the study being conducted. The data from a study can also be analyzed to consider secondary hypotheses inspired by the initial results, or to suggest new studies. A secondary analysis of the data from a planned study uses tools from data analysis, and the process of doing this is mathematical statistics.

Data analysis is divided into:

* descriptive statistics – the part of statistics that describes data, i.e. summarises the data and their typical properties.
* inferential statistics – the part of statistics that draws conclusions from data (using some model for the data): For example, inferential statistics involves selecting a model for the data, checking whether the data fulfill the conditions of a particular model, and with quantifying the involved uncertainty (e.g. using confidence intervals).

While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies, they are also applied to other kinds of data. For example, from natural experiments and observational studies, in which case the inference is dependent on the model chosen by the statistician, and so subjective.

==Topics==
The following are some of the important topics in mathematical statistics:

===Probability distributions===

A probability distribution is a function that assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment, survey, or procedure of statistical inference. Examples are found in experiments whose sample space is non-numerical, where the distribution would be a categorical distribution; experiments whose sample space is encoded by discrete random variables, where the distribution can be specified by a probability mass function; and experiments with sample spaces encoded by continuous random variables, where the distribution can be specified by a probability density function. More complex experiments, such as those involving stochastic processes defined in continuous time, may demand the use of more general probability measures.

A probability distribution can either be univariate or multivariate. A univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single random variable taking on various alternative values; a multivariate distribution (a joint probability distribution) gives the probabilities of a random vector—a set of two or more random variables—taking on various combinations of values. Important and commonly encountered univariate probability distributions include the binomial distribution, the hypergeometric distribution, and the normal distribution. The multivariate normal distribution is a commonly encountered multivariate distribution.

====Special distributions====
*Normal distribution, the most common continuous distribution
*Bernoulli distribution, for the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial (e.g. success/failure, yes/no)
*Binomial distribution, for the number of &quot;positive occurrences&quot; (e.g. successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed total number of independent occurrences
*Negative binomial distribution, for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before a given number of successes occurs
*Geometric distribution, for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before the first success; a special case of the negative binomial distribution, where the number of successes is one.
*Discrete uniform distribution, for a finite set of values (e.g. the outcome of a fair die)
*Continuous uniform distribution, for continuously distributed values
*Poisson distribution, for the number of occurrences of a Poisson-type event in a given period of time
*Exponential distribution, for the time before the next Poisson-type event occurs
*Gamma distribution, for the time before the next k Poisson-type events occur
*Chi-squared distribution, the distribution of a sum of squared standard normal variables; useful e.g. for inference regarding the sample variance of normally distributed samples (see chi-squared test)
*Student&#x27;s t distribution, the distribution of the ratio of a standard normal variable and the square root of a scaled chi squared variable; useful for inference regarding the mean of normally distributed samples with unknown variance (see Student&#x27;s t-test)
*Beta distribution, for a single probability (real number between 0 and 1); conjugate to the Bernoulli distribution and binomial distribution

===Statistical inference===

Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from data that are subject to random variation, for example, observational errors or sampling variation. Initial requirements of such a system of procedures for inference and induction are that the system should produce reasonable answers when applied to well-defined situations and that it should be general enough to be applied across a range of situations. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and make estimations using sample data. Whereas descriptive statistics describe a sample, inferential statistics infer predictions about a larger population that the sample represents.

The outcome of statistical inference may be an answer to the question &quot;what should be done next?&quot;, where this might be a decision about making further experiments or surveys, or about drawing a conclusion before implementing some organizational or governmental policy.
For the most part, statistical inference makes propositions about populations, using data drawn from the population of interest via some form of random sampling. More generally, data about a random process is obtained from its observed behavior during a finite period of time. Given a parameter or hypothesis about which one wishes to make inference, statistical inference most often uses:
* a statistical model of the random process that is supposed to generate the data, which is known when randomization has been used, and
* a particular realization of the random process; i.e., a set of data.

===Regression===
In statistics, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many ways for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or &#x27;criterion variable&#x27;) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables – that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation target is a function of the independent variables called the regression function. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation of the dependent variable around the regression function which can be described by a probability distribution.

Many techniques for carrying out regression analysis have been developed. Familiar methods, such as linear regression, are parametric, in that the regression function is defined in terms of a finite number of unknown parameters that are estimated from the data (e.g. using ordinary least squares). Nonparametric regression refers to techniques that allow the regression function to lie in a specified set of functions, which may be infinite-dimensional.

===Nonparametric statistics===

Nonparametric statistics are values calculated from data in a way that is not based on parameterized families of probability distributions. They include both descriptive and inferential statistics. The typical parameters are the expectations, variance, etc. Unlike parametric statistics, nonparametric statistics make no assumptions about the probability distributions of the variables being assessed.

Non-parametric methods are widely used for studying populations that take on a ranked order (such as movie reviews receiving one to four stars). The use of non-parametric methods may be necessary when data have a ranking but no clear numerical interpretation, such as when assessing preferences. In terms of levels of measurement, non-parametric methods result in &quot;ordinal&quot; data.

As non-parametric methods make fewer assumptions, their applicability is much wider than the corresponding parametric methods. In particular, they may be applied in situations where less is known about the application in question. Also, due to the reliance on fewer assumptions, non-parametric methods are more robust.

One drawback of non-parametric methods is that since they do not rely on assumptions, they are generally less powerful than their parametric counterparts. Low power non-parametric tests are problematic because a common use of these methods is for when a sample has a low sample size. Many parametric methods are proven to be the most powerful tests through methods such as the Neyman–Pearson lemma and the Likelihood-ratio test.

Another justification for the use of non-parametric methods is simplicity. In certain cases, even when the use of parametric methods is justified, non-parametric methods may be easier to use. Due both to this simplicity and to their greater robustness, non-parametric methods are seen by some statisticians as leaving less room for improper use and misunderstanding.

==Statistics, mathematics, and mathematical statistics==
Mathematical statistics is a key subset of the discipline of statistics. Statistical theorists study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions.

Mathematicians and statisticians like Gauss, Laplace, and C. S. Peirce used decision theory with probability distributions and loss functions (or utility functions). The decision-theoretic approach to statistical inference was reinvigorated by Abraham Wald and his successors and makes extensive use of scientific computing, analysis, and optimization; for the design of experiments, statisticians use algebra and combinatorics. But while statistical practice often relies on probability and decision theory, their application can be controversial

<doc id="888715" wikidata="Q727645" url="?curid=888715" title="Jim Neidhart">
<text>James Henry Neidhart (February 8, 1955 – August 13, 2018) was an American professional wrestler known for his appearances in the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation as Jim &quot;the Anvil&quot; Neidhart, where he was a two-time WWF Tag Team Champion with his real-life brother-in-law Bret Hart in the Hart Foundation. He also won titles in Stampede Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Florida, Mid-South Wrestling, Memphis Championship Wrestling and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. He was part of the Hart wrestling family through marriage to his wife Ellie Hart, teaming with various members throughout his career, and appearing with his daughter Natalya Neidhart on the reality television show &quot;Total Divas&quot;.

== Early life ==
At Newport Harbor High School, Neidhart first gained athletic acclaim for his success in strength-oriented track and field events. He set a California high school record in shot put in 1973 which stood until 1985. After graduating from high school, Neidhart pursued a career in the National Football League (NFL), where he played for the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys in practices and preseason games.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1978–1985) ===
Following his release from the Dallas Cowboys, Neidhart traveled to Calgary to train with Stu Hart and pursue a career in professional wrestling. He worked for Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling from 1978 to 1983, and again in 1985, during which time he married Ellie Hart, one of Stu&#x27;s daughters. He was a two-time Stampede International Tag Team Champion, with Hercules Ayala in 1980 and Mr. Hito in 1983. Stu Hart, seeking publicity for Neidhart, promised him $500 to enter and win an anvil toss at the Calgary Stampede. He did, throwing it 11 feet, 2 inches. This earned him the nickname &quot;The Anvil&quot;, replacing his prior nickname, &quot;The Animal&quot;.

In September 1981, Neidhart appeared in Germany with the Catch Wrestling Association, taking part in the World Catch Cup. From April to May 1982, Neidhart wrestled in Japan for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on its Big Fight Series tour as part of Stampede Wrestling&#x27;s working relationship with NJPW. In January 1983, he made a second tour with NJPW, competing in its New Year Golden Series. 

Neidhart teamed twice with King Kong Bundy for Georgia Championship Wrestling in November 1983. From September 1983 to February 1984, he worked for Mid-South Wrestling, where he and Butch Reed held the Mid-South Tag Team Championship for two and a half months. In March 1984, he made a third tour of Japan with NJPW. From April to August 1984, Neidhart worked for the Continental Wrestling Association. In August 1984, he moved to Championship Wrestling from Florida, winning the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship and NWA United States Tag Team Championship. In January 1985, he left Florida to join the World Wrestling Federation.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1985–1992) ===

==== Hart Foundation (1985–1991) ====

When Stu Hart sold Stampede Wrestling to Vince McMahon, owner of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Neidhart and Bret Hart were included in the deal. Initially a singles wrestler, managed by Mr. Fuji, Neidhart debuted on January 21, 1985, in Madison Square Garden, defeating Tony Garea. He wrestled Hart, who had a cowboy gimmick, to a draw twice. Bret, upset with his gimmick, suggested to McMahon that he form a tag team with Neidhart.

The new team was dubbed the Hart Foundation and was managed by Jimmy Hart (no relation to Bret). They made their pay-per-view debut at WrestleMania 2, where they were the last two eliminated from a 20-man battle royal by André the Giant. The Hart Foundation won their first WWF World Tag Team Championship on the February 7, 1987, episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; (taped January 26) from The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and The Dynamite Kid), with the help of referee Danny Davis, who was continually &quot;distracted&quot; by checking on Dynamite (laid out of the match early by a megaphone shot from Jimmy), allowing the challengers to double-team Smith. Davis was subsequently fired as referee and began wrestling, aligned with The Hart Foundation. They lost the titles on the November 7 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; (taped October 27), to Strike Force (Rick Martel and Tito Santana).

The Hart Foundation wrestled in another 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV. Bad News Brown attacked and eliminated Hart to win. Neidhart eventually joined Bret&#x27;s side in the feud with Brown causing a rift between the team and manager Jimmy Hart. This led them to fire him and before starting a feud with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. In the fall of 1988, Jimmy Hart began managing the Rougeaus. The Hart Foundation unsuccessfully challenged Demolition (Ax and Smash) for the tag title at the 1988 SummerSlam, when Ax hit Hart with Jimmy Hart&#x27;s megaphone for the pin (Hart accompanied Demolition&#x27;s manager, Mr. Fuji, solely to further his feud with the challengers). The Hart Foundation continued feuding with Jimmy Hart&#x27;s wrestlers for the next year, teaming with Jim Duggan to defeat Dino Bravo and The Rougeaus in a 2/3 falls match at the 1989 Royal Rumble, then defeating The Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine at WrestleMania V. In April 1989, both Hart Foundation members began wrestling singles matches at house shows. Neidhart also had a few shots at Ravishing Rick Rude&#x27;s Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in August.

The Hart Foundation reformed full-time in March 1990 in Las Vegas. At WrestleMania VI in Toronto, they defeated The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov) in 19 seconds. They started a second feud with champions Demolition, who at this point added Crush. At SummerSlam 90 on August 27, The Hart Foundation won the title for a second time in a 2/3 falls match. On October 30, 1990, The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) defeated The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to seemingly win the title. During the match, the top rope broke by accident, and the match did not air on television. The Rockers defended the WWF Tag Team title against Power and Glory (Paul Roma and Hercules) on November 3, 1990. Shortly after November 3, the WWF decided to not air the title change and that the title would revert to the Hart Foundation. In his book, Shawn Michaels claims that the Hart Foundation had politicked to keep the title. The WWF has never officially recognized The Rockers&#x27; reign. The Hart Foundation soon reignited their feud with Jimmy Hart via his team, Rhythm and Blues (Honky Tonk and Valentine). Jimmy Hart once again cost The Hart Foundation the tag titles at WrestleMania VII, in a match with his new team, The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), when he distracted the referee, allowing Sags to knock out Neidhart with his motorcycle helmet. Hart and Neidhart again split up, though they reunited for a title rematch with The Nasty Boys on the July 29 &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, losing by disqualification when Bret hit both champions with a helmet, again introduced by Jimmy Hart. Neidhart also commentated on &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; alongside Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan from March until August 1991.

==== New Foundation (1991–1992) ====

Neidhart returned to WWF television on the November 9, 1991 episode of &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, donning new parachute pants with checkerboard designs. He suffered a loss to Ric Flair, who continued to apply his figure-four leglock after winning the match. While hobbling away to the back, Neidhart was attacked and further injured by the Beverly Brothers. This resulted in him being replaced in the 1991 Survivor Series by Sgt. Slaughter. 

Neidhart returned once more on the December 1, 1991 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, teaming with Owen Hart (Bret&#x27;s younger brother) as the New Foundation, defeating the Executioners (Executioner #1 and Executioner #2). The New Foundation&#x27;s highlight was a win over the Orient Express (Kato and Tanaka) at the January 1992 Royal Rumble. The team also had matches with the Beverly Brothers, the Nasty Boys, the Natural Disasters, and the Powers of Pain throughout late-1991 and early-1992, but had little success overall. The New Foundation wrestled their final match on February 15, 1992; Neidhart was fired the next day after refusing to take a drug test and throwing a television monitor backstage.

=== Various promotions (1992–1994) ===
After leaving the WWF in February 1992, Neidhart wrestled a handful of matches on the independent circuit, including two bouts for Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW). Beginning in August 1992, he made three tours with New Japan Pro-Wrestling: The G1 Climax in August (losing in the first round to Kensuke Sasaki), the Super Grade Tag League II in October (teaming with Tom Zenk and finishing with 0 points) and Battle Final in December.

In February and March 1993, Neidhart wrestled in Australia for the &quot;Wrestling Down Under&quot; promotion, working three matches with Jake Roberts.

In December 1993, Neidhart promoted several shows in Florida under the banner &quot;Anvil Promotions&quot;.

Throughout early 1994, Neidhart wrestled for various independent promotions.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1993) ===
In April 1993, Neidhart began wrestling for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), making his debut on the May 15 episode of &quot;WCW Worldwide&quot;, beating a jobber, Todd Zane. After defeating Mustapha Saed on the next episode, Neidhart teamed with Junkyard Dog for the next, again beating Chick Donovan and Rip Rogers. Neidhart and The Junkyard Dog beat Paul Orndorff and Dick Slater by disqualification on the June 5 &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;. Eleven days later, he beat Shanghai Pierce in a dark match before Clash of the Champions XXIII. After losing to Maxx Payne at a house show in Kokomo, Indiana, on October 7, Neidhart left WCW.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993) ===
On November 13, 1993, Neidhart wrestled The Sandman to a no contest at ECW&#x27;s November to Remember in the ECW Arena.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1994-1995) ===

Neidhart returned to the WWF at King of the Ring in June 1994 as Bret Hart&#x27;s cornerman for his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match defense against Intercontinental Champion Diesel. After Diesel hit Hart with his Jackknife finisher, Neidhart interfered to prevent the pin, and disqualifying Hart, but allowing him to retain the title. After the match, Diesel and Shawn Michaels beat down Hart, and Neidhart didn&#x27;t intervene. Later that night, Neidhart reappeared at ringside again during Owen Hart&#x27;s King of the Ring tournament final against Razor Ramon. He attacked Razor outside the ring, behind the referee&#x27;s back, before Neidhart throwing Razor back for Hart to elbow drop and pin to become &quot;The King of Harts&quot;, turning heel for the first time since 1988. Owen had been feuding with Bret since the Royal Rumble. Neidhart, believing Bret had held Owen back from his potential, sided with Owen, and usually cornering him in matches through the summer. Neidhart claimed he&#x27;d only helped Bret keep the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at King of the Ring so Owen could take it from him. This opportunity came in a steel cage match at SummerSlam. Neidhart sat in the third row during the match, behind other Hart family members. After Bret won the match, Neidhart entered the cage, locked it and helped Owen beat him down, while the Hart family members tried to climb over it and save him. Following SummerSlam, Neidhart teamed with Owen to face Bret and Randy Savage/The British Bulldog in a series of tag team bouts.

Neidhart joined Owen on Shawn Michaels&#x27; team, The Teamsters, to face Razor Ramon and The Bad Guys in an elimination match at Survivor Series. After they eliminated every Bad Guy except Razor, after Michaels inadvertently hit Diesel with the Sweet Chin Music. This caused an argument and the tag team partners split up, before Diesel chased Michaels down the aisle. As the other Teamsters tried to intervene, and all were counted out. Because Diesel and Michaels were WWF Tag Team Champions when they split, the title was vacated and a tournament held. Neidhart and Hart lost to The New Headshrinkers (Fatu and Sionne) in the first round on the December 31 &quot;Superstars&quot;, by disqualification. By the time it aired, Neidhart had left the WWF. Bret Hart wrote in his autobiography that the original plan was for Owen and Neidhart to win the tournament and the WWF Tag Team Championships, but Neidhart was officially fired due to no-showing events. Hart wound up winning the WWF Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania XI with new partner Yokozuna.

=== Various promotions (1995–1997) ===
After leaving the WWF once again, Neidhart returned to the ring in February 1995 for the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation (MEWF). Over the following months, he wrestled for various independent promotions. In April 1995, he returned to ECW, losing to Marty Jannetty and Ron Simmons on consecutive nights. After several more matches on the independent circuit, in July 1995 Neidhart made a one-night appearance with the Catch Wrestling Association in Graz, Austria, competing in the Euro Catch Festival. Later that month, Neidhart appeared with ECW once more, wrestling Marty Jannetty to a double disqualification. Over the following few months, he continued to wrestle on the independent circuit, briefly holding the MEWF Heavyweight Championship. In November and December 1995, Neidhart worked for the Catch Wrestling Association in Germany, competing in the CWA International Catch Cup tournament.

Neidhart wrestled sporadically throughout early-1996, including appearing at the World Wrestling Peace Festival in June 1996. He returned to the World Wrestling Federation later that month.

After leaving the WWF once more, in October 1996 Neidhart wrestling in England for Hammerlock Wrestling. In December 1996, he began appearing with the New York-based independent promotion Ultimate Championship Wrestling. In March 1997, he appeared with the Sacramento, California-based National Wrestling Conference.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1996, 1997)===

==== Who (1996) ====
On the July 6, 1996, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Neidhart returned to the WWF as the masked heel &quot;Who&quot;, a gimmick designed for commentators Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler to make &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;-style jokes during his matches (all of which he lost).

==== Hart Foundation reunion (1997) ====
Neidhart returned to the WWF once more on the April 28, 1997, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, attacking Stone Cold Steve Austin and reuniting with Bret and Owen Hart as part of the new Hart Foundation, a stable of Canadian sympathizers, also including Davey Boy Smith and Brian Pillman. On July 6 at In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede in Bret&#x27;s hometown Calgary, The Hart Foundation defeated the American team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust and The Legion of Doom. Neidhart was part of Team Canada at Survivor Series in Montreal, teaming with The British Bulldog, Doug Furnas and Philip Lafon defeated Team USA Vader, Goldust, &quot;Marvelous&quot; Marc Mero and the debut of &quot;The Lethal Weapon&quot; Steve Blackman (Bulldog was the sole survivor, Neidhart was pinned by Vader). 

After Bret and Davey Boy Smith left the WWF on bad terms because of the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series. D-Generation X (DX) leader and WWF Champion Shawn Michaels offered Neidhart a spot in the group on the November 24 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. Neidhart accepted, only for it to be revealed as a setup as the group assaulted Neidhart at the end of the show. The following week on the December 1 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, DX member Triple H defeated Neidhart. After the match, DX attacked Neidhart once again and spray-painted &quot;WCW&quot; on his back and signifying him following Bret Hart to World Championship Wrestling. Sgt. Slaughter and Ken Shamrock saved him, before Slaughter and Shamrock attacked D-Generation X at the end of the show. His last match in WWF was when he defeated The Sultan at a house show on December 1. WWF announced that Neidhart was released from his WWF contract on December 2, 1997.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1998) ===
Neidhart returned to World Championship Wrestling on the January 12, 1998 episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. The week prior, Ric Flair had given an interview in which he claimed to be a better wrestler than Bret Hart. After Neidhart rejected Flair&#x27;s claim during an interview with Gene Okerlund, Flair attacked Neidhart, hitting him with a pair of brass knuckles and then applying a ringpost figure-four leglock to Neidhart until being driven off by Bret Hart.

Neidhart wrestled his first return match for WCW on the January 20, 1998 episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, defeating Wayne Bloom. In February 1998, Neidhart formed a tag team with the British Bulldog, who had also departed the WWF following the Montreal Screwjob. Neidhart and British Bulldog wrestled primarily on &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;, facing tag teams such as The Public Enemy, The Destruction Crew, High Voltage, nWo Japan, Sting and Lex Luger, and Brian Adams and Curt Hennig. In September 1998 at Fall Brawl &#x27;98: War Games, Neidhart and the British Bulldog defeated The Dancing Fools in a tag team match. 

Neidhart&#x27;s final televised match for WCW was on the September 26, 1998 episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; where he and the British Bulldog lost to Stevie Ray and Vincent. Neidhart went on to wrestle on house shows until being released from WCW in October 1998.

=== Late career (1998–2016)===

Following his departure from WCW, Neidhart largely retired from the ring, but continued to make sporadic appearances in independent shows. Notably, he was booked as Jake Roberts&#x27; singles opponent in the ill-fated Heroes of Wrestling event in October 1999. In 2000, he wrestled for a few appearances for Memphis Championship Wrestling. From 2000 to 2003 he wrestled in Canada for Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling, and Border City Wrestling. On January 17, 2003, he lost to Jim Duggan at Border City&#x27;s main event at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada. On September 23, 2006, he defeated Norman Smiley at the UXW Florida Debut show in Orlando. he appeared in TNA on the November 12, 2009, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; winning against Jay Lethal in his initial open challenge thrown out to the legends of professional wrestling.

On &quot;Raw XV&quot;, the 15th-anniversary &quot;WWE Raw&quot; special on December 10, 2007, Neidhart returned to WWE for the first time since 1997, and participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal, eventually making it to the final five before being eliminated by Skinner.

Neidhart&#x27;s last known match was on March 5, 2016, when he teamed with Koko B. Ware and Frankie the Pizza Guy as they defeated Nikolai Volkoff, Clay Dasher and Shawn Andrews at a BCW event in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

==Professional wrestling style and persona ==
Neidhart usually wrestled in pink attire and the Hart Foundation tag team was nicknamed &quot;The Pink and Black Attack&quot;. It popularized the Hart Attack finisher maneuver.

== Other media ==
On April 6, 2010, WWE released &quot;Hart &amp; Soul: The Hart Family Anthology&quot; on DVD, which is a three-disc set featuring a documentary on the Hart wrestling family (including Neidhart) as well as 12 matches. Neidhart&#x27;s daughter Natalie was featured as a main cast member on the reality show &quot;Total Divas&quot;, and he made appearances on the show along with his wife.

== Personal life ==

Neidhart and wife, Ellie Hart had three daughters; one, Natalie Neidhart-Wilson, is a professional wrestler under the ring name &quot;Natalya&quot;, currently signed to WWE.

Neidhart was arrested on September 6, 2010, and charged with two counts of possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute, two counts of trafficking illegal drugs, one count of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, and one count of third-degree grand theft for property stolen between $300 and $5,000. He was arrested after becoming aggressive with police after ingesting multiple pills outside a gas station. In March 2012, he was sentenced to five months and 29 days in jail. During his sentencing, he was arrested and held in contempt of court. Neidhart completed two stints in rehabilitation paid for by WWE.

== Death ==
According to TMZ, Neidhart&#x27;s wife Elizabeth told investigators that on August 13, 2018, he was having problems sleeping and got out of bed to adjust the thermostat. As he went to touch it, he &quot;turned weirdly as if he were about to dance&quot;, then fell against the wall and floor. She immediately dialed 911, believing he was having a seizure, something for which he took medication. He had a four-inch long gash on his face when emergency services arrived. He died at the scene at age 63, with the Pasco County Sheriff&#x27;s Office stating to TMZ that their preliminary investigation believed he hit his head and succumbed due to his injuries, with foul play not being suspected. At the time, his wife stated his doctors believed he may have had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. WWE later paid tribute to Neidhart on their website.

<text>HMS &quot;A5&quot; was an early Royal Navy submarine. She was a member of Group Two of the first British of submarines. Like all members of her class, she was built at Vickers Barrow-in-Furness.

==Design and construction==
The A-class was designed by Vickers as an improvement on the previous American designed Holland-class submarines, and were the first class of British-designed submarines. Four submarines, –, were ordered as part of the 1902–1903 construction programme for the Royal Navy, with a further nine (&quot;A5&quot;–) ordered under the 1903–1904 programme. The design of the submarines was revised between the prototype boat, &quot;A1&quot;, and the other three submarines of the first order, and again for the submarines of the 1903–04 programme, with this batch being fitted with a second torpedo tube.

&quot;A5&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of when surfaced. Displacement was about surfaced and submerged. A 16-cylinder Wolsey petrol engine powered the submarine on the surface, driving the submarine&#x27;s single propeller shaft, while submerged propulsion was via a electric motor, giving a speed of on the surface and dived. Armament was two 18 inch (45.7 cm) torpedo tubes in the ship&#x27;s bow. Four torpedoes were carried.

&quot;A5&quot; was laid down at Vicker&#x27;s Barrow-in-Furness shipyard in 1903, was launched on 3 March 1904 and completed on 11 February 1905.

==Service history==
Immediately after commissioning she and her tender travelled to Queenstown, (now Cobh) Ireland. On 16 February 1905 at 10:05 whilst tied up alongside &quot;Hazard&quot; an explosion occurred on board, with a second explosion about 30 minutes later. Five of the crew were killed by the explosion. The captain, Lieutenant H J G Good, and the other four crew members survived.

An enquiry into the accident concluded that petrol fumes had been ignited by an electrical spark, with the second explosion caused by smouldering debris from the first event.

She was returned to Barrow-in-Furness the following month for repairs and returned to service in the Home Fleet in October. She was used for training until paid off for disposal in December 1915 and was finally broken up in Portsmouth in 1920.

==Memorial==
The Irish Naval Service donated a granite block with a brass plaque giving details of the A5 tragedy, and this was unveiled in March 2000.

On 13 February 2005 there was a ceremony to mark the centenary of the accident.
 of the Irish Naval Service and of the Royal Navy visited Cobh for the occasion.

<text>Emund Eriksson (?-c. 970), (English: Edmund), was a Swedish king whose historicity is only known from a single source, the Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum which was written by Adam of Bremen in c. 1075.

==Reign==

According to Adam of Bremen, a certain King Ring ruled the Swedes together with his sons Erik and Emund in about 936. In a later chapter, Adam mentions Emund Eriksson as ruling Sweden some time in the second half of the 10th century. He was presumably the son of Erik Ringsson. Adam relates that Emund was king at the same time as King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark (c. 958/64-985) expanded his power overseas and subdued Norway (in about 970). Emund was an ally of Harald, and showed a friendly attitude to Christian people who came to him. That German missionary efforts were renewed about this time is related by Adam in the following chapter. The Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, Adaldag (937-988), appointed a Dane called Odinkar the Elder for the Swedish lands. Being a pious man of noble stock, he could &quot;easily convince the wild peoples about everything concerning our religion&quot;.

==Dynastic position==

Emund Eriksson is not known to the later Norse sagas and king-lists. Information about him may have come from Adam&#x27;s interview with the Danish King Sweyn Estridsen, Harald Bluetooth&#x27;s great-grandson. To the extent that he is historical, he may have ruled in the third quarter of the 10th century. The next Swedish king mentioned by Adam of Bremen is Eric the Victorious (died c. 995), but he does not tell how they were related. It has even been speculated that Eric the Victorious belonged to a Geatic clan which gained power in the Mälaren Valley and founded Sigtuna in c. 980. Nevertheless, the name Emund was common in the late Viking Age dynasty of Sweden, but extremely rare outside of it, which suggests a dynastic continuity. An option is that Emund Eriksson was the brother of Björn (III) Eriksson, who the Norse sagas name as the son of Eric Anundsson and the father of Eric the Victorious. This would have been in accordance with the Germanic system of co-rulership (Diarchy) in which two brothers were elected kings and which, according to the sagas, was sometimes used by the Swedes. If this is the case, several generations of Swedish rulers were conflated by tradition, explaining the differences between Adam of Bremen and the Norse sagas.

==Design and description==

&quot;A13&quot; was a member of the first British class of submarines, although slightly larger, faster and more heavily armed than the lead ship, .

When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. The heavy oil engine was heavier than the petrol engines used by the other boats in the class and an equal amount of fuel had to be removed, which reduced their range despite the heavy oil engine&#x27;s more economical consumption.

<text>Parkland Memorial Hospital is a public hospital located in Dallas, Texas. It is the main hospital of the Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System and serves as Dallas County&#x27;s public hospital. It is located within the Southwestern Medical District. The hospital is partially staffed by the faculty, residents, and medical students of UT Southwestern Medical Center.

==History==

=== Original campus ===

The original hospital opened on May 19, 1894, in a wooden building on a meadow located at Oak Lawn and Maple avenues. The name Parkland came from the land on which the hospital was built, originally purchased by the city as a park. A brick building (the first hospital brick building erected in Texas, now owned by Crow Holdings) replaced the wooden facility in 1913. All services from the campus at Maple Avenue were decommissioned in 1974.

=== 1954–2015 campus ===
In 1954, Parkland moved to 5201 Harry Hines Boulevard, about a mile from its original site. Its renal dialysis unit opened in 1955, the burns unit in 1961, and the cardiac intensive care unit in 1969. The new Parkland tower blocks were redeveloped in 1981, and the triangular wing at the hospital&#x27;s entrance on Harry Hines Boulevard opened in the late 1980s.

The former hospital site at 5201 Harry Hines Boulevard was demolished in 2024, after closing on July 11, 2022.

==== John F. Kennedy assassination ====
Parkland Hospital is best known as the hospital where three individuals associated with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy either died or were pronounced dead: President Kennedy himself; his assassin Lee Harvey Oswald; and Jack Ruby, who later killed Oswald. The 2013 film &quot;Parkland&quot; dramatizes the deaths of Kennedy and Oswald in the hospital.

After he was shot on November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was rushed to Parkland, where he was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m. in Trauma Room 1, thirty minutes after he was shot at Dealey Plaza. At the same time, Texas governor John Connally, wounded in the same shooting, was treated in Trauma Room 2, and survived. Two days after the assassination, November 24, Oswald was rushed to Parkland after being shot in the abdomen by Ruby and died in operating room #5 after over ninety minutes of surgery. Ruby died on January 3, 1967, in the same emergency department, from a pulmonary embolism associated with lung cancer.

Since Ruby&#x27;s death in 1967, areas in the Old Parkland Hospital where Kennedy was pronounced dead and Oswald was operated on had been remodeled. A plaque there marked the location where Trauma Room 1 was previously in the prior Parkland, and then became a corridor in the hospital&#x27;s radiology department. The ambulance entry remained in roughly the same location. The site of Trauma Room 1 was renovated several times since 1963. Trauma Room 1 was dismantled for renovation in 1973; all building materials and equipment from the room were retained by the government and remain in archival storage today. Parkland&#x27;s JFK history is noted on a wall at the new hospital and at the John F. Kennedy Park for Hope, Healing and Heroes memorial on campus.

=== New campus ===
Parkland&#x27;s high volume of patients led to the decision by the Dallas County Commissioners Court to propose replacing the overcrowded, 50+-year-old building with a new , 17-story, 862-bed facility, along with a new outpatient center, a office facility, and parking for 6,000 cars. The total cost would be $1.27 billion, to be paid for through three avenues: 1) a $747 million bond proposition (contingent on voter approval, which was obtained in November 2008), 2) $350 million of cash from current and future operations, and 3) $150 million from private donations.

The board approved nearly $100 million in contracts and hired two architectural firms – HDR, Inc. (based in Omaha, Nebraska, but operates a large practice in Dallas) and Corgan (based in Dallas) – to design the new building. (A parking garage was completed as a design/build project by The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company and the architecture firm of Omniplan in January 2012.) In addition to Dallas County taxpayers funding the public hospital, large private donations were made as well, over the next five years; one major donation of $1 million was made by the Bank of America Charitable Foundation. Donors have their names permanently etched in glass panels in the two-story, glass atrium main lobby.

One major feature of the new facility is that movements of staff and supplies are handled in separate corridors and elevators from those used by patients and visitors.

The formal groundbreaking ceremony was held in October 2010; the facility was officially dedicated in March 2015, with all patients and staff officially occupying the facility that August. On August 20, 2015, Parkland opened a new emergency department and began accepting patients; construction had commenced in 2010. Staff members and patients were transferred throughout the next few days, from 5201 Harry Hines Boulevard to the new hospital located across the street at 5200 Harry Hines Boulevard. The new hospital welcomed its first birth, a boy delivered by Caesarean section, that same morning.

The new facility is immediately across Harry Hines Boulevard from the former hospital complex and is served by the Trinity Railway Express at Medical/Market Center Station and the Southwestern Medical District/Parkland station of DART light rail, which opened in December 2010.

==Awards and recognition==
Parkland has been recognized by the American Hospital Association as one of the nation&#x27;s Most Wired™ Hospitals for excellence in using technology to fill gaps in care and partner with patients on health. The hospital received this recognition 2014–2017 and 2020.

Parkland was awarded The Joint Commission&#x27;s Gold Seal of Approval® and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association&#x27;s Heart-Check mark in 2017 for Advanced Certification for Comprehensive Stroke Centers.

In 2017, Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System was recognized as a Top Performer in LGBT Healthcare Equality by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation, the educational arm of the country&#x27;s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights organization. Parkland earned top marks in meeting non-discrimination and training criteria that demonstrate its commitment to equitable, inclusive care for LGBT patients and their families.

Parkland&#x27;s main campus is currently the largest ENERGY STAR® certified healthcare campus in the U.S., with over 3.1 million square feet of space recognized by this certification. In addition, the campus has six LEED Gold certified buildings, the first of which was awarded in 2013, that employ water reclamation, solar energy, and native landscaping. Parkland is also the second largest adopter of renewable energy in the Texas healthcare sector, earning the hospital recognition in the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Green Power Partnership.

In 2024, Parkland received The Joint Commission’s Sustainable Healthcare Certification (SHC) by prioritizing environmental sustainability and decarbonization.

==Leadership==
In May 2017, Fred Cerise, MD, MPH, president and CEO of Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System was appointed by the U.S. Comptroller General to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC). As a member of the commission, Dr. Cerise serves as a national advisor to Congress on issues affecting Medicaid and CHIP.

==Parkland Trauma Department==
In 2016, the staff of Parkland&#x27;s Rees-Jones Trauma Center began an initiative to teach classes to the community members so that they can learn how to recognize life-threatening bleeding and administer appropriate medical treatment before professional rescuers arrive. Parkland &quot;Stop the Bleed&quot; classes have been adapted from courses including the U.S. Military&#x27;s Tactical combat Casualty Care Guidelines and the Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) course and a part of a large U.S. Government effort to make &quot;Stop the Bleed&quot; training the CPR of the 21st century.

The staff of Parkland Memorial Hospital&#x27;s Emergency Department and Rees-Jones Trauma Center received the 2016 Texas Preparedness Leadership Award for &quot;Outstanding Service in Response to the 2016 Dallas Police Shootings.&quot; The award was presented at the 2016 Preparedness Coalition Symposium held Oct. 12–14 in Galveston.

==Capabilities==
Parkland is the Dallas County public hospital; funds are primarily provided by a specially designated property tax on Dallas County residents.

Parkland serves as one of Dallas&#x27;s five Level I Trauma Centers (alongside Baylor University Medical Center, Methodist Dallas Medical Center, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, and Children&#x27;s Medical Center), a primary care center for Dallas County residents, and (along with UT Southwestern) as a medical and surgical referral center for North Texas and parts of Southern Oklahoma. Thus, virtually all medical and surgical subspecialties are represented—which makes Parkland a destination for post-graduate medical training. The Parkland Burn Center, one of the largest civilian burn units in the U.S., is famous for the Parkland Formula for fluid resuscitation, developed by Charles R. Baxter in the 1960s. The fame of the Parkland Formula is due to its being one of the first treatments for burn that included rehydration and electrolytic management.

Parkland ranks among the largest teaching hospitals in the nation. Texas Woman&#x27;s University began its Bachelor of Science nursing program at Parkland in 1954 and it is still located within walking distance of the Parkland campus. Parkland also serves as the major teaching hospital of the adjacent University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

It has the distinction of delivering more infants under one roof than any other hospital in the nation, averaging 15–16,000 deliveries per year. Parkland Memorial has eleven prenatal clinics and employs 72 doctors training to become obstetricians-gynecologists and 45 nurse-midwives. In 2005, the staff delivered 15,590 babies, an average of more than 42 infants per day. Parkland created one of the first high-risk antenatal units in the nation and had the first neonatal intensive care unit in North Texas.

Parkland has approximately 240,000 emergency visits a year, for the co-located main emergency department (153,915 visits in 2013), and the urgent care unit (60,013 visits in 2013).

Parkland is also the base for Biotel, the medical direction system used by Dallas Fire-Rescue as well as fourteen other emergency medical service agencies in the Metroplex.

==Hatcher Station Health Center==
In May, 2014, a new 44,300-square-foot, Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System-affiliated outpatient clinic near Fair Park began construction on a 7-acre site adjacent to DART&#x27;s Hatcher Station. The $19.8 million clinic, which was designed by BOKA Powell for Frazier Revitalization Inc. and Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System, serves geriatric and behavioral health patients, along with adults, women, children, and infants. It also provides on-site diagnostic imaging and lab services. Exam rooms feature flexible equipment setups, and an on-site conference facility accommodates education and wellness programs. The clinic, officially named Hatcher Station Health Center, opened on May 19, 2015.

<text>HMS &quot;A9&quot; was an submarine built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. After surviving World War I, she was sold for scrap in 1920.

==Design and description==
&quot;A9&quot; was a member of the first British class of submarines, although slightly larger, faster and more heavily armed than the lead ship, . The submarine had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The A-class submarines had a crew of 2 officers and 9 ratings.

For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 16-cylinder Wolseley petrol engine that drove one propeller shaft. When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, &quot;A9&quot; had a range of at ; submerged the boat had a range of at .

The boats were armed with two 18-inch (45 cm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as doing so that they had to compensate for their weight by an equivalent weight of fuel.

==Construction and career==
&quot;A9&quot; was ordered as part of the 1903–04 Naval Programme from at Vickers. She was laid down at the shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in 1903, launched on 8 February 1905 and completed on 8 May 1905.

On 15 July 1908, under the command of Lieutenant Clifford Warren, &quot;A9&quot; was part of a flotilla of seven Royal Navy submarines making passage from Portland Harbour to Dover accompanied by the Apollo-class cruiser &quot;Aeolus&quot;. When passing abeam Folkstone it was noticed that &quot;A9&quot; was having difficulty keeping station within the formation and assistance was sent from &quot;Aeolus&quot;. Due to a technical malfunction of a valve a leak of carbon monoxide had occurred within the submarine, which rendered the six-man crew unconscious. Second in command Lieutenant Eric Groves made several attempts to enter the hull and initiate a rescue but was subsequently overcome by the fumes. With the use of wet cloths to cover his face a further attempt was made. This proved to be successful and Lt. Groves managed to cut the fuel supply to the submarine&#x27;s engines, but in turn also fell unconscious. However by doing so a rescue party from &quot;Aeolus&quot; were able to enter the hull and effect the extraction of the sailors, including Lt. Groves who was found slumped over the engine.

<text>HMS &quot;A8&quot; was an early Royal Navy submarine.

She was a member of Group Two of the 1903 British A-class of submarines. Like the other members of her class, she was built at Vickers Barrow-in-Furness.

She sank with the loss of 15 crew as a result of an accident whilst running on the surface in Plymouth Sound on 8 June 1905. A sudden dip in the bow caused the submarine to be swamped through the hatch in the conning tower.Only 4 survived. She was salvaged four days after the accident at which point a loose rivet was found in the bow plating. The submarine was then repaired and recommissioned and used for training during the First World War along with &quot;A9&quot; as part of the First Submarine Flotilla, operating near Devonport through early 1916. She was scrapped in October 1920 at Dartmouth.

<text>HMS &quot;A7&quot; was an submarine built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She sank in a training accident in 1914 with the loss of her entire crew. Efforts to salvage her failed and her wreck is a protected site. Diving on her is prohibited without a licence from the Ministry of Defence.

She sank in Whitsand Bay, Cornwall on 16 January 1914 with the loss of her crew whilst carrying out dummy torpedo attacks on in conjunction with submarine . A disturbance in the water was seen which thought to be caused by the crew of &quot;A7&quot; attempting to blow water from her ballast tanks in a desperate attempt to reach the surface. The location was marked with a buoy and &quot;Pygmy&quot; returned to Plymouth Sound to report on the disaster. &quot;Pygmy&quot; returned to the site in the afternoon but was unable to locate the buoy as the weather had deteriorated. It then took five days to relocate the submarine, she was found in depth with of her stern buried in the muddy seabed and with her bow off the bottom, raised at an angle of 30°. Several attempts were made to salvage her over the next month by attaching a hawser to the towing eye on the bow or wrapping steel hawsers around her hull, but her stern was too deeply embedded in the mud and the hawsers parted without pulling her out. She lies today where she sank, buried up to her waterline in a flat, mud seabed in about of water. In 2001, she was declared as one of 16 wrecks in British waters designated as &quot;Controlled Sites&quot; under the Protection of Military Remains Act by the British Government and which cannot be dived without special permission.

In 2014 the SHIPS Project team in Plymouth completed an archaeological investigation of the A7 submarine, having been granted a licence by the UK Ministry of Defence.

<text>U.S. Route 33 (US 33) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs northwest–southeast for from northern Indiana to Richmond, Virginia, passing through Ohio and West Virginia en route. Although most odd-numbered U.S. routes are north–south, US 33 is labeled east–west throughout its route, except in Indiana where it is labeled north–south. It roughly follows a historic trail used by Native Americans from Chesapeake Bay to Lake Michigan.

As of 2018, the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is at US 20 in southeastern Elkhart, Indiana, although it once extended to St. Joseph, Michigan, and even to Lake Michigan Beach, Michigan. Until 1998, the route extended northward through South Bend, Indiana, to Niles. Its current eastern (or southern) terminus is Richmond, Virginia. State Route 33 (SR 33) then continues eastward through West Point to Stingray Point, on the Middle Peninsula and Chesapeake Bay near Deltaville, Virginia.

Part of US 33 was created in conjunction with the Blue and Gray Trail in 1938 in order to promote a direct and scenic route between the Great Lakes and Virginia&#x27;s historic Tidewater region.

===Indiana===

From its terminus at US 20 on the southeast side of Elkhart, US 33 is a winding road that cuts diagonally from northwest to southeast through Northeast Indiana and serves as Main Street or a portion of Main Street in several cities and towns, including Elkhart, Dunlap, and Churubusco. The road is the main overland link between the Fort Wayne and South Bend metropolitan statistical areas. 

On the west side of Fort Wayne, US 33 joins US 30 near Interstate 69 (I-69), then follows the Interstate south, intersecting with State Road 14 (SR 14) and US 24 before turning east to follow the I-469 bypass around the southwest side of Fort Wayne. At the intersection with SR 1 south of the Fort Wayne International Airport, I-469/US 33 turns to the northeast until it intersects US 27 at the Fort Wayne suburb of Hessen Cassel, where US 33 splits off to the southeast to follow US 27 as a combined highway toward Decatur.

At Decatur, US 33/US 27 becomes a north–south road before it intersects with US 224 and continues as such until US 33 splits from US 27 south of Decatur and heads east toward the Ohio state line, intersecting SR 101 at Pleasant Mills along the way.

===Ohio===

In Ohio, the highway runs at a generally southeast–northwest angle from the west-central to the southeastern part of the state, passing through mostly rural territory except for a significant portion running through downtown Columbus. Most of the route in the state, particularly east of Columbus, is expressway. The highway crosses over the Ravenswood Bridge into West Virginia.

===West Virginia===
US 33 extends in West Virginia, from the Ohio River at Ravenswood to the Virginia state line atop Shenandoah Mountain west of Harrisonburg, Virginia.

Shortly after entering West Virginia and crossing the Ohio River, US 33 turns south, joining I-77 to Ripley. The route then turns east from I-77, joining US 119 at Spencer, then passing through extremely rural areas of Roane, Calhoun, Gilmer, and Lewis counties.

US 33 intersects I-79 at Weston. From I-79 east, US 33 is a four-lane highway, part of Corridor H of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The four-lane segment continues on through rural areas of Upshur, and Randolph counties, to just a couple miles past Elkins.

At Harding, US 250 joins US 33 for several miles after Elkins, where US 33 joins West Virginia Route 55 (WV 55) and returns to a two-lane road, except for a section of four-lane across Kelly Mountain between Canfield and Bowden. Passing through the Monongahela National Forest, US 33 crosses the Eastern Continental Divide between Harman and Onego at about in elevation, entering Pendleton County, then descends the Allegheny Front along Seneca Creek, skirting the north end of Spruce Mountain, at the highest point of the Allegheny Mountains.

US 33 then joins WV 28 at Seneca Rocks and continues south in the Potomac River headwaters through scenic forest and farmland landscapes. Turning eastward from WV 28 at Judy Gap, US 33 crosses North Fork Mountain at about , with a turnout on the western slope offering a scenic view of the Germany Valley below and the more distant Allegheny Front from Spruce Knob to Dolly Sods. US 220 joins US 33 for about half a mile in Franklin. After Franklin, US 33 continues eastward through rural areas, then climbs steeply to cross Shenandoah Mountain at Dry River Gap at about into Rockingham County, Virginia.

===Virginia===


US 33 extends in Virginia from the West Virginia state line west of Harrisonburg across the Shenandoah Valley, Blue Ridge Mountains, and Atlantic Piedmont to Richmond. It enters Virginia from West Virginia on Shenandoah Mountain. After going down the mountain, it passes through the unincorporated community of Rawley Springs. After traveling from Rawley Springs, reaches the independent city of Harrisonburg and intersects major routes State Route 42 (SR 42), US 11, and I-81 before leaving the city. The four-lane highway passes around the southernmost end of Massanutten Mountain, towards Elkton. There, it intersects US 340. After leaving Elkton, the highway heads towards the Blue Ridge Mountains, once it gets to the mountains, it reduces to two lanes and becomes three lanes a few times. At Swift Run Gap it intersects Skyline Drive and enters Greene County. After going down the mountains, it goes back to four lanes and heads south of Stanardsville. After that, the route heads southeast towards US 29 in Ruckersville. After that, it heads south east and enters Orange County. It heads east north of the Albemarle County line and intersects SR 20 on a concurrency. After that, it goes through a small part of the Southwest Mountains towards Gordonsville. It goes on a roundabout with US 15 and SR 231. US 33 heads east with US 15 and into Louisa County. Shortly after, US 33 splits from US 15 and heads southeast towards Louisa. In Trevilians, it intersects SR 22.The route then goes east toward Montpelier. In Montpelier, the route goes southeast towards Interstate 295. After I-295, US 33 goes a few miles to an interchange with I-64. Just after, the route meets US 250. The two routes head southeast into Downtown Richmond. Both meet their eastern terminus there. From Richmond, &quot;Route 33&quot; continues east as SR 33 across the Atlantic coastal plain through the Tidewater region of the Middle Peninsula to reach the Chesapeake Bay at Stingray Point just east of Deltaville.
==History==
The US 33 designation was established January 1, 1938; it and the Blue and Gray Trail were dedicated on May 2 of that year in multiple ceremonies. At the time, US 33 extended into the state of Michigan near Niles up to a terminus in St. Joseph, following US 31.

In November 1960, US  33 was extended to a junction with I-196/US 31 near Lake Michigan Beach, north of St. Joseph. In 1986, the highway was truncated south of Niles to the junction with US 12. In April 1998, it was truncated again to Elkhart, Indiana. Before its second truncation, it passed through Mishawaka and South Bend. Former segments of US 33 are now known as M-63, M-139, M-51, and State Road 933.

Various segments of US 33 have been improved to limited-access freeways. These include Ohio segments from St. Marys to Wapakoneta; Huntsville (near Bellefontaine) to Dublin (a northwestern suburb of Columbus); and bypasses around Lancaster, Nelsonville, Athens, and Pomeroy.

In West Virginia, US 33 from Interstate 79 near Weston east nearly to Elkins is four-lane, built as part of Corridor H of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The route&#x27;s steep grade up Shenandoah Mountain in easternmost West Virginia has been widened, with some sharp curves improved.

<text>Sigurd Ring (Old Norse: &quot;Sigurðr Hringr&quot;, in some sources merely called &quot;Hringr&quot;) according to legend was a king of the Swedes, being mentioned in many old Scandinavian sagas. According to these sources he was granted rulership over Sweden as a vassal king under his uncle Harald Wartooth. Later he would take up arms against his uncle Harald in a bid to overthrow him and take the crown of Denmark, a conflict which Sigurd eventually won after the legendary Battle of the Brávellir, where it is said that Odin himself intervened and killed Harald. In the Sagas, Sigurd is also known for being the father of the Norse Viking hero and legendary king of Denmark and Sweden, Ragnar Lodbrok. According to &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauds&quot;, there was once a saga on Sigurd Ring, but this saga is now lost.

==&quot;Hervarar saga&quot;==
The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; tells that when the Danish tributary king Valdar died, his son Randver became the king of Denmark, while his older brother Harald Wartooth took royal titles in Gautland. Then Harald subjugated all the territories once ruled by his maternal grandfather Ivar Vidfamne (Sweden, Denmark, Curonia, Saxony, Estonia, Gardarike, Northumberland). After Randver&#x27;s death in battle in England, his son Sigurd Ring became the king of Denmark, presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd Ring and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir (Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd Ring ruled Denmark until his death and was succeeded by his son Ragnar Lodbrok. Harald Wartooth, however, had a son called Eysteinn Illruler who ruled Sweden until he was killed by Björn Ironside, a son of Ragnar Lodbrok.

==&quot;Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot;==
In &quot;Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot;, Ring (mostly mentioned without the name element Sigurd) is the paternal nephew of the Danish king Harald Wartooth, and presumably (the part of &quot;Sögubrot&quot; where this would have been narrated expressly has not been preserved) the son of Randver, who in his turn is the son of Harald&#x27;s mother Auðr the Deep-Minded and her husband king Raðbarðr of Gardariki. Harald Wartooth was beginning to feel old, so he made Ring the king of Uppland, with the commission to rule Sweden and Västergötland. When Harald reached the extraordinary age of 150, he desired to die like a king in battle, and therefore challenged Ring to meet him in the field. Ring gathered manpower from Sweden, Västergötland and Norway and marched his troops by land and sea to the plain of Brávellir beneath the forest of Kolmården, close to the Bråviken bay. There he was met by the multi-ethnic army of Harald, and the colossal Battle of Brávellir followed. In the end Ring beat his uncle, who was bludgeoned to death in the desperate fighting, and became the ruler of Denmark as well. He put an jarl in charge of Skåne and made a shieldmaiden the ruler of the rest of Denmark (cf. &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, below).

Sigurd Ring (as he is now called in the text) married Alfhild, the daughter of King Gandalf Alfgeirsson of Alfheim (modern Bohuslän) and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. As Sigurd grew old, distant parts of his realm began to secede, and it is told how he lost territory in England due to old age. A certain Adalbrikt (Æthelberht) took possession of Northumbria and was succeeded by his sons Ama and Ælla. One day, Sigurd was in Västergötland and was visited by his in-laws, the sons of Gandalf. They asked him to join them in attacking king Eysteinn of Vestfold in Norway. In Vestfold, there were great blóts held at Skiringssal. Unfortunately, &quot;Sögubrot&quot; (meaning the &quot;fragment&quot;) ends there. However, the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; is believed to be the original story on which &quot;Sögubrot&quot; is based and it continues the story (see below).

==&quot;Olaf Tryggvason&#x27;s saga&quot; ==
According to the &quot;extended Saga of Olaf Tryggvason&quot;, Sigurd Ring, after having stabilized his Swedish-Danish realm, recalled the lands in England once ruled by Harald Wartooth and Ivar Vidfamne. This territory was now ruled by Ingjald (Ingild), a brother of King Peter of Wessex and a mighty ruler in his own right. Ring therefore summoned the leiðangr and sailed to the west, reaching Northumbria. As Ingjald learned about the invasion, he gathered an army. In the ensuing battle, Ingjald and his son Ubbe (Eoppa) fell with a large part of their army. Ring now subordinated Northumbria and made Olaf Kinriksson tributary king. He was a grandnephew of Moald Digra, the mother of Ivar Vidfamne. Ring sailed back to his Nordic kingdom and Olaf reigned for a long time. Then, however, Eava (Eafa), the son of Ubbe, claimed the kingdom. Olaf was defeated and fled to his suzerain in Svíþióð. As compensation, Ring installed Olaf as sub-king in Jutland. As such he served Ring and later Ragnar Lodbrok. His descendants Grim, Audulf and Gorm (I) the Childless also ruled in Jutland. Gorm I adopted the foundling Knud, whose son Gorm II was the foster father of Hardeknud I, ancestor of the later Danish kings. The saga refers to names found in Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies, ancestors of Ecgberht, King of Wessex.

==&quot;Ad catalogum regum Sveciæ annotanda&quot; (&quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;)==
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; tells that Sigurd Ring was married to Alfhild, the daughter of king Alf of Alfheim, and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. Unfortunately, Alfhild died. When Sigurd Ring was an old man, he came to Skiringssal to take part in the great blóts. There he spotted a very beautiful girl named Alfsol, and she was the daughter of King Alf of Vendel (Vendel). The girl&#x27;s two brothers refused to allow Sigurd to marry her. Sigurd fought with the brothers and killed them, but their sister had been given poison by her brothers so that Sigurd could never have her. When her corpse was carried to Sigurd, he went aboard a large ship where he placed Alvsol and her brothers. Then, he steered the ship with full sails out on the sea, as the ship burnt.

Ragnar Lodbrok succeeded his father, but put a subking on the throne of Sweden, king Eysteinn Beli, who later was killed by Ragnar&#x27;s sons.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
According to &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 7), by Saxo Grammaticus, Ring was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald and the maternal nephew of the Danish king Harald Wartooth. His father Ingjald had ravished the sister of Harald, resulting in an indecisive spate of warfare. In the end Harald accepted the abduction in order preserve the friendship with Ingjald. Ring fought with Harald Wartooth in the Battle of the Brávellir and became the overlord of Denmark as well. He appointed his cousin Ale the Strong as sub-king in Skåne while entrusting the shieldmaiden Hetha with the rest of the Danish lands. Saxo then describes the different subkings and their adventures. Fourteen Danish kings later, in book 9, Saxo presents a Sigurd Ring as &quot;Siwardus, surnamed Ring&quot;. This king, however, bears no resemblance to the victor of Brávellir. Rather, he is the son of a Norwegian chief Sigurd and the maternal grandson of the historical King Götrik (i.e. Gudfred, d. 810). Backed by the men of Zealand and Skåne, he fights a civil war against his cousin Ring. As the two rivals join battle, they both fall. Sigurd Ring is the father of Ragnar Lodbrok who has been brought up in Norway during the civil war, but is now hailed as Danish ruler.

==Other sources==
According to &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;, Sigurd Ring is the son of Randver, the uterine brother of Harald Wartooth. Randver is the son of Raðbarðr while Harald is the son of Hrærekr slöngvanbaugi.

In the part of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; called the &quot;Saga of Harald Fairhair&quot;, Harald Fairhair learns that the Swedish king Erik Eymundsson had enlarged Sweden westwards, until it reached the same extent as it had during king Sigurd Ring and his son Ragnar Lodbrok. This included Romerike, Westfold all the way to Grenmar, and Vingulmark.

In &quot;Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s saga&quot;, it is mentioned that Sigurd Ring and Harald Wartooth fought in the Battle of the Brávellir and that Harald fell. After the battle Sigurd Ring was the king of Denmark, and he was the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.

&quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot; only states that Ring was the king of Sweden and Denmark, and the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.

In &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauds&quot;, it is only said that Sigurd Ring, the father of Ragnar Lodbrok fought with Harald Wartooth at the Battle of the Brávellir where Harald died. It adds that there was a saga on Sigurd Ring (which today no longer exists).

According to the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, Harald Wartooth had made all the countries down to the Mediterranean pay tribute. However, when he went to Sweden to demand tribute, the Swedish king Ring met him at the Battle of the Brávellir, and Harald lost and died. Ring made a shieldmaiden the ruler of Denmark (cf. &quot;Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot;, above).

&quot;Gríms saga loðinkinna&quot; and the younger version of &quot;Orvar-Odd&#x27;s saga&quot; only mention Sigurd Ring in a few lines relating to the Battle of the Brávellir with Harald Wartooth.

In &quot;Norna-Gests þáttr&quot;, it is said that Sigurd Ring was very old when he sent his son-in-law, the son of Gandalf, to request the Gjukungs, Gunnar and Högne to pay tribute. This was promptly refused. The sons of Gandalf then asked Sigurd Ring to help them fight against the Gjukungs and their renowned ally Sigurd Fafnisbani. Sigurd Ring could not help them in person, as he was busy fighting against ravaging Curonians and &quot;Kœnir&quot;. Battle was joined in Holstein but turned into a defeat for the Norse army, since Sigurd Fanisbane made the Norse champion Starkad flee in panic.

==Historical origins==
It has been suggested that a report of a struggle for the Danish crown may have given rise to the legend of Sigurd Ring. Following the death of Hemming in 812, a civil war broke out between his brother or cousin Sigifridus and Anulo. This Anulo was the nephew or grandson (&quot;nepos&quot;) of an earlier king Harald. The rivals fought a battle for the succession in which both were killed. The names Sigfred and Sigurd were often conflated in medieval texts. As for Anulo, the name might originally represent Old Norse Ánleifr or Áli, though it was misunderstood by medieval Scandinavian chroniclers as Latin &quot;annulus&quot; which means ring. Saxo Grammaticus and some other medieval compilers of king lists clearly combine the names Sigfred/Sigurd and Anulo/Ring into one person, having received knowledge of 9th century historical events from the chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075). Their historical successor Ragnfred (r. 812–813) is mixed up by Saxo with the Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok, who is identified as the son of Sigurd Ring. The Danish list of early Viking Age kings is therefore in part a High Medieval construction.

One possibility is thus that the struggle of 812 is reflected in the legendary Battle of the Brávellir, fought by Sigurd Ring, nephew of Harald Wartooth. Other scholars have suggested that the original name of the ruler was Ring, that he was a historical king of the Swedes, and that he won a battle against a Danish or East Geatic host in the 8th century. Still others regard the battle as mythical or purely legendary. Modern Swedish historians are skeptical to the prospects of establishing a chronology from the information of the High Medieval saga literature, and generally decline to discuss the possible historicity of Sigurd Ring or the Brávellir battle.

The name Ring occurs in the royal Swedish clan in the Viking Age, since the ecclesiastic chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075) says that a ruler in the first half of the 10th century bore that name.

<doc id="888754" wikidata="Q812801" url="?curid=888754" title="BeIA">
<text>BeIA (BeOS for Internet Appliances) is a discontinued operating system for embedded systems, developed by Be Inc. from 2000 to 2001. It was a minimized version of their BeOS operating system and was developed for the x86 and PowerPC architectures.

The BeIA system presents a browser-based interface to the user. The browser was based on the Opera 4.0 code base, but most of times it featured built-in dashboard (like Sony eVilla), and was named Wagner. Unlike the BeOS, which runs the Tracker and Deskbar at boot-up, the BeIA OS boots straight into the Opera browser interface (only on Compaq IA-1, similar as the later ChromeOS does with the Google Chrome browser). While it is possible to boot BeIA into an interface similar to the standard BeOS, doing so involves special knowledge.

During 2001, a Zanussi &quot;internet fridge&quot; toured the US with a BeIA powered DT-300 webpad docked in its door.

BeIA was discontinued after Be Inc&#x27;s assets were sold to Palm, Inc., with BeIA not able to help the company&#x27;s financial situation and the failure of the Sony eVilla.

==Compression techniques==
The BeIA operating system employs a number of techniques to minimise the system footprint. These involve a number of pre processes which yield an installable file system image.

The Compressed File System (CFS) was a file system created in house at Be Inc that aimed to compress the files within itself to save space. The filesystem had a similar set of properties to the native BeOS file system BFS, but some of the more advanced features (live queries and attributes) were either broken or non-functional in many of the Beta releases of the software.

The BeOS uses ELF format executable files, much as many other operating systems. BeIA uses an extended version of ELF, the name of which is unknown but which has come to be known as CELF, from the &quot;CEL&quot; magic word within the executable header and the fact that it is derived from ELF format executables through a compression process. The CELF (Compressed ELF) files use a patented technique to compress the op codes within the executable and reduce the overall footprint of each executable file. The file was compressed by creating a set of dictionaries that contain the op codes and are read by the kernel at start up and mapped into the executable in memory at run time. This makes the file fast loading, but has an extreme disadvantage, in that the dictionary is not extendible by the user and adding extra executable was not possible when using CELF compression techniques unless the executable symbols existed within the dictionary already present. The creation of CELF executables is generally done in batch. The entire system will be compressed and a file system image created from the crushed files.
Crushing was the term coined for the compression of the system using CELF format. BeIA can run either as CELF or ELF based. However, it can only use one or the other file formats.

==Version history==
The following BeIA versions were released to developers at stages of the development of the system:
==List of BeIA devices==
* Sony eVilla - sold as a home web terminal with BeIA preloaded
* Compaq IA-1 - sold with either BeIA or MSN Companion.
* HARP - not a computer, but a standard for audio streaming terminals, used by Virgin in some of their stores
* Proview iPAD (PI-520B)
* DT Research DT-300 (NB. DT-325 was used with later 2.0 betas)
* First International Computer Genesis 2000
* Hardware known to run BeIA (official and unofficial)

<doc id="888757" wikidata="Q879088" url="?curid=888757" title="Björn at Haugi">
<text>Björn at Haugi (&quot;Björn at the Barrow&quot; from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning mound), Björn på Håga, Björn II or Bern was, according to &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, a Swedish king and the son of Erik Björnsson, and Björn ruled together in diarchy with his brother Anund Uppsale. Björn at Haugi is sometimes identified with the historically attested Björn, a local Swedish ruler mentioned in the 9th-century &quot;Vita Ansgarii&quot; by Rimbert.

==The account of the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;==
The Hervarar saga is an Icelandic work from the 13th century. At the end of a saga, a short chronicle of the Swedish kings from Ivar the Wide-Fathoming to Philip (d. 1118) has been appended, where Björn at Haugi is mentioned:
 
This account dates king Björn to the first half of the 9th century, as his nephew Eric Anundsson was the contemporary of Harald Fairhair. &quot;Landnámabók&quot; mentions a Swede named Þórðr knappr who was one of the first settlers in Iceland and whose father was called Björn at Haugi. Moreover, Björn and his court skald Bragi the Old are mentioned also in &quot;Skáldatal&quot;, where a second court skald also is mentioned, Erpr lútandi.

The Icelandic scholar Jón Jóhannesson has argued that Björn at Haugi may in fact have been a petty ruler in Norway around the late 9th century, and is consequently &quot;not&quot;, as often hypothesized in older history writings, the same person as the Swedish king &quot;Bern&quot; (Björn) in the Vita Ansgarii who ruled around 829-830. The more original version of the Landnámabók seems to have contained two passages which associate Björn with persons from Sogn and Halogaland. Though evidence is not conclusive, Jóhannesson suggests that later tradition moved Björn from Norway (possibly Trondelag) to Svithiod due to certain legendary associations, or even since he had Swedish ancestry. The Icelanders may also have known about the Swedish Björn via the chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), and assimilated him with the king in &quot;Skáldatal&quot; and &quot;Landnámabók&quot;.

<doc id="888760" wikidata="Q409435" url="?curid=888760" title="U.S. Route 34">
<text>U.S. Route 34 (US 34) is an east–west United States highway that runs for from north-central Colorado to the western suburbs of Chicago. Through Rocky Mountain National Park it is known as the Trail Ridge Road where it reaches an elevation of , making it one of the highest paved through highways in the United States. The highway&#x27;s western terminus is Granby, Colorado at US 40. Its eastern terminus is in Berwyn, Illinois at Illinois Route 43 and Historic US 66.

U.S. Route 34 becomes a toll road for a short distance in Colorado, where it passes through Rocky Mountain National Park.

==Route description==
===Colorado===
In the state of Colorado, U.S. Route 34 runs north from Granby through Rocky Mountain National Park. It passes through Estes Park, Loveland, and Greeley before entering Nebraska east of Wray.

Within Rocky Mountain National Park US 34 is known as Trail Ridge Road. Due to its high elevation through the park and over the Continental Divide, Route 34 closes entirely in winter from the Colorado River Trailhead on the west (10 miles north of the Grand Lake entrance) to Many Parks Curve on the east (8 miles from the Estes Park entrance.) Closure runs roughly from mid-October to Memorial Day weekend in May, and can occur at any time in summer due to high alpine snow storms.

Route 34 transverses Fall River Pass and Milner Pass in the Front Range of Colorado.

===Nebraska===

In the state of Nebraska, U.S. Route 34 is a major east–west arterial surface road along the southern portion of Nebraska. It enters Nebraska west of Haigler and overlaps other routes for the majority of its routing. U.S. 34 passes through Hastings, Grand Island, Seward, and Lincoln before entering Iowa between Plattsmouth and Bellevue.

U.S. Route 34 from between Hastings and Grand Island is known as the Tom Osborne Expressway, which is named for the former Hastings resident, Nebraska Cornhuskers football coach, and Congressman. In Lincoln, U.S. 34 overlaps with Interstate 180 from its junction with Interstate 80 into downtown where it becomes North 9th/North 10th Streets, then east as &quot;O&quot; Street. Also, the segment from the Lancaster County/Cass County border to Nebraska Highway 1 south of Elmwood is the Bess Streeter Aldrich Memorial Highway, after the former author and Elmwood resident.

===Iowa===
In the state of Iowa, U.S. Route 34 is a major east–west arterial surface road across southern Iowa. It enters Iowa west of Glenwood and then passes through Glenwood, Red Oak, Corning, and Creston before intersecting Interstate 35 at Osceola. East of Osceola, it continues through Chariton and Georgetown then onto Albia before meeting U.S. Route 63 at a traffic circle in Ottumwa.

East of Ottumwa to Burlington, the highway overlaps Iowa Highway 163. This segment of highway is an expressway with some freeway segments. As of November 12, 2008, it bypasses Fairfield and then bypasses Mt. Pleasant, with a portion of this also concurrent with US-218 and Iowa 27, which is also the Iowa route for the Avenue of the Saints. It then continues southeast towards Burlington bypassing New London and then Danville and Middletown. The freeway segment through Burlington was completed in the 1970s. It then crosses the Mississippi River on the Great River Bridge into Illinois which was completed in the early 1990s. In 2015, a 15-mile segment of U.S. Route 34 in Montgomery and Adams counties won the Sheldon G. Hayes Award for the highest quality asphalt pavement in the nation.

Much of this route was originally known as the Bluegrass Highway and parallels tracks of what was originally the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad and is now the BNSF. Amtrak&#x27;s California Zephyr passenger rail service also parallels this route.

U.S. 34 in the state of Iowa is officially designated the Red Bull Highway in honor of the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division.

===Illinois===

In the state of Illinois, U.S. Route 34 enters at the Mississippi River across from Burlington, Iowa. It passes through or around the cities of Monmouth, Galesburg, Kewanee, Princeton, Mendota, Yorkville, Oswego, Aurora, Naperville, Lisle, Downers Grove, Westmont, Clarendon Hills, Hinsdale, Western Springs, La Grange, Brookfield, Lyons and Riverside and continues in a largely southwest-northeast direction to its eastern terminus at Illinois Route 43 and Historic US 66 in Berwyn. Through much of the Chicago area, the highway is known as &quot;Ogden Avenue&quot;, after William Butler Ogden, Chicago&#x27;s first mayor. The entire highway in Illinois is named the Walter Payton Memorial Highway after Pro Football Hall of Famer Walter Payton, who wore #34 for the Chicago Bears. The highway is 211.37 miles (340.17 km) long within the state.

<doc id="888762" wikidata="Q4354288" url="?curid=888762" title="Seasonal human migration">
<text>Seasonal human migration is the movement of people from one place or another on a seasonal basis. It occurs most commonly due to seasonal shifts in demand for labor. It includes migrations such as moving sheep or cattle to higher elevations during summer to escape the heat and find more forage. Human labor often moves with fruit harvest or to other crops that require manual picking.

==Seasonal agricultural migration==
While the culture of many crops (especially &quot;dry&quot; crops) has become entirely mechanized, others, such as fruits and vegetables, still require manual labor, at least for harvest, and some, such as tobacco, still need manual labor for its culture. Much of the work was once provided by family members or boarding students, but they are less available now, and farms are larger. Now, migrant workers provide much of the hand labor required in agriculture in the US and other countries. Labor contractors arrange with farmers to provide the necessary help at the seasonal time, often with foreign nationals whose employment opportunities are more limited in their home areas.

A number of migratory contractors, known as &quot;custom harvesters&quot;, move with their combines to follow the wheat harvest in the United States and Canada. as the season moves north. Some crop dusters are also migratory, following seasonal patterns of need. In the large citrus districts of Florida and California seasonal pickers arrive for collection periods and often move with the changing harvest.

Most commercial beekeepers in the US are migratory, spending winter in warm climates and moving with the spring to follow the bloom, or pollination contracts for almonds, apples, blueberries and other fruits and vegetables that require bees. Migratory beekeeping also is practiced, especially in France, Australia, South Africa and Argentina.

== Seasonal non-agricultural migration ==
Other activities besides agriculture depend on weather. Thus circuses in the United States formerly spent the winter in warm climates and worked their way north in spring and south in autumn. Boomer linemen similarly served the telephone industry, repairing winter storm damage. 
Some researchers suggest that snowbirds, Canadian and US citizens who move to warmer climates during the winter, exhibit patterns of seasonal migration. Although they are moving for non-agricultural reasons, they move with the seasons. For example, many residents of Ontario, Canada move to Florida, US during the winter. The practice actually dates back to colonial times, when Bostonians of means would often go (by sea) to Charleston or Savannah for winter. Later, the wealthy in the growing country maintained several seasonal residences and shifted residence with the seasons, to avail themselves of the best time to be at each location, and they named their time there &quot;the season&quot;. In British India, Ceylon and Malaya, the cooler hill stations became the place of residence for Europeans during the hot summers, and Simla became the summer capital of the British Raj.

<doc id="888763" wikidata="Q7843397" url="?curid=888763" title="Triple Fast Action">
<text>Triple Fast Action (sometimes stylized as tripl3fastaction) was an indie rock/alternative rock band started by Wes Kidd and Brian St. Clair, both previous members of Chicago band Rights of the Accused, in 1995. Kidd went on to manage such bands as Cheap Trick, The Damnwells and bandmate Kevin Tihista while working for New York–based Silent Partner Management. St. Clair joined the band Local H after stints as tour manager for Chicago&#x27;s Liz Phair and served as drum tech for Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick. Triple Fast Action member Kevin Tihista released several of his own solo albums after the band&#x27;s breakup.

Triple Fast Action was one of many Chicago area acts signed to Capitol Records during the multi-year label frenzy that also snatched up the Smashing Pumpkins, Smoking Popes, Fig Dish, Loud Lucy, Veruca Salt, Red Red Meat, Certain Distant Suns, Liz Phair, The Lupins, Hum, Seam, Menthol, Urge Overkill, Stabbing Westward and Cupcakes among others. The band supported such notable acts as Everclear, Lenny Kravitz, The Wallflowers and Veruca Salt over the course of its existence. The band&#x27;s first release, &quot;Broadcaster&quot;, was referred to as &quot;Cheap Trick meets Nirvana&quot; and featured power-pop two-toned guitar crunch and a stunning power backbeat. The album sold poorly despite extensive touring in the U.S. due to limited label support.

The group left Capitol and signed with the then-NY-based indie label of John Szuch&#x27;s (now based in Charlotte, NC) Deep Elm Records (Nada Surf, Brandtson, Pave the Rocket and Camber) to release the critically acclaimed &quot;Cattlemen Don&#x27;t&quot;. The first single, &quot;Heroes&quot; received some college radio airplay and won several nights of local WKQX FM&#x27;s battle of the songs. A farewell concert was performed at Chicago&#x27;s Metro on May 24, 1998.

Notable fans of the band include Dave Grohl of Nirvana/Foo Fighters, who lists a show of Rights of the Accused as his first concert. Grohl and fellow Foo Fighters listened repeatedly to the band&#x27;s &quot;Broadcaster&quot; during their recording of &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;. Wes Kidd made several demos available to fans and friends via home-burned CD.

<doc id="888773" wikidata="Q2903131" url="?curid=888773" title="Bill Bradley (baseball)">
<text>William Joseph Bradley (February 13, 1878 – March 11, 1954) was an American third baseman and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). He recognized as one of the best third basemen in baseball prior to 1950, along with Jimmy Collins and Pie Traynor.

==Career==

Bradley made his professional debut on August 26, 1899 with the Chicago Orphans. After playing for two seasons in Chicago, Bradley moved to Cleveland to play for the newly formed American League. He spent the next decade with the Cleveland franchise, his best season coming in 1902 when he had a batting average of .340, 12 triples, and 11 home runs. After the 1910 season, Bradley spent three seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League before returning to the Federal League in 1914, playing for the Brooklyn Tip-Tops that year and the Kansas City Packers the following year.

He led American League third basemen in fielding four times, setting a league record of seven putouts in one game in both 1901 and 1909. Bill Bradley was the first Cleveland baseball player to hit for the cycle on September 24, 1903. In he hit home runs in four straight games and finished the year with a .340 batting average.

After finishing his playing and managing career in the Federal League, Bill Bradley was a scout for the Cleveland Indians. He was elected to the Indians&#x27; Hall of Fame shortly after his death in 1954. Bradley died in Cleveland at the age of 76 due to pneumonia. He was laid to rest at Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.

<doc id="888778" wikidata="Q409449" url="?curid=888778" title="U.S. Route 35">
<text>U.S. Route 35 (US 35) is a United States Highway that runs southeast-northwest for approximately from the western suburbs of Charleston, West Virginia to northern Indiana. Although the highway is physically southeast-northwest, it is nominally north–south. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is in Teays Valley, West Virginia, near Scott Depot, at Interstate 64 (I-64). Its northern terminus is near Michigan City, Indiana, at US 20. The West Virginia portion of the highway is mostly expressway, becoming a freeway shortly before it crosses the Ohio River into Ohio. The Ohio portion has been upgraded to a four-lane highway/freeway between the West Virginia state line and Trotwood, west of Dayton.

==Route description==
US 35 is signed north-south in West Virginia and Indiana, while in Ohio it is signed east-west.

===West Virginia===
As of November 11, 2021, the final West Virginia portion of the highway has been expanded to four lanes, mostly along a completely new route.

In Putnam County, the roadway that becomes US 35 is a short, four-lane, divided, unsigned US 35 Spur running northward from Teays Valley Road toward I-64 on the edge of Scott Depot in Teays Valley. Remaining on the edge of Scott Depot, and now at the edge of Teays Valley, the roadway reaches US 35&#x27;s southern terminus at its junction with I-64, where the route becomes an expressway.

US 35&#x27;s junction with I-64 is a hybrid semi-directional T/diamond interchange. All movements between US 35 and I-64 are free-flowing, except for eastbound I-64 to northbound US 35. The interchange also handles movements between I-64 and the US 35 spur similar to a diamond interchange.

Proceeding north from I-64, US 35 has two intersections, followed by an interchange with West Virginia Route 34 (WV 34). There follow a number of intersections along the route, with one being an indirect connection to WV 817, the former path of US 35. The next major junction is WV 869, which travels across the Kanawha River on the Lower Buffalo Bridge (often referred to as the &quot;Buffalo Bridge&quot;), connecting via WV 62 to the town of Buffalo and the nearby, large Toyota engine and transmission plant. The route continues as an expressway.

At WV 2, which leads to Point Pleasant, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with six ramps; all movements are free-flowing except for northbound US 35 to southbound WV 2, and from southbound WV 2 to southbound US 35; the interchange is partially in Henderson. At this point, US 35 becomes a freeway and remains so, as it immediately crosses the Ohio River on the Silver Memorial Bridge, and enters Ohio.

===Ohio===

US 35 is signed east-west in Ohio, an exception to the numbering scheme for US Highways, which calls for odd-numbered routes to be signed north-south, as is US 35 in West Virginia and Indiana.

Continuing as a freeway, US 35 crosses the Ohio River from West Virginia on the Silver Memorial Bridge, and enters Gallia County, Ohio. The first, partial interchange, providing a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance, is with State Route 7 (SR 7), just outside the village of Gallipolis. Just after that, still, outside the village, the highway passes adjacent to the Gallia–Meigs Regional Airport within Gallipolis; there is another partial interchange, providing an eastbound left exit and a westbound left entrance to SR 735, which connects to SR 7.

From there, US 35 continues west, where there is a hybrid interchange with an unusual configuration at SR 160. SR 160 roughly parallels US 35 to the south; there is a westbound exit to SR 160 north which uses a flyunder ramp, an eastbound entrance from SR 160 south, and an eastbound entrance from SR 160 north. Additionally, another fly under ramp from SR 160 north merges with the westbound exit ramp; that exit ramp, in turn, splits to form an entrance ramp to westbound US 35. This interchange lacks an eastbound exit. As SR 160 turns north, it diverges from US 35, which travels somewhat northwest. There, US 35 once again meets SR 160, this time at a partial interchange with an eastbound exit and a westbound loop ramp entrance.

Turning more west-northwest, there is an interchange at SR 850 (Rodney Pike), followed by a rest area in each direction. Approaching the edge of Rio Grande, the route turns west and then west-southwest, where there is an interchange at SR 325.

Past the village, the highway travels northwest and becomes a four-lane, at-grade expressway when it reaches the Gallia County village of Centerville; here there is an intersection with SR 279 west.

Traveling north-northwest and northwest into Jackson County, the expressway configuration continues until SR 327, where there is a grade-separated, one-quadrant interchange, with the connecting road in the southeast quadrant of the junction. The road resumes as an at-grade expressway, approaching and then skirting the edge of Jackson.

The route then reaches a grade-separated, right-in/right-out interchange; westbound there is a right-in/right-out at Keystone Furnace Road; eastbound there is a right-in/right-out at McCarty Lane; these roads are connected via Industry Drive and Acy Avenue, which overpasses US 35.

Next, there is an unusual interchange configuration at SR 32/SR 124, which is an expressway in both directions. Each highway has ramps that exit to the other highway, with traffic merging onto the second highway, but traffic coming to an intersection. Both highways end up having intersections, albeit with grade separation of the main highway corridors. This interchange type is sometimes termed a &quot;windmill&quot; interchange, but it is not related to the interchange type of the same name. This junction is the only interchange of its type known to exist in the world.

Soon after passing the last interchange and still skirting Jackson, the highway once again becomes a freeway and has an interchange at Pattonsville Road/Broadway Street. Turning briefly north, then northwest, the route leaves Jackson and reaches an interchange with SR 93. It next has an interchange with Jackson County Road 84 (Chillicothe Pike).

After the last interchange, the highway becomes an at-grade expressway for about . Along this section, there is a rest area next to the westbound lanes but accessible from both directions, with additional access via Cain Road (Jackson Township Road 213).

US 35 then turns roughly west, entering Ross County and reaching an interchange with Vigo Road/Watson Road at Richmond Dale. At this point the route again becomes a freeway. Turning north and northwest, the section between Richmond Dale and Chillicothe includes a large cut through a ridge and provides westbound motorists with a panoramic view of the Scioto River valley.

Southeast of Chillicothe, westbound US 50 joins US 35 in a concurrency at a hybrid interchange; similar to a diamond interchange, the exit ramp from US 35 east carrying US 50 east becomes a two-way road, curves around and crosses over US 35 about east; the other ramps connect to this overpass. Next, US 50 west leaves the concurrency at a partial interchange at Eastern Avenue; there is only a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance. Then, the US 23 north freeway joins US 35 in a concurrency at a partial-Y interchange; there is an eastbound exit and a westbound left entrance.

Turning north-northwest, US 35 skirts Chillicothe to the east, coming to an interchange at Main Street. Turning northwest, the US 23 north freeway leaves the concurrency at a partial-Y interchange; there is a westbound exit and an eastbound left entrance.

Turning west and skirting through city boundaries, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with five ramps at SR 159 (Bridge Street); there is a loop ramp from northbound Bridge Street and a directional ramp from southbound Bridge Street to westbound US 35. Travelers eastbound near this interchange can see the hills that are shown on the Great Seal of the State of Ohio.

Turning northwest, just outside the city limits, there is an interchange at SR 104 (High Street). The next, partial interchange, is at Pleasant Valley Road/Egypt Pike with a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance (via Larrick Lane). Continuing along, there is an interchange at Ross County Road 550/Pleasant Valley; despite this junction being a regular service interchange, it is configured as a hybrid trumpet interchange. Next is an interchange at Ross County Road 87, near Frankfort. Continuing, there is an interchange at SR 138.

Entering Fayette County, the road turns west-northwest, bypassing south of Washington Court House. The next major junction is with I-71 near Jeffersonville; rather than have a direct interchange, each freeway indirectly connects to the other via interchanges with SR 435.

As the route continues through flat farmlands, it enters Greene County, bypasses north of Jamestown and south of Xenia.

Past the Xenia bypass, the road reverts to an at-grade expressway. From a bit east of Orchard Lane in Beavercreek Township to a bit west of Factory Road in Beavercreek, the route has a superstreet configuration.

US 35 once again returns to freeway status at the North Fairfield Road interchange in Beavercreek. It next has a full-access interchange with I-675, also in Beavercreek.

Several miles later, in Montgomery County, the road opens into a three-lane highway (with five lanes in some parts) each way through downtown Dayton. Turning west, the highway has a full-access interchange with I-75 in downtown Dayton. Past I-75, the route becomes an expressway, with a mix of interchanges and at-grade intersections.

After entering Drexel, just west of Dayton, the highway turns north. At the border with Trotwood, the route turns due west on West Third Street/Eaton Pike; the roadway that had carried US 35 continues as SR 49, an at-grade expressway also known as the &quot;Northwest Connector&quot; or as the &quot;Trotwood Connector&quot;. The roadway carrying US 35, now two lanes and undivided, travels through New Lebanon as Main Street.

US 35 then enters Preble County and travels through West Alexandria as Dayton Street. The route next proceeds to Eaton; after passing through downtown as Main Street, the route turns northwest onto Eaton Richmond Pike (Main Street continues as SR 122). The highway travels toward I-70 near New Paris, widens to four lanes as it approaches SR 320, turns north and briefly becomes four lanes undivided, then reduces to single-lane ramps and merges with the Interstate at a partial interchange. Running concurrently with I-70, US 35 travels approximately to the Indiana state line.

===Indiana===
US 35 enters Wayne County, Indiana concurrent with I-70 and passes north of Richmond, before splitting off on the northwest side of Richmond. US 35 then travels in a northwesterly path as a winding two-lane highway, passing through agricultural land, and through intersections with State Road 38 (SR 38), SR 1 and, in Randolph County, US 36. The highway then passes through a corner of Henry County, with no major junctions.

In Delaware County, the highway reaches the edge of the city of Muncie, where it merges with SR 3 and SR 67 as a four-lane expressway. The expressway heads north, skirting the east side of Muncie, passing over the White River and through interchanges with Memorial Drive in unincorporated Center Township and SR 32 in Muncie. Continuing along the east edge of Muncie, there is a right-in/right-out intersection in both directions with East Centennial Avenue and an intersection with East McGalliard Road. Northeast of Muncie, at the border of unincorporated Center Township and Hamilton Township, there is an intersection with East Riggin Road. Shortly thereafter, SR 67 splits off the expressway at an interchange, followed by a partial interchange with Old State Road 3, leading back into Muncie. Soon after the expressway ends, with the roadway becoming a two-lane highway.

Near the town of Royerton, US 35 turns west onto SR 28, toward I-69, as SR 3 continues north. After a short overlap with SR 28, US 35 turns north onto I-69.

US 35 overlaps I-69, passing into Grant County, through an interchange with SR 26, to SR 22, where US 35 leaves I-69 and heads west on SR 22 to travel through the cities of Gas City and, in Howard County, Greentown. Just east of Kokomo, US 35 turns north onto the US 31 freeway. It overlaps US 31 for only , to a partial interchange where it splits off, heading west as a two-lane roadway. US 35 passes just north of a Chrysler manufacturing plant before an intersection with SR 931, the former route of US 31. The roadway briefly widens to a four-lane divided highway at a partial interchange with Davis Road, which connects from Kokomo. US 35 leaves the Kokomo area heading northwest into Cass County, toward Logansport.

As US 35 nears Logansport, the roadway becomes a four-lane expressway, just prior to its intersection with US 24. The expressway bypasses Logansport to the south as part of the Hoosier Heartland Highway. There is a northbound (westbound) exit to Monticello Road, the former routing of these highways. Northbound US 35 and westbound US 24 exit the Hoosier Heartland Highway at a split diamond interchange and run concurrently along the interchange&#x27;s westbound frontage road, having a very short overlap with SR 25 (southbound US 35 and eastbound US 24 run concurrently along the eastbound frontage road, also overlapping SR 25). US 35 and US 24 then turn northwest from the frontage road onto another expressway on the west edge of Logansport. Along the roadway, there is an intersection with the aforementioned Monticello Road and a two-quadrant interchange with Old State Road 25. After crossing the Wabash River, the overlapped routes have a final interchange where US 24 exits heading due west, while US 35 continues north-northwest.
Soon after US 24 leaves US 35, US 35 narrows back to a two-lane road and travels through the town of Winamac, in Pulaski County. Once in Starke County, the route travels through the town of Knox. In Davis Township, near Hamlet, the US 30 expressway provides an interchange. After entering LaPorte County, US 35 travels to the community of South Center in Union Township; there it turns west on US 6 (the US 35 roadway continues north as South County Road 300 E). The route next turns north-northwest until it leaves the concurrency with US 6 northward in Washington Township, near Kingsbury. Turning northwest, US 35 travels through the city of La Porte; in northwestern La Porte, an intersection with SR 39 provides access to the Indiana Toll Road/I-80/I-90. US 35 next crosses under the Indiana Toll Road with no direct interchange access, in unincorporated Center Township. Farther northwest, US 35 has its northern terminus where it meets US 20 in Springfield Township, just east of an interchange with I-94, near Michigan City.

====Logansport issues====
Logansport area residents, the sheriff&#x27;s department and at least one transportation expert have voiced concerns about the split diamond interchange used on the Logansport section of the Hoosier Heartland Highway. From the interchange&#x27;s opening in October 2013 through February 28, 2016, there had been 71 two-vehicle crashes at or near the interchange, 53 of those at the interchange&#x27;s four intersections, two fatalities, and a number of injuries. Possible causes for the accidents include drivers&#x27; unfamiliarity with this type of interchange, which is typically built in cities, and is not common in semi-rural small towns; drivers&#x27; mistaking the frontage roads for entrance ramps and not stopping when required; the complexity of four major traffic routes converging on one interchange; ramp/frontage traffic controlled by stop signs alone, with cross-traffic not having to stop; stop signs not clearly visible at the crest of the exit ramps. In response in 2014, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) added signage, placed flashing lights on the stop signs, and installed rumble strips. These steps reduced, but did not eliminate the problems, with one of the fatalities taking place after these fixes. INDOT was planning by spring 2016 to add overhead flashers, move the stop signs to more visible positions, install channelizing islands and increase overhead intersection lighting.

==History==
===West Virginia===
Originally, US 35 was routed from Charleston, West Virginia, on the north side of the Kanawha River (the current WV 62) to Point Pleasant until the collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1967. When the new Silver Memorial Bridge was completed in 1969, US 35 was moved to the south side of the river (the former WV 17) away from Point Pleasant, and its southern terminus was in St. Albans, West Virginia, at the junction of US 60.

Before funding was made available to convert US 35 to an expressway, a possibility had been put forward that the route would have been completed as a toll road.

Prior to June 15, 2009, US 35 was relocated onto a new four-lane, mostly at-grade, expressway alignment running from I-64 in Teays Valley to a point about before the Lower Buffalo Bridge, for a length of . On that date, the old segment of US 35 between US 60 and the Lower Buffalo Bridge was signed as WV 817.

Prior to July 2011, the expressway segment of US 35 between Beech Hill, near the junction with WV 817 north, and near Henderson was completed, tying into some older expressway segments in the Henderson area and crossing the Silver Memorial Bridge. This had an approximate total length of .

The remaining section of two-lane roadway from about before the Lower Buffalo Bridge to Beech Hill, near the junction with WV 817 north, was completed and opened to traffic on November 11, 2021. This section had a $174 million contract awarded on June 2, 2015 for its completion. The section was tentatively to have been completed by fall of 2019, but the West Virginia Department of Transportation originally extended the completion date to August 2021, but then that was delayed to November 11, 2021. The speed limit for all of US 35 within West Virginia is 65 mph.

===Ohio===
Before the adoption of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the route in Ohio was known in its entirety as SR 11. By 1966, the first freeway portion of the route began construction, comprising the Chillicothe bypass.

Freeway portions on the east side of Dayton and south side of Xenia were completed by 1971, and around Washington Court House by 1974.

Before 1988, westbound traffic on US 35 west of I-75 in Dayton turned north along Williams Street, then was routed along West Third Street (eastbound traffic on West Third Street turned south on Broadway Street back to US 35); on October 25, 1996, a new expressway alignment through west Dayton, known as the &quot;US 35 West&quot; project, was completed. This portion of the route in Dayton west of I-75 is designated the &quot;C. J. McLin Jr. Parkway&quot;, in honor of the late state representative who advocated for and worked toward the construction of &quot;US 35 West&quot;.

The portion of US 35 from Drexel to SR 320 is the only two-lane, undivided section of the route remaining in Ohio. US 35 is a major Appalachian Development Highway System Corridor linking I-70 and points west to I-64 and points east.

The portion of the route within Gallia County is designated the &quot;Bob Evans Highway&quot;, in honor of the restaurateur and pork sausage marketer who spent most of his life in the county.

The portion of the route between Gallipolis and Jackson is designated as part of the Welsh Scenic Byway by the Ohio Department of Transportation, celebrating Welsh immigrants who settled in southeastern Ohio during the 19th century.

The interchange at North Fairfield Road in Beavercreek opened on October 25, 2003. As part of the project, the existing ramp from State Route 835 (Research Boulevard) to westbound US 35 was removed, with the area converted to wetlands, and part of the pavement used as a connection to a regional rail trail.

The section between Richmond Dale and Chillicothe was upgraded to a freeway in 2005.

On August 26, 2015, the at-grade intersection with Keystone Furnace Road and McCarty Lane at the Jackson–Lick Township line was converted into a right-in/right-out interchange.

In November 2021, the stretch of road from Orchard Lane in Beavercreek Township to Factory Road in Beavercreek was converted to a superstreet configuration, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation.

===Indiana===
The first signed road along the what would later become US 35 was SR 35, which ran from west of Jonesboro and Kokomo, and SR 15 from Burlington to Michigan City. In 1926 state road numbers were changed; SR 35 became SR 18 and SR 15 became SR 29. Many changes took place in 1930 along what would later become US 35, the first of which was a state road proposed between SR 38, near Richmond, and Muncie. This was followed by SR 21 being added to the state road system between Muncie and St. Anthony, and a state road being proposed between St. Anthony and SR 9 west of Jonesboro. The last change in 1930 was a proposed state road between Kokomo and Burlington.

Between late 1930 and early 1932 SR 21 was added to the state road system between SR 38 and Muncie and between St. Anthony and Jonesboro. At the same time SR 18 became SR 22 and was extended east through Jonesboro and west to Burlington. Also during this time frame a state road was proposed between Kokomo and Logansport. In late 1932 or early 1933 SR 21 was paved between Richmond and Muncie and SR 22 was paved between Kokomo and Burlington.

US 35 was first designated in the state of Indiana in 1935, US 35 was routed from the Ohio state line, near Richmond, to Michigan City, via Muncie, Kokomo, Burlington and Logansport, along SR 21, SR 22 and SR 29. At this time the Indiana State Highway Commission authorized the addition of SR 17 between Kokomo and Logansport. The construction on the authorized segment of SR 17 began between 1939 and 1941, with the construction being completed by 1942. US 35 was rerouted away from Kingsbury between 1942 and 1945, with the old route through the town becoming SR 829.

The multi-lane road of US 35 from US 6 to La Porte opened either in 1951 or 1952. The US 35 designation was rerouted onto SR 3 and SR 28 between Munice and St. Anthony between 1956 and 1957. The old route of US 35 became locally maintained roads and streets. The bypass of Jonesboro was completed in either 1965 or 1966, and US 35 was routed along it from SR 15 to the west; east of SR 15 was signed as only SR 22. In 1967 or 1968 US 35 was rerouted onto SR 28, I-69, and SR 22 from St. Anthony to Jonesboro. The old route of US 35 became county roads or city streets.

By 1970 US 35 was rerouted onto US 31 (now SR 931) to bypass downtown Kokomo. US 35 was rerouted onto SR 3 to bypass downtown Muncie between 1972 and 1973. By 1974 US 35 was rerouted away from downtown Logansport on the a bypass around the south and east sides of the city. The US 35 designation in Richmond was moved onto I-70 between 1997 and 1999.

In October 2008 the Indiana Department of Transportation and the City of Michigan City came to an agreement for the city to assume maintenance of the segment of US 35 from the US 20/SR 212 interchange to US 12. The city did so in October 2009, and the former segment of US 35 became known as Michigan Boulevard. INDOT submitted an application in October 2008 to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to extend the decommissioning of US 35 to include the entire portion of the roadway from the east junction with US 20, through the US 20/SR 212 interchange, to US 12. INDOT still had signage, however, that indicated US 35 overlapped US 20 to the US 20/SR 212 interchange, which was not corrected until 2019.

New bypass roads in Kokomo and Logansport opened in 2013 and US 35 was rerouted along both new roadways.

<doc id="888779" wikidata="Q6761695" url="?curid=888779" title="Maria Del Mar (singer)">
<text>Maria Morales (born ), known professionally as Maria Del Mar, is a Canadian rock singer.

She was the lead vocalist of the 1980s and 1990s rock band National Velvet.

==Early life==
Del Mar was born in Spain, where she lived until 18 months of age. As a child she danced in Spanish cultural shows and enjoyed holding public singing performances in her neighbourhood. At the age of 15, she dropped out of high school and moved to Vancouver. She later worked as a cigarette girl at Toronto nightclubs, such as RPM and The Copa. She also worked as a coat-check girl at The Diamond, where fellow National Velvet band member, Tim Welch, once worked as well.

==Career==
Del Mar met bassist Mark Storm in 1984 in a Toronto alleyway outside of party, where the two had a heated discussion about music. Storm asked Del Mar to be a backing vocalist in the band that he was part of at the time. The following year Del Mar and Storm formed National Velvet along with drummer Gary Flint, and guitarists Mark Crossley and Tim Welch.

Del Mar was noted for her energetic performances and goth-like image. She had a powerful presence, bolstered by her height, and was often dressed in black, sometimes in leather, with jet-black hair. She would dance wildly, often kicking into the air, sometimes climbing into the audience. Del Mar&#x27;s strong, deep, vocal style was compared to artists such as Patti Smith, Carole Pope, Siouxsie Sioux and Nina Hagen. Journalists referred to her by such descriptions as a &quot;raven-haired vamp&quot;, &quot;Amazonian vamp&#x27;, &quot;gothic Cher&quot;, &quot;post-goth vampirella&quot; and &quot;6-foot-tall dominatrix.&quot;

Del Mar provided backing vocals on the track &quot;Blonde in the Bleachers&quot;, a Joni Mitchell cover song featuring the musician, Squiddly, from the 1992 tribute album &quot;Back to the Garden&quot;. After National Velvet&#x27;s dissolution, Del Mar joined the all-female indie rock band, Hässenpfeffer. In 1996 they released the album, &quot;Songs of Convenience&quot; on the label MaGaDa Int&#x27;l.

Del Mar is sometimes confused with Canadian television and film actress Maria del Mar who was in the cast of the Canadian television series &quot;Street Legal&quot;, a popular series whose original run coincided with National Velvet&#x27;s tenure. Del Mar (the vocalist) also played a role in the 1991 film &quot;The Events Leading Up to My Death&quot;, furthering the confusion.

<doc id="888782" wikidata="Q1434538" url="?curid=888782" title="Chapare Province">
<text>Chapare (, also called The Chapare, is a rural province in the northern region of Cochabamba Department in central Bolivia. Most of the territory consists of valley rainforests that surround the area&#x27;s main waterway, the Chapare River, which is also a tributary of the Amazon River. The provincial capital is Sacaba, 11 km east of Cochabamba. Its principal town is Villa Tunari, a popular tourist destination.

In recent decades, the Chapare province has become a haven for illegal cultivation of the coca plant, which can be used to produce cocaine. This is due to Bolivian drug law, which until recently only permitted the Yungas region to legally grow coca, despite Chapare being a historical area for growth due to its fertility. For this reason, Chapare has been a primary target for coca eradication in recent years, with frequent and heated clashes between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Bolivian cocaleros. The law has since been changed by a deal that was struck between Evo Morales (a former coca activist and the country&#x27;s first indigenous President (2006-2019)) and former President Carlos Mesa. This deal permits the region to grow a limited amount of coca every year .

== Subdivision ==
Chapare Province is divided into three municipalities which are further subdivided into cantons.

<doc id="888788" wikidata="Q7805499" url="?curid=888788" title="Time trialist">
<text>A time trialist is a road bicycle racer who can maintain high speeds for long periods of time, to maximize performance during individual or team time trials. The term &quot;cronoman&quot;, or &quot;chronoman&quot;, is also used to refer to a time trialist.

==Details==
In a traditional individual time trial, riders set off alone (not in a group or peloton) at intervals, typically anything from one to five minutes, and try to complete the course in as short a time as possible. In order to maximize the overall speed a time trialist must be able to maintain a steady effort throughout the event, of which the best measure is believed to be the rider&#x27;s power at lactate threshold (LT) or aerobic threshold (AT). The best time trialists (such as Miguel Indurain, David Millar, Ellen van Dijk, Tony Martin, Tom Dumoulin and Fabian Cancellara), are believed to have very high power output at LT/AT, which they can then maintain for the duration of the time trials.
To be a successful time trialist, a cyclist must have exceptional aerodynamic posture and be able to take in plenty of oxygen. Aerodynamic performance can also be improved by riders using &#x27;skin suits&#x27;, overshoes and streamlined helmets.

Bike technology is also important in time trials. By using aerodynamic components, a bicycle can be designed to minimize its drag coefficient, allowing a rider to drop their time by minutes during a long course.

Time trials may also form individual stages of stage races. By incorporating time trial specialists into a cycling team, the team can lower its aggregate time dramatically.

In relatively flat mass-start stages and races, time trialists often work as domestiques for their team leaders, or participate in breakaways. Some riders who are primarily time-trialists have also been able to compete in everything but the steepest climbs because of their good power-to-weight ratio. Tour de France winners Miguel Indurain, Jan Ullrich and Bradley Wiggins were primarily time-trialists but were also among the best in the mountain stages during the years in which they won the Tour de France. Likewise, Tom Dumoulin was able to win the 2017 Giro d&#x27;Italia by defending the lead he had built in the individual time trial in subsequent mountain stages.

<text>Cairnpapple Hill is a hill with a dominating position in central lowland Scotland with views from coast to coast. It was used and re-used as a major ritual site for around 4000 years, and in its day would have been comparable to better known sites like the Standing Stones of Stenness. The summit lies 312 m above sea level, and is about 2 miles (3 km) north of Bathgate. In the 19th century the site was completely concealed by trees, then in 1947–1948 excavations by Stuart Piggott found a series of ritual monuments from successive prehistoric periods. In 1998, Gordon Barclay re-interpreted the site for Historic Scotland. It is designated a scheduled ancient monument. 

==History==
Neolithic rituals began about 3500 BC with signs of small hearths, and precious objects left on the hill, presumably as offerings, including fine pottery bowls and stone axe heads imported from Cumbria and Wales.

Probably around 3000 BC a Class II henge was constructed with the hilltop being surrounded by a bank outside a ditch about wide cut over into the rock, with wide entrances from north and south. Inside this an egg-shaped setting of 24 uprights (thought to have been timber posts, or possibly standing stones) enclosed an inner setting of similar uprights.

Some time later a Bronze Age ritual added a small stone and clay cairn just off-centre inside the monument, with a high standing stone to the east and a setting of smaller stones. Also aligned to this cairn were sockets for three upright stones at the centre of an arc of seven small pits, six of which contained cremated bones and two contained remains of bone skewer pins. Under the cairn traces were found of at least one burial, with wooden objects (perhaps a mask and club) and beaker people style pottery which indicates a date around 2000 BC.

This cairn was later covered by a second much larger cairn about across and several yards (metres) high, with a kerb of massive stone slabs, which incorporated Bronze Age burial cists, one of which contained a food vessel pot. Subsequently, more stone was brought in to increase this cairn to about diameter, enclosing two cremation burials in inverted urns and now covering the original ditch and bank, making the whole site a tomb monument. Lastly, inside the ditch to the east four graves considered Iron Age are now thought to be early Christian because of their east-west alignment, and are dated to around 500 to 1000. Hilderston in the valley to the east was the site of a large but short-lived mining operation following the discovery of silver in 1606.

==Present day==
The site is open to the public April to September and has a small visitor centre. The 1940s excavations have been partly covered by a concrete dome replicating the second cairn (although the dome is much higher than the cairn) so that visitors can go inside what was once a solid cairn and see the reconstructed graves, and outside this the surrounding post holes and graves are marked by being filled with colour-coded gravel like an archaeological plan, with the red gravel indicating upright pits, and the white gravel denoting the alleged Christian burials. The current display attempts to show all the main phases of the site at the same time.

Cairnpapple Hill is the 445th highest Marilyn (sub 2000&#x27; peaks) in Scotland (Out of 571 total Marilyns) - the true top is to the south beside a trig point.

==Derivation of the name==
Although there is still some confusion about the origin of the name Cairnpapple Hill, or the alternative &quot;Cairniepapple&quot;, its meaning can be guessed to a certain extent. It is uncertain whether the name comes from a Brythonic language, related to Welsh; a Goidelic one, such as Scottish Gaelic; or a mixture of the two. The first part, &quot;cairn-&quot; means cairn, either from Brythonic (e.g. Welsh &quot;carn&quot;) or Goidelic (e.g. Gaelic &quot;càrn&quot; or &quot;càirn&quot;). The second part &quot;-ie-&quot;, means &quot;of the&quot;, as in Welsh &quot;y&quot; or Gaelic &quot;a&quot;&#x27;. The third part is the most problematic, possibly meaning any of &quot;tent&quot; (Welsh &quot;pabell&quot;, Gaelic &quot;puball&quot;), &quot;people/congregation&quot; (Welsh &quot;pob(o)l&quot;, Gaelic &quot;pobull&quot;), or even &quot;eye&quot; (compare Old Welsh &quot;pubell&quot;). Thus, &quot;Cairniepapple&quot; is most likely to mean &quot;Cairn of the tent&quot;, &quot;Cairn of the people&quot;, or &quot;Cairn of the eye&quot;.

<doc id="888793" wikidata="Q449571" url="?curid=888793" title="Rabih Abou-Khalil">
<text>Rabih Abou-Khalil (, born August 17, 1957) is an oud player and composer born in Lebanon, who combines elements of Arabic music with jazz, classical music, and other styles. He grew up in Beirut and moved to Munich, Germany, during the Lebanese Civil War in 1978.

==Musical style==
Abou-Khalil studied the oud at the Beirut conservatory with oudist Georges Farah. After moving to Germany, he studied classical flute at the Academy of Music in Munich under Walther Theurer.

In his compositions and live concerts, he combines elements of Arabic music with jazz, rock, or classical music, and has earned praise as &quot;a world musician years before the phrase became a label&quot;. — According to a review of his concert in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 2002, Abou-Khalil &quot;makes the hot, staccato Middle Eastern flavour and the seamless grooves of jazz mingle, as if they were always meant to.&quot;

In a review of his 2007 album &quot;Songs For Sad Women,&quot; the BBC wrote &quot;the characteristic blend of jazz-inflected Arabic melody with subtle rhythms combines into a hypnotic whole, as ever with Abou-Khalil’s fluent oud playing in a central role.&quot;

Along with Tunisian oud virtuosos Anouar Brahem and Dhafer Youssef, he has helped establish the oud as an important instrument of Ethno jazz and world fusion.

Among other musicians, Abou-Khalil has worked with ARTE Quartett (saxophone quartet), Alexander Bălănescu (violin), Luciano Biondini (accordion), Milton Cardona (conga), Sonny Fortune (alto saxophone), Michel Godard (tuba and serpent), Joachim Kühn (piano, alto saxophone), Howard Levy (harmonica), Charlie Mariano (alto saxophone), Gabriele Mirabassi (clarinet), Glen Moore (bass), Mark Nauseef (percussion), Setrak Sarkissian (darabukka), Ramesh Shotham (Indian percussion), Steve Swallow (bass), Glen Velez (frame drum, percussion), or Kenny Wheeler (flugelhorn).

==Albums==
His only album for the Munich-based label ECM was called &quot;Nafas&quot; (1988). Since 1990, his albums have been published by Enja Records, Munich. For &quot;Al-Jadida&quot; (1992), Abou-Khalil invited alto saxophonist Sonny Fortune; &quot;Blue Camel&quot; (1992), featured alto saxophonist Charlie Mariano and flugelhorn player Kenny Wheeler. &quot;Morton&#x27;s Foot&quot; (2004) presents Luciano Biondini on accordion and Sardinian singer Gavino Murgia. &quot;Journey to the Centre of an Egg&quot; (2005) features a trio of oud, piano (Joachim Kühn, who doubles on alto saxophone) and Jarrod Cagwin on drums.

&quot;Nafas&quot; and &quot;Tarab&quot; make use of the ney, the Middle Eastern end-blown flute. &quot;Arabian Waltz&quot; features Abou-Khalil&#x27;s compositions for string quartet (performed by the Balanescu Quartet), along with oud, Michel Godard on tuba or serpent, and frame drums.

In 2008, Abou-Khalil released an album entitled &quot;Em Português&quot; (&quot;In Portuguese&quot;), where he mixes fado with Arabic music with the participation of the fadista Ricardo Ribeiro.

==TV series: Visions of Music==
In 1998, Rabih Abou-Khalil hosted the television series &quot;Visions of Music&quot;. This 13-part documentary series produced by EuroArts Entertainment set out to explore the blending of jazz with different music styles of the world (Caribbean salsa, Brazilian samba, Argentine tango, French musette, Spanish flamenco, Jewish klezmer, New Orleans R&amp;B and Mississippi blues, as well as West African, South African, Indian, and Middle Eastern music) through historical footage and interviews with musicians by Abou-Khalil. The music of the TV-series was released on the album &quot;Visions of Music - World Jazz&quot; by Enja Records.

<text>The Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ; Quebec Labour Congress) is the third biggest trade union in Quebec, Canada, by membership.

It was founded in 1946 when three earlier unions merged to form the &quot;Corporation générale des instituteurs et institutrices catholiques de la province de Québec&quot; (CIC; General Corporation of Catholic Teachers in the Province of Quebec). Léo Guindon was its first president.

It changed its name in 1967 to &quot;Corporation des enseignants du Québec&quot; (Quebec teachers corporation), and then again in 1974 when it officially became a labour union to &quot;Centrale des enseignants du Québec&quot; (CEQ; Quebec teachers labour congress). It finally became the &quot;Centrale des syndicats du Québec&quot; in 2000 to acknowledge the fact that its membership base had expanded beyond teaching profession.

Today over 100,000 of its 175,000+ members are education workers, working primarily in the public sector. Most (69%) of its members are women. The CEQ was the first Quebec trade union to appoint a woman (Lorraine Pagé) as its president, in 1988.

Louise Chabot has been president since 2012 and Marc Nantel, Line Camerlain and Pierre Jobin are 1st, 2nd and 3rd vice presidents. Daniel B. Lafrenière is the secretary-treasurer.

Centrale des syndicats du Québec currently acts as a liaison for the J. W. McConnell Family Foundation as well.

It is a member organization of Education International and Public Services International.

<doc id="888801" wikidata="Q409462" url="?curid=888801" title="U.S. Route 36">
<text>U.S. Route 36 (US 36) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway that travels approximately from Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado to Uhrichsville, Ohio. The highway&#x27;s western terminus is at Deer Ridge Junction, an intersection in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, where it meets US 34. Its eastern terminus is at US 250 in Uhrichsville, Ohio.

== Route description ==
===Colorado===
US Route 36 begins at US 34 at Deer Ridge Junction in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, just west of Estes Park. It then passes through Boulder and Denver on its way to Kansas. Between Boulder and Denver, the road that is now US 36 was originally built as the &quot;Denver-Boulder Turnpike&quot;. It serves today as a major arterial freeway in the Front Range Urban Corridor. Between Denver and Byers, US 36 exists in unsigned overlaps with I-270 and I-70, while some parts of its original route are signed separately as Colorado State Highway 36 (SH 36). After it diverges from I-70 in Byers, US 36 is a relatively lightly-traveled two-lane rural highway to the Kansas state line.

===Kansas===

US-36 passes through all 13 counties in Kansas which border Nebraska. The highway enters the Sunflower State from Colorado in Cheyenne County, and leaves the state by crossing the Missouri River on the Pony Express Bridges entering Missouri.

The section of US-36 from Washington, Kansas to St. Joseph, Missouri is officially called the &quot;Pony Express Highway&quot; because it marks the starting section of the Pony Express. It crosses the Missouri River on the Pony Express Bridges. From the western junction with K-383 to the Missouri state line, US-36 is part of the National Highway System.

Except for wider sections in towns and passing lanes on hills, US-36 through Kansas is mostly a two-lane surface road. However some of the principal intersections all along the road are grade-separated diamond interchanges. From the Little Blue River just west of the K-148 junction to the US-77 North junction just west of the Big Blue River at Marysville, US-36 is a four-lane divided surface highway. From Hiawatha to west of Wathena, the road is a two-lane freeway. After passing through Wathena as a surface street (Riverside High School in Wathena fronts the westbound lanes), it becomes a four-lane freeway to the Missouri state line.

===Missouri===

US 36 across Missouri is a four-lane expressway with some freeway sections, passing through or near St. Joseph, Cameron, Chillicothe, Brookfield, Macon, Monroe City and Hannibal. Between I-35 in Cameron and the Illinois state line, it runs concurrently CKC (Route 110) and forms part of the principal route between Kansas City and Chicago. Just prior to crossing the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge, US 36 also encounters the western terminus of I-72 and all three routes run concurrently into Illinois.

===Illinois===
In the state of Illinois, US 36 runs concurrently with much of I-72. It enters from Missouri across the Mississippi River on the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge, and runs east with the concurrency with the CKC (IL 110) ending when IL 110 diverges to follow I-172. US 36/I-72 then continue eastward, crossing I-55 in Springfield. At the US 51 bypass in Decatur, US 36 leaves I-72 and runs due east through downtown Decatur. US 36 then continues east, through Tuscola and several smaller communities, to the Indiana border.

===Indiana===

US 36 enters Indiana near Dana in Vermillion County. It then passes through the towns of Montezuma, Rockville, Bainbridge, Danville, and Avon before approaching Indianapolis. US 36 then joins I-465, traveling around the south side of the city (counter-clockwise in the eastbound direction). East of the city, US 36 exits onto Pendleton Pike and travels northeast. It passes through Lawrence, McCordsville, and Fortville before passing around the east side of Pendleton, where the route turns east. The route then travels mostly in a straight line, passing through Sulphur Springs, Losantville, Modoc, and Lynn before entering Ohio.

The former routing through Indianapolis consisted of Rockville Road, Washington Street, West Street/Michigan Road (the latter once Northwestern Avenue, now Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street), 38th Street, and Pendleton Pike.

===Ohio===
US 36 enters Ohio in Darke County near the small village of Palestine, after which it passes through Darke, Miami, Champaign, Union, Delaware, Knox, and Coshocton counties before reaching its terminus at Uhrichsville in Tuscarawas County. It travels concurrent with US 127 in Greenville for about . Within the state, US 36 is classified as 83.1% rural and 16.9% urban with only coded as freeway (out of total). It also travels concurrent with US 33 in Marysville for about . The Birthplace of Rutherford B. Hayes, 19th President of the United States, 17 E. William St., Delaware, is on the north side of US 36, approximately west of the US 23 overpass. The home was demolished in 1926 and the location is marked with a historical monument.

<text>3554 Amun is an Aten asteroid, meaning it crosses Earth&#x27;s orbit, and a Venus-crosser. It was discovered on 4 March 1986 by Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker at Mount Palomar Observatory, and named for the ancient Egyptian deity Amun. Amun was the fifth Aten asteroid to be numbered.

Photometric observations of 3554 Amun during 2017–2018 were combined to determine a rotation period of 2.53029 hours. It has been classified as an M-type asteroid in the Tholen taxonomy, X-type in the Bus taxonomy, and C-, X-, and D-type in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy. The featureless optical spectrum has a similar slope to the Tagish Lake meteorite, although 3554 Amun is not considered the source. The infrared spectrum of 3554 Amun was found to match a D-type asteroid taxonomy. The estimated diameter is 3.341 kilometers, making it one of the smallest known asteroids to have an M-type classification.

Amun was once considered metallic, based on an M-type optical spectrum. In &quot;Mining the Sky&quot;, planetary scientist John S. Lewis calculated the purported value of a metallic 3554 Amun at $20 trillion. (6178) 1986 DA is another M-type near-Earth asteroid with lower inclination that is actually metallic.

Amun passes close to Venus, and in 1964, 2034, and 2103 comes within 10 Gm of it.

<text>Norman Arthur &quot;Kid&quot; Elberfeld (April 13, 1875 – January 13, 1944) was an American professional baseball shortstop. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies (1898), Cincinnati Reds (1899), Detroit Tigers (1901–1903), New York Highlanders (1903–1909), Washington Senators (1910–1911), and Brooklyn Robins (1914). Elberfled also managed the New York Highlanders for the last half of the 1908 season.

Elberfeld was given the nickname &quot;the Tabasco Kid&quot; because of his fiery temper. He was known for his ferocious verbal, and sometimes physical, assaults on umpires. On one occasion, while in the minors, Elberfeld threw a lump of mud into the umpire&#x27;s open mouth. Later in his career, Elberfeld assaulted umpire Silk O&#x27;Loughlin and had to be forcibly removed by police; Elberfeld was suspended for just 8 games. Records show he was tossed from a major league game 22 times as a player and 4 times as a manager.

==Early career==
Elberfeld broke into organized baseball in 1892 in Clarkson, Tennessee. He was so highly regarded as a prospect that a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies recommended signing him over another shortstop prospect, Honus Wagner (a Hall of Famer). Elberfeld played only 14 games for the Phillies in 1898 before being sent to the Detroit Tigers, then a minor league team in the Western Conference. A year later, Elberfeld was purchased from Detroit by the Cincinnati Reds. Elberfeld lasted only 41 games in Cincinnati.

==Detroit Tigers: 1900–1903==
Prior to the 1900 season, the Reds sent Elberfeld back to Detroit, then still part of the Western League. Elberfeld remained with Detroit when they joined the newly formed American League in 1901. He was the Tigers&#x27; starting shortstop during their first two seasons as a Major League team. In the team&#x27;s debut, on April 25, 1901, the Tigers committed 7 errors, including 3 by Elberfeld. Later in the season, Elberfeld had 12 assists in a game on September 2, 1901. Elberfeld went on to bat .308 (with 76 RBIs and a .397 On Base Percentage) in the Tigers&#x27; inaugural season, becoming the Tigers&#x27; first team batting leader and its first .300 hitter.

In 1902, Elberfeld&#x27;s batting average dropped to .260, but he started the 1903 season on a hitting tear. In June 1903, with Elberfeld hitting .341 for the Tigers, he was traded to the New York Highlanders for Herman Long and Ernie Courtney. Despite his hot hitting, Elberfeld had fallen out of favor in Detroit after being suspended for abusing an umpire. Tiger manager Ed Barrow accused Elberfeld of deliberately throwing games to get himself traded.

==New York Highlanders: 1903–1909==
Elberfeld was with the Highlanders from 1903 to 1909. During that time, he broke the .300 mark only once, batting .306 in 1906. Nevertheless, he was considered an integral part of the Highlanders teams, contributing in many small ways. For example, on May 20, 1907, Elberfeld stole home twice in the same game, the first American League player to accomplish that feat.

Elberfield would become the second Yankee captain after Clark Griffith. He would hold the captaincy from 1906 through 1908. In late June 1908, New York manager Clark Griffith resigned, and Elberfeld took over as the manager. The Highlanders finished the 1908 season, Elberfeld&#x27;s only season as a Major League manager, in last place having gone 27–71 (a .276 winning percentage) under Elberfeld.

==Washington Senators and Brooklyn Robins: 1910–1914==

In December 1909, Elberfeld was sold to the Washington Senators for $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He played two seasons for the Senators before being released. He signed with Montgomery in the Southern League, where he befriended a young Casey Stengel. According to Stengel biographer Maury Allen in his 1979 book, &quot;&#x27;You Could Look It Up: The Life of Casey Stengel&#x27;&quot;, Elberfeld was generous with his time and his wisdom. The grizzled veteran and the 22-year-old youngster sat together on trains, roomed together in hotels, dined together in restaurants, shared thoughts on the bench and talked for hours about baseball. On September 15, 1912, Stengel was called up to Brooklyn. Elberfeld threw a farewell party for Stengel, ordering him to buy a new suit (&quot;You gotta dress like a big leaguer before they believe you are one&quot;, Elberfeld said) for $22.00, and a new suitcase for $17.50. After a long night of drinking, Elberfeld walked with Stengel to the train station, and advised Stengel: &quot;Keep your ears open and your mouth shut up there.&quot; Stengel went on to be known as much for his mouth as for his baseball talent.

Elberfeld returned briefly to the Major Leagues in 1914, where he played with the Brooklyn Robins.

==Player profile==
Aside from his temper, Elberfeld became known as one of the best shortstops in the early years of the twentieth century. He was known as a tough competitor who challenged baserunners to slash him out of their way. On May 1, 1908, Elberfeld was severely spiked in the foot by Bob Ganley‚ essentially ending his season. During Ty Cobb&#x27;s rookie season, Cobb slid headfirst into second base, only to have Elberfeld dig his knee into the back of Cobb&#x27;s neck, grinding his face in the dirt. According to a Cobb biographer, the incident marked the last time that Cobb would slide headfirst into a base. Shortly before his death, Elberfeld was quoted as saying &quot;Ty found out my feet were harder than his head. Then he started coming in spikes first. I had to protect myself.&quot; 
Elberfeld&#x27;s legs were badly scarred from years of high-flying spikes, and it was reported that he poured raw whiskey into spike wounds to cauterize them.

Further showing his toughness, Elberfeld led the American League in times hit by a pitch in 1903 and 1911, and was among the league leaders in the category nine times. In 1911, he was hit by a pitch 25 times, setting an American League record that was not broken until 1986 when Don Baylor was hit 35 times. In his career, Elberfeld was hit 165 times, 13th on the all-time list.

Despite 458 errors at the shortstop position, Elberfeld had great range in his early years. In 1901, he made 332 putouts and had a range factor rating of 6.14 – 87 points higher than the league average for shortstops. He also recorded a career-best 459 assists at shortstop the following season with the Tigers. Elberfeld collected 12 assists in a single game in 1901. As injuries and age slowed him down, Elberfeld&#x27;s range was more limited later in his career.

==Minor league manager and retirement==
Elberfeld remained active in major and minor league baseball for 30 years. From 1915 to 1917, Elberfeld managed the Chattanooga Lookouts, then went on to the Little Rock Travelers, where he managed for several years, winning a pennant in 1920. While managing the Travelers, Elberfed met a 14-year-old Travis Jackson. Elberfeld observed Jackson in an impromtu workout, and later signed Jackson to his first professional contract.

Early in his baseball career, Elberfeld bought an apple orchard on Signal Mountain, near Chattanooga. Elberfeld built his home and raised a family of five daughters and a son on Signal Mountain. His daughters formed a basketball team that played as &quot;The Elberfeld Girls&quot; and appeared on many Southern programs for several years. Elberfeld lived at his Signal Mountain home until his death in 1944.

<doc id="888819" wikidata="Q1237356" url="?curid=888819" title="Domestique">
<text>In road bicycle racing, a domestique is a rider who works for the benefit of their team and leader, rather than trying to win the race. In French, &quot;domestique&quot; translates as &quot;servant&quot;. The use of the term dates back to 1911, although such riders had existed before then.

==Theoretical basis==
Much of a cyclist&#x27;s effort is to push aside the air in front of them. Riding in the slipstream of another rider is easier than taking the lead. The difference increases with speed. Racers have known this from the start and have ridden accordingly, often sharing the lead between them. From there it is a small step to employing a rider to create a slipstream while their leader rides behind them.

More complicated tactics become possible as the number of domestiques available increases (&quot;see below&quot;). Where the domestique finishes a race is less important than the help he gives. During their role as domestiques, riders do not share the fame of their respective leaders, such as Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, or Miguel Induráin.

Many domestiques have ultimately gone on to achieve fame of their own, however. Lucien Aimar, who supported Jacques Anquetil, won the 1966 Tour de France. Greg LeMond won the 1986 Tour de France after being Bernard Hinault&#x27;s domestique in the 1985 Tour de France, as did Jan Ullrich in 1997 after riding for Bjarne Riis in 1996, Chris Froome in 2013 after riding for Bradley Wiggins in 2012, and Jonas Vingegaard, who scored second place at the Tour in 2021 before ultimately going on to win in 2022 and 2023 after being domestique for Primož Roglič in 2020.
The writer Roger St Pierre said:

==First domestiques==
The first riders known to have been employed to help a leader were Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban. They rode in the 1907 Tour de France for Henri Pépin, who promised them the equivalent of first prize if they would pace him from restaurant to restaurant. The three never hurried. They took 12 hours and 20 minutes longer than Émile Georget on the stage from Roubaix to Metz – they were far from last – and the judges were powerless because the race was decided not on time but points. It mattered less what speed riders competed than the order in which they crossed the line. In an era when riders could be separated by hours, there was no point in hurrying after a rival who could not be caught and passed. The judges had to wait for everyone.

The rules of the Tour in its first decades forbade team riding, but Pépin did little to affect the result. He dropped out on stage five.

==Terminology origin==
The word was first used in cycling as an insult for Maurice Brocco, known as Coco, in 1911. Brocco started six Tours de France between 1908 and 1914, finished none of them, although a stage he won in 1911 caused the coining of &quot;domestique&quot;. Brocco&#x27;s chances in 1911 ended when he lost time on the day to Chamonix. Unable to win, the next day he offered his services to other riders, for which he had a reputation. François Faber was in danger of being eliminated for taking too long and the two came to a deal. Brocco waited for Faber and paced him to the finish. Henri Desgrange, the organiser and chief judge, wanted to disqualify him for breaking the rules. But he had no proof and feared Brocco would appeal to the national cycling body, the Union Vélocipédique Française. He limited himself to scorn in his newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, writing: &quot;He is unworthy. He is no more than a &quot;domestique&quot;.&quot;

Next morning Brocco greeted Desgrange with: &quot;Today, &quot;monsieur&quot;, we are going to settle our accounts.&quot; He won the day by 34 minutes. Desgrange followed him and the yellow jersey, Gustave Garrigou, as they climbed the Tourmalet. &quot;So, am I forbidden to ride with him?&quot; Brocco shouted. On the following mountain, the Aubisque, he dropped Garrigou, passed Paul Duboc, who had been poisoned and was in agony beside the road, and took the lead with Émile Georget. Desgrange was still watching. &quot;Alors, quoi&quot;, Brocco shouted, &quot;do I have the right to stay with him?&quot; And then he rode off alone and won. He had made two points to Desgrange. The first was that he was a talented rider and not a servant. The second was that he had so much talent that his poor riding with Faber could only have been through a commercial arrangement. Desgrange replied that any rider with such flair had clearly been selling the race. &quot;He deserves his punishment&quot;, Desgrange wrote, &quot;immediate disqualification.&quot;

Domestiques had long been accepted in other races. Desgrange believed the Tour should be a race of individuals and fought repeatedly with the sponsors, bicycle factories, who saw it otherwise. Desgrange got rid of the factories&#x27; influence only by reorganising the Tour for national teams in 1930, with the effect that he thereby acknowledged teamwork and therefore domestiques.

==Devoted domestiques==
The dominant climber of the 1950s, Charly Gaul, was followed for as long as he could last by Luxembourger Marcel Ernzer. The two men were of similar size and rode bikes of exactly the same dimensions, even though that made Ernzer a little low in the saddle. He was always there to give his bike to Gaul when it was needed.

Andrea Carrea was a domestique for Fausto Coppi. &quot;He was a &quot;gregario&quot; par excellence&quot;, said the journalist Jean-Luc Gatellier, &quot;the incarnation of personal disinterest ... showing to perfection the notion of personal sacrifice. He refused the slightest bit of personal glory.&quot; Carrea was riding the Tour de France of 1952 and joined an attack to Lausanne to protect his leader&#x27;s interests.
Carrea said: &quot;Without knowing it, I had slid into the important break of the day and at Lausanne, to my great surprise, I heard I had inherited a jersey destined for champions. For me, it was a terrible situation.&quot;

Carrea had no idea he had become race leader. When officials told him, he burst into tears. He had ousted Coppi and he dreaded the consequences. He wept as he received his jersey, looking constantly down the road for the main field that included his leader.

Jean-Paul Ollivier said: Carrea thought the sky had fallen in. How would Fausto take it? When the champion arrived a few minutes later, Carrea went towards him in tears to offer his excuses. &quot;You must understand that I did not want this jersey, Fausto. I have no right to it. A poor man like me, the yellow jersey?&quot; 

Coppi said: &quot;I wondered how Carrea, so shy and so emotional, was going to take it. When I went to congratulate him on the track at Lausanne, he didn&#x27;t know what face he ought to adopt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;l&#x27;Equipe 13/07 2003&quot;&gt;&quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, 13 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

José Luis Arrieta was a domestique for Miguel Induráin. &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; said: &quot;He no longer counts the hours, the years, spent with his nose in the wind trying to protect his leader for as long as possible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeQ 7/7/7&quot;&gt;&quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, 7 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Arrieta said:

==Types of support==
===Basic support===

Domestiques bring water and food from team cars and shield teammates from opponents. They help teammates with mechanical disasters – should the leader puncture a tire, the domestique will cycle in front to create a slipstream allowing him to reclaim their position. A domestique may also sacrifice his bicycle or wheel.

===Tactical support===
Domestiques race in the interest of the team, or against opposing teams. By putting themselves in a breakaway they force other teams to chase. In turn, they chase a breakaway that threatens their team.

Domestiques lead out sprinters by letting them &#x27;draft&#x27; behind to conserve energy until the last few hundred meters. The lead-out train sometimes starts 10–15 km to the finish with up to eight domestiques setting a pace to discourage others from breaking away. One by one, worn-out teammates drop off. The last to lead a sprinter is often a good sprinter himself. The sprinter will launch into a dash to the line with one or two hundred meters to go.

In mountainous races, domestiques help their leaders by setting a pace or thwarting attacks from others.

==Super-domestique==

There is a hierarchy among domestiques; the more accomplished, often called lieutenants or super-domestiques, are called upon during critical times. The lieutenant stays with the leader as long as possible during demanding periods. For example, Lance Armstrong used teammates Roberto Heras and José Azevedo as climbing domestiques to set pace during mountain stages of the Tour de France before making a decisive attack. Experienced super-domestiques often also have the role of captain, passing on tactical instructions to other riders and making tactical decisions when there is little or no contact with the coaching staff. Examples of traditional super-domestiques are Andreas Klöden with Astana Pro Team and George Hincapie who was a key lieutenant of U.S. Postal Team. Hincapie was also a domestique for Alberto Contador in 2007 and for Cadel Evans in 2011, when both went on to win the Tour.

Recent developments in the compositions of the rosters of leading teams have led to an increasing number of high-status riders fulfilling super-domestique duties, especially during the Grand Tours. This approach was largely originated by Team Sky, beginning with their success at the 2012 Tour de France, where Chris Froome finished second on the overall podium behind his teammate and compatriot Bradley Wiggins. This finish came after some tension between the two lead riders, in particular during Stage 17 of the race, where Froome was forced to wait for Wiggins – his defined team leader – three times on the climb to the summit finish at Peyragudes, allowing Alejandro Valverde to win the stage, while both Wiggins and Froome cemented their overall general classifications standings. Following this, a number of teams have adopted fluid, or shared team leadership at the Tour de France and the other Grand Tours. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 editions of the Tour de France all saw Sky – in 2019, changing sponsorship to become known as – successfully capture the yellow jersey, while a second rider from the team finished elsewhere within the top four: 2017 saw Froome win, with Mikel Landa coming fourth; in 2018, Geraint Thomas won his first Tour de France, while Froome finished third; and in 2019, Egan Bernal, who had himself served as a super-domestique to Froome and Thomas the previous year, subsequently finished first himself, with Thomas finishing second.

This top-heavy strategy has also been a feature of other teams in contention, with mixed results. The for the 2018 and 2019 Tours saw the deployment of the so-called &#x27;Trident&#x27; of Mikel Landa, who had moved from Sky for the 2018 season, alongside long-term Movistar leaders and general classification contenders Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde. This tactic was largely unsuccessful for Movistar, who experienced difficulties in coordinating their three leaders, none of whom appeared willing to sacrifice their own ambitions to serve as super-domestiques for one of the other two.

Comparatively, a more successful and more hierarchical example of the super-domestique system featured at the 2020 Tour de France through having entered the Tour with shared leadership between Tom Dumoulin and Primož Roglič – both of whom were previous Grand Tour winners, alongside high finishes at the Tour de France itself – Dumoulin recognised that he would be unable to maintain his own general classification campaign, and voluntarily assumed a super-domestique role to Roglič. This allowed Jumbo-Visma to operate with similar tactics to those used by Sky/INEOS in previous years, by setting a higher pace throughout difficult climbs, buoyed by the fact that Dumoulin and other Jumbo-Visma support riders such as Sepp Kuss would remain present in breakaways and leaders&#x27; groups to protect Roglič, while the weaker support riders surrounding other contenders would be whittled away. However, their defensive tactics had the unforeseen consequence of Jumbo-Visma helping eventual winner and rival Tadej Pogačar of UAE Team Emirates.

Nonetheless, the traditional domestique role remains an important one, and a 2020 poll of riders in the professional peloton by cyclingnews.com named Tim Declercq as the best domestique in the world, followed by Luke Rowe, Michael Mørkøv, Andrey Amador, Imanol Erviti, Michael Schär and Iljo Keisse.

==Individual glory==

Domestiques sometimes get a chance to win stages in stage racing. Typically this would be late in a stage race. Domestiques whose standings do not threaten the leaders will often not be chased if they break away. Domestiques can progress to more senior roles if they show ability. For example, at the 2012 Tour de France Tejay van Garderen of BMC Racing Team began the tour as a domestique for 2011 winner Cadel Evans but later became team leader due to Evans struggling and eventually won the young rider classification. Chris Froome of Team Sky also won a stage while riding in support of winner Bradley Wiggins, and became team leader the following year, where he eventually won the general classification.

Assigned team roles vary substantially from race to race based on a variety of factors, including the course, the team members riding the race, their current physical condition, or even commercial factors. For instance, Stuart O&#x27;Grady, a veteran professional rider riding for Leopard-Trek, served as a domestique supporting Carlos Sastre in the 2008 Tour de France. By contrast, in the 2008 Herald Sun Tour, a much less-prominent race in which Sastre (and other high-profile members of the team) did not ride, the Australian O&#x27;Grady acted as team leader and was assisted by his teammates to win two stages and the general classification.

==Evolution of the domestique==
The UCI points system changed the relationship between domestiques and leaders. Previously, domestiques were not concerned with their finishing order. However, riders now get points for their finish position. This presses domestiques to also consider their own performance in addition to their leader&#x27;s.
The 1990s saw the introduction of radio communication, allowing managers to assign tasks to domestiques wherever they are on the road. The influence of radios on race tactics is a topic of discussion amongst the cycling community, with some arguing that the introduction of radios in the 1990s has devalued the tactical knowledge of individual riders and has led to less exciting racing. In September 2009, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body of pro cycling, voted to phase in a ban on the use of team radios in men&#x27;s elite road racing. Finally radio found its undisputed place in peloton for good and, as some races with imposed radio ban proved, the ban changed nothing in racing tactics.

== In track cycling ==
In track cycling&#x27;s team pursuit event, a team of four riders must complete 4 km, with the third rider being used to stop the clock. Therefore, one rider often sprints towards the finish line to tow the teammates.

<text>Lanfranco &quot;Frankie&quot; Dettori (; born 15 December 1970), is an Italian jockey who was based in England for a career spanning over 35 years. He was British flat racing Champion Jockey three times (1994, 1995 and 2004) and rode the winners of 287 Group 1 races including 23 winners of the British Classic Races. His most celebrated achievement was riding all seven winners on British Festival of Racing Day at Ascot Racecourse on 28 September 1996.

Born in Milan, Dettori is the son of Italian champion jockey Gianfranco Dettori. At the age of fourteen he went to Newmarket in England to work first as a stable lad, later as apprentice jockey and stable jockey in the yard of Luca Cumani, winning the British champion apprentice jockey in 1989. He was appointed stable jockey for Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s newly founded Godolphin Racing in 1994 and during the next eighteen years rode most of his worldwide big race victories in Godolphin&#x27;s royal-blue colours. In 2000 Dettori and fellow jockey Ray Cochrane survived a light aircraft crash at Newmarket.

At the end of 2012, Dettori split from Godolphin Racing, and was suspended from riding for six months after failing a drugs test in France. From June 2013 to July 2018, he was the retained rider in Britain for Sheikh Joaan Al Thani&#x27;s Al Shaqab Racing. Since then, many of his winners including Enable and Stradivarius have come from the stables of John Gosden. Dettori announced in December 2022 that 2023 would be his final year of professional riding. In December 2023 he moved to California to continue to race in the United States and on the international circuit.

Outside racing he has worked in TV, appearing as a team captain on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; from 2002 to 2004, and opened several Italian restaurants in partnership with chef Marco Pierre White.

==Early life==

Dettori was born in Milan, Italy, on 15 December 1970. His father, Gianfranco Dettori, was a 13 times Italian Champion Jockey, who had won the British 2,000 Guineas in 1975 on the Henry Cecil trained Bolkonski and in 1976 on Wollow, also trained by Cecil. His mother Mara was a circus performer. Soon after his birth, Dettori&#x27;s parents divorced. Until he was five, Dettori and his sister lived with their mother; after that they lived with their father and stepmother. As a child, Dettori was more interested in football than racing, but that changed when he was eight and his father bought him a palomino pony called Silvia. Aged nine, he rode Silvia in the Pony Derby at San Siro racecourse; he came last and fell off after the finishing line.

Dettori left school aged thirteen to work in racing stables and, in July 1985, left Italy for England to work in the yard of trainer Luca Cumani at Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket. It was at first a culture shock, as he had to adapt to a new language, and strange food and drink such as Heinz tinned ravioli and orange squash. Dettori returned to Italy for the winter of 1986/87 and his first win came on Turin racecourse in November 1986.

==Career==
===Early career in Newmarket===

In the spring of 1987 Dettori was back in Cumani&#x27;s yard in Newmarket and started to ride in Britain as an apprentice jockey. His first win in Britain came at Goodwood on 9 June 1987, riding Lizzy Hare to for Cumani. That season he rode eight winners, before spending the winter of 1987/88 in California, employed as a work rider for the trainer Richard Cross. While in California Dettori was taught by jockey Ángel Cordero Jr. how to do a flying dismount, something that would later become his trademark. In 1989 Dettori became champion apprentice jockey with 75 wins and rode his first winner of a group race, Legal Case in the Select Stakes at Goodwood. In the spring of 1990 he took up a position of stable jockey to Cumani. That year he rode eight Group 1 winners for Cumani, and four for other trainers, including Henry Cecil. Markofdistinction provided him with his first win at Royal Ascot in June 1990 and his first Group 1 win in September. Still only nineteen, Dettori became the first teenager since Lester Piggott to win more than 100 races in a season, finishing on a total of 149, fourth in the champion jockey table.

The 1991 and 1992 seasons saw fewer winners as Cumani had lost many of his best horses when major owner the Aga Khan removed his horses from training in England. In 1992 Dettori won the Prix du Jockey Club on Polytain, trained by Antonio Spanu in France, and the Ascot Gold Cup on Drum Taps, trained by Lord Huntingdon. Before the beginning of the 1993 season he lost his position with Cumani, over his failure to let the trainer know that he was considering taking up the offer of a lucrative contract in Hong Kong. By now Dettori was enjoying a party lifestyle and in April 1993 was arrested in London for possession of cocaine, which put paid to his prospective contract to ride in Hong Kong. Dettori was given a police caution for the cocaine offence, after which he concentrated on racing with a renewed dedication, riding 149 winners as a free-lance in 1993. There was a second victory in the Ascot Gold Cup on Drum Taps, and two Group 1 wins on the sprint mare Lochsong, trained by Ian Balding.

===The Godolphin years===
In September 1993, Dettori was signed to ride Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s horses trained by Gosden. Determined to secure the 1994 jockey championship, Dettori took a break in Morocco to get fit for the beginning of the all-weather season in January and get a head start on jockeys who only rode on turf. By the end of the 1994 season, he had ridden 233 British winners and won the first of his three jockey championships. His first British Classic success came in the 1994 Epsom Oaks on Godolphin filly Balanchine, trained by Saeed bin Suroor. Three weeks later the pair won the Irish Derby at The Curragh. In November 1994 Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s Cumani-trained Barathea provided Dettori with the first of his fourteen Breeders&#x27; Cup victories, winning the Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile. When Sheikh Mohammed set up the Godolphin international racing operation in 1994, Dettori, who had already ridden the Sheikh&#x27;s horses in training with Gosden, was signed as retained jockey. The association would last eighteen years.

In 1995,Dettori was again champion jockey. Godolphin horses provided him with two more British Classic victories, Moonshell and Classic Cliche in the St Leger, while Lammtarra won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. His St Leger win also provided him with his 1000th win in Britain.

On 28 September 1996 Dettori achieved a remarkable feat when he &quot;went through the card&quot;, riding all seven winners at the British Festival of Racing (a precursor to British Champions Day) at Ascot racecourse. Dettori&#x27;s 25,095-1 &quot;magnificent seven&quot; made him a household name and cost the betting industry an estimated £40 million. Twenty years later he would refer to it as his greatest sporting achievement.

On 1 June 2000, Dettori and fellow jockey Ray Cochrane were aboard a Piper Seneca plane which crashed on takeoff at Newmarket on its way to Goodwood in Sussex. Cochrane pulled Dettori from the wreckage but was unable to save pilot Patrick Mackey. Dettori suffered a broken ankle and facial cuts and spent several days in Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital

After the plane crash, Dettori devoted less time to racing and more time to TV work on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;. Although still riding successfully in the big races, he had in his own words become a part-timer. It was his wife who encouraged him to get back to riding in the small meetings as well as the major ones, and, in 2004, he won the jockeys&#x27; championship for a third time.

By 2007 Dettori had amassed eleven victories in British Classics (two in the 2000 Guineas, two in the 1000 Guineas, three in the Oaks and four in the St Leger) but a win in the Derby still eluded him after fourteen attempts. On 2 June 2007, released for the occasion from his contractual duties with Godolphin, he rode the favourite Authorized to a comfortable win for trainer Peter Chapple-Hyam. &quot;I had to pinch myself crossing the line to make sure it was real not a dream&quot;, said Dettori.

Dettori&#x27;s relationship with Godolphin was under increasing strain by 2012. In the spring of that year, Godolphin hired two younger jockeys, Mickaël Barzalona and Silvestre de Sousa, to ride alongside Dettori who found himself &quot;jocked off&quot; in big races. In October, Dettori rode Camelot for Godolphin&#x27;s rival Coolmore Stud in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe and later the same month Godolphin announced that they would not be continuing Dettori&#x27;s retainer the following year.

===Later career===
In December 2012 Dettori was given a six-month suspension after a failed a drug test in France in September. He admitted to having used cocaine, telling Clare Balding in an interview on Channel 4:&quot;Things were going bad, I was depressed and I guess a moment of weakness and I fell for it and I&#x27;ve only got myself to blame&quot;. Following his six-month ban, Dettori made his racing comeback at Epsom on 31 May 2013. A week later, he won his first race since the ban, riding Asian Trader at Sandown. That month he was signed as retained rider in Britain for Sheikh Joaan Al Thani&#x27;s Al Shaqab Racing. In 2016, Dettori rode Galileo Gold to win the 2000 Guineas for Al Shaqab Racing.

Dettori also re-established an association with trainer Gosden, notably securing victories on Golden Horn in the 2015 Derby and Enable in the 2017 Oaks and Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. In 2018 Dettori decided to end his formal association with Al Shaqab Racing in order to concentrate on riding for Gosden. He rode the Juddmonte-owned Enable to further Group 1 victories, including another win in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. Also in the colours of Juddmonte, stayer Stadivarius provided Dettori with three consecutive Ascot Gold Cup wins in 2018–2020. The trainer and jockey fell out over Dettori&#x27;s rides at 2022 Royal Ascot, in particular that on Stradivarius when he was beaten a length into third place in the Gold Cup.

On 17 December 2022 during an interview with ITV Racing, Dettori announced that he would be retiring at the end of the following season, with his final rides likely to come at the November 2023 Breeders&#x27; Cup meeting at Santa Anita Park in California. He said that, having just turned 52, he wanted to retire while he was still getting good horses to ride in the big races. By the time he announced his forthcoming retirement, he had ridden 282 Group/Grade 1 winners worldwide, including 21 British Classic winners.

Dettori started his 2023 farewell tour with a ten-week stint in the United States, based at Santa Anita Park for its winter racing. A treble on the first day of the meeting included a win in the San Antonio Stakes on 2022 Dubai World Cup winner Country Grammer, trained by Bob Baffert. On a return to Dubai in March, Country Grammer could manage only seventh place in the Dubai World Cup, but on the same evening Dettori won the Group 1 Dubai Turf on the Gosden-trained Lord North.

During the summer of 2023, Dettori added to his tally of British Group 1 and Classic races, winning the 2000 Guineas on 6 May on Chaldean for trainer Andrew Balding and then achieving a double at Epsom on 2 June with wins in the Coronation Cup on Emily Upjohn and the Oaks on Soul Sister (horse), both trained by John and Thady Gosden.

In October 2023, Dettori announced that, instead of retiring, he would be moving to California and continuing to race in the United States and on the international circuit. On what was scheduled to be his final day of racing in Britain, Dettori rode Trawlerman to victory in the Long Distance Cup before completing a double on King of Steel in the Champion Stakes at Ascot on British Champions&#x27; Day on 21 October 2023. He also watched as Queen Camilla unveiled a statue of him at the racecourse. In December 2023 he moved to California and had ridden six winners within two weeks. His first Grade 1 win of his stay in California came in March 2024, when he rode Newgate, trained by Baffert, to victory in the Santa Anita Handicap.

==TV appearances==
Dettori was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998. Between September 2002 and September 2004 he was one of the team captains on the BBC programme &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;. During his suspension from racing in 2013, Dettori became a housemate on the eleventh series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and was the fifth person to be evicted from the house. In November–December 2023, Dettori appeared on the twenty-third series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, entering as a late arrival alongside Tony Bellew. He spent 12 days in the camp before becoming the first contestant to be voted off.

==Restaurants==
In 2004 Dettori teamed up with chef Marco Pierre White to open a chain of several Italian restaurants called &quot;Frankie&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot;. He has also published a cookbook and produced a line of frozen Italian foods.

==Personal life==
Dettori married Catherine Allen on 20 July 1997 at the Catholic Church in Newmarket. The couple lived in Stetchworth near Newmarket for 17 years and have five children. In 2006, Dettori added his voice to a campaign to raise jockeys&#x27; weights, saying: &quot;I am and weigh but I have to sometimes go down to .&quot; He has also spoken about bulimia and using laxatives and diuretics to keep his weight down. Dettori was awarded an honorary MBE for services to racing in the 2001 New Year Honours (honorary as he is a foreign national). In 2011 Dettori was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science at Anglia Ruskin University.

Dettori made use of an alleged tax avoidance scheme devised by Paul Baxendale-Walker, which led to a legal dispute with HMRC. His anonymity in the case was lifted by a court order in December 2024.

<text>Shattered is a reality television programme shown on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, aired in January 2004 and presented by Dermot O&#x27;Leary.

Ten contestants were challenged with going without sleep for seven days while their actions were monitored, undergoing daily performance testing and a variety of challenges. They were competing for a potential prize fund of £100,000, with deductions made from the prize fund every time a contestant fell asleep. 

==Premise and challenges==
&quot;Shattered&quot; was filmed in a specially constructed &quot;laboratory&quot; inside an abandoned shopping centre in Wapping.&quot;&quot; The ten participants selected for the show were aged between 19 and 33, with one eliminated each night until the &quot;sleep-off&quot;. They were initially kept awake for 36 hours, with a two-hour nap permitted before the live first episode. No medicines, alcohol, drugs, electronic equipment, mobile phones or musical instruments were allowed to be used. Performance tests included physical and mental tests, including tests of memory. Contestants were put forward for an elimination challenge after showing the greatest deterioration in performance in a day.

===You Snooze You Lose===
Every day a contestant was chosen by their peers to endure an hour-long &quot;You Snooze You Lose&quot; challenge, in which the chosen contestant was tasked with remaining awake through an experience intended to encourage them to fall asleep. These challenges included cuddling teddy bears, listening to a bedtime story in an overheated room, and watching paint dry while seated in a comfortable chair. 

=== The Sleep-Off ===
On the final day the contestants were sent to bed, with the last to fall asleep winning. The show reported that Jonathan Wood and Chris Wandel fell asleep within 15 minutes while Clare Southern continued to stay awake for nearly two hours, until producers intervened. She endured 178 hours of sleep deprivation, and won £97,000 in prize money.

==Health effects==
Contestants were provided with intermittent naps, daily sessions with a psychiatrist and doctor, and a doctor on call 24 hours a day during filming, with an ethics board adivising on issues surrounding the show. However, adverse effects of the sleep deprivation were evident in some contestants. For example, Chris reported major hallucinations and believed himself to be the Prime Minister of Australia, and Lucy left the show after consulting with the show&#x27;s psychologists. None of the contestants reported significant long-term health consequences, with only weight gain and jet lag lasting a few days reported.

==Reception==
34 complaints were made to Ofcom about the effects of sleep deprivation on the contestants, as well as concern about the premise of the show. Ofcom said none of its programme guidelines were breached, and Channel 4 denied exploitation of the contestants, as well as emphasising the presence of ethics advisers and medical staff during filming.

1.8 million viewers watched both the first and second episodes of the programme.

<doc id="888831" wikidata="Q428732" url="?curid=888831" title="Phocaea">
<text>Phocaea or Phokaia (Ancient Greek: Φώκαια, &quot;Phókaia&quot;; modern-day Foça in Turkey) was an ancient Ionian Greek city on the western coast of Anatolia. Greek colonists from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (modern-day Marseille, in France) in 600 BC, Emporion (modern-day Empúries, in Catalonia, Spain) in 575 BC and Elea (modern-day Velia, in Campania, Italy) in 540 BC.

==Geography==
Phocaea was the northernmost of the Ionian cities, on the boundary with Aeolis. It was located near the mouth of the river Hermus (now Gediz), and situated on the coast of the peninsula separating the Gulf of Cyme to the north, named for the largest of the Aeolian cities, and the Gulf of Smyrna (now İzmir) to the south.

Phocaea had two natural harbours within close range of the settlement, both containing a number of small islands. Phocaea&#x27;s harbours allowed it to develop a thriving seafaring economy, and to become a great naval power, which greatly influenced its culture.

Recent archaeological surveys have shown that the city of Phocaea was large for the archaic period. Herodotus gives an idea of the size of Phocaea by describing the walls of Phocaea as having a length of several stadia.

A 4th century BC Persian tomb, known as Tas Kule (rock tower), stands () east of Phocaea along a main road. This funerary monument was carved out of solid rock with a lower high rectangular story () surmounted by a second high story (). Four steps between the two levels suggest strong Persian influence and most archaeologists believe this tomb was built for a Persian aristocrat or local leader serving the Persians. Compare the style of the tomb of Cyrus.

==History==

The ancient Greek geographer Pausanias says that Phocaea was founded by Phocians under Athenian leadership, on land given to them by the Aeolian Cymaeans, and that they were admitted into the Ionian League after accepting as kings the line of Codrus. Pottery remains indicate Aeolian presence as late as the 9th century BC, and Ionian presence as early as the end of the 9th century BC. From this an approximate date of settlement for Phocaea can be inferred.

According to Herodotus the Phocaeans were the first Greeks to make long sea-voyages, having discovered the coasts of the Adriatic, Tyrrhenia and Spain. Herodotus relates that they so impressed Arganthonios, king of Tartessus in Spain, that he invited them to settle there, and, when they declined, gave them a great sum of money to build a wall around their city.

Their sea travel was extensive. To the south they probably conducted trade with the Greek colony of Naucratis in Egypt, which was the colony of their fellow Ionian city Miletus. To the north, they probably helped settle Amisos (Samsun) on the Black Sea, and Lampsacus at the north end of the Hellespont (now the Dardanelles). However Phocaea&#x27;s major colonies were to the west. These included Alalia in Corsica, Emporiae and Rhoda in Spain, and especially Massalia (Marseille) in France.

Phocaea remained independent until the reign of the Lydian king Croesus (circa 560–545 BC), when they, along with the rest of mainland Ionia, first, fell under Lydian control and then, along with Lydia (who had allied itself with Sparta) were conquered by Cyrus the Great of Persia in 546 BC, in one of the opening skirmishes of the great Greco-Persian conflict.

Rather than submit to Persian rule, the Phocaeans abandoned their city. Some may have fled to Chios, others to their colonies on Corsica and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, with some eventually returning to Phocaea. Many however became the founders of Elea, around 540 BC.

In 500 BC, Phocaea joined the Ionian Revolt against Persia. Indicative of its naval prowess, Dionysius, a Phocaean was chosen to command the Ionian fleet at the decisive Battle of Lade, in 494 BC. However, indicative of its declining fortunes, Phocaea was only able to contribute three ships, out of a total of &quot;three hundred and fifty three&quot;. The Ionian fleet was defeated and the revolt ended shortly thereafter.
After the defeat of Xerxes I by the Greeks in 480 BC and the subsequent rise of Athenian power, Phocaea joined the Delian League, paying tribute to Athens of two talents. In 412 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, with the help of Sparta, Phocaea rebelled along with the rest of Ionia. The Peace of Antalcidas, which ended the Corinthian War, returned nominal control to Persia in 387 BC.

In 343 BC, the Phocaeans unsuccessfully laid siege to Kydonia on the island of Crete.

During the Hellenistic period it fell under Seleucid, then Attalid rule. In the Roman period, the town was a manufacturing center for ceramic vessels, including the late Roman Phocaean red slip.

It was later under the control of Benedetto Zaccaria, the Genoese ambassador to Byzantium, who received the town as a hereditary lordship; Zaccaria and his descendants amassed a considerable fortune from his properties there, especially the rich alum mines. It remained a Genoese colony until it was taken by the Turks in 1455. It is a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1914, Phocaea was the location of a massacre against ethnic Greek civilians by Turkish irregular bands.

==Coinage==

Probably following the Lydians, the Phocaeans were among the earliest in the world to make and use coins as money. Its earliest coins were made of electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold. The British Museum has a Phocaean coin containing the image of a seal dating from 600 to 550 BC.

<text>Louis Carl Dobbs (September 24, 1945 – July 18, 2024) was an American conservative political commentator, author, and television host who presented &quot;Moneyline&quot; (later &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;) from 1980 to 2009 and 2011 to 2021. From 2021 until his death, he hosted &quot;The Great America Show&quot; on iHeartRadio and loudobbs.com.

Dobbs started working with CNN at its inception in 1980, serving as a reporter and network vice president. On the air, he served as host and managing editor of the network&#x27;s business program, &quot;Moneyline&quot;, which premiered in 1980. The show was renamed &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; in 2003. Dobbs resigned from CNN in 1999 but rejoined the network in 2001. He resigned once again in November 2009. He was the former talk radio host of &quot;Lou Dobbs Radio&quot;. From 2011, he hosted &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; on the Fox Business Network until the network cancelled it in February 2021.

Dobbs was an early promoter of birtherism, the unfounded accusation that former U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural-born U.S. citizen. He was known for anti-illegal immigration views, as well as for opposition to NAFTA and other trade deals. A staunch supporter of Donald Trump, he infused his show with pro-Trump coverage. He was one of three Fox Corporation program hosts named in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit by Smartmatic relating to conspiracy theories used in attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. Dobbs was among the hosts named in the &quot;Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network&quot; defamation lawsuit for broadcasting false statements about the plaintiff company&#x27;s voting machines that Fox News settled for $787.5 million and required Fox News to acknowledge that the broadcast statements were false.

==Early life and education==
Louis Carl Dobbs was born September 24, 1945, in Childress, Texas. He was the son of Frank Dobbs, a co-owner of a propane business, and Lydia Mae (née Hensley), a bookkeeper. When Dobbs was twelve, his father&#x27;s propane business failed and the family moved to Rupert, Idaho. Although accepted at the University of Idaho and Idaho State University, he was persuaded by the staff at Minico High School to apply to Harvard University, where he was accepted and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.

==Career==
After college, Dobbs worked for federal anti-poverty programs in Boston and Washington, D.C., then returned to Idaho. He briefly attended the University of Idaho College of Law in Moscow, and then worked as a cash-management specialist for Union Bank of California in Los Angeles. He married his high school sweetheart in 1967, and in 1970 their first son was born. Dobbs moved to Yuma, Arizona, and got a job as a police and fire reporter for KBLU. By the mid-1970s, he was a television anchor and reporter in Phoenix, and he later joined Seattle&#x27;s KING-TV. In 1979, he was contacted by a recruiter for Ted Turner, who was in the process of forming CNN.

===CNN===
Dobbs joined CNN when it launched in 1980, serving as its chief economics correspondent and as host of the business news program &quot;Moneyline&quot; on CNN. Dobbs also served as a corporate executive for CNN, as its executive vice president and as a member of CNN&#x27;s executive committee. 

Dobbs was president of CNNfn (CNN financial news) and anchored the program &quot;Business Unusual&quot;. His ratings were typically triple that of his former protégé, Maria Bartiromo. Howard Kurtz, in his book on business journalism of the era, wrote that Dobbs &quot;could be arrogant and abrasive&quot; and was controversial within CNN. In 1992, Dobbs admitted to receiving more than $15,000 to act as a spokesman from Shearson Lehman Brothers, PaineWebber, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, making promotional videos; he was reprimanded by the network for the conflict of interest and expressed regret in a memo to staff. 

Dobbs nearly left the network in 1997 over a clash on CNNfn&#x27;s direction; he ultimately convincted Turner to expand CNNfn from 14 hours per day to 18 hours per day, with a committment to further increase it to 24 hours per day.

===Departure and founding of Space.com===
Dobbs repeatedly clashed with Rick Kaplan, who became president of CNN in 1997. Dobbs said Kaplan, a friend of then president Bill Clinton, was &quot;clearly partisan&quot; and &quot;was pushing Clinton stories&quot;, while Kaplan said Dobbs was &quot;a very difficult person to work with.&quot;

On April 20, 1999, CNN was covering Clinton&#x27;s speech in Littleton, Colorado, following the Columbine High School massacre. Dobbs ordered the producer to cut away from the speech and return to broadcast &quot;Moneyline.&quot; Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN to return to the speech. Kaplan later said, &quot;Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it&quot;. Dobbs announced on the air that &quot;CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton.&quot; A few days later, Dobbs announced that he was leaving the network to start Space.com, a website devoted to astronautical news. Dobbs was subsequently replaced as host of &quot;Moneyline&quot; by Willow Bay and Stuart Varney.

===Space.com===
Dobbs announced that he was leaving CNN to start up the site Space.com in July 1999. Dobbs was one of the primary shareholders in that company and later that year became Space.com&#x27;s chief executive officer. Dobbs returned to CNN in 2001.

===Return to CNN===
Kaplan left CNN in August 2000, and Dobbs returned the following year, at the behest of his friend and CNN founder Ted Turner, becoming host and managing editor of the new and initially more general news program &quot;Lou Dobbs Reporting&quot;, which later became &quot;CNN News Sunday Morning&quot;. He also regained the helm of the newly renamed &quot;Lou Dobbs Moneyline&quot; (which became &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; in June 2003).

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Dobbs started to increasingly focus on the alleged dangers of illegal immigration after returning to CNN. Dobbs became a self-described populist after his return to CNN, and criticized the &quot;greed&quot; of big corporations and their opposition to raising the minimum wage.
===Exit from CNN===
In July 2009, controversy around Dobbs began when he was the only mainstream news anchor to give airtime to the birther theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Several media watch groups, including Media Matters and the Southern Poverty Law Center, criticized Dobbs for his reporting. The controversy eventually caused CNN President Jon Klein to rein Dobbs in via an internal memorandum. In September, advocates challenged Dobbs for appearing at a conference organized by the pro-border security group Federation for American Immigration Reform. Multiple campaigns were launched, including &quot;Drop Dobbs&quot; (NDN, Media Matters). The campaigns also attacked CNN for alleged hypocrisy towards Latinos, citing CNN&#x27;s &quot;Latino in America&quot; special as incompatible with their continued support of Dobbs. The campaigns generated considerable anti-Dobbs press.

On the November 11, 2009, edition of his nightly broadcast &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;, Dobbs announced his immediate departure from CNN, ending a nearly thirty-year career at the network, citing plans to &quot;pursue new opportunities.&quot; CNN President Jon Klein said that Dobbs&#x27;s departure was not a result of organized opposition to Dobbs&#x27;s viewpoints.

Dobbs was reportedly paid $8 million in severance pay when he left CNN.

After Dobbs left CNN in 2009, he did not rule out the possibility of running for President of the United States in 2012, saying the final decision would rest with his wife. Former Senator Dean Barkley promoted Dobbs as a potential presidential candidate with the Independence Party (formerly called the Reform Party).

===Radio===

From 2008 to 2012, Dobbs hosted &quot;Lou Dobbs Radio&quot; on United Stations Radio Networks. The three-hour daily show had affiliates in several major markets, including its flagship station (WOR) in New York City. The show was guest-centered and featured political discussion and listener calls.

Dobbs was among the hosts who tried out for the position vacated by the cancellation of &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; on WFAN, a position that was eventually filled by &quot;Boomer and Carton in the Morning&quot;.

Dobbs was also a regular columnist in &quot;Money&quot; magazine, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

===Fox Business Network===
On November 10, 2010, Fox Business Network announced that Dobbs would host a show on the channel. The network announced on March 3, 2011, the start date, show title, and time slot of Dobbs&#x27;s new show. Entitled &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;, the program debuted on March 14, 2011.

On February 4, 2021, voting machine company Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion defamation suit against multiple parties, including Dobbs and two other Fox Corporation program hosts, asserting they had promoted conspiracy theories alleging the company and its competitor Dominion Voting Systems had participated in an international conspiracy to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. The three programs had each run a video retraction weeks earlier, after receiving a demand letter from Smartmatic, though neither Dobbs nor the other hosts personally issued retractions.

Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil sued Dobbs, Fox News and Sidney Powell for $250 million in December 2021, alleging they had falsely implicated him in rigging Dominion and Smartmatic machines.Dobbs and Fox News reached a confidential settlement with Khalil in April 2023.

Fox News canceled Dobbs&#x27; show on February 5, 2021. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the decision had been under consideration before the Smartmatic legal issues arose. Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy of CNN Business claimed that, despite being the highest-rated Fox Business Network program, it was a loss leader because many advertisers did not want to be associated with the content.

Since 2009, Dobbs had made regular appearances to discuss issues on other news network programs including CNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Kudlow Report&quot; and Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. On October 5, 2010, Dobbs made a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, entitled &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot;, in which he plays a client in search of a new law firm to represent his legal interests.

==Political views==
Dobbs was known for his anti-immigration views, warnings about Islamist terrorism, and his opposition to outsourcing. He was also known for his pro-Trump coverage.

===China===
In December 2018, Dobbs suggested that the United States should start a war with China because of hacking by Chinese state actors. He compared hacking by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China to the attack by the Japanese military on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

===Birtherism===
In 2009, Dobbs promoted the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. His repeated promotion of discredited &quot;birther&quot; conspiracies even though CNN itself considered it a &quot;discredited rumor&quot;, revived a topic that had largely disappeared from the media spotlight after the 2008 presidential campaign. The Southern Poverty Law Center denounced Dobbs&#x27; on-air statements as &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;defamatory&quot; and Media Matters ran ads critical of Dobbs and of CNN/ Jon Stewart mocked Dobbs on the satirical Comedy Central television series &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. The Associated Press said that Dobbs had &quot;become a publicity nightmare for CNN, embarrassed his boss and hosted a show that seemed to contradict the network&#x27;s &#x27;no bias&#x27; brand&quot;.

===Environment===
Dobbs claimed that the scientific consensus on climate change was a hoax. Dobbs had asserted that scientists warned of global cooling in the 1970s, though that was a distinctly minority view. He likened Obama administration&#x27;s EPA to the Soviet bureacracy.

===Immigration===
Dobbs held anti-immigration views. Dobbs was strongly opposed to both illegal immigration and foreign worker programs as the H-1B visa program and guest-worker programs. In a 2006 article, Dobbs expressed frustration at failed legislation to build a southern &quot;border fence to stop the flow of illegal aliens and drugs across our borders.&quot; He argued that the &quot;true victims of corporate America&#x27;s lust for cheap labor&quot; were &quot;American working men and women, taxpayers all.&quot; During efforts to implement comprehensive immigration reform during the Bush administration in 2007, Dobbs devoted more than a quarter of all of his airtime during a three-month period to the subject of immigration, and covered it negatively.

Dobbs&#x27;s show made factually incorrect claims, such as the one that illegal immigrants were responsible for bringing 7,000 new cases of leprosy to the United States in a three-year period, where the actual timeframe was over the last thirty years. In addressing the leprosy issue, Dobbs in May 2007 compared his critics on the left and right to &quot;commies&quot; and &quot;fascists, respectively.&quot; Dobbs also falsely claimed that &quot;illegal aliens&quot; were a third of the federal prison population in the United States.

Dobbs criticized local officials for their approach to border security. In October 2007 he labeled then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer an &quot;idiot&quot; for advocating the issuance of driver&#x27;s licenses to illegal immigrants. Hillary Clinton labeled Dobbs&#x27;s illegal immigration segments as having &quot;all that hot air.&quot;

In a November 2009 interview with Telemundo, Dobbs said that the U.S. needed a &quot;rational, effective humane policy&quot; for immigration that included enhanced border security and also &quot;the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions.&quot;

In October 2010, &quot;The Nation&quot; published the results of a yearlong investigation detailing undocumented workers who had worked on Dobbs&#x27;s personal properties. The labor involved upkeep of Dobbs&#x27;s multimillion-dollar estates in New Jersey and Florida, including the horses belonging to his daughter, Hillary, a champion show jumper. The article featured interviews with five immigrants who had worked without papers on Dobbs&#x27;s properties. Dobbs denied aever employing illegal labor and called the allegations a &quot;a political assault.&quot;

In November 2018, Dobbs falsely claimed that &quot;many&quot; undocumented immigrants voted in the 2018 mid-term elections and that they had an &quot;immense impact.&quot;

Dobbs&#x27;s critics, including columnist James K. Glassman, author of &quot;Dow 36,000&quot; and member of the American Enterprise Institute think tank, accused him of inciting xenophobia. Others accused him of Hispanophobia, a charge he denied and one which he said offends him deeply, as his wife Debi Segura is a Mexican American.

After President Donald Trump stated in March 2019 that he supported legal immigration &quot;in the largest numbers ever,&quot; Dobbs lamented that Trump was advancing &quot;the interests of the global elite ahead of our citizens,&quot; adding, &quot;the White House has simply lost its way.&quot;

===Support for Trump===
Dobbs&#x27;s fawning coverage of the Trump presidency was described as sycophantic. Fox News president Jay Wallace said in a September 2020 private message to a colleague that &quot;the North Koreans do a more nuanced show&quot; than Dobbs. Dobbs opened a November 2017 interview with Trump with &quot;You have accomplished so much&quot;, and later said to Trump that he was &quot;one of the most loved and respected&quot; presidents &quot;in history&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the interview as a love-fest and &quot;courtier-like session&quot;, as Dobbs &quot;didn&#x27;t so much ask questions as open his mouth and let rose petals fall out&quot;. During Trump&#x27;s presidency, Dobbs was described as a &quot;close informal adviser to President Donald Trump&quot;. Trump repeatedly called Dobbs to get his views on various policy issues.

Dobbs promoted &quot;Deep State&quot; conspiracy theories. In January 2018, he called for a &quot;war&quot; on what he called the &quot;deep state&quot; of FBI and the Department of Justice, whom he claimed were clandestinely working to bring down the Trump presidency. In June 2018, Dobbs promoted a conspiracy which originated on Reddit and the far-right conspiracy website Gateway Pundit that &quot;the FBI may have initiated a number of spies&quot; into Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign. Trump retweeted Dobbs&#x27;s assertion and praised Dobbs for a &quot;great interview&quot;. In July 2018, Dobbs said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was on a &quot;jihad&quot; against Trump, and accused him of seeking to &quot;subvert&quot; and &quot;overthrow&quot; Trump&#x27;s presidency. In December 2018, Dobbs called the FBI &quot;a legion of evildoers&quot; and &quot;politically corrupt.&quot; That same month, he said that the judge overseeing Michael Flynn&#x27;s sentencing sounded as if he was part of Mueller&#x27;s &quot;witch hunt&quot;.

In July 2018, Dobbs defended the Trump administration&#x27;s decision to ban a CNN reporter from a press event. Multiple Fox colleagues, including Fox News President Jay Wallace, had shown solidarity with CNN and called on the White House to rescind the ban. His defense led to charges of hypocrisy: in 2012, when a &quot;Daily Caller&quot; reporter was criticized by the White House for shouting out a question during an address by Obama, Dobbs defended the reporter, saying &quot;What is rude is a president not speaking to the American people and taking the questions of the White House press&quot;. CNN&#x27;s Jake Tapper suggested that Dobbs was hypocritical.

In August 2018, Dobbs ran a segment pushing unsubstantiated claims that Google was biased against Trump and that Google was promoting anti-Trump stories. Following Dobbs&#x27;s segment, Trump tweeted that Google was suppressing conservatives and tasked economic adviser Larry Kudlow to look into regulating Google.

In September 2018, after Trump inaccurately claimed that the official death count from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico was fabricated by Democrats, Dobbs defended Trump&#x27;s assertion. Dobbs claimed that &quot;the numbers were inflated&quot; and that the organizations behind the numbers &quot;threw out science, statistics, and evidence to discredit the Trump administration&quot;.

In October 2018, when CNN and prominent Democrats were targeted with mail bomb, Dobbs described the bomb attempts as &quot;fake news&quot; and baselessly claimed that the mail bombs were sent by Democrats who sought to increase their support in the upcoming mid-term elections. The pipe bombs were in fact mailed by a fanatical rump supporter. Several Fox News employees expressed dismay over Dobbs&#x27;s rhetoric, with one employee telling CNN, &quot;It&#x27;s people like Dobbs who really ruin it for all the hard working journalists at Fox&quot;.

When the Trump administration rescinded CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta&#x27;s press pass, Dobbs supported the administration. At the same time, numerous media organizations, including Fox News, spoke out against the Trump administration&#x27;s decision. When U.S. District Court Judge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee, temporarily restored Acosta&#x27;s press pass, Dobbs described the ruling as &quot;absurd&quot;. When the Trump administration complied with the ruling, Dobbs called on the administration to ignore the ruling and tell the &quot;district court judge to go to hell&quot;.

In January 2019, Dobbs described Mitt Romney as a &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;treasonous&quot; after he wrote an op-ed published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticizing Trump&#x27;s character. In July 2019, Dobbs referred to U.S. military generals who raised concerns about Trump&#x27;s decision to put on a July 4 military show in Washington D.C. as &quot;snowflake generals&quot;.

During the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that former Trump national security advisor and 11-year paid contributor to Fox News John Bolton had written in his forthcoming book that Trump had told him that he wanted to continue withholding aid to Ukraine until the country investigated Democrats and the Bidens. On his show the following day, Dobbs asserted that Bolton had been &quot;reduced to a tool for the radical Dems and the deep state with his allegation&quot;.

The day senior Justice Department officials intervened in the case of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone with a recommendation of a lighter sentence than had been recommended by DOJ prosecutors the prior day, Dobbs stated on his program that attorney general Bill Barr was &quot;doing the Lord&#x27;s work&quot; by intervening. The intervention raised questions about the political neutrality of the DOJ. The next day, Barr stated in a televised interview that Trump&#x27;s comments about ongoing DOJ investigations &quot;make it impossible to do my job&quot;, causing Dobbs to state on his program, &quot;I guess I am so disappointed in Bill Barr, I have to say this – it&#x27;s a damn shame when he doesn&#x27;t get what this president has gone through, and what the American people have gone through, and what his charge is as attorney general.&quot; The following day, after the Justice Department stated it would not prosecute former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, a frequent target of Trump&#x27;s ire, Dobbs stated on his program, &quot;I have serious, serious questions tonight about the integrity of the Justice Department under Attorney General Barr.&quot;

As Trump, his surrogates and supporters made baseless claims of voting fraud in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, Dobbs chastised Republicans for not helping the president to claim &quot;what is rightfully his&quot;. He said that Republicans who voted to certify Joe Biden&#x27;s Electoral College win were &quot;criminal&quot;. After Attorney General Bill Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the election, Dobbs said that Barr was &quot;compromised&quot; and had become part of the &quot;deep state&quot;. 

In December 2020, Dobbs aired a segment on his show debunking the very same conspiracy theories that had been amplified on his show; this was in response to a legal threat by the voting technology company Smartmatic which had been the subject of some of the conspiracy theorizing. Speaking to Republican consultant Ed Rollins during his January 4, 2021, broadcast, Dobbs said:

We&#x27;re eight weeks from the election, and we still don&#x27;t have verifiable, tangible support for the crimes that everyone knows were committed—that is, defrauding other citizens who voted with fraudulent votes. We know that&#x27;s the case in Nevada, we know it&#x27;s the case in Pennsylvania and a number of other states, but we have had a devil of a time finding actual proof. Why?

Following the storming of the United States Capitol by Trump supporters in January 2021, Dobbs was among those who advanced the conspiracy theory that people associated with antifa were responsible for the attack.

===George Soros conspiracy theories===
Dobbs was a proponent of numerous conspiracy theories about the Jewish-American philanthropist and businessman George Soros. Dobbs referred to him as an &quot;evil SOB&quot; and insidious.

Dobbs&#x27;s Fox Business Channel shows stirred controversy in October 2018 when a guest on Dobbs&#x27;s show used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was &quot;Soros-occupied&quot; territory echoing the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory of a &quot;Zionist-occupied government&quot;. The remarks came days after bombing attempts on Soros and leading Democrats, and the remarks were replayed on Fox Business hours after an anti-Semitic gunman at a Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 people.

After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that the guest, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch, would no longer be booked and that the program episode would be withdrawn from the Fox News archives. In the midst of the Trump-Ukraine scandal in November 2019, attorney Joseph diGenova made similar comments on Dobbs&#x27;s program, falsely claiming that &quot;George Soros controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department. He also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NGOs – work with NGOs. That was very evident in Ukraine.&quot; Dobbs did not dispute diGenova&#x27;s claim.

===Other views===
Dobbs opposed gun control and, though he was a fiscal conservative, supported some government regulations, as revealed in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview. He was critical of trade policies that he said encourage &quot;sending jobs overseas&quot;.

Dobbs&#x27;s stance on trade earned plaudits from some trade union activists on the traditional political left, while his stance on immigration tended to appeal to the right.

Dobbs was the author of &quot;War on the Middle Class&quot;, in which he claimed both Democrats and Republicans are harming the middle class. In it, he came out strongly against the Bush tax cuts, which he argued favor the wealthy, and argued for raising the U.S. minimum wage from what was then $5.15 an hour.

In March 2009, Dobbs said he thought there should not be a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

==Reception==
Journalist Amy Goodman criticized Dobbs&#x27;s journalistic ethics, accusing him of making flagrant errors in his reporting and assailing his staff&#x27;s association with what she describes as disreputable sources.

==Awards==
Dobbs won numerous major awards for his television journalism, including a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award and a Cable Ace Award. He received the George Foster Peabody Award for his coverage of the 1987 stock market crash. He also has received the Luminary Award of the Business Journalism Review in 1990, the Horatio Alger Association Award for Distinguished Americans in 1999 and the National Space Club Media Award in 2000. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; has named Dobbs &quot;TV&#x27;s Premier Business News Anchorman&quot;. In 2004, Dobbs was awarded the Eugene Katz Award For Excellence in the Coverage of Immigration by the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigrant think tank founded by white supremacist John Tanton, and in 2005 he received the now-defunct Alexis de Tocqueville Institution&#x27;s Statesmanship Award. In 2008 Dobbs received the American Legion Public Relations Award from the National Commander of The American Legion.

==Personal life and death==
Dobbs divorced his first wife in 1981 and later married Debi Lee Segura, a former CNN sports anchor. The couple raised four children together.

Dobbs died on July 18, 2024, at the age of 78.

<text>U.S. Route 42 (US 42) is an east–west United States highway that runs southwest–northeast for from Louisville, Kentucky to Cleveland, Ohio. The route has several names including Pearl Road from Cleveland to Medina in Northeast Ohio, Reading Road in Cincinnati, Cincinnati and Lebanon Pike in southwestern Ohio and Brownsboro Road in Louisville. Traveling northeast, the highway ends in downtown Cleveland and traveling southwest ends in Louisville.

Interstate 71 (I-71) fully supplanted US 42 as an interurban highway in the early 1960s, relegating US 42 to its current role as an ordinary town-to-town surface road. Additionally, I-71 passes through Columbus, whereas US 42 bypasses Columbus. It remains intact as a route; no part of it has ever been diverted to any Interstate highway. It is not the &quot;parent&quot; of any US route with a related number.

In spite of its even number, US 42 is posted north–south in Ohio.

==Route description==

===Kentucky===

U.S. Route 42 starts in Louisville, Kentucky, heading northeast through Prospect on the Oldham County and Jefferson County line. From here US 42 is a two lane road passing through the northern Kentucky hills paralleling between Interstate 71 and the Ohio River. Next, it passes through Goshen near North Oldham High School, situated on the north side. US 42 continues through Oldham County into Trimble County. In Bedford US 42 intersects with US 421 and is concurrent through downtown. The route still heading northeast crosses into Carroll County prior to crossing the Kentucky River and entering Carrollton. US 42 follows northeast along the south bank of the Ohio River passing Markland Lock and Dam and KY 1039 Markland Dam Bridge which connects between Kentucky Speedway and Indiana. Heading east US 42 parallels the Ohio River passing through Warsaw, Gallatin County about prior to intersecting with US 127 starting an extended concurrency. US 127 heads south toward Glencoe, Owenton, and eventually Frankfort.

From the intersection with US 127, US 42 turns away from the Ohio River bank. US 42 enters Boone County about prior to intersecting with the western terminus of Kentucky Route 14 (KY 14). Continuing north US 42-127 in about intersects Beaver Road KY 338 creating a wrong-way concurrency between US 127 and KY 338: when going north, drivers are traveling east on US 42, north on US 127, and south on Kentucky 338. This continues for less than a mile until it intersects with Richwood Pike where KY 338 splits off continuing south.

Continuing north for several miles the US 42-127 intersects with KY 536 (Mount Zion Road). Prior to KY 536 Ryle High School sits on the road&#x27;s west side. Just south of Ryle, US 42 turns from a two-lane country road to a five-lane road. US 42 passes through Union prior to continuing to the northeast with US 127. After a couple of miles, it crosses Interstate 71/Interstate 75. Entering Florence US 42 intersects with KY 842 and KY 237. Within Florence US 25 Dixie Highway joins in a concurrency with US 42-127 which takes on the name Dixie Highway. After crossing briefly into Elsmere, the route enters Erlanger. US 42 becomes almost entirely a commercial road for the duration of its length in Erlanger. Prior to leaving Erlanger, US 42 becomes narrower and more congested after it crosses KY 236.

US 42 is primarily a commercial road prior to crossing under I-275 and proceeds to turn back into an almost purely residential road with a few exceptions while going north. The route intersects with KY 1303 (Turkeyfoot Road) northern terminus. The Crestview Hills town center lies just south of I-275 on the east side of the road, between Dixie Highway and Turkeyfoot Road. Dixie Heights High School is less than a mile down the road on the western side. Two intersections later US 42 is joined with KY 371 for about . After crossing I-71/I-75 again the road heads in a northeast direction closely parallel to I-71/I-75. As it heads north US 42 starts off mostly as a residential road, turning more and more into a commercial road.

As it winds down from the suburbs into Covington the highway&#x27;s name changes from Dixie Highway to Pike Street prior to crossing I-71/I-75 again. US 25-42-127 turns left on Main St heading north and crossing KY 8. US 42 crosses into Ohio from Covington on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge, together with US 25 and US 127.

===Ohio===

US 42 stretches across Ohio. It is classified as 59.3% rural and 40.7% urban, with only coded as freeway (while running concurrently with US 23 in Delaware). The route begins in Cincinnati, then passes through Hamilton, Butler, Warren, Greene, Clark, Madison, Union, Delaware, Morrow, Richland, Ashland, Wayne and Medina, Cuyahoga counties prior to reaching its terminus in Cleveland. The route barely enters Butler and Wayne counties with about in each.

US 42 crosses into Cincinnati from Covington, Kentucky, on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge, concurrent with US 127. US 42 heads northeast out of Cincinnati on Reading Road, which runs between I-71 and I-75. In 2020, the Cincinnati City Council approved a project to rename Reading Road to President Barack Obama Avenue from Downtown Cincinnati to Reading, pending private donations; all 30,000 signs are expected to be installed by September 2021. Reading Road intersects with I-275, then briefly enters Butler County. The Ohio Department of Transportation has given this portion of US 42 the name Columbus–Cincinnati Road, but it is locally known as Cincinnati–Columbus Road, a name that also appears on West Chester Township signs along the road.

The portion of US 42 in Warren County between Lebanon and Waynesville is designated &quot;Sergeant Brian Dulle Memorial Highway&quot;, in honor of a Warren County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy who was struck and killed along US 42 on May 10, 2011, by a stolen car, while he was laying out stop sticks to catch the driver.

The intersection with Spring Valley–Paintersville Road in Spring Valley Township, Greene County near the village of Spring Valley has been the site of numerous fail-to-yield accidents, including a double fatality in 2017. In October 2018, the Ohio Department of Transportation announced that it would convert the intersection into a &quot;basic RCUT&quot;, which would add a median and replace all left turns with right-in/right-out turns and median U-turns. The project is expected to cost around $1.2 million and begin in late 2020.

In Xenia, the designation &quot;Brigadier General Charles Young Memorial Historical Corridor&quot; leaves US 68 and joins US 42 at the routes&#x27; junction, in honor of Young, a pioneering figure in US history, and at his death, the highest-ranking Black officer in the Regular Army.

Still in Xenia, the intersection of US 42 (North Columbus Street) and East Church Street, where US 42 formerly continued at an awkward angle, was converted to a roundabout on June 12, 2020, at a cost of approximately $1.1 million.

After leaving Xenia, the route and the memorial historical corridor cross into Wilberforce. There they pass the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument, located at Young&#x27;s former house. The memorial historical corridor ends at Campus Drive, on the campus of Wilberforce University, where Young had been a professor.

After Wilberforce, major cities along the route are London, Delaware, Mansfield, Ashland and Medina prior to reaching the Cleveland metropolitan area. In London US 42 intersects with I-70. Other than a short concurrency at each end, in Delaware are the only other two concurrencies with US routes. Entering Delaware from the south US 42 runs concurrent with US 23 in Delaware until the junction with US 36 which it follows east for about before turning back to the north. The concurrence with US 23 is the only stretch of US 42 that is categorized as a freeway in Ohio.

Heading into Cuyahoga County at Strongsville, US 42 intersects I-80, the Ohio Turnpike, and continues through Middleburg Heights, Parma Heights, and Parma heading into Cleveland and is known locally as Pearl Road. US 42 continues north intersecting with I-71 and nearby exits to I-90. The route is part of the Ohio &amp; Erie Canalway Scenic Byway while continuing north on West 25th. At this point on the route the road is a business district surrounded by varying business and residents of the Ohio City neighborhood. Along this stretch of the route, can be found many historic buildings, including the West Side Market. The last stretch of US 42 is a concurrency with US 6.

The eastern/northern end of US 42 finds its terminus at the intersection of Superior Avenue and Ontario Street in the middle of Public Square in downtown Cleveland. This intersection also serves as the western terminus of US 322 coming from the east on Superior as well as the western termini of US 422, Ohio State Route 14 (SR 14), and SR 87 and the northern terminus of SR 8 coming from the south on Ontario.

<text>Pamela Wallin Live is a Canadian interview series which aired on CBC Newsworld from 1995 to 1999. It was hosted by Pamela Wallin.

Following her highly publicized firing from the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Prime Time News&quot; in 1995, Wallin formed her own production company and launched the series. Instead of reporting or anchoring the news, &quot;Pamela Wallin Live&quot; featured Wallin interviewing newsmakers, celebrities and other figures in a format similar to CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;.

The show quickly proved to be one of Newsworld&#x27;s most popular offerings, and in some seasons was repeated the following afternoon on the CBC&#x27;s main network as well.

In 1998, Newsworld moved the series to a different time slot, and the show no longer aired live. Its title was changed at that time to simply Pamela Wallin.

In 1999, Wallin moved the series to CTV&#x27;s new specialty channel TalkTV, where it became Pamela Wallin&#x27;s TalkTV. It aired there until 2002, when Wallin accepted a diplomatic posting as Canada&#x27;s Consul General in New York City.

<text>Terrence William Deacon (born 1950) is an American neuroanthropologist (Ph.D. in Biological Anthropology, Harvard University 1984). He taught at Harvard for eight years, relocated to Boston University in 1992, and is currently Professor of Anthropology and member of the Cognitive Science Faculty at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Theoretical interests==
Deacon&#x27;s theoretical interests include the study of evolution-like processes at multiple levels, including their role in embryonic development, neural signal processing, language change, social processes, and focusing especially on how these different processes interact and depend on each other. He has long stated an interest in developing a scientific semiotics (particularly biosemiotics) that would contribute to both linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience.

==Fields of research==
Deacon&#x27;s research combines human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human cognition. His work extends from laboratory-based cellular-molecular neurobiology to the study of semiotic processes underlying animal and human communication, especially language and language origins. His neurobiological research is focused on determining the nature of the human divergence from typical primate brain anatomy, the cellular-molecular mechanisms producing this difference, and the correlations between these anatomical differences and special human cognitive abilities, again, particularly language.

==Work==
His 1997 book, &quot;The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain&quot; is widely considered a seminal work in the subject of evolutionary cognition. His approach to semiotics, thoroughly described in the book, is fueled by a career-long interest in the ideas of the late 19th-century American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce. In it, he uses the metaphors of &quot;parasite&quot; and &quot;host&quot; to describe language and the brain, respectively, arguing that the structures of language have co-evolved to adapt to their brain hosts.

His 2011 book, &quot;Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter&quot;, explores the properties of life, the emergence of consciousness, and the relationship between evolutionary and semiotic processes. The book speculates on how properties such as information, value, purpose, meaning, and end-directed behavior emerged from physics and chemistry. Critics of the book argue that Deacon has drawn heavily from the works of Alicia Juarrero and Evan Thompson without providing full citations or references, but a UC Berkeley investigation exonerated Deacon.

In contrast to the arguments presented by Juarrero in &quot;Dynamics in Action&quot; (1999, MIT Press) and by Thompson in &quot;Mind in Life&quot; (2007, Belknap Press and Harvard University Press), Deacon explicitly rejects claims that living or mental phenomena can be explained by dynamical systems approaches. Instead, Deacon argues that life- or mind-like properties only emerge from a higher-order reciprocal relationship between self-organizing processes.

<text>Paulo de Sacadura Cabral Portas (born 12 September 1962, ) is a Portuguese media and political figure, who has, since the 1990s, been one of Portugal&#x27;s leading conservative politicians. He was the leader of one of Portugal&#x27;s right-wing parties, the CDS – People&#x27;s Party (CDS-PP) from 1998 to 2005 and 2007–2016, on whose lists he was elected to the Portuguese Parliament in every legislative election between 1995 and 2015. He was Deputy Prime Minister of Portugal from 2013 to 2015, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs from 2011 to 2013, and Minister of Defence from 2002 to 2005, all three times in coalitions of the PSD and his CDS-PP. Portas withdrew from politics in 2016.

==Early life==
Paulo Portas was born in Lisbon and grew up in Vila Viçosa. His father, Nuno Portas, was an influential post-modernist architect, who professed progressive Roman Catholic views. His mother, Helena Sacadura Cabral (niece of aviation pioneer Artur Sacadura Cabral) is an economist, journalist and author, who held more conservative views that appear to have passed on to Paulo Portas, who stayed living with her after his parents separated. In contrast, his older brother Miguel Portas stayed with their father and became a communist and later a leftist. Their half-sister is Catarina Portas, a well-known Portuguese journalist, businesswoman and media personality.

Following the 1974 Carnation revolution in Portugal, Paulo Portas was briefly sent to school in France but returned in 1975 to study at Lisbon&#x27;s top private high school (&quot;Colégio S. João de Brito&quot;). In 1984 he got a law degree from the Portuguese Catholic University, where he met Manuel Monteiro who, 10 years later, would serve as Portas&#x27;s stepping stone into the CDS-PP and national politics. He is said to be a Church-going Catholic.

==Press career==
At age 12 in junior high school, Paulo Portas is said to have launched a school newspaper called &quot;Laughs and Smiles&quot; (&quot;Risos e Sorrisos&quot;); it is not known how long it lasted. In his mid-teens (1974–75) he began contributing to the official newspaper of the youth wing of the PSD (which at the time was called &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot;, &#x27;PPD&#x27;). The paper was called &quot;On Behalf of Socialism&quot; (&quot;Pelo Socialismo&quot;) and Portas became its chief editor. As a teen he also began working on the conservative daily &quot;A Tarde&quot; and weekly &quot;O Tempo&quot; newspapers and soon his eloquent anti-leftist views earned him guest opinion columns in the few conservative newspapers of post-revolution Lisbon. He first became nationally known at 15 years of age when he wrote a letter-to-the-editor of the daily evening newspaper &quot;Jornal Novo&quot; that prominently published it under the heading &quot;Three Betrayals&quot; (&quot;Três Traições&quot;) directly accusing then president Ramalho Eanes, prime minister Mário Soares and foreign minister Diogo Freitas do Amaral of &quot;selling out&quot; Portugal&#x27;s African colonies in 1974–75. The article earned him a libel lawsuit from President Eanes and valuable public exposure to get his own weekly opinion column in &quot;O Tempo&quot; and, some years later, in the new weekly &quot;Semanário&quot;.
In 1987, he co-founded, with Miguel Esteves Cardoso, the weekly newspaper &quot;O Independente&quot;, which started publication in May 1988 and became known for its innovative editorial concepts as well as for denouncing political scandals, often on the basis of little more than hearsay. In reporting such scandals, Portas personally targeted the then prime-minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva and most of his ministers (1985–1995) thus making several enemies in the PSD. Although it reached very respectable circulation levels in the 1990s, &quot;O Independente&quot; never quite reached Portas&#x27;s stated objective of outselling the leading Portuguese weekly &quot;Expresso&quot; and eventually folded in 2006.

In the 1990s Portas became a TV personality appearing regularly on several Portuguese TV channels as a political commentator. He was a sporadic panel member in a popular weekly night TV talk show (&quot;Raios e Coriscos&quot;) and in the Portuguese edition of &quot;Crossfire&quot;. In 2006, after his first stint as a government minister, he returned to TV with his own biweekly show (&quot;O Estado da Arte&quot;) where he commented on current issues.

==Political career==

===The formative years, 1974–85===
Paulo Portas showed a interest in politics and as a child engaged in lively political discussions with his elders. In 1975 he joined the youth wing of the Democratic Popular Party (PPD), which in 1976 became PSD Social Democratic Party. He would later profess to have been a staunch follower of PPD&#x27;s founder Francisco Sá Carneiro, who is said to have relished the views of the 14-year-old Paulo Portas and personally sponsored his full PSD membership in 1978. Sá Carneiro died in 1980 and, following a bitter loss in an internal election of the party&#x27;s youth-wing JSD, Portas quietly left PSD in 1982. He remained involved with politics through his popular opinion-columns in the conservative weekly newspapers &quot;O Tempo&quot; and &quot;Semanário&quot;.

===Early political career, 1986–97===
Paulo Portas took his first big step into politics in 1986 with his personal endorsement of presidential candidate Diogo Freitas do Amaral, in support of whom Portas, already a well-known media pundit, campaigned with determination. However, Freitas do Amaral lost the election and Portas stepped back from politics to launch the &quot;O Independente&quot; newspaper project and became its Deputy-Director. By the 1990s he was a widely recognized national figure and stated more than once on TV that he &quot;did not want to be a politician&quot; but it would later become apparent that he was, on the contrary, moving full speed towards becoming Portugal&#x27;s leading conservative politician. He is credited with helping his former University colleague Manuel Monteiro gain the leadership of the Centro Democrático Social (CDS) party in 1992 and with coming up with new strategies, such as rebranding the CDS as the People&#x27;s Party (CDS-PP) in line with several of the major conservative European parties. In 1995, Portas formally joined the CDS-PP with the full support of Manuel Monteiro, who put him at the top of the party list in the district of Aveiro thus ensuring that he would become a member of the Portuguese Parliament in that year&#x27;s legislative elections. In 1997 he ran and was elected member of the municipal chamber of Oliveira de Azeméis.

===Affirmation as party leader, 1998–2001===
In 1998, after the CDS-PP performed poorly in the 1997 local elections, Portas made his move to control the party by first manoeuvering to get Manuel Monteiro to resign, and then by defeating his hand-picked successor who underestimated Portas by comparing him to Mickey Mouse. On 22 March 1998, Portas finally became President of the CDS-PP after a bitter take-over that established Portas&#x27;s reputation as a cunning politician who does not hesitate to remove those who stand in his way even if they had formerly been his friends or allies.

Upon taking over the CDS-PP, he immediately sought to energize the party and earn himself name recognition by campaigning in more media-friendly ways and soon became known by his appearances in public events that earned him the nickname &quot;Paulie of the Market Fairs&quot; (in Portuguese: &quot;Paulinho das Feiras&quot;). He is also said to have brought in political marketing experts to enhance his image and that of the party. He was a leading voice against Portugal&#x27;s &quot;regionalization&quot; and &quot;legalization of abortion&quot; in two 1998 referendums that did not come to pass. In 1999, he headed the CDS-PP list to the European Parliament, got elected but only remained in Brussels less than six months. In 2001 he ran for Mayor of Lisbon and was soundly defeated, but got enough votes to be elected member of the City Council. Despite running under the slogan &quot;I shall remain&quot; (in Portuguese: &quot;Eu fico&quot;), he left City Council shortly afterwards to focus on the 2002 elections.

In 1993, Paulo Portas said of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa that he was an unreliable source for &quot;O Independente&#x27;s&quot;, and had given an account of a political VIP dinner that had never taken place going as far as inventing that the soup served during the dinner was Vichyssoise. Later, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 1999 when he was leader of Portugal&#x27;s Social Democratic Party (PSD), sought an elections alliance with Paulo Portas&#x27;s CDS-PP that was initially agreed but collapsed shortly. Marcelo then had to resign from the PSD leadership.

===Minister of Defence, 2002-05===

In the 2002 legislative elections, the CDS-PP won 8.7 percent of the vote and 14 Parliament seats, which were sufficient to form a government majority with the PSD that won the election. The CDS-PP participated in two coalition governments from April 2002 to March 2005 and Portas served as Minister of State and National Defence in the first (Durão Barroso) and Minister of State, National Defence and Maritime Affairs in the second (Pedro Santana Lopes). As Minister of Defence, he presided over important reforms of the military, such as abolishing conscription, but his most lasting legacy was the upgrade of military equipment in the context of the 2003 &quot;Military Programming Law&quot; that envisaged a major boost in military equipment spending to 5,341 million euros, including two submarines and 260 combat vehicles that would become the subject of much controversy after he left office. As Minister of Defense, Paulo Portas was also determinant in aligning Portugal with George W. Bush&#x27;s 2003 Iraq invasion by saying he had personally &quot;seen irrefutable evidence of weapons of mass destruction&quot; while on an official visit to Washington. He was subsequently awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service by the USA&#x27;s Defense Department.

===Back in Parliament, 2006–11===
In the 2005 early elections, the two incumbent coalition parties suffered a crushing defeat, with CDS-PP losing 60,000 votes and two of its fourteen seats in Parliament. Paulo Portas assumed the responsibility for the defeat and resigned from the party leadership but not from his seat in parliament. He failed to get his preferred successor (Telmo Correia) elected, but some of his staunchest party allies managed to remain in control of the party&#x27;s Directorate (the &quot;National Congress&quot;) setting the stage for Paulo Portas to return in 2007 in what his brief successor José Ribeiro e Castro called &quot;a coup d&#x27;etat.&quot; Paulo Portas had accused Ribeiro Castro of being an ineffective absentee leader (for keeping his post at the European Parliament) and called for party elections open to all CDS-PP supporters gambling that he would capture the support of the less involved party members. Ribeiro e Castro questioned the legality of Portas&#x27; challenge but, in April 2007, he was soundly defeated by Portas who got 70% of the militants&#x27; votes and would remain as CDS-PP president until 2016. For the next six years, Paulo Portas led his party in the opposition to the ruling Socialist Party (PS). His new strategy for the party was to focus on a few major issues (such as agriculture, tax cuts, fuel prices) in order for CDS-PP to retain conservative voters, who, in the past, supported CDS-PP but voted PSD at election time. In 2009 he personally ran for local office in the small municipality of Arouca (population: 20,000) and was elected to the Municipal Assembly significantly boosting CDS-PP&#x27;s votes in the region. In 2006–07, just prior to regaining the party leadership, Paulo Portas again had been a leading &#x27;No!&#x27; voice against the legalization of abortion in Portugal in the 2007 referendum that was won by the &quot;Yes!&quot; vote that reversed the &quot;No!&quot; outcome of the 1998 referendum.

===Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, 2011–13===

In the 2011 elections, Portas&#x27;s opposition strategies paid off and the CDS-PP achieved its best result in 30 years: 11.7% of the total vote. The winning party, the PSD, needed the CDS-PP to reach a parliamentary majority and the two parties formed a coalition government. By his own choice, Portas became Minister of State and of Foreign Affairs and secured two more minister slots for the CDS-PP, including the Minister of Agriculture position for his youthful female protégée Assunção Cristas, who would five years later succeed Portas in the CDS-PP party&#x27;s leadership. As minister, Portas chose (and relished) devoting himself fully to performing his official functions, in particular traveling abroad. He made his priority what he called &quot;economic diplomacy&quot;, meaning the generation through diplomacy of business opportunities abroad for Portuguese companies. To that effect, he wrestled control of the Portuguese Foreign Investment and Trade Agency (AICEP) from the Ministry of Economics. In 2013, to attract foreign investments, Paulo Portas instituted &quot;golden visas&quot; to make it possible for non-EU foreigners to obtain Portuguese residency if they invested at least 500,000 euros in Portuguese real estate. By focusing on his duties as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he also managed to distance himself from the difficult decisions related to Portugal&#x27;s economic austerity program. More than once he kept silent or expressed his disagreement with unpopular measures taken by the government to which he belonged, and on 2 July 2013 he abruptly resigned in protest at the appointment of a Finance Minister (Maria Luís Albuquerque) he did not approve of, a decision he called &quot;irrevocable&quot; but that he subsequently revoked.

===Deputy Prime-Minister, 2013–15===
When Paulo Portas resigned from the government in July 2013, Prime-Minister Passos Coelho feared the end of his coalition government and negotiated with Paulo Portas his permanence in a higher capacity as Deputy Prime Minister with oversight over economic issues. Paulo Portas also obtained control of the Ministry of Economy where he placed two close associates: minister António Pires de Lima (his close childhood friend) and state secretary Adolfo Mesquita Nunes (his youthful protégé in the CDS-PP party). In control of the key ministries of Economics, Agriculture, Labor and Social Security (held by his CDS-PP ministers), Paulo Portas came to wield political power far beyond the 12% of the national vote his party received in the 2011 elections. As part of his Deputy Prime-Minister attributions, Paulo Portas took charge of the negotiations on Portugal&#x27;s IMF/EC/ECB-supported program, the terms of which he had publicly declared to be against. However, his only visible act of defiance was the setting up, in December 2013, of a &quot;countdown clock&quot; showing the time remaining until the expiration of the program on 17 May 2014. Through the rest of his mandate that ended in 2015, he raised no major new policy proposals or objections in his capacity as Deputy Prime-Minister, choosing instead to use his economic policy oversight position to travel the world promoting Portuguese companies and products in what appears to have been a continuation of the &quot;economic diplomacy&quot; priority he had established as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

In 2015 Paulo Portas agreed to an electoral alliance between his CDS-PP party and its government coalition partner PSD party as to jointly maximize their numbers of elected members of Parliament on 4 October 2015 Portuguese legislative elections. The alliance (PAF, &quot;Portugal in Front&quot;) came first in the elections but fell short of a parliamentary majority. Despite upfront opposition from the new majority-holding parties, the PAF alliance accepted to form a minority government and Paulo Portas was re-conducted on 30 October 2015 as Deputy Prime Minister of Portugal&#x27;s XX Constitutional Government. However, he stayed in office less than a month as his government&#x27;s program was predictably rejected in Parliament and replaced by a Socialist Party government supported by the far-left parties.

===Retirement from CDS-PP Party Leadership, 2016===
Having ceased his functions as Deputy Prime-Minister on 26 November 2015, Paulo Portas presented himself in Parliament the following day to take up the position for which he had been elected on 4 October by the Lisbon electoral district. However, one month later (28 December 2015) he announced his resignation from the CDS-PP Party leadership and from his elected position in Parliament on the grounds that &quot;it was time for a new political cycle (...) and for a new generation&quot; to take over the party leadership. Accordingly, on 13 March 2016, Paulo Portas stepped down in acclaim at a special convention of his CDS-PP party where he was replaced by his longtime protégée and former government colleague Assunção Cristas. Shortly afterwards, he became vice-president of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce—a non-remunerated position that allowed him to continue traveling to promote Portuguese enterprises abroad as he had been doing in the government. He left Parliament in June 2016 to return to political commentary on TV with a weekly show on TVI Portugal.

==Controversies==
===Ministry of Defence===

In 2002, Portas became Minister of Defence and made a historic seafront fort of São Julião da Barra his &quot;official residence&quot;. Paulo Portas was the first Minister of Defence to openly move into the fort, which resulted in the closing of most of the historic monument to the public and in new remodeling and upkeep costs for Portas&#x27;s occupancy. He defended his move to the fort as &quot;a gain for the State.&quot; Upon becoming Minister of Defence in 2002, Paulo Portas also rescinded a previous contract for the purchase of nine EC-635 helicopters from European manufacturer Eurocopter Group on the grounds that the helicopters had not been delivered when stipulated. He then considered rescinding another existing contract for the purchase of twelve helicopters NH-90, manufactured by Nato Helicopters Industries (a subsidiary of Eurocopter Group) and buy American-made Blackhawk helicopters instead but he eventually authorized the NH-90 helicopters purchase in the amount of 420 million euros. Paulo Portas then went ahead with the purchase of twelve EH101 helicopters from manufacturer AgustaWestland at a total cost of 300 million euros for Portugal. However the purchase price for the EH101s did not include their maintenance, which subsequently added an extra 120 million euros to the price and raised questions on whether the helicopter deals were in the best interests of Portugal both in terms of the high cost and the multiple configurations.

===The &quot;irrevocable&quot; resignation from Cabinet===
In 2013, when Portas resigned &quot;from the Government&quot; he stated in his press communiqué that his resignation was &quot;irrevocable&quot; but then agreed to stay on in the government in a higher capacity as Deputy Prime-Minister. Portas&#x27; resignation was reported to be an impulsive but genuine gesture of protest, to distance himself from an increasingly unpopular government that went awry. Portas explained his change of mind about resigning saying he &quot;preferred to pay a reputation price for a better future&quot; and that &quot;the country comes first.&quot;

==Personal life==
Portas is a lifelong bachelor, who has never publicly assumed a romantic relationship and who invariably attends his many official functions unescorted or in the casual company of socialite women known to be attached to other men. He has no children but has expressed his wish to &quot;become a father one day.&quot; Portas is known to be a fan of Parov Stelar, a well-known Electro swing musician, and a supporter of Lisbon football team Sporting Clube de Portugal. He is also reported to be a compulsive cigarette smoker, a cinephile and a history-buff.

<doc id="888846" wikidata="Q440211" url="?curid=888846" title="(6178) 1986 DA">
<text> is a metallic asteroid, classified as near-Earth object of the Amor group, approximately 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 February 1986, by Japanese astronomer Minoru Kizawa at Shizuoka Observatory, Japan.

1986 DA was the first near Earth asteroid thought to be of metallic composition, with high radar brightness; with that it was predicted to have 100 thousand tons of platinum group metals including gold and suggested as a resource for future space colonists.

== Orbit and classification ==

As an eccentric Amor asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of and approaches the orbit of Earth from the outside but does not cross it. It crosses however the orbit of Mars and can be classified as a Mars-crosser and also approaches the orbit of Jupiter within 0.5 AU. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.5 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,732 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.58 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Siding Spring Observatory in 1977, extending the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc by 9 years prior to its discovery.

== Physical characteristics ==

The metallic M-type asteroid is notable for being significantly more radar-reflective than other asteroids. Radar measurements suggest it is composed of nickel and iron and that it was derived from the center of a much larger object that experienced melting and differentiation. The observed radar albedo was 0.58 and the optical albedo was 0.14.

=== Rotation and shape ===

It was most probably formed from a larger body through a catastrophic collision with another object. Radar measurements of this body indicate that the surface is relatively smooth on scales of less than a meter, but it is highly irregular on scales of 10–100 meters. Several lightcurve analysis gave it a concurring rotation period of 3.50 to 3.51 hours with a relatively high brightness amplitude between 0.03 and 0.48 in magnitude, indicating an irregular shape ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.08 and 0.16, and a diameter of 3.1 to 3.2 kilometers, respectively. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; selects 3.15 kilometers as best result, while the first estimate from 1994 gave a diameter of 2.3 kilometers.

=== Mining considerations ===

The asteroid achieved its most notable recognition when scientists revealed that it contained over &quot;10,000 tons of gold and 100,000 tons of platinum&quot;, or an approximate value at the time of its discovery of &quot;$90 billion for the gold and a cool trillion dollars for the platinum, plus loose change for the asteroid&#x27;s 10 billion tons of iron and a billion tons of nickel.&quot; In 2024 the estimated value of 100,000 tons of platinum was worth approximately 3.4 trillion US dollars. The delta-v for a spacecraft rendezvous with this asteroid from low Earth orbit is 7.1 km/s.

<text>U.S. Route 43 (US 43) is a north–south United States Highway in the Southern states of Alabama and Tennessee. It travels from Prichard, Alabama, to Columbia, Tennessee. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is in Prichard, at an intersection with US 90, and its northern terminus is in Columbia at an intersection with US 31/US 412/US 412 Bus.

In Alabama and Tennessee, all of the U.S. Highways in each state have one or more unsigned state highways designated along its length. US 43 travels concurrently with Alabama State Route 13 (SR 13) from its southern terminus to an intersection in southeastern Fayette County. For the rest of its length in the state, US 43 is concurrent with signed state highways. In Tennessee, US 43 travels concurrently with Tennessee State Route 6 (SR 6) along its entire length in the state. It also has an unsigned concurrency with SR 227 between Saint Joseph and Loretto.

==Route description==

===Alabama===
US 43 begins along Telegraph Road in Prichard, Alabama, at the point where US 90 crosses over Telegraph Road; a short connector road joins the two highways nearby. It travels northward toward Chickasaw on a three-lane road that features one lane in each direction and a center turning lane. Upon intersecting the Craft Highway in Chickasaw, the roadway adds another lane in each direction. As it enters Saraland, the highway meets State Route 158 (SR 158), which connects to Interstate 65 (I-65) to the west. Farther north in the town, it meets SR 213. It continues north and then crosses I-65 on the northern edge of Satsuma. US 43 continues north on a four-lane divided highway that runs roughly parallel to the meandering Mobile River. A trumpet interchange near Calvert provides access to a steel mill between the highway and the river. In McIntosh, the highway passes Andrews Chapel, a historic log church. North of McIntosh, the highway runs through forest land; clearings dot the roadside occasionally. At Wagarville, the highway intersects SR 56, which travels west toward Chatom. Near Jackson, the road crosses the Tombigbee River just before an intersection with SR 177. SR 177 serves as a business route for US 43 as it passes through downtown Jackson. A connector road on either side of US 43 links the highway to SR 69, which passes over the four-lane road. SR 177 intersects US 43 again as it leaves Jackson. US 43 curves to the northeast as it heads toward Grove Hill. There, SR 295 splits off to the east and passes through the town. Shortly thereafter, the highway meets US 84 at a diamond interchange. SR 295 rejoins US 43 on the northern end of Grove Hill. Roughly halfway between Grove Hill and Thomasville, SR 178 connects Fulton to the highway system. Near the center of Thomasville, the road meets SR 154, which heads southwest toward Coffeeville. In northern Thomasville, US 43 splits away from the roadway, which continues as SR 5. Instead, US 43 heads northwesterly until it intersects SR 10 at Dixons Mills.
US 43 continues northward from Dixons Mills along a winding road that leads to Linden. There, it meets SR 69, which came from the southwest. The two highways travel together through Linden, where they are overlapped briefly by SR 28. When the highways reach Providence, the two roads fork and US 43 takes the western leg; SR 69 heads north toward Greensboro. It then curves slightly to the northwest and meets US 80 in southeastern Demopolis. The two routes head west together for about before US 43 turns back to the north. The highway passes by the town square and in between the Tombigbee and Black Warrior Rivers before crossing the latter. North of Demopolis, it follows a two-lane road that passes through wooded farmland that clears as the road goes north. When the highway reaches Eutaw, it joins up with SR 14, which comes from Greensboro to the southeast. In the middle of town, the two routes meet northbound U.S. Route 11 in Alabama at the Greene County Courthouse Square District; southbound US 11 goes around the other side of the block, effectively making the courthouse square its median. The three routes only share one block before SR 14 departs to the west and the other two routes head in the opposite direction. Outside of Eutaw, the roadway curves around to the north and it runs a parallel course to I-20/I-59, though a few miles offset. At Knoxville, the two U.S. Highways cross over the two Interstate Highways, after which, US 43 and US 11 travel on the north side of the interstates until reaching Tuscaloosa. In southwestern Tuscaloosa, the two highways cross the Joe Mallisham Parkway, which serves as a western bypass of Tuscaloosa and Northport. Just south of downtown Tuscaloosa, US 43 and US 11 diverge at an interchange with SR 69, which also happens to be the northern end of I-359. SR 69 descends from the elevated highway and joins US 43 on Lurleen B. Wallace Parkway through the downtown area and past the historic Bama Theatre. The northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a block until they join to cross the Black Warrior River on the Hugh R. Thomas Bridge just above the Oliver Dam and then enter Northport. Shortly after crossing the river is an interchange with 5th Street. The highways ease to the north and continue until reaching US 82. There, SR 69 continues to the north while US 43 turns west onto US 82. These two highways head west for a short distance before US 43 turns away to the northwest. The highway curves back around to head northeast as it intersects SR 171. Farther north in Northport, US 43 meets the end of the Tuscaloosa–Northport western bypass.
It crosses over an arm of Lake Tuscaloosa and travels along the western edge of Binion Creek Landing Park. It winds to the north-northwest and intersects SR 18. At this intersection, US 43 ends its southern concurrency with SR 13 and begins a concurrency with SR 18. Also, SR 13 becomes a signed highway at this intersection. US 43 and SR 18 wind to the north-northeast and enter Bankston and later pass through Stough. Approximately after crossing the Sipsey River the highways enter Fayette where they intersect SR 171 (2nd Avenue Southeast) in the downtown area. At this intersection, SR 18 continues to the west-northwest on Columbus Street West and US 43 and SR 171 travel to the north-northeast on 2nd Avenue Northeast. North of Fayette, the two highways intersect the southern terminus of SR 129 and the western terminus of SR 102 shortly thereafter. They curve to the north-northwest and then briefly travel through the Fayette State Experiment Forest. The highways curve to the north-northeast and enter Winfield. They cross over some railroad tracks of BNSF Railway before intersecting SR 118 (Bankhead Highway) and the southern terminus of SR 253. US 43, SR 118, and SR 171 travel concurrently to the northwest toward Gu-Win and Guin. They pass a 3M plant before they intersect the western terminus of SR 44 (7th Street) in Guin. The highways intersect US 278 (unsigned SR 74) and the eastern terminus of SR 142 (11th Avenue West) in downtown Guin. At this intersection, SR 118 turns south onto US 278 west, and US 43 and SR 171 turn north onto US 278 east; the three highways travel to the north-northwest. Between Guin and Hamilton, they have an interchange with I-22/US 78. They cross over the Buttahatchee River as they enter Hamilton. They intersect SR 17 south of the downtown area. At this intersection, SR 171 ends and SR 17 joins the US 43/US 278 concurrency. At Bexar Avenue West, US 278 turns east, while US 43 and SR 17 continue to the north. The highways curve back to the northeast and intersect the southern terminus of SR 187. They enter Hackleburg and in the main part of town is an intersection with SR 172 and the southern terminus of SR 253 (Clay Street). They then continue to the north and intersect SR 13 for a second time northwest of Phil Campbell. They enter Russellville and have an interchange with SR 24.

The three highways head to the north and pass the King Drive-In theater, the oldest, continually-operating theater in the state. They travel northeast through Littleville and then northwest towards Tuscumbia. They have an intersection with US 72 (unsigned SR 2), US 72 Alt., and SR 20. At this intersection, US 72 Alternate ends, while US 72 and SR 20 join the US 43/SR 13/SR 17 concurrency. The five highways continue to the north, briefly travel through Tuscumbia proper before traveling along the Tuscumbia–Muscle Shoals city line. On the Muscle Shoals–Sheffield city line, the highways intersect East 2nd Street, which carries SR 184 east of the intersection. They then pass administration offices of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Then, they cross over the Tennessee River on the O&#x27;Neal Bridge and enter Lauderdale County. The US 43/US 72/SR 13/SR 17/SR 20 concurrency immediately enters Florence. It has an incomplete interchange where SR 20 leaves the concurrency to the west-southwest on Coffee Road. There is no direct access from SR 20 to US 43 north/US 72 east/SR 13 north/SR 17 north. The highways pass near University of North Alabama&#x27;s main campus and travel to the northeast. There is an interchange with SR 157 (Helton Drive). At this interchange, SR 17 departs the concurrency and heads northwest with SR 157. After that, they intersect SR 133 (Cox Creek Parkway). Just west-southwest of Killen, US 72 continues to the east-northeast, while US 43 and SR 13 head to the northeast. US 43 and SR 13 curve to the north and intersect SR 64. They continue to the north and east until they reach the Tennessee state line, where SR 13 ends.

===Tennessee===
US 43 enters Lawrence County and the city limits of Saint Joseph. The unsigned State Route 6 (SR 6) begins at the state line. In the main part of the city, US 43 begins an unsigned concurrency with SR 227 (Iron City Road). They curve to the northeast, leave Saint Joseph, and enter Loretto. There, SR 227 splits off to the southeast onto East Main Street (Lexington Highway). Then, US 43 intersects SR 98 (Rabbit Trail Road) in Leoma. It has an interchange with US 64 (unsigned SR 15; Lawrenceburg Highway) in Lawrenceburg. In downtown Lawrenceburg, US 43 intersects US 64 Bus. (Gaines Street). The highway runs through Lawrenceburg Proper and into the Ethridge City Limits. There are instersections with Ethridge-Redhill Road Tennessee State Route 938 to the West, and Campbellsville Pike Tennessee State Route 940 to the East. 
The highway begins a curve to the north, crossing the South Fork of the Buffalo River. Shortly after intersecting with the South end of Old Highway 43, the highway crosses over the North Fork of the Buffalo River. Next it intersects with the North end of Old Highway 43 at the junction with SR 240 (Monument Road). 

In Maury County, US 43 intersects SR 20, then it intersects with the South end of Lawrenceburg Highway (the former route of Highway 43). After that junction, it passes by Stillhouse Hollow Falls, a Class I Scenic-Recreational State Natural Area 
(https://www.tn.gov/environment/program-areas/na-natural-areas/natural-areas-middle-region/middle-region/na-na-stillhouse-hollow-falls.html)
The highway continues over Big Bigby Creek and to the junction with the North end of Lawrenceburg Highway. 

It intersects the southern terminus of SR 243 (South Main Street) in Mount Pleasant. It travels on an overpass over Mt. Joy Road and some railroad tracks. US 43 bypasses downtown by traveling through the western part of the city. It intersects SR 166 (1st Avenue). Then, it has an interchange with SR 243, which also leads to the Maury County Airport. It has an interchange with US 412 (unsigned SR 99) and the western terminus of US 412 Bus. (Hampshire Pike) in Columbia. At this interchange, US 43 and US 412 travel concurrently to the north-northeast. At an interchange with SR 50 (Williamsport Pike), the concurrency briefly re-enters the city before leaving again. The concurrency curves to the east-southeast and has an interchange with SR 7 (Santa Fe Pike). Then, they intersect US 31 and US 412 Bus (Nashville Highway). Here, US 43 ends, US 412 continues to the east-southeast on Bear Creek Pike, and SR 6 turns onto US 31 north.

==History==
Prior to the completion of Corridor X in western Alabama, US 43 and US 278 shared a concurrency with US 78 between Guin and Hamilton. 

===1934 proposed expansion===

In 1934 as part of a proposal to eliminate the US 31W and US 31E spilt, US 43 was to be extended north to Hopkinsville, Kentucky on US 31 and modern day US 41A. A highway numbered US 143 was also to be commissioned to replace US 31E to Glasgow, Kentucky. This plan received pushback from the states involved, and the plan was scrapped.

==Future==
Preliminary talks have indicated that Alabama state officials support a plan to upgrade US 43 to Interstate Highway standards from the Mobile metropolitan area to the I-20/I-59 interchange in Knoxville, Alabama (southwest of Tuscaloosa). No number has been assigned. The plan is estimated to cost roughly $1.6 billion. The project is expected to help the economies of cities in the Black Belt by connecting communities in western Alabama, the Port of Mobile, I-65, and I-20/I-59.

A corresponding website is used to supplement the magazine with blogs and other items which cannot be provided in the paper format, such as audio-video presentations.

In 1993, Modern Drummer Publications introduced a bimonthly drum dealer-oriented magazine called &quot;Drum Business,&quot; and for more than 20 years its book division has released works by drum educators. In 2006 the company published its first hardcover book on the history of drumming, entitled &quot;The Drummer: 100 Years Of Rhythmic Power And Invention&quot;. Since 1987 it has also produced the Modern Drummer Festival.

==History==
&quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine was conceived in the basement of Ron and Isabel Spagnardi&#x27;s home in Nutley, New Jersey, funded only with the family&#x27;s personal savings. The magazine&#x27;s initial staff consisted of Leo Spagnardi (Ron&#x27;s father, who taught him how to play the drums), and Ron and Isabel&#x27;s daughter, Lori. Although they had no real publication experience or financial backing, the Spagnardis placed ads in local newspapers, in &quot;Downbeat,&quot; and in &quot;Drum World.&quot;

&quot;What we didn&#x27;t consider when we put the ads in the papers,&quot; recalled Isabel in &quot;The Drummer,&quot; &quot;was that we were innocently breaking the law by advertising a product that didn&#x27;t even exist yet!&quot; The ads worked, however, and subscriptions began coming in as the first issue was still being laid out on the Spagnardis&#x27; ping-pong table. Ron contributed most of the magazine&#x27;s content, writing the majority of the articles on an old typewriter under various pen names. Within two years, the Spagnardis&#x27; basement could no longer provide the necessary space and so moved to its first proper office in Clifton, New Jersey. By 1984, the magazine once again outgrew its headquarters and moved to a larger facility in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. Ten years later, it moved to an even larger facility in the same town. The publication is now based in Boca Raton, Florida.

Ron Spagnardi died on September 22, 2003. David Frangioni became Publisher in 2019 and then CEO/Owner in 2020.

==&quot;Drum Business&quot; and book publishing==
In 1993 Modern Drummer Publications introduced &quot;Drum Business&quot;, a magazine dedicated to the needs of drum retailers. The bi-monthly publication features interviews with drum sellers, press releases for new products, drum-industry news, articles and news such as on the annual National Association of Merchant Musicians (NAMM) convention.

Among the books Modern Drummer Publications has released are titles by well-known drummers such as Gary Chester, Carl Palmer and Bill Bruford. Ron Spagnardi authored more than a dozen books.

==Readers poll==
Each year &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; publishes the results of its readers poll, which highlights top drummers spanning all genres of music and inducts one drummer into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame. Awards are also given for top educational materials and recorded performances.

<doc id="888859" wikidata="Q219908" url="?curid=888859" title="Concentric zone model">
<text>The concentric zone model, also known as the Burgess model or the CCD model, is one of the earliest theoretical models to explain urban social structures. It was created by sociologist Ernest Burgess in 1925.

==The model==
Based on human ecology theory done by Burgess and applied on Chicago, it was the first to give the explanation of distribution of social groups within urban areas. This concentric ring model depicts urban land usage in concentric rings: the Central Business District (or CBD) was in the middle of the model, and the city is expanded in rings with different land uses. It is effectively an urban version of Von Thünen&#x27;s regional land use model developed a century earlier. It influenced the later development of Homer Hoyt&#x27;s sector model (1939) and Harris and Ullman&#x27;s multiple nuclei model (1945).

The zones identified are: 
# The center with the central business district,
# The transition zone of mixed residential and commercial uses or the zone of transition,
# Working class residential homes (inner suburbs), in later decades called inner city or zone of independent working men&#x27;s home,
# Better quality middle-class homes (outer suburbs) or zone of better housing,
# Commuter zone, high-class homes on outskirts of outer suburbs - homeowner can afford to commute to central business district.

The model is more detailed than the traditional down-mid-uptown divide by which downtown is the CBD, uptown the affluent residential outer ring, and midtown in between.

Burgess&#x27;s work helped generate the bid rent curve. This theory states that the concentric circles are based on the amount that people will pay for the land. This value is based on the profits that are obtainable from maintaining a business on that land. The center of the town will have the highest number of customers so it is profitable for retail activities. Manufacturing will pay slightly less for the land as they are only interested in the accessibility for workers, &#x27;goods in&#x27; and &#x27;goods out&#x27;. Residential land use will take the surrounding land.

==Criticisms==
The model has been challenged by many contemporary urban geographers. First, the model does not work well with cities outside the United States, in particular with those developed under different historical contexts. Even in the United States, because of changes such as advancement in transportation and information technology and transformation in global economy, cities are no longer organized with clear &quot;zones&quot; (see: Los Angeles School of Urban Analysis).

* It describes the peculiar American geography, where the inner city is poor while suburbs are wealthy; the inverse is the norm elsewhere.
* It assumes an isotropic plane – an even, unchanging landscape.
** Physical features – land may restrict growth of certain sectors; hills and water features may make some locations unusually desirable for residential purposes.
* Commuter villages defy the theory, being a distant part of the commuter zone. 
* Decentralization of shops, manufacturing industry (see Industrial suburb), and entertainment.
* Urban regeneration and gentrification – more expensive property can be found in formerly &#x27;low class&#x27; housing areas.
* Many new housing estates were built on the edges of cities in Britain.
* It does not address local urban politics and forces of globalization.
* The model does not fit , for example Stoke-on-Trent.

<doc id="888861" wikidata="Q2911380" url="?curid=888861" title="Borys Wrzesnewskyj">
<text>Borys Wrzesnewskyj ( ; born November 10, 1960) is a Canadian politician who represented the riding of Etobicoke Centre in the House of Commons of Canada. He held the riding from 2004 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2019. He is a member of the Liberal Party.

==Background==
Wrzesnewskyj was born in Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada (now a part of Toronto). He is a third-generation Ukrainian Canadian, of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, and partly Polish from paternal family. He attended Humber Valley Village Public School and Upper Canada College. He received a Bachelor of Commerce from Trinity College, University of Toronto and has been a member of Plast. He speaks English, Ukrainian, Polish, French, and Spanish. He is the owner of Future Bakery, founded by his grandparents, and M-C Dairy.

==Humanitarian work==
Wrzesnewskyj is known for his humanitarian work both in his riding of Etobicoke Centre and abroad, including helping children causes in Ukraine. Through Future Bakery, Wrzesnewskyj was one of the original sponsors of the &quot;Out of the Cold&quot; program to aid the homeless and numerous other charitable organizations working in a number of Toronto&#x27;s most challenging neighbourhoods.

In the late 1980s he helped organize and finance the nascent People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (also known as Rukh). In 1991, financed and organized a group in support of the referendum for the independence of Ukraine. One of his projects was an underground printing press which produced and distributed several million pieces of pro-independence literature in the South and East of Ukraine. Throughout the 1990s, he was involved with various civil society and humanitarian projects in Ukraine, such as the building of libraries and providing scholarships for gifted students.

Through his family foundation, Wrzesnewskyj has provided funding support for the following:

* The Ukraine Transparency and Election Monitoring Project to train independent election scrutineers in Ukraine.
* The Ukraine List electronic periodical of the Chair of Ukrainian Studies (University of Ottawa) targeting policy specialists and academics.
* The delivery of Ukrainian News to every MP and Senator in Canada&#x27;s Parliament.
* The publication and delivery of Ukraine Analyst to members of the Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group.
* Ukrainian courses at The Centre for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies (CERES) at the University of Toronto.
* Grants for archival research into Ukrainian national movements during World War II.
* The republication of books about Ukrainians who perished in the Holocaust.
* Archival research into victims of the Holocaust and Soviet terror in the Sambir region of Ukraine.
* Donated $500,000 to build the Ukrainian Canadian Care Centre (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
* Annually sponsored an intern from Ukraine to participate in an internship program in Canada&#x27;s Parliament (Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Program).
* Donated $250,000 to finance election observers for the first round of voting in Ukraine.
* Self-funded missions to Sudan, Darfur, Somalia, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.
* Lead the Ukrainian Canadian community&#x27;s fundraising effort for famine relief in Somalia during the 2011 Horn of Africa famine, with $100,000 committed.
* Donated $100,000 to the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv, Ukraine.
* In 2014 he sponsored the publication of &quot;This Blessed Land: Crimea and the Crimean Tatars&quot; by Paul Robert Magocsi

In December 2010, he created the &quot;Roman Wrzesnewskyj Polish Endowment Fund&quot; with a $35,000 donation toward the preservation and development of advanced Polish language studies at the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of Toronto. Additionally, each Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day, he donates his time by delivering toys and gifts to children in community housing projects in Etobicoke Centre.

==Politics==
Wrzesnewskyj was actively involved in the Canadian delegation to the contested Ukrainian election of 2004, Orange Revolution, and has often spoken to Canadian media on its behalf. Then, Canadian Prime Minister, Paul Martin said that he was personally briefed by him to publicly warn Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;hands off the Ukrainian election&quot; in the House of Commons of Canada which fundamentally shifted Canada&#x27;s position (Wrzesnewskyj telephoned Martin from Kyiv during the Orange Revolution). Originally, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade in Ottawa took a &quot;hands off&quot; approach to the contested Ukrainian election. Martin says that he, and the Government of Canada would not have stood up for democracy in Ukraine &quot;if it hadn&#x27;t been for Borys&quot;. Subsequently, he was instrumental in securing the Government of Canada&#x27;s commitment to sending five hundred Canadian election observers to the December 2004 Presidential elections in Ukraine.

===Legislative work===

His House of Commons legislative work saw the introduction of several private member&#x27;s bills and motions including:

* Bill C-180, &quot;An Act to amend the Criminal Code (hate propaganda)&quot;, 6 May 2009; Bill C-181, &quot;An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking and transplanting human organs and other body parts)&quot;, 7 May 2009.
* Bill C-383, &quot;An Act respecting education benefits for spouses and children of certain deceased federal enforcement officers&quot;, 12 May 2009.
* Bill C-394 &quot;An Act to acknowledge that persons of Croatian origin were interned in Canada during the First World War and to provide for recognition of this event&quot;, 26 May 2009. This began as his Private Members&#x27; Bill C-374, which the &quot;Winnipeg Sun&quot; placed this item in its top ten list of bills (9 November 2006).
* Bill C-450, &quot;An Act respecting a national day of remembrance of the Ukrainian Holodomor-Genocide&quot;.
* Bill C-537, &quot;An Act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial interim release for offenses involving firearms)&quot; to toughen up bail conditions for perpetrators of crimes involving guns, June 2010.

Regarding Bill C-181, Wrzesnewskyj gave a press conference in Ottawa together with David Matas and David Kilgour, authors of &quot;Bloody Harvest: Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China&quot;. While saying that &quot;consumers benefit from trade with China&quot;, and that &quot;Canada would like to do more trade with China&quot;, he asserted &quot;it does not exonerate us for addressing the issue of Organ transplantation in China&quot; and questioned &quot;trusting a country that would engage in this sort of horrific crime against its own people.&quot;

Wrzesnewskyj helped pass MP James Bezan&#x27;s Bill C-459, An Act to establish a Ukrainian Famine and Genocide Memorial Day and to recognize the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33 as an act of genocide, at all stages through the House of Commons and Senate.

He also worked with MP Bob Rae to introduce and help pass unanimously through the House of Commons the Black Ribbon Day motion establishing an annual Canadian Day of Remembrance for the victims of Nazi and Soviet Communist regimes on August 23, called &quot;Black Ribbon Day&quot;, to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the infamous pact between the Nazi and Soviet Communist regimes.

===Committees - House of Commons===

In 2010, Wrzesnewskyj served as vice-chair on two committees: (1) Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, (2) Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure on the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration.

Between 2004 and 2010, he served as member on eleven committees, including Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and Standing Committee on Transport among others.

Wrzesnewskyj discussed the importance of Ukraine&#x27;s accession to NATO at meetings of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe parliamentary assembly meetings and official meetings of NATO member states. He was later selected as an official member of the delegation of the Speaker of the House of Commons to Ukraine (a trip geared toward developing relations between Canada and Ukraine).

He helped the previous Canadian government to negotiate and sign the historic agreement for $12.5 million with the Ukrainian Canadian community for the acknowledgement, commemoration and, education of Canadians of the dark episode of internment operations against Ukrainian Canadians.

===International self-financed fact-finding missions===
From 7–14 August 2009, Wrzesnewskyj took part in a self-financed fact-finding mission to Jordan, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem along with fellow parliamentarians from the New Democratic Party and Bloc Québécois. The mission&#x27;s goals were to gain firsthand knowledge and understanding and assess the opportunities to build towards a peaceful and just solution between Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. He subsequently co-authored a report which offered several key recommendations to the Government of Canada. He also self-financed a fact-finding mission to Darfur, Sudan, regarding the Darfur Conflict, and another to Somalia.

===RCMP pension scandal===
In April 2007, Wrzesnewskyj publicly called for a full judicial inquiry into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) pension fund scandal and spoke to the media on the matter. He was instrumental in bringing forward to the Public Accounts Committee, and pursuing, an investigation into the misuse of the RCMP pension and insurance funds involving the upper echelons of Canada&#x27;s national police force which pressured the government into establishing the Task Force on Governance and Cultural Change in the RCMP. Here again, Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin emphatically stated that &quot;nothing would not have been done (with the RCMP pension scandal) if it hadn&#x27;t been for Borys.&quot;

===Hezbollah comments===
In August 2006, Wrzesnewskyj said that the Canadian government should engage in talks with militant organizations, including Hezbollah, for the purpose of ending the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. There were some media reports in this period that Wrzesnewskyj called for Hezbollah to be taken off Canada&#x27;s list of terrorist organizations. He responded that this was a misrepresentation of his position, saying, &quot;on the contrary, Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and I stated that it must remain on Canada&#x27;s list because it has committed war crimes by sending rockets into civilian areas.&quot; He added that Canadian law should be amended to permit political and diplomatic contact for the purposes of ending the conflict. As the result of media perceptions about his comments, he resigned his post as foreign affairs critic. He would later be critic for Crown Corporations for most of 2007.

===Special Advisor to the Liberal Leader on Emerging Democracies===
From 2009-11, Wrzesnewskyj held the position of Special Advisor to the Liberal Leader on Emerging Democracies.

As a Canadian parliamentarian of partial Polish heritage, Wrzesnewskyj is the founder of the Canada-Poland Parliamentary Friendship Group. He has persistently criticized Canadian Minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney for reducing immigration quotas from Poland, and Ukraine to Canada. He has also spoken to Canadian media on the Katyn Massacre and 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash that saw the deaths of Poland&#x27;s senior government, diplomatic and military leaders, including President Lech Kaczynski.

In April 2010, with the President of the Canadian Jewish Congress Mark Freiman, Wrzesnewskyj organized a symposium featuring Meylakh Sheykhet, director of the Union of Councils for Jews of the former Soviet Union in Ukraine, on the importance of Ukrainian-Jewish relations in a historical and current geopolitical context.

Again in December 2010, Wrzesnewskyj and Mustafa Jemilev (Dzhemilev) spoke out about the potential for ethnic conflict in Crimea between Russians, Tartars, and Ukrainians.

===2011 election===
In the 2011 election, Wrzesnewskyj was defeated by Conservative candidate Ted Opitz by a margin of just 26 votes. A judicial recount subsequently confirmed Opitz&#x27;s victory.

Nearly a year after the election, allegations of an election dirty tricks campaign linked to the Conservative Harper government persists. At a news conference on 25 February 2012, interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae said that Wrzesnewskyj will be going to court on 2 May 2012 to call for a by-election. Wrzesnewskyj will be alleging that there were irregularities at ten polls in the riding of Etobicoke Centre.

===After the 2011 election===
Despite the narrow loss in the May 2011 election, Wrzesnewskyj has continued dedicating himself to public service. This includes the closure of the immigration case of Arjan Tabaj, championed by Wrzesnewskyj and immigration lawyer Scott McDonald. Tabaj is a partly paralyzed survivor of an assassination attempt during elections in Albania. In September 2011, Tabaj, his wife Anilda, his daughter and twin sons returned to Canada after Jason Kenney had the family deported in 2009. Later, a Canadian federal court ruled that the family was wrongfully deported. Lorne Waldman, a leading immigration lawyer said that stark reversals like the Tabaj case &quot;are rarer than hen&#x27;s teeth&quot;.

After the arrest of Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko in August 2011, Wrzesnewskyj participated in demonstrations at the Ukrainian Consulate in Toronto, calling for the support of democracy in Ukraine and release of all political prisoners. International organizations, representatives of the European Union and the United States called Tymoshenko&#x27;s arrest &quot;selective prosecution of political opponents&quot;.

In August 2011, Wrzesnewskyj led the Ukrainian Canadian community&#x27;s fundraising effort for famine relief in Somalia, i.e. 2011 Horn of Africa famine, with $100,000 committed, mostly from one donor, entrepreneur and Northland Power founder Jim Temerty, &quot;whose family roots go back to one of the regions that was worst affected in the Holodomor&quot;.

In December 2011, Wrzesnewskyj participated in a demonstration outside the Russian consulate in Toronto. He spoke against election fraud in the 2011 Russian parliamentary elections, advocated for democracy in Russia, warned against Putinism, and called for the government of Canada to state that &quot;Canada stands &#x27;shoulder to shoulder&#x27; with the people of Russia, and not with Putin or the Kremlin.&quot;

===Potential Liberal leadership campaign in 2013===
After the Liberal Party suffered their worst defeat in history under Michael Ignatieff in the May 2, 2011 federal election, and the previous defeat of Stéphane Dion in 2008, party loyalists have objected to Liberal Party decision makers who reflexively promote and support high-profile or star leadership candidates. Supporters have quietly urged Wrzesnewskyj to run for the 2013 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election.

===Supreme Court of Canada case===
Wrzesnewskyj challenged the election results of May 2, 2011 in the Etobicoke Centre. Early in 2012, he launched his case in the Ontario Court of Justice, arguing voting irregularities, including ballots cast by people who did not live in the riding, the possibility that at least some people voted multiple times, and mistakes made in the conduct of the election by Elections Canada.

On May 18, Justice Thomas Lederer agreed with Wrzesnewskyj, declaring the election results null and void, and ordered a by-election in Etobicoke Centre.

Despite Justice Lederer&#x27;s decision, Ted Opitz appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and has refused to step down as MP from the House of Commons and run again against Wrzesnewskyj in a by-election. Opitz continues to vote in the House of Commons. Wrzesnewskyj has stated Opitz should sit out votes in the House of Commons: &quot;It undermines ... our confidence in the democratic system that we have if we don&#x27;t know who the actual member of Parliament is.&quot;

On 10 July 2012 the Supreme Court of Canada interrupted its summer break to hear appeals from Ted Opitz and to decide whether a by-election is required. &quot;The Supreme Court will likely make its decision quickly since by law, it has to expedite the case. If the court rules this summer, there could be a by-election in Etobicoke Centre early in the new year, or sooner.&quot;

Instead of accepting the Ontario judge&#x27;s decision and calling a by-election, the governing Conservatives decided to fight it, becoming the first party to take such a matter to the Supreme Court. Judge Lederer&#x27;s May ruling was only the sixth time since 1949 that a Canadian court has set aside federal election results in a riding.

While the Tory party is paying Opitz&#x27;s legal bills, the Liberal Party of Canada refused to pay for Wrzesnewskyj&#x27;s legal costs. Wrzesnewskyj has spent over $300,000 of his own money to bring the case to court.

On Thursday October 25, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in a split decision in favour of Opitz, allowing him to remain as MP for Etobicoke Center and once and for all putting an end to Wrzesnewskyj&#x27;s dispute.

===2015–2019===
In the 2015 election, Wrzesnewskyj defeated Conservative MP Opitz by a margin of over 9,500 votes. During the election, he criticized the lack of investment in public transit by the Harper government. He also noted that Harper&#x27;s time in office saw &quot;increasing international jingoism,&quot; and criticized the Conservatives&#x27; handling of the global refugee crisis. Opitz also faced criticism for spending &quot;more than $70,000 public dollars on self-service advertising flyers since 2011&quot;, including allegedly during an election period.

In late 2018, Wrzesnewskyj announced he would not be running for re-election in the coming 2019 election.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Wrzesnewskyj helped organize Canadian volunteers going to Ukraine to serve in the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine.

==Awards and recognition==

Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko awarded Wrzesnewskyj the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, one of Ukraine&#x27;s highest honours, during a special May 26, 2008 ceremony on Parliament Hill, for distinguished services to the state and people of the Ukrainian nation.

In recognition of his public service in Canada–Poland relations, the Canadian Polish Congress awarded him the Gold Honorary Award on January 23, 2010. For his work with Ukrainian Canadian community, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress awarded him its highest honour, the Shevchenko Medal, on October 27, 2010.

On February 25, 2011 Wrzesnewskyj was awarded the Estonian Canadian Medal of Merit for his outstanding contribution to Canadians of Estonian heritage.

On November 15, 2014, President of Poland Bronisław Komorowski, awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit to Wrzesnewskyj, which advocated, among others, the abolition of visas to Canada for Polish citizens and donated the program of Polish language and literature at the University of Toronto.

<text>The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN; Confederation of National Trade Unions) is the second largest trade union federation in Quebec by membership.

== History ==
It was founded in Hull in 1921 as the &quot;Confédération des travailleurs catholiques du Canada&quot; (Catholic Workers Confederation of Canada). It became the CSN only in 1960 when it became secular. The CSN developed a close relationship with the Quebec Liberal Party and worked together to reform Québec&#x27;s labor law in 1965 to extend collective bargaining to government employees. However, by the late 1960s the CSN had fallen out of favor with the provincial government as it became radicalized and threw its support behind social movements.

In 1971, the three leading Quebec unions, the CSN, the CEQ teachers&#x27; union, and the Québec Federation of Labour (FTQ) voted to form the Common Front, a syndicalist organization demanding a unified minimum wage for their 250,000 members. When negotiations failed between the Common Front and the Liberal government, the unions launched the largest general strike in Canadian history. When the strike&#x27;s leaders were jailed for defying orders to return to work, the strike lost momentum and the Common Front broke apart.

The CSN first formally supported Quebec sovereignty in May 1990. It had, however, been associated with the sovereignty movement long before. In both the 1973 and 1976 provincial elections, the CSN, without formally endorsing the Parti québécois, let it be known that it considered the PQ to be most closely aligned with workers&#x27; interests. During the 1980 Quebec referendum, the CSN supported a yes vote on &quot;sovereignty-association&quot;.

== Structure ==
The CSN is characterized by decentralized administration: local unions are organized into federations by sector of activity and regional councils, and are very independent from the central organization. It is also the most politically active trade union in Quebec.

The Confederation currently has about 300,000 members, distributed evenly between men and women, and between the private and public sectors. Marc Laviolette was replaced as president in 2002 by Claudette Carbonneau. Louis Roy, Roger Valois, and Denise Boucher are the 1st, 2nd and 3rd vice-presidents, respectively. Lise Poulin is the secretary and Pierre Patry is the treasurer.

The Montreal Central Council of the CSN endorsed Québec solidaire for the 2007 Quebec election.

<text>Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) is a Canadian Crown corporation and the largest nuclear science and technology laboratory in Canada. AECL developed the CANDU reactor technology starting in the 1950s, and in October 2011 licensed this technology to Candu Energy.

AECL describes its goal as ensuring that &quot;Canadians and the world receive energy, environmental and economic benefits from nuclear science and technology – with confidence that nuclear safety and security are assured&quot;.

Until October 2011, AECL was also the vendor of CANDU technology, which it had exported worldwide. Throughout the 1960s–2000s AECL marketed and built CANDU facilities in India, South Korea, Argentina, Romania, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is a member of the World Nuclear Association trade group.

In addition, AECL manufactures nuclear medicine radioisotopes for supply to Nordion in Ottawa, Ontario, and is the world&#x27;s largest supplier of molybdenum-99 for diagnostic tests, and cobalt-60 for cancer therapy.

AECL is funded through a combination of federal government appropriations and commercial revenue. In 2009, AECL received million in federal support.

In October 2011 the federal government of Canada sold the commercial CANDU design and marketing business of AECL to Candu Energy for million (including 15 years worth of royalties, the government could get back as much as million). The sale entered the exclusive negotiation stage in February, a month after the other bidder, Bruce Power pulled out). Poor sales and cost overruns (billion in the last five years) were reasons for the divestment though SNC-Lavalin expects to reverse that trend by focusing on new generation reactors. SNC-Lavalin Nuclear Inc, SNC&#x27;s nuclear subsidiary is already part of Team CANDU, a group of five companies that manufacture and refurbish the CANDU reactors. The government will continue to own the Chalk River Laboratories (produces isotopes for medical imaging). The transaction puts 800 jobs at risk while improving job security for 1,200 employees. Due to safety concerns many countries are considering thorium nuclear reactors which AECL&#x27;s CANDU reactors easily convert into (from uranium fuelled). Higher energy yields using thorium as the fuel ( of thorium produces the same amount of energy as tons of uranium) also makes it more attractive. OMERS has also shown interest in the company.

==History==

===1940s===
AECL traces its heritage to the Second World War when a joint Canadian-British nuclear research laboratory, the Montreal Laboratory, was established in Montreal in 1942, under the National Research Council of Canada to develop a design for a nuclear reactor. 
Canadian firms had American contracts from the Manhattan Project; with Eldorado Gold Mines for mining and processing uranium ore and with by Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS) for a heavy water plant at Trail, British Columbia.

In 1944, approval was given by the federal government to begin with construction of the ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor at the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories near Chalk River, Ontario, located on the Ottawa River approximately 190 km northwest of Ottawa. AECL was also involved in the development of associated technology such as the UTEC computer.

On September 5, 1945, the ZEEP reactor first went critical, achieving the first &quot;self-sustained nuclear reaction outside the United States&quot;. ZEEP put Canada at the forefront of nuclear research in the world and was the instigator behind eventual development of the CANDU reactors, ZEEP having operated as a research reactor until the early 1970s.

In 1946 the Montreal research laboratory was closed and research was consolidated at Chalk River Laboratories. On July 22, 1947, the NRX (National Research Experimental) reactor, the most powerful reactor in the world at the time, went critical and was &quot;used successfully for producing radioisotopes, undertaking fuels and materials development work for CANDU reactors, and providing neutrons for physics experiments&quot;.

===1950s===

In 1952 AECL was formed by the government with a mandate to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

On December 12, 1952, one of the world&#x27;s first major reactor accidents occurred in the NRX reactor at AECL&#x27;s Chalk River Laboratories, when a combination of human and mechanical error led to a temporary loss of control over the reactor&#x27;s power level. Undercooling of the fuel channels led to a partial meltdown. This caused a hydrogen-oxygen explosion inside the calandria. Several fuel bundles experienced melting and ruptured, rendering much of the core interior unusable. The reactor building was contaminated, as well as an area of the Chalk River site, and millions of gallons of radioactive water accumulated in the reactor basement. This water was pumped to a waste management area of the Laboratories and monitored. Hundreds of military personnel from Canada and the U.S. (including naval officer and later U.S. President, LT James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Carter) were employed in the cleanup and disposal of the reactor debris.

The NRX was repaired, upgraded, and returned to service 14 months later and operated for another 40 years, finally being shut down in 1992. Throughout the 1950s the NRX was used by many researchers in the pioneering fields of neutron condensed matter physics, including Dr. Bertram Brockhouse, who shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in developing the neutron scattering techniques.

The NRU opened in 1957. On November 3, 1957 the NRU (National Research Universal Reactor) first went critical. This was a natural-uranium fuelled, heavy-water moderated and cooled research reactor (converted to high-enriched-uranium fuel in the 1960s, and finally to low-enriched-uranium fuel in the 1990s). The NRU is a world-renowned research facility, producing about 60% of the world&#x27;s supply of molybdenum-99, the principle isotope used for nuclear medical diagnosis. Canada also pioneered use of cobalt-60 for medical diagnosis in 1951 and currently the NRU reactor produces the medical-use cobalt-60, while selected CANDU reactors produce industrial-use cobalt-60, comprising 85% of the world&#x27;s supply. NRU was primarily a Canadian design, and a significant improvement on NRX. Other than radioisotope production, the NRU provides irradiation services for nuclear materials and fuels testing, as well as producing neutron beams for the National Research Council&#x27;s Canadian Neutron Beam Laboratory.

On May 24, 1958, the NRU suffered a major accident. A damaged uranium fuel rod caught fire and was torn in two as it was being removed from the core, due to inadequate cooling. The fire was extinguished, but not before releasing a sizeable quantity of radioactive combustion products that contaminated the interior of the reactor building and, to a lesser degree, an area of the surrounding laboratory site. Over 600 people were employed in the clean-up.

No immediate injuries resulted from AECL&#x27;s two accidents, but there were over-exposures to radiation. In the case of the NRU cleanup, this resulted in at least one documented case of latent, life-changing injury, as well as allegations that radiation monitoring and protection were inadequate (meaning that additional latent injuries would have gone unrecognized or unacknowledged).

===1960s===

In 1954 AECL partnered with the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario to build Canada&#x27;s first nuclear power plant at Rolphton, Ontario, which is upstream from Chalk River. On June 4, 1962, the NPD (Nuclear Power Demonstration) first reactor went critical to demonstrate the CANDU concept, generating about 20 MWe. In 1963, AECL established the Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment (now Whiteshell Laboratories) in Pinawa, Manitoba, where an organically moderated and cooled reactor was built. Later work on developing a SLOWPOKE reactor, thorium fuel cycle, and a proposal for safe storage of radioactive waste were carried out at this site.

AECL built a larger CANDU prototype (200 MWe) at Douglas Point on Lake Huron, first going critical on November 15, 1966. Douglas Point experienced significant problems with leakage of heavy water, which were eventually solved by much-improved valve design. Other important design refinements worked out at Douglas Point opened the way for upscaling to commercial power CANDU reactors in subsequent years.

===1970s===

In 1971 the first commercial CANDU reactor, Pickering A 1, began commercial operation. By 1973 the other three reactors of the A group at Pickering were online and constituted the most powerful nuclear facility in the world at that time. Each Pickering unit produces about 600 MWe of power.

On May 18, 1974, India detonated a nuclear bomb made from plutonium manufactured by the CIRUS research reactor built by AECL in 1956, which was a commercial version of its NRX research reactor. In addition AECL built two power reactors in India based on the Douglas Point design, and many of India&#x27;s other reactors are domestic variants of this design. The connection between India&#x27;s nuclear weapons program and its CIRUS research reactor led to a severance of nuclear technological cooperation between Canada and India.

In 1977–1978 the Bruce A group went online and began commercial operation. Each Bruce unit produces about 800 MWe of power. In 1978, Whiteshell Labs began research into fuel waste disposal.

===1980s===

Between 1983 and 1986, the Pickering B group went online and also in 1983 the single CANDU reactor at Point Lepreau began operation, as did the Gentilly 2 CANDU reactor. Between 1984 and 1987 the Bruce B group began commercial operation, and also in 1987 the CANDU design was ranked one of Canada&#x27;s top-10 engineering achievements.

Douglas Point was decommissioned in May, 1984.

Between 1985 and 1987, a series of design flaws in AECL&#x27;s Therac-25 medical accelerator caused massive overdoses of radiation on 6 different occasions, resulting in five deaths. In 1987 the machine was found defective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and eventually recalled by AECL despite their multiple denials that the problems existed.

===1990s===

Between 1990 and 1993, the 4 CANDU reactors at Darlington went online and represent the most recent reactor construction in Canada.

In 1991, AECL decided to spin off its medical isotope production business under the name Nordion International Inc. The unit was sold to MDS Health Group and now operates under the name MDS Nordion

In the same year, AECL launched the AECL Nuclear Battery, a low-pressure solid-state atomic battery that was capable of providing electricity and heat for 15 years without refueling. It belongs to the SLOWPOKE (Safe Low-Power Kritical Experiment), reactors&#x27; family, a technology developed in Canada and safely used in Jamaica for decades.

With a contract signed in 1991, AECL, in partnership with MDS Nordion, began construction of the MAPLE dedicated isotope-production facility. Constructed on-site at AECL&#x27;s Chalk River Laboratories this facility would house two reactors and an isotope processing facility. Each reactor was designed to be able to produce at least 100% of the world&#x27;s medical isotopes, meaning that the second reactor would be used as a back-up to ensure an uninterruptible supply. The first reactor was started but experienced malfunctions in its safety rods, and a positive nuclear power feedback coefficient was recorded. After running over the Schedule by more than 8 years and more than doubling the initial budget, 

Unit 1 of the Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant was commissioned on December 2, 1996. Rated at 706 MWe, it currently supplies approximately 10% of Romania&#x27;s electrical needs. Unit Two achieved criticality on 6 May 2007 and was connected to the national grid on 7 August. It began operating at full capacity on 12 September 2007, also producing 706 MW.

In the late 1990s, several reactors were built by AECL in South Korea. Wolsong 2 was commissioned July 1, 1997. Wolsong 3 was commissioned on July 1, 1998. Wolsong 4 was commissioned October 1, 1999. All three reactors were rated at 715MWe Gross Output. They currently have some of the highest lifetime capacity factors of nuclear reactors.

===2000s===

In 2001, AECL began tests at Chalk River Labs to determine the feasibility of using surplus mixed oxide fuel (MOX) from the Russian and U.S. defence programs (which contains plutonium) as a fuel in CANDU reactors.

Currently, AECL is developing the Advanced CANDU Reactor, or &quot;ACR&quot;. This design is meant to improve the commercial CANDU 6 design in terms of capital cost and construction schedule, while maintaining the classic design and safety characteristics of the CANDU concept.

Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 began operation on May 6, 2007. Preparatory work required for the completion of Units 3 and 4 is scheduled to begin by the end of 2007.

Company president Robert Van Adel announced that he would be stepping down from the position of president and retired from the company effective November 11, 2007.

Energy Alberta Corporation announced August 27, 2007, that they had filed application for a license to build a new nuclear plant at Lac Cardinal (30 km west of the town of Peace River. The application would see an initial twin AECL Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) plant go online in 2017, producing 2.2 gigawatt (electric).

Point Lepreau, New Brunswick CANDU 6 plant refurbishment to begin as of April 1, 2008.

In June 2008, the Province of Ontario has announced plans to build two additional commercial reactors for electricity generation at a site next to Ontario Power Generation&#x27;s Darlington Nuclear Generating Station Two companies, AREVA and Westinghouse Electric Company along with AECL submitted proposals to build the reactors. In June 2009 the province announced that only AECL&#x27;s ACR-1000 submission met all the proposal requirements. The Ontario government has since suspended the acquisition process citing the cost and uncertainty surrounding the companies future ownership (discussed below).

Medical isotope production using the 1957-built NRU reactor experienced two forced outages due to safety concerns (December 2007) and a heavy water leak (May 14, 2009). The production from the NRU reactor represented a significant fraction of the worlds medical isotope supply and the disruptions caused a worldwide shortage. Due to maintenance requirements from the aging NRU reactor and the failure of the MAPLE 1 &amp; 2 reactor projects, the long term production of medical isotopes at Chalk River became uncertain. The NRU reactor at Chalk River was shut down in 2018.

===2011 Divestiture CANDU Design Division===
In the summer of 2011 SNC-Lavalin won an international bidding process for the reactor design division of the company. Prior to the acquisition, of SNC Lavalin&#x27;s international power workforce (400 of 4000) were engaged in the production and refurbishment of nuclear reactors. Concerns raised about the deal include a lack of commitment by SNC-Lavalin to keeping the design division intact (its size makes it more capable of providing ongoing safety support). For 2010 and 2009 combined Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd lost million. Following divestiture of the reactor design division, AECL will consist of the current Nuclear Laboratories division, including the Chalk River laboratory (produces isotopes for medical imaging), and will continue to be a Crown Corporation on paper but will privatise the operation of its facilities.

<text>James Thompson Farley (August 6, 1829January 22, 1886) was a United States Senator from California.

==Early life==
He was born in Albemarle County, Virginia, and moved to Missouri at an early age. Drawn by the discovery of gold and hastened by a duel in which he nearly killed a man who had been his rival for a woman&#x27;s affections, Farley moved to California in 1849. He tried mining for gold in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties but had little success. As an alternative to the mining work, he studied law. Farley was admitted to the bar in 1854, commencing his law practice in Amador County.

==Political career==
He was elected to the California State Assembly from Amador County at the age of 25 as a member of the Whig Party. At the time, only five years after California had become a state and in accordance with the original Constitution of California, members of the assembly were chosen annually. Farley ran for re-election in 1855, this time as a member of the Know Nothing Party, which was in the majority of the legislature at the time. He again shifted allegiances to the Democratic Party following the collapse of the Know Nothing Party, remaining with the strong political contingent in the assembly and was elected to be Speaker of the Assembly in 1856.

He moved from the state assembly to the California State Senate where he served for as a Democrat. He served as president pro tempore for one session, from 1871 to 1872. He was a friend and spokesperson for the administration of Governor Haight.

He was for several years the recognized leader of the Democratic Party in California, and in 1873 received the caucus nomination of his party for U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of John S. Hager. However, his nomination was defeated by Governor Newton Booth, an independent anti-monopolist. Fortuitously, Senator Aaron A. Sargent retired three years later and Farley was again nominated, and this time elected to the U.S. Senate from California in 1877. He served there from 1879 until 1885. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1884.

He resumed the practice of law after leaving Washington, D.C., and died in Jackson, California in 1886 after three years of struggling with illness. He is buried in City Cemetery in Jackson.

==Personal life==
Farley was described as having a &quot;fine appearance, warmth and congeniality of feelings.&quot; His law practice in Jackson served as a launching pad for other California politicians such as Judge Henry L. Waldo who became the district attorney of Amador County from 1867 until 1870, as well as Anthony Caminetti, who also became the district attorney of Amador County but later became a United States representative from California from 1891 to 1895.

He was married in 1876 to Flora Forester Phelps of Amador County. They were the parents of a son and a daughter.

<doc id="888878" wikidata="Q7424308" url="?curid=888878" title="Sarmite Bulte">
<text>Sarmite Drosma &quot;Sam&quot; Bulte, (, born September 27, 1953) is a Canadian lawyer, advocate and politician. A member of the Liberal Party, she represented the Toronto riding of Parkdale-High Park in the House of Commons of Canada through three successive parliaments from June 2, 1997 to January 22, 2006. Bulte was the first Canadian of Latvian heritage to take a seat in Parliament.

Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Bulte received an Honours Bachelor of Arts from University College, University of Toronto, Specialist Certificate in English in 1975. In 1978, she received a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Windsor. In 1980 she was called to the Law Society of Upper Canada. In July 2004, she was appointed to the Privy Council.

==Political career==
Bulte was considered as one of the more left-wing members of the Liberal Party of Canada on social issues. She was known in Parliament for her special report of women&#x27;s entrepreneurship. She was also a member of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Task Force on Youth Entrepreneurs as well as the member of the Liberal Caucus Task Force on Financial Institutions and the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. She served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Minister responsible for the Status of Women and the Minister of Industry with special emphasis on Women Entrepreneurs.

Bulte chaired the Ontario caucus, travelled extensively to advocate for Canada&#x27;s seat on the UN Security Council and was frequently called upon to deal directly with foreign parliaments in her capacity as Canadian head of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.

Bulte took the position that downloading music, films, novels and other works of art without permission robbed the creators of their right to profit from their creativity. Her critics argued that protecting those rights should not result in individuals being prosecuted.

During the 2006 federal election, Bulte was criticized by law professor Michael Geist, historian Jack Granatstein and blogger Cory Doctorow among others. The criticism centred on the perception of a conflict of interest relating to her position as &quot;one of the leading people on copyright policy, possibly even the future Canadian heritage minister&quot; and her stance in favour of stricter digital copyright laws in the face of campaign contributions to her riding association from Canadian and American entertainment industries, artists, musicians and others with interests in copyright ownership. All of the contributions were well within the legal limits set by Elections Canada and Bulte stated the total donations by companies, trade unions and individuals with interest in stricter digital domain copyright rules represented approximately 10% of donations to her riding association. Adding to the controversy, in January 2006 a $250-a-plate fund raiser was hosted for her by lobbyists from the film, music and video game industries.

In the January 23, 2006 election, she was defeated by New Democratic Party candidate Peggy Nash.

==After politics==
Since her departure from Federal politics she has remained an active and prominent supporter of the Liberal Party. She appeared as the Liberal voice on a Toronto Talk Show, Goldhawk Live! and was most recently alongside Peter Mansbridge and Don Newman on CBC&#x27;s 2008 election night coverage.

Since leaving politics Bulte worked as a consultant to the Ontario government on women entrepreneurship issues, and has worked in Kosovo for the National Democratic Institute as Senior Legislative Consultant to the Assembly of Kosovo. She helped Kosavar parliamentarians understand how their party caucuses could fulfil their roles as forums for debate and coordination of party strategies, advised the all-party women&#x27;s caucus on how they could become a more active, better organized body within the assembly, and to assist in standardizing legislative oversight and expand oversight of new committees. She sits on the Board of the Actors&#x27; Fund of Canada, Runnymede Healthcare Centre, the St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital Foundation Board, the Artscape Foundation Board, and the Toronto Museum Project.

==Attempted return==
In December 2007, Bulte announced her intention to seek the federal Liberal nomination for the riding of Don Valley West to replace John Godfrey who had earlier announced that he would be resigning his seat in the House of Commons in July in order to accept a position as headmaster of Toronto French School. Constitutional lawyer Deborah Coyne also sought the nomination along with United Church Minister Rob Oliphant, local businessman Mohammad Ijaz, former NDP candidate Ian Cameron, and Jonathan Mousley, a former legislative assistant to former Liberal Cabinet minister David Collenette. The March 2, 2008 nomination meeting was won by Oliphant on the fourth round of voting.

==Family==
She is married with three children, David, Lara and Boris (Alex).

<text>James Duval Phelan (April 20, 1861 – August 7, 1930) was an American politician, civic leader, and banker. He served as nonpartisan Mayor of San Francisco from 1897 to 1902. As mayor he advocated municipally run utilities and tried to protect his constituents from the monopolistic practices of the trusts. He represented California in the United States Senate from 1915 to 1921 as a Democrat. Phelan was a progressive supporter of the policies of Woodrow Wilson and was a leader in the movement to restrict Japanese and Chinese immigration to the United States.

==Early years==
Phelan was born in San Francisco, the son of Irish immigrant and banker, James Phelan and Alice Kelly.

In 1881 Phelan graduated from the Catholic Jesuit college in San Francisco, St. Ignatius College. He had two sisters, Alice Phelan Sullivan and Mary Louis Phelan.

==Career==
Phelan studied law at the University of California, Berkeley and then became a banker. He was elected Mayor of San Francisco and served from 1897 until 1902, in three 2-year terms. He pushed for the reform City Charter of 1898 in San Francisco. He served as the first president of the League of California Cities, which was created in 1898. He was the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 1900, but lost to Republican Thomas R. Bard.

Phelan was elected as a Senator of the United States and served from 1915 to 1921. During this time, Phelan established himself as a leader in what fellow anti-Japanese agitator V. S. McClatchy described as the &quot;holy cause&quot; of Japanese exclusion. He remained active in the anti-Japanese movement after leaving office, securing then-presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s support for restricting Japanese immigration in 1912 and helping to push through California&#x27;s discriminatory alien land law in 1913. Phelan was also an advocate for excluding Chinese from the United States. He promoted the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and wrote an article &quot;Why the Chinese Should Be Excluded&quot;(1901) in the North American Review, to increase support for the extension of these laws. In a debate with Imperial Chinese Consul Ho Yow, Phelan mentioned that the Chinese were an undesirable population because they had strong ties to their native country and were incapable of assimilating to the American society. This debate occurred just nineteen months after the outbreak of plague in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. Phelan mentioned that the Chinese had different mindsets and that after twenty years, they remained unchanged in their values. He concluded that American progress would be stunted if the United States continued to allow Chinese immigrants to remain in the country, and that the Chinese workers were taking work away from white workers because they worked for so much lower wages and an accustomed lower standard of living, allowing their labor to be exploited unfairly, driving down conditions of labor and standards of living generally.

==Water and land rights==
In the 1900s, Phelan bought land and water acreage in various places around the San Francisco Bay Area, and he obtained the rights to the water flow of the Tuolumne River in Hetch Hetchy Valley. Ethan A. Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior under President Theodore Roosevelt, tried to stop Phelan, but Roosevelt decided that the wild area could be used for &quot;the permanent material development of the region.&quot; Phelan&#x27;s plans for the region included publicly funded water and electricity for a geographical entity he called &quot;Greater San Francisco.&quot; With his Bohemian Club fellows, Phelan sought to annex land at the perimeter of San Francisco Bay.

==San Francisco Plague==

In 1900, San Francisco citizens distrusted government for previous waste of taxpayers&#x27; money as well as previous refusal to enhance community resources. Government officials refused to invest in public health because health was seen as a personal concern or even a commodity. For this reason, citizens had a lot of hope in Mayor Phelan, who had previously declared the need for healthier living conditions as well as the need for &quot;health departments to provide salutary environments.&quot;

During his tenure as the Mayor of San Francisco, Phelan and his administration were faced with dealing with the plague of 1900–1904 that infected the city&#x27;s Chinatown community. Prior to the plague outbreak in Chinatown, Phelan was an active advocate for improving public health in San Francisco. On October 25, 1897, Phelan addressed the California health board in San Francisco and stated that government intervention was needed in order to establish healthier living conditions. He argued that public health departments required more funding to help improve living conditions. Furthermore, in 1899, Phelan continued his strong advocacy for public health and the prevention of disease through city measures. Later that year, in a shocking move, he opted instead to support an $18 million bond to create a new hospital, schools, and city parks. In September 1899, Phelan and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors further defunded the cities health department. The San Francisco health department was only allocated $155,960 with two-thirds of that going towards the operation of a municipal hospital. Shortly after, the health board members were released from their duties due to political in-house fighting and excessive patronage. After being sworn in, Phelan&#x27;s new health department board members discovered that the department was broke and that within the first six months of fiscal year 1899-1900 the department had already spent the majority of its budget. Through the defunding and mishandling of the department, Phelan and his administration left the health department and the city ill-prepared for what was looming around the corner.

In June 1900 San Francisco&#x27;s city hall received the news that Joseph J. Kinyoun had instituted a travel ban in hopes of preventing the spread of the plague to the rest of the country. Mayor Phelan confirmed the news by stating that Kinyoun had notified him personally about the travel ban. Phelan went on to blame the federal court ruling that restricted the ability of the local government to deal with the plague. In order to improve sanitary living conditions in Chinatown, Governor Henry Gage proposed to hire inspectors and workers to eradicate the plague. Gage requested for Mayor Phelan and his administration to match the state&#x27;s $25,000 contribution. However, Phelan informed Governor Gage that the city did not have the resources to match the state&#x27;s contribution. After meeting with Governor Gage, Phelan and his Board of Supervisors agreed to contribute $6,000. In the summer of 1901, Mayor Phelan publicly announced that he would not run for another term. &quot;During his final address before leaving office, Phelan praised the health board, claiming that because of its vigilance the city &#x27;was saved from Oriental infection.&#x27;&quot; Phelan concluded by thanking the federal government and their efforts to help the city endure the crisis.

Although the San Francisco Plague in Chinatown was reported in journalism, the material printed was prone to exaggerations, biased information, and focused on making the Chinese population look substandard. Newspapers were heavily averse to the Phelan administration and believed the health officials were corrupt and wasteful. For this reason, publications refused to print public health initiatives to prevent disease outbreaks and instead would focus on the community&#x27;s lack of sanitation. Acts of racism were apparent because publications were heavily inclined to use offensive images and headlines to attract attention of readers.

==Earthquake recovery efforts==
During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake Phelan was a member of the Committee of Fifty, called into existence by Mayor Schmitz to manage the crisis. Afterward, when Dr. Edward Thomas Devine, representing the American Red Cross by appointment of President Roosevelt, was responsible for Relief and Red Cross Funds, ex-Mayor Phelan was allowed to assist Devine, thus keeping the money out of the hands of Schmitz and Abe Ruef.

==U.S. Senate==
As a Democrat, Phelan ran for the U.S. Senate against Republican Joseph R. Knowland and Progressive Francis J. Heney. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1914 and served from March 4, 1915, to March 3, 1921. Although he had toned down his anti-Japanese rhetoric during World War I, when the United States had allied with Japan, in 1919, Phelan once again began to speak out against the &quot;Yellow Peril,&quot; delivering a speech in favor of Japanese exclusion before a special session of the state legislature. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1920, defeated by Republican Samuel M. Shortridge, coming in second with 40% of the vote. 
His re-election campaign relied on racial fears; one of his reelection campaign posters contained the headline &quot;Keep California White.&quot; (This poster is displayed at the Japanese American National Museum). During his time in the Senate, he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Railroads during the 64th Congress and of the U.S. Senate Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands during the 65th Congress.

==Later life==
After his time in the Senate, Phelan returned to banking and collected art. He remained active in the anti-Japanese movement, collaborating with McClatchy and the Japanese Exclusion League of California to successfully ban Japanese immigrants from entering the country with the Immigration Act of 1924. First National Bank of San Francisco merged with Crocker National Bank in 1925. Phelan died at his country estate &quot;Villa Montalvo&quot; in Saratoga in 1930. He is buried in the family mausoleum in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

==Legacy==
* Upon his death, Phelan bequeathed the Villa Montalvo estate for use as a public park. Since 1930, it has been a center for the performing and visual arts called Montalvo Arts Center. Some of his mementos and correspondence are on display in the library at Villa Montalvo.
* Phelan Avenue, the main thoroughfare on the Ocean Campus of the City College of San Francisco, named after him was changed in 2018 to Frida Kahlo Way after a public vote.
* The unincorporated community of Phelan, California was named for him and his brother. 
* The James D. Phelan awards, given to young California writers and artists, were established by a bequest in his will.
* A dormitory at the University of San Francisco used to be called Phelan Hall but was renamed in 2017 after protests by students concerned about Phelan&#x27;s racist views.
* In 1887, James D. Phelan&#x27;s father bought an 11-acre parcel on Point Santa Cruz as a family summer retreat, called Phelan Park. The property stayed in the family until a great-niece, Alice Sullivan Doyle, died in 1932. A year earlier Mrs. Doyle had funded construction of the Mission Santa Cruz chapel replica, and she is buried in an alcove off the chapel. A large portion of Phelan Park was given to the Oblates of St. Joseph, and the rest became Lighthouse Field State Beach in 1978.
* As mayor, he promoted bond issues for new sewer systems, city hospitals, and schools.
* Despite his contributions to San Francisco’s economic and industrial growth, James D. Phelan&#x27;s white nativist ideology has caused controversy. His infamous slogan while running for re-election in the US Senate, “Keep California White”, earned allies as well as enemies and he was defeated.

<doc id="888895" wikidata="Q1661827" url="?curid=888895" title="Sector model">
<text>The sector model, also known as the Hoyt model, is a model of urban land use proposed in 1939 by land economist Homer Hoyt. It is a modification of the concentric zone model of city development. The benefits of the application of this model include the fact it allows for an outward progression of growth. As with all simple models of such complex phenomena, its validity is limited.

==Application ==
This model applies to numerous British cities. Also, if it is turned 90 degrees counter-clockwise it fits the city of Mönchengladbach reasonably accurately. This may be because of the age of the cities when transportation was a key, as a general rule older cities follow the Hoyt model and more recent cities follow the Burgess (concentric zone) model.

==Limitations ==
The theory is based on early twentieth-century rail transport and does not make allowances for private cars that enable commuting from cheaper land outside city boundaries. This occurred in Calgary in the 1930s when many near-slums were established outside the city but close to the termini of the street car lines. These are now incorporated into the city boundary but are pockets of low-cost housing in medium cost areas. The theory also does not take into account the new concepts of edge cities and boomburbs, which began to emerge in the 1980s, after the creation of the model. Since its creation, the traditional Central Business District has diminished in importance as many retail and office buildings have moved into the suburbs.
*Physical features - physical features may restrict or direct growth along certain wedges
*The growth of a sector can be limited by leapfrog land.
*The theory too lacks the idea based on land topography.

<doc id="888900" wikidata="Q2980588" url="?curid=888900" title="Mathematical Bridge">
<text>The Mathematical Bridge is a wooden footbridge in the southwest of central Cambridge, England.
It bridges the River Cam about one hundred feet northwest of Silver Street Bridge and connects two parts of Queens&#x27; College. Its official name is simply the Wooden Bridge or Queens&#x27; Bridge. It is a Grade II listed building.

The bridge was designed by William Etheridge, and built by James Essex in 1749. It has been rebuilt on two occasions, in 1866 and in 1905, but has kept the same overall design. Although it appears to be an arch, it is composed entirely of straight timbers built to an unusually sophisticated engineering design, hence the name.

A replica of the bridge was built in 1923 near the Iffley Lock in Oxford.

The original Mathematical Bridge was another bridge of the same design, also commissioned by James Essex, crossing the Cam between Trinity and Trinity Hall colleges, where Garret Hostel Bridge now stands.

==Mathematical explanation==

The arrangement of timbers is a series of tangents that describe the arc of the bridge, with radial members to tie the tangents together and triangulate the structure, making it rigid and self-supporting. This type of structure, technically tangent and radial trussing, is an efficient structural use of timber, and was also used for the timber supporting arches (centring) used for building stone bridges. Analysis of the design shows that the tangent members are almost entirely under compression, while the radial timbers are almost entirely subject to tension with very little bending stress, or to put it another way, the tangent and radial elements elegantly express the forces involved in arched construction.
== Myths ==
A popular fable is that the bridge was designed and built by Sir Isaac Newton without the use of nuts or bolts. Various stories relate how at some point in the past either students or fellows of the University attempted to take the bridge apart and put it back together, but were unable to work out how to hold the structure together, and were obliged to resort to adding nuts and bolts. In reality, bolts or the equivalent are an inherent part of the design. When it was first built, iron spikes were driven into the joints from the outer side, where they could not be seen from the inside of the parapets, explaining why bolts were thought to be an addition to the original. Newton could not have been directly involved since he died in 1727, twenty-two years before the bridge was constructed.

<text>POSCO (formerly Pohang Iron and Steel Company) is a South Korean steel manufacturer headquartered in Pohang, South Korea. It had an output of of crude steel in 2015, making it the world&#x27;s sixth-largest steelmaker by this measure. In 2010, it was the world&#x27;s largest steel manufacturing company by market value. Also, in 2024, it was named as the world&#x27;s 233rd-largest corporation by the Fortune Global 500.

POSCO currently operates two integrated steel mills in South Korea, in Pohang and Gwangyang. POSCO previously operated a joint venture with U.S. Steel, USS-POSCO Industries, in Pittsburg, California, United States, but U.S. Steel acquired full ownership of the facility in February 2020.

==History==
===1968–1971===
In the 1960s, South Korean administration concluded that self-sufficiency in steel and the construction of an integrated steelworks were essential to economic development. Since South Korea had not possessed a modern steel plant prior to 1968, many foreign and domestic businesses were skeptical of Republic of Korea Government&#x27;s decision to invest so heavily in developing its own industry. The Korean government created Pohang Iron and Steel Company, Ltd (POSCO) in 1968 and appointed as president of the mill a competent retired army general and friend of President Park Chung Hee, Park Tae-joon, a man with a track record of having turned around the government-owned Korea Tungsten Company. Construction of the Pohang plant began on April 1, 1970, and was dedicated on July 3, 1973, with an initial annual capacity of 1.03 million metric tons.

Japan provided the money for the construction of the initial plant, following an agreement made at the Third South Korea-Japan Ministerial Meeting in 1969. Financing included US$119 million in government grants and loans, US$54 million in credit from the Export-Import Bank of Japan, and technical assistance from Nippon Steel and other corporations. This cooperation was one consequence of the normalization of relations with Japan in 1965 and reflected the view of the government of Japan as noted in the Nixon-Sato communique of November 21, 1969, that &quot;the national security of the Republic of Korea is essential to the security of Japan.&quot;

===1972–1992===
POSCO first began to sell plate products in 1972 and focused its sales policies on the domestic market to improve steel self-sufficiency at home. It made special efforts to supply quality iron and steel to related domestic companies at below export price to strengthen their international competitiveness.

Beginning in 1973, South Korea&#x27;s government used its National Investment Fund and the Korea Development Bank to invest large amounts of money into what Park Chung-hee&#x27;s government viewed as the six strategic industries: steel, non-ferrous metals, shipbuilding, industrial machinery, electronics, and petrochemicals. This strategy helped develop companies POSCO and reduced input costs for production in downstream industries as well.

POSCO produced of raw steel in 1980, recording a 13% increase over the previous year, and was one of the few exceptions when almost all areas of the Korean economy were in economic depression. Domestic industries absorbed POSCO&#x27;s major products such as automobile and home appliance manufacturers consuming hot rolled products, shipbuilding and construction and engineering companies consuming medium plates, and electric motor and transformer manufacturers consuming electrical sheets. Some over-produced products were exported to foreign countries but the significant import of sections for construction left Korea as a net importer. Globally, POSCO was already the most efficient steel producer in certain products.

By the late 1980s, POSCO&#x27;s growth had been immense. It was the fifth biggest steel company in the world, with an annual production approaching 12 million tons worth 3 trillion won. POSCO continued to expand productivity and size at a time when the steel industries of the United States and Japan were declining. POSCO completed its second-phase mill at Gwangyang in August 1988. A third-phase mill completed in 1992 further increased crude steel production to a total output of approximately 17.2 million tons a year. In terms of productivity, POSCO was the world&#x27;s best steel manufacturer throughout the late 1980s and also was at the top in terms of facilities.

Pohang, previously a fishing port whose major industry was processing fish and marine products, became a major industrial center with almost 520,000 people. In addition to the huge integrated steel mill, Pohang became an industrial complex housing companies that manufacture finished steel products of raw materials provided.

====Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)====
POSCO CEO Park Tae-joon was quoted as saying, &quot;You can import coal and machines, but you cannot import talent&quot;. Park realized the need for Korea to educate their youth in science and technology to ensure Korea&#x27;s position in the high technology arena. Park founded the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in 1986 as Korea&#x27;s first science and technology research-oriented university with the mission to educate young Koreans who can contribute to national prosperity through the advancement in science and technology. In 2012 and 2013, the Times Higher Education ranked POSTECH 1st in their &quot;100 Under 50 Young Universities&quot; rankings.

===1992–1997===
Changes in managerial systems and organizational structure accelerated in 1993 when POSCO&#x27;s president and founder, Park Tae-Joon, who had wielded absolute managerial authority for more than 25 years, resigned.

With the change in leadership—from Park Tae-Joon to Ryu-Sang Bu, POSCO increased decentralization and diversification. POSCO&#x27;s management emphasized greater flexibility, autonomy, and consensual decision-making processes. The chairman also moved to devolve more autonomy to the profit centers and changing from a strictly hierarchical organizational structure to one based on teams.

In July 1994, POSCO created two subsidiary companies, POSTEEL and POSTRADE. POSTEEL is the domestic sales and service arm of the company, while POSTRADE handles international trading of POSCO products. Both subsidiaries commenced full operation in September 1994, with all international POSCO affiliates transferred to POSTRADE by the end of that year. The landmark Posteel Tower on Tehran Street, in Seoul&#x27;s Gangnam district (not to be confused with the POSCO Center, also on Tehran Street) was completed in 2003.

===1997–2000===
In 1997, Seoul announced that it was going to transform POSCO into a private company in line with the government&#x27;s new policy of privatizing state-owned enterprises. The government planned to retain a majority share of the stock; initial reports in the South Korean press in 1998 indicated that the sale of public shares was going slower than anticipated. However, the administration led by Kim Young Sam changed the initial policy direction of privatization of POSCO and decided not to sell government-owned stock to keep it as a government investment enterprise.

But, the Kim Dae Jung administration following the Kim Young Sam administration listed privatization of public enterprise as a high priority policy in economic policy agenda to implement mainly because of outbreak of the economic crisis. The new administration decided to privatize POSCO and by 1998, the South Korean government had reduced its ownership of shares in POSCO to less than 20%, and more than 58% of the shares in POSCO were in the hands of foreign investors. In 2000, full privatization of POSCO was completed.

===2001–present===
As part of the privatization process, new Chairman Lee Ku-Taek began efforts to introduce a professional management and governance system of global standards for POSCO. Under the new governance system, management made accountability to shareholders a priority. POSCO also introduced a new performance-based evaluation and compensation system. Throughout most of its privatization drive, POSCO increased its revenue and business profit. Thanks to robust demand at home and in China, POSCO recorded the largest profits in the global steel industry in 2004. Net earnings from POSCO&#x27;s array of steel products – used in everything from screws to skyscrapers – shot up 80% to $1.66 billion in 2004 from the previous year.

With increasing global competition, POSCO looked to China and India for new opportunities. South Korean wages were too high to support a whole range of activities and POSCO looked elsewhere for new projects while keeping the areas where they have a comparative advantage in South Korea. By 2006, POSCO had 26 subsidiaries and invested over $2.4 billion in fresh investment on mainland China, especially in galvanized and stainless steel to supply global auto and appliance makers that have opened plants there. In 2006, POSCO started operating the Zhangjiagang Pohang Stainless Steel (ZPSS) steel mill capable of producing 600,000 tons of stainless steel and hot-rolled products annually in China&#x27;s Jiangsu Province. As a result, POSCO became the first foreign firm operating an integrated stainless steel mill in China, handling the entire production process from smelting iron ore to finished products, including the cold rolled stainless plant it already operates. In June 2022, POSCO is temporarily cutting production lines in Pohang plants as thousands of truckers go on a strike for higher pay, causing disrupted cargo transport in the country.

In May 2012, Nippon Steel filed a lawsuit against POSCO, which was established in the 1960s with technical assistance from Nippon Steel, for illegally acquiring the technology for grain-oriented electrical steel sheets developed by Nippon Steel. It was alleged that POSCO hired ex-employees of Nippon Steel to obtain the technology. An ex-POSCO official stated that the company&#x27;s Tokyo research centre was effectively an espionage base, whose primary purpose was to collect information about Japanese steel companies on orders from the Korean head office. The lawsuit was settled in 2015 through an agreement under which POSCO paid 30 billion yen to Nippon Steel.

POSCO has maintained its presence in Russia through its local subsidiary, even as the country faces widespread condemnation and international sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine. Operating through its Russian subsidiary, POSCO remains engaged in the Russian market, a decision that has drawn criticism for undermining global efforts to economically isolate Russia. While numerous companies have withdrawn from the Russian market in response to the ongoing war, POSCO&#x27;s decision to continue operations has sparked significant criticism. Observers argue that its actions contradict global efforts to isolate Russia economically and may be seen as enabling a regime responsible for atrocities and the loss of innocent lives in Ukraine.

====POSCO in India====
In June 2005, POSCO signed a memorandum of understanding with the State of Orissa in India. Under the agreement, POSCO plans to invest US$12 billion to construct a plant with four blast furnaces, an electricity plant, housing, and an annual production capacity of of steel, which is slated to start production in 2010. The project, which would start with a capacity initially, would fetch revenue for the government to the tune of Rs 700 crore to Rs 800 crore (Rs 7-8 billion) annually. It would also provide direct employment to 13,000 people and ensure indirect employment for another 35,000. The Odisha state government also promised to provide a total of 600 million tons of iron sources, and will allow POSCO to use iron ore from these sources over the next 30 years. If the project goes ahead, it will be the single largest foreign direct investment in India as well as being the world&#x27;s biggest greenfield steel plant ever.

However, from 2005 till date (as of August 7, 2010), the India project has not been able to proceed due to strong opposition from the local residents in the area proposed to be given for the steel plant. There have been allegations that the federal and State governments have been illegally trying to take lands and forests for the project, in violation of the Forest Rights Act. There have also been claims that the project will only benefit the company while displacing more people than it employs, damaging the environment and taking India&#x27;s mineral resources at a very low price.

Further, a study undertaken by the Mining Zone Peoples&#x27; Solidarity Group, an international research group focused on India, finds evidence of irregularities in dealings with state, bureaucracy and judiciary and questions and debunks the social, economic and environmental claims that the project has made.

The MoU between POSCO and State of Odisha expired in 2010. Following allegations that the ministry had not adhered to Forest Rights Act, Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) set up the N.C. Saxena committee in July 2010 to review the clearance. Despite the committee&#x27;s report indicating that provisions of the Forest Rights Act had been violated, the MoEF issued final order on January 31, 2011, and gave environment clearance to POSCO. 
In May 2013, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) halted land acquisition for the POSCO projects. In July 2013, POSCO completed land acquisition despite the order given by NGT. In December 2013, POSCO began construction of a boundary wall around its plant site. In December 2013, the NGT criticised the forest clearance granted by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to the proposed steel plant of South Korean steel giant, POSCO, in Odisha.

There have been reports that during protests and land acquisition during Feb - Mar 2013, there has been bombing attack on the resisting villages and naked protest against the police atrocity.

The Central Government of India came out confident on 15 January 2014 that with the renewal of environment clearance, South Korean steel giant POSCO&#x27;s project in Odisha would take off soon.
After a meeting with visiting South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Yoon Sang-jick, Mr. Sharma told the media: &quot;So far, 1,700 acres of land — out of 2,718 acres — have been transferred to POSCO and the rest will soon be given.&quot; On July 17, 2015, news reported that South Korean steelmaker POSCO may halt a $12 billion US dollar plan agreed with Odisha, India a decade ago due to the delay in regulatory approvals. In 2016, POSCO confirms with National Green Tribunal (NGT) that it will suspend the steel plant project in Odisha, India. POSCO finally exited from this project on March 18, 2017 (Saturday).

On 13 January 2022, the Adani Group announced that it had signed an MoU with POSCO to explore the setting up of an Integrated Steel Mill in Mundra, Gujarat, with an estimated total investment of US$5 billion.

====POSCO in other developing countries====

POSCO have pursued investment opportunities in other developing countries such as Vietnam and Mexico. It was announced in August 2006 that POSCO will build a large-scale steel mill in southern Vietnam. POSCO plans to build the US$1 billion plant in two phases for hot-rolled by the end of 2012 and cold rolled products by the time of December 2009. When completed, the mill is expected to produce three-million tons of steel products annually. Posco also plans to build a $250 million plant in the city of Altamira, Mexico, to produce 400,000 tons of galvanized steel sheet a year for automakers. The will be Posco&#x27;s first wholly owned steel-plate plant in North America. Posco began construction in early 2008, and started operations in 2009, producing galvanized and galvannealed steel.

On June 30, 2006, POSCO completed the construction of its sixth continuous galvanizing line (CGL) at its Gwangyang mill in the South Jeolla Province. With this new addition, POSCO becomes the no.2 producer of sheet-steel just behind ArcelorMittal.

In early 2007, Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 4% stake in POSCO. Berkshire sold its share later in 2014.

In February 2013 POSCO signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Afferro Mining, Inc, with a view to developing iron ore resources in Cameroon.

In December 2013, the steel plant Krakatau Posco in Cilegon, Indonesia began operation. Its annual production capability is 3 million tons of steel.

Posco Holdings opened a 25,000-ton lithium hydroxide factory in Güemes, Argentina in October 2024.
==Operations==
===Head Office===

POSCO&#x27;s Headquarters, along with the POSCO Center, form the &#x27;brain&#x27; of the company, overseeing major tasks, such as the management, planning, and finances of the steelworks at Pohang and Gwangyang. The construction of POSCO headquarters at 1 Goedong-dong, Nam-gu, Pohang, was completed on April 1, 1987.

===Pohang and Gwangyang Steelworks===

Pohang - Constructed in four phases between April 1970 and February 1981 along Korea&#x27;s southeast coast, the nation&#x27;s first integrated steelworks has produced 230 million tons of pig iron through March 2004 - enough to build some 250 million compact cars. Crude Steel Production (2008) = 13.6 million tons.
Gwangyang - Constructed in four phases between September 1982 and October 1992 on Korea&#x27;s southern coast, the nation&#x27;s second integrated steelworks. Gwangyang focus on manufacturing automotive steel, high-strength structure steel, API line pipe steel, and other strategic product categories. Crude Steel Production (2008) = 17.4 million tons.

<doc id="888906" wikidata="Q290097" url="?curid=888906" title="Baiae">
<text>Baiae (; ) was an ancient Roman town situated on the northwest shore of the Gulf of Naples and now in the &quot;comune&quot; of Bacoli. It was a fashionable resort for centuries in antiquity, particularly towards the end of the Roman Republic, when it was reckoned as superior to Capri, Pompeii, and Herculaneum by wealthy Romans, who built villas here from 100 BC. Ancient authors attest that many emperors built in Baia, almost in competition with their predecessors, and they and their courts often stayed there. It was notorious for its hedonistic offerings and the attendant rumours of corruption and scandal.

The lower part of the town later became submerged in the sea due to local volcanic, bradyseismic activity which raised or lowered the land. Recent underwater archaeology has revealed many of the fine buildings now protected in the submerged archaeological park.

Many impressive buildings from the upper town can be seen in the &quot;Parco Archeologico delle Terme di Baia&quot;. 

The views and architecture of Baiae were so memorable that they inspired scenes to be depicted on ancient glass flasks made for visitors (probably in Puteoli in the late 3rd to early 4th century AD) many of which have been found scattered throughout the empire, and today kept in many museums notably in Populonia, Empúries and Warsaw. The one in Warsaw in particular seems to give a complete picture of that gradually becoming clear today as a result of research in the submerged archaeological area.

==Name==
Baiae was said to have been named after Baius (, &quot;Baîos&quot;), the helmsman of Odysseus&#x27;s ship in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, who was supposedly buried nearby. Baiae is referred to by Silius Italicus as &quot;sedes Ithacesia Baii&quot; because it was founded by Baius.
The adjacent &quot;&quot; () was named after the town. It now forms the western part of the Gulf of Pozzuoli.

The settlement was also mentioned in 178 BC under the name (&quot;Cumaean Waters&quot;).

==History==


Baiae was built on the Cumaean Peninsula in the Phlegraean Fields, an active volcanic area, on the side of an ancient crater sloping down to the shore. It was perhaps originally developed as the port for Cumae, the Portus Baianus. It also benefitted from thermal springs for bathing establishments.

Around 80 BC it became a fashionable resort for the Roman aristocracy. Marius, Lucullus, and Pompey all frequented it. Julius Caesar had a villa there, and much of the town became imperial property under Augustus. 

From 36 BC, Baiae included Portus Julius, the base of the western fleet of the Roman Navy before it was abandoned because of the silting up of Lake Lucrinus (from which a short channel led to Lake Avernus) for the two harbours at Cape Miseno south.

Baiae was already notorious for the hedonistic lifestyle of its residents and guests in the Republican era. In 56 BC, the prominent socialite Clodia was condemned by the defence at the trial of Marcus Caelius Rufus as living as a harlot in Rome and at the &quot;crowded resort of Baiae&quot;, indulging in beach parties and long drinking sessions. An elegy by Sextus Propertius written in the Augustan Age describes it as a &quot;den of licentiousness and vice&quot;. In the 1st century, &quot;Baiae and Vice&quot; formed one of the moral epistles written by Seneca the Younger; he described it as a &quot;vortex of luxury&quot; and a &quot;harbour of vice&quot; where girls went to play at being girls, old women as girls and some men as girls according to a first century BC wag.

Nero had a notable villa constructed in the middle of the 1st century and Hadrian died at his villa in AD 138. It was also a favourite spot of the emperor Septimius Severus. The resorts sometimes capitalised on their imperial associations: Suetonius mentions in his history that the cloak, brooch, and gold bulla given to the young Tiberius by Pompey&#x27;s daughter Pompeia Magna were still on display around AD 120.

According to Suetonius, in AD 39, Baiae was the location for a stunt by the eccentric emperor Caligula to answer the astrologer Thrasyllus&#x27;s prediction that he had &quot;no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Gulf of Baiae&quot;. Caligula ordered a 3-mile-long pontoon bridge to be built from impounded ships of the area, fastened together and weighted with sand, stretching from Baiae to the neighbouring port of Puteoli. Clad in a gold cloak, he then crossed it upon a horse. Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; also includes the event, with the detail that the emperor ordered resting places and lodging rooms with potable water erected at intervals along the bridge. As late as the 18th century, scattered fragments were still being shown to tourists as the &quot;Bridge of Caligula&quot;. Malloch has argued that Suetonius&#x27;s account was likely coloured by his bias against Caligula; instead, he claims that &quot;the act of bridging the Bay of Naples was an excellent and safe means by which to lay the foundation for [Caligula&#x27;s] military glory.&quot;

It never attained municipal status, being administered throughout by nearby Cumae.

At the end of the 4th century, the fabulously wealthy consul Symmachus, who owned several villas in the Bay of Naples, including one called the &quot;praetorium&quot; in Baiae, wrote of the calm offered by his villa at Bauli (probably Bacoli).

In the early 6th century, the Ostragothic king Athalaric admired the beauty of the area for its bay, the quality of its oysters and baths of natural waters with health restoring powers.

The lowering of the ground close to the coast below sea level, due to bradyseism, seems to have occurred in two phases: between the third and fifth centuries, still in the late Imperial era, followed by a more substantial submersion a century later. The lower part of Baiae was largely submerged by the sea by the 8th century.

Baiae was sacked during the barbarian invasions and again by Muslim raiders in the 8th century. It was deserted owing to recurrent malaria by 1500, but Pedro de Toledo erected a castle, the , in the 16th century.

==The Baianus lacus==

The bay of Baia constitutes the remains of an ancient crater partly submerged in and invaded by the sea. In Roman times it was a complete coastal lagoon, the Baianus lacus, and Roman buildings were located on a sandy expanse between the sea and the eastern bank of the Baianus lacus, now submerged, and occupied the internal slope of the crater.

The channel between the lagoon and the sea made by cutting the sandy isthmus that separated them, and is 32 m wide and delimited by two piers about 230 m long and 9 wide. The piers were made of concrete with tuff chips arranged in layers.
The concrete conglomerate was thrown into wooden caissons (arcae) testified by the presence of the typical holes left by the construction piles. In some cases the posts and the planking of the formwork are still perfectly preserved. The north pier is partly preserved in a 63 m length starting from the east.

==Archaeology==
The statue of the &quot;Aphrodite of Baiae&quot;, a variant of the Venus de Medici, was supposedly excavated sometime before 1803, when the English antiquary Thomas Hope began displaying it in his gallery on Duchess Street in London.

The important archaeological remains were intensively excavated from 1941, revealing layers of buildings, villas and thermal complexes belonging to periods from the late Republican age, the Augustan, Hadrianic to the late Empire.

A cache of plaster casts of Hellenistic sculptures was discovered in the cellar of the Baths of Sosandra at Baiae; they are now displayed at the town&#x27;s archaeological museum. The collection includes parts of several famous sculptures, including Athens&#x27;s &quot;Harmodius and Aristogeiton&quot; and the Athena of Velletri. It suggests that the area had a workshop mass-producing marble or bronze copies of Greek art for the Italian market.

In April 2023 the sunken remains of an ancient Roman villa including marble tiled flooring, numerous marble columns and an ornate mosaic were discovered by underwater archaeologists from the Campi Flegrei Archaeological Park. The mosaic included crossing braids and hexagons with concave sides.

==Monuments==


Among the most significant and remarkable remains are several domed baths buildings such as the great so-called Temple of Mercury, the Temple of Venus, and the Temple of Diana. They were traditionally credited to some of the more famous residents of the town&#x27;s villas, although they were not temples but parts of thermal baths.

The public and private baths of Baiae were filled with warm mineral water directed to their pools from underground hot springs, as many still are today. Roman engineers were also able to construct a complex system of chambers that channelled underground heat into facilities that acted as saunas. In addition to their recreational function, the baths were used in Roman medicine to treat various illnesses and physicians would attend their patients at the springs.

===&quot;Temple of Diana&quot;===

This colossal ogival dome, today half collapsed, originally collected vapours coming from the ground below and was used for thermal baths. It was decorated with marble friezes depicting hunting scenes. It is recognisable as the building erected by Alexander Severus (r. 222–235) in honour of his mother Julia Mamaea, and is perhaps a dynastic heroon.

In 1677 Cornelis de Bruijn visited the temple and wrote:

&quot;Then one arrives at the temple of Diana, which is completely ruined, except for a semi-circular structure at the top that still exists. Opposite, there is also a part of the temple of Apollo, next to which one can see the chamber of the nymphs that delight themselves in different spectacles. At the top of it, I saw many figures and bas-reliefs, very strange and beautiful, as the entrance is still reasonably well preserved.&quot;

===&quot;Temple of Mercury&quot;===

The so-called &quot;Temple of Mercury&quot; contains a large diameter dome, the largest in the world prior to the construction of Rome&#x27;s Pantheon in 128 AD. The dome has a central hole or oculus, four square skylights, was made with large tuff blocks, and is the oldest known surviving dome made of concrete. Built in the 1st century BC during the late Roman Republic, it was used to enclose the frigidarium or cold pool of the public baths. From the eighteenth century descriptions it appeared to have had six niches of which four were semicircular.

===&quot;Temple of Venus&quot;===
This domed building was the most important room of a great baths complex which, together with other buildings on the far side of the coastal road, would have occupied a large part of the town. It was lavishly decorated and was most likely commissioned by Hadrian as indicated by rare architectural features it shared with other monuments of Hadrian especially his Villa at Tivoli. It was externally octagonal with eight large arched windows and internally circular (26 m diameter) with a balcony inside overlooking the pool. Its name is due to a statue of the goddess said to have been found there, leading to mistaken identity.

D&#x27;Ossat noted in 1942 that the dome was umbrella-shaped, indeed it was an even more sophisticated variant, composed of sixteen segments alternately spherical and veloidic. There were no such domes before Hadrian, nor anything that remotely resembled them. Indeed domes with the same design as this building can be found in Hadrian&#x27;s Villa in Tivoli, for example the Vestibule of the Piazza d&#x27;Oro (Golden Square) and the so-called Serapeum. The same combination of light tuff and Vesuvian pumice is found in the Pantheon, Rome, re-structured at the behest of Hadrian.

The drum supporting the dome was covered with stucco imitating bands of marble ashlar blocks with joints filled with blue glass paste, so that the top octagon of the drum must have appeared from the outside as made up of parallelograms of shining white marble divided by glittering ribbons of blue.

The perimeter had a forecourt annex of exceptional architectural innovation, with a groundplan of 9 equal circles within a bounding square of 15 m sides and three circular rooms. The groundplan was merged into a different geometrical arrangement in the upper part of this chamber which was of 8 circles arranged around a large circle, topped with an elegant umbrella-shaped cupola. It was made of only curved surfaces, in total about twenty. The distinctive plan of this annex resembles elements of the pavilion of the ‘Piazza d’Oro” of Hadrian&#x27;s Villa.

The mosaics on the interior of the dome extended down to the window sills, while marble covered the swimming pool and the lower surfaces of the wall.

===Villa of the Ambulatio===
Overlooking the sea is the &quot;Villa of the Ambulatio&quot; with a series of six terraces connected to each other by a complex of staircases of which the last leads to the &quot;sector of Mercury&quot;. It is named after the &quot;ambulatio&quot;, the long corridor with two longitudinal naves on the second terrace, intended to be a covered walk with large openings with a magnificent panorama of the gulf below. Traces of precious stucco can be seen on the brick structure of the central pillars.

On the upper terrace were the residential areas, once richly decorated with several rooms dedicated to leisure. The third terrace is now transformed into a tree-lined garden. The fourth terrace was for service areas. On the fifth terrace are several rooms probably used as places to stay and rest, open to the sea and to the last terrace below that once was occupied by a garden, as today, perhaps surrounded by a colonnade.

===Sector of Sosandra===
Bounded by two parallel staircases is the sector or &quot;Temple of Sosandra&quot; from the name of the statue found in 1953 and now in the National Museum of Naples.

The complexity of this sector on four terraces including a spa, a villa, a &quot;hospitalia&quot; (a sort of hotel for visitors to the nearby spa) is recognisable as the &quot;ebeterion&quot; built by Nero, according to Dio Cassius, for rest and recreation of the sailors of the nearby Misenum fleet.

On the highest terrace are service areas and a small &quot;balneum&quot; with rich stucco decorations on the ceiling. The next level has a large terrace bordered on three sides by a portico. In the garden are four parallel walls that perhaps delimited three triclinia in the open. Above the peristyle are several residential rooms, once richly finished, particularly the original precious mosaic floors representing theatrical masks inside geometric frames. Below this level is a semicircular building surmounted by five vaulted rooms once hidden by a façade decorated with niches and columns, overall making an impressive composition. On the axis of the complex is a room perhaps used as a nymphaeum from which flowed the water that fed an existing large external circular tank. On the peristyle of the lower terrace are paintings from two successive periods: those with an Egyptian taste (characters and symbols of the cult of Isis) from the middle of the 1st century AD; these are largely covered by paintings of the 2nd century, which depict male and female figures within architectural schemes.

===Underwater Archaeological Park===
In the bay, completely submerged by the waters, are the remains of the commercial ports of Baiae (Lacus Baianus) and the Portus Julius. Further west was the port of Cape Misenum, the base of the Roman imperial fleet. Mosaics, traces of frescoes, sculptures, road layouts and columns are also well-preserved about 5 m below sea level.

The protected areas were established in 2002 as a unique example in the Mediterranean of archaeological and natural protection underwater.

====The triclinium-nymphaeum of Claudius====

In 1969 a remarkable and high quality marble sculptural group was discovered about 7 m deep on the seabed in front of Punta Epitaffio. A systematic excavation was later carried out and found a large rectangular room of about 18 x 10 m with a semicircular apse at one end, entirely covered in marble and with a large pool in the centre. This triclinium-nymphaeum (banquet hall) is identified as a room of Claudius&#x27;s villa, a complex arranged in terraces from the top of the promontory extending into the sea up to about 400 m offshore. The room is similar to the triclinium-nymphaeum at Tiberius’s villa at Sperlonga intended for luxurious dining and with similar decoration and statues from the Odyssean cycle.

In each of the side walls were four niches housing a statue, while a water channel ran around the perimeter of the room. A horseshoe-shaped marble bed at the end of the pool is a &quot;stibadium&quot;, a convivial dining couch like the one described by Pliny for his villa; this was placed between the water channel that ran around the walls and the large central basin. Water gushed from some statues placed in the niches on the long sides of the triclinium and from that of &quot;Baios&quot; (Ulysses&#x27; helmsman) in the apse, by means of small lead tubes inserted into the marble.

The decoration was aimed at recreating the atmosphere of a sea cave by the rough natural rocks that covered the apse, the lateral niches and the entrance arch and the water that flowed in the lateral channel and in the central pool. It replicated the episode from the Odyssey in which Ulysses, a prisoner together with his companions in Polyphemus&#x27;s cave, tries to get the Cyclops drunk and then blinds him. The main statuary group was housed in the apse dominating the hall of which the figure of Ulysses survives, represented in the act of offering Polyphemus the cup of wine, and one of his companions carrying the skin. Cyclops probably occupied the central position.

Of the eight statues in the side niches, four were in an excellent state of conservation: two are in keeping with the intended use of the room as a banquet hall, being figures of the young Dionysus with a clear reference to the Odyssey group in the apse. Of the other two, the first portrays Claudius&#x27;s mother, Antonia Minor, as Augusta in the guise of Venus Genitrix, with a diadem on her head and a winged child in her arms, perhaps a funerary Eros; the other is a girl with delicate features, with a hairstyle that recalls the youthful portraits of Nero, also adorned with gems on her head. She is possibly one of Claudius&#x27; daughters who died in infancy.

At the beginning of the 4th century the palace began to be flooded by the sea due to bradyseism and the majority of wall decorations as well as lead pipes were removed.

The sculptures were transferred to the in the Castle of Baia, while copies were placed in their original position in the submerged site.
The museum contains a realistic reconstruction of the nymphaeum.

====Villa Pisoni====

South-east of the Punta Epitaffio are the imposing remains of the villa Pisoni from the end of the 1st century BC which initially belonged to the powerful Calpurnia family from which Calpurnia (wife of Caesar), senators, proconsuls, consuls and popes came. It was owned by Lucius Calpurnius Piso shown by lead pipe stamps. The villa eventually passed to his grandson, Gaius Piso, the leader of the failed anti-Neronian conspiracy of 65 AD. According to Tacitus, the conspiracy envisaged the elimination of the emperor in this very villa which Nero visited frequently. However, the conspiracy was thwarted, Gaius had to commit suicide and the villa was confiscated to become imperial property.

In the first nucleus of the villa exceptional architectonic solutions were adopted on the ancient promontory in front of Punta Epitaffio with an impressive modification of the original landscape, using artificial piers and quays built directly in the sea, using the astonishing advantages of pozzolana volcanic ash of Campania in the setting of pilae and concrete buildings in submerged or partially submerged conditions.

Hadrian had the villa razed to the ground and rebuilt in an even more grandiose form, experimenting with new compositional solutions. The design of the two apsidal corridors along the courtyard is one of the first significant attestations of a new genre of architecture which in its scenographic results, anticipated the Baroque. The villa shows architectural similarities with Villa Adriana in Tivoli. The facade towards Punta Epitaffio resembled the very rich facades of contemporary theatre buildings.

It was built around a large peristyle courtyard garden (&quot;viridarium&quot;) of 95 x 65 m, the entire residential complex occupying an area of 120x160 m. The spectacular northern facade probably opened onto a park that separated the villa from the Palace of Claudius and two thermal baths as well as a vast maritime district with piers, docks, fishponds and pleasant lodging pavilions.

Of particular interest is the vast western basin (80 x 110 m) used as a landing place for large boats and protected to the south from the Sirocco winds by a series of double-row pilae.

====Villa a Protiro====

The villa was next to the entrance channel to the &quot;Baianus lacus&quot; and stretched for about 120 m along the street front lined by a row of shops. It consists of two main parts, thermal baths and a residential section with garden, separated by a rectangular basin linked to the sea and decorated with statues, one of which (of the Aphrodite of the Gardens type) was recently recovered.

The name is derived from a prothyrum entrance or vestibule, a space between the interior fauces of a villa leading to the atrium and the street. In this case it had two stuccoed columns that edged two short parting walls built on the sides of the threshold with doorways to the &quot;ostiarius&quot; quarters (gatekeeper&#x27;s lodge).

The villa has a large variety of architectural types and is especially remarkable for the wide variety of marble flooring and wall coverings in most of the rooms. The atrium walls were clad in marble. To the south of the atrium opens a vast apsidal hall (the apse at the back is 10.4 m wide), probably an addition to the first building and similar to the late imperial halls of the rich &quot;domus&quot; of Ostia Antica which also have rich covering of large marble slabs. The walls of the adjacent rooms were decorated with marble and many had mosaic flooring.

Baiae was supplied with water from a branch of the Aqua Augusta aqueduct, a cross-section of which can be seen nearby.

A mosaic floor, which belongs to a Roman villa, was discovered here in 2024.

==Cultural depictions==

* Seneca the Younger, the Roman Stoic philosopher, makes reference to this city in one of his &quot;Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium&quot;.
* Giovanni Gioviano Pontano (d. 1503) wrote his &quot;Two Books of Hendecasyllables&quot; on the pleasures of Baiae.
* The lost wonders of Baiae were a common feature of Romantic poetry. It appears in John Keats&#x27;s &quot;Ode to May&quot; and in the third stanza of Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot;. The vanished columns of the ancient town inundated by the sea is the central conceit of Konstantin Batyushkov&#x27;s 1819 &quot;You awake, oh Bayya, from the tomb...&quot; (), &quot;one of his last and finest poems&quot;.
* The &quot;princely&quot; seaside resort of the empire appears in J. Meade Falkner&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;The Lost Stradivarius&quot; and Anatole France&#x27;s 1902 &quot;Procurator of Judea&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In current fiction, it is the setting of Caroline Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Sirens of Surrentum&quot;; John Maddox Roberts&#x27;s &quot;Under the Shadow of Vesuvius&quot;; Steven Saylor&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Arms of Nemesis&quot;, set during the Spartacus Rebellion; and Marguerite Yourcenar&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of Hadrian&quot;.
* In the &quot;Ecce Romani&quot; series of Latin textbooks, Baiae is the location of the character Gaius Cornelius Calvus&#x27;s summer villa.
* Baiae was featured in the PBS show &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; in the March 2017 episode &quot;Nero&#x27;s Sunken City&quot;.
* Baiae was featured on Channel 4 programme &quot;Rome&#x27;s Sunken Secrets&quot;, which aired on in the UK on 16 April 2017.
* A forgotten Baiae tunnel complex features prominently in the UK series called &quot;Forbidden History&quot;, whereby the presenter visits a supposed grotto of the Cumaean Sibyl.

<text>The multiple nuclei model is an economical model created by Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman in the 1945 article &quot;The Nature of Cities&quot;.

==The Model==
The model describes the layout of a city, based on Chicago. It says that even though a city may have begun with a central business district, or CBD, other smaller CBDs develop on the outskirts of the city near the more valuable housing areas to allow shorter commutes from the outskirts of the city. This creates nodes or nuclei in other parts of the city besides the CBD thus the name multiple nuclei model. Their aim was to produce a more realistic, if more complicated, model. Their main goals in this were to:
# Move away from the concentric zone model
# Better reflect the complex nature of urban areas, especially those of larger size

The model assumes that:
#Land is not flat in all areas
#There is even Distribution of Resources
#There is even Distribution of people in Residential areas
#There is even Transportation Costs

==Reasons for the model==

Harris and Ullman argued that cities do not grow around a single nucleus, but rather several separate nuclei. Each nucleus acts like a growth point.

The theory was formed based on the idea that people have greater movement due to increased car ownership. This increase of movement allows for the specialization of regional centers (e.g. heavy industry, business parks, retail areas). The model is suitable for large, expanding cities. The number of nuclei around which the city expands depends upon situational as well as historical factors. Multiple nuclei develop because:
# Certain industrial activities require transportation facilities e.g. ports, railway stations, etc. to lower transportation costs.
# Various combinations of activities tend to be kept apart e.g. residential areas and airports, factories and parks, etc.
# Other activities are found together for their mutual advantage e.g. universities, bookstores and coffee shops, etc.
# Some facilities need to be set in specific areas in a city - for example, the CBD requires convenient traffic systems, and many factories need an abundant source of resources.

==Effects of multiple nuclei on Industry==
As the multiple nuclei develop, transportation hubs such as airports are constructed which allow industries to be established with reduced transportation costs.
These transportation hubs have negative externality such as noise pollution and lower land values, making land around the hub cheaper. Hotels are also constructed near airports because people who travel tend to want to stay near the source of travel. Housing develops in wedges and gets more expensive the farther it is from the CBD.
