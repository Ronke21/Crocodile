<text>Henry George Percy, 7th Duke of Northumberland, (29 May 1846 – 14 May 1918), styled Lord Warkworth between 1865 and 1867 and Earl Percy between 1867 and 1899, was a British Conservative politician. He served as Treasurer of the Household under Benjamin Disraeli between 1874 and 1875 and was Chairman of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations from 1879 to 1883.

==Background==
Percy was the eldest son of Algernon Percy, 6th Duke of Northumberland, by his wife Louisa, daughter of Henry Drummond. Lord Algernon Percy was his younger brother. He became known by the courtesy title Lord Lovaine when his grandfather succeeded in the dukedom of Northumberland in 1865 and as Earl Percy when his father succeeded in the dukedom in 1867.

==Political career==
Percy was returned to parliament for Northumberland North in 1868. In 1874 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Treasurer of the Household under Benjamin Disraeli, a post he held until 1875. From 1879 to 1883 he was Chairman of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations. The Northumberland North seat was abolished in 1885 and Percy was not elected for another constituency. Two years later he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s barony of Lovaine.

From 1909 he was made an alderman on Middlesex County Council.

==Civic and military appointments==
Percy succeeded in the dukedom in 1899 upon his father&#x27;s death and was made a Knight of the Garter the same year. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland from 1904 until his death in 1918 and was Lord High Steward at King George V&#x27;s coronation in 1911, where he bore St Edward&#x27;s Crown. He was President of the Board of Governors of Durham University College of Science (in Newcastle) in 1902, and from 1913 he also served as the second Chancellor of the University of Durham.

He was president of the Guildford Agricultural Association from 1902.

He was honorary colonel of the 2nd Northumberland (Percy) Artillery Volunteers until it was disbanded in October 1902.

==Family==
Northumberland married Lady Edith Campbell, daughter of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, on 23 December 1868. They had 13 children:

*Lady Louisa Elizabeth Percy (7 November 1869 – 29 November 1893), unmarried.

<text>Almost Happy is the fourth studio album by Belgian rock band K&#x27;s Choice.

==Music==
&quot;Almost Happy&quot; was recorded at Real World Studio&#x27;s, Box, Wiltshire (UK) and published in 2000. Singles were &quot;Almost Happy&quot;, &quot;Busy&quot; and &quot;Another Year&quot;. The lyrics of this album are more autobiographical than of the previous album (&quot;Cocoon Crash&quot;). The music is, when compared to earlier work, more melancholy and intimate. The American (2002) version included an additional live CD and was published with another cover, featuring a drawing by band member Gert Bettens, who had also drawn the album covers for the two previous albums.

<doc id="873111" wikidata="Q1828897" url="?curid=873111" title="Wars (series)">
<text>The Wars series, also known as and is a series of military-themed turn-based strategy video games, predominantly developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. The series debuted in Japan in August of 1988 with the original &quot;Famicom Wars&quot;, followed by sequels on the Super Famicom and Game Boy. These early installments were released in Japan, with &quot;Advance Wars&quot; (2001) being the first to reach the North American and European markets. &quot;Advance Wars&quot; was released in the United States on September 10, 2001, but put on hold in Japan and Europe due to the September 11 attacks. Although released in Europe in January 2002, neither Game Boy Advance game was released in Japan until the &quot;Game Boy Wars Advance 1+2&quot; compilation, which released for the Game Boy Advance on November 25, 2004. The success of &quot;Advance Wars&quot; in the West is frequently credited as a driving force for Nintendo bringing Intelligent Systems&#x27; franchise &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; outside of Japan, as both series share a similar tactical gameplay style.

In 2005, &quot;Advance Wars: Dual Strike&quot; was released on the Nintendo DS family of systems, which followed and expanded on the basic format of its predecessors. That same year &quot;Battalion Wars&quot;, developed by Kuju Entertainment, was released for the GameCube in Japan under the title &quot;Totsugeki!! Famicom Wars&quot;, where it is considered a spin-off from the main series. &quot;Battalion Wars&quot; is a 3D action real-time strategy game, as opposed to the turn-based strategy of the main series. An expanded sequel for the Wii, &quot;Battalion Wars 2&quot; was released two years later. The last major title in the franchise, &quot;Advance Wars: Days of Ruin&quot;, was released internationally for the DS in 2008 and departed from the series&#x27; light hearted tone. Like the two Game Boy Advance titles preceding it, the game was canceled in Japan following a series of delays until it finally released as a downloadable game in 2013. At E3 2021, over a decade after the release of &quot;Days of Ruin&quot;, a collection of remakes of both &quot;Advance Wars&quot; games, titled &quot;Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp&quot;, was announced for the Nintendo Switch, with a planned release date of December 2021. A release date of April 8, 2022 was later announced, however on March 9, 2022 it was announced that due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine the game was being delayed until further notice. Another release date of April 21, 2023 would be announced a year later. These remakes were developed in collaboration with WayForward Technologies.

==Gameplay==
The player takes the role of a Commanding Officer (CO) in an army, usually of a country called Red Star (changed to Orange Star following international releases). In &quot;Days of Ruin&quot;, it is replaced by a nation called Rubinelle (Laurentia in the European release). In the single-player campaign of the &quot;Advance Wars&quot; games, each level consists of a new map and opposing CO to defeat. Victory is achieved when all the opponent&#x27;s units have been destroyed, their HQ is captured, or another victory condition has been met. COs take turns recruiting and commanding units on grid-based maps. Units available include infantry, tanks, artillery, bombers, and many other military units. Each turn, each unit may move around and/or perform an action, such as attacking or capturing a property. Certain actions, such as capturing, diving, or loading may only be performed at certain instances throughout the game.

The original &quot;Famicom Wars&quot; game consists of two armies, Red Star (which became Orange Star in later international versions, possibly to avoid associations with Communism) and Blue Moon fighting over square grid-based maps. The two armies could either be controlled by human players, or a human player could play against an AI opponent. The original &quot;Game Boy Wars&quot; games featured a system similar to &quot;Famicom Wars&quot;, except the grid was changed so that the grid squares acted more like hexagons; each square is adjacent to six other squares, instead of four. &quot;Game Boy Wars&quot; also features a different opposing army called White Moon. Otherwise, the rules remain identical, and only in &quot;Game Boy Wars 3&quot; were unit levels and a new resource introduced. &quot;Super Famicom Wars&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Famicom Wars&quot;, introduced Yellow Comet and Green Earth, bringing the number of armies playable at once to four. It returned to the basic square grid-based map style of the original game.

The &quot;Advance Wars&quot; games introduced several new elements. The most notable is that COs now have special abilities called CO Powers that can affect the battle in different ways, giving the CO a temporary advantage over the other COs, such as providing allied units with increased firepower or causing damage to opposing units. &quot;Black Hole Rising&quot; introduced Super CO Powers, and &quot;Dual Strike&quot; introduced Tag CO Powers. Conditions such as fog of war, rain, and snow affect the abilities of units to reveal the map and move around. &quot;Days of Ruin&quot; removed many of the features added to previous &quot;Advance Wars&quot; games, greatly weakening CO Powers and reintroducing a unit level system.

===Multiplayer===
Multiplayer mode is an important part of the &quot;Nintendo Wars&quot; series. This allows players to compete against friends, each choosing a Commanding Officer to play and country to represent. The &quot;Advance Wars&quot; series of games, along with the far lesser known &quot;Game Boy Wars 3&quot;, include map editors, giving them increased replayability. In the original &quot;Famicom Wars&quot;, two players were allowed to play; in &quot;Game Boy Wars&quot;, players could play hotseat multiplayer games. Currently the only release to lack hotseat multiplayer is &quot;Game Boy Wars Turbo&quot;. The &quot;Advance Wars&quot; series on the Game Boy Advance allowed link-play using link cables. Online multiplayer was originally planned for &quot;Dual Strike&quot;, but was only later implemented in &quot;Days of Ruin&quot;.
&quot;Battalion Wars 2&quot; introduced online multiplayer over the Wii&#x27;s Wi-Fi connection. The game had 3 modes and 16 maps to play on. The multiplayer section was well-received but was criticized for not supporting voice chat.

<text>In mathematics, the Borromean rings are three simple closed curves in three-dimensional space that are topologically linked and cannot be separated from each other, but that break apart into two unknotted and unlinked loops when any one of the three is cut or removed. Most commonly, these rings are drawn as three circles in the plane, in the pattern of a Venn diagram, alternatingly crossing over and under each other at the points where they cross. Other triples of curves are said to form the Borromean rings as long as they are topologically equivalent to the curves depicted in this drawing.

The Borromean rings are named after the Italian House of Borromeo, who used the circular form of these rings as an element of their coat of arms, but designs based on the Borromean rings have been used in many cultures, including by the Norsemen and in Japan. They have been used in Christian symbolism as a sign of the Trinity, and in modern commerce as the logo of Ballantine beer, giving them the alternative name Ballantine rings. Physical instances of the Borromean rings have been made from linked DNA or other molecules, and they have analogues in the Efimov state and Borromean nuclei, both of which have three components bound to each other although no two of them are bound.

Geometrically, the Borromean rings may be realized by linked ellipses, or (using the vertices of a regular icosahedron) by linked golden rectangles. It is impossible to realize them using circles in three-dimensional space, but it has been conjectured that they may be realized by copies of any non-circular simple closed curve in space. In knot theory, the Borromean rings can be proved to be linked by counting their Fox -colorings. As links, they are Brunnian, alternating, algebraic, and hyperbolic. In arithmetic topology, certain triples of prime numbers have analogous linking properties to the Borromean rings.

== Definition and notation ==
It is common in mathematics publications that define the Borromean rings to do so as a link diagram, a drawing of curves in the plane with crossings marked to indicate which curve or part of a curve passes above or below at each crossing. Such a drawing can be transformed into a system of curves in three-dimensional space by embedding the plane into space and deforming the curves drawn on it above or below the embedded plane at each crossing, as indicated in the diagram. The commonly-used diagram for the Borromean rings consists of three equal circles centered at the points of an equilateral triangle, close enough together that their interiors have a common intersection (such as in a Venn diagram or the three circles used to define the Reuleaux triangle). Its crossings alternate between above and below when considered in consecutive order around each circle; another equivalent way to describe the over-under relation between the three circles is that each circle passes over a second circle at both of their crossings, and under the third circle at both of their crossings. Two links are said to be equivalent if there is a continuous deformation of space (an ambient isotopy) taking one to another, and the Borromean rings may refer to any link that is equivalent in this sense to the standard diagram for this link.

In &quot;The Knot Atlas&quot;, the Borromean rings are denoted with the code &quot;L6a4&quot;; the notation means that this is a link with six crossings and an alternating diagram, the fourth of five alternating 6-crossing links identified by Morwen Thistlethwaite in a list of all prime links with up to 13 crossings. In the tables of knots and links in Dale Rolfsen&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;Knots and Links&quot;, extending earlier listings in the 1920s by Alexander and Briggs, the Borromean rings were given the Alexander–Briggs notation &quot;6&quot;, meaning that this is the second of three 6-crossing 3-component links to be listed. The Conway notation for the Borromean rings, &quot;.1&quot;, is an abbreviated description of the standard link diagram for this link.

== History and symbolism ==
The name &quot;Borromean rings&quot; comes from the use of these rings, in the form of three linked circles, in the coat of arms of the aristocratic Borromeo family in Northern Italy. The link itself is much older and has appeared in the form of the , three linked equilateral triangles with parallel sides, on Norse image stones dating back to the 7th century. The Ōmiwa Shrine in Japan is also decorated with a motif of the Borromean rings, in their conventional circular form. A stone pillar in the 6th-century Marundeeswarar Temple in India shows three equilateral triangles rotated from each other to form a regular enneagram; like the Borromean rings these three triangles are linked and not pairwise linked, but this crossing pattern describes a different link than the Borromean rings.

The Borromean rings have been used in different contexts to indicate strength in unity. In particular, some have used the design to symbolize the Trinity. A 13th-century French manuscript depicting the Borromean rings labeled as unity in trinity was lost in a fire in the 1940s, but reproduced in an 1843 book by Adolphe Napoléon Didron. Didron and others have speculated that the description of the Trinity as three equal circles in canto 33 of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot; was inspired by similar images, although Dante does not detail the geometric arrangement of these circles. The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan found inspiration in the Borromean rings as a model for his topology of human subjectivity, with each ring representing a fundamental Lacanian component of reality (the &quot;real&quot;, the &quot;imaginary&quot;, and the &quot;symbolic&quot;).

The rings were used as the logo of Ballantine beer, and are still used by the Ballantine brand beer, now distributed by the current brand owner, the Pabst Brewing Company. For this reason they have sometimes been called the &quot;Ballantine rings&quot;.

The first work of knot theory to include the Borromean rings was a catalog of knots and links compiled in 1876 by Peter Tait. In recreational mathematics, the Borromean rings were popularized by Martin Gardner, who featured Seifert surfaces for the Borromean rings in his September 1961 &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. In 2006, the International Mathematical Union decided at the 25th International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, Spain to use a new logo based on the Borromean rings.

=== Partial and multiple rings ===
In medieval and renaissance Europe, a number of visual signs consist of three elements interlaced together in the same way that the Borromean rings are shown interlaced (in their conventional two-dimensional depiction), but with individual elements that are not closed loops. Examples of such symbols are the Snoldelev stone horns and the Diana of Poitiers crescents.

Some knot-theoretic links contain multiple Borromean rings configurations; one five-loop link of this type is used as a symbol in Discordianism, based on a depiction in the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;.

== Mathematical properties ==
=== Linkedness ===

In knot theory, the Borromean rings are a simple example of a Brunnian link, a link that cannot be separated but that falls apart into separate unknotted loops as soon as any one of its components is removed. There are infinitely many Brunnian links, and infinitely many three-curve Brunnian links, of which the Borromean rings are the simplest.

There are a number of ways of seeing that the Borromean rings are linked. One is to use Fox -colorings, colorings of the arcs of a link diagram with the integers modulo so that at each crossing, the two colors at the undercrossing have the same average (modulo ) as the color of the overcrossing arc, and so that at least two colors are used. The number of colorings meeting these conditions is a knot invariant, independent of the diagram chosen for the link. A trivial link with three components has formula_1 colorings, obtained from its standard diagram by choosing a color independently for each component and discarding the formula_2 colorings that only use one color. For standard diagram of the Borromean rings, on the other hand, the same pairs of arcs meet at two undercrossings, forcing the arcs that cross over them to have the same color as each other, from which it follows that the only colorings that meet the crossing conditions violate the condition of using more than one color. Because the trivial link has many valid colorings and the Borromean rings have none, they cannot be equivalent.

The Borromean rings are an alternating link, as their conventional link diagram has crossings that alternate between passing over and under each curve, in order along the curve. They are also an algebraic link, a link that can be decomposed by Conway spheres into 2-tangles. They are the simplest alternating algebraic link which does not have a diagram that is simultaneously alternating and algebraic. It follows from the Tait conjectures that the crossing number of the Borromean rings (the fewest crossings in any of their link diagrams) is 6, the number of crossings in their alternating diagram.

=== Ring shape ===
The Borromean rings are typically drawn with their rings projecting to circles in the plane of the drawing, but three-dimensional circular Borromean rings are an impossible object: it is not possible to form the Borromean rings from circles in three-dimensional space. More generally proved using four-dimensional hyperbolic geometry that no Brunnian link can be exactly circular. For three rings in their conventional Borromean arrangement, this can be seen from considering the link diagram. If one assumes that two of the circles touch at their two crossing points, then they lie in either a plane or a sphere. In either case, the third circle must pass through this plane or sphere four times, without lying in it, which is impossible. Another argument for the impossibility of circular realizations, by Helge Tverberg, uses inversive geometry to transform any three circles so that one of them becomes a line, making it easier to argue that the other two circles do not link with it to form the Borromean rings.

However, the Borromean rings can be realized using ellipses. These may be taken to be of arbitrarily small eccentricity: no matter how close to being circular their shape may be, as long as they are not perfectly circular, they can form Borromean links if suitably positioned. A realization of the Borromean rings by three mutually perpendicular golden rectangles can be found within a regular icosahedron by connecting three opposite pairs of its edges. Every three unknotted polygons in Euclidean space may be combined, after a suitable scaling transformation, to form the Borromean rings. If all three polygons are planar, then scaling is not needed. In particular, because the Borromean rings can be realized by three triangles, the minimum number of sides possible for each of its loops, the stick number of the Borromean rings is nine.
More generally, Matthew Cook has conjectured that any three unknotted simple closed curves in space, not all circles, can be combined without scaling to form the Borromean rings. After Jason Cantarella suggested a possible counterexample, Hugh Nelson Howards weakened the conjecture to apply to any three planar curves that are not all circles. On the other hand, although there are infinitely many Brunnian links with three links, the Borromean rings are the only one that can be formed from three convex curves.

=== Ropelength ===

In knot theory, the ropelength of a knot or link is the shortest length of flexible rope (of radius one) that can realize it. Mathematically, such a realization can be described by a smooth curve whose radius-one tubular neighborhood avoids self-intersections. The minimum ropelength of the Borromean rings has not been proven, but the smallest value that has been attained is realized by three copies of a 2-lobed planar curve. Although it resembles an earlier candidate for minimum ropelength, constructed from four circular arcs of radius two, it is slightly modified from that shape, and is composed from 42 smooth pieces defined by elliptic integrals, making it shorter by a fraction of a percent than the piecewise-circular realization. It is this realization, conjectured to minimize ropelength, that was used for the International Mathematical Union logo. Its length is formula_3, while the best proven lower bound on the length is formula_4.

For a discrete analogue of ropelength, the shortest representation using only edges of the integer lattice, the minimum length for the Borromean rings is exactly formula_5. This is the length of a representation using three formula_6 integer rectangles, inscribed in Jessen&#x27;s icosahedron in the same way that the representation by golden rectangles is inscribed in the regular icosahedron.

=== Hyperbolic geometry ===

The Borromean rings are a hyperbolic link: the space surrounding the Borromean rings (their link complement) admits a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume. Although hyperbolic links are now considered plentiful, the Borromean rings were one of the earliest examples to be proved hyperbolic, in the 1970s, and this link complement was a central example in the video &quot;Not Knot&quot;, produced in 1991 by the Geometry Center.

Hyperbolic manifolds can be decomposed in a canonical way into gluings of hyperbolic polyhedra (the Epstein–Penner decomposition) and for the Borromean complement this decomposition consists of two ideal regular octahedra. The volume of the Borromean complement is formula_7 where formula_8 is the Lobachevsky function and formula_9 is Catalan&#x27;s constant. The complement of the Borromean rings is universal, in the sense that every closed 3-manifold is a branched cover over this space.

=== Number theory ===
In arithmetic topology, there is an analogy between knots and prime numbers in which one considers links between primes. The triple of primes are linked modulo 2 (the Rédei symbol is −1) but are pairwise unlinked modulo 2 (the Legendre symbols are all 1). Therefore, these primes have been called a &quot;proper Borromean triple modulo 2&quot; or &quot;mod 2 Borromean primes&quot;.

== Physical realizations ==

A monkey&#x27;s fist knot is essentially a 3-dimensional representation of the Borromean rings, albeit with three layers, in most cases. Sculptor John Robinson has made artworks with three equilateral triangles made out of sheet metal, linked to form Borromean rings and resembling a three-dimensional version of the valknut. A common design for a folding wooden tripod consists of three pieces carved from a single piece of wood, with each piece consisting of two lengths of wood, the legs and upper sides of the tripod, connected by two segments of wood that surround an elongated central hole in the piece. Another of the three pieces passes through each of these holes, linking the three pieces together in the Borromean rings pattern. Tripods of this form have been described as coming from Indian or African hand crafts.

In chemistry, molecular Borromean rings are the molecular counterparts of Borromean rings, which are mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures. In 1997, biologist Chengde Mao and coworkers of New York University succeeded in constructing a set of rings from DNA. In 2003, chemist Fraser Stoddart and coworkers at UCLA utilised coordination chemistry to construct a set of rings in one step from 18 components. Borromean ring structures have been used to describe noble metal clusters shielded by a surface layer of thiolate ligands. A library of Borromean networks has been synthesized by design by Giuseppe Resnati and coworkers via halogen bond driven self-assembly. In order to access the molecular Borromean ring consisting of three unequal cycles a step-by-step synthesis was proposed by Jay S. Siegel and coworkers.

In physics, a quantum-mechanical analog of Borromean rings is called a halo state or an Efimov state, and consists of three bound particles that are not pairwise bound. The existence of such states was predicted by physicist Vitaly Efimov in 1970, and confirmed by multiple experiments beginning in 2006. This phenomenon is closely related to a Borromean nucleus, a stable atomic nucleus consisting of three groups of particles that would be unstable in pairs. Another analog of the Borromean rings in quantum information theory involves the entanglement of three qubits in the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state.

<doc id="873119" wikidata="Q1346817" url="?curid=873119" title="Daigo, Ibaraki">
<text>is a town located in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 15,771 in 6431 households and a population density of . The percentage of the population aged over 65 was 46.6%. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Located in northwestern Ibaraki Prefecture along the upper reaches of the Kuji River, Daigo is bordered to the north by Fukushima Prefecture and to the west by Tochigi Prefecture.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Fukushima Prefecture
* Tanagura
* Yamatsuri
Ibaraki Prefecture
* Hitachiōmiya
* Hitachiōta
Tochigi Prefecture
*Nakagawa
*Ōtawara

===Climate===
Although the altitude is relatively low at 120 meters, Daigo is very chilly in the morning and evening in winter because it is located in a basin. The average minimum temperature of minus 5.5 °C in January is almost the same as Morioka, Iwate, much further north, and Daigo is known for having some of the coldest winters in the Kantō region. However, during the daytime, the temperature rises to nearly 10 °C due to solar radiation. In addition, summers often record hot days.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Daigo has decreased drastically and is now less than half of what it was 60 years ago.

==History==
Daigo village was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was elevated to town status on July 20, 1891. On March 31, 1955, the villages of Yorigami, Fukuroda, Miyagawa, Kurosawa, Namase, Kamiogawa, Shimoogawa and Murotono merged with Daigo.

==Government==
Daigo has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 13 members. Daigo, together with neighbouring Hitachiōta, contributes two members to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Ibaraki 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Daigo is noted for many onsens (hot springs) and agricultural products of many kinds. 

Besides that Daigo is well known for its tea production. It is one of the northernmost places in Japan where tea grows. The area&#x27;s fertile soil, clean air, and mild climate provide ideal growing conditions for tea plants. Tea production has been a vital part of Daigo&#x27;s economy and culture for centuries, with many small family-run tea farms still operating in the region.

==Education==
Daigo has six public elementary schools and four public middle schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Ibaraki Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<doc id="873124" wikidata="Q274154" url="?curid=873124" title="Sam Bettens">
<text>Sam Bettens (formerly Sarah Bettens, born September 23, 1972) is a Belgian singer and musician, best known as the lead singer of the Belgian band, K&#x27;s Choice.

In May 2019, he came out as a transgender man.

==Career==
===K&#x27;s Choice===

In the mid-1990s, Bettens formed the band K&#x27;s Choice with his brother Gert. They are the two best-known faces of the band. The band is popular in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, and has toured in the U.S. with The Verve Pipe, Tonic, Alanis Morissette and the Indigo Girls, as well as on its own.

===Solo===

Bettens&#x27; first solo effort was the five-track EP, &quot;Go&quot;, released 31 May 2004. Four of the five songs from &quot;Go&quot; were included on his first full-length solo album, &quot;Scream&quot;, released in Europe on 14 March 2005, and in the USA on 23 August 2005.

In March 2007, Bettens released a three-track digital-only EP exclusively through online music label Fuzz (music company). His second full-length album, &quot;Shine&quot;, including new mixes of the tracks from the Fuzz EP, was released in 2007. It was produced by Brad Wood. The full CD was distributed for free with 13 October edition of the Flemish newspaper De Morgen in Belgium, which sold 180,000 copies. (Normally the paper sells 95,000 copies.)

In 2007, Bettens won an EBBA Award, awarded annually to ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.

In late 2008, Bettens released the album &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;, consisting of recordings of live performances of K&#x27;s Choice and solo songs, covers, and new songs which had been played during previous tours. The album was only available at concerts and from his online shop.

Also in 2008, Sam was honored with a star on Nirvana Studios - Wall of Fame.

There were plans to license the single &quot;Come Over Here&quot; from his LP &quot;Scream&quot; for episode 409 of the American series &quot;The L Word&quot;. However, the plans fell through due to problems involving the song&#x27;s co-writer and record label. The song also appears on the premier Music With a Twist compilation (Sony).

After having played Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival in 2006 solo, Bettens organized a band which, at the time, was identified as all-female, for a performance there in 2007.

In June 2012, he worked as a firefighter for a year in the Johnson City Fire Department.

Bettens has provided vocals for movie soundtracks, including &quot;Underworld&quot;, &quot;Wild Things&quot;, &quot;Zus and Zo&quot;, and &quot;Leef!&quot;.

===Rex Rebel===
In 2018, Sam formed the electronic music group Rex Rebel with fellow musicians Reinout Swinnen (K&#x27;s Choice&#x27;s keyboardist) and Wim Van der Westenthe (K&#x27;s Choice&#x27;s drummer). The band released its debut single, &quot;Big Shot&quot;, on 21 October 2019, and full-length debut album, &quot;Run&quot;, on 28 February 2020.

==Personal life==
On 17 May 2019 Bettens came out to the public as a transgender man and had his name changed from Sarah to Sam. Sam started transitioning in 2019. In a YouTube video, Bettens said, &quot;being transgender is not a choice. I always have been, I just didn&#x27;t know it until now.&quot; He said he is taking hormone replacement therapy and noted that this would affect his voice and singing, and that he was working with a voice coach. Before coming out as trans, there was a period where he publicly identified as a lesbian (starting in May 2002), and he has had a large lesbian fanbase since the beginning of his career with K&#x27;s Choice in the 90s.

Sam Bettens was born in Kapellen, Belgium. He currently lives in Palm Desert, California, having moved there from Johnson City, Tennessee in 2017, with his partner, two step-children, and two adopted children.

<doc id="873131" wikidata="Q5114670" url="?curid=873131" title="Chrysler LH engine">
<text>The LH engine was a series of V6 engines developed by Chrysler Corporation for its LH platform cars. It is a 60-degree V6 designed for front-wheel drive applications, later adapted to rear-wheel drive ones. The 2.7 liter LH engine is based on the SOHC 3.5 L engine, though bore spacing, cylinder bore, stroke, and assembly site are different.

== 2.7 L ==

The EER version debuted in 1998 and is built in Kenosha, Wisconsin. It is a DOHC 24-valve design. Bore and stroke is . It is an aluminum block with cast-iron cylinder liners and aluminum heads. Output has varied depending on the application but typical was at 5800 rpm with of torque at 4850 rpm. In terms of emissions, this was a TLEV engine; it runs on regular-octane (87) gasoline. Compression when launched in 1998 was 9.7:1 (increased to 9.9:1 in the LX cars). Redline occurred at 6,464 rpm, originally; and at 6,600 rpm as revised for the LX. The 24 valves are actuated by hydraulic end-pivot roller followers and hydraulic lifters. Fuel injection was sequential for six ports for all engines.

The 2.7 differed from the 3.5 liter engine from which it was derived in many ways. The Magnum version featured a variable intake system to create a &quot;supercharging&quot; effect at different engine speeds. A three-row chain replaced the timing belt of the 3.5 liter engine, and the 2.7 in the LX also has electronic throttle control and an enhancement to the intake manifold (described in greater detail below), the former to allow for the use of electronic stability control.

In 2004, the 2.7 liter engine was adapted for use in the LX series of cars, dropping peak power to at 6400 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm; but increasing torque at launch and during mid-range operation for everyday driving. Chrysler claimed that part-throttle torque was increased by up to 10% in the primary driving range, 2100–3400 rpm. Horsepower again dropped in 2009 on the LX cars to on the Chrysler 300 and Charger, but remains at 189 for the Chrysler Sebring.

=== Oil sludge and other known problems ===
Buildup of oil sludge is a common issue that plagues this engine. Higher than average operating temperature, an insufficient oil capacity and the timing chain driven water pump leaking into the crankcase are all factors in why this occurs . The 2.7 L V6 engines have suffered from oil sludge contamination. In February 2009, five separate class action lawsuits related to the alleged oil sludge defect were consolidated to the District of New Jersey. During the Chrysler bankruptcy proceedings, there was concern among consumer advocate groups that Chrysler&#x27;s proposed &quot;free and clear&quot; sale of assets to &quot;New Chrysler&quot; would allow the automaker to avoid liability for the oil sludge defect.

The engine was affected by an oil sludge problem and premature timing chain tensioner failure. The oil sludge issue appears to have been caused by issues with the crankcase ventilation system, and while it affected a minority of engines, it could cause complete failure In some cases, neglected maintenance aided in premature failure (missed oil changes or increased intervals between oil changes). Also this engine was plagued with issues regarding the water pump gasket leaking coolant internally and diluting the oil. Such coolant leaks must be addressed instantly or engine failure is imminent.

<doc id="873133" wikidata="Q17010586" url="?curid=873133" title="Differential TTL">
<text>Differential TTL is a type of binary electrical signaling based on the transistor-transistor logic (TTL) concept. It enables electronic systems to be relatively immune to noise. RS-422 and RS-485 outputs can be implemented as differential TTL.

Normal TTL signals are single-ended, which means that each signal consists of a voltage on one wire, referenced to a system ground. The &quot;low&quot; voltage level is zero to 0.8 volts, and the &quot;high&quot; voltage level is 2 volts to 5 volts. A differential TTL signal consists of two such wires, also referenced to a system ground. The logic level on one wire is always the complement of the other. The principle is similar to that of low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS), but with different voltage levels.

Differential TTL is used in preference to single-ended TTL for long-distance signaling. In a long cable, stray electromagnetic fields in the environment, or stray currents in the system ground, can induce unwanted voltages that cause errors at the receiver. With a differential pair of wires, roughly the same unwanted voltage is induced in each wire. The receiver subtracts the voltages on the two wires, so that the unwanted voltage disappears, and only the voltage created by the driver remains.

A second advantage of differential TTL is that the differential pair of wires can form a current loop. The driver sources a current from the power supply into one wire. This current passes along the wire to the receiver, through the termination resistor and back up the other wire, then back through the driver and down to ground. No net current is exchanged between the driver and receiver, which means that none of the signal current has to return through the ground connection (if there is one) between the two ends. This arrangement prevents the signal from injecting currents into the ground connection, which might upset other circuits attached to it.

Differential TTL is the most common type of high-voltage differential signaling (HVDS).

== Applications ==
Differential TTL signaling was used in the Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) standard devised by IBM, but this is mostly obsolete. More efficient signaling techniques such as LVDS are now used instead.

<doc id="873136" wikidata="Q1088787" url="?curid=873136" title="Chrysler Sebring">
<text>The Chrysler Sebring ( ) is a line of mid-size automobiles that was sold from 1995 through 2010 by Chrysler. Three generations of convertibles, two generations of sedans, and two generations of coupes were produced. Although the coupe shared the same name and some styling cues, it was mechanically unrelated to the other Sebring models.

The Sebring line was introduced in 1995 with the Chrysler Sebring coupe. It was the replacement for the Chrysler LeBaron coupe. In 1996 the convertible was introduced, replacing its LeBaron counterpart as well. For 2001, both body styles were redesigned and a sedan version was offered, replacing the Chrysler Cirrus. The coupe was discontinued after 2005 with no replacement model planned.

The redesigned sedan was introduced for 2007, and a convertible the following year. New options included all-wheel drive on sedans and an available retractable metal top for the convertible. All Sebring models were replaced by the Chrysler 200 for the 2011 model year.

==First generation (FJ/JX; 1995)==
The Chrysler Sebring was introduced as a coupe for 1995, and as a convertible in 1996, both models replacing the Chrysler LeBaron convertible and coupe. The convertible was built off the Chrysler JA platform also used for the Cirrus sedan, while the coupe was based on the Mitsubishi Eclipse. The Chrysler Sebring was named after Sebring, Florida, the site of the renowned endurance car race called the &quot;12 Hours of Sebring&quot;. The name was first used by Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s Plymouth division trim line of the Satellite mid-size coupe of the 1970s.

===Coupe (1995–2000)===
The 1995 through 2000 Chrysler Sebring coupe was the successor to the Chrysler LeBaron coupe.

The first generation Sebring coupe was introduced in April 1995, several months after the related Dodge Avenger. Despite its similarities to the Avenger, Chrysler&#x27;s suspension was tuned slightly on the softer side compared to Dodge&#x27;s stiff suspension. Although the Sebring did not really offer true &quot;off-the-line&quot; muscle, it did handle well over long, curvy roads, offering minimal body roll. LXi models further benefited from rear sway bars, a slightly different tuned fully independent suspension, along with 17-inch wheels wrapped with Goodyear Eagle performance tires. Recorded slalom speeds proved to be impressive for a car of its class, and were a result of Sebring&#x27;s 4-wheel double wishbone suspension and variable speed rack and pinion steering; both of which were key contributors to the car&#x27;s road manners.

The coupe version of the Sebring had seating for five and was considered to be one of the larger, more roomy coupes on the market. Trunk capacity was similar to that of many mid-size cars, capable of handling more than one set of golf clubs. At the time of its introduction, the Sebring sported a crosshair grille, reminiscent of the original Chrysler 300 letter series. The grille was non-functional, with the lower half under the bumper used for airflow intake in a &quot;bottom breather&quot; function.

The Sebring coupe was built on a Mitsubishi Motors platform shared by the Eagle Talon, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Mitsubishi Galant, and Dodge Avenger. They share a great deal with their Talon sibling, including much of their dash and instrument panel along with most mechanical components. Parts of the Sebring coupe cannot interchange with the sedan or convertible, which were not built by Mitsubishi.

The Sebring underwent a minor facelift for 1997. Its grille was replaced with a slightly larger black grid. The facelift also made the Sebring the first car to use Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;wings&quot; logo. The 1997 restyle also saw the addition of ribbed lower body cladding and new wheel styles. Features offered on Sebring coupes included 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, adaptive automatic transmissions, and fully independent suspensions, along with a host of power-operated features. Sebring also offered variable speed rack and pinion steering, 17-inch aluminum wheels with Goodyear Eagle tires, 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, one-touch power windows, one-touch moonroof, electrochromic mirror with compass, power accessory delay ignition (which allowed occupants to operate power window switches when the ignition is turned off), and Homelink universal transmitter, among other options. 

The Sebring coupe received a 5-star frontal safety rating, the highest rating possible. First-generation body style coupes continued to be sold past the 2000 model year to select export markets.

Trim levels:
*&quot;LX&quot; — 1995–2000
*&quot;LXi&quot; — 1995–2000

===Convertible (1996–2000)===
The Chrysler Sebring convertible was launched in 1996 alongside the Sebring coupe, replacing the LeBaron convertible. The convertible did not share any parts with the coupe and was instead based on the Chrysler Cirrus sedan. Consequently, both the Cirrus and the Sebring convertible were sold in Europe as the Stratus. 

All Stratus convertibles were assembled in Mexico. The Chrysler Stratus convertible was marketed in Mexico, but the sedan version was not. The Sebring convertible was sold alongside the Chrysler Stratus convertible in Mexico. In Mexico, a turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC I4 engine was optional.

Trim levels:
*&quot;JX&quot; — 1996–2000
*&quot;JXi&quot; — 1996–2000
*&quot;JXi Limited&quot; — 1998–2000

== Second generation (ST-22/JR; 2001) ==
The Sebring name was then used on three different cars for 2001: the coupe was based on the Mitsubishi Eclipse, while the sedan and convertible utilized the Chrysler JR platform successors to the Chrysler Cirrus. The 2004 Chrysler Sebring had received minor tweaks to its front end: a redesigned grille, reworked headlights, and a Chrysler winged emblem placed in the center on the rear deck; furthermore, after the 2004 Chrysler Sebring sedan had seen a mild cycle refresh, the company discontinued the Chrysler Sebring coupe after the 2005 model year. In Mexico, the Sebring was sold as the Chrysler Cirrus. Exclusive for the Cirrus was the availability of Chrysler&#x27;s turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC engine. The Cirrus was available as a sedan and convertible body styles. Models with this engine are identified with a &quot;High Output&quot; badge on the back of the vehicle. Also unique to the Cirrus were the trim levels; the sedan was offered in two while the convertible had only one. All were equipped with an automatic transmission.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives the 2001–2006 Sebring an &quot;Acceptable&quot; overall rating in frontal crash tests. In the side impact test, a &quot;Poor&quot; overall rating was given to models without side airbags. The IIHS did not test the Sebring with side airbags since Chrysler declined another test.


===Convertible===

For 2001, the Sebring Convertible was restyled. It now closely resembled the sedan, and continued to be built on the same platform as the sedan. Many interior and exterior components were carried over from the first-generation car. The Sebring received minor styling revisions (mostly the appearance of the front end) for the 2004 model year.

===Coupe===

A redesigned Sebring Coupe was introduced for the 2001 model year, based on the third-generation Mitsubishi Eclipse. Like the previous generation, the coupe shared very little in common with the sedan or the convertible, other than the name and a few exterior styling cues to help market all three vehicles together as one model. The Sebring Coupe received a minor facelift for 2003, and was discontinued after the 2005 model year.

The Sebring Coupe was only sold in Canada for the 2001 model year.

===European versions===

Chrysler also manufactured export versions of the 2001–2006 Sebring sedan and convertible for the mainland European market. Front and rear lights are to European standards, different from the USA &amp; Canada in that turn-signal indicators are orange, with additional side-turn repeaters on the front fenders. The rear bumper has a larger recess for the longer European-size license plates, and two rear fog lamps are fitted; one on each side of the license plate. The LHD headlamps incorporate Euro-type H4 bulbs, together with three-way up and down beam-level adjustment via a dash-mounted switch to the left of the steering wheel. Emissions controls are to the EURO 3 standard; later versions are compliant with EURO 4. Engine ranges offered were the 2.0 L DOHC 16V inline 4-cylinder (later replaced by the 2.4L unit in some countries), and the 2.7 L DOHC 24V 6-cylinder unit. The 2.0 and 2.4L engines are available with the 5-speed manual or four-speed 41TE auto transmission (depending on the country); the six-cylinder engine is automatic only.

The Canadian-market 240 km/h-160 mph speedometer (with km/h predominant) is fitted to the European models. The odometer and trip meter are in kilometers. As the 2001–2006 Sebring sedan and convertible were made in left-hand drive only, they were not sold in the UK and Ireland. Chrysler UK did, however, import 50 convertibles with the 2.7 L engine in 2001/2002, and these were sold through selected dealers. Being non-standard in Chrysler&#x27;s UK range at the time though, no more were imported.

Trim levels offered in Europe were LE (equivalent to North American market LX) and LX (equivalent to North American market LXi). From 2004, &quot;Touring&quot; and &quot;Limited&quot; versions started to replace the LE and LX designations respectively.

The lack of a diesel engine and right-hand drive availability prevented this Sebring from being a true pan-European model unlike other Chryslers such as the Chrysler 300M, PT Cruiser, and Voyager. In addition, the model was dropped from Chrysler&#x27;s lineup in some countries, notably France, before production ended in 2006. In France, the three domestic car-makers Peugeot, Citroen, and Renault dominate the new car market, which meant very low sales of the Sebring there. As a result, the sedan was only imported by Chrysler France in 2001 and 2002. The 2003 and facelifted 2004–2006 year models were not. The convertible was only sold until 2004. The 2005 and 2006 models were likewise not imported.

Despite not being available in the UK and Ireland, some Sebring convertibles have been brought in from the U.S. as grey imports. Some Euro-spec models have also been privately imported, mostly from Germany. The European versions are easier to re-register in the UK as they have EU-type approval. The dual km/h-mph speedo-display and twin rear foglights mean only headlamp beam-aim adjustment for left-hand traffic is necessary. The sedan is much rarer in the UK though; a few EU models have been imported, but most are likely from North America as grey imports.

===Trim Levels===

*Base (sedan and convertible 2004–2006) (coupe 2004–2005)
*&quot;GTC&quot; (Convertible 2002–2006)
*&quot;Limited&quot; (sedan 2004–2006) (convertible 2001–2006) (coupe 2004–2005)

*&quot;TSi&quot; (sedan 2005–2006)

Note: Additional packages could be added to various standard trim levels.

===Volga Siber===
In 2006, the license, tooling, and assembly line for the second-generation Chrysler Sebring/Dodge Stratus sedan was sold to Russian firm GAZ for about US$151 million (€ 124 million). After some minor modifications the vehicle was renamed the Volga Siber. It went into production in March 2008 at the Gorky Automobile Plant in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. However, due to the Great Recession sales were not as expected and production ended in 2010 after 9,000 examples were built.

== Third generation (JS; 2007) ==
The Sebring was replaced with a new model based on the JS platform for the 2007 model year. The third-generation Sebring was assembled in Sterling Heights, Michigan, containing over 82% of parts sourced in North America. Since no 2007 convertible was offered, the 2006 Sebring convertible was left to fill the void, remaining in showrooms and on the company&#x27;s website until the 2008 model&#x27;s release. The third-generation Sebring borrowed many styling cues from the 2003 Chrysler Airflite concept. It also has several Chrysler-signature styling cues, several of which were borrowed from the Chrysler Crossfire. The Sebring sedan and convertible were also sold in right-hand drive through Chrysler&#x27;s UK and Ireland dealer network.
Chrysler offered three engines for the 2007 Sebring; the GEMA I4, the EER V6, and the EGF V6. The 3.5 L V6 is coupled to Chrysler&#x27;s first ever six-speed automatic transmission, which employs Autostick technology, and the 2.7 L V6 is capable of running on cleaner-burning E85. Export vehicles will be offered with a 2.0 L turbocharged PDTDI (pumpe düse) diesel made by Volkswagen and the 2.0 L GEMA engine. The 3.5 L V6 sedan is available with all-wheel drive as an extra cost option for 2008 only.

Trim levels:
*base — 2007
*&quot;LX&quot; — 2008 (replaced base)
*&quot;Touring&quot; — (2007–2010)
*&quot;Limited AWD&quot; — (2008)
*&quot;Limited&quot; — (2007–2010)

In 2008, the optional &quot;MyGIG Multimedia Infotainment System&quot; became available. In addition, the Limited received the 2.4 L four-cylinder engine and was priced at the same level as the 2008 Touring model. Also for 2009, the rear badge placements were modified. For the model 2010 year, the hood was redesigned, eliminating the longitudinal grooves. The IIHS gave the 2010 Models a G for good in the frontal crash test, the side impact test, and the roof strength test, giving the 2010 Sebring a &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot;.

===Convertible===
For the 2008 model year, the Sebring convertible was redesigned with hood strakes recalling the Chrysler Crossfire. The new convertible body style debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles International Auto Show as an early-2008 model. It was the second bestselling four-place open-top cars in the United States, trailing only the Ford Mustang convertible.

The new convertible offered both a retractable hardtop and soft tops, with the Sebring&#x27;s roofs manufactured by Karmann. A vinyl top came on the base LX model, a cloth roof on the Touring and Limited models with the option of a retractable metal top. The convertible top retracts into the trunk with a power tonneau cover and a luggage protector for the top. The top can also be retracted with the remote keyless entry, meaning the top can be stowed without being inside the car or starting the engine.

The LX model included a new 2.4 L I4 engine, the Touring version came with a retuned version of the 2.7 L V6, while the Limited featured a new 3.5 L V6. Unlike the Sebring sedan, the convertible was not available in all-wheel drive.

===Chinese versions===

Production of the Chrysler Sebring sedan for the China market began in 2007 at the Beijing-Benz DaimlerChrysler Automotive Co. (BBDC) in Beijing. BBDC is a joint venture between the Beijing Automotive Industry Holding and Chrysler.

Production of the Sebring leveraged assembly capacity for the new BBDC plant which also built the Chrysler 300C, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and Mitsubishi Outlander.

Four-cylinder World Engines for the Sebring were built at the Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance (GEMA) plant in Dundee, Michigan for export to China. GEMA began as a joint venture of Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai. Since 2009, GEMA is wholly owned by Chrysler.

===European version===
Chrysler introduced this generation Sebring in the European markets (including right-hand drive markets) as their first competitor in the D-segment. It received a generally unfavorable reception from European motoring journalists.

===Mid-cycle refresh and replacement===

The Chrysler Sebring was extensively refreshed in 2010, but was rebadged as the Chrysler 200. The JS platform and bodyshell had been retained, but there were extensive cosmetic and powertrain changes to the vehicle. The name change helped distance the vehicle from the Sebring&#x27;s reputation for quality issues and fleet pervasiveness.

<doc id="873137" wikidata="Q56304279" url="?curid=873137" title="Landed gentry">
<text>The landed gentry, or the gentry (sometimes collectively known as the squirearchy), is a largely historical Irish and British social class of landowners who could live entirely from rental income, or at least had a country estate. It is the British element of the wider European class of gentry. While part of the British aristocracy, and usually armigers, the gentry ranked below the British peerage (or &quot;titled nobility&quot;) in social status. Nevertheless, their economic base in land was often similar, and some of the landed gentry were wealthier than some peers. Many gentry were close relatives of peers, and it was not uncommon for gentry to marry into peerage. With or without noble title, owning rural land estates often brought with it the legal rights of the feudal lordship of the manor, and the less formal name or title of &quot;squire&quot;, in Scotland laird.

Generally lands passed by primogeniture, while the inheritances of daughters and younger sons were in cash or stocks, and relatively small. Typically the gentry farmed some of their land through employed managers, but leased most of it to tenant farmers. They also exploited timber and minerals (such as coal), and owned mills and other sources of income. Many heads of families also had careers in politics or the military, and the younger sons of the gentry provided a high proportion of the clergy, military officers, and lawyers. Successful burghers often used their accumulated wealth to buy country estates, with the aim of establishing themselves as landed gentry.

The decline of the gentry largely began with the 1870s agricultural depression; however, there are still many hereditary gentry in the UK. The book series &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot; records the names of members of this class.

The designation &quot;landed gentry&quot; originally referred exclusively to members of the upper class who were both landlords and commoners (in the British sense)—that is, they did not hold peerages. But by the late 19th century, the term was also applied to peers, such as the Duke of Westminster, who lived on landed estates.

==Origin of the term==
The term &quot;gentry&quot; derives from &quot;gentrice&quot;, a word indicating high birth, high status, or gentleness. The term gradually came to be used for the lower ranks of the aristocracy, which along with the peerage had previously been considered part of the nobility. In the 16th and 17th centuries, writers referred to the peerage as the (Latin for &quot;greater nobility&quot;) and the gentry as the (Latin for &quot;minor nobility&quot;). Eventually, the terms nobility and gentry came to refer to completely separate classes.

==Definition and ranks==
The gentry were aristocratic landowners who were not peers. According to historian G. E. Mingay, the gentry were landowners whose wealth &quot;made possible a certain kind of education, a standard of comfort, and a degree of leisure and a common interest in ways of spending it&quot;. Leisure distinguished gentry from businessmen who gained their wealth through work. The gentry, did not enterprise or marketeer but were known most for working in management of estates; their income came largely from rents paid by tenant farmers living these estates. By the 17th century, the gentry was divided into four ranks:

# Baronet: a hereditary title created by James I in 1611, giving the holder the right to be addressed as &quot;Sir&quot;.
# Knight: originally a mounted warrior who fought for the king and his barons during the Middle Ages. Knighthood eventually lost its martial connotations and was awarded to civilians in honour of service to the Crown. Like baronets, knights are addressed as &quot;Sir&quot;; however, the rank of knight is not hereditary.
# Esquire: originally a knight&#x27;s attendant or squire. In the 14th century, this rank could be conferred by the Crown. Certain officeholders, such as justices of the peace, were considered to be esquires. It was also applied to the sons of peers and the firstborn sons of baronets and knights.
# Gentleman: the lowest rank within the gentry. Gentlemen ranked above yeomen or landowning farmers. The Statute of Additions of 1413 recognised gentlemen as a distinct social rank, but the line between the lower gentry and the yeomanry remained blurred. 

In a historiographical survey, Peter Coss describes a number of approaches to deciding who was gentry. One is to view the gentry as those recognised legally as possessing gentility. However, Coss finds this method unsatisfactory because it &quot;seems certain that gentility was widely felt and articulated within society long before legislation was in place to tell us so&quot;. Other historians define gentry by land ownership and income level, but there is still the problem of whether this should include professionals and town dwellers. Rosemary Horrox argues that an urban gentry existed in the 15th century. For some historians of early modern England, the gentry included families with coats of arms, but Coss notes that not all gentry were armigerous. Coss proposes that the gentry had three main characteristics: (1) landownership, (2) a nobility or gentility (shared with the peerage) that distinguished them from the rest of the population, and (3) a territorial-based collective identity and power over the larger population.

==Occupations==

From the late 16th-century, the gentry emerged as the class most closely involved in politics, the military and law profession. It provided the bulk of Members of Parliament, with many gentry families maintaining political control in a certain locality over several generations (see List of political families in the United Kingdom). Owning land was a prerequisite for suffrage (the civil right to vote) in county constituencies until the Reform Act 1832; until then, Parliament was largely in the hands of the landowning class.

The gentry ranked above the agricultural sector&#x27;s middle class: the larger tenant farmers, who rented land from the landowners, and yeoman farmers, who were defined as &quot;a person qualified by possessing free land of forty shillings annual [feudal] value, and who can serve on juries and vote for a Knight of the Shire. He is sometimes described as a small landowner, a farmer of the middle classes.&quot; Anthony Richard Wagner, Richmond Herald wrote that &quot;a Yeoman would not normally have less than 100 acres&quot; (40 hectares) and in social status is one step down from the gentry, but above, say, a husbandman. So while yeoman farmers owned enough land to support a comfortable lifestyle, they nevertheless farmed it themselves and were excluded from the &quot;landed gentry&quot; because they worked for a living, and were thus &quot;in trade&quot; as it was termed. Apart from a few &quot;honourable&quot; professions connected with the governing elite (the clergy of the established church, the officer corps of the British Armed Forces, the diplomatic and civil services, the bar or the judiciary), such occupation was considered demeaning by the upper classes, particularly by the 19th century, when the earlier mercantile endeavours of younger sons were increasingly discontinued. Younger sons, who could not expect to inherit the family estate, were instead urged into professions of state service. It became a pattern in many families that while the eldest son would inherit the estate and enter politics, the second son would join the army, the third son go into law profession, and the fourth son join the church.

A newly rich man who wished his family to join the gentry (and they nearly all did so wish), was expected not only to buy a country house and estate, but often also to sever financial ties with the business which had made him wealthy in order to cleanse his family of the &quot;taint of trade&quot;, depending somewhat on what that business was. However, during the 18th and 19th centuries, as the new rich of the Industrial Revolution became more and more numerous and politically powerful, this expectation was gradually relaxed.

==Landed gentry and nobility==

Persons who are closely related to peers are also more correctly described as gentry than as nobility, since the latter term, in the modern British Isles, is synonymous with &quot;peer&quot;. However, this popular usage of &quot;nobility&quot; omits the distinction between titled and untitled nobility. The titled nobility in Britain are the peers of the realm, whereas the untitled nobility comprise those here described as gentry.

David Cannadine wrote that the gentry&#x27;s lack of titles &quot;did not matter, for it was obvious to contemporaries that the landed gentry were all for practical purposes the equivalent of continental nobles, with their hereditary estates, their leisured lifestyle, their social pre-eminence, and their armorial bearings&quot;. British armigerous families who hold no title of nobility are represented, together with those who hold titles through the College of Arms, by the Commission and Association for Armigerous Families of Great Britain at CILANE. Through grants of arms, new families are admitted into the untitled nobility regularly, thus making the gentry a class that remains open both legally and practically.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the names and families of those with titles (specifically peers and baronets, less often including those with the non-hereditary title of knight) were often listed in books or manuals known as &quot;Peerages&quot;, &quot;Baronetages&quot;, or combinations of these categories, such as the &quot;Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage&quot;. As well as listing genealogical information, these books often also included details of the right of a given family to a coat of arms. They were comparable to the Almanach de Gotha in continental Europe. 

In the 1830s, one peerage publisher, John Burke, expanded his market and his readership by publishing a similar volume for people without titles, which was called &quot;A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Commoners&quot;. &quot;Burke&#x27;s Commoners&quot; was published in four volumes from 1833 to 1838. Subsequent editions were re-titled &quot;A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry; or, Commons of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; or &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry.&quot;

The popularity of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot; gave currency to the expression &quot;Landed Gentry&quot; as a description of the untitled upper classes in England (although the book also included families in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, where, however, social structures were rather different). &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot; continued to appear at regular intervals throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. A review of the 1952 edition in &quot;Time&quot; noted:

==Contemporary status==

The Great Depression of British Agriculture at the end of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging outright sales, from the mid-20th century.

So devastating was this for the ranks formerly identified as being of the landed gentry that &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot; began, in the 20th century, to include families historically in this category who had ceased to own their ancestral lands. The focus of those who remained in this class shifted from the lands or estates themselves, to the stately home or &quot;family seat&quot; which was in many cases retained without the surrounding lands. Many of these buildings were purchased for the nation and preserved as monuments to the lifestyles of their former owners (who sometimes remained in part of the house as lessees or tenants) by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. The National Trust, which had originally concentrated on open landscapes rather than buildings, accelerated its country house acquisition programme during and after the Second World War, partly because of the widespread destruction of country houses in the 20th century by owners who could no longer afford to maintain them. Those who retained their property usually had to supplement their incomes from sources other than the land, sometimes by opening their properties to the public.

In the 21st century, the term &quot;landed gentry&quot; is still used, as the landowning class still exists, but it increasingly refers more to historic than to current landed wealth or property in a family. Moreover, the deference which was once automatically given to members of this class by most British people has almost completely dissipated as its wealth, political power and social influence have declined, and other social figures such as celebrities have grown to take their place in the public&#x27;s interest.

<doc id="873144" wikidata="Q4870541" url="?curid=873144" title="Battle of Bramall Lane">
<text>The &quot;Battle of Bramall Lane&quot; is a name used by the British press to refer to an English First Division football match played between Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion at Bramall Lane, Sheffield on 16 March 2002. It is the only match in English professional football history to have been abandoned due to a shortage of players. Going into the match, Sheffield United were comfortably mid-table with neither promotion or relegation possible, while Albion were fighting for promotion to the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The two clubs were not historically seen as rivals, and the fixture was not a local derby, but there was history between United midfielder Georges Santos and Albion midfielder Andy Johnson due to an injury Santos suffered from a collision with Johnson in a previous meeting.

United goalkeeper Simon Tracey was sent off in the 9th minute for deliberately handling the ball outside the area to stop a shot at goal. Albion striker Scott Dobie gave his side the lead going into half-time, and midfielder Derek McInnes doubled the lead in the 63rd minute, prompting United manager Neil Warnock to make two substitutions; Santos and Patrick Suffo came on, but both received red cards within moments. Santos committed a dangerous two-footed tackle on Johnson, and Suffo headbutted McInnes in the ensuing melee. Down to eight men, United conceded a third goal, with Dobie scoring his second of the afternoon. United midfielder Michael Brown and defender Robert Ullathorne suffered injuries that meant they could no longer take part in the match. Because United had already used all of their allowed substitutions, referee Eddie Wolstenholme, who had already declined to send off both Brown and captain Keith Curle for clear red-card offences, was forced to abandon the match in the 82nd minute, as dictated by the rules of the game.

A week later, Albion were awarded a 3–0 victory by The Football League, while United, Warnock and several United players received bans and fines from The Football Association. Warnock faced allegations of cheating from Albion manager Gary Megson, sparking a long-lasting feud between the two managers. Neither Santos nor Suffo ever played for United again, departing the club in the following months.

==Background==

With eight league matches of the 2001–02 season remaining, West Bromwich Albion were in third place in the First Division on 67 points, 11 points behind their Black Country rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, who occupied the second automatic promotion spot. Meanwhile, Sheffield United were in 15th position on 50 points, safe from relegation but not threatening the playoff places. Albion manager Gary Megson had nearly been appointed United manager in 1999, following a spell at Stoke City, and had a meeting with chairmen Derek Dooley and Bernard Procter; he turned down the role, citing his long-time affinity towards rivals Sheffield Wednesday, and United instead turned to Neil Warnock, who was manager going into the match.

In a First Division fixture on 10 March 2001 between United and Nottingham Forest, United midfielder Georges Santos was substituted off early in the match, with what was believed to be a concussion. Warnock revealed his disappointment that the referee took no action against Forest midfielder Andy Johnson, who had caused the injury. Santos underwent a five-and-a-half-hour operation on a double fracture of his eye socket, and spoke with his lawyers about the possibility of taking legal action. Johnson defended himself, saying he was &quot;totally blameless&quot;, as it was Santos who was late in the challenge, but Warnock accused him of lying. Later in the year, Johnson moved to Albion.

The first fixture of the season between United and Albion was decided by a last-minute goal from Carl Asaba that gave United a 1–0 victory despite having Shane Nicholson sent off.

==Match==

Nine minutes into the match, United goalkeeper Simon Tracey was sent off by referee Eddie Wolstenholme for deliberately handling the ball outside the penalty area and denying Albion an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock sent on the substitute keeper, Wilko de Vogt, in place of striker Peter Ndlovu. Albion defender Lárus Sigurðsson received a yellow card shortly after. Albion opened the scoring in the 18th minute, when striker Scott Dobie headed in a cross from Andy Johnson.

Albion were unable to take further advantage of having an extra man until the 62nd minute, when captain Derek McInnes scored their second with a powerful shot, struck first-time from outside the area, that De Vogt was unable to reach. Warnock responded by making two substitutions, the last of his allowed three, in an attempt to make his team more attacking, taking off Gus Uhlenbeek and Michael Tonge for Georges Santos and Patrick Suffo.

The match quickly turned ugly; a stray ball from McInnes in midfield, later described by United striker Laurent D&#x27;Jaffo as a &quot;pass from God&quot;, led to Santos being sent off for a high and poorly timed lunging tackle on Johnson, the studs of his boot connecting with the Welsh midfielder&#x27;s shin. The two teams then began a mass brawl on the pitch, and amid the ensuing melee, Suffo headbutted McInnes in full view of referee Wolstenholme, an action so violent it caused the Albion player to bleed, and Suffo was also sent off. Albion defender Darren Moore was visibly angered by the actions of the United players, and had to be physically restrained by D&#x27;Jaffo; Johnson said it was like Moore &quot;had the devil in him&quot;. By the time play resumed, United had been reduced to eight men, and had none of their three allotted substitutions remaining. Soon after, United captain Keith Curle was fortunate to avoid a sending off after appearing to throw punches at McInnes, as was Michael Brown for a foul on the same player, clambering over him as Albion made a breakaway. Wolstenholme later admitted to not awarding red cards and keeping both players on the field in order to finish the match.

In the 77th minute, Albion added a third goal when Dobie tapped in his second of the match from close range after United&#x27;s defence were unable to clear an Albion corner kick. Two minutes later, Brown limped off for United with a suspected groin injury, and was soon followed by Robert Ullathorne, who went off injured in the 82nd minute suffering with muscle spasms, and reducing the team to six men. In accordance with Law 3 of the Laws of the Game, which states &quot;that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team&quot;, referee Wolstenholme abandoned the game with Albion leading 3–0, marking the first time a match in English professional football had ever been abandoned through the implementation of this law in the history of English football.

===Details===


==Aftermath==
After the match, Albion manager Gary Megson said:
Football League spokesman John Nagle released a statement saying, &quot;The Football League have the authority to allow the result to stand, or to order the game to be replayed&quot;, and confirmed there would be a meeting the following Thursday to discuss the matter. Writing for the BBC, journalist Phil McNulty said he believed Neil Warnock and Sheffield United should face heavy punishment, and argued for a points deduction. Warnock, though, echoed Megson&#x27;s comments, saying, &quot;there is no place for that in any game of football, let alone a professional match&quot;, but joked that he&#x27;d &quot;have brought a deckchair out on the pitch to keep one of [the injured players] on&quot; had he known the match would be called off. In the changing room, Megson told Moore that if a replay was necessary, he would bring Albion&#x27;s youth team. Speaking to the &quot;Lancashire Telegraph&quot;, referee Eddie Wolstenholme said he was correct in sending off all three of the United players, and knew immediately that, once Ullathorne was leaving the field due to injury, he would be forced to abandon the match.

Warnock faced accusations of cheating from Megson, who claimed that Warnock was telling his players to find a way to come off the field. Warnock described the comments as &quot;disgraceful&quot; and accused Megson of hypocrisy, drawing comparisons between his situation and that of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, which had occurred six months earlier. Brown and Ullathorne&#x27;s injuries were legitimate, however; Brown missed the rest of the season, and Ullathorne missed the following four matches; Warnock was ultimately not mentioned in Wolstenholme&#x27;s match report, declaring that his fourth official had not informed him of any remarks. Warnock placed Santos on the transfer list, and told Suffo he would never play for United again, and it marked the final time either player appeared for the club. Johnson accused Santos of deliberately attempting to hurt him or possibly end his career; he was forced to miss several matches with an injury. Less than two months after the match, Suffo left United and joined Spanish club Numancia, while Santos was released in the summer and ultimately signed for Grimsby Town following a trial period.

Albion were awarded a 3–0 win and the three points by The Football League. The decision was unanimous, and Nagle said &quot;any other decision would be grossly unfair and set a precedent that would not be in the best interests of the game&quot;. United were fined £10,000 by The Football Association, Santos was given a six-match ban (four, plus two for violent conduct), Suffo paid a £3,000 fine and received a six-match ban (three for the dismissal, three for violent conduct), and Keith Curle was made to pay a fine of £500 and received a two-match ban, while Warnock was made to pay £300 for &quot;improper conduct towards the fourth official&quot;, but no evidence was found that either he or any player had made a deliberate attempt to have the match abandoned. Following the verdict, Albion chief executive John Wile said there was no &quot;bad blood&quot; between the clubs, and said the decision to award the points was correct. Following United&#x27;s midweek victory against Millwall, Warnock expressed his displeasure regarding the reaction he had received in the media, saying, &quot;I thought in this country people are innocent until proven guilty, but some of the comments in the papers were out of order&quot;, and said he and his family had endured an &quot;absolute bloody nightmare&quot;.

United ultimately finished the season 13th in the league table, while Albion finished second and were automatically promoted.
===Legacy===
The next meeting between the clubs came at Albion&#x27;s stadium, The Hawthorns, on 14 October 2003, during the 2003–04 season. United won 2–0 to go top of the table. Warnock received an abusive reception from the Albion supporters and refused to shake Megson&#x27;s hand before the match, but joked afterwards that he had a crash helmet in the event of a repeat. The return fixture came on 21 February 2004, and the away side again emerged victorious as Albion recovered from a goal down to win 2–1, with the winning goal coming five minutes from time. Megson praised his team for overcoming the negative atmosphere, in which both sets of supporters &quot;exchanged derogatory chants with even greater fervour than is customary&quot;, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist John Ashdown; Albion midfielder Johnson was particularly targeted. The feud between Warnock and Megson continued when Megson moved to Nottingham Forest, and on one occasion Warnock was quoted as saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t shake his hands in a million years. I wouldn&#x27;t piss on him if he was on fire&quot;. In a 2022 interview with &quot;The Mirror&quot;, Megson described the name Battle of Bramall Lane as a misnomer as it &quot;suggests there were two teams battling&quot; and apportioned the blame solely to Warnock.

Speaking in 2020 to the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot;, Suffo explained that his actions were solely in defence of teammate Santos, and described it as a highlight of his career on par with winning the 2000 Olympics and playing in the 2002 FIFA World Cup for Cameroon, but also spoke of his regret of the incident as he had begun to feel settled at the club. The close relationship between United club executive Derek Dooley and Megson was said to be severely damaged by the event. Suffo&#x27;s teammate Michael Brown later described the match as &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot;, and spoke of his regret about being involved in such a match while appearing on BT Sport in 2020. Curle has described the match as &quot;surreal&quot; and &quot;farcical&quot;, while Albion striker Bob Taylor believed it was unforgettable for those involved and in attendance.

<doc id="873156" wikidata="Q635333" url="?curid=873156" title="Anodorhynchus">
<text>Anodorhynchus is a genus of large blue macaws from open and semi-open habitats in central and eastern South America. It includes two extant species, the hyacinth macaw and Lear&#x27;s macaw also known as the indigo macaw, and one probably extinct species, the glaucous macaw. At about in length the hyacinth macaw is the longest parrot in the world. Glaucous and Lear&#x27;s macaws are exclusively cliff nesters; hyacinth macaws are mostly tree nesters. The three species mainly feed on the nuts from a few species of palms (notably &quot;Acrocomia aculeata&quot;, &quot;Attalea phalerata&quot;, &quot;Butia yatay&quot; and &quot;Syagrus coronata&quot;).

While blue macaws have been known from taxidermic and captive specimens since at least 1790, location of the Lear&#x27;s macaw&#x27;s endemic habitat wasn&#x27;t known until 1978. 
The glaucous macaw was extirpated in the 1800s by clearance for agriculture and cattle grazing of the yatay palm (Butia yatay) groves upon which it fed, though rumors of its continued existence persist. Lear&#x27;s macaws have made a comeback from near extinction in the early 1980s (about 60 birds) to over 1000 as a result of conservation programs. Hyacinth macaws remain locally common within parts of their range, but their range has become fragmented into three known distinct populations in southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia and northeastern Paraguay; populations are declining due to extensive trapping for the pet trade as well as habitat loss.

All &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot; macaws are listed on CITES Appendix I.

==Taxonomy==
The genus, &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot; is one of six genera of Central and South American macaws in tribe &quot;Arini&quot; of macaws, parakeets and closely related genera. The macaws and parakeets comprise the clade of long-tailed parrots which with sister clade the short-tailed Amazonian parrots and allies make up subfamily &quot;Arinae&quot; of Neotropical parrots in family &quot;Psittacidae&quot; of true parrots. There are three currently recognized species (two extant and one probably extinct), all monotypic:

Some recent commentators have suggested that the allopatric Lear&#x27;s macaw and glaucous macaw should be considered conspecifics.

Besides the three recognised species, there is the violet macaw, &quot;Anodorhynchus purpurascens&quot;, which was described by Rothschild and featured in his book, &quot;Extinct Birds&quot; published in 1907, but there is very little evidence to support it as separate species and it should be regarded as a hypothetical extinct species. In the absence of a specimen, Rothschild scientifically described and named it as a separate species based on the evidence that violet macaws were said to have inhabited the island of Guadeloupe; however, they were probably hyacinth macaws imported from the mainland of South America.

<text>The Bridgewater Four are four men who were tried and found guilty of killing 13-year-old paperboy Carl Bridgewater, who was shot in the head at close range near Stourbridge, England, in 1978. In February 1997, after almost two decades of imprisonment, their convictions were overturned and the three surviving defendants were released; the fourth defendant had died in prison two years into his sentence. Bridgewater&#x27;s murder remains unsolved.

The investigations were carried out by the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, which was later disbanded after an inquiry into corruption and mismanaged investigations.

==Murder==
Carl Bridgewater (2 January 1965 – 19 September 1978) was shot dead on 19 September 1978 at Yew Tree Farm near Stourbridge, West Midlands, while delivering a newspaper to the house. The occupants of the house, elderly cousins Mary Poole and Fred Jones, were not home at the time. Police believed that Carl Bridgewater had arrived at the house and disturbed an intruder or burglar, and was subsequently forced into the living room of the house where he was shot once in the head at close range with a shotgun.

==Conviction and sentencing==
The Bridgewater Four were Patrick Molloy, James Robinson and cousins Michael and Vincent Hickey. They came to the attention of police working on the murder investigation following further armed robberies later in 1978. On 24 November, Robinson, Hickey and an unidentified third man carried out an armed robbery at a Tesco supermarket on the Castle Vale estate in Birmingham. Hickey and Robinson raided the safe while the third man held several terrified shoppers at bay with a gun. When the store manager tried to intervene, a shot was fired over his head.

Six days later, Robinson and the Hickey cousins robbed an elderly couple at Chapel Farm, Romsley, near Halesowen. Vincent stayed in the car while Robinson and Michael charged into the house wearing balaclavas, brandishing a shotgun and shouting for money. The victims of this robbery displayed great courage but the robbers got away with £200. Robinson took the lead, hitting one of the victims with the gun but not firing it.

Molloy was the first to be arrested. During questioning which also covered the murder, Molloy told police that he had been in an upstairs bedroom at Yew Tree Farm while robbing the house when he heard a gunshot downstairs. Shortly afterwards, the other three men were arrested.

All denied committing murder, but three of them were convicted of murder at Stafford Crown Court on 9 November 1979. The fourth, Molloy, was found guilty of manslaughter. They were sentenced on 12 November.

James Robinson (aged 45) and Vincent Hickey (aged 25) were both sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 25 years, which would have kept them behind bars until at least 2004 and the ages of 70 and 50 respectively. Michael Hickey (aged 18) was sentenced to be detained indefinitely at Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, though it was anticipated he would serve a shorter sentence than the two others convicted of murder due to his age. Patrick Molloy (aged 51) received a 12-year prison sentence on the manslaughter charge, but he died of a heart attack in prison, two years later.

==Case quashed==
An appeal in March 1989 was rejected, but on 21 February 1997, the convictions of the men were overturned after the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial had been unfair, due to certain areas of evidence fabricated by police in order to persuade the now-deceased Molloy to confess. The Appeal Judges noted that there might still be sufficient evidence to convict Vincent Hickey, but the Crown Prosecution Service chose not to apply for a retrial or to prosecute him on another charge of armed robbery.

The campaign to free and absolve the four men was led by Michael Hickey&#x27;s mother, Ann Whelan, and campaigning journalist Paul Foot. Preparations were made for a case against four police officers in the Staffordshire force on charges of fabricating evidence, but the case was dropped in December 1998.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a Home Office-appointed assessor that the Hickey cousins should lose a quarter of loss-of-earnings compensation for their free food and accommodation inside prison.

Robinson died on 30 August 2007 of lung cancer at the age of 73.

==Bert Spencer==
Over the years, convicted murderer Bert Spencer (born 1939) has been mentioned in the media as a possible suspect in the murder. Spencer, a uniformed ambulance driver who worked at Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge lived in Wordsley and was a neighbour of Bridgewater, living five houses away. He was investigated by police in the immediate aftermath of the murder, not least because he drove a blue Vauxhall Viva – the same type of car which had been seen at the farm on the afternoon of the murder. Witnesses also said that the driver of the car was a uniformed man. Spencer had a shotgun licence and was regularly allowed to shoot at Yew Tree Farm. However, he was eliminated from police inquiries within a few months after the arrest of the four other suspects. In December 1979, at a party at neighbouring Holloway Farm to celebrate Spencer&#x27;s 40th birthday, Spencer shot dead 70-year-old Hubert Wilkes. He admitted to this while claiming it was a case of manslaughter and not murder. Like Carl, Hubert Wilkes had been shot while sitting on a sofa. Spencer was imprisoned for life in 1980 and served 15 years before being paroled in 1995.

Spencer is featured in a book, &quot;Scapegoat for Murder: The Truth About the Killing of Carl Bridgewater&quot; (D&amp;B Publishing), written by true crime author, Simon W. Golding. The author invited criminologist David Wilson to interview Spencer, and in June 2016, Channel 4 screened a television documentary, &quot;Interview with a Murderer&quot;. In the course of the &quot;interview of the year&quot;, Spencer&#x27;s daughter revealed that she felt that her father was at Yew Tree Farm on the day of Bridgwater&#x27;s killing &quot;and possibly saw something&quot;. An ambulance station secretary (who was also a friend) who had provided the &quot;cast iron&quot; alibi that he had been &quot;at work all day&quot;, admitted that she could not be sure that Spencer had not left at some point. Prof. Wilson, in his final meeting with Spencer, told him that he saw through Spencer&#x27;s &quot;kindly old grandfather schtick&quot;, adding that a P-scan test indicated Spencer was a manipulative and callous psychopath. The documentary concluded with Wilson interviewing Spencer&#x27;s former wife, who had not spoken publicly before. She said that the day after the murder, Spencer told her he was disposing of his shotgun. She added that, Spencer having chosen to revive the issue to protest his innocence, it seemed likely that the police would reopen the case. However, in March 2017, after looking at the allegations in the television programme, the police told Spencer they would not be taking any action against him.

Spencer initiated court proceedings in May 2024 against author Simon W. Golding, as he claims Golding&#x27;s book &quot;Scapegoat for Murder: The Truth About the Killing of Carl Bridgewater&quot; is plagiarized from his own manuscripts, prepared while he was in prison - in 1993/4 with his cell mate, Frank Roden. Golding said: “I’ll go to prison before I send him a penny. The over-riding emotion is anger.”

To date, neither Spencer nor anyone else other than the Bridgewater Four has been charged with the murder of Carl Bridgewater.

<text>Rodney Yee is an American yoga instructor who rose to national prominence in the mid-1990s when he was featured on the cover of &quot;Yoga Journal&quot; magazine and later starred in a series of Gaiam/Living Arts yoga instructional videos and DVDs. Yee has narrated meditation audios and written two books.

== Early life and education ==
Rodney Yee was born in 1957, the Chinese-American son of an Air Force Colonel, and spent his childhood on military bases in Altus, Oklahoma and Puerto Rico. He was a gymnast during his high school years and later became a ballet dancer, performing with the Oakland Ballet Company and the Matsuyama Ballet Company of Tokyo, Japan. He began studies in philosophy and physical therapy at the University of California, Berkeley, though he dropped out in order to pursue ballet full-time.

== Career ==
Yee became a yoga enthusiast in the Iyengar school, but now teaches a blend of Iyengar Yoga and his own invented style. He began his yoga teaching career at a studio called The Yoga Room in Berkeley; in 1987 he co-founded the Piedmont Yoga Studio in Oakland.

In 2002, several students of Yee&#x27;s stated that they were having sexual relations with Yee and that the behavior had been going on for some time. Yee was sued for breach of contract, the claim alleging multiple sexual affairs with his students.

==Personal life==
Yee has three children from his first marriage to Donna Fone, whom he divorced in 2002 after twenty-four years of marriage. He married former model Colleen Saidman, one of his students, in December 2006. Since dating students violates the precepts of yoga teacher conduct as defined by the Yoga Alliance, this led to division in Yee-oriented communities. Yee and Saidman live in The Hamptons.

<doc id="873177" wikidata="Q5114665" url="?curid=873177" title="Chrysler JA platform">
<text>The JA platform was Chrysler&#x27;s smaller complement to the LH cars which were larger than the Ks, and a direct size replacement for the last extended K cars, the Acclaim and Spirit. It was a mid-size front-wheel drive automobile platform that was the basis for the &quot;Cloud Cars&quot; – the Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus/Plymouth Breeze starting in 1994. Like the LH, it was a cab forward design. While this platform was numerically successful, the highest volume for family cars competing against cars like the Taurus, Accord, or Camry would move to the LH platform cars, which were often classified as full-size.

==1995==
The first JA cars were the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus. These were available with either a 2.0 L 16-valve SOHC, 2.4 L 16-valve DOHC, or a Mitsubishi-designed 2.5 L 24-valve SOHC V6 engine. The Plymouth Breeze was introduced in late 1995 with most of the same options available to the other two models (minus the V6 engine). The JA Platform was produced through to the 2000 model year.

A five-speed manual transmission (NV-T350) was available with the 2.0 L engine, and a four-speed automatic (A604) came with the larger engines. AutoStick was an option for some trim levels with the 2.5 L engine. The wheelbase was .
All JA sedans were built at the Chrysler Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. In Europe, this car became known as Chrysler Stratus, where a 2.0-liter engine with a five-speed manual (A604) and a 2.5-liter V6 engine with a four-speed automatic were available as well.

==1996==
A modified version of the JA platform called JX debuted in 1995 as the Chrysler Sebring convertible. Changes for the JX included shortening the wheelbase to , removing the back doors and roof, stiffening the chassis to compensate for the loss of a solid top, and lengthening of the front and rear clips. The JX also had larger rear brake drums, ceramic brake pads, and a cooler thermostat to compensate for the increased weight of the reinforcements to the unibody. The available engines and transmissions are identical to that of the Chrysler Cirrus. Unlike the sedans, the convertibles were assembled in Mexico.

==2001==
The platform was updated in 2000, becoming JR. The Dodge Stratus name was carried over, and the Cirrus became the Chrysler Sebring sedan. The Chrysler Sebring convertible was built on the JR platform as well. The Breeze name was dropped (with the rest of Plymouth).

Engines available were the 2.4 L I4 and the 2.7 L LH V6. The wheelbase remained unchanged, although the track was increased slightly.

The JR sedans were built at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant, and the convertible moved back there from Mexico. The tooling from Sterling Heights Assembly was sold to Russian-based GAZ in 2006. GAZ intends to move the whole production line to a plant in Russia to build licensed JR sedans under a different nameGAZ Sibera facelifted Chrysler Sebring of the first generation. 

The vehicle nameplates were shuffled with the Diamond Star Motors (DSM) coupes. The first generation of the Avenger became the Stratus coupe, and the newly renamed Chrysler Sebring sedan now shared a name with the second generation Sebring coupe. Both of the coupes were based on the third generation Mitsubishi Eclipse and built alongside the Eclipse. They had nothing in common with the JR platform other than the names.

<doc id="873184" wikidata="Q3148886" url="?curid=873184" title="Holy card">
<text>In the Christian tradition, holy cards or prayer cards are small, devotional pictures for the use of the faithful that usually depict a religious scene or a saint in an image about the size of a playing card. The reverse typically contains a prayer, some of which promise an indulgence for its recitation.

The circulation of these cards is an important part of the visual folk culture of Roman Catholics, and in modern times, prayer cards have also become popular among Orthodox Christians and Protestant Christians, although with the latter, biblical themes are emphasized within them.

==Uses==

Most cards are circulated to assist the veneration of the saints and images they bear.

Special holy cards are printed for Catholics to be distributed at funerals by the family of the deceased that include the name and usually dates of birth and death of the deceased. These are a particular type of the in memoriam cards, which can also record other events such as baptisms, confirmations, ordinations, or the making of religious vows.

At the end of the nineteenth century, some Protestants also produced similar images of their own. They produced &quot;Bible cards&quot; or &quot;Sunday school cards&quot;, with lithographed illustrations depicting Bible stories and parables, more modern scenes of religious life or prayer, or sometimes just a Biblical text illuminated by calligraphy; these were linked to Biblical passages that related to the image. The reverse typically held a sermonette instead of a prayer. Imagery here was always the servant of text, and as such these Protestant cards tended to be replaced by tracts that emphasized message instead of imagery, and were illustrated with cartoon-like images if they were illustrated at all.

Old master prints, nearly all on religious subjects, served many of the same functions as holy cards, especially the cheaper woodcuts; the earliest dated surviving example is from 1423, probably from southern Germany, and depicts Saint Christopher, with handcolouring, it is found as part of the binding of a manuscript of the &quot;Laus Virginis&quot; (1417) which belongs to the John Rylands Library, Manchester.

Later engraving or etching were more commonly used. Some had elaborate borders of paper lace surrounding the images; these were called &quot;dévotes dentelles&quot; in France.

One use of such cards is illustrated in an early 15th-c painting of the Annunciation by Robert Campin, which stages the event in a bourgeois home; above the fireplace, a print of Christopher carrying the Christ child is tacked to the wall, possibly as a more affordable alternative to a painting.

=== Lithography ===
The invention of chromolithography made it possible to reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of the cards. An early centre of their manufacture was in the environs of the Church of St Sulpice in Paris; the lithographed images made there were done in delicate pastel colours, and proved extremely influential on later designs.

Belgium and Germany also became centres of the manufacture of holy cards, as did Italy in the twentieth century. Catholic printing houses (such as Maison de la Bonne Presse in France and Ars Sacra in Germany) produced large numbers of cards, and often a single design was printed by different companies in different countries.

=== Recent history ===
The 1940 &quot;Head of Christ&quot; painting has been printed more than 500 million times, including pocket-sized cards for carrying in a wallet. In the World War II era, &quot;millions of cards featuring the Head of Christ were distributed through the USO by the Salvation Army and the YMCA to members of the American armed forces stationed overseas&quot;.

During the Cold War, both Catholics and Protestants helped to popularize these cards, presenting &quot;a united front against the menace of godless Communism&quot;.

==Collecting==
Holy cards are popular collectible items. They are small and inexpensive and can be stored safely in plastic sleeves in a binder. Holy card collecting is mostly popular in Catholic countries. Collectors base their collection on various criteria like a favorite saint, country of issue, issuer, etc.

<text>A qadi (; ) is the magistrate or judge of a Sharia court, who also exercises extrajudicial functions such as mediation, guardianship over orphans and minors, and supervision and audition of public works.

==History==
The term &quot; was in use from the time of Muhammad during the early history of Islam, and remained the term used for judges throughout Islamic history and the period of the caliphates. While the and played the role in elucidation of the principles of Islamic jurisprudence () and the Islamic law (), the qadi remained the key person ensuring the establishment of justice on the basis of these very laws and rules. Thus, the qadi was chosen from amongst those who had mastered the sciences of jurisprudence and law. The office of qadi continued to be a very important one in every principality of the caliphates and sultanates of the various Muslim empires over the centuries. The rulers appointed a qadi in every region, town, and village for judicial and administrative control, and in order to establish peace and justice over the dominions they controlled. Although the primary responsibility of a qadi was judicial, he was generally charged with certain nonjudicial responsibilities as well, such as the administration of religious endowments (), the legitimization of the accession or deposition of a ruler, the execution of wills, the accreditation of witnesses, guardianship over orphans and others in need of protection, and supervision of the enforcement of public morals ().

The Abbasid caliphs created the office of chief qadi ( or ), whose holder acted primarily as adviser to the caliph in the appointment and dismissal of qadis. Among the most famous of the early judges appointed to the role of chief qadi was Abu Yusuf, a disciple of the early Muslim scholar and jurist Abu Hanifa an-Nu&#x27;man, founder of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence. Later Islamic states generally retained this office, while granting to its holder the authority to issue appointments and dismissals in his own name. The Mamluk Sultanate, which ruled Egypt and Syria from 1250 to 1516 CE, introduced the practice of appointing four chief qadis, one for each of the Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence ().

==Functions==
A qadi is a judge responsible for the application of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). The office originated under the rule of the first Umayyad caliphs (AH 40–85/661–705 CE), when the provincial governors of the newly created Islamic empire, unable to adjudicate the many disputes that arose among Muslims living within their territories, began to delegate this function to others. In this early period of Islamic history, no body of Islamic positive law had yet come into existence, and the first qadis therefore decided cases on the basis of the only guidelines available to them: Arab customary law, the laws of the conquered territories, the general precepts of the Qurʾān and their own sense of equity.

During the later Umayyad period (705–750 CE), a growing class of Muslim legal scholars (distinct from the qadis) busied themselves with the task of supplying the needed body of law, and by the time of the accession to power of the Abbasid dynasty in 750, their work could be said to have been essentially completed. In constructing their legal doctrine, the legal scholars took as their point of departure the precedents that had been established by the qadis, some of which they rejected as inconsistent with Islamic principles as these were coming to be understood but most of which they adopted, with or without modification. Thus the first qadis in effect laid the foundations of Islamic positive law.

Once that law had been formed, however, the role of the qadi underwent a profound change. No longer free to follow the guidelines mentioned above, a qadi was now expected to adhere solely to the new Islamic law, and that adherence has characterized the office ever since.

A qadi continued, however, to be a delegate of a higher authority, ultimately the caliph or, after the demise of the caliphate, the supreme ruler in a given territory. This delegate status implies the absence of a separation of powers; both judicial and executive powers were concentrated in the person of the supreme ruler (caliph or otherwise). On the other hand, a certain degree of autonomy was enjoyed by a qadi in that the law that he applied was not the creation of the supreme ruler or the expression of his will. What a qadi owed to the supreme ruler was solely the power to apply the law for which sanctions were necessary that only the supreme ruler as head of the state could guarantee.

==Qadi versus mufti==
Similar to a qadi, a mufti is also an interpreting power of Sharia. Muftis are jurists that give authoritative legal opinions, or &quot;fatwas&quot;, and historically have been known to rank above qadis. With the introduction of the secular court system in the 19th century, Ottoman councils began to enforce criminal legislation to emphasize their position as part of the new executive. That creation of the hierarchical secular judiciary did not displace the original Sharia courts.

Sharia justice developed along lines comparable to what happened to the organization of secular justice: greater bureaucratization, more precise legal circumscription of jurisdiction, and the creation of a hierarchy. This development began in 1856.

Until the Qadi&#x27;s Ordinance of 1856, the qadis were appointed by the Porte and were part of the Ottoman religious judiciary. This Ordinance recommends the consultation of muftis and the &quot;″ulama&quot;. In practice, the sentences of qadis usually were checked by muftis appointed to the courts. Other important decisions were also checked by the mufti of the Majlis al-Ahkam or by a council of &quot;ulama&quot; connected with it. It is said that if the local qadi and mufti disagreed, it became customary to submit the case to the authoritative Grand Mufti.

Later, in 1880, the new Sharia Courts Ordinance introduced the hierarchical judiciary. Through the Ministry of Justice, parties could appeal to the Cairo Sharia Court against decisions of provincial qadis and ni&#x27;ibs. There, parties could appeal to the Sharia Court open to the Shaykh al-Azhar and the Grand Mufti, and other people could be added.

Lastly, judges were to consult the muftis appointed to their courts whenever a case was not totally clear to them. If the problem was not solved, the case had to be submitted to the Grand Mufti, whose fatwa was binding on the qadi.

==Qualifications==

A qadi must (per the cited source) be a male adult, free, a Muslim, sane, unconvicted of slander and educated in Islamic science. His performance must be totally congruent with &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law) without using his own interpretation. In a trial in front of a qadi, it is the plaintiff who is responsible for bringing evidence against the defendant to have him or her convicted. There are no appeals to the judgements of a qadi. A qadi must exercise his office in a public place, the chief mosque is recommended, or, in his own house, where the public should have free access. The qadi had authority over a territory whose diameter was equivalent to a day&#x27;s walk. The opening of a trial theoretically required the presence of both the plaintiff and the defendant. If a plaintiff&#x27;s adversary resided in another judicial district, the plaintiff could present his evidence before the qadi of his own district, who would then write to the judge of the district in which the defendant resided and expose the evidence against him. The addressee qadi summoned the defendant and convicted him on that basis. Qadis kept court records in their archives (&quot;diwan&quot;) and handed them over to their successors once they had been dismissed.
Qadis must not receive gifts from participants in trials and must be careful in engaging themselves in trade. Despite the rules governing the office, Muslim history is full of complaints about qadis. It has often been a problem that qadis have been managers of waqfs, religious endowments.

The qualifications that a qadi must possess are stated in the law, but the law is not uniform on this subject. The minimal requirement upon which all the jurists agree is that a qadi possess the same qualifications as a witness in court: being be free, sane, adult, trustworthy, and a Muslim. Some require that they also possess the qualifications of a jurist, that is, that they be well versed in the law, bur others regard those qualifications as simply preferable and imply that a person may effectively discharge the duties of the office without being well versed in the law. The latter position presupposed that a qadi who is not learned in matters of law would consult those who are before reaching a decision. Indeed, consultation was urged upon the learned qadi as well since even the learned are fallible and can profit from the views of others. Those consulted did not, however, have a voice in the final decision-making. The Islamic court was a strictly one-judge court, and the final decision rested upon the shoulders of a single qadi.

==Jurisdiction==

The jurisdiction of a qadi was theoretically coextensive with the scope of the law that he applied. That law was fundamentally a law for Muslims, and the internal affairs of the non-Muslim, or &quot;dhimmī&quot;s, communities living within the Islamic state were left under the jurisdictions of those communities. Islamic law governed &quot;dhimmī&quot;s only with respect to their relations to Muslims and to the Islamic state. In actual practice, however, the jurisdiction of a qadi was hemmed in by what must be regarded as rival jurisdictions, particularly that of the &quot;maẓālim&quot; court and that of the shurṭah.

The &quot;maẓālim&quot; was a court (presided over by the supreme ruler himself or his governor) that heard complaints addressed to it by virtually any offended party. Since Islamic law did not provide for any appellate jurisdiction but regarded the decision of a qadi as final and irrevocable, the &quot;maẓālim&quot; court could function as a kind of court of appeals in cases that parties complained of unfair decisions from qadis. The &quot;maẓālim&quot; judge was not bound to the rules of Islamic law (&quot;fiqh&quot;) or, for that matter, to any body of positive law, but he was free to make decisions entirely on the basis of considerations of equity. The &quot;maẓālim&quot; court thus provided a remedy for the inability of a qadi to take equity freely into account. It also made up for certain shortcomings of Islamic law, for example, the lack of a highly developed law of torts, which was largely because of the preoccupation of the law with breaches of contracts. In addition, it heard complaints against state officials.

The &quot;shurṭah&quot;, on the other hand, was the state apparatus responsible for criminal justice. It too provided a remedy for a deficiency in the law, namely the incompleteness and procedural rigidity of its criminal code. Although in theory a qadi exercised a criminal jurisdiction, in practice, that jurisdiction was removed from his sphere of competence and turned over entirely to the &quot;shurṭah&quot;, which developed its own penalties and procedures. What was left to the qadi was a jurisdiction concerned mainly with cases having to do with inheritance, personal status, property, and commercial transactions. Even within that jurisdiction, a particular qadi&#x27;s jurisdiction could be further restricted to particular cases or types of cases at the behest of the appointing superior.

The principle of delegation of judicial powers not only allowed the supreme ruler to delegate those powers to a qadi but also allowed qadis to further delegate them to others, and there was, in principle, no limit to that chain of delegation. All persons in the chain, except for the supreme ruler or his governor, bore the title qadi. Although in theory, the appointment of a qadi could be effected by a simple verbal declaration on the part of the appointing superior, it was normally accomplished by means of a written certificate of investiture, which obviated the need for the appointee to appear in the presence of the superior. The appointment was essentially unilateral, rather than contractual, and did not require acceptance on the part of the appointee to be effective. It could be revoked at any time.

==Jewish use==
The Jews living in the Ottoman Empire sometimes used qadi courts to settle disputes. Under the Ottoman system, Jews throughout the Empire retained the formal right to oversee their own courts and apply their own religious law. The motivation for bringing Jewish cases to qadi courts varied. In sixteenth-century Jerusalem, Jews preserved their own courts and maintained relative autonomy. Rabbi Samuel De Medina and other prominent rabbis repeatedly warned co-religionists that it was forbidden to bring cases to government courts and that doing so undermined Jewish legal authority, which could be superseded only &quot;in matters that pertained to taxation, commercial transactions, and contracts&quot;.

Throughout the century, Jewish litigants and witnesses participated in Muslim court proceedings when it was expedient, or when cited to do so. Jews who wanted to bring cases against Muslims had to do so in qadi courts, where they found a surprising objectivity. But the different legal status of Jews and Muslims was preserved.

==In Sri Lanka==
In accordance with section 12 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, the Judicial Services Commission may appoint any male Muslim of good character and position and of suitable attainments to be a Quazi. The Quazi does not have a permanent courthouse, thus the word &quot;Quazi Court&quot; is not applicable in the current context. The Quazi can hear the cases anywhere and anytime he wants. Currently most Quazis are laymen.

In accordance with section 15 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, the Judicial Services Commission may appoint a Board of Quazis, consisting of five male Muslims resident in Sri Lanka, who are of good character and position and of suitable attainments, to hear appeals from the decisions of the Quazis under this Act. The Board of Quazis does not have a permanent courthouse either. Usually an appeal or a revision takes a minimum of two to three years in order to arrive for judgment from the Board of Quazis. The Board of Quazis can start the proceedings at whatever time they want and end the proceedings at whatever time they want. The Office of the Board of Quazis is situated in Hulftsdorp, Colombo 12.

==Muslim female judges==

===Post-colonialism and female judges===
As Muslim states gained independence from Europe, a vacuum was intentionally left by the colonizing powers in various sectors of education and government. European colonizers were careful to exclude &quot;natives&quot; from access to legal education and legal professions. Thus, the number of law graduates and legal professionals was inadequate, and women were needed to fill the empty spaces in the judiciaries. Rulers reacted by expanding general educational opportunities for women to fill positions in the expanding state bureaucracy, and in the 1950s and 1960s began the first phase of women being appointed as judges. Such was the case in 1950s Indonesia, which has the largest number of female judges in the Muslim world.

In some countries, the colonized had more opportunities to study law, such as in Egypt. Sufficient male students to study law and fill legal positions and other bureaucratic jobs in the postcolonial state may have delayed women&#x27;s acceptance into judicial positions.

In comparison, a similar situation happened in Europe and America. After World War II, a shortage of judges in Europe paved the way for European women to enter legal professions and work as judges. American women in World War II also entered the workforce in unprecedented numbers due to the dire need.

===Contemporary female judges in Muslim states===

Although the role of qadi has traditionally been restricted to men, women now serve as qadis in many countries, including Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Malaysia, Palestine, Tunisia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates. In 2009, two women were appointed as qadis by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. In 2010, Malaysia appointed two women as qadis as well. However, it was decided that as women they may only rule over custody, alimony, and common property issues, not over criminal or divorce cases, which usually make up most of a qadi&#x27;s work. In Indonesia, there are nearly 100 female qadis. In 2017, Hana Khatib was appointed as the first female qadi in Israel.

In Morocco, a researcher found that female judges were more sensitive to the interests of female litigants in alimony cases and held similar views to their male colleagues in maintaining Sharia standards such as the need for a &quot;wali&quot; (male guardian) for marriage.

===Scholarly debate===

There is disagreement among Islamic scholars as to whether women are qualified to act as qadis or not. Many modern Muslim states have a combination of religious and secular courts. The secular courts often have little issue with female judges, but the religious courts may restrict what domains female judges can preside in, such as only family and marital law.

==Local usage==

===Indian subcontinent===
Islamic rulers in the subcontinent also used the same institution of the qadi (or qazi). The qadi was given the responsibility for total administrative, judicial and fiscal control over a territory or a town. He would maintain all the civil records as well. He would also retain a small army or force to ensure that his rulings are enforced.

In most cases, the qazi would pass on the title and position to his son, descendant or a very close relative. Over the centuries, this profession became a title within the families, and the power remained within one family in a region. Throughout Muslim Regions, we now find various Qazi families who descended through their famous Qazi (Qadi) ancestors and retained the lands and position. Each family is known by the town or city that their ancestors controlled.

Qazis are mostly found in areas of Pakistan, specifically in Sindh as well as India. They are now also prominent in small areas of Australia.

===Matinik Island===
The grand qadi of Martinique manages the mosque projects and has a role of social mediator, agents of Muslim justice.

===Mayotte governorship===
On the island of Mayotte, one of the Comoro Islands, the title &quot;qadi&quot; was used for Umar who governed it from 19 November 1835 to 1836 after its conquest by and annexation to the Sultanate of Ndzuwani (Anjouan).

===Songhai Empire===
In the Songhai Empire, criminal justice was based mainly, if not entirely, on Islamic principles, especially during the rule of Askia Muhammad. The local qadis were responsible for maintaining order by following &quot;Sharia&quot; law according to the Qur&#x27;an. An additional &quot;qadi&quot; was noted as a necessity in order to settle minor disputes between immigrant merchants. &quot;Qadis&quot; worked at the local level and were positioned in important trading towns, such as Timbuktu and Djenné. The Qadi was appointed by the king and dealt with common-law misdemeanors according to Sharia law. The Qadi also had the power to grant a pardon or offer refuge.

===Spanish derivation===
&quot;Alcalde&quot;, one of the current Spanish terms for the mayor of a town or city, is derived from the Arabic &quot;al-qaḍi&quot; ( القاضي), &quot;the judge&quot;. In Al-Andalus a single qadi was appointed to each province. To deal with issues that fell outside of the purview of sharia or to handle municipal administration (such as oversight of the police and the markets) other judicial officers with different titles were appointed by the rulers.

The term was later adopted in Portugal, Leon and Castile during the eleventh and twelfth centuries to refer to the assistant judges, who served under the principal municipal judge, the &quot;iudex&quot; or &quot;juez&quot;. Unlike the appointed Andalusian &quot;qadis&quot;, the &quot;alcaldes&quot; were elected by an assembly of the municipality&#x27;s property owners. Eventually the term came to be applied to a host of positions that combined administrative and judicial functions, such as the &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot;, the &quot;alcaldes del crimen&quot; and the &quot;alcaldes de barrio&quot;. The adoption of this term, like many other Arabic ones, reflects the fact that, at least in the early phases of the Reconquista, Muslim society in the Iberian Peninsula imparted great influence on the Christian one. As Spanish Christians took over an increasing part of the Peninsula, they adapted Muslim systems and terminology for their own use.

===Ottoman Empire===
In the Ottoman Empire, qadis were appointed by the &quot;Veliyu l-Emr&quot;. With the reform movements, secular courts have replaced qadis, but they formerly held wide-ranging responsibilities:
:... During Ottoman period, [qadi] was responsible for the city services. The charged people such as Subasi, Bocekbasi, Copluk Subasisi, Mimarbasi and Police assisted the qadi, who coordinated all the services.&quot; [From History of Istanbul Municipality, Istanbul Municipality (in Turkish).]
The role of the Qadi in the Ottoman legal system changed as the Empire progressed through history. The 19th century brought a great deal of political and legal reform to the Ottoman Empire in an effort to modernize the nation in the face of a shifting power balance in Europe and the interventions in Ottoman territories that followed. In territories such as the Khedivate of Egypt, attempts were made at merging the existing Hanafi system with French-influenced secular laws in an attempt to reduce the influence of local Qadis and their rulings. Such efforts were met with mixed success as the Ottoman-drafted reforms often still left fields such as civil law open to a Qadi&#x27;s rulings based on the previously used Hanafi systems in sharia-influenced courts.

In the Ottoman Empire, a Kadiluk – the district covered by a kadı – was an administrative subdivision, smaller than a Sanjak.
====Expansion of the use of qadis====
As the Empire expanded, so did the legal complexities that were built into the system of administration carried over and were enhanced by the conditions of frontier expansion. In particular, the Islamic empire adapted legal devices to deal with the existence of large populations of non-Muslims, a persistent feature of empire despite incentives for conversion and in part because of institutional protections for communal legal forums. These aspects of the Islamic legal order would have been quite familiar to travelers from other parts of the world. Indeed, Jewish, Armenian, and Christian traders found institutional continuity across Islamic and Western regions, negotiating for and adopting strategies to enhance this resemblance.

<text>}}

The Hale Telescope is a , 3.3 reflecting telescope at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, US, named after astronomer George Ellery Hale. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1928, he orchestrated the planning, design, and construction of the observatory, but with the project ending up taking 20 years he did not live to see its commissioning. The Hale was groundbreaking for its time, with double the diameter of the second-largest telescope, and pioneered many new technologies in telescope mount design and in the design and fabrication of its large aluminum coated &quot;honeycomb&quot; low thermal expansion Pyrex mirror. It was completed in 1949 and is still in active use.

The Hale Telescope represented the technological limit in building large optical telescopes for over 30 years. It was the largest telescope in the world from its construction in 1949 until the Soviet BTA-6 was built in 1976, and the second largest until the construction of the Keck Observatory Keck 1 in Hawaii in 1993.

== History ==

Hale supervised the building of the telescopes at the Mount Wilson Observatory with grants from the Carnegie Institution of Washington: the telescope in 1908 and the telescope in 1917. These telescopes were very successful, leading to the rapid advance in understanding of the scale of the Universe through the 1920s, and demonstrating to visionaries like Hale the need for even larger collectors.

The chief optical designer for Hale&#x27;s previous 100-inch telescope was George Willis Ritchey, who intended the new telescope to be of Ritchey–Chrétien design. Compared to the usual parabolic primary, this design would have provided sharper images over a larger usable field of view. However, Ritchey and Hale had a falling-out. With the project already late and over budget, Hale refused to adopt the new design, with its complex curvatures, and Ritchey left the project. The Mount Palomar Hale Telescope turned out to be the last world-leading telescope to have a parabolic primary mirror.

In 1928 Hale secured a grant of $6 million from the Rockefeller Foundation for &quot;the construction of an observatory, including a 200-inch reflecting telescope&quot; to be administered by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), of which Hale was a founding member. In the early 1930s, Hale selected a site at on Palomar Mountain in San Diego County, California, US, as the best site, and less likely to be affected by the growing light pollution problem in urban centers like Los Angeles. The Corning Glass Works was assigned the task of making a primary mirror. Construction of the observatory facilities and dome started in 1936, but because of interruptions caused by World War II, the telescope was not completed until 1948 when it was dedicated. Due to slight distortions of images, corrections were made to the telescope throughout 1949. It became available for research in 1950.

Postage Stamp. The US Post Office issued a 3c postage stamp in 1948 commemorating the Hale Telescope and Observatory.

A functioning one-tenth scale model of the telescope was also made at Corning.

The telescope saw first light on January 26, 1949, at 10:06pm PST under the direction of American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble, targeting NGC 2261, an object also known as Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula. 

The telescope continues to be used every clear night for scientific research by astronomers from Caltech and their operating partners, Cornell University, the University of California, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is equipped with modern optical and infrared array imagers, spectrographs, and an adaptive optics system. It has also used lucky cam imaging, which in combination with adaptive optics pushed the mirror close to its theoretical resolution for certain types of viewing.

One of the Corning Labs&#x27; glass test blanks for the Hale was used for the C. Donald Shane telescope&#x27;s primary mirror.

The collecting area of the mirror is about 31,000 square inches (20 square meters).

== Components ==

=== Mounting structures ===

The Hale Telescope uses a special type of equatorial mount called a &quot;horseshoe mount&quot;, a modified yoke mount that replaces the polar bearing with an open &quot;horseshoe&quot; structure that gives the telescope full access to the entire sky, including Polaris and stars near it. The optical tube assembly (OTA) uses a Serrurier truss, then newly invented by Mark U. Serrurier of Caltech in Pasadena in 1935, designed to flex in such a way as to keep all of the optics in alignment. 

=== 200-inch mirror ===
Originally, the Hale Telescope was going to use a primary mirror of fused quartz manufactured by General Electric, but instead the primary mirror was cast in 1934 at Corning Glass Works in New York state using Corning&#x27;s then new material called Pyrex (borosilicate glass). 


The mirror was cast in a mold with 36 raised mold blocks (similar in shape to a waffle iron). This created a honeycomb mirror that cut the amount of Pyrex needed down from over to just , making a mirror that would cool faster in use and have multiple &quot;mounting points&quot; on the back to evenly distribute its weight (note – see external links 1934 article for drawings). The shape of a central hole was also part of the mold so light could pass through the finished mirror when it was used in a Cassegrain configuration (a Pyrex plug for this hole was also made to be used during the grinding and polishing process). While the glass was being poured into the mold during the first attempt to cast the 200-inch mirror, the intense heat caused several of the molding blocks to break loose and float to the top, ruining the mirror. The defective mirror was used to test the annealing process. After the mold was re-engineered, a second mirror was successfully cast.

After cooling several months, the finished mirror blank was transported by rail to Pasadena, California. Once in Pasadena the mirror was transferred from the rail flat car to a specially designed semi-trailer for road transport to where it would be polished. In the optical shop in Pasadena (now the Synchrotron building at Caltech) standard telescope mirror making techniques were used to turn the flat blank into a precise concave parabolic shape, although they had to be executed on a grand scale. A special &quot;mirror cell&quot; jig was constructed which could employ five different motions when the mirror was ground and polished. Over 13 years almost of glass was ground and polished away, reducing the weight of the mirror to . The mirror was coated (and still is re-coated every 18–24 months) with a reflective aluminum surface using the same aluminum vacuum-deposition process invented in 1930 by Caltech physicist and astronomer John Strong.

The Hale&#x27;s mirror was near the technological limit of a primary mirror made of a single rigid piece of glass. Using a monolithic mirror much larger than the 5-meter Hale or 6-meter BTA-6 is prohibitively expensive due to the cost of both the mirror, and the massive structure needed to support it. A mirror beyond that size would also sag slightly under its own weight as the telescope is rotated to different positions, changing the precision shape of the surface, which must be accurate to within 2 millionths of an inch (50 nm). Modern telescopes over 9 meters use a different mirror design to solve this problem, with either a single thin flexible mirror or a cluster of smaller segmented mirrors, whose shape is continuously adjusted by a computer-controlled active optics system using actuators built into the mirror support cell.

===Dome===
The moving weight of the upper dome is about 1000 US tons, and can rotate on wheels. The dome doors weigh 125 tons each. The dome is made of welded steel plates about 10 mm thick.

==Observations and research==

The first observation of the Hale Telescope was of NGC 2261 on January 26, 1949.

During its first 50 years, the Hale Telescope made many significant contributions to stellar evolution, cosmology, and high-energy astrophysics. Similarly, the telescope, and the technology developed for it, advanced the study of the spectra of stars, interstellar matter, AGNs, and quasars.

Quasars were first identified as high redshift sources by spectra taken with the Hale Telescope.

Halley&#x27;s Comet (1P) upcoming 1986 approach to the Sun was first detected by astronomers David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 200-inch Hale Telescope equipped with a CCD camera.

Two moons of the planet Uranus were discovered in September 1997, bringing the planet&#x27;s total known moons to 17 at that time. One was Caliban (S/1997 U 1), which was discovered on 6 September 1997 by Brett J. Gladman, Philip D. Nicholson, Joseph A. Burns, and John J. Kavelaars using the 200-inch Hale Telescope. The other Uranian moon discovered then is Sycorax (initial designation S/1997 U 2) and was also discovered using the 200 inch Hale Telescope.

The &quot;Cornell Mid-Infrared Asteroid Spectroscopy&quot; (MIDAS) survey used the Hale Telescope with a spectrograph to study spectra from 29 asteroids.

In 2009, using a coronograph, the Hale Telescope was used to discover the star Alcor B, which is a companion to Alcor in the Big Dipper.

In 2010, a new satellite of planet Jupiter was discovered with the 200-inch Hale, called S/2010 J 1 and later named Jupiter LI.

In October 2017 the Hale Telescope was able to record the spectrum of the first recognized interstellar object, 1I/2017 U1 (&quot;ʻOumuamua&quot;); while no specific mineral was identified it showed the visitor had a reddish surface color.

In December 2023 the Hale Telescope began serving as the receiving antenna for the Deep Space Optical Communications experiment on NASA&#x27;s Psyche mission.

=== Direct imaging of exoplanets ===

Up until the year 2010, telescopes could only directly image exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, it is easier to obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated that a vortex coronagraph could enable small scopes to directly image planets.

== Comparison ==

The Hale had four times the light-collecting area of the second-largest scope when it was commissioned in 1949. Other contemporary telescopes were the Hooker Telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory and the Otto Struve Telescope at the McDonald Observatory.

<doc id="873198" wikidata="Q1364244" url="?curid=873198" title="Alcazar (group)">
<text>Alcazar is a Swedish nu-disco group formed in Stockholm. The group is one of Sweden&#x27;s most successful music acts, both nationally and internationally, achieving a series of hits since their debut single in 1999. Globally, Alcazar sold over 12 million records between 2001 and 2004. The group gained international recognition in 2000 with their song &quot;Crying at the Discoteque,&quot; which charted in the USA, Brazil, Australia, Japan, and most European countries.

Alcazar disbanded in August 2011 after a concert at Stockholm Pride. They reunited in 2013 ahead of Melodifestivalen 2014 before disbanding again in 2018. Since then, they have only reunited on rare occasions.

==Band career==
The group formed in 1998 with three members: Andreas Lundstedt, Tess Merkel, and Annika &quot;Annikafiore&quot; Kjærgaard (). Their first single, &quot;Shine On,&quot; was a hit in Sweden, but it was with their second release, &quot;Crying at the Discoteque&quot; (which heavily sampled Sheila and B. Devotion&#x27;s 1979 hit &quot;Spacer&quot;), that they achieved success across Europe.

Both singles appeared on their album, &quot;Casino&quot;, which was written and produced by fellow Swedes Alexander Bard and Anders Hansson.

Later editions of &quot;Casino&quot; contain a cover of The Human League&#x27;s hit &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me,&quot; which also served as the third single from the album. In the United States, Alcazar gained moderate success. &quot;Crying at the Discoteque&quot; peaked at No. 44, and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; reached No. 30 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play.

In December 2002, Lundstedt&#x27;s boyfriend at the time, Magnus Carlsson, joined the group. Their second album, &quot;Alcazarized&quot;, was released in Sweden in 2003 and became a big hit. It was released internationally in 2004 with new cover artwork and a slightly different track list. In September 2004, Alcazar released &quot;This Is the World We Live In.&quot; The song samples Diana Ross&#x27;s 1980 hit single &quot;Upside Down&quot; and reuses the lyrics and melody from Genesis&#x27; 1986 single &quot;Land of Confusion.&quot;

Their follow-up single, &quot;Physical,&quot; also sampled an older hit: Londonbeat&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking About You.&quot; The singles were followed by the album &quot;Dancefloor Deluxe&quot;, which was released in Sweden in August 2004. In the winter of 2004/2005, they released the Christmas single &quot;Here I Am.&quot; Alcazar enjoyed considerable success in 2004 in their home country, Sweden.

In 2005, the single &quot;Start the Fire&quot; was released. During the filming of its music video, Kjærgaard had an accident in which she broke her foot.

In the autumn of 2005, the band decided to take a break. Lundstedt pursued musicals and took on the lead role in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, while Tess became a professional poker player.

In May 2007, the band performed in London at the nightclub G-A-Y, alongside Swedish colleagues BWO and Army of Lovers, with their friend Lina Hedlund joining them on stage. This collaboration was highly successful, and a few months later, the &quot;New Alcazar&quot; was formed.

In January 2008, their comeback single &quot;We Keep on Rockin&#x27;&quot;, written and produced by Anders Hansson, was released. The single quickly became a hit, and just a week after its release, it achieved gold status in sales. In March 2009, their new album, &quot;Disco Defenders&quot;, was released in Sweden. The album consists of two discs. Disc one features 12 brand new tracks, including &quot;We Keep on Rockin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Burning&quot;, &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, and &quot;Stay the Night&quot;. Disc two includes 11 of their greatest hits, such as &quot;Crying at the Discoteque&quot;, &quot;This Is the World We Live In&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;. &quot;Disco Defenders&quot; received positive reviews from Swedish critics.

In 2010, Alcazar recorded a duet with British pop group Same Difference, titled &quot;Karma Karma&quot;. It was included on Same Difference&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Rest Is History&quot;. Although not officially released as a single, the song charted on Swedish iTunes due to Alcazar&#x27;s popularity in their home country.

Alcazar is also working on their fourth studio album. The follow-up to 2009&#x27;s &quot;Disco Defenders&quot; will feature songwriting by German newcomer Victor Finke. The new single &quot;Good Lovin&quot; was released in August 2014.

The band reunited again to perform at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Malmö as an interval act in the final.

==Melodifestivalen==
Alcazar has participated in Melodifestivalen, the annual competition that selects Sweden&#x27;s entries for the Eurovision Song Contest, on five occasions. In 2003, their song &quot;Not a Sinner, Nor a Saint&quot; initially failed to qualify for the final but received a wildcard in the second chance round, ultimately finishing 3rd overall. Despite not winning, the song became the biggest hit among all the participating entries in Melodifestivalen 2003. It was Alcazar&#x27;s first number-one single in Sweden and was certified Gold.

In early 2005, Alcazar was offered a spot in the United Kingdom&#x27;s national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 but declined the offer. Instead, they entered Melodifestivalen 2005 with the disco track &quot;Alcastar.&quot; As in 2003, they initially failed to qualify for the final but advanced through the second chance semi-final. Once again, the group finished in 3rd place in the final, which was won by Martin Stenmarck&#x27;s song &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Alcastar&quot; became a hit, reaching number one in Sweden and marking Alcazar&#x27;s second chart-topping single.
Alcazar participated in Melodifestivalen 2009 with the song &quot;Stay the Night&quot;. After performing during the first semifinal at Scandinavium in Gothenburg, they finished in the top two for the first time, qualifying directly for the final. In the final held at Globen, Alcazar placed third with the regional juries and fourth in the televote, ultimately finishing fifth overall. The song peaked at number two on the Swedish Singles Chart, marking another Top 10 single for Alcazar in Sweden. The group also participated in Melodifestivalen 2010 with the song &quot;Headlines&quot;, written and produced by Tony Nilsson and Peter Boström. They made it to the second chance round but failed to reach the final.

On 23 February 2013, Alcazar reunited for a &quot;best of hits&quot; performance in Melodifestivalen 2013 in Malmö, joined by Swedish singer Danny Saucedo.

On 28 November 2013, it was announced that the band would compete for a fifth time in Melodifestivalen 2014 with the song &quot;Blame It on the Disco&quot;. They competed in the fourth semi-final and advanced to the final at Friends Arena on 8 March. They finished in third place once again.

On 1 May, it was revealed that Alcazar would serve as spokespersons, presenting the voting results for Sweden in the Eurovision 2014 final on 10 May.

==Break and line-up changes==

The band announced that they needed a break in March 2005. Lundstedt stated that the band would return in the summer of 2007. In the meantime, the male members pursued solo careers. Lundstedt participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 as a member of six4one, a multinational band formed specifically to represent Switzerland at the contest, while Carlsson took part individually in the Swedish Melodifestivalen on two occasions.

Lina Hedlund was announced as the replacement for Annikafiore. The band now includes Tess Merkel and Hedlund as female vocalists, with Lundstedt serving as the male vocalist.

==Performances==
Alcazar reformed in July 2007 to perform at the London Astoria as part of a celebration of Swedish music organized by producer Alexander Bard, known for his work with Army of Lovers. During the G-A-Y event on 21 July 2007, they performed alongside BWO and a reformed cult band, Army of Lovers. The set included three songs: &quot;This Is the World We Live In&quot;, &quot;Start the Fire&quot;, and &quot;Crying at the Discoteque&quot;. Despite the successful performance, Andreas Lundstedt did not confirm any plans for a full reunion, only suggesting future one-off appearances at G-A-Y events.

The band performed again on 5 July 2008 at G-A-Y Astoria for Pride London 2008, singing &quot;This Is the World We Live In&quot;, &quot;Sexual Guarantee/Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;, and &quot;Crying at the Discoteque&quot; after BWO. They concluded the performance with a cover of &quot;Funkytown&quot; by Lipps Inc., featuring BWO on stage. Alcazar also made an appearance on 28 June 2008 in Bologna for the Italian national Gay Pride parade. On 31 December 2008, they returned to G-A-Y at its new venue, Heaven.

All five members of the band reunited at EuroPride 2018. In 2020, Alcazar briefly reformed to perform at the Melodifestivalen 2020 Hall of Fame, which Lina hosted. Additionally, they reunited to perform as an interval act during the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024.

<text>The British Aerospace Jetstream 41 is a turboprop-powered feederliner and regional airliner, designed by British Aerospace as a stretched version of the popular Jetstream 31. Intended to compete directly with 30-seat aircraft like the Embraer Brasilia, Dornier 328 and Saab 340, the new design eventually accommodated 29 passengers in a two-by-one arrangement like the Jetstream 31. Eastern Airways of the UK is the biggest operator of Jetstream 41s in the world, with 14 in the fleet.

==Design and development==
The Jetstream 41&#x27;s stretch added to the fuselage, consisting of an plug forward of the wing and a plug to the rear; the fuselage design was all-new with no commonality with the old fuselage. The wing had increased span and redesigned ailerons and flaps. It was mounted below the fuselage, so the spar did not form a step in the cabin aisle. This also gave more baggage capacity in larger wing-root fairings.

The Allied Signal TPE331-14 engines deliver 1,500 shp (1,120 kW), (later 1,650 shp (1,232 kW)), and are mounted in nacelles with increased ground clearance. The flightdeck is improved with a modern EFIS setup, and a new windscreen arrangement. The J41 was the first turboprop certified to both JAR25 and FAR25 standards.

==Operational history==
The J41 flew for the first time on 25 September 1991 and was certified on 23 November 1992 in Europe, and 9 April 1993 in the United States, with the first delivery, to Manx Airlines on 25 November 1992. In January 1996, the J41 became part of the Aero International (Regional) (AI(R)), a marketing consortium consisting of ATR, Aérospatiale (of France), Alenia (of Italy), and British Aerospace. Sales initially were fairly strong, but in May 1997 BAe announced that it was terminating J41 production, with 100 aircraft delivered.

<doc id="873203" wikidata="Q255946" url="?curid=873203" title="Dodge Avenger">
<text>The Dodge Avenger is a front-wheel drive, mid-sized sedan that was marketed by Dodge. The Avenger made its North American debut in 1994 for the 1995 model year as a coupe that was produced until 2000. The model name was reintroduced to the market as a four-door sedan in 2007 for the 2008 model year. The Dodge Avenger name was used on the South African market Hillman Avengers in 1975 and 1976.

The 2014 model year marked the end of Avenger production as the mid-sized models for both the Dodge and Chrysler brands were consolidated into the new Chrysler 200 introduced for the 2015 model year while Dodge received the new compact Dart.

==Nameplate history==

The first use of the Dodge Avenger name was on a badge-engineered version of the European Hillman Avenger, exclusive to South Africa. The same car was sold in North America as the Plymouth Cricket between 1972 and 1974. In place of the Hillman engines, this version used a Peugeot 1.6 L engine (as also installed in locally assembled Peugeot 404s) to satisfy local content requirements. The Dodge-branded Avenger was introduced in 1975 and was then renamed Chrysler in 1976. This generation has nothing in common with later Dodge Avengers. After Chrysler ZA was merged into Sigma in 1976, the Avenger was soon canceled to allow Sigma to free up more production capacity for the Mazda 323.

The Avenger nameplate returned as a 2023 subcompact Jeep model available as a plug-in hybrid version or an all-electric drivetrain.
==Dodge Avenger Coupe (1995–2000)==
Introduced as a two-door coupe in North America, the Dodge Avenger was built from 1994 until 2000 in a similar size and price class as the Dodge Daytona, which was discontinued in February 1993.

The Avenger, along with the similar Chrysler Sebring coupe, was built by Diamond Star Motors (DSM), a joint venture between Chrysler Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors, on a version of the Mitsubishi Galant platform (which also spawned the similar Mitsubishi Eclipse). Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993. Diamond-Star Motors was renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995. Avengers and Sebring coupes built from 1994 until 1996 have DSM identification in their engine compartments.

The Avenger was built on a wheelbase and used either a 2.0 L inline-four engine (the Chrysler 420A) or a Mitsubishi-designed 2.5 L V6. The four-cylinder was coupled to a five-speed manual transmission, shared with the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talon, or a four-speed automatic. The V6 engine was only available with the A604 automatic transmission. The Avengers featured a fully independent double wishbone suspension and variable-speed rack-and-pinion steering.

Trims included the Highline base model (the V6 engine, among other options, were made standard in 2000) and the ES.

===Model year changes===
====1995====
A DOHC 16-valve 2.0 L I4 engine ( and of torque) is standard. A SOHC 24-valve 2.5 L V6 engine and an automatic transmission ( and of torque) are optional on the ES. Fog lamps and ABS are optional on the ES.

====1996====
* Power and torque ratings for the V6 are increased (163 horsepower, torque), and the ES coupes had new seat fabric
* OBD-II is standard
* New colors
* A universal garage door opener was added as an option

====1997====
Standard were 16-inch wheels, and the license plate was moved from the decklid to the rear bumper. The front and rear fasciae were redesigned. A Sport model was introduced (in addition to the base and ES). The Avenger Sport package consisted of exclusive 16-inch aluminum wheels and a body-color spoiler. This appearance package was available on the base model.

A body-color rear spoiler, P215/50HR17 tires, and 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels were added for the ES. The V6 is also standard for the ES, and rear disc brakes.

====1998====

An onboard recycling vapor recovery system, &quot;Cafe Latte&quot; exterior color, and a black and gray interior color combination are added.

====1999====
Next-generation driver and front passenger airbags are added, as well as a new exterior color: Shark Blue. The V6 engine and automatic transmission are standard on all models in mid-year, as well as several options. An antilock braking system (ABS) was used in all ES models until 1999.

====2000====
For the 2000 model year, the V6 and automatic transmission combination were standard on all Avengers, and ABS was an &quot;option&quot; for ES models. The four-cylinder engine was no longer available. Standard features that had previously been optional included power windows and locks. Base models added cruise control and four-wheel disc brakes. The ES coupes now come with standard leather upholstery, keyless remote entry, and a power driver&#x27;s seat.

===Replacement===
The coupe did not achieve high sales numbers, so in 2000, the Avenger was discontinued. It was replaced by the Dodge Stratus coupe for the 2001 model year. This coupe utilized the third-generation Eclipse platform and architecture. Mitsubishi assembled it at the former Diamond Star plant. However, the Stratus sedan was engineered and built by Chrysler.

==Dodge Avenger sedan (2007–2014)==
The Dodge Avenger nameplate returned in February 2007 as a 2008 model year sedan to replace the Dodge Stratus, whose coupe version had replaced the original Avenger in 2001.

Like its Dodge Journey stablemate, the Avenger&#x27;s exterior was styled by Chrysler&#x27;s Ryan Nagode. Ben S. Chang designed the interior.

The Avenger was officially unveiled as a concept car at the Paris Motor Show on 28 September 2006. It was launched in Europe and marketed in the United Kingdom, filling a gap in the Chrysler range left by the Neon&#x27;s discontinuation four years earlier. It was also launched in Australia with only the 2.4 L engine. The Avenger was discontinued in that market in 2010 due to slow sales. The 2007 through 2014 models were sold in New Zealand.

According to some reports, the Avenger and the redesigned Chrysler Sebring share a DaimlerChrysler/Mitsubishi Motors platform called JS, which used the Mitsubishi GS as a starting point. The SE and SXT trim levels&#x27; base engine was the 2.4 L GEMA I4 naturally aspirated &quot;World Engine&quot;, a joint venture between DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai. Additional engines included an optional 2.7 L V6 in the SXT and a standard 3.5 L V6 in the R/T trim level. In addition to the 2.4 L World Engine and the V6s, export vehicles were offered with the 2.0 L naturally aspirated World Engine, as well as a 2.0 L turbocharged diesel (Pumpe-Düse) made by Volkswagen.

===2008===
Although a 2008 model, the Dodge Avenger was available in February 2007. In the U.S. market, the Avenger was launched with a 30-second television advertisement, &quot;Tuned Up&quot;, that debuted on 4 March 2007, during NHL hockey, an ad in which a lab technician discovers he can play &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; by Deep Purple on the Avenger&#x27;s transmission. Another television spot likened the Avenger to the &quot;superhero&quot; vehicle for the everyman, depicting a driver piloting his Avenger through Gotham-like streets and alleys, speaking to the MyGig entertainment system in distinctly Batman-reminiscent tones, to arrive home, pull into a two-car garage, and open the rear door to a sleeping child in the rear car seat.

Features on the new Avenger included optional heated/cooled cup holders and Dodge&#x27;s new &quot;Chill Zone&quot;, a feature that comes standard on all Avenger models, which can store up to four 12-US-fl oz cans in the glove box and chill them to 40 °F.

The Avenger competed directly with the Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion, with the 2007 and later Chrysler Sebring being aimed at the higher-priced American cars such as the Mercury Milan, Pontiac G6, and Saturn Aura.

===2009===
For the 2009 model year, like its Caliber, Charger, Grand Caravan, Journey, and Nitro models, the &quot;AVENGER&quot; badge at the trunk lid&#x27;s left was repositioned to the right side to make way for &quot;DODGE&quot; at the left.

Following Fiat&#x27;s takeover of Chrysler Group, marketing of the Avenger was discontinued in the United Kingdom. Sales of the Avenger continued in the Republic of Ireland and Western Europe until late 2009, following Fiat&#x27;s takeover of Chrysler Group. This version continued with SE and SXT trim levels but was not badged the same way as North American or South American versions.

===2010===
Under the influence of Fiat, the 2010 model year Avenger sedan had few changes. New were front side and head-curtain airbags as well as head-impact protection in the front seats. The optional all-wheel drive was discontinued, limiting the Avenger to only front-wheel drive. The 2.7 L V6 was dropped, leaving two different drivetrains: a 2.4 L ( I4 with four-speed automatic transmission (the SXT model) or a 3.5 L ( V6 with AutoStick six-speed (available on the R/T). The Avenger featured a soft ride while the R/T versions included a firmer suspension, front and rear stabilizer bars, and 18-inch wheels.

===2011===

For the 2011 model year, the Avenger received its first significant overhaul since its 2008 reintroduction. Exterior changes include slightly revised sheet metal with a new crosshair grille displaying the new Dodge logo on the lower right corner of the grille, a sleeker bumper cut design, and standard LED combination taillights. Changes to the interior are more noticeable with a completely redesigned dashboard and instrument panel featuring an available 6.5-inch navigation/media center screen. Higher-quality soft-touch plastics for dashboard, door, and trim panels replaced the old materials, which were criticized for their poor fit and finish quality, as well as being unpleasant to the touch. The seats receive better cushioning and higher-grade upholstery. Two-tone interior color combinations were available.

Mechanically, the 2011 Avenger came standard with the existing 2.4 L GEMA I4. However, it was now paired with a six-speed automatic or the option of having the previous four-speed. Also available was the new 3.6 L &quot;Pentastar&quot; V6, rated at and of torque. The suspension was revised to improve handling and ride quality. Trim level designations were replaced by Express, Mainstreet, Lux, and Heat models.

==Total sales==
===Safety===
The 2008 through 2014 Avenger, also sold as the Chrysler Sebring from 2008 until 2010, and the Chrysler 200 from 2011 through 2014, received an overall &quot;Good&quot; rating by the IIHS, indicating no significant injuries. The car received an overall &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating in the small overlap test due to marginal dummy kinematics and slight intrusion into the passenger compartment. In the side test, the Avenger earned a &quot;Good&quot; rating; however, rib fractures were possible for the driver. In the roof strength evaluation, it gained a &quot;Good&quot; rating, as well as for its head restraints and seats.

The Avenger earned the &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014 as well as earned the &quot;Top Safety Pick+&quot; award in 2013.

===Discontinuation===
The discontinuation of the Dodge Avenger was announced by the automaker in early 2014, along with the end of the Chrysler 200 convertible model. The final 2014 model year Avengers were produced during the first quarter 2014. 

The Avenger nameplate has since been revived as the Jeep Avenger with the 2023 model year.

==Motorsport==
The first-generation Dodge Avenger body style was widely used in the National Hot Rod Association and earned the most prominence driven by Darrell Alderman and Scott Geoffrion from 1994 until 2000 as the &quot;Dodge Boys&quot;.

The coupe was used for the 1994 and 1995 incarnations of the International Race of Champions. Although Dodge was IROC&#x27;s car of choice since 1990, Dodge dropped out of this racing series after the 1995 season.

Avenger sheet metal was also used on race cars by several ARCA race teams from 1995 until 2000.

The Avenger replaced the Charger as Dodge&#x27;s car for the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Season. It appeared in Dodge Avenger grille, headlights, and taillights as the standard &quot;spec&quot; Car of Tomorrow (CoT) model. It got its first win with former Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya in the 2007 Toyota/Save Mart 350 at the Infineon Raceway.

In 2008, the Dodge CoT appearance was changed back to the Charger model.

<doc id="873213" wikidata="Q283364" url="?curid=873213" title="Battle of Legnano">
<text>The battle of Legnano was a battle between the imperial army of Frederick Barbarossa and the troops of the Lombard League on 29 May 1176, near the town of Legnano, in present-day Lombardy, Italy. Although the presence of the enemy nearby was already known to both sides, they suddenly met without having time to plan any strategy.

The battle was crucial in the long war waged by the Holy Roman Empire in an attempt to assert its power over the municipalities of northern Italy, which decided to set aside their mutual rivalries and join in a military alliance symbolically led by Pope Alexander III, the Lombard League.

The battle ended the fifth and last descent into Italy of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who after the defeat tried to resolve the Italian question by adopting a diplomatic approach. This resulted a few years later in the Peace of Constance (25 June 1183), with which the Emperor recognized the Lombard League and made administrative, political, and judicial concessions to the municipalities, officially ending his attempt to dominate northern Italy.

The battle is alluded to in the &quot;Canto degli Italiani&quot; by Goffredo Mameli and Michele Novaro, which reads: «From the Alps to Sicily, Legnano is everywhere» in memory of the victory of Italian populations over foreign ones. Thanks to this battle, Legnano is the only city, besides Rome, to be mentioned in the Italian national anthem. In Legnano, to commemorate the battle, the Palio di Legnano takes place annually from 1935, on the last Sunday of May. In the institutional sphere, the date of 29 May was chosen as the regional holiday of Lombardy.

==Background==

===Historical context===

The clash between the municipalities of northern Italy and imperial power originated in the struggle for investitures, or in that conflict which involved, in the 11th and the 12th centuries, the Papacy, the Holy Roman Empire, and their respective factions, the so-called &quot;Guelphs and Ghibellines&quot;, respectively. At times it was a dispute so bitter that several municipalities in northern Italy came to dismiss their bishops on the charge of simony, inasmuch as they had been invested in their offices by the emperor and not by the Pope.

The dispute about investitures was not the only source of friction between the Empire and the municipalities of northern Italy. A crisis of feudalism arose with the economic growth of northern Italian cities and their emerging desire to free themselves from imperial administration. Furthermore, the Italian territories of the Holy Roman Empire were distinctly different from the Germanic ones in socioeconomic and cultural aspects, and were not sympathetic to imperial power wielded by an authority of German lineage. Moreover, the nobility of the Italian territories dominated by the Empire were much less (and progressively less) involved in the administrative functions of the city-dominated regions, than the nobility were in German lands. Because of the frictions that arose in the 11th and the 12th centuries, the cities of northern Italy experienced a rising ferment that led to the birth of a new form of local self-government based on an elective collegial body with administrative, judicial, and security functions, and which in turn designated city consuls: the medieval commune.

This institutional evolution was contemporary with the investiture struggle. When a city&#x27;s bishop, who had traditionally exerted a strong influence on the civil matters of the municipality, became largely preoccupied with the contest between Empire and Papacy, the citizens were stimulated, and in some ways obliged, to seek a form of self-government that could act independently in times of serious difficulty. Citizens became increasingly aware of the public affairs of their own municipality and disinclined to accept the ecclesiastical and feudal structures, with their rigid and hierarchical management of the government. The change that led to a collegial management of public administration was rooted in the Lombard domination of northern Italy; this Germanic people was in fact accustomed to settling the most important questions (which were usually of military nature) through an assembly presided over by the king and composed of the most valiant soldiers, the &quot;&quot;gairethinx&quot; or &quot;arengo&quot;&quot;. City consuls generally came from the increasingly dominant (merchant and professional) classes of a city; although the duration of a consul&#x27;s mandate was only one year, and there was a certain turnover of individuals in the positions, a communal administration sometimes amounted to a coterie of leading families that shared municipal power in oligarchic fashion. In any case the northern Italian cities gradually ceased to recognize feudal institutions, which now seemed outdated.

Moreover, previous emperors, for various vicissitudes, adopted for a certain period an attitude of indifference towards the issues of northern Italy, taking more care to establish relations that provided for supervision of the Italian situation rather than the effective exercise of power. As a consequence, imperial power did not prevent the expansionist aims of the various municipalities in the surrounding territories and other towns, and cities began taking up arms against each other in contests to achieve regional hegemony.

Frederick Barbarossa, on the other hand, repudiated the policy of his predecessors by attempting to restore imperial control over the northern Italian municipalities, also on the basis of the requests of some of the latter, who repeatedly asked for imperial intervention to limit Milan&#x27;s desire for supremacy: in 1111 and 1127 the city conquered, respectively, Lodi and Como, forcing Pavia, Cremona and Bergamo to passivity.

To make matters worse the relations between the Empire and the municipalities were further soured by the harsh measures implemented by imperial authorities against the Milanese region. Of these, two contributed the most to fuel anti-imperial sentiment: to try to interrupt the supplies in Milan during one of his descents in Italy, in 1160, the emperor devastated the area north of the city destroying the crops and fruit trees of farmers. In particular, in fifteen days Barbarossa destroyed the countryside of Vertemate, Mediglia, Verano, Briosco, Legnano, Nerviano, Pogliano and Rho. The second event was instead linked to the measures taken by Frederick Barbarossa after the surrender of Milan (1162): the imperial vicar who administered the Milanese countryside after the defeat of Milan forced the farmers of the area to pay a heavy annual tax of foodstuffs for the emperor, which made the population increasingly hostile to imperial power.

===The first three descents of Frederick Barbarossa in Italy===

To try to pacify northern Italy and restore imperial power, Frederick Barbarossa crossed the Alps at the head of his army five times. The first descent, which began in the autumn of 1154 and led only 1,800 men, led the king to besiege and conquer the riotous Asti, Chieri and Tortona and to attack some castles of the Milanese countryside, but not the capital of Milan, given that he did not have sufficient forces. This campaign continued with the convocation of diet of Roncaglia, with which Frederick re-established imperial authority, nullifying, among other things, the conquests made by Milan in previous years, especially with regard to Como and Lodi. The first part of that journey continued along the Via Francigena and ended in Rome with the coronation of Frederick Barbarossa as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Adrian IV (18 June 1155). During his stay in Rome, Frederick, who had left from the north with the title of King of Germany, was harshly contested by the people of the city; in response, the emperor reacted by stifling the revolt in blood. Following this episode, and to Frederick&#x27;s military campaign, the relations between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy began to crack. During the return trip to Germany, the emperor destroyed Spoleto, accused of having paid the &quot;fodro&quot;, that is, the taxes to be paid to the sovereign, with a false currency. Already during this first descent, the difference between Frederick and his predecessors was felt. In fact, Barbarossa showed a strong aversion to municipal autonomies: his will was to restore effective power over northern Italy.

The second descent, which began in June 1158, was originated by the rebelliousness of Milan and the allied municipalities to accept imperial power. This long expedition began with the attack of Frederick Barbarossa in Milan and his allies of the Milanese countryside: after defeating Brescia, which was a Milanese company, and having freed Lodi from the Milanese yoke, Barbarossa directed the attack to the Milanese capital, who agreed to surrender (8 September 1158) to avoid a long and bloody siege. Milan again lost the conquests made in previous years (Como, Pavia, Seprio and Brianza), but it was not razed. Frederick Barbarossa, then, summoned a second diet to Roncaglia (autumn 1158) where he reiterated the imperial dominion over the municipalities of northern Italy, with the authority of the sovereign that imposed itself on that of the local institutions, establishing, among other things, that the regalie were entirely paid to the sovereign. The proclamations of this second diet of Roncaglia had disruptive effects on the Italian communes, which immediately rebelled. After receiving reinforcements from Germany and having conquered several riotous municipalities in northern Italy during a military campaign that lasted a few years, Barbarossa turned its attention to Milan, which was first besieged in 1162 and then, after its surrender (1 March), completely destroyed. A similar fate fell on several cities allied to Milan. Frederick then exacerbated the grip of imperial power on Italian cities, going beyond the provisions decided during Roncaglia&#x27;s second diet: he set up a bureaucratic structure run by officials who responded directly to the emperor instead of the municipal autonomies, which were virtually suppressed, and established an imperial-nominated at the head of the rebel cities. Meanwhile, Pope Adrian IV died and his successor, Pope Alexander III, soon proved to be in solidarity with the Italian municipalities and particularly hostile to the emperor.

In 1163 the rebellion of some cities in northeastern Italy forced Frederick Barbarossa to descend for the third time in Italy in a military campaign that ended up in a stalemate, above all against the Veronese League, which in the meantime had formed between some cities of the March of Verona. With pacific Lombardy, Frederick in fact preferred to postpone the clash with the other municipalities of northern Italy due to the numerical scarcity of his troops and then, after having verified the situation, he returned to Germany.

===The fourth military campaign in Italy and the Lombard League===
At the end of 1166 the emperor went to Italy for the fourth time at the head of a powerful army. To avoid the Marca of Verona, after having crossed the Alps from the Brenner Pass, instead of going along the usual Adige Valley, Barbarossa turned towards Val Camonica; its objective was not, however, the attack on the rebellious Italian communes, but the Papacy. In fact, Frederick sided with the Antipope Paschal III, who in the meantime had ousted the legitimate pontiff, Alexander III, from Peter&#x27;s throne; the latter, in 1165, after having obtained the recognition of the other European sovereigns, had returned to Rome, but Barbarossa, mindful of the role that his predecessors had on papal appointments, decided to intervene directly. As a test of strength, and for demonstration purposes, Frederick attacked some cities in northern Italy, reaching Rome victorious, but an epidemic that spread among the ranks of the imperial army (perhaps of malaria) and which also affected the emperor himself, forced him to leave Rome, which in the meantime had surrendered, and to return precipitously to northern Italy in search of reinforcements (August 1167).

A few months before the epidemic that struck the imperial army, the municipalities of northern Italy had joined forces in the Lombard League, a military union whose Latin name was Societas Lombardiae. According to the traditional narrative the municipalities sealed their alliance on 7 April 1167 with the oath of Pontida; this event, however, is questioned by historians for its lack of mention in contemporary chronicles and because the first mention of the oath is late, given that it appears in a document dated 1505. On 1 December 1167 the Lombard League expanded considerably with the accession of the municipalities of the Lega Veronese. Arrived in northern Italy, Frederick decided to face the League, but finding himself in a stalemate that was caused by some failed sieges and by the constant growth of the number of cities that adhered to the municipal military alliance, he decided to postpone the confrontation and to return to Germany (1168). After the emperor&#x27;s departure, the role of the Lombard League was limited to the diplomatic or military resolution of the diatribes that periodically broke out between the municipalities belonging to the alliance.

Shortly after Barbarossa returned to Germany, the League founded a new city, Alessandria, named in honor of Pope Alexander III, who sided with the Italian municipalities so that the municipal military coalition was symbolically headed by the same Pope. The foundation of a new city without the consent of the imperial authority was a serious setback to Frederick Barbarossa, who decided to definitively resolve the Italian question.

===The fifth and last descent===
In 1174 Frederick Barbarossa, to try to resolve the situation once and for all, went down to Italy for the fifth time with a powerful army of about 10,000 men. Instead of crossing the Alps from the usual Brenner, guarded by the League, the emperor had passed from Savoy thanks to the support of Count Humbert III. In the first phase of the campaign he succeeded in easily subjugating some cities of northwestern Italy, trying without luck to conquer also Alessandria (1174–1175). After this unfortunate siege, with the exhausted army, Frederick went to Pavia (April 1175), his ally and shortly before sacked by the municipal armies, to try to find an agreement with the army of the League, but without success. During the negotiations the emperor thought, at a certain point, that the agreement was close and therefore dismissed most of his army; the negotiations, however, failed in May 1175 and the armies prepared themselves again for the war.

Realizing the mistake he made, which would later prove decisive, the emperor met his cousin Henry the Lion and other feudal lords in Chiavenna between January and February 1176 with the aim of asking for reinforcements to continue his campaign. When Henry denied him these, Frederick turned to his wife Beatrice of Burgundy; Rainald of Dassel, the archbishop of Cologne and Archchancellor; and Wichmann von Seeburg, archbishop of Magdeburg, asking for additional troops to be sent to Italy; after receiving the support of the latter, he moved to Bellinzona to wait for them. Upon the arrival of the troops, Frederick realized, however, that their number was much lower than expected, since they consisted only of a number of knights including, according to the discordant sources of the time, between 1,000 and 2,000 units (the latter, according to most historians, is the most probable).

Despite the insufficient number of reinforcements coming from Germany and other Italian allies, the emperor decided to leave the alpine valleys resuming the march from Como to Pavia, both of his allies, in a hostile territory but characterized by the presence of vast areas covered with an impenetrable forest that allowed a relatively safe journey. His goal was to meet with the rest of his militias and to clash with the municipal troops in the Milanese or in Alessandria; Frederick Barbarossa was in fact certain that a march in forced stages towards Pavia could have prevented the municipal troops from intercepting it. The Lombard League, on the other hand, decided to engage in battle with the imperial army as soon as possible to prevent the reunification of the Teutonic armies; this despite being still in reduced ranks (15,000 men), given that he could not count on all the military forces specified in the various cities forming part of the alliance (30,000 men), which were in fact still converging on Milan.

The Lombard League was headed by the Cremonese Anselmo da Dovara and by the Vicentine Ezzelino I da Romano representing the two souls of the coalition, the Lombard and the Venetian. The military operations of the municipal troops, on this occasion, were instead guided by the Milanese Guido da Landriano, former consul of the Milanese capital, rector of the Lombard League as well as an expert knight.

==Stages of battle==

===Frederick Barbarossa in Cairate===
On the night of 28-29 May 1176, during the descent towards Pavia, Frederick Barbarossa was with his troops at the monastery of the Benedictine nuns of Cairate for a stop which later proved to be fatal, since it caused a delay compared to the contemporaneous moves of the Lombard League. The emperor probably spent the night in Castelseprio in the manor of the counts of the homonymous county, who were bitter enemies of Milan. Barbarossa decided to stop in Cairate to cross the River Olona, the only natural barrier that separated it from the faithful Pavia, trusting to have the possibility to enter the area controlled by the allied city after having traveled the remaining 50 km in a horse day.

Overall, according to most historians, the imperial army encamped in Cairate was formed by 3,000 men (2,000 of whom were reinforcements from Germany), the vast majority of whom were heavy cavalry, who was able, if necessary, to fight on foot. Despite the numerical disparity, the extent of the Teutonic army was highly respected, given that it consisted of professional soldiers. The army of the League was instead mainly made up of private citizens who were recruited in case of need; the knights of the League, given the high cost of the steed and armor, were of high social extraction, while the infantry were mostly peasants and citizens from the low social classes.

===The Carroccio in Legnano===
However, the information regarding Barbarossa encamped in Cairate did not reach the leaders of the Lombard League, who were convinced that the emperor was distant, still in Bellinzona waiting for the reinforcement troops. For this reason, the Carroccio, the emblem of the autonomy of the municipalities belonging to the Lombard League carrying the cross of Aribert, escorted by a few hundred men of the League, was transferred from Milan to Legnano, leaving from the capital of Milan from Porta Romana, and then up the Olona to its final destination. In Legnano the Carroccio was placed along a slope flanking the river, presumably wooded, to have a natural defense on at least one side, that traced by the stream.

In this way, Barbarossa, who was expected along the river coming from Castellanza, would have been obliged to attack the municipal army in a situation of disadvantage, having to go back to this depression. This choice turned out to be wrong: in fact Barbarossa arrived from Borsano (nowadays &quot;frazione&quot; (hamlet) of Busto Arsizio), that is from the opposite side, forcing the municipal troops to resist around the Carroccio with the escape road blocked by the Olona. Another possible reason that led the municipal troops to position the Carroccio in Legnano was to anticipate Barbarossa, still believed to be far away, by making an incursion into the Seprio with the aim of preventing a new alliance between the two: the Seprio was in fact a historically connected territory with the emperor together with another area of Lombardy, the Martesana.
The Lombard League troops took possession of the area between Legnano, Busto Arsizio, and Borsano. The remaining part of the army, which on the whole was formed by about 15,000 men (3,000 of whom were knights, while 12,000 were infantry), followed with considerable detachment along the road between the Lombard capital and Legnano. The decision to place the Carroccio in Legnano was not accidental. At the time the village represented an easy access for those coming from the north to the Milanese countryside, given that it was located at the mouth of the Valle Olona, which ends at Castellanza; this passage had therefore to be closed and strenuously defended to prevent the attack on Milan, which was also facilitated by the presence of an important road that existed since Roman times, the &quot;Via Severiana Augusta&quot;, which connected &quot;Mediolanum&quot; (the modern Milan) with the &quot;Verbanus Lacus&quot; (Lake Verbano, or Lake Maggiore), and from there to the Simplon Pass (lat. &quot;Summo Plano&quot;). His journey was then taken up by Napoleon Bonaparte to build the Simplon state road.

For this reason, in Legnano there was a high medieval fortification, the castle of the Cotta, which was built at the time of the Hungarian raids and which was later used during the battle of Legnano as a military outpost. Later, the castle of the Cotta was replaced, as a defensive bulwark of Legnano, by the Castle Visconteo, which rises further south along the Olona. The Cotta castle was flanked by a defensive system formed by walls and a flooded moat that encircled the inhabited center, and by two access gates to the village: medieval Legnano thus appeared as a fortified citadel.

A second reason that explains the positioning of the Carroccio in Legnano lay in the fact that the Legnanese was a territory not hostile to the troops of the Lombard League, given that the population of the area was still mindful of the devastation operated by Frederick Barbarossa a few years earlier; these people would also have provided logistical support to the troops of the League. From a strategic point of view, in Legnano the municipal army was therefore in a position that would have prevented the emperor from making the most logical moves: to attack Milan or reach Pavia.

===The first contact between the armies in Borsano===
After spending the night in Cairate, Frederick Barbarossa resumed the march on Pavia heading towards the Ticino. Meanwhile, some avant-gardes of the Lombard League army stationed in Legnano, formed by 700 knights, broke away from the main army and searched the territory between Borsano and Busto Arsizio. According to other sources, the knights instead controlled the area between Borsano and Legnano, in other words, the modern-day districts of Ponzella and Mazzafame.

At 3 miles (about 4.5 km) from Legnano, near Cascina Brughetto, the 700 municipal knights on the track crossed—just outside a forest—300 knights of the imperial army on patrol, which represented only the vanguards of Frederick&#x27;s troops. Being numerically superior, the Knights of the League attacked the imperial column and succeeded, at least initially, in gaining the upper hand. Immediately after the first clashes, Barbarossa arrived with the bulk of the army and charged the municipal troops. Some chroniclers of the time report that Barbarossa&#x27;s advisers had suggested to the emperor to stall for a new strategy, but the sovereign would have refused to take advantage of the numerical superiority and not to be forced to retreat towards hostile territories; furthermore, a retreat would have affected the prestige of the emperor. The fate of the battle, therefore, reversed and the imperial troops forced the first rows of the municipal army to back off in confusion.

The strong impact then forced the municipal knights to retreat towards Milan, leaving the soldiers alone who were in Legnano to defend the Carroccio. Barbarossa therefore decided to attack the latter with the cavalry, given that it was defended only by the infantry—according to the canons of the time considered to be clearly inferior to the cavalry—and to a small number of militias on horseback.

===The defense of the Carroccio in Legnano and the epilogue===
At this point an exceptional event occurred with respect to the traditional dominance of cavalry on infantry of that period. In Legnano the municipal infantry, with the few remaining knights, after being attacked by Barbarossa, settled around the Carroccio (maintaining a certain distance from the symbol of their municipalities), organizing themselves on some defensive lines along a wide semicircle 2–3 km, each of which consisted of soldiers protected by shields. Between one shield and another the lances were then stretched, with the first row of foot soldiers fighting on their knees so as to form a jumble of spears aimed at the enemy. During the fight, which lasted eight to nine hours from morning to three in the afternoon and which was characterized by repeated charges punctuated by long pauses to make the armies repackage and refurbish, the first two lines finally gave way, but the third resisted shocks. According to other sources, the rows that capitulated were instead four, with a fifth and last that rejected the attacks.

Meanwhile, the municipal troops who were retreating towards Milan met the bulk of the Lombard League army moving towards Legnano; the municipal army, now reunified, after having reorganized moved towards Legnano and arrived at the point where the Carroccio was located attacked the imperial troops on the sides and from behind, who were already tired from the vain assaults on the Carroccio. With the arrival of the cavalry, also the infantrymen around the communal cart passed to the counteroffensive. Sensing that the heart of the battle was now around the Carroccio, Frederick Barbarossa, with his usual audacity, threw himself into the middle of the fray trying to encourage his troops, but without appreciable results. In the heat of battle his horse was mortally wounded and the emperor disappeared to the sight of the fighters; in addition, the imperial army standard-bearer was killed, pierced by a spear. The imperials, attacked on two sides, then began to become discouraged and faced a total defeat.

The strategy of the imperials to resist until the evening and then, at the end of the battle, fall back to catch up and reorganize did not go well. They tried to flee towards Ticino passing from Dairago and Turbigo, but were pursued by the troops of the Lombard League for eight miles. The waters of the river were the theater of the last phases of the battle, which ended with the capture and killing of many soldiers of the imperial army and with the sacking of the military camp of Frederick Barbarossa in Legnano. The emperor himself found it difficult to escape capture and reach the faithful Pavia.

After the battle, the Milanese wrote to the Bolognese, their allies in the League, a letter stating, among other things, that they had in custody, right in Milan, a conspicuous loot in gold and silver, the banner, the shield and the imperial spear, and a large number of prisoners, including Count Berthold I of Zähringen (one of the princes of the Empire), Philip of Alsace (one of the empress&#x27;s grandchildren) and Gosvino of Heinsberg (the brother of the Archbishop of Cologne).

==Losses==
There are no precise data on the losses suffered by the two armies that faced each other in the battle of Legnano; from the descriptions in our possession, however, it can be affirmed that the imperial ones were heavy, while the losses attributable to the municipal army were quite slight.

According to some studies conducted by Guido Sutermeister, part of the dead of the battle of Legnano were buried around the little church of San Giorgio, now no longer in existence, which once stood on the top of the hill of San Martino along the modern via Dandolo, in the near the church of San Martino in Legnano.

==Analysis of battle==
From the military point of view, the battle of Legnano was a significant battle that involved a considerable number of men. Other important battles fought in the same period in fact employed a comparable number of soldiers: for example, 1,400 Aragonese knights and 800 French were involved in the Battle of Muret.

At the strategic level, the clash between the two armies was carefully prepared by both factions. Barbarossa meticulously chose the place to cross the Alps, deciding to wait for reinforcements and to cross the Alpine arch again centrally in place of the usual Brenner, to easily reach Pavia. In fact, the second choice would have involved a much longer journey in enemy territory. Moreover, shortening the journey to Alexandria, his real goal, he focused on the surprise effect, which he partly obtained. Even the leaders of the Lombard League acted with foresight: to beat the emperor on time, they anticipated the times and moved towards Legnano to block the way towards the rest of his army, forcing him to fight in a territory known to them and therefore favorable.

One of the most important phases of the battle was the strong resistance of the infantry around the Carroccio after the temporary retreat of the cavalry; under the emblem of the autonomy of their municipalities, the municipal infantry resisted against a militarily superior army and moreover on horseback. The Carroccio also had a tactical function: being a very important symbol, in case of folding, the municipal army would have been obliged to protect it at all costs, and so it happened that, just to stay around the wagon, the municipal infantry they organized themselves into a semicircle defensive system. The position of the lances within this formation, all facing outwards, was certainly another reason for the victorious resistance, given that it constituted a defensive bulwark that could not be easily overcome Furthermore, the municipal troops, grouped on a territorial basis, were linked by kinship or neighborhood relations, which contributed to further compacting the ranks. In addition to fighting for their fellow soldiers, the municipal soldiers also fought for the freedom of their city and to defend their possessions and this led to a further stimulus to resistance against the enemy.

This battle is one of the first examples in which the medieval infantry could demonstrate its tactical potential towards the cavalry. The merit of the victory of the municipal troops must however also be shared with the light cavalry, which came later, which carried out the decisive charge against the imperials.

==Origins and places of battle==
At centuries of distance, given the scarcity of authentic information written by contemporary chroniclers at the events, it is difficult to establish precisely where the clashes took place. The chronicles of the epoch that deal with the battle of Legnano are in fact short writings formed by a number of words between one hundred and two hundred; the exception is the Life of Alexander III written by Boso Breakspeare, which reaches four hundred words. On some occasions there is the problem of the distortion of toponyms made by the copyists of the time, who did not know the geography of the area.

The contemporary sources that deal with the battle of Legnano are divided into three categories: the chronicles written by the Milanese or by the federated cities in the Lombard League, those written by the imperials or their allies and the ecclesiastical documents of the papal party. The contemporary Milanese chronicles unanimously report that the battle was fought &quot;de&quot;, &quot;apud&quot;, &quot;iuxta&quot;, &quot;ad Lignanum&quot; or &quot;inter Legnanum et Ticinum&quot;. Among them stands a document compiled by two anonymous chroniclers (&quot;Gesta Federici I imperatoris in Lombardy&quot;. Trad.: &quot;The exploits of Emperor Frederick I in Lombardy&quot;), whose two parts of the text, written by an unknown reporter between 1154 and 1167 and the other completed by another anonymous in 1177, they were copied in 1230 by Sire Raul. The annals of Brescia, of Crema, the Genoese chronicler Ottobono, Salimbene from Parma and the bishop of Crema also report &quot;apud Legnanum&quot;. The contemporary chronicles of the imperial part, on the other hand, do not specify the places of the conflict but merely describe the events; among the Teutonic documents, the most important are the annals of Cologne, the writings of Otto of Freising and the chronicles of Godfrey of Viterbo. The most important contemporary ecclesiastical sources are the writings of the Archbishop of Salerno and the &quot;Life of Alexander III&quot; drafted by Boso Breakspeare, with the first not referring to the indication of the places, and the second that report the crippled toponym of &quot;Barranum&quot;.

Among the sources after the battle, Bonvesin da la Riva, who wrote about a century after the fight, stated that the battle had taken place &quot;&quot;inter Brossanum et Legnanum&quot;, while Goffredo da Bussero, a contemporary of Bonvesin de la Riva, reported that &quot;imperator victus a Mediolanensisbus inter Legnanum et Borsanum&quot;&quot;.

The first phase of the battle, which is connected to the initial clash between the two armies, seems to have taken place between Borsano and Busto Arsizio. This thesis is supported, among other things, by the document of the two anonymous chroniclers, where it is said that:


As for the final stages of the battle, which are connected to the defense of the Carroccio and the subsequent and resolute clashes between the two armies, the &quot;Life of Alexander III&quot; of Boso Breakspeare, contemporary with the battle, provides an important indication: in this text we indicate the toponyms, evidently crippled by the copyists, of &quot;Barranum&quot; and &quot;Brixianum&quot;, which could indicate Legnano and Borsano or Busto Arsizio and Borsano, and the precise distance between the site of the last phases of the battle and Milan, 15 miles (about 22 km), which is the exact distance between Legnano and the Lombard capital. This distance of 15 miles was then used to refer to Legnano also in subsequent documents. In fact, in the &quot;Life of Alexander III&quot; we read that:

The same source also mentions the distance of 3 miles (about 4.5 km) from Legnano in reference to the first contact of the two armies, confirming the hypothesis that this phase of the clash took place between Borsano and Busto Arsizio. The same document states that:

Regarding the identification of the place where the troops of the Lombard League on the run met the remaining part of the army, the sources are conflicting. The chronicles of Boso Breakspeare report in fact that the crossing of the two armies took place at half a mile (about 700 m) from the Carroccio:

The annals of Piacenza instead report that the contact occurred near Milan:

As regards the exact location of the Carroccio in reference to the current topography of Legnano, one of the chronicles of the clash, the Cologne Annals, contain important information:


This would suggest that the Carroccio was located on the edge of a steep slope flanking the Olona, so that the imperial cavalry, whose arrival was expected along the river, would have been forced to attack the center of the League&#x27;s army Lombard climbing up the escarpment. Considering the evolution of the clash, this could mean that the crucial phases in defense of the Carroccio have been fought on the territory of the Legnanese &quot;contrada&quot; of San Martino (more precisely, near the 15th century church of the same name, which in fact dominates a slope that descends towards the Olona) or of the Legnanese quarter of Costa San Giorgio, since in another part of the neighboring areas it is not possible to identify another depression with the characteristics suitable for its defense. Considering the last hypothesis mentioned, the final clash could also have taken place on part of the territory now belonging to the Legnanese &quot;contrade&quot; of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio and San Magno (between the quartier of &quot;Costa of San Giorgio&quot; and the Olona is still present today a steep slope: this slope was later included in the Parco castello) and to the municipality of San Giorgio su Legnano.

A popular legend tells that at that time a tunnel put San Giorgio su Legnano in communication with the Visconti castle of Legnano and that for this tunnel Frederick Barbarossa managed to escape and save himself after the defeat. Towards the end of the 20th century, during some excavations, sections of a very ancient tunnel were actually found: the first was found not far from San Giorgio su Legnano, while the second section was discovered in Legnano. Both were immediately blocked by the municipal administration for security reasons. During some excavations carried out in 2014 at the Visconti castle in Legnano, the entrance to another tunnel was identified.

==Aftermath ==
The battle of Legnano put an end to Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s fifth descent in Italy and his attempt to hegemonize the municipalities of northern Italy. Frederick also lost the military support of the German princes, who, after the 10,000 knights provided at the beginning of his campaign and the 3,000 laboriously collected shortly before the battle of Legnano, would hardly have given Barbarossa more aid to resolve the situation in Italy, which would have brought them very little benefit. Having no support at home, Frederick, to try to resolve the dispute, tried the diplomatic approach, with the armistice that was signed at the Venice congress of 1177. In this agreement, the emperor recognized, among other things, Alexander III as a legitimate pontiff and submitted to papal power by recomposing the schism that had arisen some years before. From then on, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy wife of Frederick ceased to be referred as Imperatrix (&#x27;empress&#x27;) in the chancery productions, as her coronation as such had been made by an anti-pope and was thus declared nullified.

The first negotiations for definitive peace took place in Piacenza between March and May 1183. The Lombard League asked Frederick Barbarossa the complete autonomy of the cities, the possibility of the latter to freely erect walls and fortifications, the exemption from all types of taxes and the absence of any kind of interference by the emperor in local matters; requests to which Frederick Barbarossa, in the first instance, firmly opposed. Shortly before the negotiations in Piacenza, from an imperial perspective, however, an important event occurred: Alessandria submitted to the imperial power and was recognized by Frederick as a city of the Empire.

The continuation of negotiations led to the signing of the Peace of Constance (25 June 1183), which first of all provided for the recognition of the Lombard League by Frederick Barbarossa. As regards the individual cities, the emperor made administrative, political and judicial concessions; in particular, Frederick granted a wide autonomy with respect to the management of land resources such as forests, water and mills, with respect to court cases and related penalties and, finally, with regard to military aspects, such as the recruitment of army and the free construction of defensive walls and castles. As far as legal proceedings were concerned, the imperial vicars would have intervened in disputes only for the appeal cases that involved goods or compensation worth more than 25 lire, but applying the laws in force in the individual municipalities. Moreover, Barbarossa confirmed the customary law that the cities had conquered in the thirty years of clashes with the Empire, and officially granted the municipalities the right to have a consul, who had to swear allegiance to the emperor.
The municipalities of the Lombard League, on the other hand, formally recognized the imperial authority and agreed to pay the fodro but not the royalties, which remained in the municipalities. Furthermore, the Italian municipalities agreed to pay the Empire, as taxes, 15,000 one-off lire and an annual sum of 2,000 lire. Earnings from the defeat of Frederick Barbarossa were not only Italian municipalities, but also the Papacy, which managed to emphasize its position of superiority over the Empire. The peace of Constance was the only imperial recognition of the prerogatives of Italian municipalities: for this reason, it was celebrated for centuries.

==Alberto da Giussano and the Company of Death==

The name of Alberto da Giussano appeared for the first time in the historical chronicle of the city of Milan written by the Dominican friar Galvano Fiamma in the first half of the 14th century, that is 150 years after the battle of Legnano. Alberto da Giussano was described as a knight who distinguished himself, together with his brothers Ottone and Raniero, in the battle of 29 May 1176. According to Galvano Fiamma, he headed the Company of Death, a military association of 900 young knights.

The Company of Death owed its name to the oath that made its members, which foresaw the struggle until the last breath without ever lowering its arms. According to Galvano Fiamma, the Company of Death defended the Carroccio to the extreme and then carried out, in the final stages of the battle of Legnano, a charge against the imperial army of Frederick Barbarossa.

However, contemporary sources at the battle of Legnano do not mention either the existence of Alberto da Giussano or that of the Company of Death. The stories of Fiamma should be taken with the benefit of the doubt since in his chronicles there are inaccuracies and legendary facts.

==National unification references==
In a proclamation issued in Bergamo on 3 August 1848, the revolutionary leader Garibaldi referred to the historic battle of Legnano as a source of inspiration for his own struggle for the unification of Italy: &quot;Bergamo will be the Pontida of the present generation, and God will bring us a Legnano!&quot;. In a similar vein Il Canto degli Italiani, written in 1847 and now the Italian national anthem, contains the lines, &quot;From the Alps to Sicily, Legnano is everywhere.&quot;

<doc id="873218" wikidata="Q1707212" url="?curid=873218" title="Marcus Trescothick">
<text>Marcus Edward Trescothick (born 25 December 1975) is an English former cricketer who played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club, and represented England in 76 Test matches and 123 One Day Internationals. He was Somerset captain from 2010 to 2016 and temporary England captain for several Tests and ODIs. Since retirement he has commentated and coached at both county and international level.

A left-handed opening batsman, he made his first-class debut for Somerset in 1993 and quickly established himself as a regular member of the team. Trescothick made his One Day International (ODI) debut seven years later, against Zimbabwe in July 2000. His Test debut, against the West Indies, followed in August. Although former England captain Nasser Hussain likened Trescothick&#x27;s build and batting temperament to that of Graham Gooch, his stroke play is more reminiscent of David Gower.

An aggressive opener, he once held the record for the most ODI centuries of any English player, and for the fastest half-century in English Twenty20 cricket. Trescothick is also an accomplished slip fielder and occasional right-handed medium pace bowler who has kept wicket for England in five ODIs, and deputised as England captain for two Test matches and ten ODIs.

Trescothick was an automatic choice for England between 2000 and 2006, before a stress-related illness threatened his career and forced him to pull out of the national squad. He began rebuilding his career with Somerset in 2007 and scored two double-centuries that season. However, he remained uneasy about returning to international cricket, and announced his retirement from internationals in March 2008, opting to continue playing at county level for Somerset. Media speculation continued as to a possible international return, Trescothick repeatedly voiced his intent to remain in retirement, and has suffered recurrences of his condition in both 2008 and 2009 when Somerset toured abroad. He nevertheless continued to play for Somerset while also working as a commentator and analyst for Sky Sports in the off-season. He finally retired in 2019 holding several Somerset batting records. He is currently the lead batting coach for the England Test team.

==Early years==
Marcus Edward Trescothick was born on 25 December 1975 in Keynsham, Somerset. He was the younger of two children born to Martyn and Linda Trescothick; his sister, Anna, is three years older than him. His father was a good amateur cricketer, and had played two matches for Somerset County Cricket Club&#x27;s second team and appeared for Bristol and District Cricket Association between 1967 and 1976, before becoming a stalwart at Keynsham Cricket Club, where his mother made the club teas. Trescothick was immersed into cricket from an early age; the notice announcing his birth in the local newspaper had a quote from his father saying &quot;he will have every encouragement to become a cricketer when he grows up&quot;, and he received his first cricket bat when he was eleven months old.

During his time at St Anne&#x27;s primary school, he was chosen to play for the Avon School under-11 cricket team. He scored the first century for Avon, striking 124 against Devon, and a couple of weeks later remained not out on 183 when the coach declared the innings closed, claiming &quot;if I let him get a double-hundred at his age, what else would he have to aim for?&quot; That score created some interest in the local media, and Gloucestershire County Cricket Club invited him to play for their under-11 team. In his second match for the county, he scored a century against Somerset, who then discovered that Trescothick, living in Keynsham, was qualified to play for them, and he switched from Gloucestershire to Somerset, proud to play for his father&#x27;s old county.

His education continued at the Sir Bernard Lovell School in Oldland Common near Bristol, and by the age of 14 he was playing alongside his father for Keynsham in the Western League. Around the same time, he was selected to play for the England under-14s alongside future international team-mates Andrew Flintoff and Paul Collingwood. In his autobiography, &quot;Coming Back to Me&quot;, Trescothick recalls that he was bigger than most of the other boys his age, which gave him a strength advantage, enabling him to hit the ball harder and further than others. At the same time, concerns were raised about his &quot;portly&quot; figure, with suggestions that he would need to work on his fitness. The following season, aged 15, Trescothick scored 4,000 runs between all the different teams he was representing, which by this time included the Somerset under-19s. He was named as the &quot;outstanding young cricketer of the year&quot; by &quot;The Cricketer&quot;. He was nicknamed &quot;Tresco&quot; and &quot;Banger&quot;, the latter deriving from his diet as a young player:

My diet was sausages then, in no particular order, sausages, chips, sausages, toast, sausages, beans, sausages, cheese, sausages, eggs, and the occasional sausage.
==Early domestic career==
Trescothick&#x27;s first full season at Somerset in 1994 was one of his best, where he scored a total of 925 runs, including two centuries and eight half-centuries at an impressive batting average of 48.63. Having played for the English U-19 cricket team against the West Indies in 1993, and Sri Lanka and India in 1994, Trescothick was named captain for the two Under-19 series against West Indies and South Africa in 1995. His career aggregate of 1,032 runs for England U-19 is second only to John Crawley&#x27;s 1,058.
Trescothick was not as successful in domestic cricket in 1995, although there were still some highlights including an innings of 151 against Northamptonshire (a third of his season&#x27;s total), and a hat-trick, including the wicket of century-maker Adam Gilchrist, for Somerset against Young Australia. Trescothick&#x27;s England Under-19 form was still excellent, averaging 74.62 with the bat in six matches. His Under-19 team mates would often mock him for wearing an England blazer after his matches; Trescothick would reply by saying that &quot;it might be the closest I get to playing for England&quot;.

The following five years were mixed for Trescothick. Averaging about 30 runs per innings, he was often criticised for a lack of foot movement. David Gower described Trescothick&#x27;s technique by saying &quot;he does not need to move a long way but needs to move enough. When he is playing well ... he is very good at transferring weight. When he is not playing well, his feet get stuck&quot;. However, Trescothick was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award for Somerset&#x27;s most promising young county player in the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In 1997, Somerset Second XI were set 612 to win by Warwickshire Second XI, and Trescothick scored 322 to bring the Seconds to 605.

In 1999, Trescothick impressed Glamorgan coach Duncan Fletcher in a county match at Taunton, by scoring 167 in a low-scoring match where the next-highest innings was 50. When England opening batsman Nick Knight sustained a finger injury in 2000, Fletcher, who had been appointed England coach, called on Trescothick to make his England debut in the NatWest Series against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. Trescothick&#x27;s regular selection for England meant that he was rarely available for domestic selection between 2000 and 2006, often playing only a few matches for Somerset at the start of the season.

==International career==

===Debut and centuries on maiden tour===
Trescothick participated in two England A tours during the winter of 1999, but his full One Day International debut came against Zimbabwe at The Oval on 9 July 2000, when he scored 79. He continued his good form in the tournament with a Man of the Match-winning 87 not out against the West Indies at Chester-le-street, amassing 288 runs at an average of 48.00 and taking two wickets against Zimbabwe at Old Trafford.

As a result of his good form in the NatWest series, Trescothick was given his Test match debut later that summer in the third Test against the West Indies at Old Trafford. He displayed a calm temperament when England lost early wickets, scoring 66 and forming a partnership of 179 with Alec Stewart. Journalist Thrasy Petropoulos observed that there was &quot;poise and durability...just as there had been enterprise and verve to his impressive start in the one-day arena.&quot; He ended the Test series with an average of 47.50.
England began the 2000–2001 winter tour with the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy at Nairobi Gymkhana Club. Trescothick did not score highly in the tournament, and England were knocked out at the quarter-final stage against South Africa. Trescothick was named the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association Player of the Year for his performances for Somerset throughout 2000.

Trescothick&#x27;s maiden international century came against the Sindh Governor&#x27;s XI in October 2000, during the first warm-up match to the Pakistan series. Trescothick reached his highest score (71) of the three Test matches in the opening innings of the first Test. He took his sole Test wicket in the third Test, when Ashley Giles caught the Pakistan opener Imran Nazir.

Trescothick started the Sri Lanka tour with a century against a Sri Lanka &#x27;Colts XI&#x27;. He was the top scorer in both innings of the first Test with 122 and 57, although this was overshadowed by Marvan Atapattu&#x27;s 201 not out in Sri Lanka&#x27;s innings. Trescothick averaged 41.33 in the Test series, but only 16.00 in the three subsequent ODIs.

England played two Test matches against Pakistan in June 2001. Although Trescothick scored 117 in the second Test, it was not enough for England to win the match. His ODI form improved at the start of the 2001 NatWest Series against Australia and Pakistan, with scores of 69 and 137 respectively. However, his series ended with two consecutive ducks, and England lost all their matches in the tournament.

===England&#x27;s leading batsman, 2001–02===
Although Trescothick was England&#x27;s second highest run scorer in the 2001 Ashes series, he displayed a tendency to give his wicket away when &quot;well set&quot;. England lost the series 4–1, with the majority of the England batsmen&#x27;s contributions being overshadowed by Mark Butcher&#x27;s 173 not out to win the fourth Test. Trescothick&#x27;s apparent inability to make major scores was again apparent in the 2001–02 One Day International series in Zimbabwe, where he only passed 50 on one occasion despite scoring consistently. He also captained the side for the first time in this series, deputising for the injured Nasser Hussain.

Trescothick really came into his own on the winter tour of India in 2001. The three-Test series saw him averaging 48.00, with a highest score of 99. He was England&#x27;s best batsman in the ODI series, averaging 53.00 with a strike rate of over 100. He scored a century in the first ODI, although England lost by 22 runs. He established a reputation for keeping his composure while the rest of the team were failing; at this point, none of Trescothick&#x27;s four international centuries had resulted in an England win. He was also man-of-the-match in the final ODI, setting up an England victory, with 95 runs from 80 balls. This tour established Trescothick&#x27;s reputation as one of England&#x27;s best batsmen against spin bowling: according to David Gower, he was &quot;judging line and length very well&quot;. &quot;Indian Cricket&quot; named him one of their five Cricketers of the Year for 2002. The following tour of New Zealand was less successful for Trescothick, only once reaching double figures in a poor ODI series, coupled with an average Test match performance.

Trescothick had been playing well in 2002, scoring 161 in the Sri Lankan series and being awarded the Player of the Series in the tri-nation NatWest Series (including a century in the final), until his season was cut short when he fractured his thumb while fielding. He returned for the fourth Test against India, scoring two half-centuries. Trescothick had mixed fortunes in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy; he followed his century in the NatWest final with a man-of-the-match winning 119 against Zimbabwe, but failed to score as England lost to India and exited the tournament.

In October, Trescothick was one of 11 players awarded &quot;central contracts&quot; by the ECB, which compensate a player&#x27;s county for their lack of domestic appearances.

Trescothick was overshadowed by Michael Vaughan during the 2002–03 Ashes series, averaging only 26.10 with a top score of 72 in comparison to Vaughan&#x27;s average of 63.30 and three centuries. Trescothick averaged 31.60 across 10 matches in the VB Series, but England were outplayed by Australia throughout the tour. Trescothick failed to excel in the 2003 World Cup as England failed to qualify for the knock-out stages. In his five matches, Trescothick&#x27;s top score was 58 against Namibia, with a tournament average of 23.20.

===Continued success in 2003 and 2004===

Trescothick played well against a weak Zimbabwe side in the two-Test series in May–June 2003, and scored an unbeaten century in the three ODIs against Pakistan averaging over 100. His form continued in the 2003 NatWest Series, with 114 not out against South Africa. The opening stand with Vikram Solanki of 200 runs was the highest first-wicket partnership for England and provided the first instance of both England openers scoring centuries in the same innings. Trescothick maintained his form in the South Africa Test matches; a career-best 219 at The Oval completed a successful series in which he averaged 60.87.

In Bangladesh, scores in the nineties against both the President&#x27;s XI and Bangladesh A were followed by a century in the first Test, and 60 in the second. He scored one half century in the three ODIs, although England only used five batsman in the comfortable victories. England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted to take control of the match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get something from the series, but was also criticised for his poor catching.

His form in the tour to the West Indies in March and April 2004 was mixed. After several low scores in the Test series—Trescothick started with only 20 runs from his first five innings—he reached two half-centuries, but failed to make a substantial match-winning contribution. This poor touring form may have been the start of the troubles that would rule him out of international cricket in the future. Trescothick said, &quot;The hardest thing for me has been the pitches. So far nets and the matches have been on average surfaces and runs have been hard work...In England you get used to good practice surfaces so the rhythm of batting comes pretty easy [sic].&quot; However, he topped the England batting averages in the 7-match one-day series, with 267 runs including 130 in the 5th ODI and 82 from 57 balls in the 7th.

Back in England, Trescothick was called upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan sustained a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick&#x27;s partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became the first player to make centuries in both innings of a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England&#x27;s best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.

===2004 and 2005 Ashes===

The 2004–5 tour of Zimbabwe caused several players to voice their concerns about the Robert Mugabe regime, the security issues in the country, and the standard of the Zimbabwean side. Steve Harmison was the first to boycott the tour for &quot;political and sporting reasons&quot;, and Flintoff was reported to be considering taking a moral stand himself. The England Chairman of Selectors David Graveney denied that the selectors would leave out players unhappy with touring Zimbabwe and would put their absences down to injury. Flintoff and Trescothick were, however, &quot;rested&quot; allowing Kevin Pietersen to make his debut.

Trescothick used the time to prepare for the following series in South Africa, even took up yoga in attempt to bolster his performances abroad. In December 2004, he made 85 not out against an N.F. Oppenheimer XI in South Africa. A partnership of 152 with Strauss in the opening Test against South Africa was followed by a partnership of 273 in the second, in which they both scored over 130. This was a record opening partnership at Durban and England&#x27;s first 200 opening stand since Gooch and Mike Atherton in 1991. Before this, the difference between his home and abroad average was over 20, and his third overseas century went a long way to counter this. With regard to his touring difficulties, Trescothick stated &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve put it to rest, but I&#x27;ve made a big step forward to putting it to rest. It&#x27;s a mental battle for me, something I have to deal with and work hard to try to understand what is different. He made a further improvement with an even larger score of 180, as England won the fourth Test. After batting slowly with Ashley Giles, the fall of Hoggard&#x27;s wicket soon afterwards spurred Trescothick to start &quot;unleashing ferocious shots&quot;, setting up an unlikely victory with Steve Harmison partnering him. In the matches preceding the 2005 Ashes series, England wrapped up two easy victories against Bangladesh. Trescothick scored 194 in the first Test, and 151 in the second. He also scored an unbeaten 100 in his 100th ODI against Bangladesh, surpassing Gooch&#x27;s record of eight ODI centuries for England.

Trescothick fared better in 2005 than in the previous Ashes series, becoming the second highest run scorer in the series (behind the prolific Kevin Pietersen). During the third Test, he became the fastest player to reach 5,000 runs in Test cricket, and also achieved the notable feat of scoring over 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year for the third consecutive year: 1,004 in 2003, 1,003 in 2004, and 1,323 in 2005. He also had the dubious honour of becoming both Glenn McGrath&#x27;s 500th and Shane Warne&#x27;s 600th Test wicket during the series. Trescothick was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his achievements in 2005, and was awarded an MBE in the 2006 New Year honours list with the rest of the English team.

For the Test series against Pakistan, Trescothick was offered the captaincy once more due to an injury to Vaughan. He was unsure whether to accept but realised that as &quot;unofficial second in command...I believe it was the right thing to step up. It is exciting to think I could be in charge for a few weeks...I know there is a chance I maybe won&#x27;t be a one-match wonder this time – it could be the whole series, but being very close to Michael, I&#x27;ve seen the things it [captaincy] does to you.&quot; As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.

==Illness and depression throughout 2006==
During England&#x27;s tour of India in February 2006, Trescothick abruptly returned home citing personal reasons. He later blamed a virus.

Trescothick returned to Test cricket in May, scoring 106 against Sri Lanka to become the first Test centurion of the 2006 English season. The century proved to be the high point of Trescothick&#x27;s Test summer, however, as he reached a half-century just once in the subsequent six Tests against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. This run of form was lifted later in the year by two ODI centuries, one apiece against Ireland and Sri Lanka. In September, he withdrew from the remaining ODIs against Pakistan and asked not to be considered for the forthcoming ICC Champions Trophy squad because of a stress-related illness. It was later believed likely that Trescothick had been suffering from clinical depression, which was also the cause of much of his trouble throughout 2006.

Returning once again to the international arena, Trescothick was included in the squad for the 2006–07 Ashes in Australia, and played in the first two tour matches against the Prime Minister&#x27;s XI and New South Wales. On 14 November, following the match against New South Wales, England announced Trescothick was flying home due to a &quot;recurrence of a stress-related illness&quot;. Geoffrey Boycott later stated that depression amongst cricketers is rarely documented, but with the current congested ICC schedule, player &quot;burnout&quot; and similar illnesses were becoming more commonplace.

Trescothick&#x27;s uncertainty over his place in the England squad drew varied criticism. However, he also received support from respected players, including Somerset captain Justin Langer, Alec Stewart, Mike Gatting, and Bob Woolmer.

==Recovery then international retirement in 2007–2008==
Trescothick ended some speculation about his international career by announcing that he would like to be considered for a place in the national side in the future. England&#x27;s management staff continued to support him, and named him in the initial 25-man squad for the 2007 Test series against the West Indies. Having recovered from a double hernia operation, and proving himself fit for the start of the county season, Trescothick began his comeback to cricket by scoring 256 from 117 balls in a 50 over match against Devon in April 2007.

His comeback to the County Championship continued with a 44-ball half-century against Middlesex on 19 April 2007, while in May he hit a career-best 284 against Northamptonshire, although Trescothick stated then that he did not feel ready for an international Test match position. Trescothick followed this double century with a knock of 76 off 35 balls against Northamptonshire, with five fours and seven sixes.

Debate over Trescothick&#x27;s place in the England squad continued amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting line-up. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, and the rise of Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: &quot;Of course I&#x27;d love to play for England again... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I&#x27;ll make myself available for England.&quot; He added that he was &quot;desperate to play for England again&quot; but was waiting until he was &quot;as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket&quot;.

In July 2007, Trescothick was named in the preliminary squad for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa, with the full squad to be confirmed on 11 August. However, Trescothick pulled himself out of the squad before the final confirmation date, stating that &quot;[I am] now clear that I should take more time to complete my recovery&quot;. The England selectors confirmed that they remained in favour of including Trescothick at some point, looking &quot;forward to his making himself available again for England when the time is right&quot;. Trescothick, however, said that he knows England cannot wait for him forever, and on 10 September 2007 he went into his second year without an England contract.
Meanwhile, his good domestic form continued with a fast 146 and 69 not out during a four-day match against Northamptonshire, giving Somerset an unlikely victory. A score of 49 from 83 balls followed in the four-day match against Nottinghamshire, and a score of 84 from 79 balls against Durham was followed by a man-of-the-match winning 124 which saw Somerset promoted to the first division of the NatWest Pro40. Of his 2007 season, Somerset director of cricket Brian Rose stated that Trescothick had made &quot;terrific progress&quot;. Trescothick maintained prolific form throughout the season despite a foot injury, scoring 1,343 runs at an average of 61.04 to guide Somerset to the Division 2 championship. He was awarded a benefit year in 2008, following on from successful surgery on an injured metatarsal. He remains firm, however, on his decision to stay out of the England team for the sake of his health.

On 15 March 2008, Somerset announced that Trescothick had decided to pull out of the county&#x27;s pre-season tour of the UAE after suffering a recurrence of his condition, leading many to speculate that, given this latest setback, it seemed increasing unlikely that Trescothick would represent England again. Somerset&#x27;s director of cricket Brian Rose, however, stated that he didn&#x27;t &quot;see the setback as a major problem&quot; and that Trescothick would be able to play for Somerset in the following season, and &quot;for many years&quot; after. He would never return to international level, however, and announced his retirement from international cricket on 22 March 2008. He stated that he had &quot;tried on numerous occasions to make it back to the international stage and it has proved a lot more difficult than [he] expected&quot; and repeated his desire to continue playing domestic cricket. He later stated that it was his decision to withdraw from Somerset&#x27;s tour of Dubai that prompted his decision.

In response, Angus Fraser wrote: &quot;Obviously, it is sad to see such a dedicated, patriotic and likeable man forced to give up something that patently meant so much to him, but the inner torment that came with attempting to overcome the mental illness that prevented him from touring with England for more than two years had to be brought to an end. It was doing Trescothick and his family no good at all. Representing your country is a source of huge pride, but there are far more important things in life&quot;. Fraser also wrote: &quot;It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick&#x27;s mental illness began to stir and the opener has not played an overseas test since&quot;.

After an excellent domestic season for Somerset, including 184 in a 40-over match against Gloucestershire (his highest List A score), Trescothick released his autobiography, &quot;Coming Back to Me&quot;, on 1 September 2008, explaining that he had suffered from anxiety attacks since the age of 10, and that playing domestic cricket meant that, at all times, he was only ever three hours away from his family. He said,

The book has been widely commended for its honesty, with Trescothick&#x27;s difficulties drawing comparison with Harold Gimblett&#x27;s similar mental health problems. Despite attempts by Pietersen to entice Trescothick back into the England set-up, Trescothick confirmed that his decision has been made and that he is putting his health and family first. In November 2008 &quot;Coming Back to Me&quot; was named the 2008 William Hill Sports Book of the Year. In April 2009, Trescothick turned down another request from new England captain Andrew Strauss to consider making himself available for England&#x27;s World Twenty20 Championship campaign.

==Later county career==
Trescothick continued his career with Somerset into 2009, having received a benefit year from his county, as well as a new stand in his name. During his benefit year he averaged 46.59 in the 4-day game, including three centuries, and he started 2009 with 52 against Warwickshire. It was also announced on 20 April 2009 that Trescothick has become a patron of Anxiety UK, following the revelations of his biography. As the season progressed, Trescothick found success in all forms of the game. On 1 June, he scored 69 from 47 balls as part of a 129-partnership with Craig Kieswetter against Glamorgan; on 3 June he scored 52 against Worcestershire; he was stumped five short of his second Championship century of the season against Lancashire; and then scored 78 against Yorkshire on 14 June. By 16 June, he had scored a hundred apiece in the Friends Provident Trophy and the County Championship, both with averages in the high 50s. On 31 July, he became the first player in the country to accrue 1,000 first-class runs in the 2009 season during the 1st innings of the County Championship match against Nottinghamshire. He also performed well in the one day arena, taking Somerset to the final of the Twenty20 championship while continuing to reject any suggestions of returning for the final Test of the 2009 Ashes series. He finished the season as the leading run scorer in the County Championship, scoring 1,817 runs. With the departure of Justin Langer, Trescothick was named as Somerset captain from 2010 onwards. 
Trescothick was also named Most Valuable Player by the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association for his 2,934 runs in all competitions in the 2009 season, 1,745 of these in the County Championship. Over the winter he starred in a short film to promote Somerset, commissioned by inward investment agency Into Somerset.

===2009 Champions League Twenty20===
With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county travelled to India to partake in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who was described as having &quot;been in sparkling form all season&quot; and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any &quot;recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006&quot;, as this was to be his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read &quot;I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple of times I have tried to go on tour it&#x27;s failed, so of course [it is a risk]... Let&#x27;s try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It&#x27;s a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen.&quot; Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, &quot;after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent&quot; according to ESPNcricinfo.

Trescothick was unable to avoid a recurrence of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same &quot;stress related illness&quot;. Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset&#x27;s defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released a statement to the media stating &quot;Marcus admitted a couple of days ago that he wasn&#x27;t 100% so that&#x27;s fair enough. I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness. I think over the next two or three years you&#x27;ll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket.&quot; Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick&#x27;s &quot;courageous&quot; decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick&#x27;s decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the &quot;Guardian&quot; also derided those critical of the Somerset player&#x27;s actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.

===Captaincy 2010 – 2015===

Trescothick led Somerset into the 2010 season as captain, and began strongly in the County Championship with a century and four half-centuries from his first eight games, though he struggled in the newly formed Clydesdale Bank 40 with only 95 runs from the first five matches, and in the Friends Provident T20 173 runs at 21.62 with a best of 50. This half century came on 25 June, where together with Kieron Pollard helped secure victory over Sussex, and was scored from 31 balls. Despite Trescothick&#x27;s four-day form, however, Somerset struggled early on, with only one victory over Yorkshire. In a Twenty20 match against Hampshire on 9 July at Taunton, Trescothick hit a half-century from 13 deliveries, including five sixes and five fours – a record fastest fifty in English domestic Twenty20 cricket. He was eventually dismissed for 78 from only 32 balls. He went on to lead Somerset to runners-up position for all three English domestic competitions, losing out to Nottinghamshire in the County Championship, Hampshire in the Twenty20 and Warwickshire in the CB40 competition.

In 2011 Trescothick started off the county championship season very strongly and was the first batsman in the country to score 1000 championship runs. He was awarded the 2011 season MVP (Most Valuable Player) award for his performances throughout the season. He ended 2011 with six centuries in the County Championship, batting with an average of 79.66 across the year. Somerset earned record financial returns that year, but again failed in the semi-final and final stages of all major competitions.

Across all three formats, Trescothick took 2,518 runs for his county. ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s George Dobell noted in their end of season round-up that &quot;He continues to dominate county attacks in a way that only Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash – of recent batsmen – could match. There are times when he makes the bowlers&#x27; job appear impossible.&quot; However, as 2012 – Trescothick&#x27;s 19th season at Somerset – approached, there was talk of resting him from the newly formed one-day cricket championship that following year. Trescothick did not travel with the rest of the side to the Champions League T20 in India. He missed part of the 2012 domestic season due to an ankle injury, and struggled for form going seven four-day matches without a half-century until passing fifty against Sussex in August and going on to score a century. By the end of the season he had played only five one day games, scoring 118 runs at 39.33, two T20 matches making only 31 runs in total, and nine County Championship games in which he scored 506 runs at 38.92, including two centuries. This was his lowest home-season aggregate since 1995. He nevertheless made a statement to the media voicing his wish to continue playing into his forties, and took up a winter commentary stint with Sky Sports to cover England&#x27;s tour of India. The 2013 season, however, found Trescothick averaging only in the mid-twenties, and failed to score a century for the first time since 1998. He remained, however, the second-highest run maker for Somerset, behind only Nick Compton,&lt;ref name=&quot;Records / 2013 - Somerset / First-class matches / Most runs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and retained the captaincy for the 2014 season. He continued to appear as a commentator and analyst for Sky Sports in the off-season, in particular during coverage of the 2014 World T20. He also publicly lent his support to England&#x27;s Jonathan Trott during the latter&#x27;s departure from the 2013–14 Ashes series, empathising with Trott&#x27;s stress-related illness in a statement to Sky Sports which recalled his own experiences, recalling that &quot;you just can&#x27;t take any more, you just can&#x27;t get through the day let alone go out there and play a Test match and win a Test match.&quot;

Trescothick began the 2014 season strongly. He scored 112 in a warm-up game against Middlesex, followed by 95 against a university team. Subsequent scores of 20, 17 and five in the next three innings prompted George Dobell of ESPNcricinfo to comment that &quot;Trescothick does not look anything like the batsman he once was,&quot; but he returned to form on 28 April with a further century against Sussex. It was his first in the County Championship since 2012, and was followed on 22 May with a second hundred, against Durham at Taunton. This century came 618 days after the last time he scored a hundred at his home ground. He passed 1,000 runs for the season on 25 September against Yorkshire, in the final game of the year&#x27;s County Championship.

In 2015, Trescothick scored over 1,000 runs for the season, including three centuries and eight 50s, and completed the milestone yet again in July 2016 against Nottinghamshire.

===Continuing career after captaincy===
In January 2016 after six seasons in the job Trescothick stood down from the Somerset captaincy to let experienced new overseas signing Chris Rogers lead the team. Trescothick finished his first season without the captaincy since retiring from England duty with a season average of over 53 and also became the Somerset cricketer with the highest number of first class catches in the history of the club. He extended his contract with Somerset for the 2017 season during which he broke the record previously belonging to Harold Gimblett for most first class centuries for Somerset and signed another 12 month extension with Somerset in August 2017, to the end of the 2018 season, his 26th season with Somerset. On 25 September 2018 Trescothick took three consecutive slip catches as Craig Overton registered a hat-trick in the county championship against Notts. It was only the third time in first-class cricket all three dismissals in a hat-trick were caught by the same non wicket-keeping fielder. On 27 June 2019 Trescothick announced that he would retire from professional cricket at the end of the 2019 season.
His last on-field appearance came as a substitute fielder in the final few minutes of Somerset&#x27;s County Championship game against Essex at Taunton on 26 September 2019. He was greeted with a standing ovation and left the field to a guard of honour from the opposition.

<text>Kim Gevaert (born 5 August 1978 in Leuven) is a former sprinter and Olympic champion from Belgium.

==Career==
Her closest brush with a world title came in running 4/100 of a second behind three-time champion Gail Devers at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. At the next World Indoor Championships, in 2006, she won the bronze medal in a national record time of 7.11 seconds.

On 9 August 2006 Gevaert won the 100 metres at the European Championships in 11.06 seconds. Two days later, she also won the final of the 200 metres, which was celebrated together with fellow Belgian athlete Tia Hellebaut, who had won gold in the high jump final only minutes before Kim Gevaert. With her first medal, Gevaert became the first Belgian gold medalist at the European Championships in 35 years and the first woman to win the sprint double since 1994.

At the 2007 World Championships she won a bronze medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay, together with teammates Hanna Mariën, Olivia Borlée and Élodie Ouédraogo. With 42.75 seconds the team set a new Belgian record. A few days earlier as best European athlete she had finished 5th in a thrilling 100 m final.

On her 30th birthday, three days before the opening of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Gevaert announced that she would retire at the end of the 2008 season.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Gevaert was in the best condition of her life. She reached the 100 m semifinals by ending 3rd in her quarterfinals, but after missing her start she finished sixth and failed to proceed to the finals. In the finals of the 4×100 m for women a couple of days later, Gevaert ran the final leg for the Belgian team and finished in second behind the Russians to bring home the silver medal in a new Belgian record of 42.54 seconds. On 16 August 2016, it was announced that the IOC had officially disqualified the Russian 4 x 100 metres relay team after Yuliya Chermoshanskaya&#x27;s re-tested samples revealed two illegal substances, awarding the gold medal to the Belgian team. She was awarded the gold medal eight years late on 10 September 2016.

On 5 September 2008, Kim Gevaert ended her career running the 100 m at the Memorial Van Damme in Brussels, Belgium, a race which she won in 11.25.

==Personal life==
Gevaert has two brothers, Marlon and John, and a sister Sigrid. Marlon competed in sprint at the national level in Belgium before becoming a national sprint coach in New Zealand. In 2010 Gevaert married her long-time partner and a fellow athlete Djeke Mambo. They have two sons and one daughter, who are bilingual, as the principal language of their father is French and of their mother is Flemish.

<doc id="873226" wikidata="Q662434" url="?curid=873226" title="Helsinki-Malmi Airport">
<text>Helsinki-Malmi Airport (, ) was an airfield that served Helsinki, the capital of Finland, located in the district of Malmi, north-north-east of the city centre. It was opened in 1936. Until the opening of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in 1952, it was the main airport of Helsinki and of Finland. After that, it was used for general aviation and flight training, and remained the second-busiest airport in Finland, as measured by the number of landings, after Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. The city of Helsinki, which owns the land the airport is located on, terminated its lease agreement for aviation purposes in December 2019, and its remaining runway was closed in March 2021, but several legal complaints are pending in courts. The city plans to use the land for the construction of approximately 25,000 new apartments starting in 2024. The airfield area, including the runways and taxiways, was opened for public recreation in February 2022.

== History ==

The first land airport of Helsinki, located in Tattarisuo in the township of Malmi, became operational in December 1936. The area is now in the district of Malmi in Helsinki. The airplanes of Aero Ltd (now Finnair) were converted from floatplanes to land-based aircraft without delay and moved to the new airport along with general aviation aircraft. The functionalist terminal building was completed in 1938 and designed by architects Dag Englund and Vera Rosendahl. The official opening ceremony took place on 15 May 1938.

Helsinki-Malmi Airport was among the first in the world to be designed from the beginning as an international airport. It made travel to and from the capital of Finland much faster than before. In the late 1930s, domestic air routes already reached all the major cities in Finland, and in 1940 it became possible to fly even to Petsamo in the far north.

The Winter War interrupted civil aviation at Malmi, and the airport was taken over by the Finnish Air Force. Civilian traffic was moved to other airfields. In the Continuation War, both civilian and military traffic used Malmi Airport. When the Continuation War ended in September 1944, the airport was taken over by the Allied Control Commission. It was returned to the supervision of the Finns at the end of 1946.

During the war, bigger and heavier aircraft had been developed, and after the war the aircraft industry and commercial aviation business flourished. Malmi Airport was confronted by a new situation. It became evident that the runways, built originally on a deep layer of clay and swampy topsoil, would require considerable investment if they were to bear the weight of the new big airliners. The problem was particularly acute with Helsinki slated to host the 1952 Summer Olympics. Cost estimates showed that extending the runways, adding pilework under them and strengthening them in other ways would be prohibitively expensive, and the plans were abandoned.

A new airfield built to international standards was first opened to traffic in 1952 in Vantaa, in time for the Olympics, today known as Helsinki Airport. Scheduled traffic gradually moved from Malmi to the new airport. Malmi Airport continued to serve a new category of commercial aviation, charter flights, for many years. In special circumstances, it also acted as a backup airfield for Helsinki Airport for lighter passenger aircraft.

After the opening of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, Malmi Airport was used mainly for general aviation. Professional flying education and professional aviation, as well as private aviation and aviation clubs, operated there. 75 to 80 percent of all flights were training flights, and in 2002, 50 percent of all pilots in Finland and two out of three professional pilots were trained there.

From the point of view of air traffic, Malmi Airport is the only free-schedule international airfield for lighter traffic within 150 km of the capital (Helsinki Airport is the only coordinated airport in Finland, i.e., it does not serve non-scheduled traffic without a runway slot application that must be filed hours in advance). In 2013, about 7,500 landings of flights between Malmi and other airfields were logged just among Malmi&#x27;s own flight operators, making Malmi the second-busiest airport for cross-country flights in Finland.

The aviation shows and other public events at the airport have typically been enjoyed by tens of thousands of spectators.

The Finnish Border Guard had its air base at the airport until the end of 2016, when the State moved all its operations elsewhere (about 14% of Malmi&#x27;s operations), anticipating the airport&#x27;s closure.

== Closure ==


The closure of the airport was debated since about 2000, as the city of Helsinki needed the area for building housing for its growing population.

On 25 March 2014, the Finnish government made a framework decision in principle to close down Malmi Airport and hand it over to residential use by the early 2020s. A prerequisite written into the government&#x27;s decision was that the Border Guard and civil aviation were to be transferred to a substitute airfield. The Border Guard moved away in 2016, but , no substituting airfield for civil aviation has been opened.

In late 2014, the Finnish state-owned airport operator Finavia Ltd sold the state&#x27;s properties on Malmi Airport to the city of Helsinki. The ownership was transferred to the city on 1 January 2017. On 31 December 2016, Finavia withdrew its services from Malmi Airport.

The city leased the airport to the Malmi Airfield Association, with a three-year lease agreement covering about 39 hectares (30%) of the airport&#x27;s area. The association operated the airport&#x27;s aviation activities. The city terminated the airport&#x27;s lease agreement for aviation purposes in December 2019. The lessee challenged the decision in court, but lost its case in District Court of Helsinki in December 2020. The lessee appealed the decision to the Helsinki Court of Appeal, and the case is still pending.

The land of the former airport has been zoned for housing, but the Malmi Airfield Association is also challenging that in court. The Association is the appellee or appellant of numerous court cases concerning the future of the airport.

The city closed the remaining runway on 14 March 2021, interrupting its aviation operations.

=== Opposition ===

The closure of the airport attracted vocal opposition from the citizenry.

The citizens&#x27; law initiative &quot;Lex Malmi&quot;, supported by more than 56,000 Finns in just two months&#x27; time and calling for keeping Malmi Airport in aviation use by means of legislation, was presented to the Finnish Parliament on 8 February 2017. The aim of the initiative was to secure the future accessibility of Helsinki and Finland by air and to save the internationally acclaimed cultural heritage site. In the end, the Speakers of Parliament prevented it from being voted on, and it was dismissed with a proclamation by the Parliament placing responsibility of proper compensatory measures for the continuation of general aviation on the State of Finland.

=== Alternative airport ===

In June 2005, the Ministry of Transport and Communications ordered the Civil Aviation Administration to formulate a new assessment of the alternatives and costs for a new general aviation airport near Helsinki. In February 2008, the Ministry of Transport and Communications commissioned an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the alternative sites. In preparing the EIA, it turned out to be problematic that neither the Ministry nor any other party had a concrete project to build a new airport. The Ministry made in early 2010 a proposal to relevant planning authorities to organise co-operation in carrying out the EIA. Based on the response, the Ministry concluded that the preparation of the EIA would not be continued without participation of the authorities responsible for land-use planning. The question of a future general aviation airport would be studied in future regional land use plans.

== Current use ==

The airport is popular among people who like outdoor exercise because its environment offers natural scenery and a nature path encircles the airport area.

On 23 and 24 July 2019, the airport hosted Ed Sheeran&#x27;s ÷ Tour for a total 108,000 attendees, setting a record for total tickets sold for two shows in Finland.

The exceptionally well preserved pre-World War II aviation milieu of Malmi Airport has also received international recognition. It has been selected to the worldwide List of 100 Most Endangered Cultural Sites 2004 by the World Monuments Fund, and re-selected to the 2006 list. The airport is also included in the Finnish selection of the international DoCoMoMo Workgroup dedicated to cataloguing and preserving buildings, monuments and sites of the modern movement. On 16 March 2016, Europe&#x27;s leading cultural heritage organization Europa Nostra and the European Investment Bank Institute selected the airport as one of the seven most endangered cultural heritage sites in Europe 2016. In 2021, 
ICOMOS brought Malmi Airport yet again into the international spotlight of international cultural heritage in its report &quot;Heritage at Risk: World Report 2016-2019 on Monuments and Sites in Danger&quot;. 

== Future ==

The city of Helsinki is planning to construct new housing on the former airport&#x27;s land for about 25,000 residents, with construction planned to start in 2024.

<doc id="873230" wikidata="Q7162804" url="?curid=873230" title="Penguin Wars">
<text>is an arcade game released in 1985 by UPL. It was ported to the original Game Boy (1990), MSX and Famicom by ASCII under the title Penguin Wars. The Game Boy version of the game is known as King of the Zoo in Europe and Penguin-Kun Wars Vs. in Japan. The main background music in most versions of the game is an electronic rendition of a song originally performed by 1980s J-Pop singer (in turn a translation of &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot; performed by Sheila E.).

== Gameplay ==
The player participates in a sport called , a pun on the Japanese pronunciation of &quot;Dodgeball&quot;. In the arcade and Famicom editions of the game, the five animals featured are the penguin, bear, panda, koala and beaver, with the penguin being controlled by the player. In the Game Boy version, the player can choose as any one of the five animals, which, in addition to the penguin, are a cow, rabbit, bat, and rat. In all versions of the game, the player plays against all the other animals. In each game, the participating animals find each other on opposite sides of a square table with five balls on each side. The object of the game is to roll those balls over the table. As soon as all ten balls are on one player&#x27;s side, that player loses the game. Each game also has a time limit of 60 seconds; if that is reached, the player with the fewest balls on their side wins.

If a player is hit by one of the balls, they are knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time. Thus, it could also be said that part of the object of the game is to hit the opponent, as otherwise it would not be possible to get all ten balls to the other side (the opponent can just roll them back before all of them have arrived).

The different animals have different strengths and weaknesses which are a trade-off with each other. For example, the rat is the one that can move left and right the fastest, but in return he can roll the balls only very slowly. The cow, on the other hand, is a very slow walker, but in return she regains consciousness more quickly.

After thirty seconds of playing, a jellybean-like obstacle appears in the middle of the table which moves left and right. Later levels have different kinds of these obstacles cause varying effects on the trajectory of the balls; some deflect them so they start rolling diagonally, whereas others simply have the ball bounce straight back.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Penguin Wars&quot; on their August 1, 1985 issue as being the fourteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

== Legacy ==
A remake of &quot;Penguin Wars&quot; for the Nintendo Switch was released in Japan on September 21, 2017, and on June 27, 2019 in North America and Europe. The PlayStation 4 version was released in January 2019.

<text>Tampere–Pirkkala Airport (; , ), or simply Tampere Airport, is located in Pirkkala, Finland, south-west of Tampere city centre. The airport is the sixth-busiest airport in Finland, as measured by the total number of passengers (168,328 in 2022), and the third-busiest as measured by the number of international passengers (159,801 in 2022). 

== History ==
===Foundation and early years===
Tampere Airport was founded in 1936 in Härmälä neighbourhood, located from the centre of Tampere. At that time the airport was connected to Helsinki, Vaasa, Oulu and Kemi by Aero O/Y (now Finnair). The first terminal building was built in 1941. Karhumäki Airways began to fly to Stockholm in the 1950s. The runway was paved in 1958. Between 1936 and 1979 Härmälä airport served 1.5 million passengers. In 1979, Härmälä airport was closed and the new Tampere–Pirkkala Airport was opened.

The current terminal 1 building was completed in 1996. Ryanair started flights to Tampere–Pirkkala in April 2003. Its first destinations were Stockholm-Skavsta, London-Stansted, Frankfurt-Hahn and Riga. This made the airport one of Finland&#x27;s fastest-growing airports and increased its annual passenger numbers from 256,380 to 709,356 between 2000 and 2008. 

===Development since 2010===
In 2011, Ryanair had 13 destinations from Tampere–Pirkkala. Wizz Air flew to Gdańsk during summers 2010 and 2011. airBaltic resumed flights to Riga in March 2017. 

The low-cost airline terminal 2 was renovated in 2014–2015. However, in April 2015, Ryanair announced that it would cancel all the routes from Tampere for the winter season 2015–16 due to a plane shortage. Then, only routes to Bremen and Budapest resumed in spring 2016. in late 2023, Ryanair terminated the route to London-Stansted, ending 20 years of service. 

On 14 December 2021, AirBaltic announced that its first secondary hub outside of the Baltic countries would be established in Tampere Airport in May 2022. In March 2023, Finnair announced it would end flights between Tampere and Helsinki Airport and replace them with bus service due to low demand and the short distance.

== Airlines and destinations ==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Tampere–Pirkkala Airport:


==Military usage==
The airport is also home to the Satakunta Air Command base of the Finnish Air Force. F-18 Hornets were stationed at Tampere-Pirkkala airport until the middle of 2014 when the 21st flight of the Satakunta Air command was dissolved.

==Statistics==


== Ground transportation ==
The airport is connected to the city centre of Tampere (25 minutes) by bus route 103, which runs a few times a day just after planes land. Bus route 34 goes to central Pirkkala once an hour during rush hours. One can transfer to a few local buses that go to other parts of Pirkkala or Nokia.

There are long-distance connections to Helsinki and other cities via the Tampere Bus Station operated by Matkahuolto.

<doc id="873250" wikidata="Q285782" url="?curid=873250" title="Glencoe, KwaZulu-Natal">
<text>Glencoe is situated in the Umzinyathi District, District of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

The main economic activity in the area is coal mining along with sheep and cattle ranching.

==History==
With coal discovered 8 km away from Dundee, an efficient way was needed to transport coal to factories other than by ox wagon. The railway from Durban to Johannesburg reached this point on 4 September 1889. A new village sprung up where a branch line was built from the Durban-Johannesburg line to the eastern Transvaal in 1903. The village was renamed Glencoe, after a mountain valley in Lochaber, Scotland, it became a town in 1934.

==Trivia==
* General French was periodically stationed here during the Second Boer War.
* Boer President Paul Kruger twice stayed overnight during the Siege of Ladysmith, South Africa. 
* The house of Carl Landman - second in command at the Battle of Blood River can be found on a farm close to Glencoe.
* Fort Mistake, a fort designed as a communications link between Ladysmith and Newcastle in 1881 and playing a key role in the Anglo-Boer War is nearby.

<doc id="873253" wikidata="Q2194512" url="?curid=873253" title="Clapham, West Sussex">
<text>Clapham is a rural village and civil parish in the Arun District of West Sussex, England. It lies on varying downslopes and escarpment of the South Downs National Park three miles (5 km) north of Angmering on the A280 road and north of the A27 crossroads. It is adjacent to the village of Patching.

==Geography==
The main part of the village is known simply as The Street, a single long dead-end road coming off the A280 and containing the majority of the village&#x27;s housing. The Street is also home to the local school and, up a slight incline into the woods, the Church of St Mary the Virgin, a 12th-century building. The houses of The Street are a combination of 1930s council houses, much older original village cottages and post-Second World War bungalows in some of the new closes.

A turn-off from the A280 a few hundred metres to the south of The Street leads into Brickworks Lane (although this name is not commonly used), named after the brickworks of the Clapham Common Brick &amp; Tile Company which was based there from the early 20th century up until the 1970s, although the quantities of clay available meant that there had been brickmaking activity on the site since the 18th century. The site of the old brickworks is now occupied by a branch of the Travis Perkins builder&#x27;s merchant&#x27;s company, and at the end of Brickworks Lane there is a West Sussex County Council highways depot.

Clapham Common itself turns off Brickworks Lane and is mostly made up of 1930s council houses. Both roads are also dead ends.

The houses of the village are surrounded mostly by fields and woodland, but the increasing encroachment of housing and road-building into the area is decreasing this green belt. Arun District Council&#x27;s local plan envisages that in the long term at least in the early 21st century Clapham and Patching will be slowly absorbed as conjoining suburbs of Durrington as more houses and retirement apartments become demanded.

==History==
Clapham is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is spelled &quot;Clopeham&quot;. The woods around the area made it an ideal location for the gathering of wood for timber and firewood, and led to the first Saxon settlements in the area.

For many years much of the land around Clapham was owned by the Dukes of Norfolk and subsequently, after a land exchange, by the Somerset family, although by the early 20th century most of the land owned by the family had been sold off or donated to the village.

==Landmarks==
Within the parish lies Clapham Wood, which is said to be haunted. The area was under the media spotlight in the 1970s due to many strange events which took place in local woodlands which became known as the Clapham Wood Mystery.

==Local Commerce==
There is one major farm in Clapham, which for many decades was operated by the tenant farmers, the Cornford family; it is now run as part of the Somerset estate. There is a village tea room and stores based in a portable cabin concreted into a corner of the recreation ground on The Street. There are also a retirement home, a kennels and a business centre. Many of the residents of working age have jobs in nearby Worthing.

==Amenities==
The village primary school was established in the early 19th century, and has occupied its current building since the 1830s, with various improvements over recent years - the school finally gained indoor toilets in 1990.

In 1976, with fewer than thirty children being educated at the school, the West Sussex Local Education Authority recommended its closure. The school was at the time the smallest in the county, but a protest by staff, pupils and parents resulted in the County Council narrowly voting against closure. The school currently educates around fifty pupils. Children of secondary school age are educated at The Angmering School in nearby Angmering.

The Village Hall, opened in 1977, is also shared with the neighbouring Patching. Previously, a smaller village hall was located on The Street in Clapham, but this was destroyed by fire. The Hall is home to many local clubs and societies, and is regularly used as a venue for Church and School fetes. For many years the green there was the home ground of Clapham &amp; Patching Cricket Club, but the club was forced to merge with the local Littlehampton club in 2000 and now plays home matches there. The village&#x27;s current premier sports team is the Short Mat Bowls club, who compete in many local competitions.

The nearest local pubs, The World&#x27;s End (formerly the Horse and Groom) and, although slightly further away for most residents, The Fox, are both located in Patching. For many years the two villages shared a local policeman who was based at a police-owned house in Patching, but this was discontinued in the late 1970s, and police from Worthing now cover the area.

<text>The British School at Athens (BSA; ) is an institute for advanced research, one of the eight British International Research Institutes supported by the British Academy, that promotes the study of Greece in all its aspects. Under UK law it is a registered educational charity, which translates to a non-profit organisation in American and Greek law. It also is one of the 19 Foreign Archaeological Institutes defined by Hellenic Law No. 3028/2002, &quot;On the Protection of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage in General,&quot; passed by the Greek Parliament in 2003. Under that law the 19 accredited foreign institutes may perform systematic excavation in Greece with the permission of the government.

The School was founded in 1886 as the fourth such institution in Greece (the earlier being the French, German, and American). For most of its existence, it focused on supporting, directing and facilitating British-based research in Classical Studies and Archaeology, but in recent years, it has broadened that focus to all areas of Greek Studies. It has made notable contributions in the fields of epigraphy and the history of Modern Greece.

It is defined by Hellenic law to be a &quot;foreign archaeological school&quot; with a very specific meaning. In addition to being trusted with antiquities in Greece, it serves as an agent for the Hellenic utilisation of British resources in Greece. Only the BSA can assign projects to British institutions, and it may only do so with permission of the Minister of Culture.

The BSA&#x27;s activities include a regular programme of lectures and seminars, a series of scholarships and bursaries, the publication of a research journal, reports, monographs and online works, Athens-based courses for undergraduates, postgraduates and teachers, as well as archaeological fieldwork. The Directors, who have included many distinguished figures, have tended to be in Greece for only part of the year, keeping roles in the UK or elsewhere.

==Facilities==
BSA facilities include one of the most important Classical and archaeological libraries in Greece (over 60,000 volumes), and the Fitch laboratory, the oldest archaeometric laboratory in Greece. The BSA also operates a branch at Knossos in Crete, including one of the island&#x27;s main archaeological libraries.

===Fitch Laboratory===
The Marc and Ismene Fitch Laboratory, Fitch Laboratory for short, is a scientific laboratory for conducting technical investigation of materials obtained from archaeology. It is located in a separate building on the grounds of the premises at 52 Souedias Street, Athens. Having begun in 1974 in a storage facility, it was expanded into a two-story building in 1988. The laboratory is funded separately from the rest of the school. It has its own director, currently (2019) Evangelia Kiriatzi, its own research scientists, teaches its own courses, offers its own grants, and issues its own publications. It is, however, governed by the main school&#x27;s Committee for Archaeology.

Fitch Laboratory was founded during a period of growing interest in establishing the provenience of pottery discovered during excavation. The method of archaeology established a sequence of layers at a site, which gave relative dates to the objects found in them; however, the method had limitations. Suppose that pottery in one region was similar to pottery at another, how was this similarity to be interpreted? Did invaders carry the pottery from one site to another? Were the similar pots trade exports? Did the pottery of one region serve as a model for the manufacture of pottery in another?

Answers to these questions were provided by the judgements of the lead excavators, but with no method of establishing provenience, these judgements were often highly controversial. For example, there are striking similarities between some Minoan and some Mycenaean pottery. Arthur Evans, Duncan Mackenzie and their supporters were proposing that Mycenaean pottery was a type of Minoan pottery. To the contrary, Carl Blegen and his supporters were affirming a mainland Greek origin for and importation to Crete of Mycenaean pottery. Given some of this pottery at a site, which was it, Minoan or Mycenaean, and how could one establish which?

By the 1960s archaeologists were turning to the chemical and physical sciences for answers. The science of geology provided them with petrology, the study of the rock composition of the clay from which the pots were made. Microscopic examination of a thin section of pot material reveals the minerals present in the grains of clay. The mineral composition of pots is then compared to the mineral composition of the rock from which various known clay beds had come. If there were any mineralic distinctions between Mycenaean and Minoan pottery, petrology would discover them.

By that time also new methods of chemical analysis of inorganic material were available, which are generally classified as &quot;activation analysis.&quot; The general method exploits two natural phenomena: the tendency to form stable atoms with a given energy structure (number and configuration of electrons and neutrons, etc.), and the action of an atom to transduce radiational energy falling on it. The input energy &quot;activates&quot; or superenergizes the atom in some way, creating an unstable configuration, which then decays, releasing the extra energy in radiation of wavelengths characteristic of the atom. A device to read the wavelengths and radiational intensities at those wavelengths then identifies the element and concentration present.

Of the three general types of activation, the mass spectrometer bombards the sample with a stream of electrons, or electrical current, until it reaches temperatures high enough to dissociate the atoms into a plasma, or cloud of superenergized ions, in which the electrons have acquired the energy to expand into unstable orbits. As the electrons fall back they lose energy as visible light. Diffraction of the light produces a spectrum that can be read electronically or captured on film. The bands of light identify the elements. Specrometers are used less frequently in archaeology as they destroy the sample; in fact, Law 3028 forbids destructive tests of artifacts.

In a second type, Neutron activation analysis (NAA), a stream of neutrons generated in a particle accelerator is directed onto the sample, forcing some of its atoms to acquire additional neutrons, generating unstable isotopes, which decay immediately, releasing gamma radiation. As in electron bombardment, the radiation emitted is of wavelengths characteristic of the element. The gamma photons are diffracted for a spectrum read-out; in addition, the half-life of the decaying isotope can be calculated, which also is characteristic and serves as an identifier. This is a popular method in ceramic elemental analysis because it is non-destructive of the sample. As it requires larger facilities, such as a particle accelerator, not present at most laboratories, the samples must be sent out.

The third method, X-ray fluorescence. a type of fluorescence, analyzes the elemental composition of solids without dissociating the atoms from the solid state. It is generally employed on the solids of art and archaeology, such as ceramics, metallic objects, paintings, and so on. In this type the sample is bombarded with x-rays or gamma rays. The electrons are energized in place without breaking up the solid matrix. Moving from the inner orbits to the outer, they fall back to the inner, giving up the induced energy as x-rays of wavelengths characteristic of the element. These are diffracted and read.

In 1960, Sinclair Hood, director of the British School, in the process of attempting to determine whether some pottery was Minoan or Mycenaean, contacted the new laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art at the University of Oxford, which was already using activation analysis. The director and assistant director of the laboratory considered the question so important that they flew immediately to Greece to obtain permission from the government to acquire and experiment on samples from 20 Theban pots. The pots were analyzed, but the analysis produced no definitive answers. Oxford and the British School continued to work together analyzing pots until in the late 1960s M.J. Aitken of the Oxford laboratory proposed that the British School initiate its own laboratory. The proposal was kept secret until the British School could obtain permission from the Hellenic Ministry of Culture with the assistance of Spyridon Marinatos, Inspector-General of the Archaeological Service. Permission obtained, the managing committee of the British School openly sought funding from the British Academy. They agreed to underwrite expenses once it was established and equipped . The Oxford laboratory offered to provide initial equipment and training. There remained a gap in the funding required to start the laboratory. The Fitches, who had helped build the stratigraphic museum at Knossos, stepped forward. The laboratory became operational in 1974.

Since 1974 the laboratory has been continually in use either for educational purposes or for conducting research. There has been no lack of funding from many private sources. The laboratory specializes in petrology and analysis of inorganic materials, especially ceramics, by x-ray fluorescence. For the petrology it has two research polarising microscopes supported by a digital photography system. The analysis is performed by a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (WD-XRF) unit, which diffracts the sample-emitted x-rays into a spectrum of different wavelengths. The laboratory&#x27;s course on ceramic petrology is standard. All samples are archived on the second floor. The archive contains about 3000 rock samples from various geological formations covering a range of clay beds, and 10,000 archaeological samples. The laboratory also collects animal bones and seeds for reference. Recognizing that research can best be performed by a pool of facilities at different laboratories, the Fitch Laboratory is part of a formal network of laboratories.

==Archaeological fieldwork==

During its long history, the BSA has been involved in a multitude of archaeological projects, including surveys in Laconia, Boeotia, Methana (Argolid), and in the islands of Ithaca (Ionian islands), Kea, Melos, Kythera (Cyclades), Chios (North Aegean) and Crete (Ayiopharango Survey, Ayios Vasilios Survey, Knossos Survey, Praisos Survey) and excavations at Nea Nikomedeia, Sitagroi, Servia and Assiros (Greek Macedonia), Lefkandi (Euboia), Emborio and Kato Phana (Chios), Perachora (Corinthia), Mycenae (Argolid), Sparta (Laconia), Phylakopi (Melos), Keros (Cyclades), as well as in Crete at Knossos, Karphi, Praisos, Debla, Trapeza Cave, Atsipades Korakias, Psychro, Myrtos, Petsofas and Palaikastro.

== Women in the BSA ==
Eugénie Sellers Strong was the first woman student to be admitted to the BSA in 1890, four years after its foundation.

Agnes Conway was admitted to the British School at Athens under Director Alan Wace for the 1913-1914 session, along with her friend Evelyn Radford with whom she had attended Newnham College, Cambridge. The trip they took to the Balkans during the session was published in 1917 as &quot;A Ride Through the Balkans: On Classic Ground with a Camera&quot;. Agnes Conway married architect-archaeologist George Horsfield in 1932.

There have been three female Directors of the BSA out of 24 in total. Rebecca Sweetman assumed the position in September 2022.

<doc id="873261" wikidata="Q5434300" url="?curid=873261" title="Fantasy Hero">
<text>Fantasy Hero is a role-playing game book originally published by Hero Games in 1985 that allows gamemasters to plan and present fantasy role-playing games using the Hero System rules. Several revised editions of the book have subsequently been published.

==Description==
&quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; uses the rules of the Hero System for character creation and combat, adapted for the fantasy genre by adding rules for magic items, spells, and fantastical creatures. The first edition published in 1985, also includes two short sample adventures, as well as rules for converting other role-playing games to &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot;.

===Magic===
The first two editions of &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; (&quot;3rd&quot; and &quot;4th&quot; edition) include a series of theme-oriented magical colleges, and a specific mechanical basis for spellcasting. In the 5th edition supplement the concept of colleges is removed, replaced by twelve different magic systems.

===Scenarios===
Three scenarios were included to give the players an idea of what an adventure involves. The first is a solo boar hunt, the second involves a local inn, and in the third, the player characters must choose to help one of two warring wizards.

==Publication history==
Hero Games originally published the superhero role-playing game &quot;Champions&quot; in 1981, using a set of rules for character creation, skills and combat that came to be known as the Hero System. This system was further refined in a second edition of &quot;Champions&quot; (1982) and again in a third edition (1985). In 1985, Hero Games released &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot;, a 160-page softcover book designed by Steve Peterson, and illustrated by Brian Hamilton, Denis Loubet, Patricia Moriarity, Scott Ruggels, Carolyn Schultz-Savoy, and Patrick Zircher, that included the Hero System without the superhero rules, but with relevant fantasy rules. As other editions were published, this edition became known as &quot;Fantasy Hero 3rd edition&quot;, since it used the 3rd edition of the Hero System rules.

About this time, Hero Games ran into financial difficulties and was taken over, becoming a subsidiary of Iron Crown Enterprises (I.C.E.). In 1990, I.C.E./Hero Games released the 4th edition of the &quot;Hero System&quot; as a stand-alone generic rules system, without the &quot;Champion&quot; superhero rules. They also published a new edition of &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot;, a 256-page softcover book that did not contain the basic Hero System rules, only the fantasy rules; this required players to have the 4th edition &quot;Hero System&quot; book in order to play &quot;Hero Fantasy&quot; games. 
In 2003 Steven S. Long designed a new edition of &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; for the 5th edition of Hero System, a 416-page softcover book.

In 2009, a new edition of &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot;, a 480-page hardcover book, was published to be paired with the new 6th Edition Hero System.

==Reception==
Phil Masters reviewed the original edition of &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #76, giving it an overall rating of 9 out of 10, but warned that &quot;This is not a game for the lazy. [...] Nonetheless, for those who want flexibility, high colour and playability, it&#x27;s probably the best thing on the market.&quot;

In Issue 9 of &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, John Woods reviewed the original edition and liked the character creation system, calling the non-random point-buy system &quot;one of the most appealing parts of the system.&quot; He concluded, &quot;This is little-known system certainly deserves more players. The rules are very clearly written and attractively presented, and the game offers wonderful opportunities for referees who are prepared either to develop their own background material or to spend a little time customising adventures intended for other systems. Well worth tracking down!&quot;

In Issue 42 of &quot;Different Worlds&quot;, Russell Grant Collins liked the universailty of the Hero System, noting that &quot;knowing how to play one of these games [by Hero Games] makes it easy to learn any of the others.&quot; Collins also liked the character generation system, calling it &quot;one of the best things about the Hero System.&quot; He did note a few issues with the combat system, since it had originally been designed for &quot;Champions&quot;, a superhero game, and the player characters in this game are slower and less powerful. However, Collins still felt this game was &quot;quite fun. I recommend it to anyone who plays other games from Hero as a primer on how to introduce magic to those systems, as well as various mythological creatures. And I recommend it to anyone wanting a fantasy system where the characters are only limited by the players&#x27; imagination (and the game master).&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan thought the ability to design one&#x27;s own magic spells was &quot;versatile, but it&#x27;s time-consuming and awkward.&quot; Swan also didn&#x27;t like that a campaign world or setting had not been included, calling the generic result &quot;pretty dull.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a below-average rating of 2 out of 4, saying, &quot;As a standalone game, it&#x27;s for completists only.&quot;

Sean Holland reviewed &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #25 (Feb./March, 1991), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Overall, I highly recommend &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; for those who like the &quot;Hero System&quot;, and if you are planning to start a new fantasy campaign and have not decided on what system to use, give &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; a look.&quot;

==Awards==
At the 2004 ENnie Awards, the 5th Edition of &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; won gold for &quot;Best Non-d20 Supplement&quot;.

<text>Ashton Court is a mansion house and estate to the west of Bristol in England. Although the estate lies mainly in North Somerset, it is owned by the City of Bristol. The mansion and stables are a Grade I listed building. Other structures on the estate are also listed.

Ashton Court has been the site of a manor house since the 11th century, and has been developed by a series of owners since then. From the 16th to 20th centuries it was owned by the Smyth family with each generation changing the house. Designs by Humphry Repton were used for the landscaping in the early 19th century. It was used as a military hospital in the First World War. In 1936 it was used as the venue for the Royal Show and, during the Second World War as an army transit camp. In 1946 the last of the Smyth family died and the house fell into disrepair before its purchase in 1959 by Bristol City Council.

The estate developed from the original deer park and is Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. It is the venue for a variety of leisure activities, including the now-defunct Ashton Court Festival, Bristol International Kite Festival and the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta. It is home to charity The Forest of Avon Trust.

==Early history==
Ashton Court dates back to before the 11th century. It is believed that a fortified manor stood on the site, given to Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, by William the Conqueror. In the Domesday Book it is referred to as a wealthy estate owned by the Bishop of Coutances, with a manor house, a great hall, and courtyards entered through gatehouses. The property passed through successive owners and at the end of the 14th century it was considerably expanded when Thomas De Lions, a nobleman originally from France, obtained a permit to enclose a park for his manor. The house was owned by the Choke family for some time. In 1506 it was sold to Sir Giles Daubeney, a knight and a Chamberlain of Henry VII. Henry VIII gave the estate to Sir Thomas Arundel in 1541 and four years later in 1545 Sir Thomas sold it to John Smyth. The Smyth family owned the property for the next 400 years. Smyth also bought the land which had been owned, until the dissolution of the monasteries, by Bath Abbey. He used the land to extend the deer park, bringing him into conflict with the residents of Whitchurch, who complained that he had used common land.

==Thomas and Florence Smyth==
Thomas Smyth (1609–1642) was the first member of the family to make major alterations and additions to the original manor house. He was a Member of Parliament and a successful lawyer. In 1627, at the age of only seventeen he married Florence daughter of John Poulett, 1st Baronet Poulett of Hinton St George.

In 1635 Thomas added a new southern front which was in the style of Inigo Jones. It was described by Collinson in 1791 in the following terms:


Further major additions were made to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John&#x27;s death halted any further work on the house. However Repton&#x27;s landscape designs were implemented by Sir John&#x27;s successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave a detailed description of the old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.

==Sir John Smyth==

As reported by Esme Smyth, Ashton Court&#x27;s last resident, Sir John Smyth (1776–1849) was responsible for the remodelling of the house. In about 1940 she was interviewed by Raymond Gorges, who was researching a book, and she gave him an engraving of the house showing the additions that she said were made by Sir John.

Sir John was a bachelor. He was said, by Lady Emily Smyth, to be devoted to horses and kept an extensive stud. His importance as a major builder of Ashton Court is verified by John Evans who in 1828 wrote a book about Bristol and its surrounding area. He said:

==Sir Greville and Lady Emily Smyth==

Sir Greville Smyth inherited the property in 1852 and remained a bachelor until he was 48 years old. During that time he undertook extensive renovations. He also kept a very impressive garden which was described in detail in gardening magazines and newspapers.

In 1872 he commissioned the well-known architect Benjamin Ferrey to make additions which were described as follows.

Even more extensive alterations were made between 1884 and 1885. Shortly before he married Emily, the widow of George Oldham Edwards, he employed the notable Bath architect Major Charles Edward Davis to transform the house. The work took 18 months to complete. A detailed description of the alterations was given in the &quot;Bristol Mercury&quot;. in 1885. He converted the stables in the south east wing to living areas which included a huge museum for his natural history collection. He built a grand hall with richly carved oak panels. In the west wing he built a massive carved oak staircase with twist bannisters and introduced perpendicular windows. He also built a winter garden by enclosing the clock court. This is now the Winter Garden Bar. The following description of this elaborate room with a waterfall fountain is given in this newspaper article as follows:

Also in the 1880s of formal gardens were laid out including a terrace garden, which is now a lawn, a wilderness garden with basin fountain and a rose garden. Avenues of sequoias and cedars were planted along with other specimen trees.

In 1891 Lady Emily Smyth held an interview where she outlined further details of these alterations made by Sir Greville. She also gave a few details of some interesting secret rooms and passages in the medieval part of the building on the western side which she referred to as &quot;Drax&#x27;s Kennel&quot; and &quot;The Fox&#x27;s Hole&quot;. Sir Greville Smyth died in 1901 and Lady Emily Smyth died in 1914.

The next and last residents of the house were Gilbert and Esme Smyth. They lived there for the next thirty years. Gilbert died in 1940 and Esme in 1946 and the house was left to their daughter Esme Francis Cavendish. She and her husband tried to sell the house immediately in 1946 to help pay the death duties. However the Cavendish family did not succeed until thirteen years later in 1959 during which time the house was unoccupied and started to decay. It was sold at this time to Bristol City Council who still owns it today.

==Archives==
Archives of the Ashton Court estate (including estate management and estate office papers) and personal papers of the Smyth family are held by Bristol Archives (Ref. AC) (online catalogue). Bristol Archives also holds photos and papers about the redevelopment of Ashton Court mansion and stables (Ref. 43326) (online catalogue) and (Ref. 45390) (online catalogue). Other records relating to the Ashton Court estate are also held by Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre and the University of Bristol Special Collections.

==Architecture==
Due to successive remodellings and enlargements the architecture at Ashton Court is complex and seldom what it seems. The core of the house, a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which have in turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the plan of the house has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; while the majority of the house was built in the 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration has created an overall Gothic appearance.

In the early 19th century, the house was given a long facade in an attempt to provide some uniformity and some classical grandeur. However even here, the architecture does not remain faithful to a single style. At the centre of this facade is a much altered Tudor gatehouse, probably built in the 16th century as a portal to the 14th-century manor house. In order to create the long facade, the existing stables, to the right of the gatehouse, were converted to domestic use and given seven bays of Gothic mullioned windows. To the left of the gatehouse, the flanking south-west wing is of a different style.

This classically designed wing has been attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d&#x27;Evercy, also in Somerset, it seems to be based solely on the alternating segmental and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and ignoring the irregularities in their spacings and placings, which Jones is unlikely to have countenanced.

To give the long facade with its two wings of contrasting architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval windows of the left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean balustrade was repeated above the Gothic right-hand wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use of castellations instead of a balustrade on the right-hand side. Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The focal point of the facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting to the ceiling of the passage leading, not to a great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).

The north wing was included in the remodelling work of 1805 and given ogee headed windows in the delicate Strawberry Hill Gothic style, popular at turn of the 19th century; it was a forerunner of the more medieval ecclesiastical Gothic style that was to characterise the architecture of the 19th century, and employed at Ashton Court during the 1885 alterations.

==Recent history==

During the First World War the estate was used as a military hospital, and in the Second World War was requisitioned by the War Office and used in turn as a transit camp, RAF HQ and US Army Command HQ. The estate was the venue for the 1936 Royal Show. One of the exhibition buildings, despite its temporary nature, was an innovative piece of modernist architecture still remembered as the Gane Pavilion. It was designed by Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer as a show house for the Bristol furniture manufacturer Crofton Gane. For most of the 20th century Ashton Court was the venue for the North Somerset Show, however this is now held in Wraxall.

In 1946, the last resident of Ashton Court Dame Esme Smyth, died. After the house became derelict, it was taken over by the City in 1959. Restoration has been an ongoing process since then, but even after extensive investment by both the council and from Heritage Lottery Fund grants, presently only about a quarter of the building is occupied or usable. The available facilities of the house are rented out for business conferences, parties and weddings. In 2013 a fire damaged the northern wing. It was contained by Avon Fire and Rescue Service, otherwise the rest of the building would have been at risk.

Between 1974 and 2007 the Ashton Court Festival was held in the grounds of the estate. The festival was a weekend event which featured a variety of local bands and national headliners. Mainly aimed at local residents, the festival did not have overnight camping facilities and was financed by donations and benefit gigs.

Starting as a small one-day festival in 1974, the festival grew during succeeding years and was said to be Britain&#x27;s largest free festival until changes brought on by government legislation resulted in compulsory fees and security fencing being introduced. After problems were caused by a temporary move to Hengrove Park in 2001, due to the foot and mouth crisis, and a washout in 2007, the organisers declared bankruptcy in 2007.

The mansion house and stables have been designated by Historic England as a Grade I listed building. The house is listed on the Heritage at Risk Register and described as being in &quot;slow decay&quot;. The lower lodge to Ashton Court and attached gates, railings and bollards, which were built in 1805 by Henry Wood, are Grade II* listed buildings. The lower lodge was fully refurbished in 2016 with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and is now named Ashton Gatehouse. The building is now a heritage site managed by Ashton Park School. The garden and perimeter walls and railings are also listed.

Since 2018, the mansion house has been managed by Bristol charity Artspace Lifespace, allowing the building to be open to the public for a variety of events.

==Location and surroundings==
The house stands within a large estate spanning the boundary between Bristol and North Somerset, approximately from the city centre. It is on the western side of the River Avon close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the suburb of Leigh Woods and the Leigh Woods National Nature Reserve which are east of Ashton Court. To the north and west is open countryside. The estate was previously much larger than it is today and included areas which are now suburbs of Bristol including Ashton Gate, Ashton Vale and Southville where the Greville Smyth Park is located. The land for the park was donated by the Smyth family and then landscaped by the city council.

The estate covers of woods and open grassland laid out by Humphry Repton. It includes two pitch-and-putt golf courses, a disc golf course, an orienteering course and horse riding and mountain bike trails. Bristol&#x27;s weekly parkrun event (a free, timed 5 km run organised by volunteers) is held at Ashton Court.

There is a deer park which was started in the 14th century and extended in the 16th and 17th centuries. There are still two areas of the estate with deer enclosures. The park contains a great variety of wildlife; much of the site (an area of 210.31 hectares) was notified in 1998 as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the presence of rare woodland beetles including: &quot;Ctesias serra&quot;, &quot;Phloiotrya vaudoueri&quot; and &quot;Eledona agricola&quot;.

The 2.37 hectares of Ashton Court Meadow is managed as a nature reserve by the Avon Wildlife Trust. It contains a wide range of flowering plants, including wild carrot, yellow-wort and field scabious. Some unusual parasitic plants are also found here, such as common broomrape which feeds off clovers, and yellow rattle, which feeds partly off grass.

Clarken Combe, at the western edge of the estate, is a woodland area with a range of plant species, including narrow-lipped helleborine, which grows here in small numbers under beech.

In 2002 a 700-year-old oak tree, called the Domesday Oak, was selected by The Tree Council as one of 50 Great British Trees. In 2011 a crack appeared in the trunk and oak support beams were fitted to support the tree. The supports were only partly successful and a section of the tree collapsed; the remaining part of the tree was pruned to reduce the weight of the surviving section.

<doc id="873265" wikidata="Q4924155" url="?curid=873265" title="Death of Blair Peach">
<text>Clement Blair Peach (25 March 1946 – 24 April 1979) was a New Zealand teacher who was killed during an anti-racism demonstration in Southall, London, England. A campaigner and activist against the far right, in April 1979 Peach took part in an Anti-Nazi League demonstration in Southall against a National Front election meeting in the town hall and was hit on the head, probably by a member of the Special Patrol Group (SPG), a specialist unit within the Metropolitan Police Service. He died in hospital that night.

An investigation by Commander John Cass of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Complaints Investigation Bureau concluded that Peach had been killed by one of six SPG officers, and others had preserved their silence to obstruct his investigation. The report was not released to the public, but was available to John Burton, the coroner who conducted the inquest; excerpts from a leaked copy were also published in &quot;The Leveller&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in early 1980. In May 1980 the jury in the inquest arrived at a verdict of death by misadventure, although press and some pressure groups—notably the National Council for Civil Liberties—expressed concern that no clear answers had been provided, and at the way Burton conducted the inquest.

Celia Stubbs, Peach&#x27;s partner, campaigned for the Cass report to be released and for a full public inquiry. An inquiry was rejected, but in 1988 the Metropolitan Police paid £75,000 compensation to Peach&#x27;s family. In 2009 Ian Tomlinson died after he was struck from behind by a member of the Territorial Support Group, the SPG&#x27;s successor organisation; the parallels in the deaths proved to be the catalyst in the release of the Cass report to the public. The Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, released the report and supporting documentation. He also offered an official apology to Peach&#x27;s family.

The policing of the demonstration in Southall damaged community relations in the area. Since Peach&#x27;s death the Metropolitan Police have been involved in a series of incidents and poorly conducted investigations—the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, the death of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005, the botched 2006 Forest Gate raid and the death of Tomlinson—all of which tarnished the image of the service. Peach&#x27;s death has been remembered in the music of the Pop Group, Ralph McTell and Linton Kwesi Johnson; the National Union of Teachers set up the Blair Peach Award for work for equality and diversity issues and a school in Southall is named after him.
==Background==
===Blair Peach===
Clement Blair Peach was born in Napier, New Zealand, on 25 March 1946, to Clement and Janet Peach. He was one of three brothers, the others being Roy and Philip; the former was a solicitor and led the family&#x27;s legal campaign after Blair&#x27;s death. Blair was schooled at Colenso College, then studied education and psychology at the Victoria University of Wellington, where he co-edited the &quot;Argot&quot; literary magazine with his flatmate Dennis List and David Rutherford. During his studies Peach visited Britain and liked the country. After graduating he was employed in several temporary jobs, but was turned down for compulsory military training for having an &quot;unsuitable character&quot;. He emigrated to Britain in 1969 and was soon employed as a teacher at the Phoenix special needs school in Bow, east London. In 1970 he entered a long-term relationship with Celia Stubbs; they had first met in New Zealand in 1963 when she was visiting the country. Peach helped raise Stubbs&#x27;s two daughters from her previous relationship, and the couple regarded each other as husband and wife.

Peach was politically active and joined the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (SWP), Socialist Teachers&#x27; Association and the local branch of the National Union of Teachers. He was also a committed opponent of racism and was active in the Anti-Nazi League. He had been arrested previously when campaigning on political issues, and in 1974 he was charged with threatening behaviour after challenging a local publican&#x27;s refusal to serve black customers; he was acquitted.

===Southall===

As a result of the population transfers after the 1947 partition of India over ten million people were impoverished. From the late 1950s a significant number of them relocated. Many Sikhs and Hindus left the subcontinent to settle in Greater London, particularly Southall, where shortages of workers at factories, and the employment prospects at nearby Heathrow Airport meant jobs were easily obtainable. Some of the early arrivals found work at the R. Woolf and Co Rubber factory; by 1965 all the lower level workers were from Poland or the Indian subcontinent. Racial discrimination in the workplace was common; 85 per cent of those Asian workers who had been given entry into the UK on the basis of their education or training were employed only in unskilled or semi-skilled roles. Kennetta Hammond Perry, in her history of post-war immigration, identifies the reasons as being &quot;in part because of perceptions about their level of competence and stereotypes about their ability to speak English&quot;. Indian workers also faced discrimination from the white-dominated trade unions, and so formed their own organisation, the Indian Workers&#x27; Association (IWA).

During local elections of the 1960s anti-immigration rhetoric was used by some candidates, successfully in many cases. Smaller right-wing parties used immigration as a platform on which to stand, including in Southall. In the local elections of May 1964, the anti-immigration British National Party (BNP) polled 15 per cent of the vote in Southall; in the general election that October the BNP leader, John Bean, received 9.1 per cent in the Southall constituency. Bean won 7.4 per cent of the vote at the 1966 general election. The BNP&#x27;s successor, the National Front, recorded 4.4 per cent of the vote at the 1970 general election.

In June 1976 the racist murder of Gurdip Singh Chaggar in Southall—outside the offices of the IWA—led to the former chairman of the National Front, John Kingsley Read, stating &quot;one down, a million to go&quot;. Chaggar&#x27;s murder led to the formation of the Southall Youth Movement (SYM) to challenge the rise in racism and attacks from the National Front. Rioting in the area took place between police and Asian youths and members of Peoples Unite, a similar group to the SYM, but consisting of young Afro-Caribbeans.

===Special Patrol Group===
The Special Patrol Group (SPG) was formed in 1961 as a specialist squad within the Metropolitan Police. It provided a mobile, centrally controlled reserve of uniformed officers which supported local areas, particularly when policing serious crime and civil disturbances. The SPG comprised police officers capable of working as disciplined teams preventing public disorder, targeting areas of serious crime, carrying out stop and searches, or providing a response to terrorist threats. In 1978 there were 1,347 SPG members in forces across the UK, 204 of them in the Metropolitan Police Service. They were divided into six units, each of which contained three sergeants and 30 constables. Each unit was commanded by an inspector.

The use of the SPG proved controversial to some. It was involved in the Red Lion Square disorders, when Kevin Gately, a student demonstrating against a National Front march, was killed from a blow to the head from a blunt instrument; the perpetrator was never identified. Accusations were made that the police were inappropriately violent towards those demonstrating. The former chief constable, Tim Brain, writes &quot;their critics viewed them with suspicion as a force within a force&quot;; the Metropolitan Police history observes that &quot;their presence sometimes came to assume unwanted symbolic significance&quot;. The former chief constable Geoffrey Dear states that the SPG &quot;might apparently solve one problem but in its wake create another of aggravated relationships between minority groups and the police in general&quot;.

The SPG was disbanded in 1986 and, replaced by District Support Units (DSU). After receiving bad press, the DSU were replaced by the Territorial Support Group in January 1987.

==23 April 1979==

In the run-up to the 1979 general election, the National Front announced that it would hold a meeting at Southall Town Hall on 23 April 1979, St George&#x27;s Day. Southall was to be one of 300 parliamentary seats for which the organisation put up candidates. Prior to the Southall meeting, similar events had resulted in clashes with anti-racist protesters, including in Islington, north London, on 22 April, and in Leicester the following day. At both events, police had been injured trying to keep the two sides separate.

A petition of 10,000 residents was raised to cancel the meeting, but to no effect. Ealing Council had blocked previous meetings by the National Front, but, under the Representation of the People Act 1969, they allowed the party to use the hall. The day before the meeting a march by the IWA was planned from central Southall, past the town hall, and ending at Ealing Town Hall. Approximately 1,200 police officers were on duty along the five-mile (eight-kilometre) route; 19 people were arrested. Two counter-demonstrations for the day of the meeting were planned: a picket on the pavement opposite the hall, and a seated demonstration outside it. To deal with the potential violence, 2,876 police officers were drafted in, 94 of whom were on horseback; they arrived at 11:30am and demonstrators began gathering at 1:00pm in preparation for the 7:30pm National Front meeting.
The number of demonstrators at the town hall rose, and included some whom the police considered militant elements. There were some clashes between police and protesters and a small number of arrests ensued. The police decided to establish a sterile cordon around the town hall, although they still allowed a small, contained demonstration in the High Street. Cordons were set up on Lady Margaret Road, the Broadway, High Street and South Road. Between 2:30 and 3:15pm, at the High Street cordon, missiles were thrown at the police, who used riot shields to contain the crowd.

According to the official police report, between 5:30 and 6:30pm the level of violence rose as the crowd at the High Street cordon again began to throw missiles and at about 6:20pm between 500 and 2,000 protesters tried to breach the police lines. In response, mounted officers were brought in to disperse the crowd. The author Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, who was present at the demonstration, thought the mood changed when the police tactics changed from containment to dispersement, which triggered the missile-throwing reaction from the crowd.

A house on Park View Road, the headquarters of Peoples Unite, was used as a first aid post. The official police report states that the residents were &quot;a group of mainly Rastafarians&quot; who were squatting at the premises, and that these occupants threw missiles from the house at police in the street. SPG officers entered the house and an altercation broke out in which two officers were stabbed. Those in the house—including those manning the first aid post and those receiving treatment—were beaten with truncheons, and an estimated £10,000 of damage was done to the contents of the house, including the equipment for the band Misty in Roots; the group&#x27;s manager, Clarence Baker, went into a coma for five months after his skull was fractured by a police truncheon. All those inside were removed from the property, regardless of what they were doing, and there were subsequent complaints by the inhabitants of racist and sexist abuse by the police. Seventy people were arrested either at or near the address. At the trial of one of those arrested, one of the SPG officers involved reported &quot;there was no overall direction of the police forces at this time&quot; and the situation was &quot;a free for all&quot;.

National Front members began arriving from 7:00pm. At its scheduled time their meeting took place. During the assembly, one of the organisation&#x27;s speakers called for &quot;the bulldozing of Southall and its replacement by a &#x27;peaceful English hamlet. Four members of the public were allowed into the hall to fulfil the requirements of the Representation of the People Act, but a journalist from &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; was stopped from entering because the newspaper was considered to be &quot;nigger loving&quot;. When the meeting ended at about 10:00pm, some of the attendees gave Nazi salutes on the steps of the town hall before being escorted to safety by the police.
Once the meeting was underway, the police decided to clear the area of demonstrators and allowed them to pass along the Broadway towards the crossroads with Northcote Avenue and Beachcroft Avenue. At about 7:30pm Peach, with four friends, decided to return to their cars and moved towards the junction. The group had been on the Broadway since they arrived in the area at 4:45pm. At around the same time a flare or petrol bomb was thrown either at or over a police coach on the Broadway. The driver—with a policeman standing next to him—drove the coach through the crowd; no-one was injured, but eyewitnesses said that the mood of the crowd changed at that point. Two SPG vans drove westwards along the Broadway and collected two crates of bricks and bottles that the crowd left behind as they retreated. Items were thrown at the two vehicles and a police inspector on a building roof radioed to the central control unit that there was a riot in progress.

Peach and his friends turned off the Broadway down Beachcroft Avenue, thinking they were heading out of the area, but not realising the road only connected to Orchard Avenue, which led back to The Broadway and the heavy police cordon there. There was a group of 100 to 150 protesters on the corner of the Broadway and Beachcroft Avenue and the SPG vans of Unit 3 drove to the junction of the Broadway with Northcote Avenue and Beachcroft Avenue to face them. As the officers deployed out of the vehicles they were hit by missiles from the crowd. One officer was hit in the face by a brick which fractured his jaw in three places. The inspector leading the unit radioed &quot;Immediate assistance required&quot;.

The official investigation into Peach&#x27;s death states that the events leading up to this point, while difficult, were relatively straightforward, but that &quot;further description of what happened&quot; is hampered by &quot;conflicting accounts [that] have been given by private persons and also by police&quot;. The radio call from Unit 3 was picked up by SPG Unit 1, two of whose vans drove into Beachcroft Avenue from the Broadway entrance and stopped at the corner with Orchard Avenue. They deployed while under bombardment from bricks and stones. The first person to exit the van was Inspector Alan Murray, who had charge of the first van of Unit 1 (called Unit 1-1), and was followed by constables Bint, White, Freestone, Richardson and Scottow. Murray and his men were using riot shields, had their truncheons drawn and worked to disperse the crowd. During this action Peach received a blow on the head. Fourteen witnesses stated that they saw it happen and said that it was a police officer who struck the blow. One resident told the inquest that she:

saw blue vans coming down Beachcroft Avenue. They were coming very fast—as they came round Beachcroft Avenue, they stopped. I saw policemen with shields come out—people started running and the police tried to disperse them. I saw police hitting. I saw a white man standing there ... The police were hitting everybody. People started running, some in the alley, some in my house ... I saw Peach, I then saw the policeman with the shield attack Peach.

Peach was taken into a nearby house—71 Orchard Avenue—after one of the residents saw him being hit. He was given a glass of water, but could not hold it. His eyes were rolled up to the top of his head and he had difficulty speaking. The residents soon called an ambulance, which was logged at 8:12pm; it arrived within ten minutes, and Peach was taken to Ealing Hospital. He was promptly operated on because of a large extradural haematoma but his condition worsened through the procedure. He died at 12:10am on 24 April.

There were 3,000 protesters in Southall on 23 April. The police arrested 345 people. Ninety-seven police were injured, as were 39 of the prisoners; 25 members of the public were also injured, of whom Peach was one. A member of the National Front was found near Southall train station, badly beaten. He spent two days in intensive care before being released.

==Aftermath==
Within a day of Peach&#x27;s death, Commander John Cass of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Complaints Investigation Bureau began an investigation of the events and statements were taken from members of the SPG that day. Sir David McNee, then the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, also undertook his own eight-day review of the demonstrations, although he did not include Peach&#x27;s death as part of his analysis.

The inquest opened on 26 April 1979; John Burton, the coroner for West London, oversaw the proceedings. On the opening day he allowed Peach&#x27;s family to have a second post-mortem examination undertaken by an independent pathologist; the inquest was then adjourned for a month. It reconvened on 25 May 1979 and was again adjourned after Cass appeared as a witness and said that his investigation would take between two and three months more. By that time, he and his team had interviewed 400 people. Burton said that the inquiry would reconvene after Sir Tony Hetherington, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), had been given the report.
Despite statements by the police and the incumbent government that the trouble at Southall was caused by outsiders to the area, only 2 of the 342 charged were non-residents of Southall. Instead of holding the trials locally, they were held away in Barnet. Lalith de Kauwe, writing for &quot;Bulletin&quot;—the publication of the Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers—writes that while initially 90 per cent of the defendants were found guilty, this dropped to 70 per cent once the press began to publicise the matter.

On 12 June 1979 Peach&#x27;s body was laid out at the Dominion Cinema in Southall; 8,000 people filed past it. The following day he was buried at East London Cemetery, where between 5,000 and 10,000 people were in attendance. Three days after the funeral, McNee defended the actions of the SPG and told a black reporter &quot;I understand the concern of your people. But if you keep off the streets of London and behave yourselves you won&#x27;t have the SPG to worry about.&quot;

===Cass investigation===
One member of SPG Unit 1-1 was questioned by Cass&#x27;s team in early June 1979 after the forensic report stated that Peach was probably not killed by a police truncheon, but by a lead-filled cosh or pipe. A search of the unit&#x27;s lockers found 26 weapons—including police truncheons—many of which were unauthorised, including coshes and knives, as well as sets of keys and a stolen driving licence. Cass&#x27;s team raided the home of PC Grenville Bint, where weapons and Nazi memorabilia were found. Bint stated he collected the memorabilia as a hobby.

During his investigation Cass held several identification parades, including for Officer F, Officer G and Officer I. These were identified by the barrister and historian David Renton from the inquest as PCs Raymond White, James Scottow and Anthony Richardson, respectively. No witness managed to identify the man they saw hitting Peach. It later transpired that one officer present at the riots shaved off the moustache which he had that day, while Inspector Murray grew a beard and refused to take part in the identity parades. Many of the uniforms that the police wore that day had been dry-cleaned before they were inspected. Cass ran up against misleading stories from the members of Unit 1-1 and in his report he stated &quot;The attitude and untruthfulness of some of the officers involved is a contributory factor.&quot; He continued &quot;The action of these officers clearly obstructed the police officers carrying out their duty of investigating this serious matter.&quot; Cass decided that he had identified the individual whom he considered most likely to have hit Peach, but that there was &quot;no evidence of a conclusive nature&quot;:

The officers in that carrier after disembarking, who could have assaulted Clement Blair PEACH were Officer E, Officer H, Officer G, Officer I, Officer J and Officer F, and I give them in that order of possibility.

Renton identified these officers as Murray, Bint, Scottow, Richardson, Freestone and White, respectively. Cass&#x27;s report was accepted by the police as being accurate, and in his 1983 autobiography McNee wrote &quot;when all the evidence was assembled it showed that Blair Peach had died from a blow to his skull. The evidence pointed to the fact that the blow had been struck by a police officer.&quot;

===Coroner&#x27;s inquest===
Cass finished the investigation in February 1980; 30 investigators had worked for 31,000 man-hours during his enquiries. He finished his initial report on 12 July 1979, which was sent to the DPP, who, while praising the work he had done, stated that &quot;there was insufficient evidence to justify a prosecution&quot;. The inquest reopened a week later. Both Burton and the lawyers representing the Metropolitan Police were given copies of Cass&#x27;s report, but refused to provide copies to the lawyers representing the Peach family or those representing the Anti-Nazi League. Burton used Cass&#x27;s report to determine which witnesses to call and which to ignore. Michael Dummett, Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford University, examining the case for the National Council for Civil Liberties, observes that as only the coroner and police lawyers had copies of the report, &quot;it was impossible for anyone ... [else] to obtain a complete picture of the evidence&quot;. The question of whether the family were allowed to view the reports was taken to a Divisional Court, who ruled that as the report was the property of the police, they had the right to withhold it.

Legal counsel for the Peach family requested that the inquest be held in front of a jury, which Burton rejected; the inquest was again adjourned. The High Court rejected a challenge to overturn Burton&#x27;s decision, which then went to the Court of Appeal where Lord Denning stated that the inquest should reconvene in front of a jury.

In early 1980 sections of the Cass report were published in &quot;The Leveller&quot; (January 1980) and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (March 1980). Details included in both publications were the names of Murray, White, Freestone, Richardson and Scottow. The latter publication indicated that the decision by the DPP not to prosecute the policemen &quot;left the investigating officers in the invidious position of appearing party to a cover-up, should their report ever become public&quot;. In April 1980—the one-year anniversary of Peach&#x27;s death—members of the group &quot;Friends of Blair Peach Committee&quot; picketed outside police stations holding posters that named the six members of SPG Unit 1-1 and the words &quot;Wanted for the murder of Blair Peach&quot;.

The inquest reconvened on 28 April 1980 and was expected to last several weeks. Both pathologists—David Bowen for the coroner and Keith Mant acting for the family—came to the same conclusions: that death was from a single blow, not a police truncheon, but a &quot;rubber &#x27;cosh&#x27; or hosepipe filled with lead shot, or some like weapon&quot;. Both stated that Peach had a thin skull, but not, as Mant observed, &quot;pathologically thin&quot;. He described the action that caused the injury as &quot;a very severe, single blow&quot;.

The inquest closed on 27 May 1980 during which time 83 witnesses were called. A verdict of death by misadventure was given. The criminologists Phil Scraton and Paul Gordon consider that, given the conclusions of the Cass report, unlawful killing would have been a more appropriate verdict. In its leader the following day, &quot;The Times&quot; said that &quot;the Peach inquest failed to provide a clear and believable explanation of the events in question&quot;; it also stated that Peach&#x27;s death should continue to be investigated.

The National Council for Civil Liberties expressed concern at the way Burton conducted the inquest. The organisation felt uneasy with a theory that he put to the jury: that Peach was killed by &quot;some political fanatic&quot; in order to make him a martyr against the police. During the course of the inquest, Burton wrote to ministers to say that the question of whether Peach was killed by a police officer was a &quot;political &#x27;fabrication. He also wrote to the home secretary, lord chancellor and attorney general, claiming that there was a conspiracy to spread false information about Peach&#x27;s death; he accused several media outlets, including the BBC, of producing what he described as &quot;biased propaganda&quot;. In 2010 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; considered that Burton had shown a &quot;lack of sympathy ... towards Mr Peach&#x27;s death&quot;.

After the inquest Burton wrote a seven-page article entitled &quot;The Blair Peach Inquest – the Unpublished Story&quot;, which he wanted to publish in the Coroners&#x27; Society annual report. In the article, he said that some civilian witnesses lied and were &quot;totally politically committed to the Socialist Workers Party&quot;, and he thought that some of the Sikh witnesses &quot;did not have experience of the English system&quot; to give reliable evidence. He was persuaded not to publish the account by civil servants, who considered that the report would &quot;discredit the impartiality of coroners in general and Dr Burton in particular&quot;.

==Subsequent events==
There were several calls for a public inquiry to examine the circumstances surrounding Peach&#x27;s death and the role of the police; 79 MPs supported such a hearing, but the government refused to hold such a review. The Peach family also challenged the Metropolitan Police in court for the Cass report and supporting papers to be released. In February 1986 the Court of Appeal ruled that the police should release the statements and supporting papers, but not the report itself. The family also sought to claim damages from the Metropolitan Police and in June 1988, after eight years of trying, they were awarded £75,000. The political historian Mick Ryan observes that the Peach case is an example where &quot;compensation is ... paid in tacit admission that a wrong had been committed&quot;. In April 1999 Paul Boateng, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, was the final minister who turned down the request for a public inquiry, saying the event had happened too long ago to be beneficial.

Following correspondence with the Peach family at the time of the twentieth anniversary of Peach&#x27;s death, Commander Ian Quinn of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s complaints bureau undertook a review of investigation in 1999. The family were not told of the investigation or its outcome.

On 1 April 2009, at the 2009 G20 London summit protests, a member of the Territorial Support Group, the SPG&#x27;s successor organisation, struck Ian Tomlinson, a newspaper vendor, who collapsed and died. The parallels in the deaths of the two men proved to be the catalyst in the release of the Cass report to the public. Stephenson also officially apologised to Peach&#x27;s family. That June the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson announced that Cass&#x27;s report and supporting documentation would be released.

===SPG Unit 1-1===
After Stephenson&#x27;s announcement that the Metropolitan police would publish the Cass report, Murray stated that he believed he was the officer referred to in the report as &quot;Officer E&quot;, but said that &quot;Under no circumstances was I involved in the death of Blair Peach. I was not involved in his death. I&#x27;m as certain as I can be.&quot; Murray considered Cass&#x27;s report to be &quot;pure fabrication to justify his failure to identify the perpetrator of this act&quot;. Angered at the handling of the initial investigation, Murray left the police and joined his brother&#x27;s jewellery business in Scotland before becoming a lecturer in corporate responsibility at the University of Sheffield.

Two days after the Nazi memorabilia and unauthorised weapons were found in his possession, Bint was transferred out of the SPG. Richardson and Freestone were transferred out soon afterwards; Scottow and White voluntarily transferred. All the officers left the police force shortly after the investigation ended.

===Undercover Policing Inquiry===
In 2021 evidence was provided to the Undercover Policing Inquiry that the Metropolitan Police monitored Stubbs with undercover officers for about twenty years. This included taking photographs at Peach&#x27;s funeral and creating an attendee list report, and monitoring the 20th anniversary event planning in 1998.

==Impact==

Following the actions of the police at Southall, the Asian community in the area felt that relations between them and the police had broken down; many saw the police as aggressors. One member of the community said &quot;Our feeling now towards the police is one of shock. In India the police are very brutal, but none of us believed until Monday night that the police here could behave equally brutally.&quot; The journalists Mark Hughes and Cahal Milmo consider that the action of the SPG &quot;became a symbol of police corruption&quot;.

Writing after the release of the Cass report, the leader in &quot;The Times&quot; opined that following Peach&#x27;s death, &quot;the Metropolitan Police entered a dark place from which they have been struggling to emerge ever since&quot;. In 2010 Andy Hayman, the former assistant commissioner for Specialist Operations at the Metropolitan Police, wrote that Peach&#x27;s death brought the service and the SPG into disrepute. It led to an undermining of confidence in the police and &quot;creat[ed] a distrust of officers that in some quarters, has proved difficult to shake off&quot;. The criminologists Chris Greer and Eugene McLaughlin considered Peach&#x27;s death alongside the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s actions in relation to the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, the death of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005, the botched 2006 Forest Gate raid and the death of Ian Tomlinson; they described the &quot;succession of institutional scandals, cover-ups and botched investigations&quot; that had tarnished the image of the service. Writing in the light of Tomlinson&#x27;s death, Philip Johnston, a journalist with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, observed that Peach was one in a number of incidents where there had been unwarranted police aggression. Johnston wrote that while at the time of Peach&#x27;s death many people would have sided with the police, that is no longer the case. &quot;Many of those from the countryside who attended the Westminster rally against the ban on fox-hunting bear the scars of a brutal confrontation with the police, which changed their view of them for ever.&quot;

==Legacy==

Public reaction to Peach&#x27;s death, and other underlying racial tensions including excessive police use of the sus law, ultimately led to the 1981 Brixton riot and a public inquiry by Lord Scarman.

A primary school in Southall was later named after Peach. The Blair Peach Award was set up by the National Union of Teachers in 2010 to commemorate the former union member and as recognition of exemplary work by current members in schools and Union branches for equality and diversity issues. In 1989 the poet and activist Chris Searle edited &quot;One for Blair&quot;, an anthology of poems for the young.

The injury to Clarence Baker was commemorated in the Ruts&#x27;s song &quot;Jah War&quot;. The Two-Tone album &quot;The 2 Tone Story&quot; is dedicated to Peach&#x27;s memory. Several songs have been written in Peach&#x27;s memory, or referring to his death, including the Pop Group&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Justice&quot;; the 1982 song &quot;Water of Dreams&quot; by Ralph McTell; and &quot;Reggae Fi Peach&quot; by Linton Kwesi Johnson, which contains the lyrics:

&lt;poem&gt;Blair Peach was not an English man,
Him come from New Zealand,
Now they kill him and him dead and gone,
But his memory lingers on.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Chrysler M Platform (or &quot;M-Body&quot;) was an intermediate-sized automobile platform used by Chrysler motors from 1977 to 1989. It was a successor to the F-body, as used on the Dodge Aspen/ Plymouth Volare. The M-body was also the successor to the short-lived R-body, as the Chrysler New Yorker and Plymouth Gran Fury moved to it following the R-body&#x27;s demise in 1981. The M platform was the final production passenger car with a solid rear axle mounted on Hotchkiss-style, parallel semi-elliptical leaf springs sold in the U.S.

The M-cars were built at St. Louis, Missouri, and Newark, Delaware, with initial debut (LeBaron/Diplomat series) in spring 1977 as 1977 1/2 models, with production shifting to Windsor, Ontario, through 1983, then moving to Fenton, Missouri. Beginning in February 1987 and ending with 1989 model year, the American Motors Main plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was utilized for assembly.

By 1983–84, it became clear that most private buyers preferred the equally roomy but cheaper and more fuel-efficient K-cars; however, the M&#x27;s long-proven traditional engineering, handling, and V8 engine availability appealed to police and taxi fleets, allowing the car&#x27;s continued existence until the end of the decade.
In mid-1988, the Chrysler M-bodies received a driver side air bag.
After the M-bodies were discontinued in mid-1989, Chrysler Corporation didn&#x27;t build a rear wheel drive car outside of trucks and specialty models until LX based cars.

Vehicles on this platform include:
* 1977–1989 Dodge Diplomat
* 1977–1981 Chrysler LeBaron
* 1978–1981 Chrysler Town &amp; Country station wagon
* 1978–1979 Dodge Coronet (South America)
* 1978–1982 Plymouth Caravelle (Canada)
* 1980–1981 Dodge Dart (Mexico)
* 1981–1982 Dodge Magnum 5.9L (Mexico)
* 1982–1989 Plymouth Gran Fury
* 1982 Chrysler New Yorker
* 1983 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue
* 1983–1989 Plymouth Caravelle Salon (Canada)
* 1984–1989 Chrysler Fifth Avenue
*1979–1980 Monteverdi Sierra Convertible 
Three body styles offered:
* 2-door coupe – 1977–1981
* 4-door sedan – 1977–1989
* 4-door station wagon – 1978–1981

Two wheelbases used:

<text>Soyuz TMA-5 was a Soyuz mission to the International Space Station (ISS) launched by a Soyuz-FG launch vehicle.

==Crew==
TMA 5 ISS 10 Crew patches were designed by Seán O&#x27;Mara for USSR Airspace.

==Docking with ISS==
*Docked to ISS: October 16, 2004, 04:16 UTC (to Pirs module)
*Undocked from ISS: November 29, 2004, 09:29 UTC (from Pirs module)
*Docked to ISS: November 29, 2004, 09:53 UTC (to nadir port of Zarya)
*Undocked from ISS: April 24, 2005, 18:44 UTC (from nadir port of Zarya)

==Mission highlights==

25th crewed flight to ISS.

Soyuz TMA-5 is a Soyuz spacecraft that was launched on October 14, 2004 by a Soyuz-FG rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome.

The Expedition 10 crew, Leroy Chiao of the US and Salizhan Sharipov of Russia replaced the Expedition 9 crew, Gennady Padalka - Cdr. Russia and Edward Fincke U.S.A.

The launch of Expedition 10 was delayed beyond its scheduled October 9, 2004 launch date. During preflight testing, an explosive bolt was accidentally activated on the Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft. The resulting damage was repaired prior to launch.

The docking maneuver had to be done manually, as the approach by the automatic system was too fast.

The undocking was done manually as well, as a cautionary measure to save power on a faulty battery.

After 193 days in the station the Expedition 10 crew returned to a soft landing in Kazakhstan together with Italian Roberto Vittori who had flown up with the Expedition 11 crew on Soyuz TMA-6.

<doc id="873277" wikidata="Q3530755" url="?curid=873277" title="Tom Iredale">
<text>Tom Iredale (24 March 1880 – 12 April 1972) was an English-born ornithologist and malacologist who had a long association with Australia, where he lived for most of his life. He was an autodidact who never went to university and lacked formal training. This was reflected in his later work; he never revised his manuscripts and never used a typewriter.

==Early life==
Iredale was born at Stainburn, Workington in Cumberland, England. He was apprenticed to a pharmacist from 1899 to 1901, and used to go bird watching and egg collecting in the Lake District with fellow chemist William Carruthers Lawrie.

==New Zealand==
Iredale emigrated to New Zealand following medical advice, as he had health issues. He may possibly have had tuberculosis. According to a letter to Will Lawrie dated 25 January 1902, he arrived in Wellington, New Zealand in December 1901, and travelled at once on to Lyttelton and Christchurch. On his second day in Christchurch, he discovered that in the Foreign Natural History Gallery of the Museum and Public Library, 2 of 16 English birds&#x27; eggs were wrongly identified – Red Grouse egg labelled as Sandpiper, and Moorhen labelled Water Rail.

Iredale became a clerk in a New Zealand company at Christchurch (1902–1907). On 16 April 1906 he married Alice Maud Atkinson in New Zealand, and they had one child, Ida.

==Kermadec Islands==
In 1908 Iredale joined an expedition to the Kermadec Islands and lived for ten months on these remote islands northeast of New Zealand. Living among and studying thousands of birds, he became a bird expert. He survived by shooting and eating the objects of his study. He also collected molluscs on the island and developed an interest in malacology. As a keen naturalist in those times, he already had a broad interest in nature, but this marked a new turn in his career.

==Queensland==
In 1909 he visited Queensland, Australia, collecting about 300 species of chitons and other molluscs. His reputation among his peers was growing, despite the fact that he had no university degree.

==Britain==
Iredale returned to Britain and became a freelance worker at the British Museum of Natural History in London (1909–1910). There he worked as the assistant of Gregory Mathews on the book &quot;Birds of Australia&quot; (1911–1923). He wrote much of the text, but the work was credited to Mathews.

Whilst working in London he lived with Jane Davies, a concert singer, whom he met at a Rothschild&#x27;s soiree in 1910. The relationship was affected by his explorations abroad although a son and four daughters were born between 1910 and 1917. The son died in infancy.

Iredale continued his work in natural history under the patronage of wealthy naturalists such as Charles Rothschild, for whom he travelled to Hungary to collect fleas from birds. He married Lilian Marguerite Medland (1880–1955) on 8 June 1923. She illustrated several of his books and became one of Australia&#x27;s finest bird artists.

==New South Wales==

Iredale returned to Australia in 1923 and was elected a member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in the same year. He was a RAOU Councillor for New South Wales in 1926, and served on the RAOU Migration Committee 1925–1932.

He took up a position as a conchologist at the Australian Museum in Sydney (1924–1944). Iredale was originally appointed to assist Joyce Allan, the temporary head of the Conchology department. However their positions were reversed in 1925. He worked tirelessly on publications on shells, birds, ecology and zoogeography. He lectured frequently and wrote many popular scientific articles in newspapers. Due to his efforts (and those of later curators), the Mollusc Section at the Australian Museum now maintains the largest research collection of molluscs in the Southern Hemisphere with over 6,000 specimens. He was an Honorary Associate from his retirement in 1944 until his death.

==Taxa==
Iredale recorded a list of around on thousand systematic names he had published by 1932, chronologically arranged and indexed to the relevant work, this unpublished list became the basis for the one produced for the Australian Museum and published in &quot;The Australian zoologist&quot; (1956). detailing the works of Iredale&#x27;s fifty-year career. This list, produced as tribute to the still active author, brought the total number of names to over two and a half thousand, and noted his other publications and collaborators.

Many species and several genera in conchology, ichthyology and ornithology were also named in honour of Iredale, including:
* The molluscan genus &quot;Iredalea&quot; W. Oliver, 1915
* &quot;Cryptoplax iredalei&quot; E. Ashby, 1923

Iredale was made a Fellow of the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales in 1931; was awarded the Clarke Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1959; and was President of the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales in 1937–38.

<text>Ian Chesterton is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and a companion of the First Doctor. He was played in the series by William Russell and was one of the members of the programme&#x27;s first regular cast, appearing in much of the first two seasons from 1963 to 1965. In a film adaptation of one of the serials, &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965), he was played by Roy Castle, but with a very different personality and backstory. Ian appeared in 16 stories and 77 episodes. He later returned for a cameo appearance, played once again by Russell, in the 2022 episode &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;.

==Appearances==

=== Background ===
Ian Chesterton is a science teacher at the Coal Hill School and works with Barbara Wright, a history teacher. One of their students, Susan Foreman, the granddaughter of the Doctor, shows unusually advanced knowledge of science and history. Attempting to solve the mystery of this &quot;unearthly child,&quot; Ian and Barbara follow Susan back home to a junkyard, where they hear her voice coming from what appears to be a police box. When they investigate further, they discover that the police box exterior hides the much larger interior of a time machine known as the TARDIS, and are whisked away on an adventure in time and space with the Doctor and Susan.

=== Character ===
Ian provides the series with an action-orientated figure, able to perform the physical tasks that the elderly Doctor cannot. The Doctor rarely calls him by his first name (Ian) as the others do but rather by his surname, Chesterton. There was also a small number of instances where William Hartnell calls him Chesterfield. His concern, above all, is for the safety of the TARDIS crew, and in the early stories he often takes issue with the Doctor&#x27;s habit of placing the group in harm&#x27;s way just to satisfy his own curiosity. The chemistry between Barbara and himself is also evident, although the nature of their relationship is never made explicit in the television series. Their eventual marriage is revealed in the fourth series of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;.

Ian shows a breadth of skills throughout his tenure with the Doctor. He manages to create fire (&quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;), rides a horse, knows how to fight with swords (&quot;The Romans&quot;) and is knowledgeable about pressure points that can paralyze an opponent (&quot;The Aztecs&quot;). He is also fiercely protective of Barbara, going on a lone mission to rescue her from Saracens in &quot;The Crusade&quot;. In that story, he is also knighted by King Richard I of England as &quot;Sir Ian of Jaffa&quot;. After many travels, Ian and Barbara eventually use a Dalek time machine to go home, two years after their disappearance (&quot;The Chase&quot;).

The character of Ian was intended by the production team to return for a guest appearance in the 1983 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;, but this plan fell through when Russell proved to be unavailable. The script was modified to feature, instead, Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart as the story&#x27;s schoolteacher character. However, in 1999 Russell did return to the part for the BBC Worldwide video release of &quot;The Crusade,&quot; two of the four episodes of which are missing from the archives. Russell provided linking narration between the existing episodes in character as an aged Ian Chesterton reminiscing about the events of the story.

Following his departure, Ian has been name-checked on a number of occasions in the series: He was mentioned by Vicki in episode one of &quot;The Time Meddler&quot;; by the first Doctor in episode four of &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot; and again by his third incarnation on Spiridon in episode one of &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;. Ian was also mentioned in episode one of the 1993 &quot;Children In Need&quot; charity special &quot;Dimensions In Time&quot; and again in &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, a two-part story in the fourth series of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. After meeting Jo Grant and the Eleventh Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith reveals that she has researched the lives of some of the Doctor&#x27;s earth-bound companions and discovered that Ian and Barbara have married each other, become professors, live in Cambridge and are rumoured to have not aged since the 1960s. In the 50th Anniversary Special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the sign for Coal Hill Secondary School identifies the Chairman of the Governors as &quot;I. Chesterton.&quot; In the spin-off series &quot;Class&quot;, it was revealed in the episode &quot;Brave-ish Heart&quot; that the Board of Governors had been removed when the school was refurbished as an Academy.

Russell reprised his role as Ian in the 2022 special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; alongside several other former companions who have gathered together as a support group to talk of their experiences with the Doctor. Ian expresses surprise that the Doctor has become a woman. With this appearance, Russell achieved the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the longest gap between TV appearances.

===Other media===
The novelisation of &quot;The Daleks&quot; by David Whitaker is written in first person from Ian Chesterton&#x27;s perspective, and changes his initial meeting with the Doctor, Susan, and Barbara to a car accident involving the two ladies. The TARDIS then arrives on Skaro rather than prehistoric Earth, with the story continuing much as the TV serial from then on. In this version, Ian is a chemist returning from an unsuccessful job interview, but his character is otherwise unchanged.

Since 1994, the character has also appeared in various novels from Virgin Publishing and BBC Books, set between televised adventures during his particular era of the programme. One BBC Books novel, &quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot; by David A. McIntee (1998), picks up the story of Ian and Barbara, now married to each other, in the early 1970s, the two of them collaborating with the Doctor&#x27;s colleagues at UNIT and his enemy the Master when Ian is hired as the Third Doctor&#x27;s temporary replacement while the Doctor is taking a trip away from Earth. In this book, they have a young son named John. Many of the novels mention a 1980s pop star named Johnny Chester or Johnny Chess, intended to be the same character. Chess is idolised by the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion Ace and has apparently been romantically involved with the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s companion Tegan.

In issue #456 of &quot;The Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, the eleventh Doctor investigates strange psychic metal and finds Ian and Barbara inside, who believe they are teaching several classes for a wide range of students. In the following issues the two help the Doctor investigate a conspiracy that stretches through the years they knew &#x27;their&#x27; Doctor and beyond. At the end of the storyline, Ian and Barbara are married, the Doctor acting as the best man.

Russell has reprised his role as Ian Chesterton in a variety of audio dramas for Big Finish Productions, both Companion Chronicles featuring Ian narrating adventures during his time with the Doctor and more full-cast audios which include Russell acting as Ian and the Doctor. These audios include &quot;The Five Companions&quot;, where Ian is abducted along with other later companions to join the Fifth Doctor in another part of the Death Zone during the events of &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, and &quot;The Time Museum&quot;, where an elderly Ian is captured by a memory-draining entity that tries to drain his memories and use him as bait to lure the Doctor into a trap, only for Ian to turn the tables on his captor and escape. In 2020, Russell reprised the role once again, reuniting with Carole Ann Ford for a special release - &quot;Susan&#x27;s War&quot;. When Susan is recruited for the Time War and given a diplomatic mission to form an alliance with the Sensorites, she requests Ian&#x27;s help as an ambassador given their previous history with the species.

Jamie Glover, having portrayed William Russell in the 2013 docudrama &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, has taken on the role of Ian Chesterton in several Big Finish productions, alongside the rest of the cast taking on the original roles of the actors they were playing. Glover has appeared as Ian in five series of &quot;Doctor Who: The First Doctor Adventures&quot; alongside David Bradley as the Doctor, Claudia Grant as Susan and Jemma Powell as Barbara, as well as an episode of &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot;.

==Film version==
In the film adaptation &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;, Ian Chesterton is the boyfriend of Barbara, granddaughter of Dr. Who.

===Personality===

Played mainly for comic relief, Ian is very different from the resourceful and heroic version of the television series, being clumsy and somewhat foolish. Both versions share a great reluctance to travel - the moment they arrived on Skaro, Ian wants to go home. Susan has a low opinion of him.

===Other media===

====Comics====

The character also appears in the Dell comic strip adaptation of the film and the short story &quot;The House on Oldark Moor&quot; by Justin Richards.

In &quot;Dr Who and the House on Oldark Moor&quot; he subsequently meets an ancient Roman legion in 64 AD and ends up as a gladiator, and travels to Oldark Moor and meets Count Tarkin.

<doc id="873297" wikidata="Q2493244" url="?curid=873297" title="Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)">
<text>Barbara Wright is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and a companion of the First Doctor. She was one of the programme&#x27;s first regulars and appeared in the bulk of its first two seasons from 1963 to 1965, played by Jacqueline Hill. Prior to Hill being cast the part had originally been offered to actress Penelope Lee, who turned the role down. Barbara appeared in 16 stories (74 episodes). In the film version of one of the serials, &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965), Barbara was played by actress Jennie Linden, but with a very different personality and backstory, which includes her being a granddaughter of &quot;Dr Who&quot;.

==Appearances==

===Television===
Barbara Wright first appears in the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; (1963), where she is teaching history at Coal Hill School in London in 1963, working with science teacher Ian Chesterton (William Russell). They are curious about their student Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), who shows an unusually advanced knowledge of science and history, but a rudimentary knowledge of other subjects. In an attempt to learn more about Susan, Barbara and Ian follow her home to a junkyard, where they hear her voice coming from what appears to be a police box. During a confrontation with her grandfather, the Doctor (William Hartnell), Barbara rushes in to the police box, only to discover that its exterior hides the much larger interior of the TARDIS. After the Doctor reveals to Barbara and Ian that he and Susan are aliens exiled from their own planet, he tells them he cannot risk their revealing information about the TARDIS to their contemporary world, and dematerialises the craft against Susan&#x27;s protests. At this point in the series the Doctor had no control over where or when it would land, making a return to London in 1963 impossible to co-ordinate. They are transported back in time to 100,000 BCE Earth, where they are captured by a prehistoric tribe seeking the secret of fire. Once they escape back to the TARDIS, their second trip takes them to the planet Skaro, where they encounter the Daleks for the first time. At the end of the first episode of that serial, Barbara becomes separated from her fellow travellers and is threatened by an unseen creature with a metal arm, marking the first appearance of a Dalek.

In the subsequent story, &quot;The Edge of Destruction&quot;, tensions between the TARDIS crew reach the point of overt conflict when he accuses them of trying to sabotage the TARDIS in an attempt to return to 1963. Barbara remains level-headed and logical, allowing the Doctor to trace the source of the distress to telepathic influences from the TARDIS (which is trying to warn them of a major failure). Seeing that Barbara has been hurt by his accusations, the Doctor apologises and begins to realise he can rely on the two teachers, sealing a friendship which lasts until their eventual departure from the TARDIS. Although mutually respectful and increasingly affectionate, the relationship between the Doctor and Barbara is often tested by their opposing viewpoints. In &quot;The Aztecs&quot;, Barbara is mistaken for the reincarnation of a high priest, Yetaxa, after they find her in possession of his bracelet. Barbara seizes this opportunity to change the course of history, and tries to persuade the Aztecs to abandon human sacrifice, so that by the time Hernán Cortés – who overthrew the Aztec empire – lands he will find a glorious civilisation. The Doctor warns Barbara that she cannot rewrite history, but his protests fall on deaf ears. Barbara fails and, although she has influenced some Aztecs, history remains on course.

Angry at Ian, the Doctor tries to take him and Barbara home, but in &quot;The Reign of Terror&quot; they end up in the French Revolution, where Barbara and Susan are captured and nearly guillotined. In the second season opener, &quot;Planet of Giants&quot; (1964), the TARDIS crew are miniaturised and Barbara becomes infected by a deadly insecticide. Barbara sees the departure of Susan and aids in the rescue of the abandoned orphan Vicki (Maureen O&#x27;Brien), who takes Susan&#x27;s place on the TARDIS. In the subsequent adventure, &quot;The Romans&quot;, Barbara is sold off as a slave and ends up as a servant in Nero&#x27;s palace; due to his interest in her, Nero&#x27;s wife Poppaea tries to poison her. Barbara and Ian leave in &quot;The Chase&quot; (1965). After the Daleks who have been pursuing the TARDIS have been destroyed, Barbara suggests to Ian they use the abandoned Dalek time machine to get home. The Doctor is furious and tries to persuade them to stay with him by suggesting the journey might kill them, but the two teachers had made up their minds. After an emotional farewell to the Doctor and Vicki, Barbara and Ian are returned to London, albeit two years after their disappearance. Back on the TARDIS, the Doctor uses the time-space visualiser to check they have returned safely, and tells Vicki how much he will miss them.

Following her departure in &quot;The Chase&quot;, Barbara has been name-checked in the series on four subsequent occasions. She was mentioned by Vicki in episode one of &quot;The Time Meddler&quot;; by the first Doctor in episode four of &quot;The Massacre&quot;, by his third incarnation on Spiradon in episode one of &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; and again by the seventh Doctor, who intoned her name amongst a list of former companions to ward off the haemovore attack in &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot;. Barbara was also mentioned in episode one of the 1993 Children In Need charity special &quot;Dimensions In Time&quot; and again in &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, a two part story in the fourth series of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; transmitted in October 2010. After meeting Jo Grant and the Eleventh Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith reveals that she has researched the lives of some of the Doctor&#x27;s Earth-bound companions and discovered that Ian and Barbara have married each other, become professors, live in Cambridge and are rumoured to have not aged since the 1960s.

This non-aging rumour however, has been seemingly contradicted by an elderly Ian Chesterton’s appearance in the 2022 episode story, &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;

In the 2016 spin off &quot;Class&quot;, the refurbished Coal Hill Academy contains a building called &quot;The Barbara Wright Building&quot;.

===Other media===
Since 1994, the character has appeared in several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels from Virgin Publishing and BBC Books. In the BBC Books novel, &quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot; by David A. McIntee (1998), the story of Ian and Barbara, now married to each other, is picked up in the early 1970s. In this book, they have a young son named John. Barbara also appears in several Big Finish Productions audio dramas, which are narrated by surviving cast members Carole Ann Ford or William Russell. Actress Jemma Powell, who played Jacqueline Hill and Barbara in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time, also voiced the character in Big Finish audio dramas.

In the novelisation of &quot;The Daleks&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks&quot; by David Whitaker, Barbara and Susan have just been in a car accident when they first meet Ian. After entering the TARDIS, the remainder of the story largely follows the events of &quot;The Daleks&quot;.

In issue #456 of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor investigates strange psychic metal and finds Ian and Barbara inside, who believe they are teaching several classes for a wide range of students. In the following issues the two help the Doctor investigate a conspiracy that stretches through the years they knew &#x27;their&#x27; Doctor and beyond. At the end, Ian and Barbara are married.

==Film version==
In the film &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965), Barbara (portrayed by Jennie Linden) is one of Dr. Who&#x27;s granddaughters and the girlfriend of Ian Chesterton.
Barbara does not appear in &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966) being replaced by Louise, Dr. Who&#x27;s niece, with no mention as to her fate.

====Comics====

The character also appears in the Dell comic strip adaptation of the film and the short story &quot;The House on Oldark Moor&quot; by Justin Richards.

In &quot;Dr. Who and the House on Oldark Moor&quot;, Barbara met an ancient Roman legion in 64 A.D., and travelled to Oldark Moor and met Count Tarkin. Barbara was absent during two of Dr. Who and Susan&#x27;s subsequent adventures, as was Ian, with Susan believing that she eventually stopped seeing, though she had not actually gotten over him.

In &quot;Doctor Who 3 - The Third Motion Picture&quot;, partway through the Scriptwriter&#x27;s typing the script of the third Dr. Who film which would have featured Barbara rekindling her relationship with an increasingly, literally clownish Ian, Susan realised that she and all her family were fictional constructs; she reached out into the real world and killed the Scriptwriter by staking him through the heart.

==Reception==
In a review of &quot;Meglos&quot; (1980), in which Hill was cast as the villain, &quot;Radio Times&quot; Mark Braxton wrote that Barbara &quot;will always be one of &quot;the&quot; great companions&quot;, speculating that her &quot;magnificently haughty turn&quot; as Yetaxa in &quot;The Aztecs&quot; was why she was cast in &quot;Meglos&quot;. Gavin Fuller of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named Barbara the sixth best female &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion. Will Salmon of &quot;SFX&quot; listed the departure of Ian and Barbara as the eighth best companion departure. In 2010, readers of &quot;Radio Times&quot; voted Barbara as the 26th greatest companion, out of 48 options.

<doc id="873298" wikidata="Q362072" url="?curid=873298" title="Smell-O-Vision">
<text>Smell-O-Vision is a system that released odor during the projection of a film so that the viewer could &quot;smell&quot; what was happening in the movie. Created by Hans Laube, the technique made its only appearance in the 1960 film &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot;, produced by Mike Todd Jr., son of film producer Mike Todd. The process injected 30 odors into a movie theater&#x27;s seats when triggered by the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

Roughly similar concepts integrating odor experiences into entertainment performances date back at least to 1868 for live theatre, with the first film usage in 1906. Other approaches include General Electric&#x27;s &quot;Smell-O-Rama&quot; in 1953 and the rival &quot;AromaRama&quot; system in 1959. In cheeky homage to this era, John Waters enhanced his 1981 film &quot;Polyester&quot; with an &quot;Odorama&quot; scratch-n-sniff card.

== History ==
In 1868, a novel effect was used at the Alhambra Theatre of Variety in London when Rimmel scent was sprayed into the theatre during the Magic Dance of &quot;The Fairy Acorn Tree&quot;. The use of scents in conjunction with film dates back to 1906, before the introduction of sound. In this first instance, a 1958 issue of &quot;Film Daily&quot; claims that Samuel Roxy Rothafel of the Family Theatre in Forest City, Pennsylvania, placed a wad of cotton wool that had been soaked in rose oil in front of an electric fan during a newsreel about the Rose Bowl Game. However, between 1903 and 1915, there were no games held, so it is unknown what the newsreel was about, although the Rose Parade (which has been held annually since 1890) seems likely. In 1916, the Rivoli Theatre in New York was equipped with the ability to pump scents into the theatre for the short film &quot;Story of the Flowers&quot;.

During the screening of the film &quot;Lilac Time&quot; in 1929 at the Fenway Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts, the manager poured a pint of lilac perfume into the plenum chamber of the theatre&#x27;s ventilation system so that the audience would smell lilac when the film&#x27;s title appeared. The same year, during the showing of &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;, a New York City theater sprayed perfume from the ceiling. Arthur Mayer installed an in-theater smell system in Paramount&#x27;s Rialto Theater on Broadway in 1933, which he used to deliver odors during a film. However, it would take over an hour to clear the scents from the theater, and some smells would linger for days afterward. 

All of these early attempts, however, were made by theater owners and not part of the films themselves. The audience could be distracted by the scents instead of focusing on what the film director intended. Furthermore, because of the size of the theaters, large amounts of perfume had to be released to reach all members of the audience. This caused another problem: the human nose has a difficult time transitioning between smells until the molecules that triggered one smell are completely cleared from the nose, and with that volume of perfume, the scents would mix, becoming muddled.

Walt Disney was the first filmmaker to explore the idea of actually including scents with his 1940 film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, but eventually decided against pursuing this for cost reasons.

Laube&#x27;s technique, which he initially dubbed &quot;Scentovision&quot;, was introduced during the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The system connected pipes to individual seats in theaters, so that the timing and amount could be carefully controlled by the projectionist using a control board. The first feature length film using the process was the 35-minute &quot;Mein Traum&quot; which was screened during the fair on October 10, 1940. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1943 that Scentovision &quot;is said to have produced odors as quickly and easily as the soundtrack of a film produces sound&quot;, but Laube, a Swiss national, returned to Europe in 1946, unable to interest any film or television studios in his invention.

Further attempts with releasing scents timed to key points in a film happened at the Vogue Theatre in Detroit, Michigan in 1940 with &quot;Boom Town&quot; and &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot;.

General Electric developed a system in 1953 that they called &quot;Smell-O-Rama&quot;. They demonstrated its potential by exhibiting a three-dimensional image of a rose accompanied by floral scents.

In 1955, Laube, with financing from the Stanley Warner Corporation, set up a working model of his system at the Cinerama-Warner Theatre in New York to show a ten-minute pilot film. In November 1957, the system, owned by Laube and Bert S. Good, was patented in the United States.

== Competition with AromaRama ==
In September 1958, an announcement was made about a film called &quot;Screen Scent No. 1&quot; to be filmed in March 1959 using a fragrance process called &quot;Weiss-Rhodia Screen-Scent&quot; to be produced by a company headed by Charles H. Weiss, a public relations executive. The film was described as a &quot;kaleidoscope of comedy, drama and travelogue&quot;. The process had been developed over two years by Rhodia, Inc., a subsidiary of Rhône-Poulenc.

In October 1959, it was reported that Walter Reade Jr. was rushing to release &quot;The China Wall&quot;, an Italian-made travelogue through China at the Palace Theatre in New York City. The system to be used for the film was different to that of Smell-O-Vision as it sent scents through the air-conditioning system of a theater. 

The particular technique was invented by Charles Weiss, who stated in a 1959 appearance on CBS&#x27;s television programme &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;:I ... have invented a process to make movies smell. I call the process AromaRama. After more than two and a half years of work, our picture &quot;Behind the Great Wall&quot; will open December 2 at the Mayfair Theater in New York. In addition to seeing the action and hearing the dialogue, our audiences will be able to smell the scenes. More than 100 different aromas will be injected into the theater during the film. Among these are the odors of grass, earth, exploding firecrackers, a river, incense, burning torches, horses, restaurants, the scent of a trapped tiger and many more. We believe, with Rudyard Kipling, that smells are surer than sounds or sights to make the heartstrings crack.

The film was eventually released as &quot;Behind the Great Wall&quot; on December 9, 1959 at the (recently renamed) DeMille Theatre in New York, just a month ahead of &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot;, and the competition between the two films was called &quot;the battle of the smellies&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot;. The film was directed by Carlo Lizzani with the &quot;AromaRama&quot; process conceived and directed by Charles Weiss. The film was accompanied by a range of 72 smells that included incense, smoke, burning pitch, oranges, spices and a barnyard of geese.

Besides the slightly earlier release date, the name AromaRama itself made fun of Todd Sr.&#x27;s Cinerama process, and the choice of film was also deliberate, as travelogues were one of Cinerama&#x27;s specialties.

An alternate explanation of the provenance of the word &quot;AromaRama&quot; was provided by Weiss: &quot;Screenwriter Henry Myers (Destry Rides Again) came up with the name &quot;AromaRama&quot; because the process was to the sense of smell what Cinerama was to the sense of sight. AromaRama echoed Cinerama rather than made fun of it. &quot;Behind the Great Wall&quot; was chosen because distributor Walter Reade felt many of the scenes would be even more impressive with scents added. Because it had won major awards in Europe, it was expected to be well received in America – and it was.

The film received scathing treatment from &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Bosley Crowther, who called it a &quot;stunt&quot; that had an &quot;artistic benefit&quot; of &quot;nil&quot;. The accuracy of the odors was described as &quot;capricious ... elusive, oppressive or perfunctory and banal ... merely synthetic smells that occasionally befit what one is viewing, but more often they confuse the atmosphere&quot;. By contrast, the film itself, which was not made with AromaRama in mind, received high praise. Further negative reviews came from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Not all reviews were unfavorable. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, in its review titled &quot;AromaRama Premieres Here: Audience Smells What It Sees and Hears in Movie&quot;, the uncited critic writes: &quot;With a few minor exceptions, the audience last night pronounced the succession of smells a total success from the start, which consisted of an opening from Chet Huntley, television commentator, who demonstrated what was about to happen by slicing an orange while the odor track suffused the theatre with a smell of oranges being sliced.&quot; A follow-up article in the December 13, 1959 &quot;Sunday Herald Tribune&quot; said: &quot;Curiously enough, they do not give the impression of being blown in or wafted from any specific direction (although they are said to be linked to the airconditioning system.) Actually the individual smells simply appear in the nostrils without any effort being made to sniff or strain for them. And what is more remarkable, each individual odor disappears promptly when the image smelled leaves the screen ... There is no question about its effectiveness in creating illusions of reality.&quot;

&quot;The Sunday News&quot; awarded the film stars out of a possible 4 stars in its review titled Behind Great Wall&#x27; Puts Smell on Screen&quot;. Reviewer Dorothy Masters wrote, &quot;Several wise men anticipated the birth of AromaRama, the major prophet being Charles Weiss, a public relations executive, who journeyed afar to enlist the support of a chemical company, an electronic air-filter plant, a camera equipment firm and an industrial timer organization. Together they devised a workable system for coordinating the picture of an orange with the smell of an orange.&quot;

The December 21, 1959 edition of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; stated in its review of &quot;Behind the Great Wall&quot;, &quot;The AromaRama process itself, developed by a public relations executive, Charles Weiss, is fairly ingenious. The film carries a &#x27;scent track&#x27; that transmits cues to an electronic &#x27;trigger&#x27; that fires a salvo of scent into the theatre through the air-conditioning ports. The AromaRama people claim that they can reach every nose in the house within two seconds and remove the odor almost as fast. The perfumes are built up on a quick-evaporating base (Freon) and as the air is drawn off for filtering it is passed over electrically charged baffles that precipitate the aromatic particles.&quot;

The film&#x27;s poor reception threatened to derail the debut &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot; before it even opened, as the cinematic press now expected the odor release system to be poor.

In its first week in New York it grossed $33,400 from 29 performances.

Charles Weiss continued to experiment with motion pictures and aromas, adding fragrances to classic black and white films to demonstrate how smells might be used in the future.

== &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot; ==
Todd Sr. had staged a series of musical films at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair and met Laube during this time. Fifteen years later, Todd and his son were thinking of ways they could enhance their film &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. They remembered Laube&#x27;s invention and although they decided not to use it for this film, Todd Jr., after his father&#x27;s death, was intrigued enough to sign Laube to a movie deal.

Laube&#x27;s system, which was renamed &quot;Smell-O-Vision&quot; by Todd, had been improved in the intervening time. Now, instead of the scents being manually released, it used what he called a &quot;smell brain&quot;, which was a series of perfume containers linked in a belt, arranged in the order that they would be released. The belt was then wound around a motorized reel. As the film threaded through the movie projector, markers on it would cue the brain. Needles would pierce membranes on the containers, releasing the scents, which would then be blown by fans through the pipes to individual vents underneath the audience members&#x27; seats. The cost of outfitting a theater to accommodate the system was anywhere from US$15,000 at Chicago&#x27;s Cinestage theater to $1,000,000 elsewhere ($ to $ today).

Both Laube and Todd understood that the system had aesthetic limitations. For example, a heavy drama was not the sort of film that could employ it well. Thus, the system was to be deployed with the mystery-comedy &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot;, which would be the first film in which smells revealed certain plot points to the audience. For example, one character is identified by the smell of pipe tobacco.

=== Reception ===
Smell-O-Vision did not work as intended. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, aromas were released with a distracting hissing noise and audience members in the balcony complained that the scents reached them several seconds after the action was shown on the screen. In other parts of the theater, the odors were too faint, causing audience members to sniff loudly in an attempt to catch the scent. These technical problems were mostly corrected after the first few showings, but the poor word of mouth, in conjunction with generally negative reviews of the film itself, signaled the end of Smell-O-Vision. A 2000 &quot;Time&quot; reader survey listed Smell-O-Vision in the &quot;Top 100 Worst Ideas of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Scent of Mystery&quot; was shown with an animated short titled &quot;Old Whiff&quot;, which was about a bloodhound who had lost his sense of smell; the dog&#x27;s voice was provided by Bert Lahr.

== Legacy ==

In homage to Smell-O-Vision, American film director John Waters released an enhanced &quot;Odorama&quot; version of his film &quot;Polyester&quot; in 1981. Waters included scratch and sniff cards that the audience could use while watching the movie. Each card contained ten numbered spots that were scratched when that number flashed in the bottom right corner of the screen. Although this approach solved the problems inherent in previous attempts at this technology, it did not gain widespread usage for other films. The idea, however, was duplicated four times: firstly in the UK by ITV in June 1985 when an edition of science programme &quot;The Real World&quot; and Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;No. 73&quot; were both aired in &quot;Aromavision&quot; with accompanying &quot;Aromapack&quot; scratch and sniff cards distributed with listings magazine TVTimes; the second time in the mid-1980s when MTV aired &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot; in conjunction with a convenience store promotion that offered scratch and sniff cards; the third time was the 2003 animated film &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, the makers of which claimed it was a homage to Waters. The fourth time was with the fourth installment of the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; movie series, in which scratch n&#x27; sniff cards were given to movie goers, who were instructed to scratch the number as it came up on screen.

Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort currently make use of this idea, in their 3-D films and other attractions. Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot; releases an unpleasant odor coinciding with a stink bug on-screen, causing an audience reaction; similarly &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Philharmagic&quot; at the Magic Kingdom and Disney California Adventure produces pie scents. &quot;Soarin&#x27; Over California&quot;, &quot;Soarin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Soarin&#x27; Around the World&quot; include orange blossoms, pine forest, sea air fragrances, grass, and cherry blossoms as the scenery flies below the passengers. &quot;Monsters, Inc. Mike &amp; Sulley to the Rescue!&quot; briefly takes riders through a ginger scented sushi house. It is unknown, however, if the technology behind this is the same or a derivative of Laube&#x27;s work.

In 2006, NTT Communications, a Japanese telecom giant, developed a new way to display odors during the release of Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The New World&quot;. During seven key moments throughout the film, scents were emitted by an internet server that was linked to the reel of film, effectively downloading the scent. The scents used were supposed to evoke from the audience the emotions that were trying to be expressed in the film. Scents included floral for romance scenes, peppermint, and rosemary for tear-jerking moments; orange and grapefruit for joyful sequences; and eucalyptus, tea tree, and herbs for angry scenes.

In 2010, the Norwegian film &quot;Kurt Josef Wagle And The Legend of the Fjord Witch&quot; by director Tommy Wirkola was released to cinemas with scratch and sniff cards that the audience could use while watching the movie. One year later, the American film &quot;Spy Kids: All the Time in the World&quot; by director Robert Rodriguez used the same idea, advertised as &quot;4D Aroma-Scope&quot;.

There have been further attempts to develop similar systems for the use with television or advertising screens using gel pellets or inkjet printers to spray small amounts of scent.

Regal Cinemas launched a new theater type, called 4DX, which incorporates smells into the movie experience. Other off-screen features are incorporated into 4DX as well, including motion enabled chairs, fog, strong scents, and water and air to simulate wind and rain. Regal currently operates 18 theaters with 4DX.

Scents were included along with haptic sensations in the 2023 4D film &quot;Postcard from Earth&quot;.

=== April Fools&#x27; joke ===

In 1965, BBC TV played an April Fools&#x27; Day joke on their viewers. The network aired an &quot;interview&quot; with a man who had invented a new technology called &quot;Smellovision&quot; that allowed viewers at home to experience aromas produced in the television studio. To demonstrate, the man chopped some onions and brewed a pot of coffee. Viewers called in to confirm that they had smelled the aromas that were &quot;transmitted&quot; through their television sets.

=== In television ===
The 1944 Merrie Melodies cartoon &quot;The Old Grey Hare&quot; includes a newspaper article which reads &quot;Smellovision replaces television&quot; seen by Elmer Fudd after he apparently visits in the distant future of the year 2000. However, another part of the article which was not read out loud by Elmer hints criticism from then-&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; music composer and former Walt Disney colleague Carl Stalling, stating that &quot;Carl Stalling Sez It Will Never Work!&quot; 

Steve Urkel invents a helmet-based smellovision device on an episode of the sitcom, &quot;Family Matters&quot; and convinces Carl Winslow to try it out. As usual, however, the device quickly goes haywire, burning Carl&#x27;s hair in the process.

On the animated sitcom &quot;Futurama&quot; in the episodes &quot;The Honking&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Lobstertainment!&quot;, Smell-O-Vision has successfully taken off. In the latter episode, Harold Zoid, a washed up movie actor, comments he flopped after they invented &quot;Smell-O-Vision&quot;. In the former episode, there is also a reference to the system when the logo is shown at the start of the episode. It reads at the bottom &quot;Now in Smell-O-Vision&quot; and another has the sentence &quot;Smell-O-Vision users insert nostril tubes now&quot;. In addition, the episode &quot;A Big Piece of Garbage&quot; introduces the Smelloscope, a telescope-like device that allows people to smell distant cosmic objects.

In 1995, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot; brought scratch and sniff smell-o-vision to the masses. Through the Saturday evening family show &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, viewers could experience various odors to complement their television experience. A similar event called &quot;Smelly Telly&quot; for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; animated series involved scratch and sniff cards as well, lasting from April 26 to 30, 1999.

<doc id="873307" wikidata="Q1780996" url="?curid=873307" title="Compression lift">
<text>In aerodynamics, compression lift refers to the increased pressure under an aircraft that uses shock waves generated by its own supersonic flight to generate lift. This can lead to dramatic improvements in lift for supersonic/hypersonic aircraft. Clarence Syvertson and Alfred J. Eggers discovered this phenomenon in 1956 as they analyzed abnormalities at the reentry of nuclear warheads.

The basic concept of compression lift is well known; &quot;planing&quot; boats reduce drag by &quot;surfing&quot; on their own bow wave in exactly the same fashion. Using this effect in aircraft is more difficult, however, because the &quot;wake&quot; is not generated until supersonic speeds are reached, and is highly angled. Aircraft have to be carefully shaped to take full advantage of this effect. In addition, the angle of the shock waves varies greatly with speed, making it even more difficult to design a craft that gains significant lift over a wide range of speeds.

Higher speed designs using compression lift, waveriders, remain an interesting possibility for hypersonic vehicle designs, although only testbed models have been flown. The Boeing X-51 (Waverider) also uses compression lift.

<text>Susan Foreman (also known as Susan Campbell in spin-off media) is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The granddaughter of the Doctor and original companion of their first incarnation, she was played by actress Carole Ann Ford from 1963 to 1964, in the show&#x27;s first season and the first two stories of the second season. Ford reprised the role for the feature-length 20th anniversary episode &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983) and the 30th anniversary charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; (1993).

==Conception and development==
The earliest scripts for the series had a completely different origin for the character of Susan, that of an alien princess named Suzanne – saved by the First Doctor from a world different from his own. Carole Ann Ford recalled that she was told her character would be &quot;an &quot;Avengers&quot;-type girl – with all the kapow of that – plus she would have telepathic powers. She was going to be able to &quot;fly the TARDIS&quot; as well as [the Doctor] and have the most extraordinary wardrobe&quot;. However, none of this happened, as it was decided that the character would be more of an &quot;ordinary&quot; teenager, giving younger viewers a figure to identify with.

While the original outline for the series did not intend the pair to be related, writer Anthony Coburn created the family tie that Susan was the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter. According to founding producer Verity Lambert, &quot;Coburn felt there was something not quite proper about an old man travelling around the galaxy with a young girl for a companion.&quot; Ford felt that the Doctor and Susan&#x27;s relationship was different from that of later characters who had been branded as &quot;companions&quot; because she was also the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter.

Ford has stated that little background information on Susan&#x27;s character or history was provided to her by the production team, and so to inform her performance, she would often discuss and invent ideas about Susan with her co-star William Hartnell. They established that the Doctor had &quot;done something to annoy his own people&quot; that had caused his and Susan&#x27;s exile. Ford also points out that suggestions that Susan was not the Doctor&#x27;s natural granddaughter were first put forward in the 1990s. However, in 2013, she revealed that the producers had initially insisted that Susan did not refer to the Doctor as her grandfather in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; special. Ford recalled, &quot;They said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t really want people to perceive him as having had sex with someone, to father a child.&#x27; I just screamed with hysterical laughter and said, &#x27;In that case, I&#x27;m not doing it.&#x27;&quot; The script was changed to include references to the characters&#x27; relationship.

Media historian James Chapman has written that the way Susan was written made her limited, because &quot;she was required to fill the role of the &#x27;screamer&#x27; and often had little to do beyond looking pretty and frightened&quot;. Ford was similarly displeased with her character, sometimes finding her &quot;pathetic&quot; and frustrating because she was not allowed to develop. In addition, Ford found the series too repetitive. Susan became the first companion to leave the programme, after just 51 episodes. Ford felt that Susan was allowed to develop more in the Big Finish audio dramas.

==Appearances==
===Television===
Susan is introduced in the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; (1963), with the first episode focusing on her as an unusual teenager with an advanced knowledge of history and science. This catches the attention of her teachers at Coal Hill School, Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), who follow her home to a junkyard owned by an unseen proprietor named I. M. Foreman. It is implied within the story that Susan took the surname &quot;Foreman&quot; from this junkyard sign as an alias for use at the school, for when her chemistry teacher assumed that her grandfather was &quot;Doctor Foreman&quot; the Doctor replied, &quot;Doctor who? What&#x27;s he talking about?&quot;, indicating that he was unfamiliar with the surname. It is revealed that she and her grandfather, the Doctor (William Hartnell), are exiles from their own people in &quot;another time, another world&quot; and have been travelling through space and time in a machine she named the TARDIS from the acronym &quot;Time and Relative Dimension in Space&quot;. As Ian and Barbara have gained this knowledge, the Doctor whisks them away in the TARDIS against their will, but he cannot accurately fly the machine.

Susan continues to travel with the Doctor and her two teachers until the 1964 serial, &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;. During the events of that story, Susan falls in love with David Campbell (Peter Fraser), a young freedom fighter in the 22nd century. However, Susan feels that she has to stay with and take care of her grandfather. The Doctor, realising that Susan is now a grown woman and deserves a future away from him, locks her out of the TARDIS and leaves after a tearful farewell. Ford reprised the role of Susan on television in the 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), but no mention of David, or what became of him, was made on screen. In the novelisation of the same story, they are still married. Ford also reprised her role for the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;.

In &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot;, the Seventh Doctor states that he does not know if he has any family. In &quot;The End of the World&quot;, the Ninth Doctor states that his home world has been destroyed and that he is the last of the Time Lords. Although Susan is not mentioned by name, the Ninth Doctor says in &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; that his &quot;whole family&quot; died, and in &quot;The Empty Child&quot;, Doctor Constantine remarks he has been a father and grandfather, but now he is neither, to which the Doctor replies, &quot;I know the feeling.&quot; In &quot;Fear Her&quot;, the Tenth Doctor states, &quot;I was a dad once,&quot; but does not elaborate on this revelation. In &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, the Doctor tells Donna Noble &quot;I&#x27;ve been a father before... I lost all that a long time ago, along with everything else&quot;, admitting, &quot;I can see them. The hole they left, all the pain that filled it&quot;. In &quot;The Rings of Akhaten&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor recounts the occasion that he travelled with his granddaughter to the rings of the planet Akhaten. The 2013 episode &quot;Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS&quot; contains audio from the scene in &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; where Susan explains how she named the TARDIS. A brief glimpse of Susan, played by an unidentified body double, is seen in the opening scene of &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, which depicts the Doctor and Susan leaving Gallifrey in a TARDIS.

Following the revelation in the 2013 specials, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; and &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, that the Time Lords were not, as originally believed, wiped out by the Doctor&#x27;s hand, Susan&#x27;s fate after &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; remains ambiguous. In &quot;Death in Heaven&quot; (2014), the Twelfth Doctor&#x27;s (Peter Capaldi) companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) pretends to be the Doctor in order to confuse the Cybermen and buy herself time to escape; she describes the Doctor&#x27;s children and grandchildren as &quot;missing and, I assume, dead.&quot; In the &quot;Class&quot; episode &quot;For Tonight We Might Die&quot;, Susan&#x27;s name is displayed on the roll of honour at Coal Hill Academy, along with Clara Oswald and Danny Pink. A photograph of Susan is seen on the Doctor&#x27;s desk in a university where he is lecturing in 2017&#x27;s &quot;The Pilot&quot;, beside a photograph of River Song. 

When the Fifteenth Doctor visits 1963 with his companion Ruby Sunday (&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Chord&quot;), he mentions that his younger self is currently living with Susan in Shoreditch, but he subsequently speculates that Susan is almost certainly probably dead now after the genocide of the rest of the Time Lords.

Later in the season, (&quot;The Legend of Ruby Sunday&quot;), The Doctor believes that a woman who has been reoccurring through his travels (played by Susan Twist), is a regenerated version of his granddaughter Susan. This is dismissed after the villain of the finale, Sutekh, reveals that upon looking inside the TARDIS, he saw &quot;(Susan&#x27;s) name&quot;, and decided to use her as a trap to lure in The Doctor. He reveals that the recurring Susan Triad character, is in fact an apparition of his own design, and he has been planting them everywhere the TARDIS has landed since the TV story &quot;Pyramids of Mars.&quot;

The Doctor remarks in the season finale regarding Susan that &quot;(He will) maybe find her again one day.&quot;

===Other media===
Susan&#x27;s character has been expounded upon in spin-off media. In 1983, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s then-script editor Eric Saward wrote a short story dealing with the Doctor&#x27;s departure from Gallifrey for the &quot;Radio Times Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special&quot;. This story, &quot;Birth of a Renegade&quot;, depicts Susan as a descendant of Time Lord founder Rassilon and the last surviving member of Gallifrey&#x27;s royal family, unrelated to the Doctor. A later script editor, Andrew Cartmel, had another explanation of Susan&#x27;s origins. This account, part of the &quot;Cartmel Masterplan&quot;, was not used in the programme, but was used as background for several of the Virgin New Adventures novels, most notably &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; by Marc Platt. In this version, Susan is the granddaughter of the mysterious Gallifreyan founder known as the Other, who may have been reincarnated as the Doctor. The Doctor had travelled back to the dawn of Time Lord civilisation and rescued Susan, who recognised him as her grandfather.

The character has also appeared in several licensed novels. She makes a cameo appearance in the 1994 New Adventures novel &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot; and stars in the 1995 Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. She appears in three Past Doctor Adventures novels set within her time on the television programme, &quot;The Witch Hunters&quot; (1998), &quot;City at World&#x27;s End&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Time Travellers&quot; (2005). The latter explains why the Doctor left Susan. During the events of that novel, the Doctor becomes involved in the British Army&#x27;s time travel experiments, which risk him being noticed by the Time Lords. He then resolves to begin looking for a place where Susan can be safe and content so that if he is ever apprehended by their people, she will still be free. Susan reappears in the 1998 Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Legacy of the Daleks&quot; by John Peel, which takes place after the events of &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;. At the end of that novel, Susan comes into possession of the Master&#x27;s TARDIS after he tries to capture her, and is once again able to roam time and space. The 2001 Telos novella &quot;Time and Relative&quot; takes place just prior to &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; and involves Susan and several of her classmates from Coal Hill School trying to survive an alien invasion of Earth by a race of ice beings called the Cold and at the same time convince the Doctor to stop the attack. In the 2003 Telos novella &quot;Frayed&quot;, which also takes place prior to the serial &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, Susan&#x27;s name was given to her from a young girl in a besieged human medical facility on another planet, after the girl&#x27;s mother. The &quot;Eighth Doctor Adventures&quot; novel &quot;Sometime Never...&quot; depicts the Doctor&#x27;s adoptive granddaughter Zezanne as an alien princess who would later travel to a junkyard in 1963 with a man who resembled the First Doctor. In the 2017 novel &quot;A Brief History of Time Lords&quot;, an image of Susan is shown as one of the things that the Doctor took with him when leaving Gallifrey, although she is listed as the President&#x27;s daughter.

Susan also appears, played by Ford, in the Companion Chronicles audio drama series from Big Finish. &quot;Quinnis&quot; (2010) takes place before the television series, when the Doctor and Susan were traveling alone. In the Big Finish bonus release &quot;An Earthly Child&quot; (2010), Susan is reunited with the Doctor in his eighth incarnation (Paul McGann), and has a son named Alex (Jake McGann). She appears in the Eighth Doctor Adventures audio plays in &quot;Relative Dimensions&quot; (2010) and &quot;Lucie Miller&quot; / &quot;To the Death&quot; (2011). In the later Short Trip &quot;All Hands on Deck&quot;, Susan decides to leave her life on Earth and join the Time War, with the box set &quot;Susan&#x27;s War&quot; depicting her service in the War. She helps the Time Lords form an alliance with the Sensorites to gain the aid of their telepathic circuits- also recruiting Ian to act as a diplomat in the process- (&quot;Sphere of Influence&quot;) and later missions including capturing a Dalek agent on Florana (&quot;The Uncertain Shore&quot;) and preventing a plan to configure the vortex-dwelling Orovix as a weapon against the Daleks as Susan recognised that they were too dangerous (&quot;Assets of War&quot;). She was briefly manipulated by a Dalek agent to go back to 1963 to try and help them retrieve the Hand of Omega before the Hand could be used to destroy Skaro, but she and the Eighth Doctor are able to trick the Daleks into taking a fake Hand without alerting the Renegade Daleks of that era to the presence of the Time War Daleks (&quot;The Shoreditch Intervention&quot;).

Ford also played an alternate version of Susan in Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; audio plays &quot;Auld Mortality&quot; (2003) and &quot;A Storm of Angels&quot; (2005), in which Susan has become President of Gallifrey. In the 2003 &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; play &quot;Exile&quot;, an alternative Doctor, whose latest regeneration was female (played by Arabella Weir), settles on Earth in 2003 using the identity and 1963 school records of Susan Foreman.

On 9 July 1994, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Whatever Happened to Susan Foreman?&quot;, a humorous investigation into Susan&#x27;s background. Susan was portrayed by Jane Asher. In the 2013 BBC drama &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, which told the story of the first three years of the show, Claudia Grant played Carole Ann Ford. Grant then went on to play Susan herself in a series of First Doctor stories for Big Finish.

In the short story, &#x27;&quot;Press Play&quot;, the Thirteenth Doctor discovered a message in the TARDIS left for her by Susan informing her that before she had &quot;activated the TARDIS record mode&quot; before she left in &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;.

==Film version==

In the films &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966), Susan (portrayed by Roberta Tovey) is one of Dr. Who’s granddaughters, she is depicted as a more brave and resourceful child than her timid, teenage television counterpart.

===Other media===

====Comics====

The character also appears in the Dell comic strip adaptation of the film, the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip stories &quot;Daleks Versus the Martians&quot; and &quot;Dr. Who and the Mechonoids&quot;, and the short story &quot;The House on Oldark Moor&quot; by Justin Richards.

In &quot;Dr Who and the House on Oldark Moor&quot;, she and the others encountered an ancient Roman legion in 64 A.D., and subsequently travelled to Oldark Moor and met Count Tarkin.

In &quot;Doctor Who 3 - The Third Motion Picture&quot;, Susan realized that she and the others were only fictional constructs created by the Scriptwriter, and managed to reach out and pierce the Scriptwriter through the heart with a stake while the Scriptwriter was scripting a third Dr. Who movie, putting an end to the franchise and freeing herself from fictionality.

====Other appearances====

Roberta Tovey reprised the role of Susan for a minisode in the documentary &quot;More than... 30 Years in the TARDIS&quot;.

In the Dalek-infested London of the 22nd century, the Black and Red Dalek and two Robomen walk past a sign reading: ″IT IS FORBIDDEN TO DUMP BODIES IN THE RIVER″, as well as an inconspicuous police box, not recognising it as Tardis. After the Daleks have gone past, the doors open to reveal Susan, grinning at her successful stealth.

In an interview following the skit, Tovey harboured hopes of a follow-up to the two Cushing films centering on an adult version of her Susan, having taken on her grandfather&#x27;s mantle as an adventurer in time and space, these plans never materialised.

<doc id="873313" wikidata="Q686363" url="?curid=873313" title="Radegast, Saxony-Anhalt">
<text>Radegast () is a small town in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is the smallest town in Saxony-Anhalt and is located about 13 km south of the district capital of Köthen. Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the town Südliches Anhalt.

== Geography ==

Radegast is located midway between the cities of Köthen (Anhalt), Wolfen, Bitterfeld and Dessau.

=== Geographical Situation ===
The area of Radegast borders on the national park &quot;Cösitzer Teich&quot; in the southeast and on the conservation park &quot;Fuhneaue&quot; in the south.

=== Geology===
Radegast is situated at the margin of the Köthen culture plain. Here it ascends from the Fuhne valley, so the difference in height is about on a short distance. The town is situated right in the middle of a former swampland. The upper level of this swamp has been quite fertile for a long time. The official Radegast Chronicle says, &quot;the lower level of the soil in this area is not bad, but its value is lowered because it is too damp.&quot; The upper level to a depth of about is meadowland with a lush vegetation of grasses and swampland, which is very fertile and became very calcareous, too because of the stagnant water. This is followed by peat, which was cut for being used as peat coal in former times. The upper level is bordered by an impermeable stratum of clay. At shallow depth large boulders can be found from ice age deposits. The quality of the soil became a lot better because of its agricultural use. It offers perfect conditions for cultivating sugar beets and wheat.

=== Neighbouring towns and villages ===
The neighbouring village in the north of Radegast is called Weißandt-Gölzau, in the east it is the village Zehbitz, in the south there is the town of Zörbig and in the west Radegast is bordering on Cösitz, which is a now part of Zörbig.

=== City structure ===
The town encloses the historical town centre and a housing estate formerly named &quot;Siedlung Heimat&quot;, built in the early 1930s.

== History ==

The first written document mentioning &quot;Frates de Radegiz&quot; dates from 1244. In the following centuries, the ownership changed a few times, which was mentioned in some documents. In 1612, Radegast became a princely office. In 1727 the village received market and city rights from Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau, but the city rights were not exercised until 1852. From 1685 to 1688, a dam was built in the lowland of the river Fuhne between Radegast and Zörbig, which created an important trade-route between the cities of Magdeburg and Leipzig. In 1688 a boundary stone named the &quot;Theure Christian&quot; was set at this route. It marked the boundary between the former countries of Saxony and Anhalt-Dessau. In 1702 Radegast became a market-town, and in the same year the building of Radegast&#x27;s first church began. The church-tower collapsed in 1752 and was rebuilt subsequently. Two historical guesthouses were built at that time; both of them exist today.
From 1780 on a counterfeiter named Ziervogel did his foul work in the town, until he was imprisoned in 1786. In 1820 the imperial post office was opened. In the first years of its existence it was a simple post station for the town of Radegast and the villages Wehlau, Lennewitz, Riesdorf, Cosa, Fernsdorf, Station Weißandt, Priesdorf and Cösitz. In 1929 a telephone exchange was installed. The post office was closed on April 6, 1999.
In the following years the town expanded. The number of inhabitants was 885 in 1867. Already in 1859 a liqueur factory was founded, followed by a sugar-refinery in 1860, where up to 120 people worked at its best times. In 1930 the refinery was closed and most of the buildings were pulled down, but some of them exist until today.
In 1871 an oak tree was planted at the market-place as a symbol for the end of the war between Germany and France, which lasted from 1870 to 1871. The tree called &quot;Friedenseiche&quot; (&quot;oak of peace&quot;) is a mark of Radegast today and a natural landmark. Two years later, in 1873, the fire-brigade of Radegast was founded. In 1874 the nave of the church was rebuilt. The tower of the church was raised to a height of 35 m.
A railway was opened in 1897 and extended in the following years, but at the end of World War II the railway history of Radegast came to an end because the railway was disassembled as reparation payment to the Soviet Union. Since 1939 it had transported goods but no more passengers between the towns of Radegast and Zörbig.
Culture developed in the small town: In 1911 a football team named &quot;Britannia&quot; was founded, followed by a gardeners&#x27; club in 1919. In 1925, 911 people lived in the town. Also in this year a new town hall was established. In 1934 the construction work on a new school house started. Only one year later the new school was inaugurated. Students were taught here until the late 1990s.
After World War II ended, a new sector of the economy was opened up, as the horse-breeding started at the Radegast domain in 1951. The Radegast stud farm created a lot of prize-winning, successful saddle and sports horses in its history which is rich on tradition. From 1991 on the stud farm was called &quot;Landgestüt des Landes Sachsen-Anhalt&quot; (&quot;official stud farm of Saxony-Anhalt&quot;), but in 1997 the farm was closed, and the &quot;Landgestüt&quot; moved to Prussendorf. In 1999 the Radegast stud farm was sold to private owners.

On April 1, 1994 Radegast joined the &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Gölzau-Görzig&quot;, which was renamed to &quot;Anhalt-Süd&quot; on the same date. Since January 1, 2005 it is called &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Südliches Anhalt&quot;.





=== Coat of Arms ===
The coat of arms of Radegast has a silver background and shows a red tower on the right side. Nearby the tower there is an ascending red wall with a closed golden gate. Upon the wall there walks a black bear with a crown on its head and a collar around the neck. By giving Radegast the market and city rights, Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau also gave the town this coat of arms, which is similar to that of Bernburg. Older versions of the Radegast coat of arms seem to be reversed, because they showed the tower on the left side and the wall on the right.
== Culture and Tourism ==
Culture in Radegast bears the imprint of club and society activities until today. The Radegast society for local history and traditional costumes takes care of the traditions.
=== Museums ===
In Radegast there is a little parlour for local history where visitors can experience how people lived in Anhalt in the old days. The town also has a new-built false coinery. New coins with historical motives of Radegast are made for collectors every year.
=== Important historical buildings ===
One of the eldest verifications of Radegasts town history can be found at the former connection road between Radegast and Zörbig. It is an architectural monument, called the &quot;Theure Christian&quot;. But there are a lot of other historical buildings in Radegast as well: There are the two old guesthouses &quot;Prinz von Anhalt&quot; (&quot;Prince of Anhalt&quot;) and &quot;Das weiße Ross&quot; (&quot;The White Horse&quot;). Other historical monuments are the former imperial post station and the old railway station. The typical homogeneous method of constructionwhich was uses in old Anhalt, can be seen at the historical market place until today.

=== Parks ===
The &quot;Bürgerpark&quot; can be found at the settlement. Also the meadow of the river Fuhne and the near national park “Cösitzer Teich” invite wanderers and friends of mother nature.
=== Natural Monuments ===
The &quot;Friedenseiche&quot; in the middle of the market place – about 135 years old – is a natural monument. It is also a symbol for the end of war between Germany and France in the years 1870 to 1871.



=== Institutions ===
In Radegast can be found several institutions:
*a fire-brigade
*a savings bank
*a centre for leisure-time activities
*a police station
*a kindergarten
*a primary school and
*a teen&#x27;s club house

<doc id="873334" wikidata="Q922832" url="?curid=873334" title="The Dalek Invasion of Earth">
<text>The Dalek Invasion of Earth is the second serial of the second season in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Written by Terry Nation and directed by Richard Martin, the serial was broadcast on BBC1 in six weekly parts from 21 November to 26 December 1964. In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) discover that the Earth in the 22nd century has been occupied by Daleks. They work with a human resistance group to stop the Daleks from mining out the Earth&#x27;s core as part of their plan to pilot the planet through space.

The serial was commissioned following the success of the Daleks from the titular serial of the first season. The serial also marks the final regular appearance of Ford as Susan, having been dissatisfied with the character&#x27;s development. The writers had considered introducing Susan&#x27;s replacement within &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, but delays in contract renewals forced it to the following serial. The serial was the first major location shoot for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, with production taking place at Trafalgar Square, Westminster Bridge, and the Royal Albert Hall. The serial premiered with 11.4 million viewers, maintaining strong viewers across the six weeks. Contemporary reactions were positive, with many praising the return of the Daleks. Retrospective reviews were also positive, with particular praise directed at the first episode&#x27;s cliffhanger and Susan&#x27;s emotional departure, though the direction and pacing has been criticised. The serial later received several print adaptations and home media releases.

== Plot ==
After the TARDIS materialises, the First Doctor (William Hartnell), Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) surmise that they have landed in London, but find it in ruins. The Doctor and Ian stumble across an army of Robomen as a Dalek rises from the River Thames. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian onboard their saucer. Resistance members explain that the Daleks invaded Earth in the aftermath of a meteorite bombardment ten years prior.

Barbara and Susan are taken by refugees to a nearby shelter in an abandoned Underground station, where they meet resistance members who are planning an assault on the Daleks. The resistance leader, paraplegic scientist Dortmun (Alan Judd), has created a bomb to destroy the Daleks&#x27; outer casings. Susan, Barbara, and the resistance team attack the Daleks using the bombs, but they are ineffective. David (Peter Fraser) rescues the Doctor with Susan while Barbara gets separated. Ian hides as the saucer leaves for the Dalek mining operations. There, he escapes the Slyther (Nick Evans), a pet of the Black Dalek. He eventually hides in the mine and becomes trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. The Doctor, Susan, and David arrive at the cliffs overlooking the mine; the Doctor sends David and Susan to interfere with the Daleks&#x27; radio signals, while he climbs into the mine.

Dortmun sacrifices himself so that Barbara and Jenny (Ann Davies) can escape. They repair an old truck and head for the mining operations, but are reported to the Daleks when seeking shelter and sent to work. They are later brought before the Black Dalek and discover that the Daleks are drilling through the Earth&#x27;s crust to blow out its core, the intention being to replace the core with a device to pilot the planet like a spacecraft. The Daleks imprison Barbara and Jenny and set the explosive-filled capsule in position, but Ian jams the capsule half-way down the shaft. The Doctor frees Barbara and Jenny. With the radio signals damaged, Barbara and the Doctor order the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and the human slaves rebel. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes a volcanic eruption in England.

Back in London, David begs Susan to stay and marry him. Susan agonises, declaring her love but admitting that she must leave. The Doctor locks the TARDIS doors and bids Susan an emotional farewell, telling her that she deserves a normal life with David. He promises to return one day, and sets the TARDIS in motion. Susan drops her TARDIS key and leaves with David.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
In March 1964, story editor David Whitaker formally commissioned Terry Nation to write a serial for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s second season following the success of the Daleks from the titular serial of the first season, as well as Nation&#x27;s quick and effective work on &quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot;. The commission was made under the title &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks&quot;. Nation delivered the storyline for the serial in mid-April 1964 under the name &quot;The Return of the Daleks&quot;. The serial was retitled &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; by September; &quot;The Daleks in Europe&quot; appeared on some design material.

The Dalek models were refurbished for the serial, adding new eyestalks, a dish receptor, improved bases for movement, and a new pedal mechanism. The serial&#x27;s score was composed by Francis Chagrin. Around 18 minutes of incidental music for the first three episodes was recorded on 10 September 1964 at Maida Vale Studios, and 12 minutes for the final three episodes was recorded by five musicians on 8 October. Chagrin had conceived the music from the serial&#x27;s final scene some time before production and was &quot;dying to use it&quot;.

=== Casting and characters ===
On 12 March 1964, trade paper &quot;Television Today&quot; announced that Carole Ann Ford would depart from her role as Susan at the end of her contract, due to her dissatisfaction with the character&#x27;s development. Whitaker wanted a strong reason for Susan&#x27;s departure. To assist the story&#x27;s development, Ford and Hartnell were invited to stay with Nation and his wife over a weekend in August. In June 1964, head of serials Donald Wilson considered continuing the show without the character of Barbara, and with a younger actress for Susan. Delays by Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock to renew cast contracts meant that Susan&#x27;s replacement, then intended to be Jenny (originally known as Saida), could not be introduced in the serial. Director Richard Martin asked Ann Davies, who was cast as Jenny, if she would be available as a regular cast member, but he could not offer the role.

&quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; was the first speaking role of Nicholas Smith, who portrayed Wells. When Smith discovered he was only starring in one episode, he approached Martin; Martin asked him to return in a later episode to lead the human rebellion. Jean Conroy, who played one of the women in the woods in the fifth episode, died in a street accident on 14 November; the episode was broadcast posthumously.

=== Filming ===
&quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; was the first major location shoot for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Filming in 35mm began at Trafalgar Square at around 5:30 a.m. on 23 August 1964, consisting of shots of a deserted city. The design team added Dalek markings on landmarks such as Nelson&#x27;s Column, which police requested they remove. On the same day, filming took place at the statue of the Duke of Cambridge in Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, and the Royal Albert Hall. Martin had an agreement with police to vacate parts of central London for filming. Production resumed two days later on 25 August at the closed Wood Lane tube station. On 27 August, filming took place at Hammersmith Bridge. The location was chosen as it provided easy access to a hospital in case any performers swallowed river water; a taxi remained on standby. Dalek operator Robert Jewell could not gain enough traction to move his Dalek out of the river; the prop was attached to a cable to help. &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s first filming in a quarry took place on 28 August at Stone, Kent. Peter Hawkins and David Graham recorded Dalek voiceovers on 16 September.

Rehearsals for the first episode began on 14 September in White City, and weekly studio recording began on 18 September in Studio 1 at Riverside Studios. Though smaller overall than Lime Grove Studios, the complex used for previous serials, Riverside offered well-equipped and larger individual studios. During camera rehearsals for the third episode on 2 October, Hartnell injured his back when a prop ramp malfunctioned; when Martin apologised for the incident, Hartnell assured that he would be fine, but producer Verity Lambert insisted that he take several days to rest. Following discussions between Hartnell&#x27;s solicitors and the BBC&#x27;s, the BBC denied liability and paid for an X-ray. Hartnell was given a week off to recover, and the fourth episode underwent minor rewrites; Edmund Warwick doubled for Hartnell as The Doctor in the episode. The final episode was recorded on 23 October, marking a year of production since the filming of the show&#x27;s first serial; recording was delayed by half an hour due to some technical facilities being used by coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics. The production crew anticipated the final episode to be one of the most technically complex. The recording suffered some camera and sound issues, causing Hartnell to stumble some speeches. Hartnell omitted two lines from the Doctor&#x27;s closing speech to Susan. Ford recorded footage of the cast between camera rehearsals on her personal 8 mm film camera.

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast and ratings ===
&quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; was successful among viewers, with an additional four million viewers over the previous serial: the first episode received 11.4 million viewers, which rose to 12.4 the following week. The third and fourth episodes received 11.9 million, which dropped to 11.4 for the fifth episode, and rose again to 12.4 for the final. The first episode was the highest-rated BBC programme for northern England, and the third episode was the highest-rated for Wales and western England. The fifth episode was ranked 18th in the national ratings for the week, tied with ITV&#x27;s &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;. The Appreciation Index was highest for the first episode at 63, dropping to 59 for the second, third, and fourth episodes, and to 58 for the fifth, before rising to 60 for the final. The serial was shown at the Longleat 20th Anniversary Celebration on 3 April 1983, and the first episode was screened at the National Film Theatre on 29 October 1983. All six episodes were screened at the theatre on 5 January 1999.

=== Critical response ===
At the BBC Programme Review Board after the broadcast of the first episode in November 1964, director of television Kenneth Adam called it &quot;interesting&quot;. The Audience Research Report was higher than usual, with praise for the production and atmosphere; the primary complaint was the lack of Daleks, and some viewers felt it was too gruesome for children. The Review Board described the third episode as &quot;outstanding&quot;. The following week, executives of the Board felt that the show&#x27;s quality was consistently high. Adam indicated that Director-General Hugh Greene was eager to see the Daleks return in future stories. T. C. Worsley of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; praised the serial for creating a universal image for the Daleks. On 27 May 1965, critic Frederick Laws wrote that he had banned his children from watching &quot;Doctor Who&quot; due to the ending of the serial&#x27;s first episode.

Retrospective reviews of the serial were generally positive. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping praised the exterior sequences of the Daleks, though noted the less impressive production of the Slyther. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described the serial as &quot;one of the series&#x27; all-time greats&quot;, with impressive scripting and location filming despite some clumsy direction; they also praised the &quot;poignant and moving&quot; final scene. In &quot;A Critical History of Doctor Who&quot; (1999), John Kenneth Muir found the serial to be one of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; darkest, and praised the location shooting and the characterisation of Susan, though noted some sexism in the Doctor&#x27;s final remarks and criticised some &quot;positively amateurish&quot; special effects.

In 2008, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; praised the supporting cast, location filming, and emotional ending, but noted the continuity errors concerning the Daleks and the production shortcomings as a result of the serial&#x27;s ambition. In a 2011 review, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Christopher Bahn criticised the serial&#x27;s slow pacing and the uninteresting concept of the Robomen, and noted that Susan&#x27;s departure lacked dramatic impact because the Doctor chose for her; however, he praised the first episode and its cliffhanger, and the characterisation of the Doctor. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of &quot;io9&quot; listed the first episode&#x27;s cliffhanger as one of the greatest in the show&#x27;s history. &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; was voted the best First Doctor story by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; readers in 2020; writer Nick Setchfield cited the atmosphere, character, and narrative as its greatest elements, and the first episode&#x27;s cliffhanger and Susan&#x27;s departure among its best moments.

== Commercial releases ==
Terrance Dicks used the camera scripts to adapt a novelisation of the serial, &quot;Doctor Who and the Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, published in March 1977 by Target Books as a paperback and Allan Wingate in hardback. The cover, designed by Chris Achilleos, was based on the film adaptation. The paperback was reissued with a blue variant of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; logo in 1980. The novelisation was included in &quot;Doctor Who: Dalek Omnibus&quot;, published in hardback by W. H. Allen. It was also published as one of the first &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot; by Star Books in August 1988. Target reissued the novel in 1990 with Alister Pearson&#x27;s artwork from the video release. The book was also published internationally: in Germany as &quot;Doctor Who: Kampf um die Erde&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who und das Komplott der Daleks&quot;, and in France as &quot;Doctor Who: Les Daleks Envahissent la Terre&quot;. An audio version of the novelisation was published by BBC Audiobooks in November 2009, read by William Russell with Dalek voices by Nicholas Briggs. It was included in AudioGO&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who – Invasion Earth!&quot; collection in October 2012.

The serial was released as a double-tape pack by BBC Video in May 1990. It was released on DVD in June 2003, with special features including audio commentary, documentaries, and Ford&#x27;s footage from the final day of recording. A collectors&#x27; edition box set, limited to 5,000 copies, was released at WHSmith in October 2005. The serial was included in &quot;The Dalek Collection&quot; box set, released by BBC Worldwide on Amazon in January 2007. It was also released in issue 95 of &quot;Doctor Who DVD Files&quot; in August 2012. The serial was released on Blu-ray on 5 December 2022, alongside the rest of the show&#x27;s second season as part of &quot;The Collection&quot;.

== Film adaptation ==
In 1966, the serial was adapted as a film, &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot;, directed by Gordon Flemyng and written by Milton Subotsky and David Whitaker. The film stars Peter Cushing as Dr. Who and Roberta Tovey as Susan, with the roles of Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright being replaced by the new characters Tom Campbell (Bernard Cribbins) and Louise (Jill Curzon).

<text>Nathaniel Charles Rothschild (9 May 1877 – 12 October 1923) was an English banker and entomologist and a member of the Rothschild family. He is remembered for &#x27;the Rothschild List&#x27;, a list he made in 1915 of 284 sites across Britain that he considered suitable for nature reserves.

==Family==
Nathaniel Charles Rothschild was born in London into the Jewish Rothschild family, a prominent family of bankers. His parents, Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, and Emma Rothschild (&quot;née&quot; von Rothschild), were cousins. Charles boarded at Harrow School, which he found somewhat traumatising for incidents of bullying on account of his religion.

He worked as a partner in the family bank N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in London. He went to Rothschild&#x27;s Bank every morning; despite all his interest in science and in natural history, he never missed a day. He was also very interested in the gold refinery operated by Rothschild&#x27;s, and invented a variety of devices for collecting gold, and working on gold from a scientific point of view. He also became Chairman of the Alliance Assurance Company.

Charles predeceased his older brother Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild (1868–1937), who died without issue. The peerage therefore passed to Charles&#x27;s son Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild.

==Career==

===Entomology===
Like his zoologist brother Walter, Charles devoted much of his energies to entomology and natural history collecting. His enormous collection of some 260,000 fleas is now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum; he described about 500 new flea species. One of these, which he discovered and named, was the Bubonic plague vector flea, &quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;, also known as the oriental rat flea, which he collected at Shendi, Sudan, on an expedition in 1901, publishing his finding in 1903.

===Nature conservation===

Rothschild is regarded as a pioneer of nature conservation in Britain, and is credited with establishing the UK&#x27;s first nature reserve when (at the age of 22) he bought Wicken Fen, near Ely, in 1899. Wicken Fen was presented to the National Trust but the Trust declined to take Woodwalton Fen, near Huntingdon, which Rothschild bought in 1910, and this wetland, now a National Nature Reserve, was kept as a private nature reserve. In 1911 Rothschild built a bungalow at Woodwalton Fen as a base for fields trips, which still stands. During his lifetime he built and managed his Ashton Wold estate in Northamptonshire to maximise its suitability for wildlife, especially butterflies. 

He was concerned about the loss of wildlife habitats, and in 1912 set up the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the forerunner of the Wildlife Trusts partnership. He produced &#x27;the Rothschild List&#x27;, a schedule of the best 284 wildlife sites in the country, some of which were purchased as nature reserves; the list was published in 1915 by the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves.

===Public service===
As well as a Lieutenant of the City of London, Rothschild became a JP for the county of Northamptonshire in 1902. He served as High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1905.

==Personal life==
In 1907, Rothschild married Rózsika Edle von Wertheimstein (1870–1940), a descendant of an old Austrian-Jewish family that was ennobled long before the Rothschilds. She was born in 1870 at Nagyvárad, Hungary (now the Romanian city of Oradea), the daughter of a retired army officer, Baron Alfred Edler von Wertheimstein. Alfred&#x27;s sister Charlotte was married to . Rózsika was one of seven children and had been a champion lawn tennis player in Hungary.

After their marriage on 6 February 1907, they lived at Tring and in London. Rothschild, who worked in the family&#x27;s banking business, was a dedicated naturalist in his spare time: the young couple had met on a butterfly-collecting trip in the Carpathian Mountains. In the evening, they might go together to a concert or a dinner party, but he really preferred to sort out his butterflies. Together, they had four children:

* Miriam Louisa Rothschild (1908–2005), a zoologist
* Elizabeth Charlotte Rothschild (1909–1988), known as &quot;Liberty&quot;
* Nathaniel Mayer Victor Rothschild (1910–1990), known as &quot;Victor&quot;, 3rd Baron Rothschild.
* Kathleen Annie Pannonica Rothschild (1913–1988), known as &quot;Nica&quot;, a bebop jazz enthusiast and patroness of Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker

Suffering from encephalitis, in 1923 Rothschild died by suicide. He was found with his throat slit, locked alone inside his bathroom at his home, Ashton Wold. His suicide, when he was 46 years old, was a severe shock to his wife and four children. Rózsika died on 30 June 1940.

<doc id="873347" wikidata="Q708646" url="?curid=873347" title="Long Vacation">
<text>Long Vacation (, also known as ) is a Japanese television drama series from Fuji Television, first shown in Japan from 15 April to 24 June 1996.

The show&#x27;s high ratings in Japan made Takuya Kimura popular in the Asia-Pacific region and is known as &quot;The King of Ratings&quot;. It also made Tomoko Yamaguchi a known actress in Japan.

The characters in the series have something in common: if not jobless, they can do no better than secure a temporary job. This is a portrayal of a time when Japan was plagued by deep recession, when its people suffered profound depression from constant failure to earn a stable income. The series also portrays how relationships are made and broken, and explores how people come to depend on each other for solace.

==Plot==
Minami and Sena meet when Sena&#x27;s apartment-mate, Asakura, jilts Minami on their wedding day. Minami learns from Sena that Asakura has left, whereabouts unknown. Sena allows Minami to move into the apartment, since she is penniless, having given all her money to Asakura, and cannot pay the rent on her apartment.

This is the beginning of a romance between Sena and Minami. Minami and Sena confide in and console each other about their relationship problems and their lack of success in life. Sena has a crush on his junior, Ryoko. However, Ryoko does not feel the same, instead, she falls for Minami&#x27;s little brother Shinji.

Minami meets a professional photographer, Sugisaki, who proposes marriage. Although Sugisaki fits Minami&#x27;s ideal, she feels unsure about her feeling. Meanwhile, Sena has a chance of winning a piano competition and going to Boston, joining the symphony orchestra. After he wins the contest, he proposes Minami to marry and go with him to Boston.

==Reception==
When the series debuted in Japan, it was so popular with the female audience that the expression was used to highlight its fanbase. This was because the series was broadcast on Monday evenings. The episodes had an average rating of 29.5% of viewers, with the final episode reaching 36.7%. According to a research study conducted by NHK in 2009, the bulk of viewers were those who were teenagers (13 or older), at 40% of viewers, the second group were from those in their twenties at 34%. 

The series was popular with viewers in Hong Kong thanks to pirated VCD copies sold there before the show was legally broadcast.

On 11 November 2019, Fuji TV announced that photos and props from the show were on display at Fuji TV&#x27;s Headquarters in Odaiba to highlight the most popular dramas viewed through the Heisei Era in an exhibit until January 2020.

According to &quot;Television, Japan and Globalization&quot;, the themes of finding happiness are embodied through Minami when she mentions of her right to seek happiness by herself instead of getting married. This view is centered on people&#x27;s lives when they look for existential meaning.

<text> is a Japanese web portal. It was the most-visited website in Japan, nearing monopolistic status.

According to &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, as of 2012, Yahoo! Japan had a footprint on the internet market in Japan. In terms of use as a search engine, however, it has never surpassed Google. The company is the second largest search engine used in Japan as of July 2021, with a market share of 19% behind Google&#x27;s 77%.

The Yahoo! Japan search engine was a directory-type search engine, similar to Yahoo! in the United States. A crawler-type search engine was used as well, and as the popularity of the crawler-type search engine gradually increased, after October 3, 2005, Yahoo! Japan began utilizing only the crawler-type engine. On June 29, 2017, Yahoo! Japan announced that the directory-based search engine &quot;Yahoo! Category&quot;, which had been in operation since its establishment, would be abolished on March 29, 2018.

As a crawler-type search engine, Yahoo! Japan initially used technology from the Japanese company Goo, which used Google&#x27;s technology. The company later switched to using Yahoo Search Technology (YST), developed by Yahoo! in the US. In addition to serving as a standard search engine, Yahoo! Japan partnered with Twitter to provide real-time search for tweets. It also receives data feeds from partner companies; Cookpad and Naver information is displayed in search results. Yahoo! Search Custom Search was discontinued on March 31, 2019.

==History==
Yahoo! and SoftBank formed Yahoo! Japan in January 1996 to establish the first web portal in Japan. Yahoo! Japan went live on April 1, 1996. Yahoo! Japan was listed on JASDAQ in November 1997. In January 2000, it became the first stock in Japanese history to trade for more than ¥100 million per share. The company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 2003 and became part of the Nikkei 225 stock market index in 2005.

Yahoo! Japan acquired the naming rights for the Fukuoka Dome in 2005, renaming the dome as the &quot;Fukuoka Yahoo! Japan Dome&quot;. The &quot;Yahoo Dome&quot; is the home field for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, a professional baseball team, majorly owned by SoftBank.

Since 2010, Yahoo! Japan&#x27;s search engine has been based on Google&#x27;s search technology. In exchange, Google receives user activity data from Yahoo! Japan&#x27;s various products.

In 2017, Verizon Communications completed its acquisition of Yahoo&#x27;s core internet business for approximately $4.83 billion in cash. Yahoo&#x27;s operating business, which included popular products like Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Finance, and Tumblr, was merged with Verizon&#x27;s existing media subsidiary AOL to form a new subsidiary called Oath (later renamed Verizon Media).

However, the acquisition did not include Yahoo&#x27;s stakes in Alibaba Group, Yahoo Japan, or other minority investments. These assets remained under Yahoo, which was renamed Altaba and became a publicly traded investment company. Importantly, Yahoo Japan, which had operated as a separate joint venture, was not affected by Verizon&#x27;s acquisition of Yahoo&#x27;s core business. Yahoo Japan continued to use the Yahoo brand and operate independently.

The deal marked the end of Yahoo&#x27;s run as an independent company after over 20 years. Despite the acquisition, Yahoo Japan remained a separate entity, maintaining its own branding and operations distinct from Verizon&#x27;s ownership of Yahoo&#x27;s U.S. business.

Yahoo Japan&#x27;s services are not available in the European Economic Area and the UK since 6 April 2022, due to &quot;excessive regulatory burden&quot;.

Yahoo Japan, whose partnership with Google on search engine technology is set to expire in 2025, is considering switching to South Korean company Naver&#x27;s search engine technology.

===Design===
Yahoo! Japan continues to use a site design similar to the one used internationally prior to 2007, as well as the red Yahoo logo that was used by the international Yahoo brand before 2013. The company has maintained a consistent look and feel over the years, even as the international Yahoo brand has evolved.

==Services==
Yahoo! Japan currently offers various web-based services and apps for its customers, including the following:
* Ymobile: Ymobile Corporation (ワイモバイル株式会社), stylized Y!mobile, is a subsidiary of Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank Group Corporation that provides mobile telecommunications and ADSL services. The current CEO of the company is Ken Miyauchi. It was formed in 2014 through the merger of Willcom and eAccess, and uses the Y! moniker brand from Yahoo! Japan, which is partly-owned by SoftBank.
* Yahoo! Japan Mail: maintains the classic look of Yahoo! Mail, but remains a separate service operated in Japan. Another notable change is the 10 GB storage limit, in contrast to Yahoo! Mail&#x27;s 1 TB of storage and its former unlimited-storage offering.
* Yahoo! Japan Auctions (ヤフオク！): Japan&#x27;s largest Internet auction service. Previously known as Yahoo! Auction and Yafuoku.
* Yahoo! Japan T-Point: A rewards program that allows users to earn and redeem points for goods or cash.

<text>A113 and its variants are an inside joke and Easter egg in media developed by alumni of California Institute of the Arts, referring to the classroom used by graphic design and character animation students.

==History==
Students who have used the classroom include John Lasseter, Tim Burton, Michael Peraza, and Brad Bird. It has appeared in several Disney films and almost every Pixar movie.

Brad Bird first used it for a license plate number in the &quot;Family Dog&quot; episode of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;: &quot;I put it into every single one of my films, including my &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes—it&#x27;s sort of my version of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld&#x27;s &#x27;Nina&#x27;.&quot; It also appears in &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the SPA Studios animated film &quot;Klaus&quot; (2019). The first movie Bird used it in was &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; (1987), in which he worked on as an animator. It can be seen as The Master&#x27;s apartment address when Toaster and his friends knock on the door. It also appears in &quot;&quot; on an agent&#x27;s poison ring and in the script when Ethan Hunt requests evac at rendezvous point Alpha 113.

Brad Bird&#x27;s film &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; (2015) was produced by A113 Productions.

In &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, when the cameras on Truman&#x27;s set are shown, one is labeled A113.

The series finale of the children&#x27;s show &quot;Arthur&quot; features a door labeled &quot;A-113&quot;.

<text>Jason Carl Gardener, (born 18 September 1975) is a retired British sprint athlete. A fast starter from the blocks, he won an Olympic gold medal leading off Great Britain in the 4 x 100 metres relay at the 2004 Olympic Games, and is also the 2004 World Indoor Champion, and a four-time European Indoor champion, at 60 metres.

==Athletics career==
Gardener was born in Bath, Somerset to a Jamaican father and British mother, and started his career at the World Junior Championships in 1994, where he was placed second in the individual 100 m and bettered this to take his first gold medal as part of the 4 × 100 m relay team.

Joining the senior ranks, and coached by Malcolm Arnold for his entire career, Gardener took another silver in the 60 m, at the European Indoor Championships of 1998. He was not chosen for the relay team, which took gold.

In 1999 he took bronze at the World indoors in the 60 m, breaking the British record. and later that year saw him run 9.98 s breaking the 10 second barrier for the first time in the 100 m. He was also part of the national record breaking 4 × 100 m relay team along with Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish, and Dwain Chambers that they set in Seville, Spain running 37.73 seconds.

2000 saw Gardener go one better in the European indoor 60 m taking gold as well as breaking the national 50 m record with a time of 5.61 s. Unfortunately he became injured during the summer and although making it to Sydney for the Olympics he did not progress through the early rounds.

He retained his European indoor title in 2002 as well as a 4 x 100 m Commonwealth Games gold medal.

2003 saw another World indoors bronze despite being hampered by a hamstring injury but the following year he bettered this to take the gold, his first world individual title ahead of the fancied Shawn Crawford of the US.

Gardener made the squad for the 2004 Summer Olympics where he competed in the 100 m and won the gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay with Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis in a 38.07 s, their season&#x27;s best and a narrow upset win over the United States.

In March 2007, Gardener won his fourth European Indoor 60 m gold after fears that he may have to miss defending his title as his wife, Nancy, was due to give birth.

Gardener&#x27;s last professional race was a 4 x 100 m relay at the London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace on 3 August 2007. His team failed to finish this race.

On 17 October 2013, it was announced that Gardener would take part in the 100m Sprint for Faith organised by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Italian Sports Centre, as part of the Catholic Church&#x27;s Year of Faith.

In 2017 he became a Honorary Doctor of Laws at the University of Bath.

==Bobsleigh==
In 2008 Jason took part in a project to qualify four athletes from diverse sports in the British 2 Man Bobsleigh Championships, after just two weeks of training. Along with World Champion track cyclist Craig MacLean, Rugby World Cup winner Dan Luger and Commonwealth Decathlon champion Dean Macey, he attempted to complete two runs down the course at Cesana Pariol in Italy (site of the 2006 Winter Olympics) to gain qualification to the finals. Selected as pusher for driver Macey, he succeeded in finishing in sixth place overall, as well as being the highest placed novice pair. The story was filmed for the BBC and broadcast in February 2009. Jason declined an offer to try and qualify for the next Winter Olympics in 2010.

==Education==
Gardner was educated at Moorlands Primary School, Beechen Cliff School and the City of Bath College. He later graduated from Bath Spa University.

Port Hamilton was surveyed in 1845 by British naval officer Sir Edward Belcher in HMS &quot;Samarang&quot; and was named after the then secretary of the Admiralty, Captain W. A. B. Hamilton, and beecame renowned for its strategic importance by others, such as Russian Vice-Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin, who visited the islands several times and obtained permission from natives in 1857 to establish a coal depot, though due to delays in the delivery of the coal, the plan was abandoned.
Although the United States Secretary of the Navy &quot;in 1884 urged the establishment of a naval station at Port Hamilton, off the southern Korean coast, and although it appears that such facilities were offered by the Korean government, nothing was done.&quot;

In April 1885, Port Hamilton was occupied by three ships of the British Royal Navy on orders from the Admiralty in what is known as the Port Hamilton Incident. This was to forestall Russian advances in the face of the Panjdeh Incident in Afghanistan. Port Hamilton served as a counterbalance to the Russian naval base at Vladivostok. By occupying Port Hamilton, the British could prevent Russian advances in east Asia, and block Russian naval activity in the Korea Strait. The British built a few buildings and defensive works and introduced pheasants to the islands. Permission was obtained from China for a cable to be landed at Saddle Island (at the mouth of the Yangtze River). From there, the cable could be connected to the main telegraphic network at Shanghai, thus enabling telegraph communication with Port Hamilton.

After the Russian threat had diminished the British demolished the base and left on 27 February 1887, though they continued to frequent the islands, in one case burying a young sailor there. The visits were less frequent after 1910, when the Japanese Empire annexed Korea.

Until the end of World War II, a Japanese graveyard stood in Port Hamilton. When Japanese claims to the islands were specifically renounced in the Treaty of San Francisco, the Japanese graves were removed, but the British graveyard of ten British soldiers remains up to this day and has become a tourist attraction. Personnel of the British embassy have visited on occasion to pay their respects. The British Ambassador visited most recently in May 2021.

Ten British sailors and marines are buried on the islands including two sailors from HMS &quot;Albatross&quot; who were killed in March 1886 when their gun exploded, and a young sailor, Alex Wood from HMS &quot;Albion&quot;, who died in 1903.

<text>Dame Miriam Louisa Rothschild (5 August 1908 – 20 January 2005) was a British natural scientist and author with contributions to zoology, entomology, and botany.

==Early life==
Miriam Rothschild was born in 1908 in Ashton Wold, near Oundle in Northamptonshire, the daughter of Charles Rothschild of the Rothschild banking family of England of Jewish bankers and Rózsika Edle Rothschild (&quot;née&quot; von Wertheimstein), a Hungarian sportswoman, of Austrian-Jewish descent. Her brother was Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild and one of her sisters (Kathleen Annie) Pannonica Rothschild (Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter) would later be a bebop jazz enthusiast and patroness of Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker.

Her father had described about 500 new species of flea, and her uncle Lionel Walter Rothschild had built a private natural history museum at Tring. By the age of four she had started collecting ladybird beetles and caterpillars and taking a tame quail to bed with her. World War I broke on the eve of Miriam&#x27;s sixth birthday in 1914, while the Rothschilds were holidaying in Austro-Hungary. They hurried home on the first westward train but, unable to pay, had to borrow money from a Hungarian passenger who commented &quot;This is the proudest moment of my life. Never did I think that I should be asked to lend money to a Rothschild!&quot; Her father took his own life when she was 15, after which she became closer to her uncle. She was educated at home until the age of 17, when she demanded to go to school. She thence attended evening classes in zoology at Chelsea College of Science and Technology and classes during the day in literature at Bedford College, London.

==Personal life==

During World War II, Rothschild was recruited to work at Bletchley Park on codebreaking with Alan Turing and was awarded a Defence Medal by the British government for her efforts. Additionally, she pressed the UK Government to admit more German Jews as refugees from Nazi Germany. She arranged housing for 49 Jewish children, some of whom stayed at her home at Ashton Wold. The estate also served as a hospital for wounded military personnel, including her future husband, Captain George Lane. Lane, a Hungarian-born British soldier, had changed his name from Lanyi in case of enemy capture. They had six children, four biological: Mary Rozsiska (1945–2010), Charles Daniel (born 1948), Charlotte Teresa (born 1951) and Johanna Miriam (born 1951); and two adopted. The marriage was dissolved in 1957 but the pair remained on good terms.

Rothschild was a vegetarian and had a close connection to her pets and wild animals that she befriended. Rothschild supported many social causes including animal welfare, free milk for children in schools, and gay rights by contributing to the Wolfenden Report which resulted in decriminalising &quot;homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private&quot;.

==Research==
During the 1930s Rothschild made a name for herself at the Marine Biological Station in Plymouth, studying the mollusc &quot;Nucula&quot; and its trematode parasites (Rothschild 1936, 1938a, 1938b).

Rothschild was a leading authority on fleas. She was the first person to work out the flea&#x27;s jumping mechanism. She also studied the flea&#x27;s reproductive cycle and linked this, in rabbits, to the hormonal changes within the host. Her New Naturalist book on parasitism (&quot;Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos&quot;) was a huge success. Its title can be explained as: external parasites (e.g. fleas), internal parasites (e.g. flukes) and others (the cuckoo is a &#x27;brood parasite&#x27;). Along with Professor G. Harris, Rothschild determined that myxomatosis, a virus affecting tapeti and brush rabbits, was spread by fleas, not mosquitoes as previously understood. The Rothschild Collection of Fleas (founded by Charles Rothschild) is now part of the Natural History Museum collection and her six-volume catalogue of the collection (in collaboration with G. H. E. Hopkins and illustrated by Arthur Smith) took thirty years to complete.

In addition to her work on fleas and other parasites, Rothschild studied insects in the order Lepidoptera. Specifically, she was interested in chemical ecology and mimicry. To learn more about mimicry and its role in Lepidopteran predation by birds, Rothschild adapted greenhouses on her Ashton Wold estate to serve as aviaries for owls and other potential predators. This led to further work to identify the compounds synthesized by insects such as Burnet moth and collaboration with Tadeusz Reichstein to show that a monarch butterfly&#x27;s toxicity comes from milkweed, its larval host plant. It also resulted in work to demonstrate the importance of plant-derived carotenoids in insect coloration. Rothschild discovered that Large white cabbage butterfly caterpillars fed a diet without carotenoids did not match their background as they typically would and Monarch butterfly caterpillars&#x27; pupae had silver threads instead of gold.

Another area of Lepidoptera research that Rothschild pursued was that of the production of antibiotics by butterflies. This work was initially inspired by observations Rothschild made during an anthrax outbreak in the 1930s, but did not begin in earnest until around 60 years later. Rothschild drafted a manuscript on the subject and the results were eventually published 12 years after her death.

Rothschild was a member of the Oxford genetics school during the 1960s, where she met the ecological geneticist E.B. Ford.

Rothschild authored books about her father (&quot;Rothschild&#x27;s Reserves – time and fragile nature&quot;) and her uncle (&quot;Dear Lord Rothschild&quot;). She wrote about 350 papers on entomology, zoology and other subjects.

Later in her career, Rothschild grew interested in hay meadow restoration. In response to a comment that it would take 1,000 years to reproduce a medieval meadow, she said &quot;I could make a very good imitation in ten...it took me fifteen.&quot; She developed multiple seed mixes on her Ashton Wold estate, including one she called &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;. Another seed mix was used by Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, on his Highgrove Estate.

==Awards/honours==
In 1973. Rothschild was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She received honorary doctorates from eight universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, and was an Honorary Fellow of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. She gave the Romanes Lecture for 1984–5 in Oxford. Rothschild was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1985 and was granted the title of Dame Commander of the British Empire in 2000.

Rothschild was a pioneer among women in entomology and became the first woman trustee of the Natural History Museum (1967–1975), the first woman president of Royal Entomological Society (1993–1994), the first woman to serve on the Committee for Conservation of the National Trust, and the first woman member of the eight-member Entomological Club.

In 1986 the John Galway Foster Human Rights Trust was established; in 2006 the name of the trust was expanded to The Miriam Rothschild &amp; John Foster Human Rights Trust. This funds an annual lecture on human rights. She is also honoured by the endowed Professorship in Conservation Biology in her name at University of Cambridge.

==Philanthropy==
Rothschild founded the &#x27;Schizophrenia Research Fund&#x27; in 1962, in honour of her sister Liberty after Liberty was diagnosed and hospitalized with schizophrenia. The Schizophrenia Research Fund is an independent registered charity formed &quot;to advance the better understanding, prevention, treatment and cure of all forms of mental illness and in particular of the illness known as Schizophrenia&quot;. In March 2006, following Miriam&#x27;s death, the name of the Fund was changed in her memory to the &#x27;Miriam Rothschild Schizophrenia Research Fund&#x27;.

The pioneer of British Art Therapy, Edward Adamson and his partner and collaborator, John Timlin, were regular visitors to Ashton Wold. Between 1983 and 1997, the influential Adamson Collection of 6,000 paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics by people living with major mental disorder at Netherne Hospital, created with Adamson&#x27;s encouragement in his progressive art studios at the hospital, was housed and displayed to the public in a medieval barn at Ashton. Rothschild was both a Trustee and, subsequently, Patron of the Adamson Collection Trust. The Adamson Collection is now almost all re-located to the Wellcome Library. All Adamson&#x27;s papers, correspondence, photographs and other material are currently being organised as the &#x27;Edward Adamson Archive&#x27;, also at the Wellcome Library.

<text>A manse () is a clergy house inhabited by, or formerly inhabited by, a minister, usually used in the context of Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist and other Christian traditions.

Ultimately derived from the Latin &quot;mansus&quot;, &quot;dwelling&quot;, from &quot;manere&quot;, &quot;to remain&quot;, by the 16th century the term meant both a dwelling and, in ecclesiastical contexts, the amount of land needed to support a single family.

Many notable Scots have been called &quot;sons (or daughters) of the manse&quot;, and the term is a recurring point of reference within Scottish media and culture. For example, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown was described as a &quot;son of the manse&quot; as he is the son of a Presbyterian minister.

When selling a former manse, the Church of Scotland always requires that the property should not be called &quot;The Manse&quot; by the new owners, but &quot;The Old Manse&quot; or some other acceptable variation. The intended result is that &quot;The Manse&quot; refers to a working building rather than simply applying as a name.

<text>Agnotozoa is a subkingdom of simple animals. It is one of the three animal subkingdoms, along with Parazoa and Eumetazoa. It is nearly synonymous with Mesozoa.

Agnotozoa was first used as one of the branches of the subkingdom Metazoa. It was then considered to contain only one group, Mesozoa.

More recently, some have used the name to refer to a subkingdom of three small phyla of simple animals without organs, Placozoa, Orthonectida, and Rhombozoa. They are known as &quot;simple&quot; though they have differentiated tissue, because that tissue is only organized in simple ways; for example, by being layered. The Orthonectida and Rhombozoa are grouped into the Mesozoa.

Biologists today generally do not use the taxon Agnotozoa because it is doubted that placozoans are closely related to mesozoans and that orthonectids and rhombozoans are related to each other. Even if the two are related, there is little need for another name in addition to mesozoa.

<doc id="873370" wikidata="Q17099635" url="?curid=873370" title="Chrysler PowerTech engine">
<text>The initial design development for the PowerTech V6 and V8 engine family was done by American Motors Corporation (AMC) and debuted in 1998 with credit to Chrysler. This was the first new V8 engine for Chrysler since the 1960s. The companion V6 was basically the V8 with two fewer cylinders, another concept that originated at AMC before the company joined Chrysler. These new engines had nothing in common with the Chrysler A engine V8s, nor the Jeep 4.0 L &quot;PowerTech&quot; I6 engine. 

A 4.7 L V8 came first, available in the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and a 3.7 L V6 version debuted in 2002 for the Jeep Liberty. The PowerTech V6 and V8 were direct replacements for Chrysler&#x27;s Magnum series in the early 2000s, and were also used in the Dodge Ram and started in the 2000 Dodge Durango. They were not used in any cars, but were reserved for truck and SUV use. They are also known as Next Generation Magnum in Dodge applications.

The PowerTech V6 and V8 engines were produced at the Mack Avenue Engine Complex in Detroit, Michigan. E85 compatible versions of some PowerTech engines were developed and used in numerous Chrysler vehicles. On April 9, 2013, the last 4.7 L engine was built; ending 15 years of production with over 3 million units built.

==4.7==
The 4.7-liter version was the first of this family, appearing in the 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The displacement is with a bore and a stroke of . It has a cast iron block and aluminum heads with two valves per cylinder. It uses chain-driven Single overhead camshafts, one in each head. It originally produced and of torque. The 4.7 L V8 is available with four speed and five speed automatic transmissions and a 5 speed manual transmission.

The PowerTech was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1999.

*1999–2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee
*2000–2007 Dodge Dakota
*2000–2009 Dodge Durango
*2002–2010 Dodge Ram 1500
*2006–2009 Jeep Commander
*2007–2009 Chrysler Aspen
*2006–2007 Mitsubishi Raider

===4.7 HO===
A &quot;High-Output&quot; version of the 4.7 L PowerTech engine, producing and of torque, was introduced in 2002, first appearing in the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited as an option and in the Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland as standard equipment.

This engine was discontinued after the 2008 model year, though the non high output 4.7L V8 engine continued to be available in all vehicles.

Applications:
*2002–2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee
*2007–2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee
*2007–2008 Dodge Dakota
*2007–2008 Dodge Ram 1500/Ram 1500

====2008 Revisions====
The 2008 Dodge Dakota and Ram pickup trucks, Dodge Durango and Chrysler Aspen SUV&#x27;s, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Jeep Commander came with a Corsair version of the FFV 4.7 L engine, with dual spark plugs per cylinder, a new slant / squish combustion system design, and 9.8:1 compression, raising power to and of torque. 
The 2008 4.7 also features other upgrades including a more aggressive camshaft profile, a throttle body, and an improved intake manifold with shorter runners. See Allpar&#x27;s page on the latest 4.7 L.

==3.7 EKG==
The EKG is a 3.7 L V6 version built in Detroit, Michigan. It displaces . The bore and stroke measure . It is a 90° V engine like the V8, with SOHC 2-valve heads. It utilizes a counter-rotating balance shaft mounted between the cylinder banks to deal with vibration problems of the 90-degree V6 design, as well as use a 30-degree split pin crankshaft to fire the cylinders every 120 degrees. Output is at 5200 rpm with of torque at 4000 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminum SOHC cylinder heads. It uses Sequential fuel injection, has roller followers, and features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods and an assembled reinforced plastic intake manifold.

The Chrysler 3.7 PowerTech engine used in the 2007 - 2012 Jeep Liberty KK used a wasted spark ignition system that uses one ignition coil to fire two cylinders.

<doc id="873375" wikidata="Q2471880" url="?curid=873375" title="William Russell (English actor)">
<text>William Russell Enoch (19 November 1924 – 3 June 2024) was an English actor who performed as both Russell Enoch and William Russell. His career on stage and screen spanned over seven decades and he first achieved prominence in the title role of the television series &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; (1956–1957). In 1963, he was in the original lead cast of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, playing the role of schoolteacher Ian Chesterton from the show&#x27;s first episode until 1965. 

Russell&#x27;s film roles include parts in &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (1956), &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) and &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). On television, he appeared as Ted Sullivan in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1992. In his later years, he continued his association with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and returned as Ian for a 2022 cameo in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;, 57 years after the character left, which won him a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the longest gap between TV appearances.

==Early life==
William Russell Enoch was born on 19 November 1924 in Sunderland, County Durham, to Eva Compston (née Pile) and Alfred James Enoch. He was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and Oxford University and became interested in acting at an early age. He was involved in organising entertainment during his national service in the Royal Air Force and then, after university, went into repertory theatre.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
In 1963, Russell was cast in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as science teacher Ian Chesterton, the Doctor&#x27;s first male companion, appearing in all episodes of the first two seasons of the programme except the last four.

Russell was one of the four original cast members of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, starring opposite William Hartnell as the First Doctor, Jacqueline Hill as Barbara Wright, Carole Ann Ford as Susan Foreman and later Maureen O&#x27;Brien as Vicki. His first involvement in the series took form in the pilot episode (not transmitted until 1991), which was later reshot and broadcast as the first episode of &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, the programme&#x27;s first serial. He eventually departed, alongside Hill, in &quot;The Planet of Decision&quot;, the final episode of &quot;The Chase&quot;, which served as the penultimate story of the second season.

It was intended that Russell would reprise the role of Ian in the 1983 story &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; alongside Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor for the twentieth season. Scheduling conflicts left him unavailable.

After leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1992, Russell had maintained his association with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, having lent his voice as a narrator to several of the audiobook releases of the lost 1960s episodes. He appeared in &quot;The Game&quot;, one of the continuing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio stories produced by Big Finish Productions. He also recorded readings for some of the CD audio adaptations of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story novelisations originally published by Target Books.

In 1999, Russell returned to the role of Ian for the VHS release of &quot;The Crusade&quot;, of which &quot;The Knight of Jaffa&quot; and &quot;The Warlords&quot;, the second and fourth episodes, respectively, are lost. He recorded several in-character scenes to camera, which helped to bridge the gaps between the existing episodes.

Russell also contributed to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD range, having participated in several audio commentaries and on-screen interviews since 2002.

In 2013, the BBC produced &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, a docudrama depicting the creation and early days of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as part of the programme&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary celebrations. Russell was a character in the drama and was portrayed by actor Jamie Glover. Russell himself had a cameo role, playing a BBC Commissionaire named Harry.

The same year, Russell portrayed both Ian and the First Doctor in the Big Finish audio play &quot;The Light at the End&quot;, produced to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary; aged 88, he became the oldest person to portray the Doctor, a record he held until March 2023, when Tom Baker portrayed the Fourth Doctor in the Big Finish audio series &quot;The Fourth Doctor Adventures&quot; at the age of 89.

Russell made a cameo appearance as Ian in the 2022 special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. With this, his final role, he won a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the longest gap between TV appearances.

==Personal life and death==
In 1953, Russell married Balbina Gutierrez. They had three children, Robert, Laetitia and Vanessa, and later divorced.

In 1984, he married his second wife, Etheline Margareth Lewis, a Barbadian Brazilian doctor. Their son, Alfred was born in 1988. Alfred is now an actor too, best known for playing Dean Thomas in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series and Wes Gibbins in the television series &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;. They performed together in the 2020 movie &quot;Executive Order.&quot;

Russell died at his home from pneumonia on 3 June 2024, at the age of 99.

==Filmography==

===Film===
Russell appeared in British films from 1950 onward, appearing in well-known productions such as &quot;They Who Dare&quot; (1954), &quot;One Good Turn&quot; (1955), &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963). He later played minor roles in &quot;Terror&quot; (1978), &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Death Watch&quot; (1979).
===Television===
Russell&#x27;s big break was the title role in &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; on ITV in 1956, which for sale to the American NBC network became the first UK television series to be shot in colour. He acted in many plays and TV series including &quot;Disraeli&quot;, &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (as Ted Sullivan, the short-lived second husband of Rita Sullivan). He had a small part in an episode of &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, as a late replacement for Wilfrid Brambell, who became impatient with delays to his scene and left the set before shooting it. He was the Duke of Gloucester in the &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; episode, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, and Lanscombe in a 2005 &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; episode, &quot;After the Funeral&quot;.

<text>Philip Morris USA is an American tobacco company. They are a division of the American tobacco corporation Altria Group. It has been the leading cigarette manufacturer in the U.S. since the late 20th century. Its major brands include Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Benson &amp; Hedges, Merit, and Parliament.

The company was incorporated in New York City in 1902 as Philip Morris &amp; Co. Ltd. In 1919 George J. Whelan, along with fellow shareholders Reuben M. Ellis and Leonard B. McKitterick, acquired the American division of the company and created Philip Morris &amp; Co. Ltd., Inc. In the 1950s it introduced innovations such as the flip-top box and filters for cigarettes. In 1972, it became the leading cigarette manufacturer in the United States in terms of sales, a position it continued to hold. In March 2008, Philip Morris International was split from Philip Morris USA.

== History ==
=== Creation ===

The company&#x27;s namesake Philip Morris was born in Whitechapel, United Kingdom in 1835, the son of a recent immigrant from Germany who had taken the name Bernard Morris. In 1847, the family opened a shop in London. Philip Morris cigarettes were first made in 1854, known as &quot;Philip Morris English Ovals,&quot; a non-filter brand of oval-shaped cigarettes that were manufactured in very limited quantities until discontinuation in 2017.

=== Early years ===
In 1902, Philip Morris &amp; Co. Ltd. was incorporated in New York City. George J. Whelan bought the American division of the company in 1919 and created Philip Morris &amp; Co. Ltd., Inc., along with fellow shareholders Reuben M. Ellis and Leonard B. McKitterick.

In 1929, the company made its first cigarettes in Richmond, Virginia, using an existing factory the company purchased. In 1933, this factory was racially integrated more than 30 years before the law required it. In 1938, the company offered preferred stock to ordinary buyers.

In 1924, Philip Morris began advertising Marlboros specifically to women. The cigarettes had &quot;new cork-tip filters housed in a flip-top box with a red roof design.&quot;
=== Radio and television sponsorship ===
In 1933, the company and its advertising agency, Milton Biow, searched for a &quot;living trademark&quot; to represent their brand, and chose Johnny Roventini, a midget bellhop at the Hotel New Yorker. Roventini called out the catchphrase &quot;Call for Philip Morris!&quot; in live appearances, and on the radio. The Philip Morris-backed radio programs, including, &quot;It Pays to Be Ignorant&quot;, &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot; and &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, all began with the phrase &quot;Johnny presents&quot;, and Roventini&#x27;s &quot;Call for Philip Morris!&quot;

From 1951 to 1955, Philip Morris sponsored the CBS sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz pitching the product often, and Philip Morris controlling the content of the program. In 1955, Philip Morris became an alternate sponsor with Procter &amp; Gamble, eventually bowing out altogether by the end of that year.

=== Acquisitions ===
In 1970, Philip Morris made the first of several acquisitions with the purchase of Miller Brewing Company. In 1985, Philip Morris Companies Inc. became a holding company and the parent of Philip Morris Inc. and bought General Foods. The acquisition of Kraft Foods came in 1988, after which Kraft and General Foods became Kraft General Foods.

Although it had begun investing in the homebuilder by 1969, Philip Morris purchased Southern California&#x27;s Mission Viejo Company in its entirety for $52 million during 1972. Philip Morris continued to hold on to this investment until 1997, finally selling the division off to J.F. Shea Company.

In the 1970s, in response to smokers&#x27; health concerns, Philip Morris introduced the &quot;Light&quot; cigarette — which was later found to be no safer than any others.

In 1976, Marlboro became the leading brand in the U.S.; Morris operated as the largest seller of tobacco in the U.S. and the second-largest in the world.

In 2001, Kraft Foods launched an initial public offering (IPO) for 11.1% of the company that took in $8.7 billion, making it the second-largest IPO in American history at the time.

In 2002, Miller Brewing and South African Breweries became SABMiller, the second-largest maker of beer in the world, though Philip Morris kept an interest in the merged company.

=== Altria ===
On January 27, 2003, Philip Morris Companies Inc. changed its name to Altria Group, Inc. Even under this new name, Altria continues to own 100% of Philip Morris USA (abbreviated PM USA).

In the fall of 2003, Philip Morris USA moved its headquarters from New York City to Richmond, Virginia. On March 30, 2007, the remaining 88.9% stake in Kraft Foods was spun off to shareholders. Philip Morris International was split from Philip Morris USA in March 2008. This has caused a drop in the needed cigarette production due to no need for export product. Philip Morris shut down its Concord, North Carolina, manufacturing facility in 2010 and moved all domestic production to Richmond, which now contains the largest Philip Morris plant in the world, producing 146 billion cigarettes in 2010.

In 2010, the FDA banned the use of &quot;Light&quot; for ventilated cigarettes because it misrepresented the products as a healthier cigarette, and Philip Morris switched to using colors to brand them to circumvent the rule.

== Brands ==
Philip Morris USA brands include Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Benson &amp; Hedges, Merit, Parliament, Alpine, Basic, Cambridge, Bucks, Dave&#x27;s, Chesterfield, Collector&#x27;s Choice, Commander, Lark, L&amp;M, and Players. As of December 27, 2018, Philip Morris also owns a minority stake in JUUL.

== Criminal activities ==
In 1994, CEO William Campbell lied under oath to Congress about the addictive properties of nicotine, while knowing that cigarettes caused negative health effects to consumers.

==Variation of meaning by geographical region==
The referent of the musical note B varies by location. See for a discussion on other differences in letter naming of the notes.

In the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Netherlands, as described above, B usually refers to the note a semitone below C, while B-flat refers to the note a whole tone below C.

However, in Germany, Central and Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia, the label B is sometimes used for what, above, is called B-flat, and the note a semitone below C is called H. This makes possible certain spellings which are otherwise impossible, such as the BACH motif and the DSCH motif (the latter of which also uses the &quot;S&quot; name for what in Anglophone would be E-flat).

<text>The New Glarus Brewing Company is an American brewery founded in 1993. Located in New Glarus, Wisconsin, it is an independently owned craft brewery, whose products can only be found in Wisconsin. New Glarus Brewing Company is the 15th largest craft brewer and 25th largest overall brewing company in the United States, by sales volume.

==History==
The New Glarus Brewing Company was founded in 1993 by Deborah Carey as a gift for her husband, Daniel. Before starting the New Glarus Brewing Company, Dan Carey was an experienced diploma master brewer.
The brewery began in an abandoned warehouse with used brewpub equipment. In 1997, Dan Carey acquired the copper kettles from a brewery in Germany that was slated to be demolished. When the retiring German brewmaster learned that his kettles could be repurposed, he sold all of his equipment worth an estimated value of $1 million to the Careys for its scrap value of just over $24,000 US. New Glarus Brewing Company brewed its first beer in October of that year and began selling its product in December. Today the company brews a variety of beers, with its Spotted Cow label leading in sales. New Glarus brewing employs about 90 people today.

The brewery made the choice to pull out of Illinois sales effective 2003 leading to the sale of New Glarus beer &#x27;Only In Wisconsin&#x27; today. The move was made due to insufficient capacity to fill both Wisconsin and Illinois markets.

In May 2006, New Glarus Brewing Company broke ground on a new $21 million facility on a hilltop on the south edge of the village of New Glarus. The facility was designed to look like a Bavarian village and has become a destination for tourists who visit New Glarus. The original facility drew an estimated 25,000 visitors annually, but the expanded facility likely will draw up to 150,000 people a year. Production at the company&#x27;s old facility had topped-out at over 65,000 barrels a year. The new facility was expected to increase production, and in 2014, New Glarus Brewing was on track to brew 165,000 barrels. A new cellar could give the facility the storage space to brew 300,000 barrels in a year. The expansion will enable the company to increase production of its &quot;Thumbprint&quot;, fruit, barrel-aged, and R&amp;D beers. Construction was completed on schedule, and the Hilltop brewery opened in 2008. In 2014, the brewery released its first beers from its wild fruit cave, a specialized addition to its original facility (commonly referred to as the Riverside Brewery) that incorporates wild yeasts and other microorganism used in brewing.

==Spotted Cow==
The company&#x27;s best-selling brand is Spotted Cow. First brewed in 1997, Spotted Cow is a cask-conditioned farmhouse ale. New Glarus brews about 45,000 barrels of the beer a year, which accounts for about 40% of all the beer New Glarus makes a year. Spotted Cow has been the best-selling draft beer in the state for a number of years and is considered one of the most well-known beers in Wisconsin. Spotted Cow is one of New Glarus&#x27; unfiltered brews, meaning the brewer&#x27;s yeast is still in it. The brewer&#x27;s yeast will sometimes settle at the bottom of bottles. Spotted Cow has a 4.8% ABV. New Glarus owners Deborah and Dan Carey said the name Spotted Cow was actually inspired by sheep on a trip to England. The beer reached #1 on the list of the top 100 beers of all time by the Cold Cans podcast.

==Other beers==

The &quot;Wisconsin Belgian Red&quot;, a fruity Belgian lambic-style ale brewed with Montmorency cherries from Door County, Wisconsin, has won awards in beer competitions around the world, and has ranked in the 100th percentile (highest possible average rating) among the critical beer drinkers at RateBeer.com. The &quot;Uff-da Bock&quot;, which is a bit stronger than most bocks, is also popular.

New Glarus Brewing Company brews five beers that are available year-round. In addition, the company produces seven seasonal varieties, including a winter Coffee Stout, lighter summer offerings like Dancing Man Wheat, and a fall Staghorn Oktoberfest. &quot;Thumbprint Series&quot; beers are released at the brewers discretion (usually 4 times per year). These are limited-release brews by owner/brewmaster Dan Carey. There are also limited brewery only releases called the &quot;R&amp;D Series&quot; sold in 500 ml. bottles. Some of their beers have rather unusual names, like Stone Soup, and Pumpkin Pie Lust.

==Distribution==
New Glarus beers are distributed exclusively in Wisconsin by 17 independent wholesalers. Many grocery and convenience stores in Wisconsin carry Spotted Cow and a few other varieties, and many Wisconsin bars have Spotted Cow on tap. Wisconsin Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart are available only in four packs of 12 oz bottles; the remaining brews are sold in standard 12-fl oz (U.S.) bottles, in six- and four-packs or cases, and in quarter- and half-barrels. From 1998 to 2002, the company&#x27;s brews were also sold in Illinois, with a majority of its sales in the Chicago area. New Glarus actually pulled Spotted Cow from Illinois shelves in 2002 because the company was struggling to meet demand for it in Wisconsin. Deborah Carey also said the often messy &quot;pay to play&quot; approach, sometimes the only route to get a beer on bar/restaurant taps in major U.S. markets, further supported the brewery&#x27;s limited distribution.

In 2009, a New York City bar was raided and fined for illegally selling Spotted Cow. In 2015, a bar in Maple Grove, Minnesota, also was caught illegally selling Spotted Cow after the establishment&#x27;s owner allegedly purchased kegs in Wisconsin and took them back to Minnesota for retail sale.

==Awards==
New Glarus Brewing Company has been one of the most award-winning brewers of its size. It won two bronze medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Spotted Cow has won a variety of awards over the years, including Best Drink in Wisconsin in 2009 by Bon Appetit magazine.

<doc id="873391" wikidata="Q383204" url="?curid=873391" title="Plantar fascia">
<text>The plantar fascia or plantar aponeurosis is the thick connective tissue aponeurosis which supports the arch on the bottom (plantar side) of the foot. Recent studies suggest that the plantar fascia is actually an aponeurosis rather than true fascia. It runs from the tuberosity of the calcaneus (heel bone) forward to the heads of the metatarsal bones (the bone between each toe and the bones of the mid-foot).

==Anatomy==


The plantar fascia is the thick central portion of the fascia investing the plantar muscles. It extends between the medial process of the tuber calcanei and the proximal phalanges of the toes. It provides some attachment to the flexor muscles of the toes.

Distally, the plantar fascia becomes continuous with the fibrous sheaths enveloping the flexor tendons passing to the toes. At the anterior extremity of the sole - inferior to the heads of the metatarsal bones - the plantar aponeurosis forms the superficial transverse metatarsal ligament.

=== Structure ===
The plantar fascia is made up of predominantly longitudinally oriented collagen fibers. There are three distinct structural components: the medial component, the central component (plantar aponeurosis), and the lateral component (see diagram at right). The central component is the largest and most prominent.

=== Development ===
In younger people the plantar fascia is also intimately related to the Achilles tendon, with a continuous fascial connection between the two from the distal aspect of the Achilles to the origin of the plantar fascia at the calcaneal tubercle. However, the continuity of this connection decreases with age to a point that in the elderly there are few, if any, connecting fibers. There are also distinct attachments of the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon to the calcaneus so the two do not directly contact each other. Nevertheless, there is an indirect relationship whereby if the toes are dorsiflexed, the plantar fascia tightens via the windlass mechanism. If a tensile force is then generated in the Achilles tendon it will increase tensile strain in the plantar fascia. Clinically, this relationship has been used as a basis for treatment for plantar fasciitis, with stretches and night stretch splinting being applied to the gastrocnemius/soleus muscle unit.

==Function==
The plantar fascia contributes to support of arch of the foot by acting as a tie-rod, where it undergoes tension when the foot bears weight. One biomechanical model estimated it carries as much as 14% of the total load of the foot. In an experiment using cadavers, it was found that failure of the plantar fascia averaged at loads of 1189 ± 244 newtons (121 ± 24 kgf or 267 ± 55 lbf). Failure most often occurred at the proximal attachment to the calcaneus, which is consistent with the usual location of symptoms (i.e. in plantar fasciitis). Complete rupture or surgical release of the plantar fascia leads to a decrease in arch stiffness and a significant collapse of the longitudinal arch of the foot. By modeling it was predicted such conditions would result in a 17% increase in vertical displacement and a 15% increase in horizontal elongation of the foot when it was loaded at . Surgical release also significantly increases both stress in the plantar ligaments and plantar pressures under the metatarsal heads. Although most of the figures mentioned above are from either cadaver studies or investigations using models, they highlight the relatively large load the plantar fascia is subjected to while contributing to the structural integrity of the foot.

===Gait===
The plantar fascia also has an important role in dynamic function during gait. It was found the plantar fascia continuously elongated during the contact phase of gait. It went through rapid elongation before and immediately after mid-stance, reaching a maximum of 9% to 12% elongation between mid-stance and toe-off. During this phase the plantar fascia behaves like a spring, which may assist in conserving energy. In addition, the plantar fascia has a critical role in normal mechanical function of the foot, contributing to the &quot;windlass mechanism&quot;. When the toes are dorsiflexed in the propulsive phase of gait, the plantar fascia becomes tense, resulting in elevation of the longitudinal arch and shortening of the foot (see 3A). One can liken this mechanism to a cable being wound around the drum of a windlass (see 3B); the plantar fascia being the cable, the metatarsal head the drum, and the handle, the proximal phalanx.

==Clinical significance==
===Plantar fasciitis===

* Plantar fasciitis is an often painful degenerative process of the plantar fascia.
** Calcaneal spur (heel spur) is a small calcified bone extension (osteophyte) located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus or on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. The condition is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period of time. It may also be related to ankylosing spondylitis, typically in children.

===Other===
* Plantar fibromatosis is a relatively uncommon non-malignant thickening of the plantar fascia.
* Psoriatic arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that may affect the plantar fascia.
* Plantar fascial rupture/tear is a relatively uncommon painful tearing of the plantar fascia. The tear can be full or partial.

<text>Ashley Fraser Giles (born 19 March 1973) is a former English first-class cricketer, who played 54 Test matches and 62 One Day Internationals for England before being forced to retire due to a recurring hip injury. Giles played the entirety of his 14-year first-class career at Warwickshire County Cricket Club.

Giles started his career as a fast bowler before an early injury forced him to become a slow left-arm spinner. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 1993, but it was 1996 when he gained a regular place in the side, winning the NBC Denis Compton Award for being &#x27;The Most Promising Young Player&#x27; at the club. Giles was awarded his One Day International debut against Australia in May 1997, and 36 wickets in the 1998 season led to his first Test match against South Africa, although it would be a further two years before he would play another Test for England.

He did not have the most fluent bowling action and was unable to turn the ball a huge amount, although at , he was able to use his height to extract plenty of bounce. As a right-handed batsman, Giles scored three first-class centuries, but his highest international score was only 59, an innings that helped England win The Ashes in 2005. Between November 2000 and the emergence of Monty Panesar in 2006 (during his first prolonged injury lay-off), Giles was England&#x27;s first-choice spin bowler, although he was constantly having to justify his selection. This came to a head in 2004 when Giles considered retirement before a match-winning 9-wicket haul against the West Indies gave him the confidence to perform at the highest level.

Following his playing career Giles has had spells as white-ball Head Coach and Director of Cricket with England, as well as holding similar roles as county level with Warwickshire and Lancashire. In 2023 he joined Worcestershire County Cricket Club as chief executive.

==Domestic career and influences==
Ashley Giles spent his early years living in Woking, attending the Kingfield First and Middle Schools. Giles benefited from a cricket-loving teacher, and became involved with District and County Cricket at Under-9 level. After his parents moved to Ripley, Surrey, he attended the George Abbot School in Guildford, completing his GCSEs and A-levels. The Giles family was heavily involved with Ripley Cricket Club: Ashley&#x27;s father, brother Andrew, cousins and uncles all played for the club, as did both paternal and maternal grandfathers previously. Giles soon moved into the Saturday 2nd XI, opening the bowling with close friend Ian Ward. At this stage, both players were aspiring fast bowlers, and a deadly force for Surrey Under-19s. Giles moved to Guildford Cricket Club, working under coach Brian Ruby alongside future professionals Darren and Martin Bicknell.

Giles advanced through the county age-groups, and toured Barbados with Surrey Young Cricketers in 1990/91. While at Guildford, an injury forced Giles to try bowling spin, which brought him some success. Giles made his debut for the Surrey Second XI in 1990, and was named Surrey Young Cricketer of the Year in 1991. The following season, he played one further match for Surrey but they were unable to offer him a professional contract. After an initial trial with Dennis Amiss, Giles was awarded a one-year contract with Warwickshire County Cricket Club.

Between 1992 and 1995, Giles played the majority of his games for Warwickshire Second XI, scoring over 2,500 runs and taking 165 wickets in this period. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Kent in May 1993; his second match was against Durham later that season. In September 1993, he made his List A debut against the touring Zimbabweans, his first wicket being that of Grant Flower, although it would not be until the tail-end of the 1995 season before Giles began to cement his place in the Warwickshire side taking 16 wickets at an average of 22.12 (in 6 matches). In 1996 Giles won the NBC Denis Compton Award, and before his debut for the full national side in 1998 he toured Australia, Sri Lanka and Kenya with the England A team.

==International career==
===England debut to 2004===
Giles played winter cricket in South Africa for Vredenberg &amp; Saldanha (1992–95) and Avendale (1995–96). On 2 July 1998, Giles made his Test debut against South Africa, and took 1 for 106 in 36 overs. He then went on to tour Australia in the One Day squad. On 31 December, it was announced that Giles was to step out of the One Day match between the ODI squad and the Bradman XI, and into the Test squad for the final Test match in Sydney. He was chosen in light of Australia&#x27;s selection of Shane Warne, Colin Miller and Stuart MacGill, England captain Alec Stewart stating that the selection of Giles gave England another option.

Giles took part in England&#x27;s 2000—01 tour of Pakistan, establishing himself as &quot;England&#x27;s No. 1 slow bowler.&quot; He suffered an achilles tendon injury in February which affected his bowling, conceding 83 runs from his 19 overs, with Duncan Fletcher citing the injury as the cause of this. Giles returned, however, to take part in the Test matches. The press at the time suggested that Giles was to match Muttiah Muralitharan in wicket taking, but he dismissed this idea. His tendon injury recurred in April, however, and was rested for six weeks.

Giles then impressed during India&#x27;s tour of England in the winter of 2001. In Domestic Cricket, Giles scored 96 from 139 balls for Warwickshire against Middlesex, as well as taking the wicket of Andrew Strauss. He went on to take three more wickets as Middlesex reeled. During the 2002 tour of Australia, Giles took six wickets at Brisbane, but he was forced to end his tour when Steve Harmison injured Giles&#x27; wrist during nets practice. In the winter of 2003, Giles took eight wickets against Sri Lanka in the first Test, and hit 18 and 17 to keep England in the series with a draw. Giles was later named for the 2004 touring squad to the West Indies.

===Hundredth Test wicket===
Until 2004, his most successful bowling had been in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and that year started with an uninspiring performance in the Caribbean. However, in July 2004 he recorded match-figures of 9–210 in the first Test at Lord&#x27;s (including his 100th Test wicket, Brian Lara), which won him the Man of the Match award. He followed this with his best Test-figures of 9–122 in the second Test at Edgbaston, and was instrumental in England beating West Indies twice. In that series he gained the nickname &quot;King of Spain&quot;, after a set of mugs ordered in 2000 (for his testimonial year) were erroneously printed with that slogan, instead of &quot;King of Spin&quot;. There were originally only two of these mugs produced, one of which Giles used for his coffee in the dressing room (this mug was subsequently stolen), and another on display in the club shop. However, after the error was publicised, a further two hundred mugs were produced with King Juan Carlos on the other side and were snapped up by Warwickshire fans.
Fans during the Ashes series of 2005 also regularly sang &quot;Y viva España&quot; in Giles&#x27; honour. Giles was, until that successful run of form, also gently derided by commentators: the BBC&#x27;s Test Match Special commentator Henry Blofeld famously labelled him a &quot;Wheelie bin&quot; because of his trundling run-up, much to Giles&#x27; disgust. Blofeld however, insisted that the moniker was not malicious. (It was originally bestowed on Giles by &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist David Hopps.)

===2005 Ashes===
In 2005, he was named as one of five cricketers of the year by Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack. In the 2005 Ashes series, Giles captured the wickets of all of the top Australian batsmen at least once during the series. He hit the winning runs in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge to give England a 2–1 lead. He contributed a Test-best 59 runs and a century partnership with Kevin Pietersen to ensure the draw in the final Test at The Oval and a 2–1 series victory. However, his ten wickets in the series came at a high average of 57.80.

===2006, injury and retirement===
In February 2006, a recurring hip injury forced Giles out of both the Test and ODI sections of England&#x27;s tour to India that year. His number 8 spot was taken first by left-arm spinner Ian Blackwell and then fast bowler Liam Plunkett, and Giles admitted that left-arm spinner Monty Panesar was another threat to his place. In the final Test, veteran off-break bowler Shaun Udal replaced him, with some success. In the Tests of summer 2006, whilst Giles was injured for the entire season, Panesar played against both Sri Lanka and Pakistan, with conspicuous success. On 24 April 2006, Giles gave an interview stating that although he had at one point feared his career might be in danger, he was now &quot;a lot more confident and happy&quot; after being diagnosed with a sportman&#x27;s hernia. At the end of October 2006, after spending time in India with the England Champions Trophy squad, Giles was passed fit for selection, and took Panesar&#x27;s place in the team for the first Test at Brisbane. However, he was dropped for the third Test in the series, with Panesar reclaiming his place.

Giles flew home from the 2006 Ashes tour of Australia on 1 December in order to care for his wife who had a brain tumour. He was not selected for England&#x27;s 2007 World Cup squad, nor in their 2007 summer performance squad. On Warwickshire&#x27;s pre-season tour he suffered some hip discomfort, which revealed a need for an operation. It kept him out for most of the 2007 English county series, and on 9 August, Giles officially announced his retirement from all forms of cricket, following advice from doctors in light of his injury.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement, in September 2007, Giles became Warwickshire&#x27;s director of cricket, replacing Mark Greatbatch, ahead of Dermot Reeve. In November two months later, Giles was named the official spin coach in the England Performance Programme. On 18 January 2008, Giles was added to a new four-man panel, along with Peter Moores and James Whitaker, headed by Geoff Miller, which replaced David Graveney in the role of national selector for the England team, the latter having been removed from the position and reinstated as a national performance manager.
Led Warwickshire to the Division One County Championship in September 2012, Division Two County Championship 2008, CB40 2010 &amp; Pro 40 Division Two 2009.

On 28 November 2012 the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed Ashley Giles would become England&#x27;s limited overs Head Coach taking charge of the Twenty20 and One Day International teams.

Following his departure from that post in April 2014 he spent the summer months as match analyst for ESPN, playing in the Warwickshire Premier League for Nuneaton CC in return for a charitable donation and setting a world record by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro to play in the highest game of cricket ever played (also for charity).

In October 2014 he was appointed as cricket director and head coach of Lancashire County Cricket Club. In December 2016, he was appointed as sport director of Warwickshire County Cricket Club

He became the Managing Director of men&#x27;s cricket for England in December 2018. It was announced on 2 February 2022 that he was leaving the role following a poor Ashes cricket performance over the winter of 2021. During his time in office he was associated with the controversial rotation of players and the merging of the chairman of selectors and the coach.

Giles was appointed as Chief Executive by Worcestershire, beginning in the role on 3 July 2023.

==Personal life==
Giles is a resident of Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire and was named an &#x27;Honorary Citizen&#x27; of the town by the mayor after the 2005 Ashes success. The award was created for him, as he did not meet the usual criteria to become a Freeman. Giles was awarded an MBE in the 2006 New Year Honours for his role in the successful Ashes-winning squad. He is married to the Norwegian Stine (née Osland), with whom he has two children, Anders Fraser and Matilde Louise. He is a lifelong supporter of Queens Park Rangers F.C.

==Awards==
* NBC Denis Compton Award 1996 and 1997
* Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005
* Awarded the MBE in 2005

<doc id="873397" wikidata="Q3128028" url="?curid=873397" title="Harvey Danger">
<text>Harvey Danger was an American indie/alternative rock band. It was formed in 1992 in Seattle, Washington, by Aaron Huffman and Jeff J. Lin, who were both journalism students at the University of Washington. Drummer Evan Sult and singer Sean Nelson were brought into the band in 1993, solidifying the band&#x27;s lineup for the remainder of their initial existence.

After performing a variety of shows in the local area and recording a number of demos with producer John Goodmanson, Harvey Danger released their debut album, &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; (1997) through the Arena Rock Recording Company. Although the album was not a success initially, its second track, &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;, began receiving nationwide radio airplay, and soon after, the band signed with Slash Records, a subsidiary of the major label London Recordings. Slash/London reissued &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; and &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; as a single in April 1998 to widespread commercial success, with the album eventually becoming certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999. However, the band grew increasingly uncomfortable with their association with &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; and their perceived status as a one-hit wonder, and sought to distance themselves from the song and their early lo-fi sound with their subsequent musical output.

Following a series of corporate restructurings that saw the band change record labels, Harvey Danger issued their second studio album, &quot;King James Version&quot; (2000), which showed the band moving in a more artistic direction influenced by the works of Radiohead and Frederic Tuten. Although its sole single &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; became a minor hit, the album performed very poorly commercially, and its failure led to the band breaking up in April 2001. It has since attracted a cult following.

Nelson, Huffman and Lin reformed Harvey Danger in April 2004, with Michael Welke replacing Sult on drums. In 2005, the band issued their third and final album, &quot;Little by Little...&quot;, which featured a more piano-driven sound. The band&#x27;s decision to release the album as a free BitTorrent/download through their website attracted significant attention and helped renew the band&#x27;s popularity. On May 28, 2009, Harvey Danger announced that they had amicably decided to disband, and the band played its final show at the Crocodile Cafe in Seattle on August 29, 2009.

==History==

===Early years (1992–1995)===

Harvey Danger began in 1992 with University of Washington classmates Jeff Lin and Aaron Huffman deciding &quot;it might be fun to start a band.&quot; Huffman and Lin, who were both student journalists on the staff of &quot;The Daily of the University of Washington&quot; student newspaper, took the name &quot;Harvey Danger&quot; from a phrase graffitied onto the wall of the newspaper&#x27;s office. Lin and Huffman played house parties and bars as a duo under the Harvey Danger name until 1993, when they invited Evan Sult to be their drummer. Despite his complete lack of drumming experience, Sult agreed, bringing along his own similarly inexperienced classmate Sean Nelson. Nelson was also a colleague of Lin and Huffman at &quot;The Daily&quot;&#x27;s arts and entertainment section &quot;The Glass Onion&quot;.

The foursome played their first show on April 21, 1994 at the now-defunct Lake Union Pub; Sult and Nelson, both under 21, were only permitted entry during the set. That summer, the band moved into Nelson&#x27;s student house together and began holding band practices in the basement. More shows at the Lake Union Pub and other low-rent Seattle clubs followed, leading to exposure in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;.

As the band began playing more shows at increasingly reputable venues, their songwriting gained momentum. In 1994, the band produced a six-song demo tape, sold at shows for $3.

===&quot;Merrymakers&quot; and initial success (1996–1998)===
When three-quarters of the group became unemployed in 1996, they decided to devote yet more attention to the band, moving to another house and renting a rehearsal space. Their shows continued to improve, and the band became regular weekend performers at the Crocodile Cafe.

The band recorded a three-track demo tape with producer John Goodmanson, which failed to draw attention from major labels, but found its way to Greg Glover, a London Records intern who ran his own small label, The Arena Rock Recording Company, Glover expressed interest in releasing a 7&quot; single, and Harvey Danger provided him with an additional three songs—including &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;—also recorded with Goodmanson. On the strength of these, Glover agreed to bankroll a full-length album.

In 1996, shortly before the band&#x27;s national success, Nelson was hired as a reporter for &quot;The Stranger&quot; newspaper in Seattle. Nelson opted to balance his journalism and music careers, and he continues to write and edit for the newspaper to the present day.

The group was working on their first album between March and June 1996. &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; was released July 29, 1997, to local critical acclaim. The record performed well on college radio charts, and it sold steadily in Seattle and New York, among other cities. By late 1997, however, the band felt as though the record had lost its momentum and the group began to contemplate breaking up. Shortly before taking January 1998 off to contemplate their future, Nelson gave a copy of &quot;Merrymakers&quot; to KNDD DJ Marco Collins. Within weeks, &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; had become KNDD&#x27;s most-requested song. The band toured extensively from March through December 1998, playing headlining and support gigs with some of the most popular artists of the year and appearing at many radio festivals. Influential L.A. radio station KROQ-FM picked the track up, and stations across the country shortly followed suit. When Greg Glover of The Arena Rock Recording Company was hired at Slash Records, a subsidiary of London Recordings, Harvey Danger were signed to the label. &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; made &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top 40 and appeared in a number of films and television shows. Its video got heavy rotation on MTV and VH1. The song also became famous globally as one of the most memorable songs featured in the film &quot;American Pie&quot;, despite not being on the official retail soundtrack. It also appeared in the movie &quot;Disturbing Behavior&quot; and its trailer. More recently, the song was used as the opening theme to the British sitcom &quot;Peep Show&quot; for the second series and onwards. In August 2019, &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; was ranked No. 25 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Best Songs of the Nineties&quot; list.

The band had wanted to release the song &quot;Carlotta Valdez&quot; as the follow-up single to &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;, but they were overruled by Slash Records, who released &quot;Private Helicopter&quot; as a single instead in the fall of 1998. The single received lukewarm reception and did not reach any &quot;Billboard&quot; music chart. In December 1998, Harvey Danger began writing songs for their follow-up album.

===Delays and &quot;King James Version&quot; (1999–2001)===
Harvey Danger began production of their second album in March 1999 at Albert Grossman&#x27;s Bearsville Studios, near Woodstock, New York. Slash/London was unusually uninvolved in the recording process, a harbinger of what was to come. After three weeks of recording at Bearsville and several more weeks of recording and mixing in Seattle and Los Angeles, the band submitted the record, &quot;King James Version&quot;, to their label, and waited. What the band refers to as &quot;elaborate corporate reshuffling&quot; began almost immediately after they finished their album: mergers and acquisitions among record labels left them and their record in limbo for over a year, not knowing to whom they were signed, nor when &quot;KJV&quot; would be released.

Attempts to release the album on then-fledgling indie label Barsuk Records fell through due to legal complications, a tour with the Pretenders fell through due to lack of label support, and, just when the band was about to give up, newly reorganized London-Sire Records released &quot;King James Version&quot; on September 12, 2000. Reviews were strong, but buzz was almost nonexistent: sales of the album were slow, and the single &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; performed poorly on radio and MTV. For the album&#x27;s supporting tour, Nevada Bachelors guitarist Mike Squires was added as the group&#x27;s live guitarist as well as the Western State Hurricanes founder John Roderick on keyboard. Roderick would later fill in on bass when Huffman fell ill, days before a performance on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; with Craig Kilborn.

===Hiatus and reunion (2001–2004)===
Harvey Danger played a &quot;final&quot; show in Portland on April 21, 2001, seven years to the day after their first show, and quietly disbanded for an undetermined period.

During the hiatus Jeff Lin returned to school, Evan Sult relocated to Chicago and joined the band Bound Stems and Aaron Huffman formed the group Love Hotel. Sean Nelson recorded and toured with The Long Winters, the group formed by former Harvey Danger live member John Roderick, and worked on solo material, sometimes with Lin and Huffman (actually recording several unreleased songs, among them covers of songs written by Harry Nilsson for a future release entitled &quot;Nelson Sings Nilsson&quot;, eventually released in 2019 without Lin and Huffman&#x27;s contributions). He wrote for the weekly alternative Seattle newspaper, &quot;The Stranger&quot;; and became a partner in Barsuk Records and a DJ for Seattle&#x27;s KEXP-FM. The idea of reforming Harvey Danger was raised several times, but rejected.

In 2004, Nelson, Huffman, and Lin entered a studio together for the first time in three years to record two new song ideas, with Nada Surf&#x27;s Ira Elliot accompanying on drums. The session went so well that the trio agreed to begin writing music together—with &quot;no strings attached.&quot; Sult, busy in Chicago, was unable to return, but sent his blessing for Harvey Danger&#x27;s reincarnation.

April 21, 2004, saw both the tenth anniversary of Harvey Danger and their first show since 2001, in Seattle. With Nada Surf opening and Elliot again filling in on drums, the show also previewed songs that would be part of the new album: &quot;Moral Centralia,&quot; &quot;Wine, Women, and Song,&quot; and &quot;War Buddies.&quot; The band recruited Seattle-based drummer Michael Welke, formalized their return as a band, and performed with their new lineup at the Bumbershoot Festival in Seattle in the summer of 2004. The year ended with the self-release of a five-song EP, &quot;Sometimes You Have to Work on Christmas (Sometimes)&quot;.

===&quot;Little by Little...&quot; and breakup (2005–2009)===

In January 2005, Harvey Danger entered Robert Lang Studios to record their third album. Joining them again was Goodmanson, accompanied by Steve Fisk. The recording process ran smoothly, and &quot;Little by Little...&quot; was released on September 13, 2005, five years and one day after &quot;King James Version&quot;.

Citing &quot;a long-held sense that the practice now being demonized by the music biz as &#x27;illegal&#x27; file sharing can be a friend to the independent musician,&quot; Harvey Danger released their third album, &quot;Little by Little...&quot;, as a free download via BitTorrent a week after its release, and directly from the band&#x27;s website a week after that. Within two months of release, the album had been downloaded 100,000 times, while the first pressing of physical copies (packaged with a disc of bonus material) had nearly sold out.

Reviews of the album were mixed. Pitchfork Media gave the album 6.9 (of a possible 10); AllMusic granted 3.5 (of a possible 5); PopMatters wrote: &quot;If &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone&quot; is a rebellious kid kicking over trashcans in his neighborhood, then &quot;Little by Little&quot; seems to be that kid all grown up, taking out the trash, putting the lid on tightly, getting in his Jetta, and driving to work.&quot; Treble.com wrote: &quot;Little by Little is one of the most pleasantly surprising albums of the year and one that truly displays the intricate and clever songwriting of a band in its prime.&quot; Threeimaginarygirls.com said: &quot;Little By Little... deals with complex issues like politics, religion, and relationships on an intelligent level that&#x27;s both challenging and accessible.&quot; The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Cream and Bastards Rise,&quot; made Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;Hot List.&quot; It was also released as a downloadable song for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; video game series on October 7, 2008.

On July 25, 2006, Olympia-based label Kill Rock Stars re-released &quot;Little by Little...&quot; with a slightly altered track listing (songs on the bonus disc and main album swapped places). This release was much more widely available, and the band set out on its first national tour in five years in support of the album. On October 10, 2006, Barsuk Records released &quot;Little Round Mirrors&quot; as a maxi-single/EP with four B-sides.

On May 28, 2009, the band announced, &quot;After 15 years, three albums, hundreds of shows, and far more twists and turns than we ever imagined possible, we&#x27;ve decided to put Harvey Danger to rest. The decision is totally mutual and utterly amicable.&quot; Harvey Danger played eight farewell shows in August, the last three of them in Seattle. The band closed with the last song it wrote, &quot;The Show Must Not Go On&quot;.

===Post-breakup (2009–present)===

Since the band&#x27;s breakup, Nelson continued to write and edit for &quot;The Stranger&quot; alternative weekly newspaper, which he had done for most of the duration of the band&#x27;s career, until 2018. He now lives in Nashville, TN. He occasionally performs as a solo artist, having released the album &quot;Make Good Choices&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Nelson Sings Nilsson&quot;, an album of Harry Nilsson covers in 2019.

Jeff J. Lin works as a tech entrepreneur, having founded the photo sharing site Momento 360 in 2015. Evan Sult is now based in New York City and since 2013 has drummed for the indie rock duo Sleepy Kitty. Founding bassist Aaron Huffman died of respiratory failure due to cystic fibrosis on March 6, 2016, at age 43. His death was reported in &quot;The Stranger&quot; by Nelson.

In 2011, Harvey Danger released &quot;The Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; B-side collection and final single &quot;The Show Must Not Go On&quot; for free on their website.

&quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time on July 29, 2014, by the independent label No Sleep Records. The packaging for the &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; re-issue LP features new artwork, designed by Huffman, Sult and Nelson, using the iconic house from the original cover art now updated to reflect the passage of time, now surrounded by freeways and skyscrapers.

<doc id="873402" wikidata="Q52851" url="?curid=873402" title="Plantar fasciitis">
<text>Plantar fasciitis or plantar heel pain is a disorder of the plantar fascia, which is the connective tissue that supports the arch of the foot. It results in pain in the heel and bottom of the foot that is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin. The pain typically comes on gradually, and it affects both feet in about one-third of cases.
The cause of plantar fasciitis is not entirely clear. Risk factors include overuse, such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot, a tight Achilles tendon, and a sedentary lifestyle. It is unclear if heel spurs have a role in causing plantar fasciitis even though they are commonly present in people who have the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. Since inflammation plays either a lesser or no role, a review proposed it be renamed plantar fasciosis. The presentation of the symptoms is generally the basis for diagnosis; with ultrasound sometimes being useful if there is uncertainty. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.
Most cases of plantar fasciitis resolve with time and conservative methods of treatment. For the first few weeks, those affected are usually advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, and stretch. If this is not sufficient, physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If these measures are not effective, additional measures may include extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery.
Between 4% and 7% of the general population has heel pain at any given time: about 80% of these are due to plantar fasciitis. Approximately 10% of people have the disorder at some point during their life. It becomes more common with age. It is unclear if one sex is more affected than the other.

==Signs and symptoms==
When plantar fasciitis occurs, the pain is typically sharp and usually unilateral (70% of cases). Bearing weight on the heel after long periods of rest worsens heel pain in affected individuals. Individuals with plantar fasciitis often report their symptoms are most intense during their first steps after getting out of bed or after prolonged periods of sitting. Symptoms typically improve with continued walking. Rare, but reported, symptoms include numbness, tingling, swelling, and radiating pain. Typically there are no fevers or night sweats.

If the plantar fascia is overused in the setting of plantar fasciitis, the plantar fascia can rupture. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the bottom of the foot.

==Risk factors==
Identified risk factors for plantar fasciitis include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods, high arches of the feet, the presence of a leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.

Plantar fasciitis is commonly a result of some biomechanical imbalance that causes an increased amount of tension placed along the plantar fascia.

Achilles tendon tightness and inappropriate footwear have also been identified as significant risk factors.

==Pathophysiology==

The cause of plantar fasciitis is poorly understood and appears to have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the sole of the foot before inserting at the base of the toes and supports the arch of the foot.

Plantar fasciitis is a non-inflammatory condition of the plantar fascia. Within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic anatomical changes indicating that plantar fasciitis is due to a non-inflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar fascia rather than an inflammatory process.

Many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis in light of these newer findings. Repetitive microtrauma (small tears) appears to cause a structural breakdown of the plantar fascia. Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.

Disruptions in the plantar fascia&#x27;s normal mechanical movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) place excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity and seem to contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not due to the inflamed plantar fascia but maybe a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.

==Diagnosis==


Plantar fasciitis is usually diagnosed by a health care provider after consideration of a person&#x27;s presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the sole may elicit tenderness during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to excessive tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. Occasionally, a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound, or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.

Other diagnoses that are typically considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel pain in the context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to check for damage to the nerves or muscles.

An incidental finding associated with this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), which can be found in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.

===Imaging===
Medical imaging is not routinely needed. It is expensive and does not typically change how plantar fasciitis is managed. When the diagnosis is not clinically apparent, lateral view X-rays of the ankle are the recommended imaging modality to assess for other causes of heel pain, such as stress fractures or bone spur development.

The plantar fascia has three fascicles-the central fascicle being the thickest at 4 mm, the lateral fascicle at 2 mm, and the medial less than a millimeter thick. In theory, plantar fasciitis becomes more likely as the plantar fascia&#x27;s thickness at the calcaneal insertion increases. A thickness of more than 4.5 mm ultrasound and 4 mm on MRI are useful for diagnosis. Other imaging findings, such as thickening of the plantar aponeurosis, are nonspecific and have limited usefulness in diagnosing plantar fasciitis.

Three-phase bone scan is a sensitive modality to detect active plantar fasciitis. Furthermore, a 3-phase bone scan can be used to monitor response to therapy, as demonstrated by decreased uptake after corticosteroid injections.

===Differential diagnosis===
The differential diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, but not limited to, the following: calcaneal stress fracture, septic arthritis, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, metastasized cancers from elsewhere in the body, hypothyroidism, gout, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.

A determination about a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis can usually be made based on a person&#x27;s medical history and physical examination. When a physician suspects a fracture, infection, or some other serious underlying condition, they may order an X-ray to investigate. X-rays are unnecessary to screen for plantar fasciitis for people who stand or walk a lot at work unless imaging is otherwise indicated.

==Treatment==
===Non-surgical===
About 90% of plantar fasciitis cases improve within six months with conservative treatment, and within a year regardless of treatment.

The recommended first treatment is a four- to six-week course which combines three elements: daily stretching, daily foot taping (using a special tape around the foot for supporting the arch) and individually tailored education on choosing footwear and other ways of managing the condition.

Reduction in pain and stress on the plantar fascia can be done by strengthening the muscles in the foot that support the arches through barefoot exercising, without footwear, compared to exercising in common footwear.

If plantar fasciitis fails to respond to conservative treatment for at least three months, then extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) may be considered. Evidence from meta-analyses suggests significant pain relief lasts up to one year after the procedure. However, debate about the therapy&#x27;s efficacy has persisted. ESWT is performed with or without anesthesia though studies suggest giving anesthesia diminishes the procedure&#x27;s effectiveness. Complications from ESWT are rare and typically benign when present. Known complications of ESWT include the development of a mild hematoma or an ecchymosis, redness around the site of the procedure, or migraine.

The third line of treatment, if shockwave therapy is not effective after around 8 weeks, is using customised foot orthoses which can offer short-term relief from pain.

Affected people use further different treatments for plantar fasciitis but many have little evidence to support their use and are not adequately studied.

Other conservative approaches include rest, massage, heat, ice, and calf-strengthening exercises, weight reduction in the overweight or obese, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. The use of NSAIDs to treat plantar fasciitis is common, but their use fails to resolve the pain in 20% of people.

Corticosteroid injections are sometimes used for cases of plantar fasciitis that have proven resistant to more conservative measures. There is tentative evidence that injected corticosteroids are effective for short-term pain relief up to one month, but not after that.

Another treatment technique is known as plantar iontophoresis. This technique involves applying anti-inflammatory substances such as dexamethasone or acetic acid topically to the foot and transmitting these substances through the skin with an electric current. Some evidence supports the use of night splints for 1–3 months to relieve plantar fasciitis pain that has persisted for six months. The night splints are designed to position and maintain the ankle in a neutral position, thereby passively stretching the calf and plantar fascia during sleep.

===Surgery===
Plantar fasciotomy is a surgical treatment and the last resort for refractory plantar fasciitis pain. If plantar fasciitis does not resolve after six months of conservative treatment, then the procedure is considered as a last resort. Minimally invasive and endoscopic approaches to plantar fasciotomy exist but require a specialist who is familiar with specific equipment. The availability of these surgical techniques is limited as of 2012. A 2012 study found 76% of people who underwent endoscopic plantar fasciotomy had complete relief of their symptoms and had few complications (level IV evidence). Heel spur removal during plantar fasciotomy does not appear to improve the surgical outcome.

Plantar heel pain may occur for multiple reasons. In select cases, surgeons may perform a release of the lateral plantar nerve alongside the plantar fasciotomy. Possible complications of plantar fasciotomy include nerve injury, instability of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, fracture of the calcaneus, prolonged recovery time, infection, rupture of the plantar fascia, and failure to improve the pain. Coblation surgery has recently been proposed as an alternative surgical approach for the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis.

Gastrocnemius recession is a surgical procedure that involves lengthening the gastrocnemius muscle to reduce tension in the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia. This technique improves the ankle&#x27;s range of motion, reduces pain, and can help patients return to work, sports, and weight-bearing activities more comfortably. The procedure is particularly beneficial for individuals with limited ankle dorsiflexion (upward bending) due to tight calf muscles, which can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms.

===Unproven treatments===
Botulinum toxin A injections as well as similar techniques such as platelet-rich plasma injections and prolotherapy remain controversial.

Dry needling is also being researched for treatment of plantar fasciitis. A systematic review of available research found limited evidence of effectiveness for this technique. The studies were reported to be inadequate in quality and too diverse in methodology for a firm conclusion.

With a combination of plantar fasciitis stretching and the use of botulinum toxin showed an increase in improvement and functionability in patients.

==Epidemiology==
Plantar fasciitis is the most common type of plantar fascia injury and is the most common reason for heel pain, responsible for 80% of cases. The condition tends to occur more often in women, military recruits, older athletes, dancers, people with obesity, and young male athletes.

Plantar fasciitis is estimated to affect 1 in 10 people at some point during their lifetime and most commonly affects people between 40 and 60 years of age. In the United States alone, more than two million people receive treatment for plantar fasciitis. The cost of treating plantar fasciitis in the United States is estimated to be $284 million each year.

=== Prognosis ===
According to studies following patients with plantar fasciitis over several years, 20% to 75% of individuals no longer have any symptoms within a maximum of one year after the onset of symptoms.

Having a heel spur (bony protrusion at the heel) in addition to heel pain does not worsen the prognosis of recovery. Individuals with and without heel spurs recover at the same rate.

<doc id="873406" wikidata="Q237056" url="?curid=873406" title="Lydia Koidula">
<text>Lydia Emilie Florentine Jannsen ( – ), known by her pen name Koidula, was an Estonian poet. Her sobriquet means &#x27;(Lydia of) The Dawn&#x27; in Estonian. It was given to her by the writer Carl Robert Jakobson. She is also frequently referred to as &quot;Koidulaulik&quot; – &#x27;Singer of the Dawn&#x27;.

In Estonia, like elsewhere in Europe, writing was not considered a suitable career for a respectable young lady in the mid-19th century. Koidula&#x27;s poetry and her newspaper work for her populist father, Johann Voldemar Jannsen (1819–1890) remained anonymous. In spite of this, she was a major literary figure, the founder of Estonian theatre, and closely allied to Carl Robert Jakobson (1841–1882), the influential radical and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald (1803–1882), writer of the Estonian national epic, &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; (&quot;The Son of Kalev&quot;). Over time, she has achieved the status of the national poet of Estonia.

==Biography==

Lydia Jannsen was born in Vändra (Fennern), Estonia. The family moved to the nearby county town of Pärnu (Pernau) in 1850 where, in 1857, her father Johann Voldemar Jannsen started the first local Estonian language newspaper and where Lydia attended the German-language grammar school. The Jannsens moved to the university town of Tartu (Dorpat) in 1864. Any kind of expression of nationalism, including publication in indigenous languages, was a sensitive subject in the Russian Empire, however the rule of Czar Alexander II (1855–1881) was relatively liberal and Jannsen managed to persuade the imperial censorship to allow him to publish the first Estonian-language newspaper with nationwide distribution in 1864. Both the Pärnu local and the national newspaper were called &quot;Postimees&quot; (&quot;The Courier&quot;). Lydia wrote for her father on both papers besides publishing her own work. In 1873, she married Eduard Michelson, an army physician, and moved to Kronstadt (Russian naval base on an island near St. Petersburg). In 1876–78 the Michelsons visited Breslau, Strasbourg and Vienna. Koidula lived in Kronstadt for 13 years and albeit during that time she would spend the summers in Estonia, she reportedly never stopped feeling inconsolably homesick. Lydia Koidula was the mother of three children. She died from breast cancer on 11 August 1886. Her last poem was &quot;Enne surma — Eestimaale!&quot; (&quot;Before death, to Estonia!&quot;).

==Works==
Koidula&#x27;s most important work, &quot;Emajõe ööbik&quot;, (&quot;The Nightingale of the Emajõgi River&quot;), was published in 1867. Three years earlier, in 1864, Adam Peterson, a farmer, and Johann Köler, a fashionable Estonian portraitist living in Saint Petersburg, had petitioned the emperor for better treatment from the German landowners who ruled the Baltic provinces, equality, and for the language of secondary and higher education to be Estonian instead of German. Immediately afterwards they were taken to the police where they were interrogated about a petition that &#x27;included false information and was directed against the state&#x27;. Adam Peterson was sentenced to imprisonment for a year. Two years later, in 1866, the censorship reforms of 1855 that had given Koidula&#x27;s father a window to start &quot;Postimees&quot; were reversed. Pre-publication censorship was re-imposed and literary freedom was curtailed. This was the political and literary climate when Koidula started to publish. Nevertheless, it was also the time of the national awakening when the Estonian people, freed from serfdom in 1816, were beginning to feel a sense of pride in nationhood and to aspire to self-determination. Koidula was the most articulate voice of these aspirations.

German influence in Koidula&#x27;s work was unavoidable. The Baltic Germans had retained hegemony in the region since the 13th century, throughout German, Polish, Swedish and Russian rule and thus German was the language of tuition and of the intelligentsia in 19th century Estonia. Like her father (and all other Estonian writers at the time) Koidula translated much sentimental German prose, poetry and drama and there is a particular influence of the Biedermeier movement. Biedermeier, a style which dominated &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; art in continental Europe from 1815 to 1848, developed in the wake of the suppression of revolutionary ideas following the defeat of Napoleon. It was plain, unpretentious and characterised by pastoral romanticism; its themes were the home, the family, religion and scenes of rural life. The themes of Koidula&#x27;s early &quot;Vainulilled&quot; (&quot;Meadow Flowers&quot;; 1866) were certainly proto-Biedermeier, but her delicate, melodic treatment of them was in no way rustic or unsophisticated, as demonstrated in the unrestrained patriotic outpourings of &quot;Emajõe Ööbik&quot;. Koidula reacted to the historical subjugation of the Estonian people as to a personal affront; she spoke of slavery and the yoke of subordination as if from personal experience. By the time of the National Awakening in the 1860s, Estonia had been ruled by foreign powers – Danish, German, Swedish, Polish and Russian – for over 600 years. In this context, she was conscious of her own role in the destiny of the nation. She once wrote to a Finnish correspondent: &quot;It is a sin, a great sin, to be little in great times when a person can actually make history&quot;.

The Estonian literary tradition started by Kreutzwald continued with Koidula but whereas &quot;The Bard of Viru&quot; tried to imitate the &quot;regivärss&quot; folk traditions of ancient Estonian, Koidula wrote (mostly) in modern, Western European end-rhyming metres that had, by the mid 19th century, become the dominant form. This made Koidula&#x27;s poetry much more accessible to the popular reader. But the major importance of Koidula lay not so much in her preferred form of verse but in her potent use of the Estonian language. Estonian was, still, in the 1860s, in a German dominated Baltic province of Imperial Russia, the language of the oppressed indigenous peasantry. It was still the subject of orthographical bickering, still used in the main for predominantly patronising educationalist or religious texts, practical advice to farmers or cheap and cheerful popular story telling. Koidula successfully used the vernacular language to express emotions that ranged from an affectionate poem about the family cat, in &quot;Meie kass&quot; (&quot;Our Cat&quot;) and delicate love poetry, &quot;Head ööd&quot; (&quot;Good Night&quot;) to a powerful &quot;cri de coeur&quot; and rallying call to an oppressed nation, &quot;Mu isamaa nad olid matnud&quot; (&quot;My Country, They Have Buried You&quot;). With Lydia Koidula, the colonial view that the Estonian language was an underdeveloped instrument for communication was, for the first time, demonstrably contradicted.

==Drama==
Koidula is also considered the &quot;founder of Estonian theatre&quot; through her drama activities at the Vanemuine Society (Estonian: &quot;Vanemuise Selts&quot;), a society started by the Jannsens in Tartu in 1865 to promote Estonian culture. Lydia was the first to write original plays in Estonian and to address the practicalities of stage direction and production. Despite some Estonian interludes at the German theatre in Tallinn, in the early 19th century, there had been no appreciation of theatre as a medium and few writers considered drama of any consequence, though Kreutzwald had translated two verse tragedies. In the late 1860s, both Estonians and Finns started to develop performances in their native tongues and Koidula, following suit, wrote and directed the comedy, &quot;Saaremaa Onupoeg&quot; (&quot;The Cousin from Saaremaa&quot;) in 1870 for the Vanemuine Society. It was based on Theodor Körner&#x27;s (1791–1813) farce &quot;Der Vetter aus Bremen&quot;, (&quot;The Cousin from Bremen&quot;) adapted to an Estonian situation. The characterisation was rudimentary and the plot was simple but it was popular and Koidula went on to write and direct &quot;Maret ja Miina,&quot; (aka &quot;Kosjakased&quot;; &quot;The Betrothal Birches&quot;, 1870) and her own creation, the first ever completely Estonian play, &quot;Säärane mulk&quot; (&quot;What a Bumpkin!&quot;). Koidula&#x27;s attitude to the theatre was influenced by the philosopher, dramatist, and critic Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729–1781), the author of &quot;Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts&quot; (&quot;The Education of the Human Race&quot;; 1780). Her plays were didactic and a vehicle for popular education. Koidula&#x27;s theatrical resources were few and raw – untrained, amateur actors and women played by men – but the qualities that impressed her contemporaries were a gallery of believable characters and cognizance of contemporary situations.

At the first Estonian Song Festival, in 1869, an important rallying event of the Estonian clans, two poems were set to music with lyrics by Lydia Koidula: &quot;Sind Surmani&quot; (&quot;Till Death&quot;) and &quot;Mu isamaa on minu arm&quot; (&quot;My Country is My Love&quot;), which became the unofficial anthem during the Soviet occupation when her father&#x27;s &quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; (&quot;My Country is My Pride and Joy&quot;), the anthem of the Estonian Republic between 1921 and 1940, was forbidden. Koidula&#x27;s song always finished every festival, with or without permission. The tradition persists to this day.

==Memorial Museum of Lydia Koidula==

A branch of the Pärnu Museum, the museum gives an overview of the life and work of poet Lydia Koidula and her father Johann Voldemar Jannsen (author of the lyrics of Estonian anthem), important figures in Estonian national awakening period in the 19th century.
The Koidula museum is located in the Pärnu Ülejõe schoolhouse. The building was constructed in 1850 and has a unique interior. It was the home of Johann Voldemar Jannsen and the editorial office of the &quot;Perno Postimees&quot; newspaper until 1863, now it is under protection as a historical monument. Jannsen&#x27;s elder daughter, poet Lydia Koidula grew up in the house. It is the main task of the museum to keep alive the memory of Koidula and Jannsen and to introduce their life and work in the context of the period of national awakening in Estonia through the permanent exposition.

There is a monument of Lydia Koidula in the citycenter of Pärnu next to the historical building of Victoria Hotel on the corner of Kuninga and Lõuna street. The monument dates to 1929 and was the last work by Estonian sculptor Amandus Adamson. Finally, she was on the pre-euro 100 krooni banknote.

<text>Norton Commander (NC) is a discontinued prototypical orthodox file manager (OFM), written by John Socha and released by Peter Norton Computing (later acquired in 1990 by the Symantec corporation). NC provides a text-based user interface for managing files on top of MS-DOS. It was officially produced between 1986 and 1998. The last MS-DOS version of Norton Commander, 5.51, was released on July 1, 1998.

A related product, &quot;Norton Desktop&quot;, a graphical shell for MS-DOS and Windows, succeeded Norton Commander. It came in two variants, &quot;Norton Desktop for DOS&quot; and &quot;Norton Desktop for Windows&quot;.

==Background==
John Socha started work on Norton Commander in 1984; at the time, he called it &quot;Visual DOS&quot; or &quot;VDOS&quot;.

Norton Commander was easy to use because it had a constant view of two file manipulation objects at once. After starting the program the user sees two panels with file lists. Each panel can be easily configured to show information about the other panel, a directory tree, or a number of other options. At the bottom of the screen, Norton Commander displays a list of commands that are extended on demand by the CTRL and ALT keys. Thus, without heavy use of the mouse (although mouse functionality was integrated around version 3.0), the user is able to perform many file manipulation actions quickly and efficiently. Additionally, it also includes a built-in text file viewer (invoked with F3 key) and text file editor (invoked with F4 key).

Norton Commander was very popular during the DOS era and it has been extensively cloned. For example, the IntelliJ IDE used to include a &quot;Commander&quot; plugin that performed file manipulation using the same shortcut keys as Norton Commander but the plugin is now obsolete.

===Long filenames===
Windows 95 included a new graphical shell called Windows Explorer and supported long filenames (LFN). Symantec released Norton Commander 5.51 to support long filenames using the standard Windows APIs. In order to preserve LFNs while working in real mode, Norton Commander 5.51 required the use of a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) utility. Norton Commander did not have native support for LFNs in real mode and would truncate them.

===End of life===
According to former Peter Norton Group developer Mark Lawler, after Symantec had acquired Peter Norton Computing, Symantec had speculated Microsoft Windows would be a success, so the key PNC resources had been diverted, while new programmers for the Windows platform were hired. Enrique Salem (who eventually became Symantec&#x27;s CEO) led the development of a Windows shell replacement for Windows File Manager and Program Manager released as Norton Desktop for Windows.

==Norton Commander for Windows==
Norton Commander for Windows was a Windows 95 variant of the classical DOS file manager.

===1.0===
Version 1.0 was first released in 1996. It supported both Windows 95 and Windows NT.

This version fully integrated with Windows features such as the Recycle Bin and Quick View. Quick View feature was supported via the included basic Quick View Plus.

Version 1.02 added Windows 98 support.

===2.0===

Version 2.0 was released in 2000. It supports Windows 2000 and functions under Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. Installer included Network Utilities, Norton Commander Scheduler, and the Norton Commander.

Network Utilities allows for viewing devices and systems on network, connecting to remote systems, mapping network drives, network monitoring, and more.

Norton Commander is little changed from previous versions, and includes file compression/de-compression of various formats, network utilities access, disk cleanup, files and folder compare, FTP connection management, and more.

The last Windows version of Norton Commander was 2.01.

==Norton Commander for OS/2==
Version 1.0 was released in December 1992. It supports OS/2 2.0 with HPFS or FAT file system.

It does not include the command prompt found in other versions of Norton Commander.

In June 1993, Symantec lowered the price of Norton Commander for OS/2 to $49, and soon ceased sales.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 listed Norton Commander 2.0 for DOS as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that &quot;navigating through a crowded hard disk is a breeze&quot;.

==Norton Commander-inspired software==
There are many programs that follow the style of Norton Commander as created by John Socha. Examples are:

*ACE Archiver for DOS in the first versions had a NC-inspired interactive interface
*Altap Salamander for Windows
*BeFAR for BeOS
*Commander One for macOS
*Demos Commander for Unix and Linux
*Directory Opus for Amiga (1990) and Windows (2001)
*DOS Command Center (DCC) DOS and Win95 versions
*DOS Navigator for DOS
*Double Commander for Windows and Linux
*FAR Manager for Windows
*fman for Windows, Mac and Linux
*Ghost Commander for Android systems
*GNOME Commander for Unix-like systems
*HiFile for Windows, Mac and Linux
*Krusader for Unix-like systems
*Midnight Commander for Unix-like systems (including macOS) and Windows
*muCommander for Java platform
*Music on Console for Unix-like systems; actually a music player
*PowerDesk by Avanquest, of which an evaluation version of Version 4 is included in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kits
*Stereo Shell for DOS
*The DOS Controller by Søren Kragh
*Total Commander for Windows
*Volkov Commander for DOS
*WinNC for Windows 10
*RAR archive manager used to have Norton Commander-like interface, the last version with that interactive file manager interface look-alike was DOS version 2.50
*Xfolders for OS X

== References in popular culture ==

* &quot;Norton Commander&quot; is a song released by the Montreal indie group, Men I Trust. While the song contains no literal references to the Norton Commander file manager, it is speculated that the song&#x27;s subject matter of comfort and familiarity relate to the familiarity and reliability of the software.
* A mobile game called &quot;Progressbar95&quot; features an unlockable gamemode called &quot;Progress Commander&quot; based on the software.

<text>Yucef Merhi (born February 8, 1977) is a Venezuelan artist, poet and computer programmer based in New York.

==Early life==
Yucef Merhi was born in Caracas, Venezuela. He studied at Universidad Central de Venezuela, New School University, and holds a Master&#x27;s in Interactive Telecommunications from New York University.

==Art career==
Merhi has produced a variety of works that engage electronic circuits, computers, video game systems, touch screens, and other devices in the presentation of his written words. One example is &quot;Poetic Clock&quot;, a machine that converts time into poetry, generating 86,400 different poems daily. The resulting artworks expand the limitations of language and the traditional context of poetry. His 2012 commissioned work for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, &quot;Quetzalcoatl 2.0.1.2.&quot;, was a web-based work that &quot;aims to reveal the voice of Quetzalcoatl in the technological reality of 2012 A.D.&quot;
