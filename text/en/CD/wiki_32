<text>Gwendolyn Lenna Torrence (born June 12, 1965) is a retired American sprinter and Olympic champion. She was born in Decatur, Georgia. She attended Columbia High School and the University of Georgia. She was offered a scholarship because of her athletic abilities, but she said she wasn&#x27;t interested because she initially wanted to become a beautician. From the persuasion from her coaches and family, she chose to enroll to the University of Georgia.

In the early 1990s, Gwen Torrence was one of the best sprinters in the world, winning five Olympic medals, and three gold.

Torrence won medals at the Summer Olympics, Outdoor &amp; Indoor World Championships, Pan American Games, Goodwill Games, and World University Games.
In 1988, Torrence achieved a tie with Evelyn Ashford in the 55 m race at the U.S. national indoor championships. She also had many battles both on the track and in the press with Florence Griffith Joyner.

In the 200 m at the 1995 World Championships, she was disqualified for stepping out of her lane after finishing first. This left her idol, Merlene Ottey, to be promoted to first place.

In 2000 she was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="882495" wikidata="Q2271966" url="?curid=882495" title="The Conference of the Birds">
<text>The Conference of the Birds or Speech of the Birds (, &quot;Manṭiq-uṭ-Ṭayr&quot;, also known as &quot;Maqāmāt-uṭ-Ṭuyūr&quot;; 1177) is a Persian poem by Sufi poet Farid ud-Din Attar, commonly known as Attar of Nishapur. The title is taken directly from the Qur’an, 27:16, where Sulayman (Solomon) and Dāwūd (David) are said to have been taught the language, or speech, of the birds (&quot;manṭiq al-ṭayr&quot;). Attar’s death, as with his life, is subject to speculation.

==Synopsis==
In the poem, the birds of the world gather to decide who is to be their sovereign, as they have none. The hoopoe, the wisest of them all, suggests that they should find the legendary Simorgh. The hoopoe leads the birds, each of whom represents a human fault which prevents humanity from attaining enlightenment.

The hoopoe tells the birds that they have to cross seven valleys in order to reach the abode of Simorgh. These valleys are as follows:

Sholeh Wolpé writes, &quot;When the birds hear the description of these valleys, they bow their heads in distress; some even die of fright right then and there. But despite their trepidations, they begin the great journey. On the way, many perish of thirst, heat or illness, while others fall prey to wild beasts, panic, and violence. Finally, only thirty birds make it to the abode of Simorgh. In the end, the birds learn that they themselves are the Simorgh; the name “Simorgh” in Persian means thirty (si) birds (morgh). They eventually come to understand that the majesty of that Beloved is like the sun that can be seen reflected in a mirror. Yet, whoever looks into that mirror will also behold his or her own image.&quot; 

==Commentary==
Attar&#x27;s use of symbolism is a key, driving component of the poem. This handling of symbolisms and allusions can be seen reflected in these lines:

Beside the symbolic use of the Simorgh, the allusion to China is also very significant. According to Idries Shah, China as used here, is not the geographical China, but the symbol of mystic experience, as inferred from the Hadith (declared weak by Ibn Adee, but still used symbolically by some Sufis): &quot;Seek knowledge; even as far as China&quot;. There are many more examples of such subtle symbols and allusions throughout the Mantiq.
Within the larger context of the story of the journey of the birds, Attar masterfully tells the reader many didactic short, sweet stories in captivating poetic style.

Sholeh Wolpé, in the foreword of her modern translation of this work writes:
Wolpé further writes: &quot;The book is meant to be not only instructive but also entertaining.&quot;

==&quot;La Conférence des oiseaux&quot; and other theatrical adaptations==
Peter Brook and Jean-Claude Carrière adapted the poem into a play titled &quot;La Conférence des oiseaux&quot; (&quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot;), which they published in 1979. Brook toured embryonic versions of the play around rural Africa during the visit of his International Centre for Theatre Research to that continent in 1972–73, before presenting two extremely successful productions to Western audiences—one in New York City at La MaMa E.T.C., and one in Paris. John Heilpern gives an account of the events surrounding the early development of the play in his 1977 book &quot;Conference of the Birds: The Story of Peter Brook in Africa&quot;.

Sholeh Wolpe&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot; was premiered by Inferno Theatre and Ubuntu Theater Project (now Oakland Theater Project), in Oakland California in November 2018.

==In popular culture==
ARTE France will launch &quot;30 Birds&quot;, an upcoming puzzle video game inspired by Persian art and &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot;. Set in the magical city of The Lanterns, the player takes on the role of Zig, a female detective assigned to track down an internationally wanted criminal known as &quot;The Scientist&quot;, who is also the prime suspect in the kidnapping of the city&#x27;s patron bird goddess, Simurgh. For Zig to both apprehend The Scientist and rescue Simurgh, she must recruit the eponymous thirty birds while solving complex puzzles along the way.

<doc id="882499" wikidata="Q274536" url="?curid=882499" title="Azerbaijan (Iran)">
<text>Azerbaijan or Azarbaijan (, , ), also known as Iranian Azerbaijan, is a historical region in northwestern Iran that borders Iraq and Turkey to the west and Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Azerbaijani exclave of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to the north.

Iranian Azerbaijan includes three northwestern Iranian provinces: West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Ardabil. Some authors also include Zanjan in this list, some in a geographical sense, others only culturally (due to the predominance of the Azeri Turkic population there). The region is mostly populated by Azerbaijanis, with minority populations of Kurds, Armenians, Tats, Talysh, Assyrians and Persians.

Iranian Azerbaijan is the land originally and historically called Azerbaijan; the Azerbaijani-populated Republic of Azerbaijan appropriated the name of the neighbouring Azerbaijani-populated region in Iran during the 20th century. Historic Azerbaijan was called &quot;Atropatene&quot; in antiquity and &quot;Aturpatakan&quot; (Adurbadagan) in the pre-Islamic Middle Ages. Some people refer to Iranian Azerbaijan as South (or Southern) Azerbaijan and the Republic of Azerbaijan as Northern Azerbaijan, although others believe that these terms are irredentist and politically motivated.

Following military defeats at the hands of the Russian Empire, Qajar Persia ceded all of its territories in the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia to Russia via the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813 and the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828. The territories south of the Aras River, which comprised the region historically known as Azerbaijan, became the new north-west frontier of the Persian Empire and later Iran. The territories north of the Aras River, which were not known by the name Azerbaijan at the time of their capture by Russia, were absorbed into the Russian Empire, renamed the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic during the country&#x27;s short-lived independence from 1918 to 1920, incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, and finally became the independent Republic of Azerbaijan when the Soviet Union dissolved.

==Etymology and usage==
The name Azerbaijan itself is derived from &quot;Atropates&quot;, the Persian Satrap (governor) of Medea in the Achaemenid Empire, who ruled a region found in modern Iranian Azerbaijan called &quot;Atropatene&quot;. Atropates&#x27;s name is believed to be derived from the Old Persian roots meaning &quot;protected by fire.&quot; The name is also mentioned in the Avestan Frawardin Yasht: &quot;âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide&quot; which translates literally to: &quot;We worship the Fravashi of the holy Atare-pata.&quot; According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;: &quot;In Middle Persian the name of the province was called Āturpātākān, older new-Persian Ādharbādhagān (آذربادگان/آذرآبادگان), Ādharbāyagān, at present Āzerbāydjān/Āzarbāydjān, Greek &quot;Atropatēnḗ&quot; (Ἀτροπατηνή), Byzantine Greek &quot;Adravigánon&quot; (᾿Αδραβιγάνων), Armenian &quot;Atrpatakan&quot; (Ատրպատական), Syriac &quot;Adhorbāyghān&quot;.&quot; The name Atropat in Middle Persian was transformed to Adharbad and is connected with Zoroastrianism. A famous Zoroastrian priest by the name Adarbad Mahraspandan is well known for his counsels. Azerbaijan, due to its numerous fire-temples has also been quoted in a variety of historic sources as being the birthplace of the prophet Zoroaster although modern scholars have not yet reached an agreement on the location of his birth.

In the early 19th century, Qajar Iran was forced to cede to Imperial Russia its Caucasian territories north of the Aras River (modern-day Dagestan, Georgia, Armenia, and the Republic of Azerbaijan), through the treaties of Gulistan (1813) and Turkmenchay (1828). Following the disintegration of the Russian Empire in 1917, as well as the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, in 1918, the leading Musavat government adopted the name &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which was proclaimed on May 27, 1918, for political reasons, even though the name of &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; had always been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. Thus, until 1918, when the Musavat regime decided to name the newly independent state Azerbaijan, this designation had been used exclusively to identify the Iranian province of Azerbaijan.

==History==

===Pre-Islamic period===
The oldest kingdom known in Iranian Azerbaijan is that of the Mannea who ruled a region south-east of Lake Urmia centered around modern Saqqez. The Manneans were a confederation of Iranian and non-Iranian groups. According to Professor Zadok:
The Mannaeans were conquered and absorbed by an Iranian people called Matieni, and the country was called Matiene, with Lake Urmia called Lake Matianus. Matiene was later conquered by the Medes and became a satrapy of the Median empire and then a sub-satrapy of the Median satrapy of the Persian Empire.

According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the Medes were an:

After Alexander the Great conquered Persia, he appointed (328 BC) as governor the Persian general Atropates, who eventually established an independent dynasty. The region, which came to be known as Atropatene or Media Atropatene (after Atropates), was much disputed. In the 2nd century BC, it was liberated from Seleucid domination by Mithradates I of Arsacid dynasty, and was later made a province of the Sassanid Empire of Ardashir I. Under the Sassanids, Azerbaijan was ruled by a &quot;marzubān&quot;, and, towards the end of the period, belonged to the family of Farrokh Hormizd.

Large parts of the region were conquered by the Kingdom of Armenia. Large parts of the region made up part of historical Armenia. The parts of historical Armenia within what is modern-day Azerbaijan comprise; Nor Shirakan, Vaspurakan, and Paytakaran. Vaspurakan, of which large parts were located in what is modern-day Iranian Azerbaijan is described as the cradle of Armenian civilization.

On 26 May 451 AD, a very important battle was fought that would prove immensely pivotal in Armenian history. On the Avarayr Plain, at what is modern-day Churs (modern-day West Azerbaijan Province), the Armenian Army under Vardan Mamikonian clashed with Sassanid Persia. Although the Persians were victorious on the battlefield itself, the battle proved to be a major strategic victory for Armenians, as Avarayr paved the way to the Nvarsak Treaty (484 AD), which affirmed Armenia&#x27;s right to practice Christianity freely.

Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, briefly held the region in the 7th century until peace was made with the Sassanids. After the Islamic Conquest of Iran, Arab invaders converted most of its people to Islam and made it part of the caliphate.

===Islamic period===
====Sasanian and early Islamic period====
During the Arab invasion of Iran, the Spahbed of Iran was Rostam Farrokhzad, the son of Farrukh Hormizd, who was the son of Vinduyih, the uncle of Khosrau I and brother of the Sasanian usurper Vistahm. Rustam himself was born in Azerbaijan and led the Sasanian army into battle. He is also mentioned in the Shahnameh.

The Sasanian army was defeated at the battle of al-Qādisiyyah and Rostam Farrokhzad, along with many other Sasanian veterans, was killed. In 642, Piruz Khosrow, one of the Sasanian survivors during the battle of al-Qādisiyyah, fought against the Muslims at Nahavand, which was a gateway to the provinces of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Caucasian Albania. The battle was fierce, but the Sasanian troops lost during the battle. This opened the gateway for the Muslims to enter Azerbaijan. The Muslims then invaded Azerbaijan and captured Isfandiyar, the son of Farrukhzad. Isfandiyar then promised, in return for his life, that he would agree to surrender his estates in Azerbaijan and aid the Muslims in defeating his brother, Bahram. Bahram was then defeated and sued for peace. A pact was drawn up according to which Azerbaijan was surrendered to Caliph Umar on usual terms of paying the annual Jizya.

Muslims settled in Azerbaijan as they did in many parts of Iran. According to the Iranian Azerbaijani historian Ahmad Kasravi, more Muslims settled in Azerbaijan compared to other provinces due to the province&#x27;s plentiful and fertile pastures. Local revolts against the Caliphate were common and the most famous of these revolts was the Persian Khurramite movement.

====Abbasids and Seljuks====

After the revolt of Babak Khorramdin, who was a Zoroastrian of neo-Mazdakite background, the Abbasid caliphate&#x27;s grip on Azerbaijan weakened, allowing native dynasties to rise in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was taken over by the Kurdish Daisam and the Sallarid Marzuban, the latter united it with Arran, Shirvan, and most of Eastern Armenia. After confrontations with the local Dailamite and Kurdish populations who had already established their own dynasties and emirates in different parts of Azerbaijan, the Seljuks dominated the region in the 11th and early 12th centuries, at which point the linguistic Turkification of the native Iranian populations began. In 1136, Azerbaijan fell to the Atabakan-e-Azerbaijan and Atabakan-e-Maragheh. It was later invaded by the Khwarizm Shah Jalal ad-din who held Azerbaijan until the advent of the Mongol invasions.

In the early years of the 13th century, large parts of Azerbaijan were conquered by the Kingdom of Georgia, at the time led by Tamar the Great. Under the command of the brothers Zakaria and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli, the Georgians conquered Ardabil and Tabriz in 1208, and Qazvin and Khoy in 1210.

====Mongols and Turkmens====
The Mongols under Hulagu Khan established their capital at Maragheh. The book &quot;Safina-yi Tabriz&quot; describes the general state of Tabriz during the Ilkhanid period. After being conquered by Timur in the 14th century, Tabriz became an important provincial capital of the Timurid empire. Later, Tabriz became the capital of the Kara Koyunlu empire.

====Safavid, Afshars and Qajars and loss of the adjacent Caucasian territories====
It was out of Ardabil (ancient Artavilla) that the Safavid dynasty arose to renew the state of Persia and establish Shi&#x27;ism as the official religion of Iran. Around the same time, the population of what is now Azerbaijan and Iran were converted to Shiism, and both nations remain the only nations in the world with a significantly Shia majority, with Iran having the largest Shia population by percentage, with the Republic of Azerbaijan having the second-largest Shia population by percentage.

After 1502, Azerbaijan became the chief bulwark and military base of the Safavids. It was the chief province from which the various Iranian empires would control their Caucasian provinces, all the way up to Dagestan in the early 19th century. In the meantime, between 1514 and 1603, the Ottomans sometimes occupied Tabriz and other parts of the province during their numerous wars with their Safavid ideological and political archrivals. The Safavid control was restored by Shah Abbas but during the Afghan invasion (1722–8) the Ottomans recaptured Azerbaijan and other western provinces of Iran, until Nader Shah expelled them. At the beginning of the reign of Karim Khan Zand, the Azad Khan Afghan unsuccessfully revolted in Azerbaijan and later the Dumbuli Kurds of Khoy and other tribal chiefs ruled various parts of the territory. Azad Khan was defeated however by Erekle II. With the advent of the Qajars, Azerbaijan became the traditional residence of the heirs-apparent. Even until then Azerbaijan remained the main area from where the high-ranked governors would control the various territories and Khanates of the Caucasus while the main power stayed in Tehran.

Though the first Qajar Iranian ruler, Agha Mohammad Khan, had reconquered the Caucasus and all of Iran in several swift campaigns, such as the harsh re-subjugation of Georgia in 1795, Iran would eventually irrevocably lose all of the Caucasus region to neighbouring Imperial Russia during the course of the 19th century, which had a crucial impact on the region of modern-day Iranian Azerbaijan. Shortly after the reconquest of Georgia, Agha Mohammad Shah was assassinated while preparing a second expedition in 1797 in Shusha. The reassertion of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi, which would mark the beginning of the end of the Iranian-ruled domains in the Caucasus, comprising modern-day Georgia, Armenia, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and Dagestan thanks to the 19th century Russo-Persian Wars.

Since the late 17th/early 18th century, the Russians were actively pursuing an expansionist policy towards its neighbouring empires to its south, namely the Ottoman Empire and the successive Iranian kingdoms. Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s death and the Russian troops entering the Iranian possession of Tbilisi in 1799, led directly to the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), the first of a number of Russo-Persian wars during the 19th century, and the most devastating and humiliating one. By the end of the war in 1813 and the resulting Treaty of Gulistan, Qajar Iran was forced to cede Georgia, most of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan, and Dagestan to Russia. The only Caucasian territories remaining in Iranian hands were what is now Armenia, the Nakhichevan Khanate, and the Talysh Khanate. The next war, the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), resulted in an even more humiliating defeat, with Iran being forced to cede the remaining Caucasian regions, as well as having Russian troops temporarily occupying Tabriz and Iranian Azerbaijan. As Iran was unwilling to allow the Russians to gain possession over its Caucasian territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus, the millennia-old ancient ties between Iran and the Caucasus region were only severed by the superior Russian force of Russia through these 19th-century wars.

The area to the north of the river Aras, which included the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan, eastern Georgia, Dagestan, and Armenia, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia during the 19th century.

Through the course of the 19th century Iran lost to Russia regions which had been part Iran for centuries. By the end of the 19th century, the border between Iran and Russia was set more southwards, at the Aras River, which is currently the border between Iran and Armenia – Azerbaijan.

Subsequently, the Russians were very influential in Northern Iran including Azerbaijan (as Northern Iran fell into Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence for decades). After 1905, the representatives of Azerbaijan were very active in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution as a result to this Russian influence.

====Contemporary age====

The Russian (Tsarist) army occupied Iranian Azerbaijan in 1909 and again in 1912–1914 and 1915–1918, followed by Ottoman forces in 1914–1915 and 1918–1919; Bolshevik forces occupied Iranian Azerbaijan and other parts of Iran in 1920–1921, and Soviet forces occupied Iranian Azerbaijan in 1941, creating a very short-lived autonomous, Soviet-supported state from November 1945 to November 1946, which was dissolved after the reunification of Iranian Azerbaijan with Iran in November of the same year. The period roughly from the last major Russo-Persian War up to this date is so-called the period of high Russian influences in Iran. All of Northern Iran, including Iranian Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Qazvin, and many other places all the way up to Isfahan fell into the Russian sphere of influence. Russian armies were stationed in many regions of Iranian Azerbaijan, Russian schools were founded, and many Russians settled in the region, but less than in Gilan and Mazandaran. Also, Azerbaijan saw the large influx of the so-called White émigrées who fled to Iran following the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. Iranian nationalism is partly the product of Azerbaijani intellectuals. Azerbaijani provinces have played a major in the cultural and economic life of Iran in both the Pahlavi era as well as the Iranian Constitutional and Islamic revolution.

Many poets that came from Azerbaijan wrote poetry in both Persian and Azerbaijani. Renowned poets in Azerbaijani language are Nasimi, Shah Ismail I (who was known with the pen-name “Khata&#x27;i”), Fuzuli, Nasimi, and Jahan Shah were probably born outside what is now Iranian Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani was the dominant language of the Turkish ruling dynasties of the area, such as Ak Koyunlu, Kara Koyunlu, and was later used in the Safavid court, until Isfahan became the capital, and by religious, military and state dignitaries. In the 16th century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of Ashik () poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of “Khaṭāʾī” () Shah Ismail I wrote about 1,400 verses in Azerbaijani, which were later published as his &quot;Divan&quot;. A unique literary style known as &quot;qoshma&quot; ( for &quot;improvisation&quot;) was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah Tahmasp and Tahmasp I. In the span of the 17th century, 18th and 19th century, Fizuli&#x27;s unique genres as well Ashik poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as Qovsi Tabrizi, Shah Abbas Sani, Khasta Qasim, Mirza Fatali Akhundov, Seyid Abulgasim Nabati, Ali Mojuz and others.

An influential piece of post-World War II Azerbaijani poetry, &quot;Heydar Babaya Salam&quot; (Greetings to Heydar Baba) was written by Azeri poet Mohammad Hossein Shahriar. This poem, published in Tabriz in 1954 and written in colloquial Azerbaijani, became popular among Iranians and the people of Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. In &quot;Heydar Babaya Salam&quot;, Shahriar expressed his identity as an Iranian attached to his homeland, language, and culture. Heydar Baba is a hill near Khoshknab, the native village of the poet.

<text>Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault (; born 5 March 1949) is a French businessman, investor and art collector. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of LVMH, the world&#x27;s largest luxury goods company. Arnault is one of the richest individuals in the world; , he has an estimated net worth of billion according to &quot;Forbes&quot; and billion according to the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;. 

Born in Roubaix, Arnault was raised in a devoutly Catholic household. He pursued Engineering at École polytechnique, graduating in 1971. He began his career in his father&#x27;s company, Ferret-Savinel, shifting its focus to real estate, which laid the groundwork for his future career in the luxury goods market.

Arnault&#x27;s entry into the luxury sector was marked by his strategic acquisition in 1984 of the financially-struggling textile and retail conglomerate Boussac Saint-Frères, which included the prestigious fashion house Christian Dior. His aggressive business strategies earned him the nickname &quot;The Terminator&quot;, as he revitalized Dior and sold off other assets for profit. In 1987, he played a key role in the creation of LVMH (an acronym for Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), a global luxury goods company, by merging Louis Vuitton with Moët Hennessy. Through a series of strategic acquisitions and investments, Arnault built LVMH into a leading company in the luxury industry, overseeing significant growth and expansion into various sectors, including fashion, jewelry, watches, and wine.

Arnault&#x27;s influence extends beyond LVMH, with investments in web companies and philanthropic endeavors, particularly in the arts. He has been involved in notable real estate and yacht ventures. His leadership has led to LVMH becoming the largest company by market capitalization in the eurozone. Despite controversies, including his attempt to become a Belgian citizen, Arnault&#x27;s business acumen has solidified his status as a key figure in the global luxury market.

== Early life and education ==
Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault was born on 5 March 1949 in Roubaix. His mother, pianist Marie-Josèphe Savinel, daughter of Étienne Savinel, had a &quot;fascination for Dior&quot;. His father, manufacturer Jean Léon Arnault, a graduate of École Centrale Paris, owned the civil engineering company Ferret-Savinel. Raised in a &quot;strict Catholic-Auvergne&quot; style by his devoutly Catholic grandmother, Arnault took classical piano lessons as a child and was educated at Catholic schools, the Lycée Maxence Van Der Meersch in Roubaix and the Lycée Faidherbe in Lille, which takes boarders and prepares them for the &quot;grandes écoles&quot;.

In 1971, he graduated from the École Polytechnique, France&#x27;s leading engineering school.

== Career==

In 1971, soon after his graduation, Arnault began work for his father&#x27;s company. Three years later, after he convinced his father to shift the focus of the company to real estate, Ferret-Savinel sold the industrial construction division and was renamed Ferinel. Following the acquisition of a textile company and relocation of its headquarters, the company renamed the real estate branch to the George V Group. The real estate assets were later sold to Compagnie Générale des Eaux (CGE), eventually becoming Nexity.

=== 1971–1987: Professional start ===
Arnault began his career in 1971, at Ferret-Savinel, and was its president from 1978 to 1984. In 1984, Arnault, then a young real estate developer, heard that the French government was set to choose someone to take over the Boussac Saint-Frères empire, a textile and retail conglomerate that owned Christian Dior.

With the help of Antoine Bernheim, a senior partner of Lazard Frères, Arnault acquired the Financière Agache, a luxury goods company. He became the CEO of Financière Agache and subsequently won the bidding war for Boussac Saint-Frères, buying the group for a ceremonial one franc and effectively taking control of Boussac Saint-Frères. After Arnault bought Boussac, he laid off 9,000 workers in two years, after which he acquired the nickname &quot;The Terminator&quot;. He sold nearly all of the company&#x27;s assets, keeping only the Christian Dior brand and Le Bon Marché department store. By 1987, the company was profitable again and booked earnings of $112 million on a revenue stream of $1.9 billion.

=== 1987–1989: Co-founding and acquisition of LVMH ===
 He worked with Alain Chevalier, CEO of Moët Hennessy, and Henry Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton, to form LVMH in 1987.

In July 1988, Arnault provided $1.6 billion to form a holding company with Guinness that held 24% of LVMH&#x27;s shares. In response to rumors that the Louis Vuitton group was buying LVMH&#x27;s stock to form a &quot;blocking minority&quot;, Arnault spent $600 million to buy 13.5% more of LVMH, making him LVMH&#x27;s largest shareholder. LVMH had been created on the premise that the conglomerate would be too large for a single hostile raider. However, the premise failed to take into account internal takeover attempts. The fault became too large to ignore when Arnault had a differing strategic vision from Henry Racamier, Louis Vuitton&#x27;s president.

In January 1989, he spent another $500 million to gain control of a total of 43.5% of LVMH&#x27;s shares and 35% of its voting rights, thus reaching the &quot;blocking minority&quot; that he needed to stop the dismantlement of the LVMH group. He then turned on Racamier, stripped him of his power, and ousted him from the board of directors. On 13 January 1989, he was unanimously elected chairman of the executive management board.

=== 1989–2001: LVMH&#x27;s initial expansion and growth ===
After assuming leadership, Arnault led the company through an ambitious development plan, transforming it into one of the largest luxury groups in the world, alongside Swiss luxury giant Richemont and French-based Kering. In eleven years, annual sales and profit rose by a factor of 5, and the market value of LVMH increased by a factor of 15. In July 1988, Arnault acquired Céline. That same year, he sponsored French fashion designer Christian Lacroix to advertise the company&#x27;s luxury clothing line. LVMH acquired Berluti and Kenzo in 1993, the same year Arnault bought out the French economic newspaper &quot;La Tribune&quot;. La Tribune never achieved the desired success, despite his 150 million euro investment, and he sold it in November 2007 to buy a different French economic newspaper, &quot;Les Échos&quot;, for €240 million.

In 1994, LVMH acquired the perfume firm Guerlain. In 1996, Arnault bought out Loewe, followed by Marc Jacobs and Sephora in 1997. Five more brands were also integrated into the group: Thomas Pink in 1999, Emilio Pucci in 2000, and Fendi, DKNY, and La Samaritaine in 2001.

In the 1990s, Arnault decided to develop a center in New York to manage LVMH&#x27;s presence in the United States. He chose Christian de Portzamparreke to supervise this project. The result was the LVMH Tower that opened in December 1999. That same year, Arnault turned his eyes to Gucci, an Italian leather goods company, which was run by Tom Ford and Domenico De Sole. He discreetly amassed a 5 percent stake in the company before being detected. Gucci responded hostilely and called it a &quot;creeping takeover&quot;. Arnault then upped his stake to 34.4 percent while insisting he wanted to be a supportive and unassertive stakeholder. De Sole proposed that in return for board representation, Arnault would stop increasing his stake in Gucci. However, Arnault rejected this proposal. De Sole discovered a loophole that allowed him to issue shares with only board approval, and for every share LVMH bought, he created more for his employees, thus diluting Arnault&#x27;s stake. The fight dragged on until a settlement in September 2001. After the legal ruling, LVMH sold its shares and walked away with $700 million in profit.

In 1998, with businessman Albert Frère, Arnault purchased Château Cheval Blanc in a personal capacity. LVMH acquired Arnault&#x27;s share in 2009 to add to the group&#x27;s other wine property Château d&#x27;Yquem.

From 1998 to 2001, Arnault invested in a variety of web companies such as Boo.com, Libertysurf, and Zebank through his holding Europatweb. Groupe Arnault also invested in Netflix in 1999.

=== 2001–present: Increasing success and profitability ===

In 2007, Blue Capital announced that Arnault owned jointly with the California property firm Colony Capital 10.69% of France&#x27;s largest supermarket retailer and the world&#x27;s second-largest food distributor Carrefour.

In 2008, he entered the yacht business and bought Princess Yachts for 253 million euros. He subsequently took control of Royal van Lent shipyard for an almost identical amount.

From 2010 until 2013, Arnault was a member of the Board of Advisors of the Malaysian 1MDB fund.

On 7 March 2011, Arnault announced the acquisition of 50.4% of family-owned shares of the Italian jeweler Bulgari, to make a tender offer for the rest, which was publicly owned. The transaction was worth $5.2 billion. In 2011, Arnault invested $641 million in establishing LCapitalAsia. On 7 March 2013, &quot;National Business Daily&quot; reported that mid-priced clothing brand QDA would open stores with the assistance of Arnault&#x27;s private equity firm LCapitalAsia and Chinese apparel company Xin Hee Co., Ltd. in Beijing. In February 2014, Arnault entered into a joint venture with the Italian fashion brand Marco De Vincenzo, taking a minority 45% stake in the firm. In 2016, LVMH sold DKNY to G-III Apparel Group. In April 2017, Arnault announced the acquisition of Christian Dior haute couture, leather, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ready-to-wear, and footwear lines, which integrated the entire Christian Dior brand within LVMH.

By January 2018, Arnault had led the company to record sales of €42.6 billion in 2017, 13% over the previous year, as all divisions turned in strong performances. That same year, the net profit increased by 29%. In November 2019, Arnault planned to acquire Tiffany &amp; Co. for approximately US$16.2 billion. The deal was expected to close by June 2020. LVMH then stated in September 2020 that the takeover would not proceed and that the deal was &quot;invalid&quot; because Tiffany handled the business during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, Tiffany filed suit against LVMH, asking the court to compel the purchase or to assess damages against the defendant; LVMH planned to counter-sue, alleging that mismanagement had invalidated the purchase agreement. In mid-September 2020, a reliable source told &quot; Forbes&quot; that the reason for Arnault&#x27;s decision to cancel the Tiffany purchase was purely financial: Tiffany was paying millions in dividends to shareholders despite a financial loss of US$32 million during the pandemic. Upon examination of financial records, Arnault discovered that some US$70 million had already been paid out by Tiffany, with an additional US$70 million scheduled to be paid in November 2020. LVMH filed a counterclaim against the court action commenced by Tiffany; a statement issued by LVMH blamed Tiffany&#x27;s mismanagement during the pandemic and claimed that it was &quot;burning cash and reporting losses&quot;. In late October 2020, Tiffany and LVMH agreed to the original takeover plan, though at a slightly reduced price of nearly $16 billion, a minor reduction of 2.6% from the aforementioned deal. The new deal reduced the amount paid per share by LVMH from the original price of $135 to $131.50. LVMH completed the purchase of Tiffany in January 2021.

Under Arnault&#x27;s leadership, LVMH has grown to become the largest company by market capitalization in the eurozone, with a record of 313 billion euros ($382 billion) as of May 2021. Arnault has promoted decisions toward decentralizing the group&#x27;s brands as a business strategy. As a result of these measures, brands under the LVMH umbrella such as Tiffany are still viewed as independent firms with their history.

Arnault has said that brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior are successful because &quot;they have these two aspects, which may be contradictory: They are timeless, [and] they are at the utmost level of modernity.&quot;

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
In 1973, Arnault married Anne Dewavrin. Together, they had two children, Delphine and Antoine. They separated in 1990. In 1991, he married Hélène Mercier, the Canadian-born concert pianist. They have three sons, Alexandre, Frédéric, and Jean. Arnault and Mercier live in Paris. Arnault has four grandchildren, two from his son Antoine and two from his daughter, Delphine.

All five children—Delphine, Antoine, Alexandre, Frédéric, and Jean—have official roles in brands controlled by Arnault, along with his niece Stephanie Watine Arnault. Alexandre is the EVP of Tiffany &amp; Co., Frédéric is the CEO of LVMH Watches, and Jean is the Director of Watchmaking Marketing and Development at Louis Vuitton. Since 2010, Arnault&#x27;s daughter Delphine has been with Xavier Niel, a French billionaire businessman active in the telecommunications and technology industry. Effective February 1, 2023, Delphine is the chief executive officer of the luxury brand Dior.

=== Wealth ===
In April 1999, Arnault was first considered to be the richest person in fashion, topping Zara&#x27;s Amancio Ortega. That same year, he set up Pilinvest (Pilinvest Participations and Pilinvest Investissements), a holding company based in Belgium. Through Pilinvest, Arnault has been holding an 81% stake in Agache (former Groupe Arnault), the holding company that owns 48% of LVMH and 63% of its voting rights. In 2008, he established Protectinvest, a private foundation in Belgium set up to safeguard the integrity of the LVMH group until 2023; the foundation locked up the Arnault children&#x27;s ability to sell shares in Pilinvest until 2023, by which time Arnault&#x27;s youngest child turned 25, an age deemed old enough to assume responsibility for LVMH. 

In December 2011, six months before Socialist François Hollande took office as President of France, he transferred a 31 percent stake in Groupe Arnault – at the time considered by the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; worth €6.5 billion – to Pilinvest.

In 2016, Arnault was paid €7.8 million as the CEO of the LVMH group. In July 2019, Arnault became the second-richest man in the world, with a net worth of $103 billion. Arnault briefly surpassed Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world in December 2019, and again for a short time in January 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Arnault saw his wealth shrink by $30 billion as sales of luxury goods plummeted.

On 5 August 2021, Arnault regained the status of the wealthiest man in the world, with his net worth climbing to $198.4 billion. This occurred as sales of LVMH&#x27;s luxury goods surged in China and other parts of Asia. He is listed as &quot;Bernard Arnault &amp; family&quot; on the Forbes Billionaires list. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the Bernard Arnault &amp; family fortune to be $158 billion in 2022, positioning him ahead of Bill Gates. In 2022, Arnault changed the legal structure of Agache from a Societas Europaea (SE) to a joint-stock partnership to ensure family control over LVMH in the long term.

Arnault and his family had an estimated peak net worth of billion in April 2023, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. This made him the richest person in the world at the time, surpassing Elon Musk. Musk would surpass Arnaut in June 2023 in net worth with $240 billion, as Arnault&#x27;s wealth dropped to $190 billion.

According to &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; Arnault was the wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of about US $218 billion in May 2024. By 14 June 2024, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Musk had regained first place, with Bezos in second place, and Arnault, with 
 billion, in third place.

=== Request for Belgian citizenship ===
In 2013, it was disclosed that Arnault planned to apply for Belgian citizenship and was considering moving to Belgium. In April 2013, Arnault said that he had been misquoted and that he never intended to leave France: &quot;I repeatedly said that I would stay as a resident in France and that I would continue to pay my taxes... Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request for Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to die.&quot;

On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion, at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes but he declined their requests, explaining &quot;the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive, as now it was set to be levied on firms rather than people, and only due to stay in place for two years.&quot;

=== Transport ===
Arnault owned the converted research vessel &quot;Amadeus&quot;, which was sold in late 2015. His current yacht &quot;Symphony&quot; was built in the Netherlands by Feadship.

In October 2022, Arnault stated that LVMH sold its private jet after a Twitter user began to track its flights and stated he began renting private aircraft for his personal and business flights instead. The aircraft was a Bombardier Global 7500 which was registered F-GVMA.

===Lifestyle===
Arnault plays tennis weekly, watches his weight, and works continually.

== Art collection ==
Arnault&#x27;s collection includes works by Picasso, Yves Klein, Henry Moore, and Andy Warhol. He was also instrumental in establishing LVMH as a significant patron of art in France. The LVMH Young Fashion Designer was created as an international competition open to students from fine arts schools. Every year, the winner is awarded a grant to support the creation of the designer&#x27;s label and a year of mentorship.

From 1999 to 2003, he owned Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, an art auction house, and bought out the first French auctioneer, Tajan. In 2006, Arnault started the building project of the Louis Vuitton Foundation. Dedicated to the creation and contemporary art, the building was designed by the architect Frank Gehry. The Foundation&#x27;s grand opening at the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation Paris was held on 20 October 2014.

== Political views ==
In the second round of the 2017 French presidential election, Arnault publicly supported Emmanuel Macron. Brigitte Macron was the French teacher of Arnault&#x27;s sons Frédéric and Jean when they were students at the Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague. In 2025, he attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump.

<text>Donald Edward Newhouse (born 1929) is an American businessman who owns Advance Publications. It was founded in 1922 by his father, Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr., and its properties include Condé Nast (publisher of such magazines as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;), dozens of newspapers across the U.S. (including &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, and &quot;The Oregonian&quot;), cable company Bright House Networks, and a controlling stake in Discovery Communications. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, he has an estimated net worth of $11 billion as of June 2024. He resides in New York City.

==Early life==
Newhouse&#x27;s father, Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr., was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and began the family media business. His mother, Mitzi Epstein, was an arts patron and philanthropist who grew up in an upper middle class family on the Upper West Side, the daughter of a silk tie importer. Newhouse was included on the Jerusalem Post&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s 50 richest Jews in 2010.

== Philanthropy ==
In January 2020, Newhouse donated $75 million to Syracuse University&#x27;s S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. The communications school is named after his father, Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.

It was announced in March 2021 that Newhouse and his wife Susan would launch a fund at the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) with a $20m donation, the largest donation in the charity&#x27;s history.

==Personal life==
Newhouse married Susan Marley in 1955, just after she had graduated from Wellesley College.

*Katherine Irene Newhouse - school teacher at the Town School in New York; married Dr. Joseph Patrick Mele in 1991.
*Michael Andrew Newhouse - assistant publisher of the Times of Trenton; member of Associated Press board of directors since 2017; married Elyse Sue Applebaum in 1988. Elyse&#x27;s brother, Scott Applebaum, is founder and CEO of Multispark, LLC. Elyse works as the president of global development at Advance&#x27;s magazine company Conde Nast International.
*Steven O. Newhouse (b. 1957) - editor of the Jersey Journal; married in 1993 to Gina Sanders, later publisher of Gourmet and Teen Vogue.

The couple&#x27;s primary residence was in New York City, but they often spent weekends on their farm in New Jersey. They remained married until her death in 2015 of primary progressive aphasia, a different variant of the same rare disorder (frontotemporal dementia) that afflicted his brother, Si Newhouse.

<doc id="882510" wikidata="Q262861" url="?curid=882510" title="Danny Blanchflower">
<text>Robert Dennis Blanchflower (10 February 1926 – 9 December 1993) was a Northern Ireland footballer, football manager and journalist who played for and captained Tottenham Hotspur, including during their double-winning season of 1960–61. He was twice Footballer of the Year and ranked as the greatest player in Spurs history by &quot;The Times&quot; in 2009. After a lengthy playing career, he retired at the age of 38. He became a respected football journalist and, later, a football manager.

Blanchflower said of football: &quot;The great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning. It is nothing of the kind. The game is about glory, it is about doing things in style and with a flourish, about going out and beating the lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.&quot;

==Early years and family==
Blanchflower was born on 10 February 1926 in the Bloomfield district of Belfast, the first of five children born to John and Selina Blanchflower. His mother had played as a centre-forward on a women&#x27;s football team. He was educated at Ravenscroft public elementary school and was awarded a scholarship to Belfast College of Technology.

He left early to become an apprentice electrician at Gallaher&#x27;s cigarette factory in Belfast. He also joined the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) and in 1943 lied about his age to join the RAF. As a trainee navigator he was sent on a course to St Andrews University (where he acquired a lifelong love of golf) and in the spring of 1945 was posted to Canada for further training. By 1946, aged 20, he was back in Belfast, back at Gallaher&#x27;s, and building a reputation as an outstanding footballer. While at St Andrews Blanchflower played for the University College Dundee football team which was coached by former Celtic, Dundee United and Scotland trainer Jack Qusklay.

His younger brother Jackie (1933–1998) was also a Northern Irish international footballer and played for Manchester United before his playing career was ended by injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster of February 1958.

==Playing career==

Blanchflower signed for Glentoran in 1946, before crossing the Irish Sea and signing for Barnsley for £6000 in 1949, at the age of 23. He transferred from Barnsley to Aston Villa for a fee of £15,000, making his debut in March 1951. He made 155 senior appearances for Villa (148 in the League), before being sold during the 1954–55 season.

In 1954 Blanchflower was bought by Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £30,000, and during his ten years at White Hart Lane he made 337 League appearances, and 382 total appearances (scoring 21 goals). The highlight of his time at Spurs came with the 1960–61 season. With Blanchflower as captain Spurs won their first 11 games, a record for the top flight of English football and eventually won the league by 8 points. They then beat Leicester City in the final of the FA Cup to become the first team in the 20th century to win the League and Cup double, not achieved since Aston Villa in 1897.

Blanchflower was voted FWA Footballer of the Year in 1958 and 1961. 

In 1962 he helped Spurs win the FA Cup, scoring a penalty in the final against Burnley. In 1963 he captained his side to victory over Atlético Madrid in the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

During his time with Spurs he also had a short spell with Toronto City, alongside fellow Football League players Stanley Matthews and Johnny Haynes.

Making his debut in 1949, he earned 56 caps for Northern Ireland, and in 1958 captained his country when they reached the quarter-finals of the FIFA World Cup. He was the first Northern Irishman to achieve a half century of caps when he played against Wales in 1962.

On 4 December 1957 he captained the Northern Ireland team against Italy in Belfast, in a bad tempered game that came to be known as the &quot;Battle of Belfast&quot;; Blanchflower attempted to keep the peace as the game turned nasty.

He finally announced his retirement as a player of 5 April 1964 at the age of 38, having played nearly 400 games in all competitions for Spurs and captained them to four major trophies.

In 1965, Blanchflower briefly came out of retirement to play for Durban City. Blanchflower played three times for the club in South Africa&#x27;s National Football League (NFL).

==Style of play==

Considered to be the brains of the great Tottenham team of the 60&#x27;s, Blanchflower played as a defensive midfielder at right half and was known particularly for his accurate passing, his ability to dictate the tempo of the game and his inspiring leadership.

==Career as manager==
Following his retirement as a player, Blanchflower coached at Spurs for a number of years, and double-winning manager Bill Nicholson intended for Blanchflower to be his long-term successor. When Nicholson resigned from the club in 1974 however, Blanchflower found himself being passed over in favour of Terry Neill, and subsequently left the club himself. He became manager of Northern Ireland for a brief spell in 1978, and was then appointed as Chelsea boss. However, he won only five of his 32 games in charge and he left them in September 1979.

==Off the field==

He was one of only a handful of players to have been awarded the title of FWA Footballer of the Year on two occasions, winning in both 1958 and 1961.
He was one of many signatories in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 July 1958 opposing &#x27;the policy of apartheid&#x27; in international sport and defending &#x27;the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games&#x27;. On 6 February 1961, he also became the first person to turn down the invitation to appear on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, simply walking away from host Eamonn Andrews. Contrary to belief, this incident was not broadcast live on air, but was being recorded to be shown at the beginning of the live transmission. &quot;I consider this programme to be an invasion of privacy&quot;, he explained. &quot;Nobody is going to press gang me into anything.&quot;

Blanchflower commentated on a match for ITV as early as 3 January 1956 – the final of the Southern Junior Floodlit Cup between West Ham and Chelsea. He also hosted editions of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Junior Sportsview&quot; in 1959 and ITV&#x27;s &quot;Junior Criss Cross Quiz&quot; in the mid 60s. He was the colour commentator for the CBS television network broadcasts of National Professional Soccer League (NASL) matches in the United States in 1967. His candour about the fledgling league&#x27;s shortcomings distressed network executives, as he recounted in a 10 June 1968 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article he authored. In the 1968–69 season he was the regular commentator for Yorkshire Television.

==Later life and death==
Anton Weinberg&#x27;s 1985 Channel 4 documentary film &quot;The Keller Instinct&quot; featured an appearance by Blanchflower, who spoke approvingly of his late friend musicologist Hans Keller&#x27;s advocacy of inventive, tactically creative football. He retired from his position as a writer for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; in 1988.

On 1 May 1990, Tottenham held a testimonial match for him at White Hart Lane, but by this stage he was in the first stages of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

He was eventually placed in Woodlands Nursing Home, Staines. He died there from pneumonia on 9 December 1993, aged 67. He was buried nearby at St. Jude&#x27;s Cemetery, Englefield Green.

==Legacy==
Blanchflower was honoured in his home city of Belfast with an Ulster History Circle plaque recognising his outstanding achievements in the world of sport. The blue plaque is located at 49 Grace Avenue, his childhood home.

The Danny Blanchflower Playing Fields in East Belfast, owned by Belfast City Council, was named after him. Plans to redevelop the site date to include more professional football facilities started in the mid-2000s and went through several revisions. By 2020, construction of a new stadium and grounds for Harland &amp; Wolff Welders F.C. was underway in the park, to be followed by nature trails and community projects.

<doc id="882513" wikidata="Q1451167" url="?curid=882513" title="François Pinault">
<text>François Pinault (born 21 August 1936) is a French billionaire businessman, founder of the luxury group Kering and the investment holding company Artémis.

Pinault started his business in the timber industry in the early 1960s. Taken public in 1988, his company invested in specialty store chains and changed its name to Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR). By the end of 1999, PPR shifted towards luxury and fashion. In 2003, he passed on the management of his companies to his elder son François-Henri to follow his passion for contemporary art.

In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Pinault&#x27;s net worth at $31.6 billion, ranking him as the 54th-richest person in the world.

==Early life==
François Pinault was born on 21 August 1936 in Les Champs-Géraux, a commune in the north of Brittany in the west of France. His father was a timber trader.

Pinault grew up in the rural French countryside, beginning his career working for his family&#x27;s timber business. He dropped out of school at the age of 16 from the College Saint-Martin in Rennes. In 1956, he enlisted in the military during the Algerian war. Afterwards, he returned to the family business, which he sold following his father&#x27;s death.

== Career ==
François Pinault started his first business in 1963 as a wood-trading company. Pinault SA grew strongly and diversified its portfolio by acquiring several companies facing bankruptcy, including Chapelle Darblay, to restructure them. On 25 October 1988, Pinault SA was taken public in the Paris stock exchange and started to invest in specialty store chains. He acquired a majority stake in CFAO (specialized distribution in Africa), Conforama (furnishing retailer), Printemps (department store), La Redoute (mail order), and Fnac (books and electronics retailer). Pinault SA was renamed Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) in 1993.

In 1992, Pinault set up the holding company Artémis to manage the Pinault family&#x27;s investments. Controlled 100% by Pinault and his family, Artémis controls the vineyards Château Latour (Bordeaux), Clos de Tart (Bourgogne), Domaine d&#x27;Eugénie (Vosne-Romanée), Château Grillet (Rhône Valley), Eisele Vineyard (Napa Valley), and the champagne Jacquesson. Artémis bought the news magazine &quot;Le Point&quot; in 1997, the auction house Christie&#x27;s in 1998, and the luxury cruise company Ponant in 2015. Pinault has been the owner of the Rennes football club since 1998. In September 2023, Artémis acquired 53% of Creative Artists Agency for $7 billion.

By the end of the 1990s, François Pinault started to shift his business focus from retail to luxury. In March 1999, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute purchased a controlling 42% stake of the Gucci Group for $3 billion, and bought the Yves Saint Laurent company. Pinault then purchased the French jewelry company Boucheron in 2000, Balenciaga in 2001, and the British fashion house Alexander McQueen. In May 2003, he handed over the management of his companies to his son François-Henri who pursued the consolidation of the luxury group with new acquisitions (Brioni, Girard-Perregaux, Pomellato...) and changed the group&#x27;s name to Kering in 2013.

== Art ==
Pinault bought his first significant painting, &quot;Cour de ferme&quot; by Paul Sérusier, in 1980. He collected art of the 20th century (Mondrian, Picasso, Man Ray, ...) before following contemporary artists (David Hammons, Rudolf Stingel, Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, Subodh Gupta, Paul McCarthy, Bruce Nauman, Donald Judd, Robert Ryman, ...). In 2023, his art collection contained approximately 10,000 works.

In 2005, François Pinault bought the company Palazzo Grassi SpA which operated the Palazzo Grassi in Venice. The Japanese architect Tadao Ando renovated the historical building which housed the first exhibition of Pinault Collection in 2006. One year later, the Venice city council awarded the tender of the Punta della Dogana, which had been abandoned for 30 years, to Pinault Collection, adding 5,000 m2 to the Palazzo Grassi space in Venice. Tadao Ando also restored this historical site, which reopened to the public in June 2009. In 2013, Pinault achieved the third chapter of his cultural project in Venice with the renovation and transformation of the Teatrino, an open-air theater in ruins. Designed once again by Tadao Ando, the new Teatrino holds a 225-seat auditorium.

In 2016, Pinault and the city of Paris announced their plan to turn the Bourse de commerce in the center of Paris (1st arrondissement) into a new, Pinault Collection-branded contemporary art museum. Tadao Ando was put in charge of transforming the historic building. The museum opened in May 2021.In 2014, François Pinault launched, through the Pinault Collection, an artist residency program in Lens (Northern France) which opened in 2015. In 2015, in memory of his friend the writer (and Picasso biographer) Pierre Daix who died in 2014, Pinault created the Pierre Daix Prize to reward an outstanding book on modern and contemporary art every year.

==Other commitments==

=== Environment ===
In 1990, following a fire in the Paimpont forest in Brittany, Pinault immediately financed the reforestation project. In 2000, he provided a significant financial assistance to help the islands in Brittany affected by the oil spill following the sinking of the &quot;Erika&quot;. In 2022, he pledged to contribute 500,000 euros to restore the chapel Saint-Michel of Brasparts in Monts d&#x27;Arrée, and the butte on which it stands on, after it had been ravaged by fire.

=== Historical buildings ===
In 2000, Pinault bought the Théâtre Marigny which was fully renovated from 2013 to 2018. In 2012, he bought the Villa Greystones in Dinard, France, designed by Michel Roux-Spitz (&quot;monument historique&quot; in 2019). In 2018, Pinault made a significant contribution to the restoration of Victor Hugo&#x27;s house, the Hauteville House, in Guernsey.

After the Notre Dame de Paris fire on 15 April 2019, the Pinault family pledged 100 million euros as a donation to the reconstruction works and repairs of the cathedral.

In 2021, he bought the hôtel particulier Hôtel de Cavoye in the 7th arrondissement of Paris for 80 million euros. He is also the owner of the château de la Mormaire (Yvelines), and of the Hôtel de Clermont-Tonnerre and the Hôtel Choiseul-Praslin (Paris). In 2022, he pledged to finance the restoration of the Chapelle Saint-Michel on top of the Monts d&#x27;Arrée that was deteriorated by a wildfire and bought the villa Bel-Esbat located a few hundred meters away from Villa Greystones in Dinard.
==Wealth==
As of September 2023, according to the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, Pinault&#x27;s wealth was estimated at US$39.1 billion, making him the 32nd-richest person in the world.

In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Pinault&#x27;s net worth at $31.6 billion, ranking him as the 54th-richest person in the world.

<text>The Citation Star was a Department of War personal valor decoration issued as a ribbon device which was first established by the United States Congress on July 9, 1918 (Bulletin No. 43, War Dept. 1918). When awarded, a silver star was placed on the suspension ribbon and service ribbon of the World War I Victory Medal to denote a Citation (certificate) for &quot;Gallantry In Action&quot; was awarded to a soldier, or to a marine or Navy corpsman attached to the Army&#x27;s Second Division (2nd Infantry Division), American Expeditionary Forces. The Citation Star was replaced in 1932 with the introduction of the Silver Star Medal.

==Authorization==
To receive a Citation Star, an individual had to be officially cited in orders by a General Order Number. The Citation Star is authorized retroactively to denote being cited for gallantry in action back to the American Civil War. General Henry Jervey, Office of the Chief of Staff, in a letter dated February 26, 1926, wrote:

The Secretary of War directs as follows - The following is the amended version of paragraph 187 of Army Regulation: &quot;No more than one Medal of Honor or one Distinguished Service Cross or one Distinguished Service Medal shall be issued to any one person, but for each succeeding or act sufficient to justify the award of a Medal of Honor or Distinguished Service Cross or Distinguished Service Medal, respectively, a bronze oak leaf cluster, shall be issued in lieu thereof; and &quot;for each citation of an officer or enlisted man for gallantry in action&quot;, published in orders from headquarters of a force commanded by a general officer, not warranting the issue of a Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross or Distinguished Service Medal, &quot;he shall wear a silver star, inch in diameter&quot;, as prescribed in Uniform Regulations.&quot;
Army Regulation 600-40 specified that the &quot;Citation Star&quot; would be worn above a campaign clasp on the suspension ribbon of the medal and to the wearer&#x27;s right of the bronze service stars on the service ribbon. Authorized Army Citation Stars may be worn on the following service medals:

*World War I Victory Medal
*Civil War Campaign Medal
*Indian Campaign Medal
*Spanish Campaign Medal
*Philippine Campaign Medal
*China Campaign Medal
*Mexican Service Medal

==Silver Star Medal==
On July 19, 1932, the United States Secretary of War approved the Silver Star Medal to replace the Citation Star ( inch 
&quot;Silver Star&quot;). The Silver Star Medal is a large gold hue gilt-bronze star which displays a &quot; Silver Star in the center of the medal hung from a red, white, and blue ribbon. Recipients of the Citation Star could exchange the award for the medal. In August 1932, Douglas MacArthur received the first Silver Star Medal, with one silver and one bronze oak leaf cluster converted from the seven Citation Stars he received for World War I.

An act of Congress authorized the Silver Star Medal for the Navy on 7 August and the Army on 16 December 1942 during World War II (retroactive to 7 December 1941). The Army referred to the award as the &quot;Silver Star&quot; and the Navy referred to the award as the &quot;Silver Star Medal&quot;. Additional awards from the Navy are denoted by gold and silver &quot; stars. The Department of Defense (DoD) refers to the decoration as the &quot;Silver Star Medal&quot; (SSM).

Also during World War II, a silver inch &quot;service star&quot; began being worn on certain medals in lieu of five bronze -inch service stars.

==Navy Commendation Star==
The Department of the Navy also authorized a inch &quot;silver star&quot; named the Navy Commendation Star (Navy Letter of Commendation Star) for those sailors and marines commended for performance of duty by the Secretary of the Navy which also was to be placed on the World War I Victory Medal for each citation. The Army and Navy inch Silver Stars were not considered equivalent awards, however, as the Navy Commendation Star could not be exchanged for the Silver Star Medal.

At the start of World War II, the Navy Commendation Star was declared obsolete and none were issued after 1941. In 1943, a Navy Commendation Ribbon was authorized. In the 1950s, the Department of the Navy began accepting applications from eligible World War I veterans who were authorized the Navy Commendation Star to be reissued the Navy Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant. In 1960 and 1994, this decoration was renamed the Navy Commendation Medal and Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal. Additional awards of this medal are also denoted by gold and silver &quot; stars.

<text>Johnny Mac Cassaday (; December 14, 1971 – September 9, 2024) was an American comic book artist, writer, and television director. He was best known for his work on the critically acclaimed &quot;Planetary&quot; with writer Warren Ellis, where his art style conveyed a sense of realism despite that book&#x27;s fantastical settings. His later works included &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; with Joss Whedon, &quot;Captain America&quot; with John Ney Rieber, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; with Jason Aaron. 

Both Marvel Comics and DC Comics include many of Cassaday&#x27;s iconic images in their marketing, and in their art and poster book collections. Marvel Comics-based animated films have made extensive use of his art. He received multiple Eagle and Eisner Awards and nominations for his work.

==Early life==
Johnny Mac Cassaday was born on December 14, 1971, in Fort Worth, Texas. A self-taught illustrator, Cassaday listed his influences as, among others, NC Wyeth, classic pulp magazine-culture iconography, and popular music. Cassaday studied film in school, calling it &quot;an equal passion to comics.&quot;

==Career==
===Comics===
Cassaday directed television news in Texas for five years before moving to New York. He spent one summer working a construction job while working on his portfolio in prepration for San Diego Comic-Con.

In 1994 Cassaday broke into the comic book industry with a one-page illustration and a short story for Boneyard Press. 

In 1996, at San Diego Comic-Con, Cassaday showed his portfolio to popular comic book writer and editor Mark Waid, who recommended him to writer Jeff Mariotte, with whom Cassaday would create the series &quot;Desperadoes&quot;, a Weird West series that was published from 1997 - 2002. Waid recalled, &quot;I refuse to take any real credit for &#x27;discovering&#x27; John Cassaday. I can&#x27;t take credit for having functioning eyeballs.&quot; Soon after, Cassaday began receiving job offers from bigger publishers. He quit his construction job and left Texas for New York.

In December 1996 he produced art for Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;Ghost&quot;. Within a year, he was hired to be the regular artist on Homage Comics&#x27; &quot;Desperadoes&quot;.

In late 1997 Cassaday was hired by DC and Marvel as artist on the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Flash&quot; annuals, &quot;X-Men/Alpha Flight&quot;, and &quot;Union Jack&quot;. His work on &quot;X-Men&quot; made him one of the title&#x27;s most popular artists.

In 1999, Cassaday and writer Warren Ellis created &quot;Planetary&quot; for WildStorm Productions. Relating the manner in which the episodic series would feature different settings in each issue, Ellis, recalled in 2024, &quot;John said he&#x27;d love to try a monthly series, but hated the idea of having to draw the same thing every issue.&quot; To this end, the stories revolved around concepts as diverse as Doc Savage analogues, an island of monsters reminiscent of Japanese kaiju films, the ghost of a murdered Chinese police officer, and a doppelgänger of Marilyn Monroe who was subjected to scientific experiments by the government. Cassaday&#x27;s covers for the series were designed like movie posters, with the book&#x27;s logo reimaginzed for each issue. He also modeled the character Drummer after himself.

Cassaday subsequently worked on other titles for various publishers, including &quot;Gen13&quot;, &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;, &quot;The Hulk&quot;, and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He worked on multiple Captain America projects, including an issue of &quot;Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America&quot; written by Jeph Loeb.

He based his cover art on World War II propaganda posters. Marvel released the covers in a series of poster art books. He has also created covers for comic books featuring &quot;The Phantom&quot;, for US publisher Moonstone Books and the European Egmont, as well as covers for Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Firefly&quot; spinoff comic &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Guy Ritchie&#x27;s Gamekeeper&quot;. He handled covers and art direction on Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; comic-book series. Books featuring his art include &quot;Wizard&#x27;s PosterMania!&quot;, &quot;Women of Marvel Poster Book&quot;, &quot;Wolverine Poster Book&quot;, &quot;New Avengers Poster Book&quot;, three editions of the &quot;Captain America Poster Book&quot;, and &quot;DC Comics Covergirls&quot;. In 1999, he provided black-and-white interior illustrations for the novel &quot;Gen13&quot;: &quot;Netherwar&quot;, by Christopher Golden and Jeff Mariotte, published by Ace Books.

From 2004 to 2008, Cassaday illustrated the graphic novel trilogy &quot;Je suis légion&quot; by Fabien Nury from Les Humanoïdes Associés. The English language edition was published as an eight issue comic series &quot;I Am Legion&quot; by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing. In July 2006, Humanoïdes announced a co-production deal with Pierre Spengler for a screen adaptation of the work. At the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, it was announced that the three picture series would be directed by Nacho Cerda with a screenplay by Richard Stanley.

Cassaday wrote stories for &quot;Hellboy: Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Little Nemo: Dream Another Dream&quot;, &quot;Rocketeer Adventures&quot;, &quot;X-Men: Alpha Flight&quot;, &quot;Bela Lugosi: Takes from the Grave&quot;, and &quot;Union Jack&quot;. He also wrote drawing instruction articles for &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Wizard: How to Draw&quot;.

John Cassaday appeared in the &quot;Captain America 75th Anniversary&quot; television special on ABC in January 2016. That same year he provided the art on the &quot;Captain America&quot; special anniversary issue. and re-teamed with Joss Whedon on a story featuring Sam Wilson in &quot;Captain America: Sam Wilson&quot; #7.

Cassaday headlined the highly successful 2015 &quot;Star Wars&quot; revival at Marvel Comics. The book became the #1 selling comic for 2015. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, it was the top-selling comic of the last 20 years, having sold approximately one million copies.

===Film and television===
====Work====
Cassaday&#x27;s art appeared in an episode of &quot;HBO First Look&quot;, a 2003 documentary about the making of the &quot;Daredevil&quot; film. 

He worked as a concept artist on the film adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; classic graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

In 2009, the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; animated DVD series was adapted as a motion comic from Cassaday&#x27;s art for the comic book series written by Joss Whedon.

Cassaday directed &quot;The Attic&quot;, the December 18, 2009 episode of the television series &quot;Dollhouse&quot;, which aired as the tenth episode of that series&#x27; second season. 

Cassaday&#x27;s art was used extensively in the Futureal Studio documentary &quot;Adventures into Digital Comics&quot; (2010).

====Onscreen appearances====
Cassaday himself appeared in a Wizard World-sponsored documentary in 2002. He also appeared in &quot;Generation X: The Comic Book History of the X-Men&quot;, a 2006 DVD documentary about the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise.

As an actor, Cassaday appeared in small roles in the 2012 horror film &quot;House on the Hill&quot; and &quot;ITV Playhouse&quot;.

==Technique and materials==
In addition to penciling and inking his interior comics pages, Cassaday did his cover work in ink and charcoal, working with frequent collaborator Laura Martin, who digitally colored most of his covers. He credited the challenges of working on complicated books like &quot;Planetary&quot; with making him a better artist.

==Personal life and death==
Cassaday&#x27;s partner was Tara A. Martinez.

Cassaday died from cardiac arrest in a Manhattan hospital on September 9, 2024, at the age of 52. He was survived by his mother and a sister, Robin Cassaday, his father having died of cancer in 1990.

<text>Ruled paper (or lined paper) is writing paper printed with lines as a guide for handwriting. The lines often are printed with fine width and in light colour and such paper is sometimes called &quot;feint-ruled paper&quot;. Additional vertical lines may provide margins, act as tab stops or create a grid for plotting data; for example, graph paper (&quot;squared paper&quot; or &quot;grid paper&quot;) is divided into squares by horizontal and vertical lines.

== History ==
Initially, paper was ruled by hand, sometimes using templates. Scribes could rule their paper using a &quot;hard point,&quot; a sharp implement which left embossed lines on the paper without any ink or color, or could use &quot;metal point,&quot; an implement which left colored marks on the paper, much like a graphite pencil, though various other metals were used.

On 15 June 1770, English inventor John Tetlow patented a &quot;machine for ruling paper for music and other purposes.&quot; A later machine was invented by William Orville Hickok in the mid-19th century.

==Generic types==
Lines on ruled paper provide a guide to help users keep their writing or drawing consistent with a predetermined set of rules. The ruling layout is not determined by the paper size but by the purpose, style of handwriting or the language used. Many different line layouts support handwriting, calligraphy, plotting data on graphs, musical notation or help teach students to write in a particular language or script. The following are common examples:

* Note paper (or &quot;Writing paper&quot;, &quot;Filler paper&quot;, &quot;Loose leaf paper&quot;, &quot;Binder paper&quot;) is typically used for handwriting and is produced in different layouts and sizes. The layout usually consists of evenly spaced horizontal lines, or &quot;feints&quot;, with vertical lines drawn to indicate margins, the middle of the page, or sections of a line.
* Graph paper has horizontal and vertical lines evenly spaced over the entire page to create a grid of squares and is used for drafting, drawing and plotting graphs. Often every tenth or fifth line is bolded to assist in counting the lines when plotting data.
* Quadrille ruled paper (or &quot;quad paper&quot;) is similar to graph paper but without the bolded tenth lines. It is useful in mathematics to keep numbers in columns when doing manual operations such as long division or long multiplication, and in spreadsheets or accounts.
* Semi-log ruled paper is similar to quadrille ruled, except the horizontal lines are spaced according to the logarithmic scale instead of being evenly spaced.
* Log-log ruled paper is similar to semi-log ruled except that both the horizontal and vertical lines are spaced logarithmically.
* Manuscript paper is used for handwriting music. The most basic page is laid out with a series of five-line staves, each spanning the width of the page. Any musical notation (clefs, bars, notes, etc.) may be written in as desired by the artist. As notebook paper is to the written word, music manuscript paper is to the written score.

==Regional standards==

Regional standards exist for ruling layouts, particularly for academic or government clerical purposes.

===China===

Elementary students use () Tianzige ruled paper, featuring boxes for individual characters. Sometimes each box is subdivided (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) as reference to aid the writer with the relative proportion and placement of character components.

In Taiwan, the Japanese genkō yōshi is the main form of rule used by students writing in Mandarin, where it is called (). Students use the thin vertical column to transcribe Bopomofo pronunciation.

===France===
In order to foster handwriting discipline, a type of ruling known as &quot;Seyès ruling&quot; is used on paper in schools. Heavy vertical lines are spaced apart, beginning from the left-hand edge of the page. Three lighter lines are spaced apart between each pair of heavy lines. These sheets of paper are generally known as (large tiles) as opposed to the (small tiles) which are 5 × 5mm. Seyès ruled paper is available in single sheets () or joined double sheets (), which can be preferred for exams, being easier to handle (a single sheet can be lost, they might be used as a portfolio to store more sheets, etc). Seyès ruled paper is available in A4 size () and in the very school specific 170 × 220 mm format ().

===Germany===
DIN 16552:1977-04 (&quot;Lines for handwriting&quot;) specifies the types of ruled paper to be used by school pupils.

===India===
Ruled paper exercise notebooks is available in a variety of semi-standardized formats:
* Double ruled paper commonly two rules in 15 mm spacing
* Four ruled paper similar to Handwriting Paper
* Single ruled paper commonly 8 mm
* Squared maths paper a 5 mm square grid

===Japan===
Among others, genkō yōshi (, &quot;manuscript paper&quot;) is a kind of paper mainly used for kanji script writing, formed vertically with individual boxes for each Chinese character. There is a thin column to the right of the boxes, for transcribing &quot;kana&quot; pronunciation. The sizes can vary for ability levels. It is used across the East Asian cultural sphere, for example in Korea for writing proverbs.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand standard for school stationery, 1984 specifies standards for ruled and unruled paper.

===Russia===
Formats for exercise notebooks are standardised. School exercise books must use 8 mm spacing between the lines. Other ruled paper may use 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm and 9 mm spacing. The paper for cursive writing uses pairs of lines 4 mm apart, with 8 mm between the pairs. They may also have angled lines at 65 degrees to vertical to provide additional guidance. The lines can have gray, blue, green or purple color. The vertical margin line must have red or orange color.

===South Africa===
A4 Ruled/Ledger Paper: 8 mm line height; 2 cm left margin. Top and bottom margins may vary. Often sold as &quot;college exercise books&quot; or &quot;exam pads&quot;.

===United States===
Ruled paper is available in a variety of semi-standardized formats:
* Gregg ruled paper has ruling specialized for stenography. &quot;Paper should be smooth and lined, dull in finish, with three lines to the inch and a line down the center.&quot;
* Junior legal ruled paper is found on 5-by-8-inch junior legal pads. This can be equal to narrow or medium rule, depending on the manufacturer.
* Manuscript ruled paper is used to teach young children how to write. A blank sheet consists of rows of three lines (the space between them depends on the age group being taught) with the middle line in each three-line set being dotted. The D&#x27;Nealian writing style is a well-known teaching method that makes use of this type of paper ruling. Another educational institution, A Beka Book, utilizes this ruling along with a house metaphor (upstairs, downstairs, and basement) to help young children learn where parts of each letter should be written. The usage is similar in concept to the use of the horizontal lines on French Seyès rule paper.
* Medium ruled (or college ruled) paper has spacing between horizontal lines, with a vertical margin drawn about from the left-hand edge of the page. Its use is very common in the United States.
* Narrow ruled paper has  in () spacing between ruling lines, and is used by those with smaller handwriting or to fit more lines per page.
* Pitman ruled paper has ruling specialized for stenography. It has spacing between ruling lines, with a single margin drawn down the center of the page.
* Wide ruled (or legal ruled) paper has spacing between horizontal lines, with a vertical margin drawn about from the left-hand edge of the page. It is commonly used by American children in grade school, as well as by those with larger handwriting.

===United Kingdom===
There appears to be no British Standard. However, the line spacing for adult ruled paper is most commonly 8 mm and squared maths paper has a 5 mm grid.
&lt;br&gt;
There is specialist handwriting paper available for primary schools (&quot;Education standard Learn to Write Exercise books&quot;) and a British Standard BS4448 (&quot;Specification for school exercise books and papers&quot;). You can find ruled paper at 15 mm spacing and squared maths paper at 10 mm spacing.
&lt;br&gt;
Anything above primary school tends to use adult ruling.

<text>VOCM is an AM radio station in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, broadcasting at 590 kHz. Owned by Stingray Group, VOCM first went on the air on October 19, 1936. Through the &quot;VOCM/Big Land FM Radio Network&quot; of stations owned by Stingray, VOCM programming is carried throughout the province.

VOCM and its sister station VOCM-FM are among the four radio stations in Canada having call signs beginning with the prefix VO, the ITU prefix issued to the Dominion of Newfoundland before its confederation into Canada in 1949. The other two, VOWR and VOAR-FM, also broadcast in St. John&#x27;s; all but VOCM-FM predate the confederation. VOCM-FM adopted the callsign in 1982 because of its corporate association with VOCM; all three of the others signed on before 1949, while Newfoundland was still a dominion, and were allowed to keep the &quot;VO&quot; call signs despite the end of Newfoundland&#x27;s sovereignty. During the time when the United States had bases in Newfoundland and Labrador, the American Forces Radio and Television Service operated radio station with the &quot;VO&quot; call signs including the last - VOUS in Argentia, which closed in the late 1960s. The rest of Canada&#x27;s radio stations use call signs of CB (for the CBC), CF, CH, CI, CJ and CK. VOCM 590 kHz is frequently audible in Western Europe after nightfall, usually ahead of other long distance North American AM station reception.

Stingray also owns a number of other AM stations in Newfoundland and Labrador that use VOCM as their main or secondary brand. These stations all have C callsigns.

==History==

VOCM was started by Walter Banks Williams III, and his father in the family home at 80 Circular Road in St. John&#x27;s. Williams was very interested in radio, and had attended training at the RCA and the Radio Training Schools in the United States.

On December 22, 1933, Williams (through his company, Atlantic Broadcasting Co.) was issued a licence by the Newfoundland Post and Telegraph Department to operate a station from the second floor of the aforementioned family home. With the transmitter and other equipment built by Williams, VOCM began operations as an experimental father-son station operating only a few hours a day. The station&#x27;s antenna was built in the backyard and the technical equipment was placed in a backroom on the main floor. VOCM had truly been a family affair for some time; Walter&#x27;s son, Walter David Williams, later joined him in working long hours at the radio station for many years.

Later in 1937, Joseph Butler joined Williams as a partner in VOCM radio, through Colonial Broadcasting System Ltd. In 1954, Butler died in a plane accident, and in 1958 Joseph Butler Jr. acquired control of the company. Williams continued to work with the company until 1972, two years before his death in 1974.

In 1982, Colonial Broadcasting System changed its name to VOCM Radio Newfoundland Ltd. By this time the company had established a network of stations throughout eastern and central Newfoundland, as well as a sister FM station, VOCM-FM.

In May 2000, the assets of VOCM Radio were acquired by Harry Steele&#x27;s company Newfoundland Capital Corporation, which operated the stations as part of the Steele Communications division of Newcap Radio.

As of September 2016, VOCM network stations CHCM in Marystown and CKVO in Clarenville went off the air and now simulcast VOCM full-time.

As of March 9, 2022, VOCM network stations CFCB in Corner Brook and CKGA in Gander began simulcasting VOCM full-time.

==Programming==
===Talk shows===
VOCM programming includes talk shows such as &quot;Open Line&quot; with Paddy Daly, and &quot;On Target&quot; with Linda Swain, where Newfoundland and Labrador-related issues are discussed with callers and emails/tweets sent to the station are read and discussed. These programs are well-known and often perform highly in the radio ratings province-wide, these shows are generally considered to be non-partisan and are not driven by the hosts&#x27; personalities, unlike the majority of contemporary North American talk radio programs.

During the late 1990s, the VOCM network experimented with syndicated talk programming in the form of the Dr. Laura Schlessinger show, which aired on tape delay in the early evening. As with most Canadian stations airing the program, it was quietly dropped shortly after a Canadian Broadcast Standards Council ruling admonishing the host for making comments the CBSC claimed were discriminatory. While VOCM continues to air some short syndicated features and occasionally brokered programming (i.e. infomercials) on Sunday mornings, it does not regularly air other extended-length syndicated programming.

====Recent Years====
On December 1, 2016, VOCM expanded its talk programming to include syndicated programs such as &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; as well as shows that feature experts in the fields of finance, real estate and renewable energy sources. In addition, Tim Powers had his own show on VOCM that aired Fridays at 6:00 p.m. with a repeat at 2:00 on Sunday afternoons. Unlike &quot;Open Line&quot;, &quot;BackTalk&quot; or &quot;NightLine&quot;, Tim interviewed various individuals to go beyond the headlines. &quot;Conversations&quot; with John Moore. This show featured the CFRB personality interviewing celebrities, authors, athletes and others from a wide range of subject areas.

As time progressed, the expansion of talk radio was met with negative feedback from its listeners, even taking to social media and expressing their anger over the change (including the lack of music). Therefore, since August 21, 2017, VOCM has reverted to its Full Service format, reincorporating music in its programming.

===Sports===
VOCM&#x27;s play-by-play sports coverage is currently limited to the Royal St. John&#x27;s Regatta every August, and in some cases the Herder Memorial Trophy championship games. The VOCM network had carried the games of the American Hockey League&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs throughout the 1990s; however, coverage was dropped around the start of the 2000s, since the team&#x27;s fortunes were declining somewhat, and coverage interfered with the station&#x27;s more successful talk programming.

VOCM does not typically broadcast play-by-play coverage of out-of-market sports events, unlike most other full-service or news-talk stations in medium-sized Canadian markets, again since it would interfere with live talk programming.

===Music===
Outside of its talk programming, VOCM previously used a current country format, having adopted that format in mid-2002 shortly after sister station CKIX-FM dropped country music. Before that, the St. John&#x27;s station had aired a mix of soft adult contemporary and classic hits, veering more towards the latter since CJYQ&#x27;s flip to Newfoundland music in 2000; however, most VOCM network stations had carried a country format since at least the early 1990s.

VOCM is noteworthy for switching to an all-Christmas music format every year running until the playing of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; at New Years Eve. The Christmas music typically starts on the day of the yearly Dial-a-Carol event in late November. Dial-a-Carol is an annual fundraising effort by VOCM&#x27;s charity, the VOCM Cares Foundation, where listeners call in to make pledges and request their favourite Christmas songs be played. It is often commented on-air how overwhelming the requests are for Jim Reeves&#x27; &quot;Old Christmas Card&quot;, sometimes having to play it multiple times per hour.

On April 14, 2015 at 10:00p.m., VOCM, without notice, shifted its country format over to CJYQ and returned to its pre-2002 format of soft AC and classic hits, playing soft to medium tempo hits focusing on popular music from the 1970s to the mid-80s. Examples of artists featured under the new format include Glass Tiger, Billy Joel, The Human League, Foreigner, Berlin and Bob Seger.

Other specific programs include: Your VOCM Mornings, which carries a variety of information features (such as school information); the &quot;Saturday Night Cabin Party with Brian O&#x27;Connell&quot;, which is devoted to classic country music from the 1960s to the 1990s; and the &quot;VOCM Saturday Morning Irish Newfoundland Show with Greg Smith&quot;, playing Newfoundland music.

<doc id="882532" wikidata="Q2538485" url="?curid=882532" title="Alex (A Clockwork Orange)">
<text>Alex is a fictional character and the protagonist in Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film adaptation of the same name, in which he is played by Malcolm McDowell. In the book, Alex&#x27;s surname is not stated. In the film, however, Kubrick chose it to be DeLarge, a reference to Alex calling himself The Large in the novel. Later on in the film, two newspaper articles print his name as &quot;Alex Burgess&quot;, a reference to Anthony Burgess. In addition to the book and film, Alex was portrayed by Vanessa Claire Smith in the ARK Theatre Company&#x27;s multimedia adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, directed by Brad Mays.

==Character overview==
Alex is the narrator in the novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The character is portrayed as a thrill-seeking sociopath who robs, rapes, and assaults innocent people for his own amusement. Intellectually, he knows that such behaviour is morally wrong, saying that &quot;you can&#x27;t have a society with everybody behaving in my manner of the night&quot;. He nevertheless professes to be puzzled by the motivations of those who wish to reform him and others like him, saying that he would never interfere with their desire to be good; he simply &quot;goes to the other shop&quot;.

Alex dresses in the &quot;height of fashion&quot;, which consists of a waistcoat jacket with big shoulders and no lapels, a frilly off-white cravat as neck-wear, tight black pants with a spider symbol on the crotch and a codpiece underneath, and big boots. He speaks Nadsat, a teenage slang created by author Anthony Burgess. The language is based on largely English and Russian words, but also borrows from other sources such as Cockney rhyming slang, Romani speech, and schoolboy colloquialisms. His beverage of choice is milk spiked with various drugs, which he and his fellow gang members (&quot;droogs&quot;) drink to fortify themselves for &quot;ultraviolence&quot;. Alex is very fond of classical music, particularly Ludwig van Beethoven, whom he habitually refers to as &quot;Ludwig Van&quot;. While listening to this music, he fantasises about endless rampages of rape, torture and slaughter. Alex&#x27;s favourite melee weapon is a &quot;cut-throat britva&quot;, or straight razor.

==Character biography==
Alex lives with his parents in a block of flats in a dystopian England in which his brand of &quot;ultraviolence&quot; is common. At the age of 15, he is already a veteran of state reform institutions; in the film, he is somewhat older. He spends his days skipping school and listening to music, and his nights terrorizing the neighborhood with his &quot;droogs&quot; Georgie, Pete, and Dim. While the youngest of his gang, he is the most intelligent, and designates himself as the leader. Georgie resents his high-handedness, and begins plotting against him along with the rest of the gang. One night, the gang breaks into a woman&#x27;s house, and Alex assaults and kills her by ramming her face with a sculpture of a penis and testicles (in the book it is a bust of Beethoven). As Alex flees from the house after hearing police sirens, Dim hits him with a milk bottle (his chain in the book) and the gang leaves him to be arrested. Alex is found guilty of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Over the next two years, Alex is a model prisoner, endearing himself to the prison chaplain by studying the Bible. He is especially fond of the passages in the Old Testament portraying torture and murder. Eventually, prison officials recommend him for the Ludovico Technique, an experimental forced re-education treatment designed to eliminate criminal impulses. During the treatment, prison doctors inject him with nausea-inducing drugs and make him watch films portraying murder, torture and rape. The treatment conditions him to associate violent thoughts and feelings with sickness. Alex is particularly affected by watching footage of Nazi war crimes set to Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, one of his favourite pieces of music; as a result, he can no longer hear it without feeling sick.

His sentence is commuted to time served, and he is released. Once he returns to society, however, he finds that the treatment worked too well: any thought of violence brings him to his knees with pain, and he cannot defend himself. His parents have rented out his room, he is brutalised by his former victims, and beaten by Georgie (Billy Boy in the novel) and Dim, who are now police officers.

He collapses in front of an old house, owned by a writer the government considers &quot;subversive&quot;. The writer is one of the gang&#x27;s victims, but he does not recognise Alex, who had been wearing a mask as he and his friends beat the man and gang-raped his wife, who later died of pneumonia the writer believes was exacerbated by her ordeal. When Alex tells him of his plight, the writer promises to help him. However, the writer realises who Alex is upon hearing him singing &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, the very song he had sung while raping his wife (in the book, he recognizes Alex&#x27;s voice and speech patterns). He drugs Alex and forces him to listen to the Ninth Symphony, which causes Alex so much pain that he attempts suicide by jumping out of the window.

He survives, but is badly injured, and wakes up in a state hospital. His parents take him back and the government, smarting from the bad publicity, gives him a well-paying job where he can channel his naturally-violent tendencies against the enemies of the state. The effects of the Ludovico Technique have worn off, and Alex is his old, ultraviolent self again: &quot;I was cured, all right&quot;.

While the film ends here, the novel features an additional chapter in which Alex, now a few years older, has outgrown his sociopathy. While his new &quot;droogs&quot; commit crime sprees, Alex sits them out, as he has lost interest in violence. When he runs into Pete at a coffee shop and learns he got married, Alex begins to think about starting a family, but worries that his children will inherit his violent tendencies.

==Reception==
The American Film Institute rated Alex the 12th-greatest film villain of all time. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected Alex as the 42nd-greatest movie character of all time, and &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine rated Alex the 36th-greatest villain of all time. Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s performance has been widely acclaimed by critics. McDowell was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and some consider his failure to receive a Best Actor nomination at the Academy Awards a major snub. In 2008, his performance was ranked #100 on &quot;Premier&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time.&quot;

In 2004, Vanessa Claire Smith won &quot;LA Weekly&quot;″s Leading Female Performance award for her gender-bending performance in the stage production of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

<text>Aaron Augustus Sargent (September 28, 1827 – August 14, 1887) was an American journalist, lawyer, politician and diplomat. In 1878, Sargent historically introduced what would later become the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, giving women the right to vote. He was sometimes called the &quot;Senator for the Southern Pacific Railroad&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, he attended the common schools and then was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. In his youth, he worked as a printer in Philadelphia and then, in 1847, moved to Washington, D.C., where he was a secretary to a Congressman.

== Career ==
He moved to California in 1849 and settled in Nevada City in 1850. There he was on the staff of the &quot;Nevada Daily Journal&quot;, eventually becoming that newspaper&#x27;s owner. He was admitted to the California bar in 1854 and began practicing in Nevada City, becoming district attorney for Nevada County in 1856. He served in the California State Senate in 1856, and was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Senate in 1857.

=== Congress ===
Sargent was elected as a Republican to the 37th Congress; skipped several terms and was reelected to the 41st and 42nd Congresses. In 1861 he was the author of the first Pacific Railroad Act that was passed in Congress.

He was elected to the United States Senate in 1871 and served from 1873 to 1879. During his time in the Senate, he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Mines and Mining during the 44th Congress and chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Naval Affairs during the 45th Congress.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
In January 1878, Senator Sargent introduced the 29 words that would later become the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, allowing women the right to vote. Sargent&#x27;s wife, Ellen Clark Sargent, was a leading voting rights advocate and a friend of such suffrage leaders as Susan B. Anthony. The bill calling for the amendment would be introduced unsuccessfully each year for the next forty years.

=== Ambassador to Germany ===
Sargent returned to California in 1880. After leaving the Senate he practiced law in San Francisco for three years, leaving to become United States Ambassador to Germany for two years, and held office until German authorities excluded American pork from the German Empire which made his position personally distasteful. He turned down the appointment of Ambassador to Russia after William H. Hunt&#x27;s death and made an unsuccessful attempt for the Republican nomination for the Senate in 1885.

== Death and legacy ==
He died in San Francisco in 1887. His original interment at Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco, which closed by 1941. According to Sargent&#x27;s descendants, A.A. Sargent&#x27;s ashes were spread over the placer mine he had in Nevada City and a monument to him may be found in the old Pioneer Cemetery in Nevada City.

Sargent was a noted proponent of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, arguing in &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; in support of exclusion and for the renewal of the 1882 Exclusion Act after its expiration in 1892. The Chinese Exclusion Act was eventually renewed in 1892, and again—indefinitely—in 1902, staying in effect until 1943.

<doc id="882534" wikidata="Q3626147" url="?curid=882534" title="City rights in the Low Countries">
<text>City rights are a feature of the medieval history of the Low Countries, and, more generally, the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. A liege lord, usually a count, duke or similar member of the high nobility, granted to a town or village he owned certain town privileges that places without city rights did not have.

In Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, a town, often proudly, calls itself a city if it obtained a complete package of city rights at some point in its history. Its current population is not relevant, so there are some very small cities. The smallest is Staverden in the Netherlands, with 40 inhabitants. In Belgium, Durbuy is the smallest city, whilst the smallest in Luxembourg is Vianden.

==Overview==

When forced by financial problems, feudal landlords offered for sale privileges to settlements from around 1000. The total package of these comprises town privileges.

Such sales raised (non-recurrent) revenue for the feudal lords, in exchange for the loss of power. Over time, the landlords sold more and more privileges. This resulted in a shift of power within the counties and duchies in the Low Countries from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie, starting in Flanders. Some of these cities even developed into city-states. The growing economic and military power concentrating in the cities led to a very powerful class of well-to-do merchants and traders.

== Common City rights ==
Privileges
*Defensive walls (the right to erect a defence wall around an inhabited area)
*Market right (the right to hold markets and receive income from them)
*Staple right (the right to store and exclusively trade particular goods, often only granted to a few cities)
*Toll right (the right to charge tolls)
*Mint right (the right to mint city coinage)
*Taxation (the right to levy taxes)
*Weighing (the right to organize official weighing: cargo, livestock, produce, building material, trading goods etc.) 
Freedoms
*Personal freedom (citizens had a relative degree of personal freedom in comparison to citizens of rural areas: they were not subject to the liege lord and had freedom of mobility) – Hence the old saying &quot;Stadslucht maakt vrij&quot; (&#x27;City air makes free&#x27;).
Governance
*Self-governance (Well-to-do citizens could sometimes elect local government officials)
*Judiciary and law-making (Within its boundaries the city could have a great degree of autonomy)

==Rights granted to the cities of present-day Belgium==
===Grants of city rights, alphabetically. ===
==Rights granted to the cities of present-day Luxembourg==
===Modern era===
&quot;Note several of the following were first granted city rights during the medieval period.&quot;
==Rights granted to the cities of the present-day Netherlands==
The first community in the contemporary Kingdom of the Netherlands to receive city rights was Deventer in 956. It can be argued that some cities have older rights: for instance Nijmegen may have been granted city status during the Roman Empire. Another case is Voorburg, which is built on the site of the Roman settlement Forum Hadriani and was granted city status in about AD 151, but was abandoned in the late 3rd century: thus the current settlement is not considered an uninterrupted continuation of the Roman city. At the end of the Middle Ages, the number of grants of city status fell dramatically.

The strong position of merchants and traders allowed the Netherlands to become the first modern republic in the 16th century.

===End of city rights===
The institution of city status gradually came to an end with the development and centralization of a national government. In the Netherlands the last city to receive real city rights (as defined above) was Willemstad in 1586. During the Dutch Republic, only Blokzijl gained city rights (in 1672). After the Batavian Revolution in 1795, municipalities were styled after the French model and city rights were abolished by law. Although partially restored after 1813, cities did not fully regain the authority they had previously had: law-making and the judiciary had become part of the state. After the Constitution of 1848 and the Municipal Law of 1851, the differences between the legal privileges of cities, towns, and villages were permanently erased.

In the early 19th century, when several important towns (especially The Hague) wanted to call themselves cities, the custom of granting city status was briefly revived. The last grant of city status in the Netherlands was to Delfshaven in 1825. But the city status granted during this period was quite different from the privileges bestowed in the Middle Ages, and were merely symbolic. This is also the case for cities such as The Hague and Assen, which received their status during the Napoleonic period.

<text>George Washington Hockley (1802 – June 6, 1854) was a Texas revolutionary who served as secretary of war for the Republic of Texas.

Hockley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were Thomas Hockley (1764-1805), a Philadelphia merchant, and his wife Mary Wescott (1764-1848). In the above-mentioned recollections of Mr. Howard, he states that then-Major Hockley was an executor of his aunt Patience Wescott of Philadelphia; she had owned 32,500 acres of land in Tipton County, Tennessee.

Hockley, serving in the Texas Army as a colonel, was in charge of the Twin Sisters at the decisive Battle of San Jacinto.

He was the secretary of war for the Republic of Texas during the first and second administrations of the new President Sam Houston. He served briefly in 1838 and again from 1841 to 1842. 

In 1843, Houston selected Hockley to serve as a military representative of a Texas diplomatic mission to Mexico. He met with Adrian Woll&#x27;s delegation at Sabinas, Mexico, where they discussed an amnesty offered by Antonio de Santa Anna to Texas, and proposed a withdrawal of Mexican troops from the Nueces Strip. Hockley and his colleague, Samuel May Williams, remained in Sabinas for six months. Although no agreement from these talks was legalized, they were successful in postponing the threat of a Mexican invasion for another year while Texas negotiated with the United States and Great Britain for protection through official recognition or annexation.

Hockley died on June 6, 1851, in Corpus Christi, Texas, and is interred at the city&#x27;s Old Bayview Cemetery. In 1936, the year of the Texas Centennial, the state erected a monument in his honor. 

Hockley County, Texas, was named in his honor.

He founded the town of Hockley, Texas, in 1835.

==In popular culture==
*In season 7 of &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot;, Victor Strand arms himself with a cutlass that had originally belonged to George Washington Hockley, telling Will in &quot;The Beacon&quot; that it dates back to the War of 1812. Strand briefly uses the sword in season 8 as well before it&#x27;s stolen from him.

<doc id="882553" wikidata="Q885392" url="?curid=882553" title="Garnishment">
<text>Garnishment is a legal process for collecting a monetary judgment on behalf of a plaintiff from a defendant. Garnishment allows the plaintiff (the &quot;garnishor&quot;) to take the money or property of the debtor from the person or institution that holds that property (the &quot;garnishee&quot;). A similar legal mechanism called execution allows the seizure of money or property held directly by the debtor.

Some jurisdictions may allow for garnishment by a tax agency without the need to first obtain a judgment or other court order.

== Wages==
Wage garnishment, the most common type of garnishment, is the process of deducting money from an employee&#x27;s monetary compensation (including salary), usually as a result of a court order. Wage garnishments may continue until the entire debt is paid or arrangements are made to pay off the debt. Garnishments can be taken for any type of debt but common examples of debt that result in garnishments include:
* Child support
* Defaulted student loans
* Taxes
* Unpaid court costs
* Court-ordered judgments

When served on an employer, garnishments are taken as part of the payroll process. When processing payroll, sometimes there is not enough money in the employee&#x27;s net pay to satisfy all of the garnishments. For example, in a case with federal tax, local tax, and credit card garnishments, the first garnishment taken would be the federal tax garnishments, then local tax garnishments, and, finally, garnishments for the credit card. Employers receive a notice telling them to withhold a certain amount of their employee&#x27;s wages for payment and cannot refuse to garnish wages. Employers must correctly calculate the amount to withhold, and must make the deductions until the garnishment expires.

Wage garnishment can negatively affect credit, reputation, and the ability to receive a loan or open a bank account.

At present four U.S. states—Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas—do not allow wage garnishment at all except for tax-related debt, child support, federally guaranteed student loans, and court-ordered fines or restitution. The federal garnishment limit (with some exceptions like child support and student loans) on a weekly basis is the lower of (A) 25% of one&#x27;s disposable earnings (what&#x27;s left after mandatory tax deductions), or (B) the total amount by which one&#x27;s weekly wage exceeds thirty times the federal hourly minimum wage. Several other states observe maximum thresholds that are lower than the maxima provided by federal law. States may also prohibit garnishment altogether in certain circumstances. For example, in Florida the wages of a person who provides more than half the support for a child or other dependent are exempt from garnishment altogether (though this is subject to waiver). Loans and negotiations with creditors can also help debtors to avoid wage garnishment.

In Minnesota, there are five limits on wage garnishment: Creditors cannot garnish wages for social security benefits, retirement benefits, welfare payments, workers&#x27; compensation benefits, or income associated with disability or unemployment insurance.

In many states when the person is an employee or appointee of a governmental unit the writ is called a Writ of Sequestration. These are processed by the courts in the same manner as garnishments and are subject to the same wage exemptions.

In the United States, firing an employee to avoid handling a levy may be a criminal offense. Federal law provides for a fine of up to $1,000 and imprisonment for up to one year on an employer who willfully fires an employee in connection with a garnishment of the employee&#x27;s earnings.

== Attachments ==
The other type of garnishment, also known as &quot;attachment&quot; (or attachment of earnings), requires the garnishee to deliver all the defendant&#x27;s money and/or property in the hands of the garnishee at the time of service of process to the court, to be paid over to the plaintiff. Since this type of garnishment is not continuing in nature, but is not subject to the type of restrictions that apply to wage garnishment, it is most often used against banks, or other persons or companies that incur liquidated obligations in the regular course of business. The garnishment should not begin during the pay period but instead on the following pay period.

=== Federal taxes ===
Under U.S. federal tax law, a garnishment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is a form of administrative levy. In the case of an IRS levy, no court order is required.

Only a few requirements must be met before the IRS starts a wage garnishment:
* The IRS must have assessed the tax and must have sent a written Notice and Demand for Payment;
* The taxpayer must have neglected or refused to pay the tax within the time prescribed in the notice&lt;/ref&gt;
; and,
* The IRS must have sent a Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right to A Hearing (levy notice) at least 30 days before the levy.

The IRS may serve the Final Notice in person, may leave the notice at the taxpayer&#x27;s home or usual place of business, or may send it to the last known address by certified or registered mail. The IRS is required to send the Final Notice to the last address known to the agency. The taxpayer does not need to actually receive the notice for the notice to be effective. Many taxpayers never actually receive the final notice. Those taxpayers may not realize they are in danger of receiving a levy until their wages are actually garnished.ha

===Student Loan Wage Garnishment Cleanup===

People who have their wages garnished due to default of educational loan payment can do four procedural things. 
The first thing to do is consolidate all the loans. This is not refinancing. It is enrolling in a plan or making 3 on time payments before the consolidation process. This most benefits those with federal student loans. 
Then during 10 consecutive months, make 9 monthly payments after entering a loan rehabilitation program. This action especially benefits people with federal loans. 
Then negotiate a repayment plan with the lender or debt collector. A lower debt repayment amount can be achieved. 
If there are other problems, then debtors can request to qualify for a reduced garnishment or there will be a 12 month pause on garnishing the wages.

<doc id="882557" wikidata="Q2546654" url="?curid=882557" title="Thomas M. Storke">
<text>Thomas More Storke (November 23, 1876 – October 12, 1971) was an American journalist, politician, postmaster, and publisher. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1962. Storke also served as an interim United States Senator, appointed to serve between the resignation of William Gibbs McAdoo in November 1938 and the January 1939 swearing-in of Sheridan Downey, who had been elected to succeed McAdoo.

== Early life and journalism career ==
Born in Santa Barbara, Storke was an only child who grew up bilingual in Spanish and English and was born to eminent local citizen and politician Charles A. Storke and Martha Storke. Through his mother he was descended from the Ortega and Olivera families. As a child he attended public schools and moved on to Stanford University one year early with a degree in economics. Storke graduated in 1898 at age 22.

In 1900, Storke borrowed $2,000 () and bought the &quot;Santa Barbara Daily Independent&quot;, the least favored newspaper in town. In 1909 he sold the outlet to get into the oil business and purchased the &quot;Santa Barbara Daily News&quot; in 1913. The spring prior, he was appointed as the Santa Barbara postmaster. Storke readopted the &quot;Daily Independent&quot; and combined that with the &quot;Daily News&quot; to birth the &quot;Santa Barbara Daily News &amp; Independent&quot;. Years later, Storke bought &quot;The Morning Press&quot;, Santa Barbara&#x27;s third paper. He later combined the two to create &quot;The Santa Barbara News-Press&quot;. After 23 years, it was sold for nearly $10 million to the publisher of &quot;The Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;.

== Later life and political career ==
A Democrat in politics, Storke was appointed to the United States Senate by Republican California Governor Frank F. Merriam on November 9, 1938, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William Gibbs McAdoo the day before. McAdoo had lost his bid for re-nomination, and he resigned his seat the day of the general election, won by Sheridan Downey, who had beaten McAdoo in the primary. Storke had not been a candidate for the seat, and served until the beginning of Downey&#x27;s term on January 3, 1939. Storke flew to Washington and was sworn in by Edwin H. Halsey, the Secretary of the Senate. However, Congress was not in session during the time he was in office, so Storke never authored any legislation or cast a Senate vote.

He returned home and resumed working in the media, merging his newspaper the &quot;Santa Barbara News&quot; with the &quot;Morning Press&quot; to create the Santa Barbara News-Press. He also founded AM radio station KTMS. He was a member of the California Crime Commission from 1951–1952, and the Board of Regents of the University of California from 1955 until 1960.

In 1958 Storke wrote &quot;California Editor&quot;, a lengthy memoir rich in local Santa Barbara history.

The John Birch Society attacked the Eisenhower administration and U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren as being communists in 1961. Storke responded with a caustic series of editorials in the &quot;News-Press&quot; which won him popular acclaim as well as a number of prizes. These included the Pulitzer Prize in Journalism, for Editorial Writing in 1962, the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award, and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College.

Storke died of a stroke in 1971 at age 94, having had 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

== Contributions ==
Storke used his political clout to help obtain the present UCSB campus, over 900 coastal acres (3.6 km2) and a former military installation, from the US Government under the college land grant program.

Part of Storke&#x27;s lasting legacy is Storke Tower, a 190-foot structure in the center of the UCSB campus, being the tallest tower in the county as well as the only five-octave chromatic bell system.

Beneath Storke Tower is the Storke Communication Plaza, which houses the offices of the campus &quot;Daily Nexus&quot; newspaper and the studios of community radio station KCSB-FM.

<text>Walter Ray Allen Jr. (born July 20, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player. Allen played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player in 2018. He is widely considered one of the greatest three-point shooters of all time. Allen was a ten-time NBA All-Star, and won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 2000 United States men&#x27;s basketball team. At the time of his retirement, he was the leading three-point scorer in NBA history until he was surpassed by Stephen Curry in 2021. As of 2025, he ranks third on the NBA&#x27;s all-time three-pointers list. In 2021, he was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

Allen played college basketball for the Connecticut Huskies for three seasons, before he was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft, and developed into a prolific scorer for the Milwaukee Bucks, featuring alongside Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell as the team achieved playoff success. In 2003, he was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics, where he solidified his reputation as a scorer, breaking several league records for three-point and free throw shooting. Allen was later traded to the Boston Celtics, where he formed a &quot;Big Three&quot; with Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce; the team won an NBA championship in 2008. After five seasons with the Celtics, he played with the Miami Heat for two seasons, reaching the NBA Finals both times and winning the title in 2013; his clutch three-pointer in the 2013 Finals to force overtime is regarded as one of the most iconic and memorable plays in NBA history. Allen retired on November 1, 2016, after playing for four different teams.

During his NBA career, Allen acted in some films, such as his role as basketball prodigy Jesus Shuttlesworth in Spike Lee&#x27;s basketball drama &quot;He Got Game&quot; (1998). Allen&#x27;s performance as Shuttlesworth was praised by critics, and the name was borrowed as Allen&#x27;s basketball nickname.

==Early life==
The third of five children, Allen was born at Castle Air Force Base near Merced, California, the son of Walter Sr. and Flora Allen. A military child, he spent time growing up in Saxmundham, Suffolk, England, in Altus, Oklahoma, at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and in Germany. After years of traveling and frequent moves, his family settled in Dalzell, South Carolina, for four years, where he would attend high school. When he first arrived, the young Allen was often the odd-man-out, picked on by other kids for the accent acquired during his formative years in Britain. Allen&#x27;s athletic gifts and work ethic allowed him to excel in sports. When a growth spurt left him with a natural advantage in basketball, he decided to dedicate his free time to becoming the best basketball player he possibly could.

Fueled by his desire to become the top player on his military base, Allen practiced at length daily, so long as it did not interfere with his studies. By the age of fifteen, he was playing for Hillcrest High School&#x27;s varsity team, and would eventually lead them to their first state championship. Allen scored 25 points and notched 12 rebounds in a blowout victory for Hillcrest Wildcats. At Hillcrest, he was teammates with future Major League Baseball player Terrell Wade. He drew much attention from college recruiters, especially from the University of Kentucky, but ultimately accepted an offer from the University of Connecticut.

==College career==
Allen attended the University of Connecticut from 1993 to 1996.

As a freshman with the Huskies in 1993–94, Allen came off the bench in 34 games he played, averaging 12.6 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.1 steals in 21.6 minutes per game. He was subsequently named to the Big East All-Freshman Team.

As a sophomore in 1994–95, Allen played 32 games with 31 starts, averaging 21.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.9 steals in 32.8 minutes per game. He was named first-team All-Big East.

As a junior in 1995–96, Allen started all 35 games and averaged 23.4 points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.7 steals in 34.7 minutes per game. He was named the Big East Player of the Year and earned first-team All-Big East. The Huskies won their third consecutive Big East Conference regular season title and played in their third consecutive NCAA Tournament.

Allen declared for the 1996 NBA draft. As of 2018, his 1,922 point total ranked fifth all-time, his 19.0 career average was fourth, his 44.8 three-point field goal percentage was first, and the 818 points he scored as a junior was the third-highest season total in UConn history.

In January 2001, Allen was named honorary captain of the 25-member UConn All-Century Basketball Team. In February 2007, he was an inaugural inductee in the UConn men&#x27;s basketball &quot;Huskies of Honor&quot; recognition program. In March 2019, his number 34 jersey was retired by UConn.

In May 2023, Allen graduated from UConn with a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in General Studies.

==NBA career==

===Milwaukee Bucks (1996–2003)===

====1996–1999: early years in Milwaukee====
Allen was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the fifth pick of the 1996 NBA draft. Immediately after his selection, Allen and Andrew Lang were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to fourth pick Stephon Marbury. On July 24, 1996, Allen signed a 3-year, $6.2 million contract with the Bucks. Allen made his NBA debut on November 1, 1996, where he started and played 28 minutes and scored 13 points in a win against fellow rookie Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 12, 1997, Allen put in one of his strongest efforts of the season in a win against the Golden State Warriors, contributing 22 points, 6 assists, 3 steals and a new career high of 9 rebounds. In February 1997, Allen competed in the Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star Weekend, where he finished fourth. Continuing his strong rookie season, on March 25, 1997, Allen scored a new career high of 32 points in a loss to the Phoenix Suns. Allen was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.

In the 1997–98 season, Allen played and started all 82 games for the Bucks. In the season opener, he put up 29 points, including 6 three-pointers in a win against the 76ers. On December 20, 1997, Allen set a new career high of 35 points against the New York Knicks. On the brink of missing the playoffs for the second straight year, on April 18, 1998, the last game of the regular season, Allen tallied a 40-point double-double with 10 rebounds.

====1999–2003: building his legacy====
On February 10, 1999, following the 1998–99 NBA lockout, Allen signed a six-year, $70.9 million extension with the Bucks, making him the highest paid player in franchise history at that point. The 1998–99 season saw Allen make his first playoff appearance, with the Bucks earning the seventh seed. There they were swept by the Indiana Pacers in the first round despite Allen averaging 22.3 points per game. The following season, on January 20, 2000, Allen recorded a career-high 13 assists in a loss to the Seattle SuperSonics. On February 3, 2000, Allen scored 36 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a 102–99 win against the Utah Jazz. A month later, Allen played in his first All-Star Game, where he had 14 points in 17 minutes. During the 1999–2000 season, Allen led the Bucks in scoring during the regular and post-season.

On February 7, 2001, Allen recorded his first career triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists against the Boston Celtics. A few days later, he participated and won his first 3-point shootout during All-Star Weekend. Allen, alongside Sam Cassell and Glenn Robinson, helped lead the Bucks to the Eastern Conference finals. Allen recorded a new playoff career high with 41 points in a Game 6 victory over the 76ers, but the Bucks ultimately lost in seven games. Allen earned All-NBA Third Team honors in 2001.

===Seattle SuperSonics (2003–2007)===

Allen remained with the Bucks midway through the 2002–03 season, when he was dealt to the Seattle SuperSonics, along with Ronald Murray, former UConn teammate Kevin Ollie, and a conditional first round draft pick, in exchange for Gary Payton and Desmond Mason. It was speculated that Allen&#x27;s contentious relationship with coach George Karl played a role in the Bucks&#x27; willingness to part with Allen.

After an injury-riddled 2003–04 season, Allen was named to the All-NBA Second Team in the 2004–05 season and, alongside teammate Rashard Lewis, led the Sonics to the 2005 Conference semifinals.

In July 2005, Allen signed a five-year, $85 million contract with the SuperSonics.

On March 12, 2006, Allen became the 97th player in NBA history to score 15,000 points. On April 7, 2006, Allen moved into second place on the NBA&#x27;s list of all-time 3-point field goals made, trailing only Reggie Miller. On April 19, 2006, Allen broke Dennis Scott&#x27;s ten-year-old NBA record for 3-point field goals made in a season in a game against the Denver Nuggets. The record was broken by Stephen Curry.

In the 2006–07 regular season, Allen averaged a career-high 26.4 points per game while adding 4.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. On January 12, 2007, he scored a career-high 54 points against the Utah Jazz in a 122–114 overtime win, the second most in Sonics history. Shortly after, he had ankle surgery on both ankles and missed the remainder of the 2006–07 season.

===Boston Celtics (2007–2012)===

==== 2007–2009: first championship ====
On June 28, 2007, the Sonics traded Allen and Glen Davis, the 35th overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, to the Celtics in exchange for Delonte West, Wally Szczerbiak, and the fifth overall pick, Jeff Green. Shortly after acquiring Allen, the Celtics acquired Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett to play alongside Allen and Paul Pierce. Upon joining the Celtics, Allen changed his jersey to number 20 because Paul Pierce already had number 34 in Boston.

On November 4, 2007, Allen passed 17,000 points for his career with his first of two 3-pointers in overtime in a 98–95 victory against the Toronto Raptors, in which he sank the game winning 3-pointer with three seconds remaining in overtime.
On February 13, 2008, Allen was named as the replacement for injured East All-Star Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards, who was out with a left hip flexor strain, for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. While LeBron James was given the All-Star MVP Award, many analysts, including the TNT commentators of the game, felt it should have gone to Allen, who scored 14 points in a stretch of 2 minutes and 30 seconds in the fourth quarter to seal the win for the East team.

On March 28, 2008, Allen was honored as the 3rd best of the 20 greatest players in franchise history during Milwaukee&#x27;s &quot;40th Anniversary Team Celebration&quot;, but could not attend the festivities because of the Celtics&#x27; game against the New Orleans Hornets. The Boston Celtics finished 66–16, and were the #1 seed in the 2008 NBA Playoffs. The Celtics struggled in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing every single away game, but maintaining an undefeated playoff record at home. The Celtics had defeated the #8 seeded Atlanta Hawks 4–3 and then defeated the #4 seeded Cleveland Cavaliers 4–3 as well. They advanced to the 2008 NBA Finals after a 4–2 Conference finals series win over the Detroit Pistons.

On June 12, 2008, Allen would play all 48 minutes and contribute greatly with 19 points and 9 rebounds in what would become the largest comeback in NBA Finals history, with the Celtics coming back from a 24-point deficit at one point in the second quarter and a deficit as large as 20 in the third. In that game, Allen would make the game clinching layup with 16.4 seconds remaining to give the Celtics a 5-point lead and put the game away.

On June 17, 2008, in the series-ending Game 6 of the NBA Finals, Allen tied an NBA Finals record with seven three-pointers in the Celtics&#x27; 131–92 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. With the victory, Allen secured his first NBA championship.
On February 5, 2009, Allen was named as the All-Star replacement for Orlando Magic point guard Jameer Nelson. This marked Allen&#x27;s ninth time on the All-Star team and the second straight year he had made it alongside teammates Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.

On February 22, 2009, with his streak ending at 72, Allen broke the Celtics franchise record in consecutive free throws made previously set by Larry Bird (71).

In the first round of the 2009 playoffs against the Chicago Bulls, game one proved to be tough for Allen. He ended up shooting 1–11 from the field, and the Celtics lost by two. In game 2 however, Allen nailed the game winning three-pointer at the end of regulation with two seconds left to cap off an impressive 30 point night. In Game 6, despite a Boston loss, Allen managed to score 51 points. Boston ended up winning the series in 7 Games. He reunited with former teammate and co-captain of the Seattle SuperSonics, Rashard Lewis in the conference semifinals, that time as opponents, however. After 4 games and a 2–2 series tie, his highest scoring game was a 22-point performance in a Game 2 victory. The Celtics went on to lose in seven games as they failed to defend their title.

==== 2009–2012: finals upset and 3-point record ====
On December 10, 2009, Allen scored 18 points to reach the 20,000 point total for his career.

On June 6, 2010, in Game 2 of the 2010 NBA Finals in a 103–94 victory against the Los Angeles Lakers, Allen set a then record for most three-pointers made in an NBA Finals game on 8–11 shooting to tie the series 1–1. He broke Michael Jordan&#x27;s record of six three-pointers in one half by hitting seven in the first half and had tied Scottie Pippen and Kenny Smith&#x27;s record for most three-pointers in one game in the NBA Finals by half time. Allen also became the first player in NBA history to have two separate games of scoring at least seven three-pointers in the NBA Finals. The Celtics would win two of three games in Boston, before losing the last two games and the series in Los Angeles.

After becoming a free agent on July 1, 2010, Allen re-signed a two-year deal with the Boston Celtics on July 7 worth $20 million.

During a game against the Los Angeles Lakers on February 10, 2011, Allen became the all-time NBA leader in total three-pointers made (2,562), surpassing Reggie Miller&#x27;s record of 2,560. The 35-year-old shooting guard finished the game with 20 points but the Celtics eventually lost 92–86. In the 2010–11 NBA season Allen was named to his tenth All-Star game alongside teammates Rajon Rondo, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. Also during All-Star Weekend, Allen competed in the Three-Point Shootout, but lost to James Jones of the Miami Heat.

During the 2011–12 NBA season, Allen was privately frustrated with trade rumors in February, issues with teammate Rajon Rondo, and an ankle injury that ultimately required surgery in June 2012 to remove bone spurs. The Celtics lost in seven games to the Miami Heat in the 2012 Eastern Conference finals.

===Miami Heat (2012–2014)===

==== 2012–2013: second championship ====
Allen&#x27;s initial plan in the summer of 2012 was to stay with the Boston Celtics. He was reportedly seeking a three-year, $24 million contract whereas the Celtics were offering a two-year, $12 million deal. Further internal discord with a bench role and a Rondo-focused approach led to Allen rejecting the Celtics and instead choosing to sign a two-year, $6 million deal with the Miami Heat. The Heat were limited to their mid-level exception amount of slightly more than $3 million per season.

During Allen&#x27;s first season with the Miami Heat, he averaged 10.9 points per game and made 88.6% of his free throws while playing an average of 25.8 minutes per game. On April 25, 2013, while playing Milwaukee in Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, Allen made his 322nd career three-pointer in the playoffs, which broke Reggie Miller&#x27;s record for most three-pointers made in NBA playoff history. Allen returned to his favorite #34 jersey upon joining the Heat.
In Game 6 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, as the Heat trailed by three points, Allen made a game-tying 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left in the fourth quarter to force overtime. Having rallied from a 10-point deficit at the end of the third quarter, the Heat won in overtime 103–100 over the San Antonio Spurs and forced a seventh game in the series. With the Heat leading 101–100, Allen stole the ball from Manu Ginóbili under the Spurs&#x27; basket and drew a foul with 1.9 seconds remaining in the overtime period. Allen made both ensuing free throws to put Miami up 103–100. Allen played 41 minutes in Game 6 off the bench and scored 9 points on 3-for-8 field goal shooting; his game-tying three-pointer was the only three-pointer he made in three attempts. Allen also had one defensive rebound and two assists. In Game 7, which the Heat won 95–88 to win its second consecutive championship, Allen played 20 minutes off the bench. Although he made none of 4 field goal attempts and had 3 turnovers, Allen recorded 4 defensive rebounds and 4 assists.

==== 2013–2014: final playing year ====
On June 29, 2013, Allen picked up his $3.23 million player option to stay with the Heat through the 2013–14 NBA season. During the regular season, Allen played in 73 games, starting 9 of them, averaging 9.6 points and shooting 37 percent from three-point range. In the playoffs, Allen scored 19 points on 4–7 three-point shooting in game 4 of the conference semifinals against the Brooklyn Nets. Then in Game 3 against the Indiana Pacers in an Eastern Conference finals rematch, Allen hit four 3-point shots in the fourth quarter and put them up 2–1 in the series. The Heat won the series in six games to advance to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight year and Allen&#x27;s second. The Heat faced the Spurs again in the 2014 NBA Finals, but they lost the series in five games.

===Retirement===
Allen became a free agent in the 2014 off-season, and after much anticipation of a return at some point during the 2014–15 season, he announced his decision to sit out the season and focus on 2015–16. However, he did not end up joining a team. In July 2016, Allen began mulling a comeback, and admitted he was &quot;intrigued&quot; by the possibility of competing for another championship. The following month, Allen had talks with the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks regarding a possible return, but ultimately decided to officially retire on November 1, 2016. In September 2018, Allen was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In February 2019, Allen played in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. In October 2021, Allen was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Team. He was also named in the top 75 players by &quot;The Athletic&quot;.

==Acting career==
In 1998, Allen co-starred alongside Denzel Washington in the Spike Lee film &quot;He Got Game&quot; as high school basketball phenomenon Jesus Shuttlesworth. Roger Ebert praised his performance and said Allen &quot;is that rarity: an athlete who can act,&quot; while &quot;New York&quot; magazine described him as &quot;graceful and fast in the basketball scenes&quot; while giving &quot;a somberly effective minimalist performance.&quot; His role as Jesus Shuttlesworth earned him that name as a nickname from teammates and fans. Allen also appeared as Marcus Blake in the 2001 film &quot;Harvard Man&quot;. In 2015, Allen co-starred alongside Kyrie Irving, Baron Davis and J. B. Smoove as Walt in the fourth episode of &quot;Uncle Drew&quot;, a series of Pepsi Max advertisements written and directed by Irving.

==Personal life==
Allen married singer/actress Shannon Walker Williams on August 16, 2008, after having dated since 2004. They have four children together.

Allen says that he has a borderline case of obsessive–compulsive disorder, to which he attributes his consummate shooting style.

Allen served as NBA Spokesperson for the Jr. NBA / Jr. WNBA program and was selected as NBA Spokesman for the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. He also started the &quot;Ray of Hope&quot; Foundation to assist charities in several communities.

Former President Obama appointed Allen to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. Allen is a longtime supporter of the Holocaust Memorial Museum and has brought teammates and friends to the museum on frequent visits. In August 2017, he penned a first-person article for &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot;, entitled &quot;Why I Went to Auschwitz&quot;.

On November 21, 2017, Allen said in a court filing that he was the victim of &quot;catfishing&quot; by a man who posed online as several different women. In an emergency motion, Allen was responding to a claim made by the man, Bryant Coleman, that he was being stalked by Allen.

Allen&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;From the Outside&quot;, was released on March 27, 2018.

On July 18, 2021, Allen suffered injuries in a serious bicycle crash, and he credited his bicycle helmet with effectively saving his life.

On August 20, 2021, Allen accepted a position as director of boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball and boys&#x27; varsity basketball head coach at Gulliver Preparatory School.

In the spring of 2023, Allen received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in General Studies from the University of Connecticut.

<text>Kirkham is a village in the civil parish of Westow, in North Yorkshire, England, close to Malton, situated in the Howardian Hills alongside the River Derwent, and is notable for the nearby ruins of Kirkham Priory, an Augustinian establishment.

Kirkham was historically an extra parochial area in the East Riding of Yorkshire. It became a civil parish in 1866. On 1 April 1935 the civil parish was abolished and merged into the civil parish of Firby. In 1931 the parish had a population of 31.

In 1974 it was transferred to the new county of North Yorkshire. From 1974 to 2023 it was a part of the Ryedale district and when the parish of Firby was abolished it joined the parish of Westow.

Kirkham was served by Kirkham Abbey railway station on the York to Scarborough Line between 1845 and 1930.

John Oxley (1785-1828), an explorer of south-east Australia, was born here.

<doc id="882565" wikidata="Q2428471" url="?curid=882565" title="Georgia State Route 316">
<text>State Route 316 (SR 316), also known as University Parkway, or Georgia 316, is a state highway that exists in the northern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It links the Atlanta metropolitan area with Athens, home of the University of Georgia.

The first of the state highway is a freeway, but the rest of the route is at-grade with traffic signals with the exception of its junction with SR 81 east of Bethlehem.

Despite SR 316 being concurrent with US 29 for most of its route, the road is nearly always referred to by its state route designation, while US 29 is usually associated with its original route.

SR 316 could possibly be extended as a freeway from its Buford Drive exit to the Athens Perimeter on its current route, intersecting roads like Winder Highway (US 29 Business), Sugarloaf Parkway (current interchange), SR 81 (Loganville Highway), SR 53 (Hog Mountain Road), and US 78/SR 10 (current interchange).

==Route description==
===Gwinnett County===
SR 316 begins at an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85) exit 106, west of Lawrenceville. The route heads east, and then northeast, to interchanges with SR 120, Riverside Parkway, Sugarloaf Parkway, and Collins Hills Road/SR 20/SR 124, all in Lawrenceville. Then the route becomes an at-grade highway. Northeast of the city is a major intersection: US 29/SR 8 come in from the west and intersect SR 316. At the intersection, SR 8 continues to the northeast, concurrent with US 29 BUS, while SR 316 has a concurrency with US 29. From then on, the speed limit is raised from 55 to 65 miles per hour. GA 316 continues to head east into rural Gwinnett County. Next, there is an interchange with the Sugarloaf Parkway freeway extension. The last major intersection is at Harbins Road. Finally, the road heads over the Appalachee River into rural Barrow County.

===Barrow County===

South of Winder, the two routes meet SR 81 at an interchange. To the east, at Bethlehem, is an intersection with SR 11. Then they encounter SR 53 southeast of Winder and at Statham they intersect SR 211.

===Oconee County===
Southeast of Bogart, the two routes intersect US 78/SR 10, which come in from the southwest. At the intersection, SR 10 continues to the northeast, concurrent with US 78 BUS, while the US 78 mainline joins the US 29/SR 316 concurrency. US 29/US 78/SR 316 intersect SR 10 Loop/SR 422 (Paul Broun Parkway/Athens Perimeter Highway) southwest of Athens. Here, SR 316 has its eastern terminus, while US 29/US 78 join SR 10 Loop/SR 422 in a concurrency to the east.

==History==
The first portion of the highway was completed as a freeway to Lawrenceville in 1960, after the city was bypassed by I-85. With the subsequent expansion of Atlanta into its eastern suburbs, travel between the capital and Athens became increasingly difficult as highways US 29 and US 78 were both routed through multiple business districts. Over the next decades, the state completed SR 316 in sections, weaving along the original route of US 29 in order to bypass communities and business districts, including Winder and the congested Atlanta Highway in Athens. On October 22, 2020, the highway&#x27;s junction with SR 81 was upgraded to an interchange. The project to upgrade the junction cost 26.4 million dollars.

===Gwinnett junction with I-85===
In 2006, the Georgia Department of Transportation upgraded the interchange of I-85 and SR 316 with new bridges and collector/distributor (C/D) lanes involving Pleasant Hill Road, Boggs Road, and State Route 120. By utilizing one of these flyover bridges, drivers travelling westbound on SR 316 can access Pleasant Hill Road independently from I-85 southbound traffic. Another flyover built carried two new lanes of traffic going towards Atlanta on I-85 from SR 316. An HOV-only lane was converted to an express lane in 2011.

==Future==
SR 316 is scheduled to receive a number of improvements resulting in the entire route becoming a limited-access highway. This includes projects at SR 53 and SR 11. A new interchange at Harbins Road opened in 2022.

<text>Razorlight are an English indie rock band, formed in 2002 in London by lead singer and guitarist Johnny Borrell. Along with Borrell, the current line-up of the band is composed of founding members Björn Ågren on guitar and bassist Carl Delemo, as well as drummer Andy Burrows. This lineup is a reunion of the lineup from the band&#x27;s second and third albums.

The band have gone through several line-up changes, with Borrell remaining the sole permanent member. They released three studio albums before splitting up in 2014. The band reformed in 2017 and released the album &quot;Olympus Sleeping&quot; in 2018.

They are best known for the singles &quot;Golden Touch&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Else&quot;, &quot;In The Morning&quot; and &quot;America&quot;, the latter of which was a number-one single on the UK Singles Chart in 2006.

==History==
===Formation and early years (2002–2003)===
The band was formed in 2002 by Johnny Borrell, after having performed across London with the likes of The Libertines as a solo acoustic singer-songwriter. It is often reported that Borrell was a member of the Libertines, but Carl Barat has since revealed that he was just taught the bass lines for four songs to play for a showcase for Rough Trade Records and failed to turn up for it and never played with the band live. Borrell first enlisted Swedish-born guitarist Björn Ågren via an advert in the NME, who then introduced fellow-Swede bassist Carl Dalemo to Borrell. They rehearsed in east London for six months before playing their first gig on 17 September 2002 at Dingwalls in Camden, London supporting the Von Bondies. Former NME journalist Roger Morton, who had been managing the band from the beginning, began looking to get the band into a recording studio and a session was booked at Liam Watson&#x27;s Toe Rag Studios to record early versions of the tracks &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Lies&quot; and &quot;In the City&quot;. The results of these sessions gained radio play on the John Kennedy Show on XFM who described the band as being &quot;the best unsigned band in Britain&quot;, and led to A&amp;R attention. Following a bidding war to sign the band, they signed to Mercury Records.

=== &quot;Up All Night&quot; (2004–2005) ===
The band released their debut album &quot;Up All Night&quot; on 28 June 2004, reaching number 3 in the UK album charts. The critical reception was generally positive, receiving good reviews from &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; magazine and &quot;Billboard&quot;. Drummer Shïan Smith-Pancorvo left the band in April and was replaced by Andy Burrows the following month. &quot;Up All Night&quot; was re-issued in April 2005, including the stand-alone single &quot;Somewhere Else&quot; as a bonus track, and peaked at Number 2.
In July 2005, the band performed at Hyde Park, London as part of the Live 8 series of concerts. However, the band came under fire for being the only band to not donate their extra revenue to charity. The band subsequently claimed that due to their &quot;fledgling status&quot;, they were unable to make such a commitment.

Razorlight contributed the song &quot;Kirby&#x27;s House&quot; to the War Child charity album &quot;Help!: A Day in the Life&quot;. A shorter alternative version of the song was included on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Razorlight&quot;.

In the midst of their first American headlining tour in support of &quot;Up All Night&quot;, Razorlight created a stir in Denver, Colorado, when they stormed off stage five songs into their set during a show at the Larimer Lounge. After stumbling around stage, frontman Borrell shouted into the microphone &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill myself now,&quot; and ran off the stage. The band&#x27;s official statement stated that he was suffering from stagefright.

A later laryngitis infection led to the cancellation of the Los Angeles date of the tour.

===&quot;Razorlight&quot; (2006–2007)===
Razorlight debuted several new songs from their forthcoming second album live on 30 March 2006 at the Albert Hall in London, as part of Teenage Cancer Trust concerts, organised by Roger Daltrey. On 2 July, they played to a sold-out Hyde Park Calling, where they performed before The Who. The band went on to play on the beach opposite Brighton&#x27;s West Pier on 12 July in a free concert as part of a Vodafone TBA event broadcast on Channel 4.

Razorlight released their second album &quot;Razorlight&quot; on 17 July 2006, in the United Kingdom and it debuted at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart a week later. It received mixed reviews, &quot;Q&quot; magazine giving it a rare 5/5 rating, whilst Pitchfork Media gave it 2.8/10. The lead single from the album, &quot;In the Morning&quot; was released as a single on 3 July 2006, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. To date, it is their third biggest single after &quot;Somewhere Else&quot;, which peaked at No. 2, and &quot;America&quot;, which peaked at No. 1. It also reached No. 2 on iTunes. In 2007, Razorlight were nominated for two BRIT Awards – one for Best British Band and the other for Best Song, &quot;America&quot;. They were also nominated for two NME Brit Awards for Best Band and Best Album.

Razorlight supported Queen + Paul Rodgers on 15 July, in front of 60,000 people. This gig had been rescheduled following the July 2005 London bombings. In December of the same year, they supported Oasis, at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium. They also supported The Rolling Stones in Cologne and Paris. The band played their biggest tour to date in October–November 2006 and also supported Richard Ashcroft at the Lancashire County Cricket Club on 17 June. They headlined Reading on 24 August, and Leeds on 25 August 2007. They also played the Main Stage on 19 May in Preston for Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend alongside bands such as Kasabian and Kaiser Chiefs. On 7 July 2007, Razorlight performed at both the UK leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium, London and T in the Park. In November 2006 the band were hospitalised after traces of radioactive poisoning were detected on their plane. Their British Airways return flight from Moscow was a scheduled route used by Russian ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko.
The same month they supported the Mando Diao &quot;Ode to Ochrasy Tour&quot; in Germany.

===&quot;Slipway Fires&quot; and Burrows&#x27; departure (2008–2009)===

Razorlight were due to perform for BBC Children in Need 2008, but were forced to cancel due to Borrell suffering with vocal problems. The band made a donation to the charity. After months of working on new material, some of which was written by Borrell on the island of Tiree in the Inner Hebrides, Razorlight released their third studio album, &quot;Slipway Fires&quot;, on 3 November 2008 with the lead single, &quot;Wire to Wire&quot;, released on 20 October 2008. The second single from the album, &quot;Hostage of Love&quot;, however, received little commercial attention and failed to enter the charts. As a result, a planned third single &quot;Burberry Blue Eyes&quot; was cancelled. Borrell later stated that the album was their weakest, and that the &quot;album was just about greed – that&#x27;s the only way I see that record&quot;. He added that after writing songs in the Inner Hebrides &quot;I came back to London and the label had already booked studio time even though I wasn&#x27;t really confident in the songs. The songs I wrote came from this place of total mental breakdown and they were shoe-horned into a pop album, which just didn&#x27;t work. I was very conscious that I didn&#x27;t tell anyone in the band what I thought about their part of a song, because I couldn&#x27;t face the consequences of saying that and the tantrums that would ensue&quot;.

On 5 March 2009, it was announced that Andy Burrows had quit the band to &quot;pursue other musical ventures&quot;. Johnny Borrell stated that although &quot;over the last two albums and five years Andy has been an integral part of Razorlight and we will miss him&quot;, the band would continue. Burrows initially claimed that his time with the band had been &quot;an amazing experience&quot;, but later went on to state that he &quot;hated being in the band. Johnny and I didn&#x27;t get on. Now I&#x27;ve got my freedom. He never wanted people to know that we both wrote songs&quot;. A well publicised fight between Borrell and Burrows occurred in 2006 at the Hawley Arms in Camden, London over songwriting credits for the song &quot;America&quot; with it being reported that Burrows was the main songwriter of the song. In 2019, Burrows revealed that he had bumped into Borrell in central London three years prior and was &quot;brushed off&quot;. He stated that Borrell &quot;acted like I was a stranger, it was the weirdest thing. I think I went off and got extremely drunk, but felt very weird for a couple of days… it was almost like seeing a ghost&quot;. In 2016, Borrell admitted that the band were collaborative and that Burrows had helped shape the sound of the second album, stating that &quot;I rate the drummer Andy Burrows. He was a great drummer with a melodic ear – but if you want to figure out who was taking Razorlight in which direction, then maybe have a listen to what we&#x27;re each doing now. I&#x27;m playing psychedelic blues-tango, and his stuff is so middle of the road it&#x27;s got more white lines than Liam Gallagher in 1997&quot;.

Following Burrows&#x27; departure, the band enlisted David &#x27;Skully&#x27; Sullivan Kaplan as a temporary replacement to fulfil live commitments, and soon became an official member. He had previously worked for the band&#x27;s booking agent. With a top 5 album and single in Germany, the band toured America, Australia and Europe before returning to the UK for shows in May at The O2 and Manchester Evening News Arena followed by UK festivals. Towards the end of the album tour cycle, the band previewed the new song &quot;Dr. Boushitan&quot; at several German gigs.

===Aborted fourth album, Dalemo and Ågren&#x27;s departure and hiatus (2009–2019)===
In December 2009, Borrell revealed that the band were working with Steve Lillywhite and Dave McCracken on a new album and that they were eager to get the new songs out &quot;soon&quot;. However, a UK and Europe tour of December 2010 featured an unannounced new band line-up. The band previewed several new tracks on tour, including Vertical Women and If It Bleeds.

On 26 January 2011 it was officially announced that Dalemo and Ågren had left the band, having &quot;agreed on an amicable parting following unproductive early recording sessions for a new album late last year&quot;. The duo were replaced by guitarist Gus Robertson and bassist Freddie Stitz The new line-up was officially revealed on 26 January 2011 via a new press photo. The photo was widely mocked on social media. Borrell responded that &quot;if people were laughing, then good! You shouldn&#x27;t change what people ridicule you for, because in reality it&#x27;s your strength&quot;.

The new line-up of the band, with Borrell as the only original member, toured the UK and Europe in September and October 2011. The band played several festivals including Get Loaded in the Park on Clapham Common on Sunday 12 June, Guilfest on 16 July 2011 and Shakedown Festival in Brighton on 17 September 2011. The band also headlined OsFest in Shropshire on 3 June 2012, Splendour Festival in Nottingham on 21 July 2012, Bingley Music Live on 1 September 2012 and The Big Feastival the next day on 2 September 2012.

In May 2011, Borrell revealed that the new band line-up were continuing work on the fourth album, and that they were &quot;really gelling as a band and a group of people and we&#x27;re really enjoying working together. There&#x27;s a really good atmosphere, it feels great, really, really good. There are some songs coming together. But it&#x27;ll be ready when it&#x27;s ready&quot;. The band were set to work with either former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler or Steve Lillywhite producing. In October 2012, Kaplan confirmed that they had completed the album and were waiting to mix it. He revealed further song titles, &quot;Good To Be Dead&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot; and &quot;Reveal Yourself&quot;.

However, on 27 March 2013, Borrell announced that Razorlight was to be put on hold whilst he prepared to release solo material. Borrell later revealed that Mercury refused to release the album, stating that the band &quot;really felt we had a record that we wanted to put out, but my label was very fractured and it was very hard to communicate with them. The label was focused on having a super-mega hit&quot;.

In July 2013, he released his debut solo album &quot;Borrell 1&quot; via Stiff Records. The album sold poorly, with the record label releasing a statement poking fun at the fact that it sold only 594 copies in its first week of release. When questioned about the statement, Borrell responded that he &quot;had almost no knowledge of that statement and I&#x27;m not sure who put it out or even what it said. My manager told me that it was really weird and, yeah, it was really weird&quot; and that &quot;labels are scum&quot;.

Following the commercial failure of the solo album and despite the hiatus announced the previous year, Razorlight began playing numerous festival through 2014 and 2015, such as Y Not Festival,
Tartan Heart Festival, Festival Internacional de Benicàssim and Volksfest in Plymouth. On 4 June 2014 at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, Razorlight played on the tenth anniversary of their debut album. João Mello, an 18-year-old Brazilian who played saxophone on Borrell&#x27;s solo project, played bass.

=== &quot;Olympus Sleeping&quot; and return of Ågren (2018–2019) ===
While announcing his solo single &quot;My World, Your Life&quot; on 3 May 2018, Borrell also announced that a new Razorlight album would be released that year. The album was released on 26 October, titled &quot;Olympus Sleeping&quot;. Four songs were immediately released with promo videos, along with the announcement of a UK tour. Borrell stated that the album &quot;was about embracing English indie guitar pop&quot;. The song &quot;Good Night&quot; was previously played live in 2013 prior to the hiatus with Kaplan receiving a songwriting credit.

The new line-up featured guitarist David Ellis (who co-wrote several of the songs on the album and also appeared on Borrell&#x27;s solo single &quot;My World, Your Life&quot;), bassist Harry Deacon (formerly of Kid Wave) and drummer David Kaplan.

Although drummer David Kaplan appeared in press shots for the album and toured in support of it, the album was recorded with drummer Martin Chambers. Borrell met Chambers at a David A. Stewart birthday gig and asked him if he&#x27;d like to play on the new album. Ellis and Borrell shared bass duties on the album. Kaplan left the band sometime in mid-2019. In July 2019, the band released the stand-alone single &quot;Cops &amp; Robbers&quot;, which featured Borrell on drums.

In November 2019, it was announced that original guitarist Björn Ågren had rejoined the band and would be taking part in the December 2019 tour. The duo were joined by keyboardist Reni Lane, bassist Ben Ellis and drummer Mat Hector. Ellis and Deacon left the band sometime prior to the tour. In 2020, the band released the single &quot;Burn, Camden, Burn&quot;, which was recorded in 2009. It features on the Apple TV series &quot;Trying&quot;.

=== Return of Burrows and Dalemo, &quot;Planet Nowhere&quot; ===
In April 2021, the band announced the return of the original lineup, featuring Borrell and Ågren, as well as Andy Burrows and Carl Dalemo with a livestreamed concert to be held on 2 June 2021.This marked the first appearance of the classic lineup in over a decade.

In an August 2021 interview, Carl Dalemo told local Swedish newspaper &quot;Nya Lidköpings-Tidningen&quot; that the band had been working on new music since April. Dalemo added that with him living in Sweden, and COVID-19 complicating travel, he was not able to make it to some of the gigs during early summer.
With the reformed lineup, Razorlight released a greatest hits album with two newly-recorded tracks in 2022 and underwent a UK tour in spring 2023, culminating with a show at Hammersmith Odeon in London. The show was relocated from Brixton Academy after the venue was closed due to the fatal concert crush in December.

In July 2024, Razorlight announced their fifth album &quot;Planet Nowhere&quot;, which was released on 25 October.

<doc id="882574" wikidata="Q3849580" url="?curid=882574" title="Anak Tomb No. 3">
<text>Anak Tomb No. 3 is a chamber tomb of Goguryeo located in Anak, South Hwanghae, North Korea. It is known for mural paintings and an epitaph. It is part of the Complex of Koguryo Tombs.

It was discovered in 1949 with valuable treasures stolen, but murals in good condition.

== Epitaph and its interpretation ==

The Anak Tomb No.3 is one of few Goguryeo tombs that have epitaphs so that their dates can be determined. Its seven-lined epitaph contains the date 357, the personal name Dong Shou (冬壽), his title, his birthplace and his age at death. Accordingly, some scholars generally regard this site as the tomb of Dong Shou. The inscription of Dong Shou relates that he was a general from the Xianbei state of Former Yan in Liaodong (modern Liaoning, China), who fled to Goguryeo in 336 and was given a position in the former territory of the Lelang commandery. Chinese scholar Yeh Pai who deciphered the inscription in 1951 and published his findings in North Korea&#x27;s Institute of Archeology report and argued that the man was the same Dong Shou, a refugee from Liaodong who fled the Xianbei invasions in 337, as the one who appeared in two Chinese histories, the &quot;Chin shu&quot; and &quot;Tzu-chih t&#x27;ung-chien&quot;. Yeh Pai&#x27;s conclusions were accepted in the 1958 formal Korean report; however some Korean scholars still maintained that the tomb belongs to King Mi-chon. While K. H. J. Gardiner and Wonyong Kim believe this to be a Chinese tomb of excellent quality, North and other South Korean scholars believe that Dong Shou was an emigre official. Moreover, the quality of these paintings and the size of the tomb indicate that it is a royal tomb of Koguryo—a theory advocated recently by Hwi-joon Ahn and Youngsook Pak. North Korean scholars claim that it is the mausoleum of King Micheon or King Gogugwon.

The epitaph reflects a complex situation in which Dong Shou, and Goguryeo, were put. He claimed various titles including &quot;Minister of Lelang&quot; and &quot;Governor of Changli, Xuantu and Daifang.&quot; It is not clear whether these titles were given by the Eastern Jin or just self-designation. Scholars associate one of his title &quot;Minister of Lelang&quot; with the title &quot;Duke of Lelang&quot;, which was bestowed on King Gogugwon by Murong Jun of the Former Yan in 354.

== Murals ==
The Anak Tomb No. 3 is the host to multiple famous mural paintings, each giving a greater insight to the life and hierarchy of the Goguryeo people. It contains two portraits, one on the front wall of the west side chamber and one on the southern wall, portraying a man and a woman, respectively. Scholars have disputed the owner of this tomb and thus the identity of people portrayed in these murals; because of the epitaph, many believe that the images depict Dong Shou, a refugee from Former Yan, and his wife, while others believe that the person depicted was the Goguryeo king, King Gogukwon. The man in the mural is shown to be sitting upright and is flanked by other men who are smaller than him. He is dressed in red silk clothes with a white &quot;kwan&quot; over a black inner &quot;kwan&quot; and is staring straight out with an impersonal expression. The painting of the woman resides on the southern wall of the tomb, next to that of the man, and her sitting position is slightly turned in to face him. The woman also wears an impersonal expression, but with a notable face shape; her face, as well as the faces of the women who flank her, is round and full, different from the typical facial structure of the Goguryeo people, who had long and oval faces. The woman is however wearing Chinese set of attire called guiyi, which is a multi-lap swallow-tail clothing; this reflects Chinese influences in the tomb and may indicate the clothing style worn in the Chinese six dynasties. The woman&#x27;s hairstyle is identical to the hairstyle in Northern Wei.

The next mural in this tomb is a procession scene and resides in the corridor. It contains 250 people, including the owner of the tomb who is sitting in a cow-pulled wagon. Other Goguryeo people displayed in this mural include members of a marching band, flag bearers, maids and civil officials. The large number of people suggests the high social status of the owner. It is also important to note the seemingly identical, impersonal facial structure of the people included in this scene. This can be attributed to the fact that at the time when this mural was developed, the expression of individuality was not yet a developed technique in Goguryeo paintings.

The inside of the eastern chamber contains a colorful mural illustrating the typical life of the Goguryeo people. The scene includes a kitchen, a meat storage room, a barn, a carriage shed, and household staff, along with other commonplace features. This mural allows scholars to analyze the daily rituals of the Goguryeo culture, and gain insight on what the house of the tomb&#x27;s owner may have looked like.

<text>The ruins of Kirkham Priory are situated on the banks of the River Derwent, at Kirkham, North Yorkshire, England. The Augustinian priory was founded in the 1120s by Walter l&#x27;Espec, lord of nearby Helmsley, who also built Rievaulx Abbey. The priory was surrendered in 8 December 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Legend has it that Kirkham was founded in remembrance of l&#x27;Espec&#x27;s only son who had died nearby as a consequence of his horse being startled by a boar.
The area was later used to test the D-Day landing vehicles, and was visited by Winston Churchill. The ruins are now Grade I listed and a scheduled monument in the care of English Heritage.

==Gatehouse ruins==

The Gatehouse of Kirkham Priory, built , is a specimen of English Gothic medieval architecture. It is a rare survival of such a gatehouse, comparable to that of Butley Priory in Suffolk. It has a wide arch of continuous mouldings with a crocketed gable running up to the windows, with sculptures of St George and the Dragon on the left, and David and Goliath to the right. Above the arch is Christ in a pointed oval recess, plus two figures below of St Bartholomew and St Philip, in niches. There are also many escutcheons with the armorials of the various benefactors of the Priory, including the arms of de Ros, Scrope, de Forz, Vaux, FitzRalph &amp; Espec (3 cart-wheels, each with 6 spokes).

* Arms of Scrope: &quot;Azure, a bend or&quot;
* Arms of de Forz
* Arms of de Clare
* Arms of de Ros

==Burials==
*Sir William de Ros (b. before 1200 – d. ca. 1264/1265), father of Robert de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros.
*Robert de Ros (died 1285)
*William de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros
*William de Ros, 2nd Baron de Ros
*Ralph Greystoke, 5th Baron Greystoke

==Preparation for D-Day landings in the Second World War==
During the Second World War, the priory was used by the military in training for what became the largest seaborne invasion in history, the D-Day landings which took place on 6 June 1944. Amongst units moved to Kirkham were the British 11th armoured division, the aim being to give drivers experience of manoeuvring and to test various waterproofing compounds and to gain experience with equipment to be used in the landings. Tanks, jeeps and other military vehicles destined for the landings were put through their paces at the priory and on the banks of the River Derwent. Troops made use of the high wall of the Western Cloister in training with scrambling nets, which they would subsequently use to make their way from the main transport ships into the smaller landing craft during the invasion. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and King George VI visited the priory in secret to monitor preparations, an indication of Kirkham&#x27;s significance as a training ground.

<doc id="882607" wikidata="Q1154146" url="?curid=882607" title="Kickball">
<text>Kickball (also known as soccer baseball in most of Canada and football rounders in the United Kingdom) is a team sport and league game, similar to baseball. Like baseball, it is a safe haven game in which one team tries to score by having its players return a ball from home base to the field and then circle the bases. Meanwhile, the other team tries to stop them by tagging them &quot;out&quot; with the ball before they can return to home base. However, instead of hitting a small, hard ball with a bat, players kick an inflated rubber ball; this makes it more accessible to young children. As in baseball, teams alternate half-innings. The team with the most runs after a predefined number of innings wins.

Kickball is typically played among young, school-age children, both as a playground game and as part of physical education (PE). The lack of both specialized equipment and highly skill-based positions (like the pitcher) makes the game an accessible introduction to related sports such as baseball and softball. In recent decades, it has gained popularity among adults, and today many cities are home to one or more organized kickball leagues for adults.

Kickball was likely invented around 1910 in the United States and began to spread from about the 1920s onward, mainly via PE classes in public schools. It became an especially popular recess sport on playgrounds across the country in the 1970s, and is now played in various forms in countries around the world, such as Canada, England, Japan, South Korea, and South America.

==History==
Kickball, originally called &quot;Kicking Baseball&quot;, was claimed to have been invented as early as 1910 by Dr. Emmett Dunn Angell in his noted book &quot;Play: Comprising Games for the Kindergarten, Playground, Schoolroom and College : How to Coach and Play Girls&#x27; Basket-ball, Etc&quot; (1910). His description and field illustration in this book is both the closest and earliest known precursor to the modern game of kickball. He also notes that &quot;The game seems to afford equal enjoyment to the children, and it gives a better understanding of the national game (Baseball), and at the same time affords them an exercise that is not too violent and is full of fun.&quot;.

A later documented inventor claim, as early as 1917, was by Nicholas C Seuss, Supervisor of Cincinnati Park Playgrounds in Cincinnati, Ohio. Seuss submitted his first documented overview of the game in &quot;The Playground Book,&quot; published in 1917. This description includes 12 rules and a field diagram, and refers to kickball as &quot;Kick Base Ball&quot; and &quot;Kick Baseball&quot;.
In 1920–1921, &quot;Kick Ball&quot; was used by physical education teachers in US public schools to teach young boys and girls the basics of baseball. Around this time, the ball that was used was a soccer ball or volleyball. It was played by ten to 30 players and the field included a &quot;Neutral Zone&quot;: an area not to be entered until the ball has actually been kicked. There was no pitcher, because the ball would be kicked from the home area, which was a 3-foot circle. The ball had to pass beyond the 5-foot line, and base-runners could only advance one base on infield balls. Teams would switch sides only after all team members had kicked.
During this time, kickball was played on the same field as baseball except that there was only one base corresponding to a baseball diamond&#x27;s 2nd base. Multiple players could be on base at a time, but all needed to get home before the last kicker kicked and the kicking order had retired.

There were also two shortstop player positions: one between 1st and 2nd base and the other between 2nd and 3rd. Home plate was marked by a 3 foot by 4 foot rectangle on the ground.

In April 1922, Daniel Chase, Supervisor of Physical Education for the New York State Department of Education, describes the earliest known account of adults playing kickball. This match took place at a conference of rural teachers in Mooers Forks, NY, where Chase was teaching games that the teachers could in turn teach to their pupils. They did not have a ball, so they made one out of an old stocking and some rags; it was about 7 to 8 inches long and tied off with an old shoelace. The construction of this makeshift ball was demonstrated to the rural teachers by Mr. Braddock Wells. The teachers were assigned numbers to create teams; odd numbers on one team and even numbers on the other. The team captains chose college names to represent each team name: the odds chose Yale and the evens chose Princeton. The game of &quot;Kick Baseball&quot; was the last game they played at the conference to decide the championship for the day. Ten players were chosen for each team and the remaining were organized into a cheering section. Yale kicked first. On the field there was no pitcher, but an extra shortstop between 1st and 2nd base. Chase recounts that only three innings were completed in the heat that day, with Yale ending up as the victor winning 3 to 2. Furthermore, the cheering sections showed great sportsmanship, applauding all good plays impartially.

In the 1940s, American World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle reported kickball being played by U.S. soldiers during the Tunisia Campaign of 1942–1943. In addition, &quot;Kick Ball&quot; was promoted as an informal game for soldiers by the United States Department of the Army from as early as 1943. In this more difficult variant of the game, all kicks had to be home runs, by beating the kicked ball back to home after consecutive passes to all basemen before throwing them out at home.

Kickball gained prominence as a very popular recess sport and after-school game on playgrounds across the US in the 1970s.

==Field==
Kickball is typically played on a softball diamond with an 8.5 inch to 16 inch diameter inflated rubber ball, such as a utility ball. As in baseball/softball, the game uses three bases, a pitcher&#x27;s mound, and a home plate. Sometimes in less formal games, the field is not bounded by a fence (which traditionally surrounds a softball or baseball diamond), but is instead open. This may result in informal rule changes to accommodate the field, such as home runs being counted by number of bounces instead of by distance.

Kickball can also be played on a rectangular blacktop area with chalk or paint outlines, such as an open outdoor basketball court.

==Popularity among adults==
While kickball was long mostly considered a child&#x27;s game in the United States and Canada, over time it has gained popularity among adults as a recreational sport. In 1998, the World Adult Kickball Association was founded, and since the late 1990s and early 2000s, many US and Canadian cities have created kickball leagues for adults, while additional governing bodies have also been formed. Some US cities even have multiple such organized adult leagues. Kickball is also offered as an intramural sport on many college campuses.

==Popularity outside the United States==
Kickball is popular among youth in South Korea. Known as &quot;balyagu&quot; [발야구 (foot-baseball)], it is a staple in physical education (PE) classes within elementary schools.

In Japan, kickball is played by elementary-school students and is known as キックベース(Kickbase).

Kickball is a popular game played by elementary-school children in Canada, where it is usually referred to as either &quot;soccer baseball&quot; or &quot;kickball.&quot; In some areas it may also be referred to as &quot;Chinese baseball&quot; or &quot;California kickball.&quot;

In England, the variation often played in PE lessons in schools is referred to as &quot;Football-Rounders,&quot; a mix of association football and rounders.

A related sport, &quot;kickingball,&quot; is popular among Venezuelan refugees in Argentina.

The presence of glomerulations, also known as petechial hemorrhages, in the bladder suggests that the bladder wall has been damaged, irritated, and/or inflamed. Petechial hemorrhages originate from punctuate hemorrhages. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Diagnostic Criteria for IC, developed in 1987, required the presence of glomerulations or Hunner&#x27;s Ulcers for diagnosis of IC and is still used today, to determine eligibility for some clinical trials. However other research has theorized that the hydrodistention procedure used for the diagnosis of IC itself may have created these tiny broken blood vessels. Studies have found glomerulations in asymptomatic populations, suggesting that they are not applicable as a marker for IC. Thus, a diagnosis of IC is now based upon other, less invasive methods, such as the PUF Scale (Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale). Glomerulation has been observed to be one of the feature for prostate cancer. However, efforts to determine whether this is association or causation have concluded that while glomerulations may be a common finding in individuals with prostate cancer, they are not a significant predictor.

== Presentation ==
Glomerulations appear as checkerboard/lattice patterns, splotches, or pinpoint-sized red marks on the bladder. Glomerulations are classified into five grades that take into consideration the type and location of injury: Grade 0 (normal mucosa), Grade I (petechiae in at least two quadrants), Grade II (large submucosal bleeding), Grade III (diffuse global submucosal bleeding), and Grade IV (mucosal disruption, with or without bleeding).

According to NIDDK criteria for inclusion in IC studies, examination for glomerulations is performed following hydrodistention of the bladder. In this procedure, water is instilled into the bladder to a pressure of 80–100 cm for 1–2 minutes. When water is drained from the bladder, glomerulations may appear. To be considered as IC, these submucosal hemorrhages must be present in at least 3 quadrants of the bladder with over 10 glomerulations per quadrant. Glomerulations should not be along the path of cystoscope which may suggest trauma instead.

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiologic mechanism of glomerulations is unknown and debated. Some researchers suggest it may be the bladder&#x27;s response to prolonged periods of underfilling. Another possible mechanism of glomerulation is over expression of angiogenic growth factors in the bladder.

It has been shown that glomerulations are also presented under hydrodistension procedures. During the filling portion of hydrodistension, one can see white fibrous bundles as the bladder is stretched. When stretched, blood flow is interrupted in these fibrous bundles. After this stretching phase, the emptying phase allows blood flow to resume. This is where one can see bleeding from capillaries.

In relation to interstitial cystitis, when noxious stimuli are present, it causes injury to the bladder mucosa resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. Disruption of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer along with the increased presence of mast cells, T cells, and B cells causes the bladder epithelium to become more permeable. Injury to the GAG layer may lead to increased release of adhesion factors that bind to angiogenic molecules, which generally have little presence under normal conditions, to promote wound healing. Ultimately, increased adhesion factors and overproduction of angiogenic factors from mast cells and disruption of the GAG layer results in tissue fibrosis. As mentioned above, the technique of hydrodistention is one method used to diagnose interstitial cystitis, in which the atrophic bladder is filled and emptied and thus, the stretch of the bladder wall is one possible mechanism of glomerulations.

== Risk factors ==
Diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain or discomfort, accompanied with urinary symptoms, seems to be the most likely risk factor for glomerulation. Research has shown that up to 7.5% of the adult female population is associated with chronic pelvic pain (CPP), in which irritative voiding is commonly seen. Bladder tissue damage is a component that could lead to CPP. These symptoms are also seen in IC which may have led to the pathogenesis of glomerulation through hydrodistention.

It is speculated that chronic underfilling of the bladder contributes to glomerulations. For example, glomerulations can be seen after radiation therapy, in individuals undergoing dialysis, and after urinary diversion.

== Relation to interstitial cystitis ==
The identification of glomerulations as diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome is unclear. Interstitial cystitis (IC)/ bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is associated with chronic pelvic pain, pressure and discomfort within the urinary system. In 1987, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) developed diagnostic criteria for IC which included the presence of glomerulations or petechial hemorrhages. The purpose of the NIDDK diagnostic criteria was to facilitate comparable groups for research. It was not intended to set strict criteria for the diagnosis of IC.

Interstitial cystitis may also induce angiogenic factors including VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and PD-ECGF (platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor) resulting in neovascularization. Angiogenic Factors are crucial in vessel development as high values may lead to vessels without enough pericyte coverage. Formation of these newer and weaker vessels in the submucosa associated specifically with IC or BPS, may rupture during hydrodistention causing glomerulation.

In addition to hydrodistension related glomerulations, a study by Rosamilia et al. has shown that biopsied bladders from women with interstitial cystitis have decreased vessel density in the subepithelium. With this, data collected by Irwin et al. also showed that blood perfusion in interstitial cystitis bladders is reduced. Thus, decreased blood perfusion may further increase the expression of angiogenic factors VEGF and PD-ECGF. Alongside with VEGF there is an increase in Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), for HIF-1 binds to VEGF when oxygen is limited in availability.

Many guidelines do not use glomerulations as a diagnostic criteria for BPS/IC. In a 2014 review of systematic literature searches on PubMed, there were no consistent correlation between the grade or severity of glomerulation and BPS/IC. In the ESSIC guideline, glomerulations are only used to further differentiate bladder pain syndrome (BPS) without Hunner&#x27;s ulcers into different categories: BPS Type 1 (without glomerulations) and BPS Type 2 (with glomerulations). The American Urological Association guideline mentions that glomerulations may be detected on cystoscopy, but that it is not specific for BPS/IC. High rates of glomerulations have been observed in other urological conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, upper urinary tract stones, prostatitis, &quot;etc.&quot; which challenges its use as a diagnostic marker.

In fact, signs of interstitial cystitis can expand from glomerulations to Hunner&#x27;s ulcers and fibrosis. Though one should note that many times, the diagnosis of IC in an individual may not be accurate to the time in which the individual already has IC. Therefore, whether glomerulations are observed during the time of a hydrodistension procedure cannot conclude that it is associated with interstitial cystitis.

== Prognosis ==
Glomerulation can be life-threatening when the rate of blood loss is faster than rate of blood transfusion. Severe bleeding can arise due to IC and bladder carcinoma. In severe bladder hemorrhages, prolonged hospitalization may occur. However, glomerulations can occur in both symptomatic Bladder Pain Syndrome and non-symptomatic Bladder Pain Syndrome.

There is no consistent evidence that glomerulations are correlated to severity of urinary symptoms, quality of life, bladder inflammation, or bladder capacity. One study suggests that the severity of glomerulations may change over time as seen in a few individuals who have either worsened or diminished glomerulations in their subsequent evaluations.

==Treatment==
Though there is limited research on the treatment of glomerulation, some researchers found that it is safe to implement transcatheter arterial embolization of the prostatic or vesical arteries to sustainably control bladder hemorrhage. It is a minimally invasive procedure with a 90% success rate and is well-tolerated in most cases. It is proven to improve quality of life.

Since there are not many established treatment available, the best treatment for glomerulation is prevention, ex. ensure adequate hydration to flush out infection, beware of drug-induced bleeding and continuous bladder irrigation. In regards to surgery, it has been mentioned that surgery is often the last resort.

In people with interstitial cystitis, guidelines such as the American Urological Association (AUC) and Canada Urological Association (CUA) do not differentiate treatment strategies between those with and without glomerulations. While fulguration is listed as a third-line treatment option for interstitial cystitis with Hunner&#x27;s Lesions, guidelines do not recommend it to treat glomerulations. Instead, guidelines have set symptom control and quality of life as some of the main goals of treatment for IC. However, there is a lack of consistent evidence that the presence of glomerulations affects treatment outcomes.

In addition to traditional IC therapies, diet modification remains a core self care strategy as foods that are irritating to the bladder dramatically worsen the symptoms that people may experience. Foods high in acid and/or caffeine (such as all coffees, regular teas, green teas, sodas, diet sodas, artificial sweeteners and most fruit juices) should be avoided. The daily goal should be to soothe rather than irritate the bladder wall.

<text>Vincenzo Gemito (July 16, 1852 – March 1, 1929) was an Italian sculptor and artist.

Although he worked in various studios of well-known artists in his native Naples, Rome and Paris, he is considered to have largely been self-taught, the reason he produced such distinctive works for that time, replacing sentiment with outstanding realism. His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==

Gemito was born in Naples to a poor woodcutter&#x27;s family. The day after his birth, his mother left him on the steps of the dell&#x27;Annunziata orphanage and he was taken in to live with the other foundlings. He was given the surname Genito - for &quot;generato&quot; (“born” in Italian), as was common for orphans, but this somehow became Gemito in orphanage records.

On July 30, 1852, he was adopted by a young family that had recently lost a child. The father was an artisan, and as a young child Gemito was probably encouraged to use his hands. He was working as an apprentice in painter and sculptor Emanuele Caggiano&#x27;s studio before he was 10 years old, demonstrating a dexterity and inventiveness which he eventually became famous for. He also worked in Stanislao Lista&#x27;s studio. As a 12-year-old he was enrolled at the Naples Academy of Fine Arts (where he became a lifelong friend of artist Antonio Mancini), and also attended the Domenico Maggiore Academy for night classes.

He moulded the terracotta piece, &quot;The Player&quot;, (&quot;Il Giocatore&quot;), one of his most famous works, when only 16 years old. It created excitement when exhibited at the Promotrice in Naples, so much so that King Victor Emmanuel II purchased it and presented it to the Museo di Capodimonte for permanent display.

Gemito moved to Paris in 1877 where he found a great friend in noted French artist Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier. As he was creating new works in various media in Paris, he also exhibited his works in noted salons and galleries, and at the Universal Exposition of 1878. It was at the Paris Salon the previous year where he experienced a triumph, with the showing of his &quot;Neapolitan Fisherboy&quot;, which he had worked on for some years to perfect. The acclaim surrounding that work brought him widespread fame, and lucrative commissions for portraits. He remained in Paris three years before returning to Naples (1880) after his partner died. He went to Capri for a short time, where he married Anna Cutolo.

In 1883 he once again demonstrated his determination to work outside the norm when he constructed his own foundry on the via Mergellina in Naples. He did so to revive the lost-wax process for bronze casting, which had been used during the Renaissance.

In 1887, Gemito was commissioned to create a marble statue of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, to be erected outside the Royal Palace of Naples. Marble was the least liked medium for Gemito, and he fretted that this work was below his capabilities. He suffered a mental breakdown and withdrew to a one-room apartment, and spent periods in a mental hospital. For the next 21 years he worked on drawing but remained a recluse, and it wasn&#x27;t until 1909 that he resumed sculpting to once again produce masterful works.

In his later years, Gemito turned to gold- and silver-smithing, and his intricate and delicate works are much admired today.

In 1952, a postage stamp was issued in Italy to celebrate the 100 years since Gemito&#x27;s birth.

<text>James Langstaff Bowman, (October 6, 1879 – September 14, 1951) was the first Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from Manitoba.

== Biography ==
Bowman had been a teacher and lawyer in Dauphin, Manitoba. In 1917, he became the town&#x27;s mayor. He ran unsuccessfully in the 1925 and 1926 general elections for the Conservative Party. He finally winning a seat in the 1930 election that brought R.B. Bennett to power.

He became Speaker after his predecessor, George Black, suffered a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1934, and was unfit to preside when the House of Commons of Canada reconvened in January 1935.

As the Deputy Speaker was ill, Bennett approached Bowman, a backbencher, hours before the House was to convene, about becoming Speaker for the rest of the Parliamentary term.

Bowman had little experience as Speaker and had to deal with a tense, pre-election session. Members of Parliament on all sides of the House felt that Bowman did well in the job. But when the 1935 general election was held in the fall, Bowman lost his seat by a large margin.

He returned to his law practice in Dauphin and failed in his attempt to regain his seat in the 1940 election.

James Bowman was named to the team that represented the Manitoba Curling Association at the 1932 Winter Olympics. That year, curling was a demonstration sport. Bowman was third for the team which took first place in the event. The Manitoba team was undefeated, winning all four of its games at the Olympics. In 2004, the team was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Steens Mountain is a large fault-block mountain in the northwest United States, located in Harney County, Oregon. Stretching some north to south, on its west side it rises from the Alvord Desert at an elevation of about to at the summit. Steens Mountain is not part of a mountain range but is properly a single mountain, the largest of Oregon&#x27;s fault-block mountains.

The Steens Mountain Wilderness encompasses of Steens Mountain. of the Wilderness are protected from grazing and free of cattle.

==Geology==
Steens Mountain is the remnant of a long shield volcano.

The east face of Steens Mountain is composed mainly of basalts stacked one upon another. Lava flows several hundreds of feet thick inundated the region between 17 and 14 million years ago. Chemical data from magma deposits from the area reveal three distinct stages of volcanism.

Layers of clay and volcanic dust show over forty lava flows on Steens Mountain. Most lava layers reach to thick or more in some areas. As the surface cracked, peaks and valleys were formed. Erosion and landfalls continue to modify the faces of the cliffs along the mountain. The sediment bedding is roughly horizontal, evidence to the absence of compressional forces. The white sediments consist primarily of stratified acidic tuffs. While rain hasn&#x27;t been a main contributor to erosion, ice and snow melt are the main sources of erosion on Steens Mountain.

==Ecology==
Vegetation in the Steens Mountain Wilderness varies greatly according to elevation. Common plants include sagebrush, juniper, various species of bunchgrass, mountain mahogany, aspen, mountain meadow knotweed, and false hellebore. Other vegetation endemic to Steens Mountain includes Steens paintbrush (&quot;Castilleja pilosa var. steenensis&quot;), moss gentian (&quot;Gentiana fremontii&quot;), Steens Mountain penstemon (&quot;Penstemon davidsonii var. praeteritus&quot;), Steens Mountain thistle (&quot;Cirsium peckii&quot;), a dwarf blue lupine, and Cusick&#x27;s buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum cusickii&quot;).
Steens Mountain is distinctive in its absence of conifers, especially Ponderosa Pine and Douglas Fir, at elevations in which they would normally be found – from above sea level. Although other mountains of the Great Basin also lack conifers, Steens Mountain is the largest mountain area without conifers. One possible cause of the absence of conifers is the isolation of Steens Mountain, although lack of seed dispersal by bird species such as Clark&#x27;s Nutcracker may also be a factor. It is also possible that prehistoric fires, including fires used by Native Americans, eradicated the conifer population. Home to a wide variety of animals, the area is primarily known for birding, hunting, and fishing. Birds here include Golden eagles, owls, and the protected sage grouse. Other animals found in the area include rattlesnakes, scorpions, elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, and cougars. The area is home to wild horses. Drawing much controversy, the Bureau of Land Management engages in wild horse roundups every few years, employing helicopters to herd the horses. Historically, Steens Mountain Wilderness was once home to grizzly bears; a skull was unearthed in nearby Malheur Lake. In the 1970s, a wolverine was trapped and released on Steens Mountain.

==History==
The mountain was called the &quot;Snowy Mountains&quot; by John Work, one of the fur traders who were the first Europeans in the area. It was renamed in 1860 for United States Army Major Enoch Steen, who fought and drove members of the Paiute tribe off the mountain. American Indians used the Steens Mountain, particularly Big Indian Gorge.
On October 24, 2000, President Bill Clinton approved the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protective Act. The act was created by local landowners in cooperation with local and national government representatives in response to a proposed National Monument. This act created the Steens Mountain BLM Cooperative Management and Protection Area, a area. This law protects from mining, and from cattle grazing.

==Climate==
==Recreation==
The west slope of Steens Mountain is traversed by a loop road, which is suitable for passenger vehicles. The road reaches an elevation of , making it the highest road in Oregon. It is possible to drive nearly to the summit of the mountain and to other viewpoints such as Kiger Gorge. Steens Mountain is also host to Steens Mountain High Altitude Running Camp.

Other recreational activities enjoyed on and around Steens Mountain are camping, picknicking, bicycling, hiking, hunting, sightseeing, soaring, and exploring. There are numerous hot springs along the base of Steens Mountain, including Alvord Hot Springs. Far from city lights, stargazing is also popular.

<text>Patrick Vincent McNamara (October 4, 1894 – April 30, 1966) was an American politician. A Democrat, he served as a United States Senator from Michigan from 1955 until his death from a stroke in Bethesda, Maryland in 1966.

==Early life and career==
Patrick McNamara was born in North Weymouth, Massachusetts, to Patrick Vincent and Mary Jane (née Thynne) McNamara, who were Irish immigrants. The oldest of eight children, he received his early education at public schools in his native town. He attended the local high school for two and a half years before transferring to the Fore River Apprentice School in Quincy, where he learned the trade of pipe fitting. In 1916, he began working as pipe fitter and foreman at the Fore River Shipyard. He then played semi-professional football from 1919 to 1920.

McNamara moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he worked as foreman of a construction crew for the Grinnell Company. He then married Kathleen Kennedy, with whom he had two children. Mary Jane (1922) and Patrick (1925). His wife died in 1929. He then married Mary Mattee in 1930. He then served as job superintendent for R.L. Spitzley Company (1922–1926) and general superintendent of H. Kelly Company (1926–1930). From 1930 to 1932, he took extension courses at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He was maintenance foreman at a Chrysler plant (1931–1934) before joining the Donald Miller Company. In 1937, he became president of Pipe Fitters Local 636, a position he held until 1955. He also served as vice-president of the Detroit chapter of the American Federation of Labor from 1939 to 1945.

During World War II, he served as rent director of the Office of Price Administration in Detroit from 1942 to 1945. He then joined the Stanley-Carter Company, where he served as superintendent of construction, customer contact man, head of labor relations, and vice-president.

In 1946, McNamara made his first venture into politics with a successful campaign for an unexpired term on the Detroit City Council. He won twenty-one of the city&#x27;s twenty-three wards, and served until 1947. From 1949 to 1955, he was a member of the Detroit Board of Education.

==U.S. Senate==

In 1954, McNamara challenged former Senator Blair Moody for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the United States Senate. He was given little chance of defeating Moody by most political analysts, but won the nomination after Moody died two weeks before the primary election. He faced two-term Republican incumbent Homer S. Ferguson in the general election, during which McNamara criticized President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s economic, labor, and farm policies. In November, he narrowly defeated Ferguson by a margin of 51%-49%.

McNamara was reelected over Alvin Morell Bentley in 1960, serving from January 3, 1955, until his death in Bethesda, Maryland. In the Eighty-seventh Congress, he became the first chairman of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging. He also chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on Public Works in the Eighty-eighth and Eighty-ninth Congresses. The 1959 committee hearings which Pat McNamara called on the subject of the health of the elderly began a public debate which led to the creation of Medicare.

McNamara died of a stroke at Bethesda Naval Hospital on April 30, 1966, aged 71, and was interred in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Detroit.

McNamara was a member of Americans for Democratic Action. The Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building in Detroit was named for him.

==Legacy==
McNamara donated his archival papers to the Walter P. Reuther Library, where they are open to the public for research. The bulk of materials relate to his time in the Senate and his work on the Public Works Committee (chairman, 1963–66), Labor and Public Welfare Committee, Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, Select Subcommittee on Poverty, and the Special Committee on Aging. Subjects covered include problems of the aged, civil rights, atomic energy, education, taxes, public works, federal highway acts, and labor. Correspondents include all major political figures of the period and many labor leaders.

<text>Icos Corporation (trademark ICOS) was an American biotechnology company and the largest biotechnology company in the U.S. state of Washington, before it was sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 2007. It was founded in 1989 by David Blech, Isaac Blech, Robert Nowinski, and George Rathmann, a pioneer in the industry and chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of Amgen. Icos focused on the development of drugs to treat inflammatory disorders. During its 17-year history, the company conducted clinical trials of twelve drugs, three of which reached the last phase of clinical trials. Icos also manufactured antibodies for other biotechnology companies.

Icos is best known for the development of tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was discovered by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly. Boosted by a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phase III clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos&#x27;s workers were laid off soon after. CMC Biologics, a Danish contract manufacturer, bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees.

Icos was founded in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had previously started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed with the goal of developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name &quot;Icos&quot; comes from &quot;icosahedron&quot;, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33 million in July 1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates – who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September 1990. Icos went public on June 6, 1991, raising $36 million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February 2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.

===Cialis===
Sold as Cialis and initially codenamed IC351, tadalafil is a drug prescribed for erectile dysfunction (ED) and approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, similar in function to sildenafil. In addition to ED and PAH, tadalafil has undergone clinical trials for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and for female sexual dysfunction.

Tadalafil was initially formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) under a new drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August 1991. The drug was originally researched as a treatment for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company&#x27;s 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo&#x27;s core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April 2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November 2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June 2007 and in the United States in January 2008.

In 2006, Cialis generated $971 million in sales, leading Icos to post its first-ever quarterly profit in August. In May 2009, tadalafil, to be sold as Adcirca by United Therapeutics, was approved in the United States for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension based on data from a pivotal study begun before the sale of Icos to Eli Lilly.

====Lawsuits with Pfizer====
Pfizer and Lilly Icos have filed many lawsuits against each other in various countries over Cialis and Viagra. Pfizer was given a broad patent on PDE5 inhibitors in Britain in 1993. Lilly Icos filed a complaint in a London court in September 1999, and the patent was overturned in November 2000 on the grounds that Pfizer&#x27;s patent was based on information already in the public domain when the patent was issued. In the United States, Pfizer filed suit against Lilly Icos soon after receiving a broad US patent for PDE5 inhibitors in October 2002. The United States Patent and Trademark Office ordered a reexamination of the patent, and, as in Britain, the examiner found that PDE5 inhibitors were not a new invention by Pfizer, voiding the patent. In Canada, Pfizer moved to block sales of Cialis five months after it was approved there, arguing that there could be consumer backlash against Pfizer should Cialis be pulled from the market months later as a result of an ongoing patent lawsuit. A federal judge refused, saying he could not &quot;imagine demonstrations in the street or storming of the barricades because one impotence medicine is made unavailable&quot;.

====Blindness warning on label====
In May 2005, the FDA began investigating reports of sudden blindness in users of sildenafil (Viagra). The FDA said it had received reports of the condition, a permanent blindness in one eye known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, in 38 users of sildenafil and 5 users of tadalafil or vardenafil (Levitra). Lilly Icos voluntarily amended the Cialis label to warn of the condition. The FDA was criticized for its handling of the matter, as an FDA safety officer had commented on unusual reports of blindness over 13 months before a journal article was published on the issue. United States Senator Chuck Grassley wrote a letter to the FDA detailing his criticism, saying that the FDA&#x27;s Office of New Drugs (OND) had taken no action &quot;despite OND&#x27;s knowledge of the blindness risks since January 2004 and general agreement among FDA staff last spring that the label should be updated&quot;. Grassley&#x27;s letter also suggested that Pfizer resisted adding the blindness warning to Viagra&#x27;s label. In July 2005, the FDA said that Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis labels would all carry warnings on the risk of sudden blindness, though it was unclear whether the drugs were actually causing the blindness.

====Marketing====

Lilly Icos hired the Grey Worldwide Agency in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, to run the Cialis advertising campaign. Cialis advertisements were described as being gentler, warmer and with a more relaxed feel than those of its rivals, to reflect the longer duration of the drug. (Tadalafil has a half-life of 17.5 hours, compared to 3.5 for sildenafil and 4.5 for vardenafil.) Iconic themes in Cialis advertisements include couples in bathtubs and the slogan &quot;When the moment is right, will you be ready?&quot; Cialis advertisements were unique among those of ED drugs in that they went beyond describing ED and mentioning the drug&#x27;s benefits. As a result, Cialis advertisements were also the first to describe side effects, as the FDA requires advertisements in support of a specific brand name to mention side effects; ads for Levitra and Viagra did not mention the brand name of the drug, therefore circumventing this FDA requirement. One of the first advertisements for Cialis aired during the 2004 Super Bowl; Lilly Icos paid more than $4 million for the one-minute ad. Just weeks before the game, the FDA required more possible side effects, including priapism, to be listed in the advertisement. Although many parents objected to the ad being aired during the Super Bowl, Janet Jackson&#x27;s halftime &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; overshadowed Cialis. In January 2006, a physician was added to the advertisements to describe side effects on-screen, and Icos began running advertisements only where more than 90 percent of the audience was made up of adults, effectively ending Super Bowl advertisements. In 2004, Lilly Icos, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline spent a combined $373.1 million to advertise Cialis, Viagra, and Levitra respectively.

===Miscellaneous drugs===
Icos developed several drugs whose purpose was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on the underlying causes of inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

====LeukArrest====
Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest and also known as Hu23F2G, was developed to treat patients with hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells to the site of inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June 1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August 1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April 2000 when interim data from phase III clinical trials did not meet Icos&#x27;s goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28 days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.

====Pafase ====
Pafase, also known as rPAF-AH, was developed to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of &quot;platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase&quot; (PAF-AH, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that plays a role in the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28 days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phase II trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28 days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December 2002 when interim data from phase III trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.

====Sitaxentan sodium and TBC3711====
In June 2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology formed a 50/50 partnership to research endothelin receptor antagonists for use in the areas of pulmonary hypertension and chronic heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled &quot;sitaxsentan&quot;) and TBC3711, were tested in clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, and TBC3711 was designed to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. In April 2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4 million at closing and another $6 million within 18 months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under the brand name Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.

====Other drugs tested in clinical trials====
Icos tested many other drugs that were not approved. They are:
* ICM3, an antibody blocking ICAM-3, designed to treat psoriasis.
* IC14, an antibody blocking CD14, designed to treat sepsis.
* IC747 and IC776, two LFA-1 antagonists, designed to treat psoriasis.
* Resiniferatoxin (RTX), a naturally occurring capsaicin analog, designed to treat interstitial cystitis.
* IC485, a PDE4 inhibitor, designed to treat emphysema, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
* IC83, a CHK-1 inhibitor, designed to enhance chemotherapy.

===Manufacturing===
Icos manufactured many antibodies for various companies. In August 2001, the company partnered with Seattle Genetics to manufacture a component of their top experimental antibody drug SGN-15. In November 2001, Icos signed a production agreement with GPC Biotech to manufacture a class of GPC&#x27;s antibodies that targeted B-cell lymphomas. In January 2002, Icos signed an agreement with Eos Biotechnology, under which Icos would produce Eos&#x27;s most promising monoclonal antibody candidate, and Eos would have non-exclusive rights to Icos&#x27;s CHEF1 enhanced mammalian protein production technology. Eos&#x27;s antibody inhibited angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and was being researched as a treatment for solid tumors. In October 2003, Icos partnered with Protein Design Labs to manufacture their M200 antibody.

==Acquisition by Eli Lilly==

After Icos&#x27;s experimental drugs failed in clinical trials, Eli Lilly was in a prime position to purchase the company. In October 2006, Eli Lilly announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 a share. After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders as well as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) suggesting the deal should be rejected, Lilly increased its offer to $2.3 billion or $34 per share, a 6% increase. Again, resistance was voiced by some large shareholders, and ISS advised shareholders against accepting the new offer, which it still deemed insufficient. On January 25, 2007, at a special meeting, 77% of the shareholders voted in support of the acquisition. Eli Lilly closed the transaction to acquire Icos for $2.3 billion on January 29, 2007.

As a result of the acquisition, Eli Lilly gained complete ownership of Cialis, and promptly shut down Icos operations and laid off Icos personnel, except for 127 employees working at the biologics facility. Icos was the largest biotechnology company in the state of Washington at the time of the acquisition, and employed around 700 people. In December 2007, CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S, a Copenhagen-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell biologics facility and retained the existing 127 employees.

===Controversy===
In addition to the layoff of Icos employees, other aspects of the acquisition were equally controversial, such as assertions that Icos was being sold too cheaply and that conflicts of interest existed. The latter related to Icos senior executives, who – despite poor stock performance, in part from failed clinical development programs and an inability to successfully license drugs over the preceding years – were to be massively compensated upon a successful acquisition.

Senior executives at Icos received cash payments worth a combined $67.8 million for selling the company to Eli Lilly. Icos chairman, chief executive, and president Paul Clark received &quot;a &#x27;golden parachute&#x27; worth $23.2 million in severance pay, cashed-out stock options, restricted stock awards and other bonuses for retention and closing the deal.&quot; Nine senior Icos executives received similar packages, each worth more than $1 million.

<doc id="882645" wikidata="Q2739513" url="?curid=882645" title="Dead Man's Party (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; is the second episode of the third season of the television show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It was written by Marti Noxon, directed by James Whitmore, Jr., and first broadcast on The WB on October 6, 1998.

Buffy struggles with life back in Sunnydale. Her problems with Angel, combined with the anger and distance of her friends and mother, only make things more difficult. However, everyone is eventually brought back together when a Nigerian mask that Joyce has acquired causes an army of zombies to rise up all over Sunnydale.

== Plot ==
Joyce hangs up a Nigerian mask given by a gallery friend. At Giles&#x27; apartment, Buffy avoids most questions about her summer, while Giles hides his relief at her return.

The next day, Joyce takes Buffy to see Principal Snyder, who takes vindictive pleasure in refusing to lift her expulsion. Buffy meets the annoying Pat, a member of Joyce&#x27;s book club, who comments on Buffy&#x27;s recent behavior and its impact on Joyce. Buffy finds a dead cat in the basement and buries it in the garden. That night, the Nigerian mask&#x27;s eyes glow red and the reanimated cat crawls out of the earth.

The return of the cat shocks Buffy and Joyce; Giles arrives to collect it for study. He notices the mask before having to remind Buffy that she is not allowed on school grounds. At school, Buffy&#x27;s friends decide to throw her a party. The discussion distracts Giles from a page showing the Nigerian mask.

Overwhelmed by the noisy party, Buffy tries in vain to talk to Willow. She overhears Joyce telling Pat how tough Buffy&#x27;s return has been on her. Combined with the coldness of her friends and the problems with school, Buffy decides it was a mistake to have come home and starts packing.

At the library, Giles is horrified by what he learns about the mask. He tries to call Buffy, but party-goers fail to relay the message. Driving to Buffy&#x27;s house, Giles hits a man in the road, gets out of the car and finds the man to be a reanimated zombie. Giles barely escapes as bodies rise all over Sunnydale and are inexorably drawn to Joyce&#x27;s mask.

Willow finds Buffy packing to leave and starts berating her for all the pain and worry she caused, explaining that she and the rest of the Scoobies had tough things to deal with as well. Buffy and Joyce argue in the midst of the party, and Xander sides with Joyce against Buffy, while Oz tries to break it up. As the argument grows heated, the revenants crash through the windows and doors, causing the Scoobies — even Joyce, who grabs a weapon — to quit arguing and band together to combat the threat. Several guests are killed. In the bedroom, Willow checks Pat&#x27;s pulse and finds she is dead.

Giles tells Oz and Cordelia about the mask containing the powers of the zombie demon Ovu Mobani, which means &quot;Evil Eye&quot;. Pat reanimates as a zombie and puts the mask on and becomes the demon incarnate. Buffy plunges a garden fork into Pat&#x27;s eyes, causing her to vanish along with all the other zombies. The anger that Joyce and the other Scoobies felt towards Buffy dissipates.

The next day, Giles tries to convince Snyder to let Buffy return. When he refuses, Giles applies a little intimidation. In the coffee shop, Willow tells Buffy about her experiences dabbling in witchcraft. Buffy apologizes for not being there to support her, and Willow forgives her.

==Themes==
Essayist Emily (last name not given) of the site InsectReflection.com discusses friendship, friendship done wrongly, and blame. First, she singles out &quot;Anthony Steward Head&#x27;s microexpressions. He cements his status as one of the show&#x27;s truly elite actors as he is able to convey such depth of emotion with no words,&quot; then adds that he is the only sympathetic and sympathizing character here. &quot;The central purpose of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;,&quot; she writes, &quot;is to bring the main cast back together and tie up any emotional loose threads from the previous season.&quot;

She concludes, wryly, that &quot;it is difficult to sympathise with the Scoobies&#x27; point of view when the episode itself has no interest in it.&quot;

==Reception==
Rhonda Wilcox and David Lavery described &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;, in which Buffy attempts to reconnect with her mother and friends, as &quot;one of the most uncomfortable episodes of the series&quot;. They wrote that the zombies represent the group&#x27;s &quot;failed attempts to bury their anger&quot; at Buffy, and that they only achieve a partial catharsis by fighting alongside her. They quote Xander who says &quot;you can&#x27;t just bury stuff, Buffy, it will come right back to get you&quot;.

&quot;Vox&quot; ranked it at #47 of all 144 episodes on their &quot;Every Episode Ranked From Worst to Best&quot; list, writing, &quot;It always hurts when the Scoobies fight, but it’s also always fantastic television: The characters are so well-defined that you can see each point of view clearly, and you get why each character firmly believes themselves to be correct.&quot; Similarly, Myles McNutt writes that it is &quot;the sort of episode which is meant to be unpleasant, as characters hide their emotions from one another and it leads to a charged confrontation at episode’s end. I like the darkness inherent to this concept, as it places Buffy’s friends as the antagonists as she struggles to return to life in Sunnydale, but I would have much rather not been dealing with a silly Nigerian Zombie mask at the same time.&quot;

Reviewer Billie Doux gives a rating of 3 out of 4 stakes and points out, &quot;The zombies and the Ovu Mobani Evil Eye demon/mask thing are a transparent metaphor for Buffy&#x27;s situation that is even pointed out by Xander. Buried stuff is coming up, and masks hide what we feel.&quot; Roger Pocock writes, &quot;As is so often the case with &quot;Buffy&quot;, the fantasy element is by far the least interesting aspect of the episode. A zombie attack is nothing new... But it’s the emotional conflict that is the really interesting aspect of the episode.&quot;

Mike Loschiavo suggests that the episode is rather slow, like its zombies, but beneficially: &quot;While the show has been busy investigating real life teen troubles (and branching out into social woes this season), we needed an episode that showed us an oft-overlooked issue: consequences.&quot;

==Notes==
:1.Giles: &quot;Buffy Summers is a minor, and is entitled to a public education. Your personal dislike of the girl does not legally entitle you to—&quot; Snyder: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you take it up with the City Council?&quot; Giles: &quot;I thought I&#x27;d start with the State Supreme Court. You&#x27;re powerful in local circles, but I believe I can make life very difficult for you, professionally speaking. And Buffy &quot;will&quot; be allowed back in.&quot; Snyder: &quot;Sorry. I&#x27;m not convinced.&quot; [&quot;Giles shoves him back into his filing cabinet&quot;.] &quot;Would you like me to convince you?&quot;

<text>South Brisbane railway station is a heritage-listed railway station at 133 Grey Street, South Brisbane, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is one of two stations serving the South Brisbane area, the other being South Bank. It was built from 1891 to 1918, making it the second oldest railway station in central Brisbane. It is also known as Cultural Centre Station, Melbourne Street Station, and South Brisbane (Interstate) Station. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.

==Services==
South Brisbane station is served by Beenleigh, Cleveland and Gold Coast railway lines.

==Services by platform==
==Transport links==
Adjacent to the station lies the Cultural Centre busway station that is served by Transport for Brisbane bus services.

==Adjacent attractions==
The station is very convenient to the Queensland Cultural Centre, including the Queensland Museum, the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, and the State Library.

The station is also very conveniently located to the Queensland Conservatorium and Suncorp Piazza, which are both situated within the South Bank Parklands.

==History==

The first station was constructed in 1884 on the corner of Melbourne and Grey Streets and opened as Melbourne Street railway station.

The second and current building was constructed on higher ground in 1891 as the terminus for the new rail extension from Boggo Junction (now Dutton Park railway station). This line bypassed the Woolloongabba railyards and made redundant the Stanley Street railway station that existed from 1882 to 1884. The £77,585 contract was let to Murphy &amp; Company on 2 April 1890, and the line was completed by them on 7 December 1891.

A £5,658 contract for erecting the new passenger station, to be known as South Brisbane railway station, was let to Henry Pears on 22 June 1891. It was the second masonry station to be erected in Brisbane after Roma Street railway station (opening 1875) and pre-dating Central railway station (opening in 1901) by a decade.

Passenger services commenced on 21 December 1891, although the station building had not been completed. For this reason there was no accompanying opening ceremony. When the building opened shortly afterwards it included a temperance refreshment room, and served commuters on the South Coast, Cleveland and Beaudesert lines.

South Brisbane station was intended as a temporary terminus, pending an extension of the line across the river, so only two platforms were constructed. However, after the 1893 flood washed away the Albert Bridge over the Brisbane River at Indooroopilly, the South Brisbane station served as the principal terminus for all southern and western rail services for the next two and a half years.

The Victoria Bridge was also partially washed away, together with telephone wires to the north side of the river. South Brisbane Railway Station was one of only five or six places that remained connected with the north side by telephone. In the adjoining Melbourne-street post and telegraph office the water rose to a height of on the upper floor. The Railway Commissioners granted PMG the use of a suitable room in the South Brisbane Railway Station until repairs were carried out.

A 1912–1913 proposal to expand South Brisbane station to a six platform station reflected the increasing importance of the southern rail network, both as a passenger service and as a goods line. This work was undertaken between 1914 and 1918. To handle the increased traffic a turntable was constructed in 1916, which was expanded to in 1925. This was removed with the change-over to diesel engines in 1968.

In September 1930, the Southern Brisbane Interstate station opened to the west of the existing station on the site of the present Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, when the standard gauge New South Wales North Coast line was extended from Kyogle. It was the terminus for the &quot;Brisbane Limited&quot;.

On 18 November 1978, the narrow-gauge line was extended, via the Merivale Bridge from South Brisbane station into Roma Street station on the opposite side of the Brisbane River. As the interstate station at South Brisbane was to be demolished to make way for the World Expo 88 site, the standard gauge services were extended to the Brisbane Transit Centre, an extension of Roma Street station, on 21 June 1986, making the Transit Centre the interstate terminal.

Since two of the island platforms at South Brisbane were removed to accommodate the cross-river line, the South Brisbane station was reduced to its two original two platforms. However, in 1995, as part of the construction of the Gold Coast line, the standard gauge line was converted to dual gauge and Platform 3 which had been out of use since November 1978, was recommissioned.

From 31 October 2011, the station was closed for seven weeks for major structural works and raising the platforms. Trains still travelled through South Brisbane during that period but did not stop.

== Description ==
The station is a long, two-storeyed brick building with a hipped corrugated-iron roof. The Grey Street frontage is dominated by a central projecting pedimented entrance. Either side of the entrance are sloping corrugated-iron street awnings, which are supported by cast-iron columns with Corinthian capitals and large brackets.
Other Renaissance stylistic elements to the street facade include: Romanesque windows on the upper floor, rendered string courses and window mouldings, pilasters with Corinthian capitals, and a solid rendered parapet.

A former garden park in front of the Grey Street entrance is now a car park/loading bay.

At the rear of the station building are the platforms, which were constructed level with the upper floor of the main building, in anticipation of the river extension. The awning to No 1 platform retains a tank roof on a steel frame, with cast-iron columns and brackets and a decorative timber frieze (1891). No 2 platform has a cantilevered butterfly roof (bullnosed until recent re-roofing), which is supported by lattice iron girders (.

On both platforms the furniture consists of a considerable number of early cast-iron framed seats which incorporate the QR logo. Many of these were collected from other Brisbane metropolitan stations for the Expo &#x27;88 refurbishment, and have remained.

As preparation for Expo &#x27;88 the external brickwork and cast iron was restored, the roof was replaced, and all the exterior brickwork except for the upper level front facade was painted an uncharacteristic pink or peach. Interior renovations included false ceilings, a new staircase for office staff, and repainting.

The main building at the South Brisbane Railway Station remains substantially intact, despite interior alteration, but the turntable, two island platforms, and the front park and garden have been removed.

== Heritage listing ==
South Brisbane Railway Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland&#x27;s history.

The South Brisbane Railway Station, erected in 1891, is significant historically as a reflection of the importance of South Brisbane as a commercial centre in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and as a major terminal in the southeast Queensland regional rail network until 1986.

==Episodes==

==Production==
&quot;Roswell High&quot; was originally developed by 20th Century Fox Television and Regency Television for the Fox Network, but it eventually landed on The WB (retitled simply to &quot;Roswell&quot;) thanks to the latter network&#x27;s offer to extend a full 22-episode upfront commitment. The pilot episode was filmed in 12 days with a budget of $2,000,000. &quot;The Morning After,&quot; the second episode of the series, was the first episode with the full title sequence utilizing the theme song, &quot;Here With Me&quot; by Dido.

==Filming locations==
&quot;Roswell&quot; was filmed in various locations around California. City Hall, Charter Oak High School, and several other businesses and residences in Covina served as stand ins for fictional locations in Roswell, New Mexico, as well as Vasquez Rocks, a park in Los Angeles County. Episode 1 of season 3 was filmed partially in Salina, Utah.

==Airing history==
The series premiered on October 6, 1999, on The WB in the United States to generally favorable reviews, and quickly gained an outspoken fanbase.

In response to low ratings during the first season, the relationship-driven stand-alone episodes of the early first season were to be replaced with more science fiction themes and multi-episode plot arcs. Starting with the second season, after a fierce fan-driven campaign involving bottles of Tabasco sauce—a favorite condiment of the show&#x27;s alien characters—were sent to the network&#x27;s offices, veteran science fiction writer Ronald D. Moore was brought in as an executive producer and showrunner to further develop the science fiction elements of the show.

Not all fans responded favorably to the shift to more science fiction-driven storylines during the second season and the ratings continued to disappoint, causing the network to finally cancel the show on May 15, 2001, after the show&#x27;s second-season finale. However, producing studio 20th Century Fox persuaded UPN to commit to a third season as a package deal when UPN outbid The WB for one of its popular flagship series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. During the 2001 – 2002 television season, &quot;Roswell&quot;, in its third season, aired directly after &quot;Buffy&quot; on Tuesday nights on UPN, though it was unable to hold on to the audience &quot;Buffy&quot; provided. This led to the show&#x27;s final cancellation.

==Ratings==

==Plot==
===Season one===
In the first season of Roswell, (premiering October 1999 on The WB) we meet high school students and best friends Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby), Maria DeLuca (Majandra Delfino), and Alex Whitman (Colin Hanks), residents of the small town of Roswell, New Mexico, site of the famed Roswell Incident. Liz Parker&#x27;s parents own the Crashdown Café, which serves alien-themed dishes. At the beginning of the pilot episode, Liz is waitressing in her parents&#x27; restaurant when a disagreement between two customers breaks out. A gun is fired, and Liz is shot. We are introduced to a character named Max Evans (Jason Behr), a seemingly normal high school student, who rushes to Liz&#x27;s aid and saves her life by healing the gunshot wound with his alien abilities. The healing leaves a silver hand print on her stomach. To hide what he has done, Max pours ketchup on Liz before fleeing the scene with his friend Michael Guerin (Brendan Fehr). The shooting acts as a catalyst for the rest of the series action.

Liz is presented as an insatiably curious character, obtaining a sample of Max&#x27;s saliva, analyzing it, and finding that his cells do not look like normal human cells. When she confronts him, Max admits that he, his sister Isabel (Katherine Heigl) and their friend Michael, are aliens from the planet Antar, whose spaceship crashed at Roswell in 1947. A love triangle begins between Max, Liz, and Kyle Valenti (Nick Wechsler), the sheriff&#x27;s son whom Liz was dating.

Max divulging the secret of his heritage to Liz and the series of revelations as other characters, first Maria and then Alex, give the first season of Roswell much of its narrative tension, secrecy and trust being important to character development, relationships, and plot. Fear of authority is another theme of the series, as the teenagers protect the secret from characters who are in positions of authority: Roswell&#x27;s sheriff, Jim Valenti (William Sadler), and a series of FBI agents.

Two romances develop between human and alien characters. Liz and Max&#x27;s romance is portrayed as tender and sweet, while Michael and Maria&#x27;s is portrayed as passionate and often explosive. Later in the first season a tentative romance develops between Isabel and Alex.

Toward the end of the season another alien character is introduced. Nasedo is a shape shifter, with a violent, murderous past. The gang initially believes that new kid in town Tess Harding (Emilie de Ravin) is Nasedo because she seems to have a strange effect on Max, but this character turns out to be a teenage alien raised by Nasedo.

As the show&#x27;s first season conculdes, it is revealed that Max, Isabel, Michael and Tess are clones of the &quot;Royal Four&quot; of Antar, the planet these characters come from. In a former life, Max was the king of his planet, Isabel his sister and a princess, Michael his second in command and Tess his wife and the queen. The four learn they are alien-human hybrids: their alien DNA was mixed with human DNA in order to allow them to look like humans and survive on earth. Their mission is to one day return to Antar and reclaim the throne from Kivar, Max&#x27;s enemy in his previous life. As a result of this revelation, Liz distances herself from Max because she believes she cannot get in the way of Max&#x27;s destiny.

===Season two===
Much of Roswell&#x27;s second season (commencing October 2000 on The WB) concerns the &#x27;will they/won&#x27;t they&#x27; love story between Max and Liz, now that Liz knows Max has an ancient destiny to be with Tess. While Max reassures Liz of his love for her, and while Tess feels ostracised from the teenage gang of friends, a new upset to this romance arrives in the form of &quot;Future Max.&quot; A version of Max from a future timeline has used time travel to return to a point where he can refocus Max away from his crush on Liz and back to his destined relationship with Tess, to save all the characters from a dark future. Liz steps aside but maintains hope that she and Max will one day be together.

The second season introduces the Skins, another alien race from Antar who have been searching for the alien hybrids since they hatched. Their mission is to locate and turn them over to Kivar, who is now king of Antar. It is revealed that Liz&#x27;s new boss, Congresswoman Whitaker (Gretchen Egolf), is a Skin and her brother Nicholas is the leader of the Skins. Along with renegade Skin Courtney (Sara Downing), a Crashdown Café waitress, who believes Michael, not Max, should have been in charge of Antar, the group travels to Congresswoman Whitaker&#x27;s home town to discover it is inhabited entirely by Skins who are ready for the &quot;Harvest&quot;. Skins unlike &quot;The Royal Four&quot; do not contain a mix of alien and human DNA. In order to survive Earth&#x27;s climate they create husks (fake bodies) which last around 50 years. Skins are so called because once their husks start to reach the end of their shelf lives, they shed their skin.

Tess&#x27;s shape-shifting father Nasedo is killed by Congresswoman Whitaker, and Tess moves in with Sheriff Valenti and his son Kyle. The Roswell aliens destroy the Harvest and find out more about their past. Isabel is disturbed that on their home planet she was named Vilandra and was in love with Kivar, Max&#x27;s enemy and rival, and betrayed her family in favor of Kivar. They also discover a second set of alien clones of the Royal Four were created, landing on Earth in New York City, exact copies of Michael, Max, Isabel and Tess, named Rath (Michael&#x27;s clone), Zan (Max&#x27;s clone), Lonnie (Isabel&#x27;s clone), and Ava (Tess&#x27;s clone). These clones have killed their Max/Zan and come to Roswell to convince Max to join them at a summit meeting of the families of the five warring planets. 

Nicholas returns as a voice for Kivar, and it is revealed the owner of the UFO museum, Brody Davis (Desmond Askew), was used by an alien many times to communicate on Earth, acting as a puppet, explaining why he believes he was abducted by aliens although he has no memories of the incident. Max and Tess go with Isabel and Michael&#x27;s clones to New York, where they are told they can return to their home planet if they give Kivar the Granilith (the rock which came with the Royal Four when they landed on Earth), but remembering advice from Liz, Max turns down Kivar&#x27;s deal. Lonnie strikes a deal Nicholas exchanging Max&#x27;s life for her own return to Antar, but her assassination attempt fails, and Rath and Lonnie &quot;disappear&quot;. Tess&#x27;s clone Ava is haunted by the death of her Zan/Max and remains in Roswell, revealing that since Max healed her she is no longer evil, and her character never reappears despite apparently living in the same town as Tess. 

When Alex returns from a trip to Sweden, he finally makes a romantic connection but he dies tragically in a car accident. Liz is suspicious of the police ruling Alex&#x27;s death a suicide and conducts her own investigation, uncovering evidence he may have been murdered. Liz&#x27;s suspicions point to one of the aliens killing Alex, and she discovers that instead of Alex having been in Sweden, he had actually been in hiding while working on the translation of the Destiny book. 

Angry at Liz&#x27;s investigations of the aliens, Max sleeps with Tess who falls pregnant. Tess says alien pregnancies last a month and that the baby will not survive on Earth, and for the sake of the baby Max, Michael, Isabel and Tess prepare to travel to their home planet. As they say goodbyes to their human friends, Michael and Maria make love for the first time and Max and Liz make a last-ditch effort to find Alex&#x27;s killer. Liz discovers that Tess is the villain, having brainwashed Alex to translate the Destiny book and is responsible for his death. It is revealed Nasedo made a deal with Kivar: Tess can return home safely as long as she&#x27;s carrying Max&#x27;s child, but she must turn over Max, Isabel, and Michael to Kivar. Max lets Tess go and the gang watches as Tess leaves Earth via the Granilith. Maria realizes Michael stayed for her. Max tells Liz he loves her and now must save his son.

===Season three===
After being cancelled by The WB, Roswell returned for a third season on UPN with a storyline around Max&#x27;s quest to save his son which doesn&#x27;t get off to a good start when he and Liz are arrested in Utah after holding up a convenience store. They both end up getting out of jail, but their actions have serious consequences for the rest of the season. Liz&#x27;s father sends Liz to a boarding school in Vermont. Max continues his hunt for an alien ship and the diamond key to the spaceship, his search taking him to Los Angeles where a shape-shifting alien is working as a film producer. Max tries out acting and auditions for a role in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. The fifth alien is, in fact Max&#x27;s protector and they discover the location of an alien ship at a military base. They attempt to fly it, but the ship is too damaged from the crash in 1947. Max leaves L.A. disappointed, and he feels as though he has let down his son.

Isabel is being haunted by Alex&#x27;s ghost, and begins a relationship with Jesse Ramirez, an attorney several years older than her and who works with Isabel and Max&#x27;s adoptive human father. As the season unfolds, their father is diving deeper into the past of his children, not happy with Max&#x27;s criminal behaviour. Isabel marries Jesse, but on her honeymoon is contacted by Kivar who reawakens Isabel&#x27;s evil past self, Vilandra. Kivar tries to compel Isabel/Vilandra to travel through a portal back to their home world, while Max and Michael attempt to stop them. In the end, Isabel pushes Kivar into the portal.

Maria feels the whole &quot;alien thing&quot; is ruining her life and decides to take a break from the gang so she can try to live out a &quot;normal&quot; life. Michael takes a night job as a security guard at a local pharmaceutical factory, where its owners have set a trap for Michael. Knowing that he is an alien, they kill one of Michael&#x27;s co-workers &quot;Munk&quot; to see if Michael is &quot;the healer&quot;. Former Sheriff Valenti has been helping Michael uncover this conspiracy and is shot near his heart. Max gives away his identity as &quot;the healer&quot; saving Valenti, and is taken by the millionaire&#x27;s desperate wife and goons and coerced into healing the dying millionaire. Max is wary of doing so, as the millionaire has lived out his life and will die of natural causes, but he tries anyway. Max ends up transferring his youth, and the millionaire&#x27;s body transforms into Max&#x27;s body, killing Max. 

A grieving Michael and Isabel use their powers to escape the millionaire&#x27;s security staff, but Isabel is shot. Michael unknowingly inherited Max&#x27;s powers after his death, and then he heals Isabel during an emotional moment. He also reveals their alien secret to Jesse, who was going to cal the police. Meanwhile the millionaire, in Max&#x27;s body, starts receiving Max&#x27;s memories, especially unable to stop thinking about Liz. He feels the only way to kill Max&#x27;s soul inside him is to find and kill Liz, and so travels to Vermont with his reluctant wife to find Liz. He murders his wife and in a struggle, falls with Liz from a window of Liz&#x27;s boarding school. Seeing Liz is about to die, Max takes control over the body and uses his powers to save her life while he hits the ground. The millionaire&#x27;s soul dies, and Max miraculously survives after Liz kisses him. The group heads back to Roswell.

Meanwhile, the FBI has been studying the group for many months and is closing in on them, and after Liz also displays alien powers inherited from Max, including s, she also becomes their target. Tess returns from their alien homeworld with Max&#x27;s son, Zan, and they too become targets of the FBI. Tess decides to sacrifice herself by turning herself in and blowing up the military base. The baby is revealed to be fully human, as only Max&#x27;s and Tess&#x27; human DNA produced the baby. Max, realizing his son can have a normal life, gives him up for adoption; showing the Evans&#x27; parents driving the child away to New York.

The series closes with Liz getting a premonition of her, Max, Michael, and Isabel dying in an FBI setup, so they decide to leave Roswell after their high school graduation. Michael professes his love for Maria and she makes the decision to be with him no matter what. After Liz, Max, Michael, Isabel, Maria, and Kyle escape an FBI setup at their high school graduation, they hit the road in a van, where there are several emotional goodbyes, especially between Kyle and his father, Jim Valenti. Isabel decides to leave her husband behind in order to save his life. The final scenes of the show feature Max and Liz getting married and Liz&#x27;s father reading her journal, chronicling the last three years. The series closes with Liz climbing into the van in her wedding dress and narrating, &quot;I&#x27;m Liz Parker, and I&#x27;m happy&quot;.

==Home media==
=== Soundtrack ===
A soundtrack of the series was released on February 26, 2002. The soundtrack featured Ash, Coldplay, Sarah McLachlan and others.

Although the show used many popular songs throughout its original airing, due to licensing issues many songs were replaced on the home video releases, with the new songs handpicked by the show&#x27;s original music supervisors. There are notable exceptions in which songs that became important or symbolic plot moments were retained, such as the use of &quot;Fear&quot; by Sarah McLachlan and &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; by Dave Matthews Band in the pilot and &quot;I Shall Believe&quot; by Sheryl Crow in a later episode. Similarly, Dido&#x27;s &quot;Here with Me&quot; was also kept as the show&#x27;s opening theme music throughout all three seasons on DVD.

However, the German language track is the only audio track to contain the original music. Similarly, the syndicated episodes of the show also contain all of the original music.

==Novels==
In addition to the original &quot;Roswell High&quot; book series that inspired the television series, a range of novels were published based on the events depicted in the show. These focused on events that largely went unexplained on screen.

===Pocket Books===
While &quot;Roswell&quot; was still on air, three novels were published by Pocket Books. When the show was cancelled, this series ceased publication.

# &quot;No Good Deed&quot; by Dean Wesley Smith &amp; Kristine Kathryn Rusch (August 2001)
# &quot;Little Green Men&quot; by D.W. Smith and K.K. Rusch (April 2002)

===Simon Spotlight Entertainment===
In 2002, Simon Spotlight Entertainment picked up the &quot;Roswell&quot; range and published eight more novels. Following low sales, the series ended a year later. The first four novels act as a bridge between seasons two and three, and the last four are set after the events of the series.

<text>Crab football (British English) is an informal sport that originated in Britain in 1863, derived from Association football played by two teams, commonly in physical education classes. As with regular football, the objective is to kick an inflated ball into a goal to score the most points. Unlike football, players support themselves on their hands and move with their feet, in motions that make them look like crabs, a method known as crab walking. Crab football may be played outdoors or in a gymnasium, and is more commonly thought of as being a sport played by children. The game can be played with a regular football, but is often played with a cage ball.

There are various sets of rules, with the main one being that each team must have an equal number of players, teams can vary in sizing 2-11 people depending on space. This sport involves kicking, so safety is at the root of many rules. Like football, the only player that may use their hands is the goalkeeper: all other players must not touch the ball with their hands and must stay in a &quot;crab position&quot; at all times. No players may stand except for the goalkeeper. Once players are equally divided the ref will drop the ball in the middle of the court to begin the game, after each point is scored, and when the ball goes out of bounds. The first team to reach five points wins.

<text>Robert Paul Griffin (November 6, 1923 – April 16, 2015) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. A member of the Republican Party, he served in both chambers of the United States Congress as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1957 to 1966 and a member of the United States Senate from 1966 to 1979 and later served a Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1987 to 1995. He co-sponsored the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which regulates the internal affairs of labor unions. As a deputy minority leader in the Senate, he called on President Richard Nixon, a fellow Republican, to resign during the Watergate scandal.

== Early life ==
Griffin was born in Detroit, Michigan, and attended public schools in Garden City and Dearborn. During the Second World War, he enlisted in the 71st Infantry Division in 1943 and spent fourteen months in Europe. After the war, he graduated from Central Michigan University (known in former times as Central Michigan College) in Mount Pleasant, Michigan in 1947. He received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Michigan Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1950. He commenced the practice of law in Traverse City, Michigan.

== Career ==
Griffin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 9th congressional district in 1956, unseating incumbent Ruth Thompson in the Republican primary. Griffin served in the House during the 85th United States Congress as well as the four succeeding United States Congresses, a period spanning January 3, 1957, until May 10, 1966. After the revelations of the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, which investigated corruption and organized crime influence in labor unions, he and United States House of Representatives member Phillip M. Landrum from Georgia sponsored the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act. He later supported Gerald Ford as the Republican Conference Chairman and later, the House Minority Leader. During his tenure in the House, Griffin voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and 1964, as well as the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

He resigned May 10, 1966, to take a seat in the United States Senate. Following the death of United States Senate member Patrick V. McNamara, governor of Michigan George W. Romney appointed him to finish McNamara&#x27;s term. In the 1966 election, he won election to a full term, defeating former Governor G. Mennen Williams by a 56% to 44% margin. He defeated Attorney General Frank J. Kelley in the 1972 election for a second term.

In 1968, Griffin led a successful filibuster against the nomination of Associate Justice Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Abe Fortas to be elevated to the position of Chief Justice, charging President (and former Senate Majority Leader) Lyndon B. Johnson with cronyism, noting the close relationship between the two. Fortas resigned his Associate Justice seat in May 1969 when it was discovered Fortas had been paid a $20,000 a year retainer by Louis Wolfson, a close friend and former client, since 1966. Griffin voted in favor of both the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court of the United States. He became the Republican Whip in the Senate on September 24, 1969, and served until 1977.

In 1974, he wrote to President Richard Nixon to inform him that if the White House did not release tapes that the United States Senate Watergate Committee subpoenaed, the President would face impeachment and trial in the Senate. He also told the President that he considered the failure to comply with the subpoena as an impeachable offense. Up to that point, Griffin had been a supporter of the President.

Griffin was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1978, narrowly defeated by former Detroit City Council president Carl Levin. He initially announced in April 1977 that he would not run for re-election in 1978, saying that he was tired and that Washington needed new blood. He went on to miss a third of the votes in 1977. He changed his mind later in the campaign and Levin used his own words and his attendance record against him during the campaign.

Later, Griffin served as a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1987 to 1994. His son, Richard Allen Griffin, was a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals from 1989 to 2005, when he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

During the elder Griffin&#x27;s first Senate campaign in 1966, a suburban Detroit rock band, Doug Brown and the Omens, released a promotional flexi disc in support of Griffin&#x27;s candidacy. The song, &quot;Give Bob The Ball&quot; (which extolled Griffin&#x27;s &quot;youth and experience&quot;) has been included on the garage rock compilation album &quot;Friday At The Hideout&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Griffin was a resident of Traverse City, Michigan, in Northern Michigan. He married Marjorie Anderson of Ludington in 1947. Together, they had four children, including Richard Griffin. Griffin died on April 16, 2015, aged 91. He was interred at Linwood Cemetery near Traverse City&#x27;s Long Lake.

<text>In accounting and finance, an accrual is an asset or liability that represents revenue or expenses that are receivable or payable but which have not yet been paid.

In accrual accounting, the term accrued revenue refers to income that is recognized at the time a company delivers a service or good, even though the company has not yet been paid. Likewise, the term accrued expense refers to liabilities that are recognized when a company receives services or goods, even though the company has not yet paid the provider.

Accrued revenue is often recognised as income on an income statement and represented as an accounts receivable on the balance sheet. When the company is paid, the income statement remains unchanged, although the accounts receivable is adjusted and the cash account increased on the balance sheet. On the other hand, an accrued expense is recognised as an expense on the income statement and represented as a liability on the balance sheet. Once payment is made, the income statement remains unaffected, while the accounts payable is adjusted and the cash account reduced on the balance sheet.

In finance, accrual often refers to the accumulation of interest or investment income over a period of time, though the interest or income has yet to be paid.

== Accruals in accounting ==
Accrual accounting recognizes revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred, not necessarily when cash is received or paid. For instance, if a company delivers a product in one financial year but will receive payment in the next, the revenue is recognized in the current financial year. Similarly, the company who receives the product also recognizes the expenses incurred in the current financial year, even if the actual payment is made later.

This approach contrasts with cash basis accounting, which recognizes transactions only when cash changes hands.
=== Accrued revenue ===
Accrued revenue, also known as accrued assets, refers to income earned but not yet received. For example, a company delivering a service or product may record the revenue even if payment will be received later. In rental agreements, where billing cycles don’t align with financial periods, companies must accrue revenue based on the days the service was provided before the billing date.

=== Accrued expense ===
An accrued expense is a liability for goods or services received but not yet paid for. These expenses are recorded when incurred, even if the payment will happen later. For instance, a company may receive services in one period but pay for them in the next. The uncertainty surrounding the timing or exact amount of accrued expenses is usually minor compared to provisions, which account for larger uncertainties.

IAS 37 explains that accrued expenses differ from provisions because they are more certain in timing and amount. Accrued expenses, like employee vacation pay, are often listed under trade and other payables:
== Other uses ==

In payroll, a common benefit that an employer will provide for employees is a vacation or sick accrual. This means that as time passes, an employee accumulates additional sick leave or vacation time and this time is placed into a bank. Once the time is accumulated, the employer or the employer&#x27;s payroll provider will track the amount of time used for sick or vacation.

When referring to clinical trials, the definition of &quot;accrual&quot; is either the process of recruiting patients into a trial, or the number of patients in a trial.

<doc id="882684" wikidata="Q6516219" url="?curid=882684" title="Leek Wootton">
<text>Leek Wootton is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Leek Wootton and Guy&#x27;s Cliffe, in the Warwick district, in the county of Warwickshire, England, approximately south of Kenilworth and north of Warwick. It lies in the triangle created by Kenilworth, Warwick and Leamington Spa. In 1961 the parish had a population of 671.

==Geography==
The civil parish of Leek Wootton and Guy&#x27;s Cliffe, including the hamlets of Hill Wootton, Chesford, Goodrest, North and Middle Woodloes, has a population of approximately 1,100. The village is adjacent to the A46 dual-carriageway trunk road. The nearest railway station is Warwick town with Warwick Parkway further away. The nearest airport is Birmingham Airport (11.7 miles). 

There are numerous public footpaths and walks in the parish, including the &quot;Tink-a-Tank&quot;, (believed to have been named because people used to use the path to walk to church and think about God and thank him for his blessings), several across the golf courses, a woodland walk between the Coventry Road (B4115), which crosses the A46 road and comes out at the north end of the village on the Warwick Road, and a small area of woodland to the north west of the village (accessed from Waller Close and the Recreation Ground). To the north of Leek Wootton is the &quot;Cattle Brook&quot; and just north of Hill Wootton this meets the much larger River Avon, which forms the south-eastern boundary of the Parish.

==History==

Blacklow Hill is located south of the village, close to the A46 road. Its name comes from the fact the trees that partly cover it are very dark (black) and the Anglo-Saxon &quot;hlaew&quot; (burial mound). In 1971 an archaeological team found flints and hunting tools from the early Mesolithic period, around 9,000 B.C., and three graves of Anglo-Saxon origin. 

The monument &quot;Gaveston&#x27;s Cross&quot; is in the wood on the hill. It marks the point where Piers Gaveston was murdered. In 1308 Edward II travelled to Boulogne to marry Isabella, leaving Piers Gaveston, a Gascon knight to act as regent. Resentment against the king&#x27;s rule and Gaveston&#x27;s position of power grew, some barons began to demand the banishment of Gaveston. Edward could do little to prevent Gaveston being captured in 1312, under the orders of the Earl of Lancaster and his allies. He was captured first by the Earl of Warwick, whom he was seen to have offended, and handed over to two Welshmen. They took him to &quot;Blacklow Hill&quot; and murdered him; one ran him through the heart with his sword and the other beheaded him.

The railway bridge over the road, between Leek Wootton and Hill Wootton, on the Coventry to Leamington Line, collapsed in a railway accident on 11 June 1861, with the driver and fireman being killed.

On 1 April 1986 the parish was abolished and merged with Guy&#x27;s Cliffe to form &quot;Leek Wootton and Guy&#x27;s Cliffe&quot;.

==Local economy and services==
===All Saints&#x27; Church, Leek Wootton===
The parish church is All Saints&#x27;, an Anglican church centred in the middle of the village. The current vicar of the church is The Reverend Jim Perryman.

===All Saints&#x27; CofE Academy, Leek Wootton===
When Leek Wootton First School was threatened with closure in the early 1990s, the community campaigned to save it and a new school was built at the southern end of the village and All Saints&#x27; Church of England (Voluntary Aided) Primary School was opened in 1996 by The Right Reverend Simon Barrington-Ward, Bishop of Coventry. Since 1 September 2014 All Saints’ and Burton Green Primary Schools have been working together as a federation of schools. On 1 March 2018 All Saints&#x27; and Burton Green schools became academies and members of the Coventry Diocesan Multi-Academy Trust. On 24 April 2018 The Right Reverend Christopher Cocksworth, Bishop of Coventry, attended both schools to formally welcome them into the trust.

===Leek Wootton War Memorial Recreation Ground===
The War Memorial Recreation Ground is to the north-west of the village. &quot;The Rec&quot; as it is known locally is home to a children&#x27;s playground, Leek Wootton Village Hall and Leek Wootton Sports Club, which includes a cricket club that competes in the Cotswold Hills League, and a junior football club. 

===The Warwickshire Golf and Country Club===
Leek Wootton is home to The Warwickshire Golf and Country Club, and has the Anchor Inn public house at its centre. The &quot;Chesford Grange Hotel&quot; also falls within the boundaries of the civil parish, as does the Saxon Mill at Guy&#x27;s Cliffe. The Warwickshire Golf and Country Club is an exclusive members only club and comprises two 18-hole golf courses, a par-3 course and a comprehensive leisure centre with gym, indoor pools, and spa. 

===Woodcote House and Estate===
Woodcote is a 19th-century manor house and estate on the western boundary of the village. During the Second World War it was repurposed as a convalescent home for military personnel and was home to the headquarters of Warwickshire Police from 1949. A new purpose-built headquarters for the Police at Woodcote was proposed, but the planning application was refused by Warwick District Council on 31 October 2007. A revised application was subsequently approved, but the site was not redeveloped. In 2011 it was announced that Woodcote was to be sold, and the headquarters relocated to Leamington Spa. Following the construction of a new control room in Warwick and the inclusion of some of the estate in a local housing planning allocation, the site was put up for sale in 2018. On 1 April 2019 Warwickshire Police announced that, due to the collapse of its alliance with West Mercia Police, Warwickshire Police would be returning to Woodcote and it would become the Service&#x27;s headquarters again. This resulted in the sale of the estate being halted.

===Community Events===
In 2016, for HM The Queen&#x27;s 90th Birthday celebrations, the annual Church Garden Fete was amalgamated into a Parish Fete held on &quot;The Rec&quot;. This has remained a regular event, with a break in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19. In 2022 a Big Jubilee Lunch was held instead for HM The Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee.

Leek Wootton &amp; District Horticultural Society holds an Annual Flower Show at the Village hall on the Saturday of the weekend before the August Bank Holiday. There are various gardening, cooking and household classes and children&#x27;s competitions, ranging from miniature gardens to digital art. Unclaimed entries are entered into an arction of produce at the end of the event.

<doc id="882686" wikidata="Q5505104" url="?curid=882686" title="Frobenius–Schur indicator">
<text>In mathematics, and especially the discipline of representation theory, the Schur indicator, named after Issai Schur, or Frobenius–Schur indicator describes what invariant bilinear forms a given irreducible representation of a compact group on a complex vector space has. It can be used to classify the irreducible representations of compact groups on real vector spaces.

==Definition==

If a finite-dimensional continuous representation of a compact group &quot;G&quot; has character χ its Frobenius–Schur indicator is defined to be

:formula_1

for Haar measure μ with μ(&quot;G&quot;) = 1. When &quot;G&quot; is finite it is given by

:formula_2

If χ is a complex irreducible representation, then its Frobenius–Schur indicator is 1, 0, or −1. It provides a criterion for deciding whether a real irreducible representation of &quot;G&quot; is real, complex or quaternionic, in a specific sense defined below. Much of the content below discusses the case of finite groups, but the general compact case is analogous.

There are &quot;three types&quot; of irreducible real representations of a finite group on a real vector space &quot;V&quot;, as Schur&#x27;s lemma implies that the endomorphism ring commuting with the group action is a real associative division algebra and by the Frobenius theorem can only be isomorphic to either the real numbers, or the complex numbers, or the quaternions.

*If the ring is the real numbers, then &quot;V&quot;⊗C is an irreducible complex representation with Schur indicator 1, also called a real representation.
*If the ring is the complex numbers, then &quot;V&quot; has two different conjugate complex structures, giving two irreducible complex representations with Schur indicator 0, sometimes called complex representations.
*If the ring is the quaternions, then choosing a subring of the quaternions isomorphic to the complex numbers makes &quot;V&quot; into an irreducible complex representation of &quot;G&quot; with Schur indicator −1, called a quaternionic representation.

Moreover every irreducible representation on a complex vector space can be constructed from a unique irreducible representation on a real vector space in one of the three ways above. So knowing the irreducible representations on complex spaces and their Schur indicators allows one to read off the irreducible representations on real spaces.

Real representations can be complexified to get a complex representation of the same dimension and complex representations can be converted into a real representation of twice the dimension by treating the real and imaginary components separately. Also, since all finite dimensional complex representations can be turned into a unitary representation, for unitary representations the dual representation is also a (complex) conjugate representation because the Hilbert space norm gives an antilinear bijective map from the representation to its dual representation.

Self-dual complex irreducible representation correspond to either real irreducible representation of the same dimension or real irreducible representations of twice the dimension called quaternionic representations (but not both) and non-self-dual complex irreducible representation correspond to a real irreducible representation of twice the dimension. Note for the latter case, both the complex irreducible representation and its dual give rise to the same real irreducible representation. An example of a quaternionic representation would be the four-dimensional real irreducible representation of the quaternion group &quot;Q&quot;8.

==Definition in terms of the symmetric and alternating square==
If is the underlying vector space of a representation of a group , then the tensor product representation formula_3 can be decomposed as the direct sum of two subrepresentations, the symmetric square, denoted formula_4 (also often denoted by formula_5 or formula_6) and the alternating square, formula_7(also often denoted by formula_8, formula_9, or formula_10). In terms of these square representations, the indicator has the following, alternate definition:

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the trivial representation.

To see this, note that the term formula_13 naturally arises in the characters of these representations; to wit, we haveformula_14andformula_15.Substituting either of these formulae, the Frobenius–Schur indicator takes on the structure of the natural -invariant inner product on class functions:formula_16The inner product counts the multiplicities of direct summands; the equivalence of the definitions then follows immediately.

==Applications==

Let be an irreducible complex representation of a group (or equivalently, an irreducible formula_17-module, where formula_17 denotes the group ring). Then 
# There exists a nonzero -invariant bilinear form on if and only if formula_19
# There exists a nonzero -invariant &quot;symmetric&quot; bilinear form on if and only if formula_20
# There exists a nonzero -invariant &quot;skew-symmetric&quot; bilinear form on if and only if formula_21.

The above is a consequence of the universal properties of the symmetric algebra and exterior algebra, which are the underlying vector spaces of the symmetric and alternating square.

Additionally, 
# formula_22 if and only if formula_23 is not real-valued (these are complex representations),
# formula_20 if and only if formula_23 can be realized over formula_26 (these are real representations), and
# formula_21 if and only if formula_23 is real but cannot be realized over formula_26 (these are quaternionic representations).

==Higher Frobenius-Schur indicators==
Just as for any complex representation ρ,

:formula_30

is a self-intertwiner, for any integer &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_31

is also a self-intertwiner. By Schur&#x27;s lemma, this will be a multiple of the identity for irreducible representations. The trace of this self-intertwiner is called the nth &quot;Frobenius-Schur indicator&quot;.

The original case of the Frobenius–Schur indicator is that for &quot;n&quot; = 2. The zeroth indicator is the dimension of the irreducible representation, the first indicator would be 1 for the trivial representation and zero for the other irreducible representations.

It resembles the Casimir invariants for Lie algebra irreducible representations. In fact, since any representation of G can be thought of as a module for C[&quot;G&quot;] and vice versa, we can look at the center of C[&quot;G&quot;]. This is analogous to looking at the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. It is simple to check that

:formula_32

belongs to the center of C[&quot;G&quot;], which is simply the subspace of class functions on &quot;G&quot;.

<doc id="882691" wikidata="Q192295" url="?curid=882691" title="Gol Gumbaz">
<text>Gol Gumbaz (), also written Gol Gumbad, is a 17th-century mausoleum located in Bijapur, a city in Karnataka, India. It houses the remains of Mohammad Adil Shah, seventh sultan of the Adil Shahi dynasty, and some of his relatives. Begun in the mid-17th century, the structure never reached completion. The mausoleum is notable for its scale and exceptionally large dome. The structure is an important example of Adil Shahi architecture. 

The building is one of those put by UNESCO on its &quot;tentative list&quot; to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate.

== History ==
The construction of the Gol Gumbaz began in the mid-17th century, during the close of Mohammed Adil Shah&#x27;s reign, which was from 1627 to 1656. It is located directly behind the &quot;dargah&quot; of Hashim Pir, a Sufi saint; Richard Eaton views this as suggestive of the close relationship between the ruler and the saint. The mausoleum was never completed; construction may have halted in 1656 due to Mohammed Adil Shah&#x27;s death that year.

==Architecture==
The Gol Gumbaz is one of the most ambitious structures built by the Adil Shahi dynasty. It is the most technically advanced domed structure to have been erected in the Deccan, and one of the largest single-chamber structures in the world. The architect of the structure is not known. Bianca Alfieri asserts that the building&#x27;s size was a conscious decision made by Mohammed Adil Shah in order to rival the architecture of the Ibrahim Rauza, the tomb of the ruler&#x27;s predecessor Ibrahim Adil Shah II. Alternatively, Elizabeth Merklinger suggests that the size was an attempt to assert the stature of the Adil Shahi dynasty, in light of its later absorption by the Mughal Empire. 

The mausoleum is contained in a larger walled complex, with other buildings such as a mosque, a &quot;naqqar khana,&quot; and a &quot;dharmshala&quot;.

=== Plan and exterior ===
Despite the grand nature of the monument, the plan of the Gol Gumbaz is simple. It is a cube 47.5m on each side, topped by a hemispherical dome of diameter approximately 44m. Domed octagonal towers, each divided into seven floors and topped by a bulbous dome, line the four corners of the cube. The levels of the towers are marked by arcades and contain staircases within. 

The walls of the structure are built of dark grey basalt and decorated plaster. Each side wall of the cube bears three blind arches; the spandrels of the arches contain medallion motifs, and the central arch on each side wall is filled with a stone screen containing doorways and windows. Cornices project from the building, supported by corbels. Atop the cornices are rows of small arches, themselves topped by large merlons. Leaves surround the base of the mausoleum&#x27;s dome, hiding the joint between the dome and its drum.

=== Interior ===

The interior is a huge single chamber that is approximately 41.5 m across and 60 m high. In the centre of the chamber floor is a raised platform bearing the cenotaphs of Mohammad Adil Shah, his younger wife Arus Bibi, his older wife, his favourite mistress Rhamba, his daughter, and a grandson. The cenotaphs mark the location of the actual tombs, which are found in a crypt underneath and accessed by a staircase under the western entrance of the mausoleum. Though typical of Indian Muslim tombs, this is the only instance of such a practice in Adil Shahi architecture. Mohammad Adil Shah&#x27;s cenotaph is covered by a wooden canopy; Michell and Zebrowski speculate that this is a later addition. A half-octagonal room is attached to the north facade of the building, though this is also a later addition.

=== Dome ===
At the time of its construction, the Gol Gumbaz boasted the largest dome in the Islamic world. Its external diameter is nearly 44 m. The dome is built of brick and cemented with layers of lime. It has six small openings in its base as well as a flat section at its crown. The dome rests on a circular base, which is internally supported by interlocking pendentives, formed from eight intersecting arches that arise from the interior hall. Similar vaulting is found, though on a smaller scale, in the Jami Masjid of Bijapur and the Ibrahim Rauza. Outside of Bijapur, this pendentive support system is virtually unknown. The conceptual origin of the Gol Gumbaz&#x27;s pendentives is debated, though a Central Asian influence has been suggested by multiple scholars.

Around the base of the dome is a gallery, accessed by the staircases in the towers. It is known as the &#x27;whispering gallery&#x27; since the faintest sound from here is heard across the dome, due to sound reflecting off the dome.

==Art and literature==
In Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833 is a picture of Gol Gumbaz entitled &quot;Tomb of Mahomed Shah&quot; by Samuel Prout, engraved by R. Sands and accompanied by a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon reflecting on the claim that he had a happy end.

<text>Xinerama is an extension to the X Window System that enables X applications and window managers to use two or more physical displays as one large virtual display.

Developed under the name &quot;PanoramiX&quot; by Madeline T. Asmus of the Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Unix X Server Engineering Group, the software was contributed to The Open Group for X11 Release 6.4 (X11R6.4) and renamed Xinerama. It was then incorporated into the XFree86 4.0 release in 1998 and the Solaris 7 11/99 release. According to X Server project lead Rob Lembree, the name was inspired by the Cinerama widescreen theatre process. &quot;We were frustrated by having big Alpha machines with multiple displays, and being unable to move applications from one to another. It was developed as much out of frustration as out of competitive advantage.&quot;
Xinerama advantages include the ability to only maximize windows to the dimensions of the active physical display, and to allow new pop-up windows on the active physical display.

==General theory of operation==
When Xinerama is enabled in the X server, multiple X screens can be unified into a single workspace. This unified work area allows windows to be transferred across X screens.

==XINERAMA extension==
The Xinerama extension provides clients with information about the layout of viewports within the unified workspace. Its information regarding offset and size information allows clients to make intelligent decisions about window placement, window maximization and other user interaction events.

===Use in non-XINERAMA environments===
The X server&#x27;s client/server architecture allows the server to expose Xinerama information to the client regardless of whether the Xinerama infrastructure is active. RandR and NVidia&#x27;s twinview utilize this feature to provide window managers and clients with information about the output layout relative to the framebuffer.

==Known problems==

===Common color depth===
Xinerama requires that all of the physical screens have the same bit depth. For example, an 8-bit screen cannot be combined with a 16-bit screen.

===Hardware rendering===
In some implementations, OpenGL direct-rendering only works on one screen. Windows that should show 3D graphics on other screens tend to appear black, a problem most commonly seen with 3D screen savers. The Solaris SPARC OpenGL implementation and ATI and nVidia proprietary Linux drivers support hardware-accelerated rendering of all screens in Xinerama mode.

===Static configuration===
Physical screens cannot be added or removed dynamically, and there is no way to change the resolution of a screen. This is particularly difficult for mobile computer users, who may use an external physical display in addition to the computer&#x27;s built-in screen, but only at certain locations. It is recommended that RandR or ATI&#x27;s or nVidia&#x27;s single GPU method be used in these cases. Xinerama&#x27;s lack of support for adding or removing screens causes several problems:

* Windows may be drawn to a screen that is not connected to the computer. The user is required to drag these windows to the main screen, but is unable to see them.
* Video signals sent to disconnected displays use unnecessary power and may reduce battery life.
* It becomes difficult to use a device in multiple locations, where available external screens are likely to be configured differently.

These problems are related to Xinerama&#x27;s implementation rather than its design, and can be corrected with further development.

===Window manager support===

Some window managers and desktop environments have limited awareness of the separate physical screens in Xinerama, so that the desktop is simply stretched over the physical screens instead of arranged as a single large desktop. The window manager may place a new window on an unexpected screen, which can be confusing and annoying. Xinerama nevertheless offers the advantage that windows can be moved between screens.

===Dead space===
The physical displays do not need to be the same resolution, and the virtual display area is not necessarily rectangular if the component physical displays are not the same size. Some window managers assume a rectangular display area, and enforce this by creating excess &quot;dead space&quot; at the edges of a display. The window manager needs awareness of Xinerama to avoid placing new windows in this dead space.

<text>Andrei Sergeyevich Konchalovsky (; born 20 August 1937) is a Soviet and Russian filmmaker. He has worked in Soviet, Hollywood, and contemporary Russian cinema. He is a laureate of the Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot;, a National Order of the Legion of Honour, an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters, a Cavalier of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic and a People&#x27;s Artist of the RSFSR. He is the son of writer Sergey Mikhalkov, and the brother of filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov.

Konchalovsky&#x27;s work has encompassed theatrical motion pictures, telefilms, documentaries, and stage productions. His film credits include &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1970), &quot;Siberiade&quot; (1979), &quot;Maria&#x27;s Lovers&quot; (1984), &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985), &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; (1989), &quot;House of Fools&quot; (2002), &quot;The Postman&#x27;s White Nights&quot; (2014), &quot;Paradise&quot; (2016), and &quot;Dear Comrades!&quot; (2020). He also directed the 1997 miniseries adaptation of the ancient Greek narrative &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. Earlier in his career, he was a collaborator of Andrei Tarkovsky. His films have won numerous accolades, including the Cannes Grand Prix Spécial du Jury, a FIPRESCI Award, two Silver Lions, three Golden Eagle Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award.

==Early life and ancestry==
Konchalovsky was born Andrei Sergeyevich Mikhalkov in Moscow, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, into an old aristocratic Mikhalkov family, with centuries-old artistic and aristocratic heritage tracing their roots to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (in 2009 he testified that a great-grandfather resided in Lithuania). His father was writer Sergey Mikhalkov, and his mother was poet Natalia Konchalovskaya. His brother is filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov. He is frequently referred to as &quot;Andron&quot;, but as he stated several times, Andron was just a diminutive used by his grandfather and never was his official name; he prefers the name Andrei.

== Career ==
He studied for ten years at the Moscow Conservatory, preparing for a pianist&#x27;s career. In 1960, however, he met Andrei Tarkovsky. Konchalovsky made four films with Tarkovsky: &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot;, &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot;, &quot;The End of Ataman&quot;, and &quot;The Ferocious One&quot;.

==Career==

His first full-length feature, &quot;The First Teacher&quot; (1964), was favourably received in the Soviet Union and screened by numerous film festivals abroad. His second film, &quot;Asya Klyachina&#x27;s Story&quot; (1967), was suppressed by Soviet authorities. When issued twenty years later, it was acclaimed as his masterpiece. Thereupon, Konchalovsky filmed adaptations of Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Nest of Gentle Folk&quot; (1969) and Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1970), with Innokenty Smoktunovsky in the title role.

In 1979 he was a member of the jury at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. His epic &quot;Siberiade&quot; upon its 1979 release was favourably received at Cannes, particularly for its scene featuring the binding and abuse of a Siberian Lynx, and made possible his move to the United States in 1980. 

His most popular Hollywood releases are &quot;Maria&#x27;s Lovers&quot; (1984), &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985), based on a script by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa (who had written it as an adaptation of Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;House of the Dead&quot;), and &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; (1989), starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. In 1985, Ned Tanen wanted to hire Konchalovsky to direct &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, but the other executives at Paramount Pictures concluded the film could not be made without Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo&#x27;s involvement. In the 1990s, Konchalovsky returned to Russia, although he occasionally produced historical films for U.S. television, such as his adaption of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (1997) and the award-winning remake, &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (2003). In a 2023 SAG-AFTRA Foundation interview, Emily Blunt stated that she auditioned for a role in the latter film, and said of Konchalovsky that &quot;he was vile... he was really horrible,&quot; and that he was &quot;really cruel during the audition and loved taking me down a peg or two.&quot; Blunt claimed that he promoted a &quot;very misogynistic sort of vibe, and I was a shell of my former self by the time I came out.&quot;

Konchalovsky&#x27;s full-length feature, &quot;House of Fools&quot; (2003), with a cameo role by Bryan Adams as himself, set in a Chechen psychiatric asylum during the war, won him a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

In 2010, Konchalovsky released a longtime passion project of his, &quot;The Nutcracker in 3D&quot;, a musical adaptation of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet. A musical film, it mixed live action and 3D animation, and starred Elle Fanning, John Turturro, Nathan Lane, and Richard E. Grant. The film was scored with music from the ballet, with additional lyrics by Tim Rice. The film was universally panned by critics and audiences.

In the same year, Konchalovsky also featured in &quot;Hitler in Hollywood&quot;, a bio-doc about Micheline Presle which evolves into a thrilling investigation of the long hidden truth behind European cinema. This mockumentary thriller uncovers Hollywood&#x27;s unsuspected plot against the European motion picture industry. The film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and was nominated for a Crystal Globe award in July 2010.

In 2012, Konchalovsky wrote, directed and produced &quot;The Battle for Ukraine&quot;, which provided an in depth analysis of how Ukraine to this day struggles to escape from the close embrace of its former big brother, Russia. This extensive study lasted for almost three years and involved an array of Ukrainian, Russian and American historians, politicians and journalists, as well as the ex-President of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski, the ex-President of Slovakia Rudolf Schuster, the ex-President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, the ex-Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin, and the businessman Boris Berezovsky.

2013 saw Konchalovsky co-produce a story previously untold on film. Film-maker Margy Kinmonth invited Charles III, at the time the Prince of Wales, to make a journey through history to celebrate the artistic gene in his family and reveal an extraordinary treasure trove of work by royal hands past and present, many of whom were accomplished artists. Set against the spectacular landscapes of the Royal Estates and containing insights into works by members of the British royal family down the centuries and The Prince of Wales&#x27;s own watercolours, &quot;Royal Paintbox&quot; explores a colourful palette of intimate family memory and observation.

His film &quot;The Postman&#x27;s White Nights&quot; won the Silver Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. The script is centered around the true story of Aleksey Tryaptisyn, a real life Russian Post officer based in a remote Russian Far North village surrounding Lake Kenozero.

In 2016, &quot;Paradise&quot; directed by him won the Silver Lion at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. It was selected as the Russian entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 89th Academy Awards.

In 2020, Konchalovsky directed &quot;Dear Comrades!&quot;, a historical drama about the Novocherkassk massacre. The film won the Special Jury Prize at the 77th Venice International Film Festival. Anthony Lane, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, called the film Konchalovsky&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece.&quot;

==Political views==
In 2012, Konchalovsky was one of 103 public figures to sign a petition in support of the band Pussy Riot during their 2012 trial.

Konchalovsky endorsed Sergey Sobyanin of United Russia in the 2013 Moscow mayoral election.

In the run-up to the Russian presidential election in 2024, Konchalovsky supported Vladimir Putin&#x27;s candidacy, describing him as &quot;an extraordinary leader, the most courageous and wise person&quot;.

==Personal life==
Konchalovsky has been married five times. His first wife was Irina Kandat. His second wife was Russian actress Natalya Arinbasarova, with whom he has one son: Russian film director Egor, born 15 January 1966. His third wife was Viviane Godet, with whom he has a daughter, Alexandra Mikhalkova, born 6 October 1971. His fourth wife was Irina Ivanova, with whom he has two daughters: Nathalia and Elena. His fifth wife is Russian actress Julia Vysotskaya; they have been married since 1998 and have two children: Maria (1999) and Petr (2003).

In October 2013, Konchalovsky and daughter Maria were involved in a vehicular collision in the south of France. Konchalovsky lost control of a rented Mercedes and swerved into oncoming traffic, where he crashed into another car. Maria suffered a traumatic brain injury and was placed into an induced coma. By 2018, Maria&#x27;s condition had improved, and she returned to Russia with her parents.

<doc id="882717" wikidata="Q10385027" url="?curid=882717" title="Groton, Connecticut">
<text>Groton ( ) is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States, located on the Thames River. It is the home of General Dynamics Electric Boat, which is the major contractor for submarine work for the United States Navy. The Naval Submarine Base New London is located in Groton, and the pharmaceutical company Pfizer is also a major employer. Avery Point in Groton is home to a regional campus of the University of Connecticut. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 38,411 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Groton was established in 1705 when it separated from New London. The town was named after Groton, Suffolk in England. A hundred years before it was established, the Niantic people settled in the area between the Thames River and Pawcatuck River, but they eventually settled in Westerly, Rhode Island. The newcomers to the land were the Pequots, a branch of the Mohawk people who moved eastward into the Connecticut River Valley.

The summer of 1614 was the first time that the Pequots encountered white settlers. They started trading furs for the settlers&#x27; goods, such as steel knives, needles, and boots. In 1633, the Dutch bought land from them and opened a fur trading post. Meanwhile, the English bought land for settlement from the local tribes. The Dutch had unintentionally killed the Pequots&#x27; chief, and this prompted revenge by the Pequot tribe, and this escalated into the Pequot War (1636–1638). On the night of May 26, 1637, the Colonial forces arrived outside the Pequot village near the Mystic River. The palisade surrounding the village had only two exits, and their leader Colonel John Mason gave the order to set the village on fire and block off the exits. Those who tried climbing over the palisade were shot; anyone who succeeded in getting over was killed by the Narragansett forces.

The land was poor for farming, but access to the region&#x27;s waterways left room for commerce and trade, and Groton became a town of oceangoing settlers. Most of the community began to build ships, and soon traders made their way to Massachusetts Bay Colony and Plymouth Colony to trade for food, tools, weapons, and clothing. John Leeds was the earliest shipbuilder, coming as a sea captain from Kent, England. He built a 20-ton brigantine, a two-masted sailing ship with square-rigged sails on the foremast and fore-and-aft sails on the mainmast. Thomas Starr built a 67-ton square-sterned vessel, and Thomas Latham launched a 100-ton brig on the Groton bank with mast standing and fully rigged. The sturdy ships built in Groton engaged in highly profitable trade with the islands of the Caribbean.

===American Revolution===

On September 6, 1781, the Battle of Groton Heights was fought between a combined force of state troops and local militia led by William Ledyard and British forces led by Benedict Arnold. No one at Fort Griswold had expected an attack, especially after six years of false alarms. At sunrise, a force of 1,700 British regulars landed on both sides of the mouth of the Thames River. The fleet had sailed from Long Island the evening before, and only a sudden shift in the wind prevented a surprise attack during the night; it was 9 a.m. the next day before the transports could come ashore to land the troops.

Across the Thames River in New London, Benedict Arnold was leading an 800-man detachment which destroyed stockpiles of goods and naval stores. His men set fire to a ship containing gunpowder which created an uncontrollable fire that destroyed most of New London. Meanwhile, a British force of 800 men moved toward Fort Griswold in Groton, which was garrisoned by 164 American troops. The British sent a flag of surrender to Fort Griswold, but Ledyard refused and returned it. Arnold&#x27;s men then attacked, initiating the Battle of Groton Heights. After an initial repulse, the British succeeded in entering the fort and overpowering the small American garrison inside. The British suffered 52 killed and 145 wounded, while American casualties amounted to 85 killed and 60 wounded. Ledyard allegedly surrendered to a Loyalist officer, Major Stephen Bromfield, who purportedly killed him with own sword. Jonathan Rathbun described the surrender this way:

A memorial for the battle was erected in 1830 for the 85 American soldiers who were killed at the fort. Fort Griswold is the only intact memorial in town left from the Revolutionary War. The monument has become the town&#x27;s symbol and is now featured on the Groton town seal.

=== Early 19th century ===
Shortly after the Revolutionary War, Groton started to re-establish its commercial activities. Shipbuilders began to build again; &quot;Victory&quot; was launched in 1784, &quot;Success&quot; was launched in 1785, and five sloops were built in 1787, along with the 164-ton &quot;Nancy&quot;. Shipbuilders along the Mystic River were the busiest. These ships went on trips to Florida, and the resulting profits made Mystic the most thriving part of the town.

Between 1784 and 1800, 32 vessels were built in Groton. 28 more were built from 1800 to 1807, when business came to a sudden stop with the Embargo Act. In June 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain. Most of the United States&#x27; small navy was landlocked in the Thames River. This frightened the people in Groton for fear that there would be a repeat of the Groton Heights massacre of 1781, and many residents fled inland for safety. Those that did not flee demanded protection and militia. These residents built a fort on a hill of rock that held one cannon and maintained constant guard. The fort was named Fort Rachel, after a woman that lived nearby. The British never attacked but created a blockade that ruined Groton&#x27;s trade.

Some men from Mystic lured a British barge to Groton Long Point on August 12, 1814, the day after the British attacked Stonington, gaining themselves 2,600 dollars in prize money; a minor event later known as &quot;The Battle of Groton Long Point.&quot; The men in Mystic captured a sloop, the cargo of which they later sold for 6,000 dollars. Seventeen Mystic men also tried out a new weapon called the spar torpedo to rid themselves of the British blockade. They brought the torpedo from New York; it was long, in diameter, and had a crossbar at one end. The men failed to sink . On their first attempt, the torpedo went into the water; on the second attempt, the explosive caught on &quot;Ramillies&quot;″ cable and exploded. All the men made it safely to the shore while being fired at by the British ship and the American sentries at Eastern Point.

Groton received word that the war was over on February 21, 1815. The land-locked frigates left the Thames in April, leaving Groton to resume its marine pursuits.

After the War of 1812, whaling became a very important part of Groton&#x27;s economy, but most of the expeditions were still for seal skins. Before 1820, sealers went to Antarctica, where their ships would drop them off. They would kill the seals and then prepare the skins for some weeks, until their ship returned for them. By 1830, whaling had become Mystic&#x27;s main business. By 1846, Groton became one of the world&#x27;s prime whaling ports. Whaling was difficult and dangerous, but boys would go out to sea to make their fortune, nonetheless, in the hope that some of them would eventually come to command a vessel.

In 1865, Ebenezer Morgan made one of the most profitable voyages. He sold his cargo for $150,000. Three years later, he raised the first American flag on Alaskan territory, and there he collected 45,000 seal skins. When he retired, it was said that his estate totaled up to $1 million.

William H. Allen, another son of Groton, spent 25 years commanding a whale ship. Old sailors said that &quot;whales rose to the surface and waited to be harpooned.&quot; When he retired, he spent 12 years working as a selectman.

=== Late 19th century ===

In 1849, the discovery of gold in California created a demand for speed that resulted in the creation of the clipper ship, a fast sailing ship with multiple masts and a square rig. The most important vessel built at the Mystic River Shipyard was the clipper ship &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;. In 1859, it sailed from New York City to San Francisco in a record time of 89 days and 4 hours. Both clippers and sailing packets were built in the shipyards of the Mystic River at that time. The Mystic shipyards started building ships with a greater cargo capacity after the Civil War.

Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy during the Civil War, wanted three experimental ironclad steamers to be built in private shipyards and used against the Confederacy&#x27;s wooden fleet. A company in Groton was chosen to build a bomb-proof steamer designed by C.S. Bushnell of New Haven. 100 men were hired, and a big shed was built so that construction could continue rain or shine. The ship was ready for launching in 130 days. There were many skeptics who believed that the ship would sink or corrode once it hit the salt water, and there were very few who thought that it might float. Thousands came to watch &#x27;s launch on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1862. Reporters commented that she floated like a duck. When it came time for &quot;Galena&quot; to enter battle, she was pierced 13 times. Thirteen of the crew members were killed and 11 were wounded from flying metal fragments. During the Civil War, 56 steamships were built for government service in shipyards on both sides of the Mystic River.

After the war, there were dozens of excess war steamships and, after 1870, shipbuilding moved up to Noank within the Groton town limits. One of the largest shipyards was Palmer Shipyard, established in Noank in 1827. A marine railway built in Groton in 1860 allowed them to pull vessels out of the water for repairs, which brought in a lot of business and money. The shipyard was running up to 1913 when one of the Palmer brothers died, but during World War I the shipyard was used again. Iron ships began to be demanded, and their construction attracted workers to Groton. Housing was beginning to run short, so Groton Realty had to hurry to build hotels and cottages. The ships which brought the workers in turn also brought more business to the Realty.

The Naval Submarine Base New London was founded in Groton in 1872 as the New London Navy Yard. Submarines were first based there in 1915, and in 1916 it was officially renamed a submarine base.

Groton used to include what is now the town of Ledyard, which separated from Groton in 1836. The original center of Groton is still known as Center Groton at the present-day intersection of Route 184 and Route 117, now in the north-central part of town, due to the departure of Ledyard to the north. Groton Center was the location of the town&#x27;s first school, church, tavern, and stagecoach shop.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, the shipbuilding industry moved from the Mystic River to the Thames River. Electric Boat is the town&#x27;s largest employer. However, until 1931, submarines designed by Electric Boat were subcontracted to other shipyards, primarily Fore River Shipbuilding in Quincy, Massachusetts. Electric Boat commenced industrial operations in Groton with the establishment of the New London Ship and Engine Company (NELSECO) as a subsidiary in 1911. NELSECO was the primary engine manufacturer for Electric Boat-designed submarines 1911–1925. In 1931, was laid down as the first submarine built in Groton. During World War II, Electric Boat completed submarines every two weeks.

In 1954, Electric Boat launched , the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine. Presently, &quot;Nautilus&quot; is decommissioned and open for visitors, permanently berthed at the U.S. Navy Submarine Force Library and Museum. Groton is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Submarine Capital of the World,&quot; due to the long-standing history of submarines in the town, and the fact that Groton has one of the largest submarine bases in the world. The National World War II Submarine Memorial East is located in Groton, including parts of .

The Groton and Stonington Street Railway was a trolley line that was created in 1904 to serve the Groton area. The trolley was dismantled and replaced by buses in 1928.

<text>James Merrill Carlsmith (April 12, 1936 – April 19, 1984) was an American social psychologist perhaps best known for his collaboration with Leon Festinger and Elliot Aronson in the creation and development of cognitive dissonance theory. He also worked extensively with Mark Lepper on the subject of attribution theory. With Jonathan L. Freedman and David O. Sears (his cousin) he wrote the textbook, &quot;Social Psychology&quot; (1970; subsequent editions published 1974, 1978, and 1981).

Carlsmith was married to social psychologist Lyn Carlsmith (born Karolyn Gai Kuckenberg, October 7, 1932 – September 1, 2011) from 1963 until his death, and had three children: Christopher, Kimberly, and Kevin (October 17, 1967 – November 19, 2011). He graduated from Stanford University and Harvard University.

<text>High-throughput screening (HTS) is a method for scientific discovery especially used in drug discovery and relevant to the fields of biology, materials science and chemistry. Using robotics, data processing/control software, liquid handling devices, and sensitive detectors, high-throughput screening allows a researcher to quickly conduct millions of chemical, genetic, or pharmacological tests. Through this process one can quickly recognize active compounds, antibodies, or genes that modulate a particular biomolecular pathway. The results of these experiments provide starting points for drug design and for understanding the noninteraction or role of a particular location.

==Assay plate preparation==

The key labware or testing vessel of HTS is the microtiter plate, which is a small container, usually disposable and made of plastic, that features a grid of small, open divots called &quot;wells&quot;. In general, microplates for HTS have either 96, 192, 384, 1536, 3456 or 6144 wells. These are all multiples of 96, reflecting the original 96-well microplate with spaced wells of 8 x 12 with 9 mm spacing. Most of the wells contain test items, depending on the nature of the experiment. These could be different chemical compounds dissolved e.g. in an aqueous solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The wells could also contain cells or enzymes of some type. (The other wells may be empty or contain pure solvent or untreated samples, intended for use as experimental controls.)

A screening facility typically holds a library of &quot;stock plates&quot;, whose contents are carefully catalogued, and each of which may have been created by the lab or obtained from a commercial source. These stock plates themselves are not directly used in experiments; instead, separate &quot;assay plates&quot; are created as needed. An assay plate is simply a copy of a stock plate, created by pipetting a small amount of liquid (often measured in nanoliters) from the wells of a stock plate to the corresponding wells of a completely empty plate.

==Reaction observation==
To prepare for an assay, the researcher fills each well of the plate with some biological entity that they wish to conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some incubation time has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (or fail to react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate&#x27;s wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells&#x27; compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily determine by itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the value obtained from a single well. A high-capacity analysis machine can measure dozens of plates in the space of a few minutes like this, generating thousands of experimental datapoints very quickly.

Depending on the results of this first assay, the researcher can perform follow up assays within the same screen by &quot;cherrypicking&quot; liquid from the source wells that gave interesting results (known as &quot;hits&quot;) into new assay plates, and then re-running the experiment to collect further data on this narrowed set, confirming and refining observations.

==Automation systems==

Automation is an essential element in HTS&#x27;s usefulness. Typically, an integrated robot system consisting of one or more robots transports assay-microplates from station to station for sample and reagent addition, mixing, incubation, and finally readout or detection. An HTS system can usually prepare, incubate, and analyze many plates simultaneously, further speeding the data-collection process. HTS robots that can test up to 100,000 compounds per day currently exist. Automatic colony pickers pick thousands of microbial colonies for high throughput genetic screening. The term uHTS or &quot;ultra-high-throughput screening&quot; refers (circa 2008) to screening in excess of 100,000 compounds per day.

== Experimental design and data analysis ==
With the ability of rapid screening of diverse compounds (such as small molecules or siRNAs) to identify active compounds, HTS has led to an explosion in the rate of data generated in recent years
Consequently, one of the most fundamental challenges in HTS experiments is to glean biochemical significance from mounds of data, which relies on the development and adoption of appropriate experimental designs and analytic methods for both quality control and hit selection
HTS research is one of the fields that have a feature described by John Blume, Chief Science Officer for Applied Proteomics, Inc., as follows: Soon, if a scientist does not understand some statistics or rudimentary data-handling technologies, he or she may not be considered to be a true molecular biologist and, thus, will simply become &quot;a dinosaur.&quot;

=== Quality control ===
High-quality HTS assays are critical in HTS experiments. The development of high-quality HTS assays requires the integration of both experimental and computational approaches for quality control (QC). Three important means of QC are (i) good plate design, (ii) the selection of effective positive and negative chemical/biological controls, and (iii) the development of effective QC metrics to measure the degree of differentiation so that assays with inferior data quality can be identified.

A good plate design helps to identify systematic errors (especially those linked with well position) and determine what normalization should be used to remove/reduce the impact of systematic errors on both QC and hit selection.

Effective analytic QC methods serve as a gatekeeper for excellent quality assays. In a typical HTS experiment, a clear distinction between a positive control and a negative reference such as a negative control is an index for good quality. Many quality-assessment measures have been proposed to measure the degree of differentiation between a positive control and a negative reference. Signal-to-background ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, signal window, assay variability ratio, and Z-factor have been adopted to evaluate data quality.
Strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) has recently been proposed for assessing data quality in HTS assays.

=== Hit selection ===
A compound with a desired size of effects in an HTS is called a hit. The process of selecting hits is called hit selection. The analytic methods for hit selection in screens without replicates (usually in primary screens) differ from those with replicates (usually in confirmatory screens). For example, the z-score method is suitable for screens without replicates whereas the t-statistic is suitable for screens with replicates. The calculation of SSMD for screens without replicates also differs from that for screens with replicates

For hit selection in primary screens without replicates, the easily interpretable ones are average fold change, mean difference, percent inhibition, and percent activity. However, they do not capture data variability effectively. The z-score method or SSMD, which can capture data variability based on an assumption that every compound has the same variability as a negative reference in the screens.

However, outliers are common in HTS experiments, and methods such as z-score are sensitive to outliers and can be problematic. As a consequence, robust methods such as the z*-score method, SSMD*, B-score method, and quantile-based method have been proposed and adopted for hit selection.


In a screen with replicates, we can directly estimate variability for each compound; as a consequence, we should use SSMD or t-statistic that does not rely on the strong assumption that the z-score and z*-score rely on. One issue with the use of t-statistic and associated p-values is that they are affected by both sample size and effect size.
They come from testing for no mean difference, and thus are not designed to measure the size of compound effects. For hit selection, the major interest is the size of effect in a tested compound. SSMD directly assesses the size of effects.
SSMD has also been shown to be better than other commonly used effect sizes.
The population value of SSMD is comparable across experiments and, thus, we can use the same cutoff for the population value of SSMD to measure the size of compound effects

== Techniques for increased throughput and efficiency ==

Unique distributions of compounds across one or many plates can be employed either to increase the number of assays per plate or to reduce the variance of assay results, or both. The simplifying assumption made in this approach is that any N compounds in the same well will not typically interact with each other, or the assay target, in a manner that fundamentally changes the ability of the assay to detect true hits.

For example, imagine a plate wherein compound A is in wells 1–2–3, compound B is in wells 2–3–4, and compound C is in wells 3–4–5. In an assay of this plate against a given target, a hit in wells 2, 3, and 4 would indicate that compound B is the most likely agent, while also providing three measurements of compound B&#x27;s efficacy against the specified target. Commercial applications of this approach involve combinations in which no two compounds ever share more than one well, to reduce the (second-order) possibility of interference between pairs of compounds being screened.

===Recent advances===
Automation and low volume assay formats were leveraged by scientists at the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) to develop quantitative HTS (qHTS), a paradigm to pharmacologically profile large chemical libraries through the generation of full concentration-response relationships for each compound. With accompanying curve fitting and cheminformatics software qHTS data yields half maximal effective concentration (EC50), maximal response, Hill coefficient (nH) for the entire library enabling the assessment of nascent structure activity relationships (SAR).

In March 2010, research was published demonstrating an HTS process allowing 1,000 times faster screening (100 million reactions in 10 hours) at 1-millionth the cost (using 10−7 times the reagent volume) than conventional techniques using drop-based microfluidics. Drops of fluid separated by oil replace microplate wells and allow analysis and hit sorting while reagents are flowing through channels.

In 2010, researchers developed a silicon sheet of lenses that can be placed over microfluidic arrays to allow the fluorescence measurement of 64 different output channels simultaneously with a single camera. This process can analyze 200,000 drops per second.

In 2013, researchers have disclosed an approach with small molecules from plants. In general, it is essential to provide high-quality proof-of-concept validations early in the drug discovery process. Here technologies that enable the identification of potent, selective, and bioavailable chemical probes are of crucial interest, even if the resulting compounds require further optimization for development into a pharmaceutical product. Nuclear receptor RORα, a protein that has been targeted for more than a decade to identify potent and bioavailable agonists, was used as an example of a very challenging drug target. Hits are confirmed at the screening step due to the bell-shaped curve. This method is very similar to the quantitative HTS method (screening and hit confirmation at the same time), except that using this approach greatly decreases the data point number and can screen easily more than 100.000 biological relevant compounds.

Switching from an orbital shaker, which required milling times of 24 hours and at least 10 mg of drug compound to a ResonantAcoustic mixer, Merck reported reduced processing time to less than 2 hours on only 1-2 mg of drug compound per well. Merck also indicated the acoustic milling approach allows for the preparation of high dose nanosuspension formulations that could not be obtained using conventional milling equipment.

Whereby traditional HTS drug discovery uses purified proteins or intact cells, recent development of the technology is associated with the use of intact living organisms, like the nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; and zebrafish (&quot;Danio rerio&quot;).

In 2016-2018 plate manufacturers began producing specialized chemistry to allow for mass production of ultra-low adherent cell repellent surfaces which facilitated the rapid development of HTS amenable assays to address cancer drug discovery in 3D tissues such as organoids and spheroids; a more physiologically relevant format.

==Increasing use of HTS in academia for biomedical research==
HTS is a relatively recent innovation, made feasible largely through modern advances in robotics and high-speed computer technology. It still takes a highly specialized and expensive screening lab to run an HTS operation, so in many cases a small- to moderate-size research institution will use the services of an existing HTS facility rather than set up one for itself.

There is a trend in academia for universities to be their own drug discovery enterprise. These facilities, which normally are found only in industry, are now increasingly found at universities as well. UCLA, for example, features an open access HTS laboratory Molecular Screening Shared Resources (MSSR, UCLA), which can screen more than 100,000 compounds a day on a routine basis. The open access policy ensures that researchers from all over the world can take advantage of this facility without lengthy intellectual property negotiations. With a compound library of over 200,000 small molecules, the MSSR has one of the largest compound deck of all universities on the west coast. Also, the MSSR features full functional genomics capabilities (genome wide siRNA, shRNA, cDNA and CRISPR) which are complementary to small molecule efforts: Functional genomics leverages HTS capabilities to execute genome wide screens which examine the function of each gene in the context of interest by either knocking each gene out or overexpressing it. Parallel access to high-throughput small molecule screen and a genome wide screen enables researchers to perform target identification and validation for given disease or the mode of action determination on a small molecule. The most accurate results can be obtained by use of &quot;arrayed&quot; functional genomics libraries, i.e. each library contains a single construct such as a single siRNA or cDNA. Functional genomics is typically paired with high content screening using e.g. epifluorescent microscopy or laser scanning cytometry.

The University of Illinois also has a facility for HTS, as does the University of Minnesota. The Life Sciences Institute at the University of Michigan houses the HTS facility in the Center for Chemical Genomics. Columbia University has an HTS shared resource facility with ~300,000 diverse small molecules and ~10,000 known bioactive compounds available for biochemical, cell-based and NGS-based screening. The Rockefeller University has an open-access HTS Resource Center HTSRC (The Rockefeller University, HTSRC), which offers a library of over 380,000 compounds. Northwestern University&#x27;s High Throughput Analysis Laboratory supports target identification, validation, assay development, and compound screening. The non-profit Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute also has a long-standing HTS facility in the Conrad Prebys Center for Chemical Genomics which was part of the MLPCN. The non-profit Scripps Research Molecular Screening Center (SRMSC) continues to serve academia across institutes post-MLPCN era. The SRMSC uHTS facility maintains one of the largest library collections in academia, presently at well-over 665,000 small molecule entities, and routinely screens the full collection or sub-libraries in support of multi-PI grant initiatives.

In the United States, the National Institutes of Health or NIH has created a nationwide consortium of small-molecule screening centers to produce innovative chemical tools for use in biological research. The Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, or MLPCN, performs HTS on assays provided by the research community, against a large library of small molecules maintained in a central molecule repository. In addition, the NIH created the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences or NCATS, housed in Shady Grove Maryland, that carries out small molecule and RNAi screens in collaboration with academic laboratories. Of note, the small molecule screening uses 1536 well plates, a capability rarely seen in academic screening laboratories that allows one to carry out quantitative HTS in which each compound is tested across four- to five-orders of magnitude of concentrations.

<doc id="882736" wikidata="Q214996" url="?curid=882736" title="Project Gemini">
<text>Project Gemini () was the second United States human spaceflight program to fly. Conducted after the first American crewed space program, Project Mercury, while the Apollo program was still in early development, Gemini was conceived in 1961 and concluded in 1966. The Gemini spacecraft carried a two-astronaut crew. Ten Gemini crews and 16 individual astronauts flew low Earth orbit (LEO) missions during 1965 and 1966.

Gemini&#x27;s objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon. In doing so, it allowed the United States to catch up and overcome the lead in human spaceflight capability the Soviet Union had obtained in the early years of the Space Race, by demonstrating mission endurance up to just under 14 days, longer than the eight days required for a round trip to the Moon; methods of performing extravehicular activity (EVA) without tiring; and the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve rendezvous and docking with another spacecraft. This left Apollo free to pursue its prime mission without spending time developing these techniques.

All Gemini flights were launched from Launch Complex 19 (LC-19) at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station in Florida. Their launch vehicle was the Titan II GLV, a modified intercontinental ballistic missile. Gemini was the first program to use the newly built Mission Control Center at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center for flight control. The project also used the Agena target vehicle, a modified Atlas-Agena upper stage, used to develop and practice orbital rendezvous and docking techniques. 

The astronaut corps that supported Project Gemini included the &quot;Mercury Seven&quot;, &quot;The New Nine&quot;, and &quot;The Fourteen&quot;. During the program, three astronauts died in air crashes during training, including both members of the prime crew for Gemini 9. The backup crew flew this mission.

Gemini was robust enough that the United States Air Force planned to use it for the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) program, which was later canceled. Gemini&#x27;s chief designer, Jim Chamberlin, also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late 1961. He believed Gemini spacecraft could fly in lunar operations before Project Apollo, and cost less. NASA&#x27;s administration did not approve those plans. In 1969, Lukas Bingham proposed a &quot;Big Gemini&quot; that could have been used to shuttle up to 12 astronauts to the planned space stations in the Apollo Applications Project (AAP). The only AAP project funded was Skylab (The first American space station) – which used existing spacecraft and hardware – thereby eliminating the need for Big Gemini.

==Pronunciation==
The constellation for which the project was named is commonly pronounced , the last syllable rhyming with &quot;eye&quot;. However, staff of the Manned Spacecraft Center, including the astronauts, tended to pronounce the name , rhyming with &quot;knee&quot;. NASA&#x27;s public affairs office then issued a statement in 1965 declaring &quot;Jeh&#x27;-mih-nee&quot; the &quot;official&quot; pronunciation. Gus Grissom, acting as Houston capsule communicator when Ed White performed his spacewalk on Gemini 4, is heard on flight recordings pronouncing the spacecraft&#x27;s call sign &quot;Jeh-mih-nee 4&quot;, and the NASA pronunciation is used in the 2018 film &quot;First Man&quot;.

==Program origins and objectives==
The Apollo program was conceived in early 1960 as a three-man spacecraft to follow Project Mercury. Jim Chamberlin, the head of engineering at the Space Task Group (STG), was assigned in February 1961 to start working on a bridge program between Mercury and Apollo. He presented two initial versions of a two-man spacecraft, then designated Mercury Mark II, at a NASA retreat at Wallops Island in March 1961. Scale models were shown in July 1961 at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s offices in St. Louis.

After Apollo was chartered to land men on the Moon by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961, it became evident to NASA officials that a follow-on to the Mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of Apollo. NASA approved the two-man / two-vehicle program rechristened Project Gemini (Latin for &quot;twins&quot;), in reference to the third constellation of the Zodiac with its twin stars Castor and Pollux, on December 7, 1961. McDonnell Aircraft was contracted to build it on December 22, 1961. The program was publicly announced on January 3, 1962, with these major objectives:
* To demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods, at least eight days required for a Moon landing, to a maximum of two weeks
* To effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle, and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle
* To demonstrate Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), or space-&quot;walks&quot; outside the protection of the spacecraft, and to evaluate the astronauts&#x27; ability to perform tasks there
* To perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a pre-selected location on land

==Team==
Chamberlin designed the Gemini capsule, which carried a crew of two. He was previously the chief aerodynamicist on Avro Canada&#x27;s CF-105 Arrow fighter interceptor program. Chamberlin joined NASA along with 25 senior Avro engineers after cancellation of the Canadian Arrow program, and became head of the U.S. Space Task Group&#x27;s engineering division in charge of Gemini. The prime contractor was McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, which was also the prime contractor for the Project Mercury capsule.

Astronaut Gus Grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the Gemini spacecraft. What other Mercury astronauts dubbed &quot;Gusmobile&quot; was so designed around Grissom&#x27;s 5&#x27;6&quot; body that, when NASA discovered in 1963 that 14 of 16 astronauts would not fit in the spacecraft, the interior had to be redesigned. Grissom wrote in his posthumous 1968 book &quot;Gemini!&quot; that the realization of Project Mercury&#x27;s end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all his efforts on the upcoming Gemini program.

The Gemini program was managed by the Manned Spacecraft Center, located in Houston, Texas, under direction of the Office of Manned Space Flight, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Dr. George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator of NASA for Manned Space Flight, served as acting director of the Gemini program. William C. Schneider, Deputy Director of Manned Space Flight for Mission Operations served as mission director on all Gemini flights beginning with Gemini 6A.

Guenter Wendt was a McDonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the Mercury and Gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the Apollo program launched crews. His team was responsible for completion of the complex pad close-out procedures just prior to spacecraft launch, and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch. The astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over, and responsibility for, the condition of the spacecraft and developed a good-humored rapport with him.

==Spacecraft==
NASA selected McDonnell Aircraft, which had been the prime contractor for the Project Mercury capsule, in 1961 to build the Gemini capsule, the first of which was delivered in 1963. The spacecraft was long and wide, with a launch weight varying from .

The Gemini crew capsule (referred to as the Reentry Module) was essentially an enlarged version of the Mercury capsule. Unlike Mercury, the retrorockets, electrical power, propulsion systems, oxygen, and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module which would burn up on reentry. A major design improvement in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components, which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary, without removing or disturbing other already tested components.

===Reentry module===
Many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors. Unlike Mercury, Gemini used completely solid-state electronics, and its modular design made it easy to repair.

Gemini&#x27;s emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the Titan II&#x27;s hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return to Earth inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.

The main proponent of using ejection seats was Chamberlin, who had never liked the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight. He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures, which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion, thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats.


Maxime Faget, the designer of the Mercury LES, was on the other hand less-than-enthusiastic about this setup. Aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts, they would also only be usable for about 40 seconds after liftoff, by which point the booster would be attaining Mach 1 speed and ejection would no longer be possible. He was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the Titan&#x27;s exhaust plume if they ejected in-flight and later added, &quot;The best thing about Gemini was that they never had to make an escape.&quot;

The Gemini ejection system was never tested with the Gemini cabin pressurized with pure oxygen, as it was prior to launch. In January 1967, the fatal Apollo 1 fire demonstrated that pressurizing a spacecraft with pure oxygen created an extremely dangerous fire hazard. In a 1997 oral history, astronaut Thomas P. Stafford commented on the Gemini 6 launch abort in December 1965, when he and command pilot Wally Schirra nearly ejected from the spacecraft:

Gemini was the first astronaut-carrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer, the Gemini Guidance Computer, to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers. This computer, sometimes called the Gemini Spacecraft On-Board Computer (OBC), was very similar to the Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer. The Gemini Guidance Computer weighed . Its core memory had 4096 addresses, each containing a 39-bit word composed of three 13-bit &quot;syllables&quot;. All numeric data was 26-bit two&#x27;s-complement integers (sometimes used as fixed-point numbers), either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator. Instructions (always with a 4-bit opcode and 9 bits of operand) could go in any syllable.

Unlike Mercury, Gemini used in-flight radar and an artificial horizon, similar to those used in the aviation industry. Like Mercury, Gemini used a joystick to give the astronauts manual control of yaw, pitch, and roll. Gemini added control of the spacecraft&#x27;s translation (forward, backward, up, down, and sideways) with a pair of T-shaped handles (one for each crew member). Translation control enabled rendezvous and docking, and crew control of the flight path. The same controller types were also used in the Apollo spacecraft.
The original intention for Gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea, using a Rogallo wing rather than a parachute, with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft. To facilitate this, the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft, but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield. This cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches. This design was ultimately dropped, and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in Mercury. The capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal, so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first. This eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the Mercury capsule.

===Adapter module===
The adapter module in turn was separated into a Retro module and an Equipment module.

====Retro module====
The Retro module contained four solid-fuel TE-M-385 Star-13E retrorockets, each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle, which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module, crossing at right angles in the center. Re-entry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time. Abort procedures at certain periods during lift-off would cause them to fire at the same time, thrusting the Descent module away from the Titan rocket.

====Equipment module====
Gemini was equipped with an Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS), containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes (forward/backward, left/right, up/down), in addition to attitude control (pitch, yaw, and roll angle orientation) as in Mercury. Translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude, necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft, and docking with the Agena Target Vehicle (ATV), with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes.

Early short-duration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries; later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in crewed spacecraft.

Gemini was in some regards more advanced than Apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier. It became known as a &quot;pilot&#x27;s spacecraft&quot; due to its assortment of jet fighter-like features, in no small part due to Gus Grissom&#x27;s influence over the design, and it was at this point where the US crewed space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the Soviet Union with long duration flight, rendezvous, and extravehicular capability. The Soviet Union during this period was developing the Soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the Moon, but political and technical problems began to get in the way, leading to the ultimate end of their crewed lunar program.

==Launch vehicle==

The Titan II debuted in 1962 as the Air Force&#x27;s second-generation ICBM to replace the Atlas. By using hypergolic fuels, it could be stored longer and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components. The only caveat was the propellant mix (nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine) were extremely toxic compared to the Atlas&#x27; liquid oxygen/RP-1. However, the Titan had considerable difficulty being man-rated due to early problems with pogo oscillation. The launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from Cape Kennedy.

==Astronauts==
Deke Slayton, as director of flight crew operations, had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the Gemini program. Each flight had a primary crew and backup crew, and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later. Slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the Mercury Seven: Alan Shepard, Grissom, Cooper, and Schirra. (John Glenn had retired from NASA in January 1964 and Scott Carpenter, who was blamed by some in NASA management for the problematic reentry of &quot;Aurora 7&quot;, was on leave to participate in the Navy&#x27;s SEALAB project and was grounded from flight in July 1964 due to an arm injury sustained in a motorbike accident. Slayton himself continued to be grounded due to a heart problem.) As for Shepard, during training on the Gemini Project, his inner ear deficiency due to Menière&#x27;s Disease would effectively ground him as well and keep him removed from the flight roster until he underwent corrective surgery and would not fly on Gemini at all, but return to flight with Apollo 14 as Commander.

Titles used for the left-hand (command) and right-hand (pilot) seat crew positions were taken from the U.S. Air Force pilot ratings, &quot;Command Pilot&quot; and &quot;Pilot&quot;. Sixteen astronauts flew on 10 crewed Gemini missions:

===Crew selection===
In late 1963, Slayton selected Shepard and Stafford for Gemini 3, McDivitt and White for Gemini 4, and Schirra and Young for Gemini 5 (which was to be the first Agena rendezvous mission). The backup crew for Gemini 3 was Grissom and Borman, who were also slated for Gemini 6, to be the first long-duration mission. Finally Conrad and Lovell were assigned as the backup crew for Gemini 4.

Delays in the production of the Agena Target Vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation. The Schirra and Young mission was bumped to Gemini 6 and they became the backup crew for Shepard and Stafford. Grissom and Borman then had their long-duration mission assigned to Gemini 5.

The second rearrangement occurred when Shepard developed Ménière&#x27;s disease, an inner ear problem. Grissom was then moved to command Gemini 3. Slayton felt that Young was a better personality match with Grissom and switched Stafford and Young. Finally, Slayton tapped Cooper to command the long-duration Gemini 5. Again for reasons of compatibility, he moved Conrad from backup commander of Gemini 4 to pilot of Gemini 5, and Borman to backup command of Gemini 4. Finally he assigned Armstrong and Elliot See to be the backup crew for Gemini 5.
The third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when Slayton felt that See wasn&#x27;t up to the physical demands of EVA on Gemini 8. He reassigned See to be the prime commander of Gemini 9 and put Scott as pilot of Gemini 8 and Charles Bassett as the pilot of Gemini 9.

The fourth and final rearrangement of the Gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of See and Bassett when their trainer jet crashed, coincidentally into a McDonnell building which held their Gemini 9 capsule in St. Louis. The backup crew of Stafford and Cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of Gemini 9A. Lovell and Aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of Gemini 10 to be the backup crew of Gemini 9. This cleared the way through the crew rotation for Lovell and Aldrin to become the prime crew of Gemini 12.

Along with the deaths of Grissom, White, and Roger Chaffee in the fire of Apollo 1, this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven Apollo crews, and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the Moon.

==Missions==

In April 1964 and January 1965, two Gemini missions were flown without crews to test systems and the heat shield. These were followed by 10 flights with crews in 1965 and 1966. All were launched by Titan II launch vehicles. Some highlights from the Gemini program:
* Gemini 3 (Grissom and Young) was the first crewed Gemini mission, first multi-crewed US mission, and the first crewed spacecraft to use thrusters to change its orbit.
* On Gemini 4, Ed White became the first American to make an extravehicular activity (EVA, or &quot;spacewalk&quot;) on June 3, 1965.
*Gemini 5 (August 21–29, 1965) demonstrated the 8-day endurance necessary for an Apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power.
*Gemini 6A accomplished the first space rendezvous with its sister craft Gemini 7 in December 1965, with Gemini 7 setting a 14-day endurance record for its flight.
*Gemini 8 achieved the first space docking with an uncrewed Agena target vehicle.
*Gemini 10 established that radiation at high altitude was not a problem, further demonstrated the ability to rendezvous with a passive object, and was the first Gemini mission to fire the Agena&#x27;s own rocket. Michael Collins would be the first person to meet another spacecraft in orbit, during his second successful EVA.
*Gemini 11 first direct-ascent (first orbit) rendezvous with an Agena Target Vehicle, docking with it 1 hour 34 minutes after launch. Set a crewed Earth orbital altitude record of in September 1966, using the Agena target vehicle&#x27;s propulsion system. This record was broken in September 2024 by the Polaris Dawn mission.
*On Gemini 12, Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin became the first space traveler to prove that useful work (EVA) could be done outside a spacecraft without life-threatening exhaustion, due to newly implemented footholds, handholds, and scheduled rest periods.

Rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another, the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to go to a lower orbit first and which increases relative speed, and then approach the target spacecraft from below and decrease orbital speed to meet it. To practice these maneuvers, special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.

==Gemini-Titan launches and serial numbers==

The Gemini-Titan II launch vehicle was adapted by NASA from the U.S. Air Force Titan II ICBM. (Similarly, the Mercury-Atlas launch vehicle had been adapted from the USAF Atlas missile.) The Gemini-Titan II rockets were assigned Air Force serial numbers, which were painted in four places on each Titan II (on opposite sides on each of the first and second stages). USAF crews maintained Launch Complex 19 and prepared and launched all of the Gemini-Titan II launch vehicles. Data and experience operating the Titans was of value to both the U.S. Air Force and NASA.

The USAF serial numbers assigned to the Gemini-Titan launch vehicles are given in the tables above. Fifteen Titan IIs were ordered in 1962 so the serial is &quot;62-12XXX&quot;, but only &quot;12XXX&quot; is painted on the Titan II. The order for the last three of the 15 launch vehicles was canceled on July 30, 1964, and they were never built. Serial numbers were, however, assigned to them prospectively: &quot;12568&quot; - GLV-13; &quot;12569&quot; - GLV-14; and &quot;12570&quot; - GLV-15.

==Program cost==
From 1962 to 1967, Gemini cost $1.3 billion in 1967 dollars ($ in ). In January 1969, a NASA report to the US Congress estimating the costs for Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo (through the first crewed Moon landing) included $1.2834 billion for Gemini: $797.4 million for spacecraft, $409.8 million for launch vehicles, and $76.2 million for support.

==Proposed extensions and applications==

===Advanced Gemini===
McDonnell Aircraft, the main contractor for Mercury and Gemini, was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for Apollo, but lost out to North American Aviation. McDonnell later sought to extend the Gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a crewed lunar landing earlier and at less cost than Apollo, but these proposals were rejected by NASA.

A range of applications were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the Agena Target Vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from crewed lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.

Some of the Advanced Gemini proposals used &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; Gemini spacecraft, unmodified from the original program, while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew, dock with space stations, visit the Moon, and perform other mission objectives. Other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft, in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing.

===Big Gemini===
Big Gemini (or &quot;Big G&quot;) was another proposal by McDonnell Douglas made in August 1969. It was intended to provide large-capacity, all-purpose access to space, including missions that ultimately used Apollo or the Space Shuttle.

The study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from Gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station. Land-landing at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements. Two baseline spacecraft were defined: a nine-man minimum modification version of the Gemini B called Min-Mod Big G and a 12-man advanced concept, having the same exterior geometry but with new, state-of-the-art subsystems, called Advanced Big G. Three launch vehicles-Saturn IB, Titan IIIM, and Saturn INT-20 (S-IC/S-IVB) were investigated for use with the spacecraft.

===Military applications===
The Air Force had an interest in the Gemini system, and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the Manned Orbital Laboratory. To this end, the Gemini 2 spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the MOL, sent into space by a Titan IIIC. This was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice.

The USAF also thought of adapting the Gemini spacecraft for military applications, such as crude observation of the ground (no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried) and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites. This project was called Blue Gemini. The USAF did not like the fact that Gemini would have to be recovered by the US Navy, so they intended for Blue Gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids, carried over from the original design of Gemini.

At first some within NASA welcomed sharing of the cost with the USAF, but it was later agreed that NASA was better off operating Gemini by itself. Blue Gemini was canceled in 1963 by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who decided the NASA Gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments. MOL was canceled by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird in 1969, when it was determined that uncrewed spy satellites could perform the same functions much more cost-effectively.

==In media==
* Two Gemini capsules (codenamed &quot;Jupiter&quot; instead of &quot;Gemini&quot;) are featured in the plot of the 1967 &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.
* A modified one-person Gemini capsule is used to send an astronaut (played by James Caan) to the Moon in the 1968 film &quot;Countdown&quot;.
* Gemini missions 4, 8 and 12 feature in the first episode of the HBO series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&#x27;
*Like other US space programs, Gemini was covered in the 1985 PBS series &quot;Spaceflight&quot;
* Some aspects of the Gemini program relating to astronaut Neil Armstrong were touched upon in the 2018 film &quot;First Man&quot;.
* Many episodes of the television show &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; featured launch pad and launch footage of various Gemini missions.
* Gemini, is a layer 7 telecom standard named after the Gemini missions. Its non-standard port number, 1965, is a reference to the first mission date.

<text>Darius LaVar Miles (born October 9, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player.

The , forward was selected directly out of high school by the Los Angeles Clippers with the third overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft. He was a First Team NBA All-Rookie in 2001, a first for a prep-to-pro player.

Miles&#x27; playing career nearly came to an end when he was released by the Portland Trail Blazers in April 2008 after two years away from the court following microfracture surgery on his right knee. He returned to action during the 2008–09 season as a member of the Memphis Grizzlies.

==Early life==
Miles was born in Belleville, Illinois and attended East St. Louis Lincoln High School and East St. Louis Senior High School in East St. Louis, Illinois. Before declaring to enter the 2000 NBA draft, Miles had signed a National Letter of Intent to play for the St. John&#x27;s Red Storm men&#x27;s basketball team, alongside fellow top recruit Omar Cook. Mike Jarvis, the head coach for the Red Storm at the time, has stated that Miles&#x27; commitment significantly helped obtain Cook and the other incoming freshmen from the recruiting class.

==Professional career==

=== Los Angeles Clippers (2000–2002) ===
Miles entered the 2000 NBA draft and was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers as the third overall pick, at the time the highest a player had been drafted directly from high school. His debut game was played on October 31, 2000, in a 94–107 loss to the Utah Jazz where he recorded eight points, seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks.

For the next two seasons Miles, Quentin Richardson, Corey Maggette, Lamar Odom and Elton Brand entertained fans with their exciting, high flying style of play. He played his first two seasons with the Clippers, earning an NBA All-Rookie Team first team honor in 2001. In those years Miles, Richardson, and others helped the Clippers improve their performance from 15 wins in 99–00, to 31 wins in 00–01 to finally 39 wins in 01–02. In the 2001–02 season, the Clippers appeared to be on the verge of their first playoff appearance since 1997; however, they were only able to win three of the last 12 games of the season, ultimately finishing five games out of the playoffs.

=== Cleveland Cavaliers (2002–2004) ===
Following the 2001–2002 season, Miles was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, alongside Harold Jamison, in a deal for Andre Miller and Bryant Stith where he spent a season and a half before being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Jeff McInnis and Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje midway through the 2003–04 season.

=== Portland Trail Blazers (2004–2008) ===
During the 2004–05 season, Miles made headlines after a confrontation with then-coach Maurice Cheeks in which Miles reportedly insulted Cheeks with racial slurs and remarked he &quot;did not care if the team were to lose the next 20 games&quot; since Cheeks was &quot;going to be fired anyway&quot;. According to ESPN&#x27;s Chad Ford and other accounts, after Cheeks asked Miles to leave, Miles&#x27; response was &quot;Make me.&quot; When Cheeks left the room to see Blazers&#x27; general manager John Nash, Miles ran behind him shouting, &quot;That&#x27;s right, run to your daddy.&quot;
On April 19, 2005, he scored a career-high 47 points in a loss against the Denver Nuggets, which equaled the eighth-highest single-game output in franchise history up to that point.

Late in the 2005–2006 season, Miles severely injured his right knee. Five days later, on April 15, 2006, he played in his 40th and last game of the season. He missed the entire 2006–07 and 2007–08 NBA seasons due to microfracture surgery to repair his injury.

In an effort to shed Miles&#x27;s $18 million contract, the Portland Trail Blazers petitioned the NBA and the NBA Players Association in March 2008 to provide an independent doctor to decide whether Miles could play again. The examination determined that Miles&#x27; knee injury was severe enough to be career-ending, prompting the Blazers to request waivers for his release on April 14, 2008. However, Miles had the option to sign on with another team if offered a contract, potentially reverting the $18 million savings the Blazers hoped to gain if Miles played in 10 games in 2008.

Complicating matters was a 10-game suspension for violating the league&#x27;s substance abuse policy levied by the NBA, which Miles was required to serve before he could play for any NBA team.

=== Memphis Grizzlies (2008–2009) ===
On August 22, 2008, the Celtics signed Miles to a non-guaranteed contract offering him a chance to earn a roster spot at training camp. Though he worked out twice with the team and impressed with his health and attitude, he was waived on October 20, before the regular season started.

On December 13, 2008, Miles signed with the Memphis Grizzlies. After sitting out his ten-game suspension, Miles made his season debut with the team on January 4, 2009, playing the last 1:46 in a 102–82 win against the Dallas Mavericks. On January 7, after collecting only two rebounds and two blocks in nine minutes over two games, Miles was waived. On January 9, following a controversy over his re-signing, the Grizzlies signed Miles to a 10-day contract. The next game, against the Cavaliers on January 14, Miles played 14 minutes and exhibited some of the quickness and leaping ability he once possessed. He recorded 13 points on 4 of 6 shooting and making 5 of 7 free throws in a 102–87 loss. On January 30, 2009, the Grizzlies signed Miles for the rest of the 2008–09 season.

On July 9, 2009, the Grizzlies renounced their rights on Miles in order to save cap room.

====Career-ending injury controversy====
Under NBA rules, if a team is granted salary-cap relief for a career-ending injury to a player who thereafter participates in at least ten games the next season, the salary cap relief is terminated, and the amount is added back to the team&#x27;s salary cap ceiling.

On January 8, 2009, after Miles played six pre-season games with the Celtics and two before being released from a non-guaranteed contract by the Grizzlies, the Portland Trail Blazers threatened to sue any of the other 29 NBA teams that picked up Miles and played him specifically to adversely impact their salary cap and tax positions. In response, the NBA Players Association threatened to file a grievance against the Trail Blazers. After a directive from the NBA Commissioner&#x27;s office the next day declaring that any team could sign Miles and the League would approve the contract, the Memphis Grizzlies re-signed Miles on January 10, 2009, to a 10-day non-guaranteed contract. Miles then played the two games necessary to trigger re-addition of the $18 million to Portland&#x27;s cap amount. Miles then re-signed two more 10-day contracts with the Grizzlies before being signed for the rest of the 2008–09 season on January 30, 2009.

Miles&#x27; final NBA game was played on April 13, 2009, in a 110–119 loss to the Phoenix Suns in which he recorded two points, two rebounds and an assist in six and one-half minutes of playing time.

==Acting career==
Miles had a role in &quot;The Perfect Score&quot; (2004), as a high school basketball star who needs to achieve a qualifying SAT score to attend St. John&#x27;s University, closely paralleling his real-life situation coming out of high school. He also appeared in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Van Wilder&quot; (2002), along with then-Clipper teammates Michael Olowokandi and Quentin Richardson. He also appeared in a documentary titled &quot;The Youngest Guns&quot; (2004), which detailed Miles&#x27; and Richardson&#x27;s first few years in the NBA.

Since February 2019 he has co-hosted &quot;The Knuckleheads&quot; podcast with Quentin Richardson associated with &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot;. On the podcast, Miles and Richardson interview former and current professional basketball players from the perspective of ex-NBA players.

<doc id="882790" wikidata="Q125139" url="?curid=882790" title="Benjamin Sheares">
<text>Benjamin Henry Sheares (12 August 1907 – 12 May 1981) was a Singaporean physician and academic who served as the second president of Singapore from 1971 until his death in 1981.
Of Eurasian descent, Sheares was born in Singapore under British rule and graduated from the King Edward VII College of Medicine. He studied obstetrics and gynaecology and worked as an obstetrician at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH), eventually serving as the Acting Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Malaya in Singapore. He later became the Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the university, a rare feat for a local as usually high-ranking colonial officers held such positions.

Sheares retired in 1960 and was in private practice before being elected as the president of Singapore by Parliament following the death of Yusof Ishak, the incumbent president, on 23 November 1970. Sheares was sworn in on 2 January 1971 following a unanimous agreement by Parliament and served as the president of Singapore for three terms, from 2 January 1971 till his death in office on 12 May 1981. He was succeeded by Devan Nair on 23 October 1981. During his presidency, he officiated multiple events and ceremonies such as the 1971 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the 7th South East Asian Peninsular Games.

Regarded as &quot;the father of obstetrics and gynaecology in Singapore&quot;, Sheares was known for standardising the lower Caesarian section in Singapore and creating an artificial vagina. The lower Caesarian section has since become the standard procedure in Singapore whilst his method to create an artificial vagina has been dubbed the Sheares operation and is used to help women suffering from Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome. Sheares remains the only president to have been elected for three terms. Both the Benjamin Sheares Bridge and Sheares Hall at the National University of Singapore are named after him.

==Early life and education==

Sheares was born on 12 August 1907 in Singapore, Straits Settlements to an Eurasian family with an English lineage. He was the second of six children to his father Edwin Henry Sheares (1863–1940), an English technical supervisor of the Public Works Department, and his mother Lilian Jane Sheares (1880–1971; &quot;née&quot; Gómez), a Singapore-born woman of Chinese and Spanish descent.

Known affectionally as Ben or Bennie when he was younger, Sheares showed ambition to become a doctor – a dream deemed almost impossible for someone who was Asian and came from a poor family in the early colonial days of Singapore. However, his sister Alice encouraged him to follow his dream against his mother&#x27;s wishes for her son to take up a job as a clerk and start helping out with the family bills as soon as he completed his Senior Cambridge Examinations (present-day GCE Ordinary Level).

Sheares was educated at Methodist Girls&#x27; School, when it was co-ed, and Saint Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School before transferring in 1922 to study at Raffles Institution, the only school equipped with scientific laboratories – making it an ideal place to further his ambition to become a doctor. In 1923, he enrolled into the King Edward VII College of Medicine (now the National University of Singapore) to begin his medical training. Sheares was aware that his family could not see him through the school fees afforded by the college, therefore he won a generous scholarship offered by the Council of the Medical College with his exemplary academic performance. With this scholarship, he was able to give $50 monthly to his mother for the support of his family.

== Medical career ==

Upon his graduation in March 1929, he served as an assistant medical doctor at Sepoy Lines General Hospital (present-day Singapore General Hospital) before specialising in and becoming an obstetrician at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH) in April 1931. Sheares was also the first local to become an obstetrician. By 1937, Sheares had become responsible for all obstetric patients at KKH. In 1940, Sheares was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Fellowship which would have granted him a two-year postgraduate training in Britain. However, his studies were postponed due to the Second World War. During the war in 1941, whilst working at KKH, it was damaged by the bombing from the Japanese military and it was converted into an emergency general hospital for injured civilians. Later during the Japanese occupation, Sheares served as head of department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Medical Superintendent for the local patients section of the hospital.

After the war, Sheares was appointed as the Acting Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Malaya in Singapore (present-day National University of Singapore), which he held onto until May 1947 when he went to London for his postgraduate studies at London University to get a degree of Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG) in January 1948. He had planned to take an examination at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh to join the Fellowship of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons but returned to Singapore after being called by then-Governor of Singapore Franklin Gimson to return to his post as Acting Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology as the previous Professor had retired.

Upon his arrival back to Singapore, he was appointed the Acting Professor and the job of Professor was advertised in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;. Sheares faced prejudice as despite serving as the Acting Professor for two years prior, the role of Professor was not given to him as he was a local and high-ranking colonials usually held such positions. He needed two referrals but neither his previous boss nor the Principal Medical Officer gave him references. Sheares eventually got his referrals from the Chairman of the Board of Examiners, who had previously examined him for his MRCOG, and the professor at Royal Postgraduate Medical School in Hammersmith. With these referrals, Sheares met with the Selection Board in London and, in January 1950, became the first local Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Malaya in Singapore. In December 1951, Sheares used the remainder of his Queen&#x27;s Fellowship study to go to the United States for a year. During this period, he studied at different teaching institutions in the United States, such as Mayo Clinic.

From 1953 to 1955, Sheares helped design new additions to the KKH building such as the out-patient department and the front block of the hospital, stating that, &quot;[KKH] was initially just a maternity hospital and I had to design the new buildings in such a way that the maternity operating theatres were in a different block from the gynaecological operating theatres.&quot; In 1955, Sheares became the first Singaporean to be awarded a fellowship by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, following his contributions to the sector. In 1959, Sheares advocated for voluntary sterilisation as a way to reduce population growth instead of legalising abortion, which he garnered criticism for. Sheares explained that even if abortions were made legal, people would still perform abortions illegally. He later stated that he believed that his critics assumed he was advocating for forced sterilisation, when he was really advocating for voluntary sterilisation, further saying, &quot;they also did not understand the consequences of letting the population grow un-checked.&quot; Sheares retired in June 1960 from the National University of Singapore as he was suffering from health complications such as gastric ulcers. He went into private practice and worked at a clinic at Battery Road. He had been serving as a Honorary Consultant at KKH after his retirement. In June 1970, he and Albert Winsemius were given the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters at the National University of Singapore.

=== Notable contributions ===
Regarded as &quot;the father of obstetrics and gynaecology in Singapore&quot;, contributions by Sheares to obstetrics include the lower Caesarian section, which he standardised, that resulted in a lower mortality and morbidity rate in pregnant women than the upper Caesarian section. Initially, very few Caesarian sections were carried out in Singapore and, when they were, used the upper Caesarian section which was the established method at that time. Despite this, the upper Caesarian section was not used much as it had a high risk of damaging the uterine scar at the woman&#x27;s next pregnancy. Sheares knew that the lower Caesarian section would be more effective but was unable to perform it under the previous Professor, J. S. English.

During the Japanese occupation, Sheares became the head of department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at KKH. This allowed him to perform the first lower Caesarian section in Singapore which eventually became the standard routine. Sheares also created a technique to make an artificial vagina for those born without one. This gained him worldwide recognition after he published the method in a 1960 paper titled &quot;Congenital Atresia of the Vagina: A New Technique for Tunnelling the Space Between Bladder and Rectum and Construction of the New Vagina&quot;. The technique became known as the Sheares operation and is used to help women suffering from Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome, also known as vaginal agenesis.

==Presidency==

=== Presidential elections ===
==== 1970 presidential election ====

Following the death of incumbent president Yusof Ishak, six people – Yeoh Ghim Seng, Othman Wok, Wee Chong Jin, Ismail bin Abdul, Punch Coomaraswamy, and A. P. Rajah – were considered to be the most likely candidates for the role in November 1970, given that the president was elected on by Parliament instead of by popular vote. At the 1970 presidential election, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew nominated Sheares to become president and he became the second president of Singapore on 2 January 1971 after he was sworn in, following a unanimous agreement by Parliament. His mother was 91 years old when she learnt that her son had become the president of Singapore. Just two weeks before she died, she said &quot;God has blessed Bennie especially after the way he looked after us and me.&quot;

Speculation on why Sheares was chosen to become the president include that he was non-partisan, as he was not a part of any political party, or that he was from a minority race in Singapore, to show the equality in the then-mostly Chinese dominated government. The &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; stated in a 1971 issue that Sheares was largely chosen due to his profession and success, along with showing diversity in the government. After the 1959 general election, where the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) won in a landslide victory, the PAP was critical of the medical profession and the university due to their &quot;flaccid anti-colonialism&quot;. Sheares&#x27; appointment to the presidency served as a symbol of unity between the government and academics.

==== 1974 presidential election ====
At the 1974 presidential election, Sheares was nominated by Lee again to continue serving as the president, delivering a motion that Sheares had shown, &quot;courage from tenacity&quot; and had &quot;carried his office with unassuming dignity, application, and self-discipline&quot;. Following this motion, Sheares received a unanimous agreement by Parliament and was elected to serve a second term.

==== 1978 presidential election ====
After his second term, Sheares had originally planned to retire as he felt that he did not have the energy for another term. However, Lee persuaded him and Sheares, then aged 71, participated in the 1978 presidential election. Lee held a motion in Parliament for Sheares&#x27; re-election to the office, stating that Sheares, &quot;undertakes his social and protocol functions with conscientious interest, never treating them as perfunctory chores.&quot;

This received unanimous support from Parliament and Sheares was elected to a third term. This also made Sheares the first president to serve three terms. Upon his re-election, Sheares received praise for his service to the presidency from Members of Parliament Yeo Choo Kok, Sidek bin Saniff, and Ang Kok Peng.

=== Activities during presidency ===
During his first term in 1971, he was appointed Chancellor of the National University of Singapore and he served in that role till 1981. That same year, Sheares opened the 1971 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, holding dinners and tours for the representatives. In July 1971, Sheares awarded the first Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarships, the second highest scholarship award to the President&#x27;s Scholar. In October 1971, Sheares opened the Sentosa Satellite Earth Station, the first site in Singapore to use satellites to communication. Later that month, following the British&#x27;s announcement that they will withdraw their troops from Singapore in August, Sheares attended a dinner in honour of the British&#x27;s role in Singapore alongside other Parliament members. The following year, Sheares spoke on the importance of maintaining relations with the British. In February 1972, Sheares hosted a 3-day visit for Queen Elizabeth II and her family&#x27;s visit to Singapore. He was awarded the Honorary Knight Grand Cross of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath and gave the Order of Temasek to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He gave the Distinguished Service Order to Princess Anne.

In October 1972, Sheares opened the third Parliament, giving a speech about the new policies of the government for the next five years. He also announced new policies to be implemented in the government, including the periodic investigations of political parties by accountants and auditors, increased subsidiaries in health and education, and increasing the wages of workers. After the Robinsons department store fire in November 1972, Sheares appointed a three-man commission to do an inquiry into the fire in December. The report was received by Sheares in August 1973, and released to the public in December 1973. In February 1973, Sheares greeted American Vice President Spiro Agnew upon his visit to Singapore where Agnew discussed problems in Southeast Asia with other ministers. In March 1973, Sheares gave a speech at the Singapore Red Cross Society, praising their efforts in fundraising and stating that the society&#x27;s status would be recognised by Singapore. In July 1973, after the setting up of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights, Sheares sworn in the Chairman of the Council Wee Chong Jin. In September 1973, Sheares opened the 7th South East Asian Peninsular Games at the National Stadium as the host country.

Whilst serving his second term as president in 1974, Sheares taught demonstration classes at KKH to gynaecologists. In February 1974, Sheares assented eight acts including the Arms Offences Act and the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act. In June 1975, Sheares stated that the government expected a growth of five percent in the economy that year. In July 1975, Sheares was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine by Sir John Stallworthy. In November 1975, Sheares gave a speech after opening the fifth Pan-Pacific Conference of the International Society for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled at the Singapore Conference Hall, stating that more security measures should be in place to reduce workplace accidents that leave workers disabled. In October 1976, Sheares appointed Arumugam Ponnu Rajah as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Singapore. In December 1976, Sheares dissolved the third Parliament on the advice of the Cabinet, issuing Writs of Election for the 69 constituencies. In 1977, at the opening of the fourth Parliament, Sheares gave a speech addressing the economics and security of Singapore, stating that they have increased from prospects given in October 1972. Sheares also talked about adopting the science, technology, management, and marketing skills from the West.

During his third term in 1978, Sheares opened the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly at Mandarin Hotel and the sixth Asia and Oceania Congress of Endocrinology at Shangri-La Hotel. At the latter, Sheares gave a speech on how more research in family planning for women was needed to strengthen future policies. In October 1978, Sheares appointed T. S. Sinnathuray as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Singapore. In 1979, Sheares assented multiple acts such as the Money-Changing and Remittance Business Act 1979 and the State Immunity Act 1979. Throughout the 1970s, the trade union in Singapore had been growing exponentially, especially that of the National Trades Union Congress. In 1980, Sheares was involved in improving commercial and economic relations with Kuwait after a visit by the Emir of Kuwait Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah where they discussed strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries. In February 1981, Sheares opened the fifth Parliament and gave a 15-minute long speech. Sheares served his third term as president until his death in office in March 1981. Devan Nair succeeded him as president. According to a medical assistant of his, Sheares had possibly donated his entire salary as president to charity.

==Personal life==

Sheares married Yeo Seh Geok (1919–2012), a trained midwife, in 1939 and they had three children together. Their daughter, Constance Sheares (born 1941), is an arts administrator, curator, and writer. In 1955, Sheares and his family were robbed in their bungalow, which was provided by the University of Malaya in Singapore, and had worth of jewellery and cash stolen from them.

In November 1971, Sheares underwent medical treatment for a vascular disorder in the United States as the operation required had not yet been developed in Singapore. He returned in February 1972.

== Death and funeral ==

On 2 March 1981, it was found out that Sheares had lung cancer. On May 3, Sheares suffered from a brainstem ischaemia which caused him to go unconscious. On 7 May, Sheares slipped into a coma after developing a cerebral haemorrhage. On 12 May, two nurses from the Ministry of Health and a security officer with oxygen cylinders and a stretcher were sent to his house. He died later that day at 2:10 pm.

News of his death was first announced at 2:47 pm and all scheduled radio and television programs were cancelled. The flag at City Hall was flown at half-mast in respect. An open casket was held at his home with the first visitors being Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin and his wife, Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee and his wife, and Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Lee&#x27;s wife, and Lee&#x27;s daughter. Other visitors included Environment Minister Ong Pang Boon and Member of Parliament Lee Chiaw Meng.

Sheares&#x27; body was laid in state on 14 May with about 85,000 people showing up to pay their respects on 15 May. On 16 May, Sheares&#x27; coffin was carried from the Istana to Kranji State Cemetery to be buried where he was given a 21-gun salute by the Singapore Armed Forces. Foreign dignitaries who attended his funeral include Indonesian President Suharto, Thai Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Governor of Malacca Syed Zahiruddin Syed Hassan, and Filipino Speaker of the House Querube Makalintal. Other countries such as New Zealand, Myanmar, Japan, South Korea, Brunei, Maldives, Nauru, Sri Lanka, United States, and Australia also sent their representatives.

Then-United States president Ronald Reagan stated that Sheares&#x27; had &quot;an unselfish public devotion which all Americans admire.&quot; Then-Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia Sultan Ahmad Shah stated that he was &quot;an illustrious son of Singapore who had contributed much to the existing close relationship between [the] two countries.&quot; Then-Prime Minister Lee said &quot;his humble and unassuming manner belied an intense commitment to excellence&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Sheares is the first and only president to serve three terms and was also the longest-serving president at 10 years, before it was surpassed by S. R. Nathan in January 2010, who served for 12 years.

Locations in Singapore such as the Benjamin Sheares Bridge, Sheares Avenue, and Sheares Link are named after him. In academia, the student&#x27;s residence Sheares Hall at the National University of Singapore, Benjamin Henry Sheares Professorship in Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, Benjamin Sheares Professorship in Academic Medicine, and the Benjamin Sheares College at the Duke–NUS Graduate Medical School are all named after him.

<text>In mathematics, a Poisson superalgebra is a Z2-graded generalization of a Poisson algebra. Specifically, a Poisson superalgebra is an (associative) superalgebra &quot;A&quot; together with a second product, a Lie superbracket
:formula_1
such that (&quot;A&quot;, [·,·]) is a Lie superalgebra and the operator
:formula_2
is a superderivation of &quot;A&quot;:
:formula_3

Here, formula_4 is the grading of a (pure) element formula_5.

A supercommutative Poisson algebra is one for which the (associative) product is supercommutative.

This is one of two possible ways of &quot;super&quot;izing the Poisson algebra. This gives the classical dynamics of fermion fields and classical spin-1/2 particles. The other way is to define an antibracket algebra or Gerstenhaber algebra, used in the BRST and Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. The difference between these two is in the grading of the Lie bracket. In the Poisson superalgebra, the grading of the bracket is zero:
:formula_6
whereas in the Gerstenhaber algebra, the bracket decreases the grading by one:
:formula_7

== Examples ==
* If formula_8 is any associative Z2 graded algebra, then, defining a new product formula_9, called the super-commutator, by formula_10 for any pure graded x, y, turns formula_8 into a Poisson superalgebra.

<text>Constantino &quot;Tino&quot; Martinez (born December 7, 1967) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays from 1990 through 2005. He also served as a hitting coach for the Miami Marlins in 2013. He was also nicknamed &quot;The Bam-tino&quot; after his home run in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series. Formerly a third baseman, Martinez was the first round draft pick for the Seattle Mariners in out of the University of Tampa, where he starred during his time on campus. During his 16-year MLB career, he scored 1,009 runs, drove in 1,271 runs, and hit 339 home runs. He had 100 or more RBI in six different seasons and was twice named to the All-Star team.

==Early life==
Tino Martinez was born and raised in the neighborhood of West Tampa in Tampa, Florida, to a Cuban-American father with Spanish roots and a mother with Italian and Greek ancestry. His grandfather owned a small cigar factory, in which Martinez and his brothers, as well as childhood friend and fellow future major-leaguer Luis Gonzalez, worked as young boys. Martinez attended St. Joseph School in West Tampa until 8th grade, then attended Tampa Catholic High School for 9th and 10th grades, before transferring to and graduating from Jefferson High School. Martinez led both of his high schools to state baseball championships. With Tampa Catholic, he had future Major Leaguers Lance McCullers and Rich Monteleone as teammates.

Martinez enrolled at the University of Tampa, where he played college baseball for the Tampa Spartans in NCAA Division II. He played three years for Tampa, and was an All-American each year. In 1986, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. As of 2011, Martinez still held school records in career home runs (54), career batting average (.399), career slugging percentage (.736), single season batting average (.452) and single season slugging percentage (.957). In 1988, he was a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award, which has never been given to any NCAA Division II player. One year after graduating he was inducted into the University of Tampa&#x27;s athletics hall of fame. Since 2010, the Tino Martinez Award has been given to the most outstanding NCAA Division II baseball player. In 2013, Martinez was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==

===Seattle Mariners (1990–1995)===
The Seattle Mariners drafted Martinez in . Martinez&#x27;s first Major League manager was Lou Piniella, who had also grown up in the West Tampa neighborhood, and who knew Martinez&#x27;s uncle and mother. Martinez had several mediocre seasons, but broke out in when he drove in 111 runs, hit 31 home runs and batted .293. The Mariners clinched the AL West and went on to play in the first season of divisional postseason play against the New York Yankees.

===New York Yankees (1996–2001)===

Following that season, the New York Yankees acquired Martinez, along with Jeff Nelson and Jim Mecir, for Sterling Hitchcock and Russ Davis. Before the trade was finalized, Martinez and the Yankees agreed to a five-year, $20.25 million contract extension. Martinez succeeded Don Mattingly as the Yankees&#x27; starting first baseman.

Martinez was with the New York Yankees as they won four World Series championships in five seasons: , , , and . He also won the Home Run Derby in 1997. Martinez hit two memorable home runs as a Yankee in the World Series. The first came off Mark Langston in Game 1 of the 1998 Series. The Yankees had tied the game earlier in the inning with a Chuck Knoblauch three-run home run. The following three batters got on base, and Martinez came to the plate. After taking a very close pitch with a 2–2 count, which appeared to be strike three but was not ruled as such by umpire Richie Garcia, Martinez hit the next pitch into the upper deck for a grand slam, giving the Yankees a four-run lead. Martinez&#x27;s second memorable World Series home run came three years later, on October 31, 2001. The Yankees were down to their last out trailing by two runs, two outs in the 9th inning, when Martinez came to the plate with a runner on. He hit a game-tying home run to right center off Arizona Diamondbacks closer Byung-hyun Kim, and the Yankees went on to win the game. The feat was repeated the following night by Scott Brosius. However, the Yankees would lose Games 6 and 7 and thus the Series.

His best season statistically came in , when he was second in the American League in home runs and RBI (with 44 and 141 respectively), and finished second in AL Most Valuable Player voting. On May 19, 1998, he was hit by a pitch in the upper back by Baltimore Orioles pitcher Armando Benítez, which resulted in an intense brawl between the two teams.
In the 2001 World Series, Martinez&#x27;s Yankees faced off against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The series went to Game 7, which Arizona won when Luis Gonzalez, Martinez&#x27;s best friend, hit a game-winning single off Yankee closer Mariano Rivera in the bottom of the 9th inning. Gonzalez later recalled that when he went back home to check his answering machine, the first message of congratulations was from Martinez.

During most of his time with the Yankees, Martinez resided in Tenafly, New Jersey.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2002–2003)===
After the season the Yankees elected to sign Jason Giambi for and beyond. Martinez went on to play for the St. Louis Cardinals for two seasons, once again replacing an aging, legendary first baseman, Mark McGwire.

When Martinez returned to Yankee Stadium during a series in 2003, he received a standing ovation by Yankee fans. In the second game of the three game series, Martinez hit two home runs off former teammate Andy Pettitte, receiving a substantial ovation from the crowd both times. The Yankee fans cheered him for a curtain call, a rare occurrence in honor of a visiting team&#x27;s player.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2004)===
After the season, the Cardinals decided to have Albert Pujols switch from left field to first base. They traded Martinez to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, where he was reunited with his manager in Seattle, Lou Piniella, who was now managing the Devil Rays Martinez hit 23 home runs, while serving as a mentor for the team&#x27;s many young players, and was popular with Devil Rays&#x27; fans. His family lived just minutes from Tropicana Field.

Prior to the 2004 Summer Olympics, the host nation, Greece, trying to build up their chances of winning a medal, decided to put together a team of North American baseball players of Greek heritage. Martinez, having some Greek ancestry, was approached by the Greek Olympic team manager, Rob Derksen, and asked to play for the host nation. Martinez, along with fellow MLB players Eric Karros and Aaron Miles, declined the offer because the games were in the midst of the Major League Baseball season.

===Second stint with the New York Yankees (2005)===
Martinez returned for a second tour of duty with the Yankees for the 2005 season. From May 7–11, 2005, Martinez hit five home runs in five straight games, which is one more than his previous best, set from June 27 – July 31, 2001. Held homer-less on May 12, 2005, Martinez hit two homers on May 15 to give him eight home runs in eight games.

On November 8, 2005, the Yankees declined their $3 million option on Martinez, making him a free agent.

On Wednesday February 15, 2006, he officially decided to end his playing career. Martinez confirmed the decision in the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, telling the paper that he would begin his broadcasting career at ESPN. Martinez said that the offer from ESPN made his decision to retire a lot easier, as he would work on &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;, do some radio work, and broadcast a few games.

In his 16-year Major League career, Martinez hit .271 with 339 home runs and 1,271 RBI. During his seven years with the Yankees, he hit 192 home runs and drove in 739 runs.

===1988 Olympics===
Martinez, along with other future Major Leaguers Jim Abbott and Robin Ventura, won a gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the seventh time that baseball was part of the Olympic Games and its last year as a demonstration sport. In the final game, Martinez belted two homers and drove in four runs, and Abbott pitched a complete game, as they led the USA to a 5–3 win.

==Coaching and broadcasting==

In 2008, Martinez agreed to be a special instructor for the Yankees to help their first basemen with defensive skills.
After Spring training, he was named Special Assistant to the General Manager.

Starting in Spring training 2010, Martinez became a color commentator for the YES Network, replacing the departed David Cone. He made his regular season debut on April 9, 2010, when he called a game between the Yankees and the Rays that was coincidentally played back in his home area of Tampa Bay.

Martinez was named the hitting coach for the Miami Marlins for the 2013 season, replacing Eduardo Pérez. On July 28, 2013, Martinez resigned from the position amid allegations of physically abusing Derek Dietrich several months before the resignation. Martinez&#x27;s behavior in the clubhouse was reported to include verbal attacks towards the Marlins&#x27; Justin Ruggiano and Chris Valaika, along with minor league player Matt Downs.

In 2023, Martinez returned to the Cape Cod Baseball League as assistant coach of the Hyannis Harbor Hawks.

==Life outside Major League Baseball==
Martinez has been married to Marie Prado since 1991. They have three children: Olivia, Tino, Jr. (TJ), and Victoria. The family currently resides in West Tampa.

The premiere of &quot;Yankeeography: Tino Martinez&quot; appeared in early May 2006, on the YES Network. On April 2, 2007, Martinez received the 2007 Pride of The Yankees Award at the New York Yankees Homecoming Banquet.

In 2008, during the final season of the old Yankee Stadium, Martinez participated in his first Old Timers&#x27; Day.
In a Yankees vs. Orioles preseason game on March 14, 2010, it was mentioned by Yankees play-by-play announcer, Michael Kay, that Martinez is a fan of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Martinez also participates annually in the Derek Jeter Celebrity Invitational (DJCI) golf tournament in Tampa.

Martinez, who left the University of Tampa after his junior year to pursue professional baseball, received a bachelor&#x27;s degree at UT in liberal studies on May 7, 2011.

Martinez participated in the Yankees&#x27; 2011 Old Timers&#x27; Day on June 26, 2011. He has returned several more times. The Yankees honored Martinez with a plaque in Monument Park on June 21, 2014. Martinez was also present at a ceremony when former teammate Derek Jeter had his number 2 retired on May 14, 2017.

Since October 2019, Martinez has worked in commercial real estate in the Tampa area.

<doc id="882809" wikidata="Q1391255" url="?curid=882809" title="Nandan Nilekani">
<text>Nandan Mohanrao Nilekani is an Indian entrepreneur. He co-founded Infosys and is the non-executive chairman of Infosys replacing R Seshasayee and Ravi Venkatesan, who were the co-chairs of the board, on 24 August 2017. After the exit of Vishal Sikka, Nilekani was appointed as non-executive chairman of the board effective 24 August 2017.
He was the chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). After a successful career at Infosys, he headed the Government of India&#x27;s technology committee, TAGUP. He is a member of Indian National Congress but not active in politics as of 2019.

==Early life==
Nandan Nilekani was born in Bangalore. His parents Durga and Mohan Rao Nilekani were Konkani originally from Sirsi in Karnataka. His father worked as a general manager of Mysore and Minerva Mills and subscribed to Fabian Socialist ideals that influenced Nilekani in his early years. Nilekani&#x27;s elder brother, Vijay, works in the Nuclear Energy Institute in the United States.

Nilekani studied at the Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School and St. Joseph&#x27;s High School Dharwad, Karnataka PU College Dharwad and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from the IIT Bombay.

==Career==

===Information technology===
In 1978 he started his career at the Mumbai-based Patni Computer Systems, where he met and was interviewed by N.R. Narayana Murthy. In 1981, Nilekani, Murthy, and five others left Patni to start their own company, Infosys. Nilekani became the chief executive officer of Infosys in March 2002 and served as CEO of the company through April 2007, when he relinquished his position to his colleague Kris Gopalakrishnan and became co-chairman of the board of directors. Before assuming leadership as CEO in 2002, Nilekani held various posts, including managing director, president, and chief operating officer. He served as its CEO from March 2002 to April 2007. During his five-year tenure as CEO, Infosys&#x27; topline grew sixfold to $3 billion.

In 2017 he returned to Infosys after the exit of CEO Vishal Sikka to become a chairman. Upon his return he changed power centre from California back to its Bengaluru headquarters.
Also, such people as R. Seshasayee (a chairman and board director), Ravi Venkatesan (a co-chairman), Sikka (executive vice chairman and director), and Jeffrey Lehman and John Etchemendy (directors) resigned from their posts.

===Bureaucracy===
Nilekani left Infosys in July 2009 to serve as the chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India, a cabinet-ranking position that he entered under the invitation of Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. As chair of the UIDAI he was responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card, or Unique Identity card (UID Card) project in India. This initiative aims to provide a unique identification number for all residents of India and will be used primarily as the basis for the efficient delivery of welfare services. The identification method will be biometric, and the drive to create this government database of the entire population of India has been called &quot;the biggest social project on the planet.&quot;

They developed Aadhaar, which is an Indian biometric ID system, a database, which contains demographic information, home addresses of Indians. In April 2017 1.14 billion Indian people got their ID number. In 2016, World Bank Chief Economist Paul Romer called Aadhaar “the most sophisticated ID programme in the world.” This program is criticized for violating people&#x27;s privacy and exposing personal information.

He is a member of the board of governors of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) and the president of NCAER. He also sits on several advisory boards, including those of the World Economic Forum Foundation and the Bombay Heritage Fund.

Nilekani has appeared on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; to promote his book &quot;Imagining India: The Idea of a Renewed Nation&quot; and spoke at a TED conference in 2009 on his ideas for India&#x27;s future.

===Politics===
Nilekani joined Indian National Congress in March 2014 and contested from the Bangalore South constituency where he lost by votes to BJP candidate Ananth Kumar in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.

In December 2016, he joined a committee to investigate how people in India could use digital payments to a greater extent.

====General election 2014====
According to news reports, he was the richest candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with declared assets worth Rs 7,710 crore in his affidavit filed before the Election Commission.



===EkStep===
Nilekani is chairman of EkStep, a non-profit literacy and numeracy platform. Set up by the Nilekanis with an initial commitment of $10 million (about Rs 82 crore), EkStep looks at solving the &#x27;learning problem&#x27; by creating a technology-led platform to help children in improving their &#x27;learning outcomes&#x27; quite early in their life. EkStep intends to do it using gamified apps, hosted in the Google Play Store.

=== NCAER ===
Nilekani is president of the governing body of the New Delhi-based National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), India’s largest and oldest non-profit economic research think tank. NCAER, established in 1956, does grant-funded independent economic policy research and sponsored research studies for governments and industry. Its work covers almost all branches of economics, from economic forecasting to poverty analysis. NCAER is among a handful of think tanks globally that collect primary survey data on a scientific, national basis covering households, enterprises, consumers, and individuals. NCAER’s economic and social data sets are used widely for research and analysis on India.

=== Investments ===
Nilekani is also a serial investor and he has invested in technologoy startups including 10i Commerce, Juggernaut, Mubble Networks, Fortigo, P2SME, Railyatri, Axiom Consulting, Systemantics India, Sedemac Mechatronics, Disha Medical Services, Tracxn Technologies, and LetsVenture.

===Charity===
In 2017 Nandan and wife Rohini decided to donate 50 percent of their wealth to &quot;Giving Pledge&quot;, which is a movement organized by Bill Gates. The reason why they joined this movement was as following: &quot;We see inequality is increasing sharply in most countries. We see the young and the restless in this interconnected globe, unsure of their future, wanting more but anticipating less.&quot;

He also donated money to rebuild the hostel campus of IIT Bombay.

In 2008 he also set up the Indian Institute for Human Settlements to help to solve urban challenges for India.

==Personal life==

Nilekani is married to Rohini Nilekani (née Soman), whom he met at a quizzing event at IIT. They have two children, Nihar and Janhavi, each of whom has received an undergraduate degree from Yale University. His first language is Konkani.

<doc id="882811" wikidata="Q426025" url="?curid=882811" title="Duchy of Savoy">
<text>The Duchy of Savoy (; ) was a territorial entity of the Savoyard state that existed from 1416 until 1847 and was a possession of the House of Savoy. 

It was created when Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, raised the County of Savoy into a duchy for Amadeus VIII. The duchy was an Imperial fief, subject of the Holy Roman Empire, until 1792, with a vote in the Imperial Diet. From the 16th century, Savoy belonged to the Upper Rhenish Circle. 

Its territory included the current French departments of Savoie, Haute-Savoie, and the Alpes-Maritimes, the current Italian region of Aosta Valley, a large part of Piedmont and the County of Geneva in Switzerland, which was then lost to the Old Swiss Confederacy. The main Vulgar languages that were spoken within the Duchy of Savoy were Piedmontese and Arpitan.

==Terminology==
The Duchy of Savoy was the central and most prominent of the territories possessed by the House of Savoy, and hence this title was and still is used often to indicate the whole of their possessions. In reality, the Savoys ruled not a unitary state, but a complex array of different entities and titles with different institutional, cultural, and legal backgrounds. These included for example the Duchy of Aosta, Principality of Piedmont, and County of Nice, which were distinct and not juridically part of the Duchy of Savoy. The Savoys themselves referred to their possessions as a whole as &quot;the States of the Duke of Savoy&quot; (&quot;Italian&quot;: &quot;gli Stati del Duca di Savoia&quot;). Today, historians use the term &quot;Savoyard state&quot; to indicate this entity, which is an example of composite monarchy where many different and distinct territories are united in a personal union by having the same ruler. 

==History==
===15th century===
The duchy was created in 1416 when Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor (1433–1437) awarded the title of &quot;Duke&quot; to Count Amadeus VIII.

Being landlocked at its conception in 1388, the County of Savoy acquired a few kilometres of coastline around Nice. Other than this expansion, the 14th century was generally a time of stagnation. Pressure from neighbouring powers, particularly France, prevented development, which characterized the rest of the Renaissance era for Savoy.

The reign of Amadeus VIII was a turning point for the economy and the policy of the state, which deeply marked the history of the nation. His long reign was highlighted by wars (the country expanded its territory by defeating the Duchy of Montferrat and Marquisate of Saluzzo), as well as reforms, edicts and some controversial actions. The first was in 1434, when he chose to withdraw to the Château de Ripaille, where, living the life of a hermit, he founded the Order of St. Maurice. In 1439, he received an appointment as antipope, which he accepted (under the name of Felix V), although he subsequently resigned a decade later out of a fear of undermining the religious unity of Christians.
The second important action of the Government of Amadeus VIII was the creation of the Principality of Piedmont in August 1424, the management of which was entrusted to the firstborn of the family as a title of honor. The duke left the territory largely formed from the old Savoy domain.

As a cultured and refined man, Duke Amadeus gave great importance to art. Among others, he worked with the famous Giacomo Jaquerio in literature and architecture, encouraging the cultivation of the arts in the Italian Piedmont.

However, his first son Amedeo died prematurely in 1431 and was succeeded by his second son Louis. Louis was in turn succeeded by the weak Amadeus IX, who was extremely religious (he was eventually declared blessed), but of little practical power, to the point that he allowed his wife, Yolande (Violante) of Valois, sister of Louis XI, to make very important decisions. During this period, France was more or less free to control the affairs of Savoy, which bound Savoy to the crown in Paris.

The Duchy&#x27;s economy suffered during these years, not only because of war, but also because of the poor administration by Violante. The future of the nation was entrusted to the hands of a boy, Philibert I, who died at the early age of seventeen, after reigning for ten years. He was succeeded by Charles I, who died aged 21, and Charles II, who died aged 6. As a consequence of its participation in the Burgundian Wars, Savoy lost all its possessions north and south-east of Lake Geneva to the Swiss.

===16th century===
When Philibert II died in 1504, he was succeeded by Charles III the Good, and Savoy entered into a period of weak leadership. Later in 1515 as a part of the War of the League of Cambrai, the French defeated the Swiss and Milanese at the Battle of Marignano, occupied Milan, and put all of northern Italy including Saluzzo, Genoa and Savoy under its influence. King Francis I of France, however, was not satisfied and began to bide his time, just waiting for an opportunity to permanently annex Savoy and its possessions. Ultimately in 1536, Francis ordered the occupation of the duchy, which was invaded by a strong military contingent. Charles III realized too late the weakness of the state, and tried to defend the city of Turin. However, the city was lost on 3 April of the same year. Charles III retreated to Vercelli, trying to continue the fight, but never saw the state free from occupation.

Emmanuel Philibert was the duke who more than any other influenced the future policy of Savoy, managing to put an end to the more than twenty-year long occupation. The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, signed in 1559, restored full autonomy to the duchy, with his marriage to Margaret of France.

Emmanuel Philibert realized that Savoy could no longer trust France. He therefore moved the capital from Chambéry to Turin in 1562, which he protected with a complex system of fortifications known as the Cittadella (remnants of the Cittadella can still be seen, although it was largely destroyed by the subsequent expansion of the city). From his military experience in Flanders, Emmanuel Philibert learned how to run an army, having won the famous Battle of St. Quentin (1557). He was the first duke of Savoy to establish a stable military apparatus that was not composed of mercenaries but rather by specially trained Savoyard soldiers.

His son, Charles Emmanuel I, extended the duchy to the detriment of the lordships of Montferrat and the territory of Saluzzo, previously ceded to France, in 1601 under the Treaty of Lyon. The wars of Charles Emmanuel ended mostly in defeats. Nevertheless, he is remembered as &quot;Charles the Great&quot;, since he was a versatile and cultured man, a poet and a skillful reformer. He was able to manage the duchy at a time of severe crisis vis-a-vis the European powers and found support from the Habsburgs. The policy of Charles Emmanuel was in fact based more on actions of international warfare, such as the possessions of the Marquis of Saluzzo, and the wars of succession in the duchies of Mantua and Montferrat. Generally, Savoy sided with Spain, but on occasion allied with France (as, for example, the Treaty of Susa required).

===17th century===
During the seventeenth century, the influence of the court of Versailles put pressure on Savoy. Due to the proximity of the Spanish controlled Duchy of Milan and Savoyard defeats in the previous century, French troops were garrisoned in forts (such as Pinerolo) in a number of key Alpine passes on the Italian side. This severely threatened the independence of the duchy.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Savoy was one of the states of the Holy Roman Empire that largely sided with France and against both the Emperor and Spain. Savoyard troops participated on the side of the French in the Savoyard-Genoese War, the War of the Montferrat Succession, the Tornavento campaign and, in part, in the Piedmontese Civil War, among other places.

The strong French influence, plus various misfortunes, repeatedly hit Savoy following the death of Charles Emmanuel I (26 July 1630). First of all, the plague ran rampant in 1630 and contributed significantly to the already widespread poverty.

The War of the Mantuan Succession (1628–1631) was very bloody in the countryside and subjected Casale Monferrato to a long siege (1629). Developments of arms and politics affected the economy and future history, exacerbating the already difficult situation after the death of Victor Amadeus I in 1637. He was succeeded for a short period of time by his eldest surviving son, the 5-year-old Francis Hyacinth. The post of regent for the next-oldest son, Charles Emmanuel II, also went to his mother Christine of France, whose followers became known as &quot;madamisti&quot; (supporters of &quot;Madama Reale&quot;). Because of this, Savoy became a satellite state of the regent&#x27;s brother, King Louis XIII of France. The supporters of Cardinal Prince Maurice of Savoy and Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano (both sons of Charles Emmanuel I), together with their followers, took the name of &quot;principisti&quot; (supporters of the Princes).

Each warring faction soon besieged the city of Turin. The &quot;principisti&quot; made early gains, severely looting Turin on 27 July 1639. Only in 1642 did the two factions reach an agreement; by now, the widow of Victor Amadeus I had placed Victor&#x27;s son Charles Emmanuel II on the throne and ruled as regent in his place, even past his age of majority.

A resurgence of religious wars took place during the regency. Subsequently, in 1655, Savoyard troops massacred large numbers of the Protestant population of the Waldensian valleys, an event known as the Piedmontese Easter (). Reports from the massacres spread quickly throughout Protestant Europe, sparking outrage, especially in Britain. Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell threatened the Duchy of Savoy with intervention, somewhat shaping the military decisions made by the Duke. On 18 August 1655, the Pinerolo Declaration of Mercy was issued, which constituted a peace treaty between Charles Emmanuel II and the Waldensians.

The government of Charles Emmanuel II was the first step towards major reforms carried out by his successor Victor Amadeus II in the next century. Of particular importance were the founding of militias in Savoy and the establishment of the first public school-system in 1661. A cultured man, but also a great statesman, Charles Emmanuel imitated King Louis XIV of France at the sumptuous Palace of Venaria, a masterpiece of Baroque architecture, and a copy recreated in Italy of the magnificence of the Palace of Versailles. It was a time of great urban expansion, and Charles Emmanuel II promoted the growth of Turin and its reconstruction in the baroque style. After his death in 1675, there followed the period of the regency (1675-1684) of his widow, the new &quot;Madama Reale&quot;, Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy-Nemours.

===From duchy to kingdom===
Charles Emmanuel II was succeeded by his 11-year-old son, Victor Amadeus II; his mother, the French born Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy-Nemours was regent. Marie Jeanne sought to marry her son to the daughter and heir presumptive of King Peter II of Portugal. This could have led to the House of Savoy becoming rulers of Portugal.

After Victor Amadeus II assumed power, Savoy became hostile to France, which invaded in the Nine Years&#x27; War. Savoy defeated the French in the siege of Cuneo, but was dramatically defeated in the battles of Staffarda and Marsaglia. Savoy became a French satellite, and Victor Amadeus II married Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans, niece of King Louis XIV.
Savoy remained a French ally during the first phase of the War of the Spanish Succession, but changed sides later. France invaded again, and Savoy was saved by Austrian troops led by the duke&#x27;s cousin, Prince Eugene of Savoy at the siege of Turin.

At the end of the war in 1713, Victor Amadeus II received the Kingdom of Sicily. By the Treaty of London, Victor Amadeus II reluctantly exchanged Sicily for Sardinia in 1720. The various dominions held in personal union by Victor Amadeus II included Sardinia, Savoy, Piedmont, Aosta Valley, Nice, and Oneglia. The collection was usually referred to as &quot;Sardinia&quot;, meaning the kingdom.

Charles Emmanuel III, son and successor of Victor Amadeus II, joined the War of the Austrian Succession and concluded it with a resounding victory against the French in the Battle of Assietta. Gaining parts of western Lombardy like Angera and Vigevano in the subsequent treaty.

After the French Revolution, Savoy was invaded by the French Revolutionary Army in 1792 and annexed to France. Savoy was first incorporated as the department of Mont-Blanc; then, in 1798, it was divided between the departments of Mont-Blanc and Léman. Savoy, Piedmont, and Nice were restored to the House of Savoy at the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815.

Under the 1847 Perfect Fusion, the duchy was merged with the other parts of the Savoyard state into the unitary Kingdom of Sardinia. Savoy itself would be given to France under the terms of the Treaty of Turin (1860).

==Army==

The duchy was a notable regional military power, often getting involved in wars between the French and Habsburgs. In the 17th century, peacetime strength tended to hover around 4,800 professional soldiers (3,600 infantry and 1,200 cavalry), with a large peasant militia. In times of war, militiamen were trained and impressed and mercenaries were hired, and the size of the army quickly rose. In 1625, the duchy had an army of 26,600 regulars (25,381 infantry and 1,213 cavalry), plus about 8,000 militia. The regulars consisted of 5 to 7 regiments of Piedmontese, with mercenaries comprising the rest, including 9 regiments of French and 2 regiments of Italians. In 1635 the regular army was down to 12,250, then 15,710 in 1637, 18,000 in 1649, then 5,500 in the peacetime year of 1660, then 26,178 in 1672, and 35,000 in 1705 (with 10,000 militia called up to bolster them and more uncalled).

The militia was relatively well-armed and consisted of 24,000 men in 1566, of whom about a third could be used outside of their immediate district.

==Flag==
The flag of Savoy was a white cross on a red field. It is based on a crusader flag, and as such is identical in origin to the flag of the Knights of Malta (whence the modern Flag of Malta and of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta), and others (flags of Denmark and Switzerland, with inverted colors to those of England and Genoa, among others). In the 18th century, the letters &quot;FERT&quot; were sometimes added in the cantons to distinguish the flag from the Maltese one.

==Notes==
# When the Duchy of Savoy acquired Sicily in 1713 and later Sardinia in 1720, the title of &quot;Duke of Savoy&quot;, while remaining a primary title, became a lesser title to the title of King. The Duchy of Savoy remained as a state of the new country until the Perfect Fusion of King Charles Albert, at which point the kingdom became a unitary state.

<text>CB slang is the distinctive anti-language, argot, or cant which developed among users of Citizens Band radio (CB), especially truck drivers in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, when it was an important part of the culture of the trucking industry.

The slang itself is not only cyclical, but also geographical. Through time, certain terms are added or dropped as attitudes towards it changed. For example, in the early days of the CB radio, the term &quot;Good buddy&quot; was widely used.

Nicknames or call signs given or adopted by CB radio users are known as &quot;handles&quot;. Many truck drivers will call each other &quot;Hand,&quot; or by the name of the company for which they drive.

CB and its distinctive language started in the United States but was then exported to other countries including Mexico, Germany, and Canada.

<doc id="882813" wikidata="Q669569" url="?curid=882813" title="Gruel">
<text>Gruel is a food consisting of some type of cereal—such as ground oats, wheat, rye, or rice—heated or boiled in water or milk. It is a thinner version of porridge that may be more often drunk rather than eaten. Historically, gruel has been a staple of the Western diet, especially for peasants. Gruel may also be made from millet, hemp, barley, or, in hard times, from chestnut flour or even the less bitter acorns of some oaks. Gruel has historically been associated with feeding the sick and recently-weaned children.

&quot;Gruel&quot; is also a colloquial expression for any watery food of unknown character, e.g., pea soup. Gruel has often been associated with poverty, with negative associations attached to the term in popular culture, as in the Charles Dickens novels &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

==History==
Gruel predates the earliest civilizations, emerging in hunter-gatherer societies as a meal of gathered grains soaked in water. For these societies, the application of water and especially heat to grain improved its digestibility and nutritional content, and sanitized the mixture. This gruel also presented a viable medium for yeast to develop and ferment, serving as an important precursor for both bread and beer.

Gruel was the staple food of the ancient Greeks, for whom roasted meats were the extraordinary feast that followed sacrifice, even among heroes, and &quot;in practice, bread was a luxury eaten only in towns&quot;. Roman plebeians &quot;ate the staple gruel of classical times, supplemented by oil, the humbler vegetables, and salt fish&quot; for gruel could be prepared without access to the communal ovens in which bread was baked. In the Middle Ages, the peasant could avoid the tithe exacted by paying in grain ground by the miller of the landowner&#x27;s mill. When eaten by the peasant, the process was to roast the grains to make them digestible and grind small portions in a mortar at home. In lieu of cooking the resulting paste on the hearthstone, it could be simmered in a cauldron with water or, luxuriously, with milk.

In the United Kingdom, it was a common remedy for the sick, relatively nourishing and easy to digest, and a standard component of the evening meal in British hospitals into the early 20th century.

In the Americas, maize gruels were once one of the main food sources for many Mesoamerican peoples, such as the Maya and Aztecs. Atole is a preparation of ground maize often flavored with chili and salt (for a savory dish), or, in more modern times, with piloncillo and cinnamon (for a sweet dish). It can be consumed as an important calorie source as a thicker meal, or as a liquid drink.

Gruel was on the third-class menu of the &quot;Titanic&quot; on the eve of her sinking in April 1912.

== Variations ==
In many Spanish-speaking countries, several gruels are made; the masa-based drink or spoonable food called atole or atol de elote is a staple throughout Central America, served hot. It can range in consistency from a thin cloudy drink to a thicker porridge-like food. Horchata is a chilled sweetened drink of similar nature to thin atole. It is made from ground nutmeats or seeds, grains (often rice) and seasonings such as vanilla and cinnamon, served over ice.

Rice gruels eaten throughout Asia are normally referred to in English as porridge as opposed to gruel. Common forms include congee, from the Tamil word for the food and most common in Chinese zhou/zuk, Japanese okayu, Korean juk, Filipino goto, and Vietnamese cháo. Asian porridges/gruels are typically savory, with meat or vegetables added and stock sometimes used as the liquid cooking element.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives an etymology of Middle English &#x27; from the same word in Old French, both of them deriving from a source in Late Latin: &#x27;, a diminutive, as the form of the word demonstrates, possibly from an Old Frankish &quot;&quot;, surmised on the basis of a modern cognate &quot;grout&quot;. In modern Dutch, the plural word &quot;grutten&quot; still refers to de-husked, coarse ground grain and a traditional dish based on pearlbarley and blackberry is called watergruwel.

The Old Norse word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;coarse-ground grain&quot;, gives way to the Icelandic &quot;grautur&quot;, Faroese &quot;greytur&quot;, Norwegian &quot;grøt&quot; (nynorsk &quot;graut&quot;), Danish &quot;grød&quot;, and the Swedish and Elfdalian &quot;gröt&quot;, all meaning porridge, of which gruel is a subtype.

The German &quot;Grießmehl&quot;, ground grain, and Dutch &quot;griesmeel&quot;, are compounded cognates to the English &quot;grist&quot; and &quot;meal&quot;.

==In fiction==

In the English-speaking world, gruel is remembered as the food of the child workhouse inmates in Charles Dickens&#x27;s Industrial Revolution novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838); the workhouse was supplied with &quot;an unlimited supply of water&quot; and &quot;small quantities of oatmeal&quot;. When Oliver asks the master of the workhouse for some more, he is struck with a blow on the head for doing so. The &quot;small saucepan of gruel&quot; waiting upon Ebenezer Scrooge&#x27;s hob in Dickens&#x27;s 1843 novel &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; emphasizes how Scrooge is. Gruel is also Mr. Woodhouse&#x27;s preferred and offered dish in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot; (1816), often to comic or sympathetic effect. References to gruel in popular culture today continue to refer to miserly or starvation conditions, such as Gemma Collins in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 17&quot; (2016), who was denied food for gruel.

== Court decisions ==

&quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot; (1983) – Court affirmed that silent prayer was permissible in Mobile County public schools. Decision was reversed by Eleventh Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, both ruling that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

&quot;Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County&quot; (1987) – Court rules that textbooks promoting secular humanism were unconstitutional, running contrary to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Decision was reversed by Eleventh Circuit, which held that secular humanism was not a violation of the Establishment Clause as it is not a system of belief constituting a &quot;religion&quot;.

&quot;Searcy v. Strange&quot; (2015) – District Judge Callie V. S. &quot;Ginny&quot; Granade ruled that Alabama&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, violating the 14th Amendment&#x27;s equal protection clause, on January 23. Days later, she issued an order clarifying her ruling, saying that all Alabama probate judges, who issue marriage licenses, must comply with the order. She stayed her order for two weeks to allow state defendants time to seek a stay from a higher court. On February 3, the Eleventh Circuit denied the stay, after denying a stay in a similar case out of Florida months before. On February 9, as the order was set to take effect, the U.S. Supreme Court also denied the stay.

<doc id="882819" wikidata="Q4855029" url="?curid=882819" title="Bangalore Agenda Task Force">
<text>The Bangalore Agenda Task Force (BATF) in South India was a public-private partnership (PPP) that ran from 1999 till 2004 at the direction of the Chief Minister of Karnataka. The purpose of the taskforce was to bring in business and civic leaders on a pro-bono basis to design a development agenda for the city and suggest ways in which the city&#x27;s infrastructure and service delivery might be upgraded and improved according to best practice systems elsewhere. The purpose of the taskforce was to build government capacity through partnership between citizens, corporates and the city&#x27;s main administrative agencies – the BMP, BDA, BMTC, BWSSB, BESCOM, BSNL, and Bangalore Police. The BATF was a particularly influential task force, transcending an &#x27;advisory role&#x27; to mobilise private resources and catalyze significant changes in the agencies with which it engaged.

== Background &amp; History ==
The BATF was the brainchild of Infosys CEO Nandan Nilekani who would invest Rs 2 crore ($300,000) into the project over five years. The motivation for the project was to maintain Bangalore&#x27;s position as a leader in information technology in India against growing competition from other Indian cities such as Hyderabad.

Commencing in 1999, the BATF commissioned a survey by an independent organisation SOFRES - MODE to identify top citizen concerns. Following this, the first year focus was largely on short term works capable of yielding quick visible results for greater confidence besides generating experience for expanding and consolidating on long term infrastructure projects from year. The initial task, therefore, for the BATF and the stakeholders was to sit together and agree on an approach and formulate projects and programmes.

The BATF commenced strongly, but over the course of its operation ran into political difficulties that saw many of its more ambitious proposals sidelined or shelved.

== Methodology ==
The philosophy behind the BATF was of working within government institutions to improve their performance. It did not seek to create parallel institutions to bypass government agencies or advocate for the contracting out of major government responsibilities to the private sector. It sought solutions that whilst perhaps considered imperfect, would improve service delivery in an immediate and practical sense.

The BATF had little or no formal authority over any of the agencies with which they were dealing. Instead they applied informal pressure on agency heads to engage and improve service delivery, offering private sector skills and expertise at their own expense. Agency officials retained full autonomy to reject any BATF proposals.

== Membership ==

The BATF team comprised experts from various fields across all sectors, appointed by the Karnataka Govt. The team was headed by Nandan Nilekani and members included the likes of Naresh Venkataramanan, Kalpana Kar, Ramesh Ramanathan, Ravichander, Suresh Heblikar, Anuradha Hegde, Late H. Narasimhaiah, Sunil Shelar, etc. The members contributed to the city&#x27;s development by way of sharing knowledge. The BATF office was located in Alexandria Street, Bangalore and the infrastructure was created &amp; funded by the Chairman of BATF, itself. There were appointed technical staff through members of BATF for each of the programmes undertaken by it. The staff members were selected on the basis of expertise (skillset). These teams toiled in the background for all the programmes initiated by the BATF. Some of the key technical members were Subramanya M. R., handling road improvement projects, Deepa Hurali, handling Nirmala Bangalore and Bus Shelter projects, Milind Nirmal, handling self-assessment tax with BMP, Gopi Prasad, Sushma Nirmal, with Street Furniture, Road Signage projects, Sanjeev, with one-way traffic and road safety. Sheena, Soosai &amp; Manjula were working on the Swachha Bangalore project. Some of the project details can be referred to in the respective web links.

== Achievements ==

BATF brought much needed visibility to many civic issues and helped creating awareness among the public. The projects were seeds sown which continue to showcase the strength of PPP projects after a decade. Nirmala toilets showcased the quality of facilities, O&amp;M that can be maintained by government organisation in a third world country like India. Beautification of parks, signages brought in the much needed international look to the city. Today this Adopt a Park concept has moved beyond and one can notice there are various programmes that BBMP and other municipal bodies are following like Lake Improvement programmes. It is the concepts that were sowed and which have well been accepted even after BATF ceases to exist. The Nirmala toilet designs and the toilet designs adopted by KSRTC in their various cities changed the design concepts, material and specifications used which has led to good quality facilities that are easy to maintain and hygienic. Bus Shelter programme helped to realise the potential of advertisement revenues to maintain which providing the required facility for commuter in terms of shelter and route maps.

* The BATF advocated for the BBMP to introduce door-to-door waste collection, which was implemented in 2001. 
* The financial systems of several city agencies were computerized with fund-based accounting introduced at the expense of a BATF member. This made it possible for the agencies to gain a full record of their accounts for the first time and more easily identify waste and corruption. These reforms were so successful that 80% of it was included in India&#x27;s handbook of best practice produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General.
* They also provide public toilets and shower stalls for poor people.
* Successfully advocated for revenue generated by traffic fines to go back into the traffic police budget for expenditure on infrastructure to improve traffic management. Bangalore is the only city in India that uses traffic fines for investment in traffic management.
* Worked with the Police, BMP and MTC to developer a scientific traffic model called the Central Management Plan.
* Mobilised 1.5 crore investment from Mr Irfan Razak of Prestige to improve the road from Dairy Circle to Hosur Road.

== Legacy ==
The BATF ended formally in 2004, however the influence of the reform agenda it advocated has continued. Former members have been influential in the establishment of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and civic agencies such as Janaagraha, which includes the Jana Urban Space Foundation.

<doc id="882830" wikidata="Q1232887" url="?curid=882830" title="County of Savoy">
<text>The County of Savoy () was a feudal state of the Holy Roman Empire which emerged, along with the free communes of Switzerland, from the collapse of the Burgundian Kingdom in the 11th century. It was the cradle of the future Savoyard state.
==History==
Sapaudia, stretching south of Lake Geneva from the Rhône River to the Western Alps, had been part of Upper Burgundy ruled by the Bosonid duke Hucbert from the mid-9th century. Together with the neighbouring Free County of Burgundy (today&#x27;s &quot;Franche Comté&quot;), it became part of the larger Kingdom of Burgundy under King Rudolph II in 933.

Humbert the White-Handed was raised to count by the last king of Burgundy, Rudolph III, in 1003. He backed the inheritance claims of Emperor Henry II and in turn, was permitted to usurp the county of Aosta from its bishops at the death of Anselm. Following his support of Conrad II in annexing Arles upon Rudolph&#x27;s death and suppressing the revolts of Count Odo and Bishop Burchard, he also received the county of Maurienne (formerly held by the archbishops of Vienne) and territories in Chablais and Tarentaise, formerly held by its archbishops at Moûtiers.

While the Arelat remained a titular kingdom of the Holy Roman Empire, Humbert&#x27;s descendants—later known as the House of Savoy—maintained their independence as counts. In 1046, his younger son Otto married Adelaide, daughter of Ulric Manfred II, marquis of Susa. When she inherited her father&#x27;s lands in preference to other, male, relatives, he thereby acquired control of the extensive March of Turin. This was then united with Savoy upon his inheritance from his elder brother.
The counts further enlarged their territory when, in 1218, they inherited the Vaud lands north of Lake Geneva from the extinct House of Zähringen. In 1220, Count Thomas I occupied the towns of Pinerolo and Chambéry (&quot;Kamrach&quot;), which afterwards became the Savoy capital. In 1240, his younger son Peter II was invited to England by King Henry III, who had married Peter&#x27;s niece Eleanor of Provence. He was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Earl of Richmond and had the Savoy Palace erected in London.

In 1313, Count Amadeus V the Great officially gained the status of Imperial immediacy from Emperor Henry VII. What was left of the Kingdom of Burgundy effectively ceased to be entirely under the authority of the emperor after the Dauphiné had passed to the future King Charles V of France in 1349 and Amadeus VI of Savoy was appointed Imperial vicar of Arelat by Emperor Charles IV in 1365.

Amadeus VII gained access to the Mediterranean Sea by the acquisition of the County of Nice in 1388, and his son Amadeus VIII purchased the County of Geneva in 1401. The extended Savoy lands were finally raised to a duchy in 1416 by the German king Sigismund (see Duchy of Savoy 1416–1718).
