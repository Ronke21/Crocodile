<text>Aeneas Demetrius Williams ( ; born January 29, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback and safety who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons. He played college football for the Southern Jaguars and was selected in the third round of the 1991 NFL draft by the Phoenix Cardinals, where he spent 10 seasons. During his final four seasons, he was a member of the St. Louis Rams. Williams received eight Pro Bowl selections and three first-team All-Pro honors, as well as being on the second NFL 1990s All-Decade Team. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Williams was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Lawrence and Lillian Williams. Aeneas is the youngest of 3 brothers, Malcolm and Achilles. He attended the now defunct Alcee Fortier High School, where he played football on a team with three future NFL players: Maurice Hurst, Kevin Lewis, and Ashley Ambrose. In 1985, the Fortier Tarpons went undefeated through 10 games and won the District 10-4A championship and proceeded to the Class 4A semifinals. Aeneas was selected to the all-district team as a strong safety that season.

==College career==
Williams was not offered a scholarship when he graduated high school. He attended Southern University, the same school his brother Achilles attended, planning to simply get his accounting degree. &quot;Our parents always expected that we would go to college and get our degree,&quot; he explained. &quot;(Playing football) never crossed by mind, I was preparing for the rest of my life.&quot;

At Southern, he concentrated on his academics, not playing football until his junior year. Eventually, after being encouraged by his old high school teammate Maurice Hurst, he decided to join the team as a walk-on. He started out playing mostly on special teams, but made the starting lineup in the 5th game. Williams kept his involvement with the football team a secret from his family until he made the travel squad for the 2nd game of the season. In the following season, Williams was named to the All-Southwestern Athletic Conference team after leading the conference with seven interceptions. In 1990, Williams stayed on the team as a graduate student and fifth year senior in order to improve his draft status. He made the ALL SAC team again and tied the Division I-AA, (now known as the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision) record for most interceptions with eleven.

Williams finished his college career with 20 interceptions and 28 pass deflections.

==Professional career==
Williams&#x27;s numbers impressed the then-Phoenix Cardinals enough that they selected him in the third round of the 1991 NFL draft, Williams quickly established himself with an exceptional rookie season, tying the NFC lead for interceptions. In 1994, he led the NFL in interceptions with 9. By 1997, Williams had already notched four Pro Bowl appearances and had established himself as the Cardinals&#x27; top cornerback, routinely covering the opponents&#x27; lead receivers. In the 1998 season, Williams helped the Cardinals win their first playoff game since 1947 by intercepting two passes from Troy Aikman in a 20–7 win over the Dallas Cowboys, and added another interception in the Cardinals 41–21 loss in the divisional round. Despite playing mostly for bad teams (1998 was the only time he played on a winning team during his 10 years in Arizona), Williams was recognized as one of the best cornerbacks in the league, making six Pro Bowls in all as a Cardinal. He is regarded as one of the best defenders and players in Cardinals history, as well as one of the greatest shutdown corners of all time. In 2000, he tied an NFL record, held by Jack Tatum of the Oakland Raiders, by returning a fumble (caused by Mark Maddox) 104 yards for a touchdown in a game against the Washington Redskins.

In Week 3 of the 1999 season, in a game played at Sun Devil Stadium and nationally televised on Monday Night Football, Williams delivered the hit which ultimately ended Hall of Fame San Francisco 49ers&#x27; quarterback Steve Young&#x27;s career. Williams came in on a cornerback blitz from Young&#x27;s blindside and scored a clean text-book tackle that launched Young backward – causing Young to slam his head against the turf. Running back Lawrence Phillips was supposed to block Williams, but missed. This left Young unconscious on the field for several minutes. Young suffered a severe concussion that effectively ended his career; he didn&#x27;t play again for the rest of the season, after which the 49ers all but forced him to retire.

In 2001, Williams was traded to the St. Louis Rams on draft day in exchange for picks in the second and fourth rounds. Due to roster concerns, Williams switched to free safety. As one of the leaders of a much-improved defense, Williams got a chance to play in the postseason for only the second time in his career. In the Rams&#x27; divisional playoff game against the Green Bay Packers prior to the Super Bowl, he returned two interceptions from Packers quarterback Brett Favre for touchdowns and recovered a fumble. Then in the NFC title game, he intercepted a pass from Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, with 2 minutes left in regulation, clinching the game and ensuring the Rams&#x27; berth in Super Bowl XXXVI. However, the Rams lost that game to the New England Patriots.

After a lackluster season, in which he ended on the injured reserve list, Williams quietly retired during the 2005 offseason. Over his career he accumulated a staggering 12 defensive touchdowns (9 interceptions returned for a touchdown, and 3 fumbles recovered for touchdowns), and 55 career interceptions, cementing his place as one of the most dominating defensive backs of his era. He also recovered 23 fumbles and gained 1,075 total defensive return yards (807 from interceptions and 268 from fumbles). He was also a 4-time All-Pro selection.

Although Williams only played on a playoff team four times in 14 years (three of which were with the Rams), he made the most of his postseason opportunities when they occurred, intercepting 6 passes and recovering one fumble in his first four playoff games.

==Post-playing career==
Williams was inducted into the Arizona Cardinals&#x27; Ring of Honor during the 2008–2009 football season during halftime of the Monday Night Football game against the San Francisco 49ers November 10, 2008. On January 18, 2009, he was chosen to present the George Halas Trophy to the Arizona Cardinals after their victory in the NFC Championship game, resulting in the Cardinals first trip to the Super Bowl. He made his final appearance in a football videogame in NFL Street 2, which was released in 2004.

Williams is currently the founding pastor of Spirit Church in St. Ann, a suburb of St. Louis. He and his wife Tracy have three daughters Saenea (Aeneas spelled backwards), Tirzah, Cheyenne, and a son, Lazarus.

Williams was a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame classes of 2012 and 2013 but did not get voted in on the final ballots both times. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on February 1, 2014, and inducted on August 2.

On September 24, 2014, Williams was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>The National Mustard Museum (formerly the Mount Horeb Mustard Museum) is a museum near U.S. 14 in the heart of downtown Middleton, Wisconsin. It boasts a large display of prepared mustards. It is often featured in lists of unusual museums in the United States.

The museum was conceived and founded by Barry Levenson, former Assistant Attorney General of Wisconsin. It centers on a mustard collection he began in 1986 while despondent over the failure of his favorite baseball team, the Boston Red Sox, to win the 1986 World Series. The initial dozen jars have grown to a collection of more than 5,600 mustards from more than 60 countries, along with hundreds of items of mustard memorabilia and exhibits depicting the use of mustard through history.
The museum opened its doors in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, on April 6, 1992. It moved across the street to a larger site in October 2000. In November 2009, the museum moved to Middleton and changed its name to the present one.

Admission is free of charge, and the museum is open between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., though it is closed on Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s Day.

The museum&#x27;s gift shop occupies about half of its floor space and offers free tasting of mustard samples from a refrigerated case containing scores of varieties; the museum also operates a mail-order mustard business.

Among the displays are sweet hot mustards, fruit mustards, hot pepper mustards, horseradish mustards, and spirit mustards. The collection includes a large variety of French and English mixes, but many other countries are also represented.

In 2002, the museum was showcased on the Food Network television series &quot;Unwrapped&quot;. The museum and its curator have also been featured on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; broadcast of July 29, 2010, and &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot; on February 18, 1995 (when it was located in Mount Horeb).

<doc id="882845" wikidata="Q248786" url="?curid=882845" title="Bahri Mamluks">
<text>The Bahri Mamluks (), sometimes referred to as the Bahri dynasty, were the rulers of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt from 1250 to 1382, following the Ayyubid dynasty. The members of the Mamluk ruling class were purchased as slaves (mamluks) and manumitted, with the most powerful among them taking the role of sultan in Cairo. While several Bahri Mamluk sultans tried to establish hereditary dynasties through their sons, these attempts were ultimately unsuccessful, with the role of sultan often passing on to another powerful Mamluk. 

The Bahri Mamluks were of mostly Kipchak Turkic origin. Fourteen of eighteen sultans between 1279 and 1390 belonged to the Qalawunid lineage. After 1382/1390, they were succeeded by a second Mamluk regime, the Burji Mamluks, who were largely of Circassian origin. The name &quot;Bahri&quot; or &quot;Bahriyya&quot; means &#x27;of the river&#x27;, referring to the location of their original barracks on Roda Island in the Nile (&quot;Nahr al-Nil&quot;) in Cairo, at the citadel of Al-Rodah which was built by the Ayyubid sultan as-Salih Ayyub.

==History==

The Mamluks formed one of the most powerful and wealthiest empires of the time, lasting from 1250 to 1517 in Egypt, North Africa, and the Levant—Near East.

===Development===
In 1250, when the Ayyubid sultan as-Salih Ayyub died, the Mamluks he had owned as slaves murdered his son and heir al-Muazzam Turanshah, and Shajar al-Durr the widow of as-Salih became the Sultana of Egypt. She married the Atabeg (commander in chief) Emir Aybak and abdicated, Aybak becoming Sultan. He ruled from 1250 to 1257.

The Mamluks consolidated their power in ten years and eventually established the Bahri dynasty. They were indirectly helped by the Mongols&#x27; sack of Baghdad in 1258, which effectively destroyed the Abbasid caliphate. Cairo became more prominent as a result and remained a Mamluk capital thereafter.
The Mamluks were powerful cavalry warriors mixing the practices of the Turkic steppe peoples from which they were drawn and the organizational and technological sophistication and horsemanship of the Arabs. In 1260 the Mamluks defeated a Mongol army at the Battle of Ain Jalut in present-day Israel and eventually forced the invaders to retreat to the area of modern-day Iraq. The defeat of the Mongols at the hands of the Mamluks enhanced the position of the Mamluks in the southern Mediterranean basin. Baibars, one of the leaders at the battle, became the new Sultan after the assassination of Sultan Qutuz on the way home.

In 1250 Baibars was one of the Mamluk commanders who defended Mansurah against the Crusade knights of Louis IX of France, who was later definitely defeated, captured in the Battle of Fariskur and ransomed. Baibars had also taken part in the Mamluk takeover of Egypt. In 1261, after he became a Sultan, he established a puppet Abbasid caliphate in Cairo, and the Mamluks fought the remnants of the Crusader states in Palestine until they finally captured Acre in 1291.

====Tatars and Mongols====
Many Tatars settled in Egypt and were employed by Baibars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibn Taghri/ vol.7&quot;&gt;Ibn Taghri/ vol. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated the Mongols at the battle of Elbistan and sent the Abbasid Caliph with only 250 men to attempt to retake Baghdad, but was unsuccessful. In 1266 he devastated Cilician Armenia and in 1268 he recaptured Antioch from the Crusaders. In addition, he fought the Seljuks, and Hashshashin; he also extended Muslim power into Nubia for the first time, before his death in 1277.

Sultan Qalawun defeated a rebellion in Syria that was led by Sunqur al-Ashqar in 1280, and also defeated another Mongol invasion in 1281 that was led by Abaqa outside Homs. After the Mongol threat passed he recaptured Tripoli from the Crusaders in 1289. His son Khalil captured Acre, the last Crusader city, in 1291.
The Mongols renewed their invasion in 1299, but were again defeated in 1303 in the Battle of Shaqhab. The Egyptian Mamluk Sultans entered into relations with the Golden Horde who converted to Islam and established a peace pact with the Mongols&lt;ref name=&quot;Shayyal, p.187/vol.2&quot;&gt;Shayyal, p. 187/vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; in 1322.

Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad married a Mongol princess in 1319. His diplomatic relations were more extensive than those of any previous Sultan, and included Bulgarian, Indian, and Abyssinian potentates, as well as the pope, the king of Aragon and the king of France. Al-Nasir Muhammad organized the re-digging of a canal in 1311 which connected Alexandria with the Nile. He died in 1341.

===Decline===
The constant changes of sultans that followed led to great disorder in the provinces. Meanwhile, in 1349 Egypt and the Levant in general were introduced to Black Death, which is said to have killed many inhabitants.

In 1382 the last Bahri Sultan Hajji II was dethroned and the Sultanate was taken over by the Circassian Emir Barquq. He was expelled in 1389 but returned to power in 1390, setting up an era where the sultanate was controlled by the Burji Mamluks.

==Military organization==
On a general level, the military during the Bahri dynasty can be divided into several aspects:

* Mamluks: The core of both the political and military base, these slave soldiers were further divided into Khassaki (comparable to imperial guards), Royal Mamluks (Mamluks directly under the command of the Sultan) and regular Mamluks (usually assigned to local Amirs).
* Al-Halqa: These primarily free born professional forces were also directly under the sultan&#x27;s command.
* Wafidiyya: Turks and Mongols that migrated to the dynasty&#x27;s border after the Mongol invasion, typically given land grants in exchange for military service; they were well regarded forces.
* Other levies: Primarily Bedouin tribes, but also on different occasions also different groups of Turkomans and other settled Arabs.

==List of Bahri Sultans==
Following As-Saleh, the Burji dynasty took over the Mamluk Sultanate under Sayf-ad-Din Barquq in 1389–90 C.E.

<text>The Burji Mamluks () or Circassian Mamluks (), sometimes referred to as the Burji dynasty, were the rulers of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt from 1382 until 1517. As with the preceding Bahri Mamluks, the members of the Burji Mamluk ruling class were purchased as slaves (mamluks) and manumitted, with the most powerful among them taking the role of sultan in Cairo. During this period, the ruling Mamluks were generally of Circassian origin, drawn from the Christian population of the northern Caucasus. The name &quot;Burji&quot;, meaning &#x27;of the tower&#x27;, refers to the traditional residence of these Mamluks in the barracks of the Citadel of Cairo.

Although sultans typically designated their sons to succeed them after death, the latter rarely lasted more than a few years before being usurped by one of the powerful Mamluk commanders, usually from among the Mamluks purchased by previous sultans. Political power-plays often became important in designating a new sultan.

During this period, the Mamluks fought Timur and conquered Cyprus. Over the course of the 15th century, the sultanate was weakened by infighting and economic decline brought about by multiple factors. Although militarily powerful, they were eventually unable to compete with the more modern army of the Ottoman Empire, leading to their eventual conquest in 1517 by the Ottomans.

==History==
=== Establishment and early challenges ===

From 1250, Egypt had been ruled by the first Mamluk dynasty, the mostly Cuman-Kipchak Turkic Bahri dynasty. In 1377 a revolt broke out in Syria which spread to Egypt, and the government was taken over by the Circassians Barakah and Barquq; Barquq was proclaimed &quot;sultan&quot; in 1382, ending the Bahri dynasty. He was expelled in 1389 but recaptured Cairo in 1390. Early on, the Zahiri Revolt threatened to overthrow Barquq though the conspiracy was discovered before agitators could mobilize. Permanently in power, he founded the Burji dynasty.

Faced with a common enemy, Timur, Barquq joined with Bayezid I and Toktamish in a combined resistance and executed Timur&#x27;s peace envoys. In the following months Timur was engaged in Georgia and unable to respond to Barquq&#x27;s actions, while Barquq had died by 1399. In 1401, Timur invaded Syria and sacked Aleppo and Damascus. Syria was regained by Barquq&#x27;s son, sultan Nasir-ad-Din Faraj, after Timur died in 1405, but Faraj continually faced rebellions from the emirs there and he was forced to abdicate in 1412.

After Faraj, the Abbasid caliph al-Musta&#x27;in was permitted to rule the sultanate in Cairo for several months, but the role of sultan was soon taken by another Mamluk, Al-Mu&#x27;ayyad Shaykh.

=== Apogee and decline ===

Under the reign of Sultan Barsbay, the Mamluk Sultanate grew to its widest territorial extent. In 1426, he invaded the Kingdom of Cyprus and forced its kings to become Mamluk vassals. However, Barsbay also introduced a number of economic policies that were damaging in the long term, such as a state monopoly on the spice trade. During Barsbay&#x27;s reign Egypt&#x27;s population was greatly reduced from what it had been a few centuries before, with only one fifth of the number of towns. He frequently raided Asia Minor, but died in 1438.

During the reign of Sayf ad-Din Jaqmaq an attempt to conquer Rhodes in 1444 from the Knights of St. John was repelled.

Sayf ad-Din Inal came to power in 1453 and had friendly relations with the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II, who captured Constantinople later that year, causing great celebration in Egypt. The relationship between the Ottomans and the Mamluks became more adversarial after this time. Both states constantly vied for control of the spice trade, and the Ottomans aspired to eventually take control of the Holy Cities of Islam. Under the reign of Khusqadam, of Greek origin,&lt;ref name=&quot;https://books.google.se/books?id=J6v9jhUd-r8C&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=burji+dynasty&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6t-mM7s7RAhWKjSwKHQq6AXE4FBDoAQgpMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=burji%20dynasty&amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tensions increased. Both Khusqadam and Mehmed II supported different candidates to the principality of Karaman. 

After the death of Mehmed II in 1481, Sultan Qaitbay offended the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II by harboring his rebellious brother, Cem. Bayezid II later seized Adana, Tarsus and other places within Mamluk territory, but was unable to defeat the Mamluks during a prolonged war that ended in 1491. Qaitbay also tried to help the Muslims in Spain by threatening the Christians in Syria, but without effect. He died in 1496, leaving several hundred thousand ducats in debts to the great Venetian trading families.

Following another several years of political instability and succession disputes, the last major Mamluk sultan was Qansuh al-Ghuri, who came to power in 1501. While he attempted some reforms, including the introduction of the first military regiment with gunpowder weapons, he was unable to fully integrate them into the Mamluk army and he could not fix the country&#x27;s economic problems.

=== Conquest by the Ottomans ===

By 1516, the Ottomans were free from other concerns — Sultan Selim I had just vanquished the Safavid Persians at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 —and turned their full might against the Mamluks, who still ruled in Syria and Egypt, to complete the Ottoman conquest of the Middle East. Al-Ghuri led his army to confront Selim I&#x27;s invasion of Syria in 1516, but he died in the Battle of Marj Dabiq and the Mamluk army was routed.

In 1517, the Ottomans completed their conquest with the capture of Cairo on January 22. The centre of power transferred from Cairo to Constantinople. However, the mamluks continued to exist as a political and military class in Ottoman Egypt. While the governors were appointed by the Ottoman sultan, the mamluks vied for influence within the country and held many high political positions. They were finally destroyed and exterminated by Muhammad Ali Pasha during his rise to power in Egypt in the early 19th century.

<doc id="882884" wikidata="Q5972272" url="?curid=882884" title="World Netball Rankings">
<text>The World Netball Rankings are published by the World Netball to make it possible to compare the relative strengths of internationally active national netball teams. Initially, rankings were based on the results from the World Netball Championships, and released after the conclusion of each event, every four years. A new ranking system was implemented on 11 February 2008, wherein teams are ranked based on international tests played in the last four years. Teams appear on the rankings list once they have played eight international test matches.

Australia and New Zealand have dominated the world rankings in previous years and they are the only two netball nations to have ever held the number one world ranking since its introduction in 2009. In 2018, England became the first team to be ranked in the top two outside of Australia and New Zealand, after winning gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia.

==World rankings==
== Calculation==
All test matches played by a team in the last four years, including matches in the Netball World Cup and Commonwealth Games, are considered in the calculation. The ranking of teams is determined by comparing teams&#x27; ratings, which is the average points earned per match in the last four years.

;Points per match
Teams earn points for each match, with the specific amount determined based on the outcome of the match (win or loss) and the rating of their opponents.
*In matches between teams within 40 rating points of each other, winning a game earns a team 50 more points than their opponent&#x27;s current rating, while losing a match earns a team 50 points less than their opponent&#x27;s current rating. 
*In matches between teams more than 40 rating points apart, an exception is applied where the rating of a team&#x27;s opponent is treated as if it is &quot;exactly&quot; 40 points apart for the purpose of the calculation. That is, higher-rated team would have their opponent possess a rating of 40 points less than them, while the lower-rated team would have their opponent possess a rating of 40 above them.
A team&#x27;s rating always increases following a victory and decreases after a loss. However, winning against a higher-ranked team increases a team&#x27;s rating more and losing against a lower-ranked team decreases a team&#x27;s rating more.

;Weighting
In the calculation of a team&#x27;s rating, the points earned for each game are weighted based on the time the match was played.
* Matches played in the two most recent years before the time of calculation are weighted at 100%.
* Matches played three to four years before the time of calculation are weighted at 50%.

<doc id="882887" wikidata="Q714535" url="?curid=882887" title="Musha Incident">
<text>The Musha Incident (; ), also known as the Wushe Rebellion and several other similar names, began in October 1930 and was the last major uprising against colonial Japanese forces in Japanese Taiwan. In response to long-term oppression by Japanese authorities, the Seediq indigenous group in the settlement of Musha (Wushe) attacked a school, killing 134 Japanese and two Han Taiwanese children. In response, the Japanese led a counter-attack, killing 354 Seediq in retaliation. The handling of the incident by the Japanese authorities was strongly criticised, leading to many changes in Aboriginal policy.

==Background==
Previous armed resistance to Japanese imperial authority had been dealt with harshly, as demonstrated by responses to previous uprisings, such as the Tapani Incident, which resulted in a cycle of rebel attacks and harsh Japanese retaliation. However, by the 1930s, armed resistance had largely been replaced by organised political and social movements among the younger Taiwanese generation. Direct police involvement in local administration had been relaxed, many harsh punishments were abolished, and some elements of self-government, albeit of questionable effectiveness, had been introduced to colonial Taiwan.

However, a different approach was used in order to control Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous peoples. The indigenous peoples of Formosa Island were still designated as , and treated as inferiors, rather than as equal subjects. Tribes were &quot;tamed&quot; through &quot;assimilation&quot;, the process of disarming traditional hunting tribes and forcing them to relocate to the plains and lead an agrarian existence. Further resistance was then dealt with by military campaigns, isolation and containment. In order to access natural resources in mountainous and forested indigenous-controlled areas, Governor-General Sakuma Samata adopted a more aggressive terrain policy, attempting to pacify or eradicate aboriginal groups in areas scheduled for logging within five years&#x27; time; by 1915, this policy had been largely successful, although resistance still existed in the more remote areas.

===Proximal causes===
The Seediq people in the vicinity of Musha village had been considered by the Japanese authorities to be one of the most successful examples of this &quot;taming&quot; approach, with Chief Mona Rudao being one of 43 indigenous leaders selected for a tour of Japan a few years earlier. However, resentment still lingered, due largely to police misconduct, the ongoing practice of forced labor, and the lack of respect for Indigenous beliefs and customs.

In the days immediately prior to the incident, Chief Mona Rudao held a traditional wedding banquet for his son, Daho Mona, during which animals were slaughtered and wine was prepared and drunk. A Japanese police officer named Katsuhiko Yoshimura was on patrol in the area, and was offered a cup of wine by Daho Mona as a symbolic gesture. The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona&#x27;s hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to take hold of the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a flagon of wine at the officer&#x27;s house, but was turned away. The simmering resentment among the Seediq in Musha was finally pushed to the limit.

==Incident==

On 27 October 1930, hundreds of Japanese converged on Musha for an athletics meet at the elementary school. Shortly before dawn, Mona Rudao led over 300 Seediq warriors in a raid of strategic police sub-stations to capture weapons and ammunition. They then moved on to the elementary school, concentrating their attack on the Japanese in attendance. A total of 134 Japanese, including women and children, were killed in the attack. Two Han Taiwanese dressed in Japanese clothing were also mistakenly killed, one of whom was a girl wearing a Japanese kimono. Most of the victims were beheaded. The Seediqs had intended to kill only Japanese people.

==Consequences==
The Japanese authorities responded with unprecedentedly harsh military action. A press blackout was enforced, and Governor General Ishizuka Eizō ordered a counter-offensive of two thousand troops to be sent to Musha, forcing the Seediq to retreat into the mountains and carry out guerrilla attacks by night. Unable to root out the Seediq despite their superior numbers and greater firepower, the Japanese faced a political need for a faster solution. Consequently, Japan&#x27;s army air corps in Taiwan ordered bombing runs over Musha to smoke out the rebels, dropping mustard gas bombs in what was allegedly the first such use of chemical warfare in Asia. The uprising was swiftly quelled, with any remaining resistance suppressed by the third week of December 1930; Mona Rudao had committed suicide on November 28, but the uprising had continued under other leaders. Of the 1,200 Seediq directly involved in the uprising, 644 died, 290 of whom committed suicide to avoid dishonour. While the Geneva Protocol of 1925 made the wartime use of chemical weapons by land, naval, and air forces a war crime, the treaty does not apply to internal disturbances or conflicts, and Japan was not a signatory to the treaty until May 21, 1975.

Due to internal and external criticism of their handling of the incident, Ishizuka and Hitomi Jirō, his chief civil administrator, were forced to resign in January 1931. However, Ishizuka&#x27;s replacement, Ōta Masahiro, also took a harsh approach to controlling Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous peoples: certain tribes were disarmed and left unprotected, giving their aboriginal enemies an opportunity to annihilate them on behalf of the Japanese administration. Around 500 of the Seediq involved in the Musha Incident surrendered and were subsequently confined to a village near Musha. However, on 25 April 1931, indigenous groups working with the Japanese authorities attacked the village, beheading all remaining males over the age of 15. This is known as the &quot;Second Musha Incident&quot;.

The uprising did effect a change in the authorities&#x27; attitudes and approaches towards aboriginals in Taiwan. Musha had been regarded as the most &quot;enlightened and compliant&quot; of the aboriginal territories, and the colonial power&#x27;s inability to prevent the massacre provoked a fear of similar nationalist movements starting in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan itself. A change in policy was clearly needed. Ching suggests that the institution of empire-building (&quot;kominka&quot; ) became the dominant expression of colonial control: aboriginals came to be seen as imperial subjects on equal footing with other ethnic groups in Taiwan, and were upgraded in status from &quot;raw savages&quot; to . 

During the Musha Incident, the Seediq under Mona Rudao revolted against the Japanese, while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry of the Seediq with the Toda and Truku was aggravated by the Musha Incident, given that the Japanese had long played them off against each other. Following the incident, part of Seediq land was ceded to the Truku and Toda by the authority.

==In the media==
The Musha Incident has been depicted three times in movies, in 1957 in the Taiwanese film &quot;Qing Shan bi xue&quot; (), in the 2003 TV drama &quot;&quot;, and in the 2011 Taiwanese film &quot;Seediq Bale&quot;. 

Wu He&#x27;s novel &quot;Remains of Life&quot; (originally published in Chinese in 2000; published in English translation in 2017) is a fictionalized account of the aftermath of this incident.

<text>Martin Newell (born 4 March 1953) is an English singer–songwriter, poet, columnist and author who leads the Cleaners from Venus, a guitar pop band with jangly, upbeat arrangements. He is also regarded as a significant figure in the history of cassette culture and DIY music.

==Musical career==

===1973–1979===
In the summer of 1973, a 20-year-old Newell joined Colchester glam rock cover band Plod as their lead singer, replacing founder member Steve Greenfield. Plod was signed to London-based indie label Banjul Records in early 1975, and quickly began recording tracks for an album. However, contractual irregularities and financial problems at the label prevented the album from being finished or released, and the band broke up within a few months of being signed. In 2003, one track from the sessions (&quot;Neo City&quot;) was released on a &#x27;70s glam-rock compilation CD titled &quot;Velvet Tinmine&quot;. This track was credited to &quot;The&quot; Plod, and remains the only officially issued work by the band.

Newell then joined Gypp, a pop-oriented progressive rock band, as lead singer. Gypp also played abroad and became popular in Germany&#x27;s North Rhine-Westphalia area thanks to their live performances. Gypp issued one three-song 7-inch EP in 1978, but their music was out of step with the punk-oriented trends of the UK music scene at the time and the EP received a negative review in the &quot;New Musical Express.&quot; Demoralised, Newell left the band. By his own account, he then became a &quot;musical recluse&quot;, staying in the studio and creating new songs but not playing live gigs for many years.

===1979–1992===
In the late-70s, Newell led a four-piece rock combo called the Stray Trolleys. They recorded material in 1979 and 1980, but it was not released until after the band had broken up.

In the meantime, Newell issued his first solo single (&quot;Young Jobless&quot; b/w &quot;Sylvie in Toytown&quot;) on vinyl in 1980. By the end of 1980, he was collaborating with Lawrence &quot;Lol&quot; Elliot as the Cleaners from Venus, a band that mostly released their work on cassettes outside the traditional music distribution channels.

By 1983, the Cleaners from Venus had evolved into a band with a floating line-up that featured Newell as its only constant member. The band still primarily issued material on cassette, got signed to the West German independent label Modell Records for one vinyl album (&quot;Under Wartime Conditions&quot;) and ultimately to the German subsidiary of RCA Records, which released two albums (&quot;Going to England&quot;, &quot;Town and Country&quot;).

Giles Smith joined Newell as the only other official member of the Cleaners from Venus between 1986-1988, and in 1987, Newell returned to performing live under the Cleaners from Venus banner. As well, while regularly releasing the Cleaners from Venus material on cassette, through the 1980s Newell also occasionally released cassette singles and albums under his own name. On these solo releases he was usually the only musician.

In the spring of 1988, Newell and Nelson (Peter Nice) formed the duo, the Brotherhood of Lizards, self-releasing the mini-album &quot;The Brotherhood of Lizards&quot; that year, followed by the album, &quot;Lizardland,&quot; released on independent label Deltic Records in 1989. To support &quot;Lizardland&quot; the duo embarked on an eco-friendly promotional tour, cycling over 1000 miles across southern England between October 1989 and February 1990 making local radio appearances and doing local newspaper interviews, while also busking and performing gigs. The uniqueness of this &quot;green tour&quot; caught the attention of the mainstream media with the duo making half a dozen television appearances, and interviews with them appeared in the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot;. On completion of the tour, Nelson was recruited as the replacement bass player for the band New Model Army and the Brotherhood of Lizards disbanded.

===1993–present===
In 1993, Newell began working primarily as a solo artist with more conventional production values. His first non-cassette solo album, &quot;The Greatest Living Englishman&quot;, was produced by XTC&#x27;s Andy Partridge, and was a critical success. Commercially, it remains his most popular and successful album. It was followed by three more albums (&quot;The Off White Album&quot;, produced by Louis Philippe, &quot;The Spirit Cage&quot; and &quot;Radio Autumn Attic&quot;) and an EP (&quot;Songs from the Station Hotel&quot;) that continued to explore the same subject matter as &quot;The Greatest Living&quot; &quot;Englishman&quot;, including the charms of rural or small-town English life and portraits of characters and scenes.

Newell has also made live appearances with the Cleaners from Venus and the Stray Trolleys in the 1990s and beyond, and has issued several post-1993 live recordings with these bands. However, studio releases credited to these groups post-1993 are actually all CD reissues of pre-1993 material previously released only on cassette. In addition, Gypp played reunion gigs in 1996, and live Gypp material – as well as Gypp demos recorded in the late 1970s – have now been officially issued on CD.

In 2004 Newell released an album of light jazz songs, &quot;The Light Programme&quot;. The album was not particularly successful commercially but his next album, &quot;A Summer Tamarind,&quot; returned to his usual style and was much more warmly received.

In late 2005, the British singer Richard Shelton released a jazz vocal album called &quot;Top Cat&quot; with five Newell compositions. Newell&#x27;s songs have also been recorded by Miki Huber, the Jennifers, Kerry Getz, R. Stevie Moore and Alphaville. In 2011 MGMT covered a Cleaners From Venus song on their &quot;We Hear of Love, of Youth, and of Disillusionment&quot; EP.

Since 2010, Newell has returned to making lo-fi, self-released music under the Cleaners from Venus moniker. In 2022, he formed the Light Music Company with former Dolly Mixture member Rachel Love.

==Filmography==
Newell is the subject of Graham Bendel&#x27;s 2019 documentary &quot;Upstairs Planet: Cleaners from Venus &amp; the Universe of Martin Newell&quot;, the 2022 documentary &quot;The Jangling Man: The Martin Newell Story&quot; and the 2022 animated documentary short &quot;A Man for Our Time&quot;.

==Literary career==
Newell is better known to some as a poet and author; he has released several volumes of poetry (often in collaboration with the illustrator James Dodds) and a memoir, &quot;This Little Ziggy&quot;, about his youth and his days in Plod. In 2007, he released a volume of reminiscences, anecdotes and historical information about his beloved Wivenhoe. He is also a weekly contributor of poetry to &quot;The Sunday Express,&quot; He now writes a weekly column for the East Anglian Daily Times (for which he won columnist of the year in the EDF/ East of England Media Awards in January 2010), performs annually at the Essex Book Festival and occasionally issues spoken word recordings of his poems.

==Personal life==
Newell said that he has dyspraxia and Asperger syndrome.

Newell attended the Elliott School (now Ark Putney Academy) in Putney, southwest London, for two years as a teen. One of his classmates was future actor Pierce Brosnan (nicknamed &quot;Irish&quot;), and he alludes to &quot;the next James Bond&quot; in the 2022 song &quot;Baby Space-Cakes&quot;, from the Cleaners from Venus album, &quot;That London&quot;.

<text>4D Man (also known as The Evil Force in the UK; reissued as Master of Terror in the US) is a 1959 independent American science-fiction film in color by De Luxe, produced by Jack H. Harris (from his original screenplay), directed by Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., and starring Robert Lansing, Lee Meriwether, and James Congdon. The film was released by Universal-International.

==Plot==

A brilliant but irresponsible scientist, Dr. Tony Nelson, develops an electronic amplifier that he hopes will allow any object to achieve a fourth-dimensional (4D) state. While in this state, any object can pass freely through any other object. Tony, however, fails to pay attention to the overload, which sparks an electrical fire that burns down his laboratory. This results in the university terminating his contract. Now unemployed, Tony seeks out his brother, Scott, also a PhD, to help him with his experiment. Scott is a researcher in a plant located in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and is working on a material called Cargonite that is so dense that it is impenetrable.

Scott is underpaid and unappreciated at his new job. He does not have the necessary drive to ask his employer, Mr. Carson, for greater recognition. Scott has become the driving force behind the development of Cargonite, named after Carson, who is now taking much of the credit for Scott&#x27;s work. When his girlfriend, Linda Davis, falls for Tony, an enraged Scott steals Tony&#x27;s experiment and starts playing around with it, eventually transforming himself into a 4D state. When demonstrating this to Tony, Scott leaves the amplifier power turned off, yet he successfully passes his hand through a block of steel. Scott can now enter a 4D state at will. Tony is amazed, but warns Scott not to reveal this ability until he can further test for possible side effects.

In the lab, Tony realizes what transpired on an earlier experiment of his, to fuse lead with gold. Tony realizes that through an extremely slow process, the two substances can merge, and his experiment was to forge them immediately, which he realizes would break down the substances. While in the 4D state (signified by a &#x27;shimmering&#x27; sound effect), Scott can pass through any solid object. He experiments with his new abilities by shoplifting a piece of fruit through a grocery store&#x27;s solid window. Scott also notices a diamond necklace on display in a nearby jewelry-store window, but decides against stealing it. When he sees a bank, however, his face breaks into a sly grin.
He soon discovers, though, that the process ages him at a greatly accelerated rate. The aged Scott accidentally learns how to survive, when he visits the company doctor, who, to his horror, suddenly drops dead while examining him. He realizes that by passing any part of his body through another person, Scott can drain anyone&#x27;s lifeforce, thereby rejuvenating himself. 
The following day, news hits town that $50,000 were stolen from the bank with no sign of forced entry, nor any video footage of the crime. Strangely, a $1000 bill was found protruding from a solid piece of tempered steel, leaving the authorities perplexed. Tony realizes that Scott is abusing his power and tries to convince the police.

Scott starts using his newfound power to acquire all the things he felt he was denied - money, recognition, power, and women. Scott confronts Carson, revealing the experiment, then taking his revenge &quot;for the life drained from me&quot; by literally draining Carson&#x27;s lifeforce. Scott then proceeds to a sleazy bar, where he gets some street toughs to back down. When he goes to open the door, his hand goes through it even though he did not want to be intangible. With his newfound bravado, he ignores this development; combined with his victory over the toughs and his ill-gotten money, he impresses a bar girl. When they later kiss, Scott&#x27;s power turns itself on again and the B-girl flees in horror now that she has rapidly aged, her blonde hair now white.

The police have to find a way to stop a man who is unstoppable. Looking very old now, Scott returns to the lab, but the police are unable to stop him, as well as a rival scientist who tried to steal Tony&#x27;s work, whom Scott kills and thereby becomes less aged. Linda begs Scott to come to his senses. Scott kisses her, but unlike with the B-girl, his power is off and she has not aged. Linda then shoots Scott in solid form. Bleeding and feeling betrayed, Scott maniacally proclaims his invincibility and defiantly phase-shifts his body (albeit with difficulty) through a wall embedded with supposedly impenetrable Cargonite. &quot;The End&quot; appears on screen, followed a moment later by a question mark, which leaves Scott&#x27;s fate undetermined.

<doc id="882896" wikidata="Q433995" url="?curid=882896" title="Fujiwara no Kamatari">
<text>Fujiwara no Kamatari (藤原 鎌足, 614 – November 14, 669), also known as , was a Japanese politician and aristocrat who, together with Prince Naka no Ōe (later Emperor Tenji), carried out the Taika Reform. He was the founder of the Fujiwara clan, the most powerful aristocratic family in Japan during the Nara and Heian periods. He, along with the Mononobe clan, was a supporter of Shinto and fought the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. The Soga clan, defenders of Buddhism in the Asuka period, defeated Kamatari and the Mononobe clan, and Buddhism became the dominant religion of the Imperial Court. Kamatari was appointed Inner Minister, and, along with Prince Naka no Ōe, later Emperor Tenji (626–672), launched the Taika Reform of 645, which centralized and strengthened the central government. Just before his death, he received the surname &quot;Fujiwara&quot; and the rank from Emperor Tenji, thus establishing the Fujiwara clan.

==Biography==
Kamatari was born to the Nakatomi clan, an aristocratic kin group claiming descent from their ancestral god Ame-no-Koyane. He was the son of Nakatomi no Mikeko, and named Nakatomi no Kamatari (中臣 鎌足) at birth. His early life and exploits are described in the 8th century clan history &quot;Tōshi Kaden&quot; (藤氏家伝).

He was a friend and supporter of the Prince Naka no Ōe, later Emperor Tenji. Kamatari was the head of the &quot;Jingi no Haku&quot;, or Shinto ritualists; as such, he was one of the chief opponents of the increasing power and prevalence of Buddhism in the court, and in the nation. As a result, in 645, Prince Naka no Ōe and Kamatari made a coup d&#x27;état in the court. They slew Soga no Iruka who had a strong influence over Empress Kōgyoku; thereafter, Iruka&#x27;s father, Soga no Emishi, committed suicide.

Empress Kōgyoku was forced to abdicate in favor of her younger brother, who became Emperor Kōtoku; Kōtoku then appointed Kamatari &quot;naidaijin&quot; (Inner Minister).

Kamatari was a leader in the development of what became known as the &quot;Taika Reforms,&quot; a major set of reforms based on Chinese models and aimed at strengthening Imperial power. He acted as one of the principal editors responsible for the development of the Japanese legal code known as &quot;Sandai-kyaku-shiki&quot;, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Rules and Regulations of the Three Generations&quot;.

During his life Kamatari continued to support Prince Naka no Ōe, who became Emperor Tenji in 661. Tenji granted him the highest rank &quot;Taishōkan&quot; (or Daishokukan) (大織冠) and a new clan name, Fujiwara (藤原), as honors.

==Legacy==
Kamatari&#x27;s son was Fujiwara no Fuhito. Kamatari&#x27;s nephew, Nakatomi no Omimaro became head of Ise Shrine, and passed down the Nakatomi name.

In the 13th century, the main line of the Fujiwara family split into five houses: Konoe, Takatsukasa, Kujō, Nijō and Ichijō. These five families in turn provided regents for the Emperors, and were thus known as the Five Regent Houses. The Tachibana clan (samurai) also claimed descent from the Fujiwara. Emperor Montoku of the Taira clan was descended through his mother to the Fujiwara.

Until the marriage of the Crown Prince Hirohito (posthumously Emperor Shōwa) to Princess Kuni Nagako (posthumously Empress Kōjun) in January 1924, the principal consorts of emperors and crown princes had always been recruited from one of the Sekke Fujiwara. Imperial princesses were often married to Fujiwara lords - throughout a millennium at least. As recently as Emperor Shōwa&#x27;s third daughter, the late former Princess Takanomiya (Kazoku), and Prince Mikasa&#x27;s elder daughter, the former Princess Yasuko, married into Takatsukasa and Konoe families, respectively. Empress Shōken was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan and through Hosokawa Gracia of the Minamoto clan. Likewise a daughter of the last Tokugawa Shōgun married a second cousin of Emperor Shōwa.

Among Kamatari&#x27;s descendants are Fumimaro Konoe the 34th/38th/39th Prime Minister of Japan and Konoe&#x27;s grandson Morihiro Hosokawa the 79th Prime Minister of Japan (who is also a descendant of the Hosokawa clan via the Ashikaga clan of the Minamoto clan).

== Historic sites ==

=== Abuyama Kofun ===
Abuyama Kofun, a megalithic tomb in Takatsuki and Ibaraki, Osaka has been identified as Fujiwara no Kamatari&#x27;s tomb. The tomb and a mummy buried inside a coffin were first discovered in 1934. 50 years later, radiographic images and samples taken at the time were examined uncovering a mummy wrapped in gold thread. The &quot;kanmuri&quot; headwear found in the tomb indicates that the person buried was a noble of the highest rank &quot;Taishokkan&quot;. It was concluded that it is highly likely that the tomb was dedicated to Kamatari. According to the analysis, the mummified person had a strong bone structure and an athletic body, with the so-called pitcher&#x27;s elbow. The cause of death was complications from injuries to the vertebral column and lumbar vertebrae sustained from a fall from horseback or a high ground. The injury is thought to have left the lower body paralyzed and caused secondary complications such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection. The cause of death matches with that of Kamatari&#x27;s, whom is recorded to have died from a fall from horseback.

=== Higashinara site ===
In 2014, the Ibaraki City Education Committee announced that ancient &quot;sen&quot; bricks discovered at Higashinara site in Ibaraki, Osaka match with the bricks found in Abuyama Kofun. The site is believed to have been the location of Mishima Betsugyō, a villa where Kamatari stayed before the Isshi Incident which triggered the Taika Reform (645).

<text>Martin Edward Newell is a British-born computer scientist specializing in computer graphics who is perhaps best known as the creator of the Utah teapot computer model.

==Career==
Before emigrating to the US, he worked at what was then the Computer-Aided Design Centre (CADCentre) in Cambridge, UK, along with his brother Dick Newell (who went on to co-found two of the most important UK graphics software companies – Cambridge Interactive Systems (CIS) in 1977 and Smallworld in 1987). At CADCentre, the two Newells and Tom Sancha developed Newell&#x27;s algorithm, a technique for eliminating cyclic dependencies when ordering polygons to be drawn by a computer graphics system.

Newell developed the Utah teapot while working on a Ph.D. at the University of Utah, where he also helped develop a version of the painter&#x27;s algorithm for rendering. He graduated in 1975, and was on the Utah faculty from 1977 to 1979. Later he worked at Xerox PARC, where he worked on JaM, a predecessor of PostScript. JaM stood for &quot;John and Martin&quot; – the John was John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe Systems.

Newell departed Xerox PARC to join CADLINC Inc., a factory automation startup, as VP of Advanced Development. 
There he led the development of a variety of CAD/CAM software applications, such as CimCAD (a 3-D drafting program)
and Intelligent Documentation 
(an early electronic document editor integrating text, graphics, and information from relational databases).

He departed CADLINC to found the computer-aided design software company Ashlar in 1988. In 2007, Newell was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to computer-graphics modeling, rendering, and printing. He recently retired as an Adobe Fellow at Adobe Systems.

<text>In differential geometry, a field in mathematics, a Poisson manifold is a smooth manifold endowed with a Poisson structure. The notion of Poisson manifold generalises that of symplectic manifold, which in turn generalises the phase space from Hamiltonian mechanics.

A Poisson structure (or Poisson bracket) on a smooth manifold formula_1 is a functionformula_2on the vector space formula_3 of smooth functions on formula_1, making it into a Lie algebra subject to a Leibniz rule (also known as a Poisson algebra).

Poisson structures on manifolds were introduced by André Lichnerowicz in 1977 and are named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, due to their early appearance in his works on analytical mechanics.

== Introduction ==

=== From phase spaces of classical mechanics to symplectic and Poisson manifolds === 
In classical mechanics, the phase space of a physical system consists of all the possible values of the position and of the momentum variables allowed by the system. It is naturally endowed with a Poisson bracket/symplectic form (see below), which allows one to formulate the Hamilton equations and describe the dynamics of the system through the phase space in time.

For instance, a single particle freely moving in the formula_5-dimensional Euclidean space (i.e. having formula_6 as configuration space) has phase space formula_7. The coordinates formula_8 describe respectively the positions and the generalised momenta. The space of observables, i.e. the smooth functions on formula_7, is naturally endowed with a binary operation called Poisson bracket, defined as formula_10. Such bracket satisfies the standard properties of a Lie bracket, plus a further compatibility with the product of functions, namely the Leibniz identity formula_11. Equivalently, the Poisson bracket on formula_7 can be reformulated using the symplectic form formula_13. Indeed, if one considers the Hamiltonian vector field formula_14 associated to a function formula_15, then the Poisson bracket can be rewritten as formula_16

In more abstract differential geometric terms, the configuration space is an formula_5-dimensional smooth manifold formula_18, and the phase space is its cotangent bundle formula_19 (a manifold of dimension formula_20). The latter is naturally equipped with a canonical symplectic form, which in canonical coordinates coincides with the one described above. In general, by Darboux theorem, any arbitrary symplectic manifold formula_21 admits special coordinates where the form formula_22 and the bracket formula_23 are equivalent with, respectively, the symplectic form and the Poisson bracket of formula_7. Symplectic geometry is therefore the natural mathematical setting to describe classical Hamiltonian mechanics.

Poisson manifolds are further generalisations of symplectic manifolds, which arise by axiomatising the properties satisfied by the Poisson bracket on formula_25. More precisely, a Poisson manifold consists of a smooth manifold formula_26 (not necessarily of even dimension) together with an abstract bracket formula_27, still called Poisson bracket, which does not necessarily arise from a symplectic form formula_28, but satisfies the same algebraic properties.

Poisson geometry is closely related to symplectic geometry: for instance, every Poisson bracket determines a foliation whose leaves are naturally equipped with symplectic forms. However, the study of Poisson geometry requires techniques that are usually not employed in symplectic geometry, such as the theory of Lie groupoids and algebroids.

Moreover, there are natural examples of structures which should be &quot;morally&quot; symplectic, but fails to be so. For example, the smooth quotient of a symplectic manifold by a group acting by symplectomorphisms is a Poisson manifold, which in general is not symplectic. This situation models the case of a physical system which is invariant under symmetries: the &quot;reduced&quot; phase space, obtained by quotienting the original phase space by the symmetries, in general is no longer symplectic, but is Poisson. 

=== History ===
Although the modern definition of Poisson manifold appeared only in the 70&#x27;s–80&#x27;s, its origin dates back to the nineteenth century. Alan Weinstein synthetised the early history of Poisson geometry as follows:&quot;Poisson invented his brackets as a tool for classical dynamics. Jacobi realized the importance of these brackets and elucidated their algebraic properties, and Lie began the study of their geometry.&quot;

Indeed, Siméon Denis Poisson introduced in 1809 what we now call Poisson bracket in order to obtain new integrals of motion, i.e. quantities which are preserved throughout the motion. More precisely, he proved that, if two functions formula_15 and formula_30 are integral of motions, then there is a third function, denoted by formula_31, which is an integral of motion as well. In the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics, where the dynamics of a physical system is described by a given function formula_32 (usually the energy of the system), an integral of motion is simply a function formula_15 which Poisson-commutes with formula_32, i.e. such that formula_35. What will become known as Poisson&#x27;s theorem can then be formulated asformula_36Poisson computations occupied many pages, and his results were rediscovered and simplified two decades later by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Jacobi was the first to identify the general properties of the Poisson bracket as a binary operation. Moreover, he established the relation between the (Poisson) bracket of two functions and the (Lie) bracket of their associated Hamiltonian vector fields, i.e.formula_37in order to reformulate (and give a much shorter proof of) Poisson&#x27;s theorem on integrals of motion. Jacobi&#x27;s work on Poisson brackets influenced the pioneering studies of Sophus Lie on symmetries of differential equations, which led to the discovery of Lie groups and Lie algebras. For instance, what are now called linear Poisson structures (i.e. Poisson brackets on a vector space which send linear functions to linear functions) correspond precisely to Lie algebra structures. Moreover, the integrability of a linear Poisson structure (see below) is closely related to the integrability of its associated Lie algebra to a Lie group.

The twentieth century saw the development of modern differential geometry, but only in 1977 André Lichnerowicz introduce Poisson structures as geometric objects on smooth manifolds. Poisson manifolds were further studied in the foundational 1983 paper of Alan Weinstein, where many basic structure theorems were first proved.

These works exerted a huge influence in the subsequent decades on the development of Poisson geometry, which today is a field of its own, and at the same time is deeply entangled with many others, including non-commutative geometry, integrable systems, topological field theories and representation theory.

==Formal definition==
There are two main points of view to define Poisson structures: it is customary and convenient to switch between them.

=== As bracket ===
Let formula_1 be a smooth manifold and let formula_39 denote the real algebra of smooth real-valued functions on formula_1, where the multiplication is defined pointwise. A Poisson bracket (or Poisson structure) on formula_1 is an formula_42-bilinear map

:formula_43

defining a structure of Poisson algebra on formula_39, i.e. satisfying the following three conditions:
* Skew symmetry: formula_45.
* Jacobi identity: formula_46.
* Leibniz&#x27;s Rule: formula_47.

The first two conditions ensure that formula_48 defines a Lie-algebra structure on formula_39, while the third guarantees that, for each formula_50, the linear map formula_51 is a derivation of the algebra formula_39, i.e., it defines a vector field formula_53 called the Hamiltonian vector field associated to formula_15. 

Choosing local coordinates formula_55, any Poisson bracket is given byformula_56for formula_57 the Poisson bracket of the coordinate functions.

=== As bivector ===
A Poisson bivector on a smooth manifold formula_1 is a Polyvector field formula_59 satisfying the non-linear partial differential equation formula_60, where 

:formula_61

denotes the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket on multivector fields. Choosing local coordinates formula_55, any Poisson bivector is given byformula_63for formula_64 skew-symmetric smooth functions on formula_65.

=== Equivalence of the definitions ===
Let formula_48 be a bilinear skew-symmetric bracket (called an &quot;almost Lie bracket&quot;) satisfying Leibniz&#x27;s rule; then the function formula_31 can be described asformula_68for a unique smooth bivector field formula_69. Conversely, given any smooth bivector field formula_70 on formula_1, the same formula formula_72 defines an almost Lie bracket formula_48 that automatically obeys Leibniz&#x27;s rule. 

A bivector field, or the corresponding almost Lie bracket, is called an almost Poisson structure. An almost Poisson structure is Poisson if one of the following equivalent integrability conditions holds: 

* formula_48 satisfies the Jacobi identity (hence it is a Poisson bracket);
* formula_70 satisfies formula_60 (hence it a Poisson bivector);
* the map formula_77 is a Lie algebra homomorphism, i.e. the Hamiltonian vector fields satisfy formula_78;
* the graph formula_79 defines a Dirac structure, i.e. a Lagrangian subbundle of formula_80 which is closed under the standard Courant bracket.
=== Holomorphic Poisson structures ===
The definition of Poisson structure for &quot;real&quot; smooth manifolds can be also adapted to the complex case.

A holomorphic Poisson manifold is a complex manifold formula_26 whose sheaf of holomorphic functions formula_82 is a sheaf of Poisson algebras. Equivalently, recall that a holomorphic bivector field formula_83 on a complex manifold formula_26 is a section formula_85 such that formula_86. Then a holomorphic Poisson structure on formula_87 is a holomorphic bivector field satisfying the equation formula_88. Holomorphic Poisson manifolds can be characterised also in terms of Poisson-Nijenhuis structures.

Many results for real Poisson structures, e.g. regarding their integrability, extend also to holomorphic ones.

Holomorphic Poisson structures appear naturally in the context of generalised complex structures: locally, any generalised complex manifold is the product of a symplectic manifold and a holomorphic Poisson manifold.

==Symplectic leaves==

A Poisson manifold is naturally partitioned into regularly immersed symplectic manifolds of possibly different dimensions, called its symplectic leaves. These arise as the maximal integral submanifolds of the completely integrable singular distribution spanned by the Hamiltonian vector fields.

=== Rank of a Poisson structure ===
Recall that any bivector field can be regarded as a skew homomorphism formula_89. The image formula_90 consists therefore of the values formula_91 of all Hamiltonian vector fields evaluated at every formula_92. 

The rank of formula_70 at a point formula_92 is the rank of the induced linear mapping formula_95. A point formula_92 is called regular for a Poisson structure formula_70 on formula_1 if and only if the rank of formula_70 is constant on an open neighborhood of formula_92; otherwise, it is called a singular point. Regular points form an open dense subset formula_101; when the map formula_102 is of constant rank, the Poisson structure formula_70 is called regular. Examples of regular Poisson structures include trivial and nondegenerate structures (see below).

=== The regular case ===
For a regular Poisson manifold, the image formula_90 is a regular distribution; it is easy to check that it is involutive, therefore, by the Frobenius theorem, formula_1 admits a partition into leaves. Moreover, the Poisson bivector restricts nicely to each leaf, which therefore become symplectic manifolds. 

=== The non-regular case ===
For a non-regular Poisson manifold the situation is more complicated, since the distribution formula_90 is singular, i.e. the vector subspaces formula_107 have different dimensions.

An integral submanifold for formula_108 is a path-connected submanifold formula_109 satisfying formula_110 for all formula_111. Integral submanifolds of formula_70 are automatically regularly immersed manifolds, and maximal integral submanifolds of formula_70 are called the leaves of formula_70.

Moreover, each leaf formula_115 carries a natural symplectic form formula_116 determined by the condition formula_117 for all formula_118 and formula_111. Correspondingly, one speaks of the symplectic leaves of formula_70. Moreover, both the space formula_121 of regular points and its complement are saturated by symplectic leaves, so symplectic leaves may be either regular or singular.

=== Weinstein splitting theorem ===
To show the existence of symplectic leaves also in the non-regular case, one can use Weinstein splitting theorem (or Darboux-Weinstein theorem). It states that any Poisson manifold formula_122 splits locally around a point formula_123 as the product of a symplectic manifold formula_124 and a transverse Poisson submanifold formula_125 vanishing at formula_126. More precisely, if formula_127, there are local coordinates formula_128 such that the Poisson bivector formula_70 splits as the sumformula_130where formula_131. Notice that, when the rank of formula_70 is maximal (e.g. the Poisson structure is nondegenerate, so that formula_133), one recovers the classical Darboux theorem for symplectic structures.

==Examples==

=== Trivial Poisson structures ===
Every manifold formula_1 carries the trivial Poisson structureformula_135equivalently described by the bivector formula_136. Every point of formula_1 is therefore a zero-dimensional symplectic leaf.

=== Nondegenerate Poisson structures ===
A bivector field formula_70 is called nondegenerate if formula_139 is a vector bundle isomorphism. Nondegenerate Poisson bivector fields are actually the same thing as symplectic manifolds formula_21.

Indeed, there is a bijective correspondence between nondegenerate bivector fields formula_70 and nondegenerate 2-forms formula_22, given byformula_143where formula_22 is encoded by the musical isomorphism formula_145. Furthermore, formula_70 is Poisson precisely if and only if formula_22 is closed; in such case, the bracket becomes the canonical Poisson bracket from Hamiltonian mechanics:formula_148nondegenerate Poisson structures on connected manifolds have only one symplectic leaf, namely formula_1 itself.

=== Log-symplectic Poisson structures ===
Consider the space formula_7 with coordinates formula_151. Then the bivector fieldformula_152is a Poisson structure on formula_7 which is &quot;almost everywhere nondegenerate&quot;. Indeed, the open submanifold formula_154 is a symplectic leaf of dimension formula_20, together with the symplectic formformula_156while the formula_157-dimensional submanifold formula_158 contains the other formula_159-dimensional leaves, which are the intersections of formula_160 with the level sets of formula_161.

This is actually a particular case of a special class of Poisson manifolds formula_162, called log-symplectic or b-symplectic, which have a &quot;logarithmic singularity&quot; concentrated along a submanifold formula_163 of codimension 1 (also called the singular locus of formula_70), but are nondegenerate outside of formula_160.

=== Linear Poisson structures ===
A Poisson structure formula_166 on a vector space formula_167 is called linear when the bracket of two linear functions is still linear.

The class of vector spaces with linear Poisson structures coincides actually with that of (dual of) Lie algebras. Indeed, the dual formula_168 of any finite-dimensional Lie algebra formula_169 carries a linear Poisson bracket, known in the literature under the names of Lie-Poisson, Kirillov-Poisson or KKS (Kostant-Kirillov-Souriau) structure:formula_170where formula_171 and the derivatives formula_172 are interpreted as elements of the bidual formula_173. Equivalently, the Poisson bivector can be locally expressed asformula_174where formula_175 are coordinates on formula_168 and formula_177 are the associated structure constants of formula_178. Conversely, any linear Poisson structure formula_166 on formula_167 must be of this form, i.e. there exists a natural Lie algebra structure induced on formula_181 whose Lie-Poisson bracket recovers formula_166.

The symplectic leaves of the Lie-Poisson structure on formula_183 are the orbits of the coadjoint action of formula_184 on formula_183. For instance, for formula_186 with the standard basis, the Lie-Poisson structure on formula_183 is identified withformula_188and its symplectic foliation is identified with the foliation by concentric spheres in formula_189 (the only singular leaf being the origin). On the other hand, for formula_190 with the standard basis, the Lie-Poisson structure on formula_183 is identified withformula_192and its symplectic foliation is identified with the foliation by concentric hyperboloids and conical surface in formula_189 (the only singular leaf being again the origin).

=== Fibrewise linear Poisson structures ===
The previous example can be generalised as follows. A Poisson structure on the total space of a vector bundle formula_194 is called fibrewise linear when the bracket of two smooth functions formula_195, whose restrictions to the fibres are linear, is still linear when restricted to the fibres. Equivalently, the Poisson bivector field formula_70 is asked to satisfy formula_197 for any formula_198, where formula_199 is the scalar multiplication formula_200.

The class of vector bundles with linear Poisson structures coincides actually with that of (dual of) Lie algebroids. Indeed, the dual formula_201 of any Lie algebroid formula_202 carries a fibrewise linear Poisson bracket, uniquely defined byformula_203where formula_204 is the evaluation by formula_205. Equivalently, the Poisson bivector can be locally expressed asformula_206where formula_175 are coordinates around a point formula_92, formula_209 are fibre coordinates on formula_201, dual to a local frame formula_211 of formula_212, and formula_213 and formula_214 are the structure function of formula_212, i.e. the unique smooth functions satisfyingformula_216Conversely, any fibrewise linear Poisson structure formula_166 on formula_218 must be of this form, i.e. there exists a natural Lie algebroid structure induced on formula_219 whose Lie-Poisson backet recovers formula_166.

If formula_212 is integrable to a Lie groupoid formula_222, the symplectic leaves of formula_201 are the connected components of the orbits of the cotangent groupoid formula_224. In general, given any algebroid orbit formula_225, the image of its cotangent bundle via the dual formula_226 of the anchor map is a symplectic leaf.

For formula_227 one recovers linear Poisson structures, while for formula_228 the fibrewise linear Poisson structure is the nondegenerate one given by the canonical symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle formula_229. More generally, any fibrewise linear Poisson structure on formula_230 that is nondegenerate is isomorphic to the canonical symplectic form on formula_229.

=== Other examples and constructions ===

* Any constant bivector field on a vector space is automatically a Poisson structure; indeed, all three terms in the Jacobiator are zero, being the bracket with a constant function.
*Any bivector field on a 2-dimensional manifold is automatically a Poisson structure; indeed, formula_232 is a 3-vector field, which is always zero in dimension 2.
*Given any Poisson bivector field formula_70 on a 3-dimensional manifold formula_1, the bivector field formula_235, for any formula_236, is automatically Poisson.
*The Cartesian product formula_237 of two Poisson manifolds formula_238 and formula_239 is again a Poisson manifold.
*Let formula_240 be a (regular) foliation of dimension formula_241 on formula_1 and formula_243 a closed foliated two-form for which the power formula_244 is nowhere-vanishing. This uniquely determines a regular Poisson structure on formula_1 by requiring the symplectic leaves of formula_70 to be the leaves formula_115 of formula_240 equipped with the induced symplectic form formula_249.
*Let formula_184 be a Lie group acting on a Poisson manifold formula_162 and such that the Poisson bracket of formula_184-invariant functions on formula_1 is formula_184-invariant. If the action is free and proper, the quotient manifold formula_255 inherits a Poisson structure formula_256 from formula_70 (namely, it is the only one such that the submersion formula_258 is a Poisson map).

== Poisson cohomology ==
The Poisson cohomology groups formula_259 of a Poisson manifold are the cohomology groups of the cochain complexformula_260where the operator formula_261 is the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket with formula_70. Notice that such a sequence can be defined for every bivector formula_70 on formula_1; the condition formula_265 is equivalent to formula_266, i.e. formula_162 being Poisson.

Using the morphism formula_139, one obtains a morphism from the de Rham complex formula_269 to the Poisson complex formula_270, inducing a group homomorphism formula_271. In the nondegenerate case, this becomes an isomorphism, so that the Poisson cohomology of a symplectic manifold fully recovers its de Rham cohomology. 

Poisson cohomology is difficult to compute in general, but the low degree groups contain important geometric information on the Poisson structure: 

* formula_272 is the space of the Casimir functions, i.e. smooth functions Poisson-commuting with all others (or, equivalently, smooth functions constant on the symplectic leaves);
*formula_273 is the space of Poisson vector fields modulo Hamiltonian vector fields;
* formula_274 is the space of the infinitesimal deformations of the Poisson structure modulo trivial deformations;
* formula_275 is the space of the obstructions to extend infinitesimal deformations to actual deformations.
=== Modular class ===
The modular class of a Poisson manifold is a class in the first Poisson cohomology group: for orientable manifolds, it is the obstruction to the existence of a volume form invariant under the Hamiltonian flows. It was introduced by Koszul and Weinstein.

Recall that the divergence of a vector field formula_276 with respect to a given volume form formula_277 is the function formula_278 defined by formula_279. The modular vector field of an orientable Poisson manifold, with respect to a volume form formula_277, is the vector field formula_281 defined by the divergence of the Hamiltonian vector fields: formula_282.

The modular vector field is a Poisson 1-cocycle, i.e. it satisfies formula_283. Moreover, given two volume forms formula_284 and formula_285, the difference formula_286 is a Hamiltonian vector field. Accordingly, the Poisson cohomology class formula_287 does not depend on the original choice of the volume form formula_277, and it is called the modular class of the Poisson manifold.

An orientable Poisson manifold is called unimodular if its modular class vanishes. Notice that this happens if and only if there exists a volume form formula_277 such that the modular vector field formula_281 vanishes, i.e. formula_291 for every formula_292; in other words, formula_277 is invariant under the flow of any Hamiltonian vector field. For instance:

* Symplectic structures are always unimodular, since the Liouville form is invariant under all Hamiltonian vector fields.
* For linear Poisson structures the modular class is the infinitesimal modular character of formula_294, since the modular vector field associated to the standard Lebesgue measure on formula_295 is the constant vector field on formula_295. Then formula_295 is unimodular as Poisson manifold if and only if it is unimodular as Lie algebra.
* For regular Poisson structures the modular class is related to the Reeb class of the underlying symplectic foliation (an element of the first leafwise cohomology group, which obstructs the existence of a volume normal form invariant by vector fields tangent to the foliation).
The construction of the modular class can be easily extended to non-orientable manifolds by replacing volume forms with densities.

=== Poisson homology ===
Poisson cohomology was introduced in 1977 by Lichnerowicz himself; a decade later, Brylinski introduced a homology theory for Poisson manifolds, using the operator formula_298.

Several results have been proved relating Poisson homology and cohomology. For instance, for orientable &quot;unimodular&quot; Poisson manifolds, Poisson homology turns out to be isomorphic to Poisson cohomology: this was proved independently by Xu and Evans-Lu-Weinstein.

==Poisson maps==
A smooth map formula_299 between Poisson manifolds is called a if it respects the Poisson structures, i.e. one of the following equivalent conditions holds (compare with the equivalent definitions of Poisson structures above):

* the Poisson brackets formula_300 and formula_301 satisfy formula_302 for every formula_92 and smooth functions formula_304;
* the bivector fields formula_305 and formula_306 are formula_307-related, i.e. formula_308;

* the Hamiltonian vector fields associated to every smooth function formula_309 are formula_307-related, i.e. formula_311;
* the differential formula_312 is a forward Dirac morphism.

An anti-Poisson map satisfies analogous conditions with a minus sign on one side. 

Poisson manifolds are the objects of a category formula_313, with Poisson maps as morphisms. If a Poisson map formula_314 is also a diffeomorphism, then we call formula_315 a Poisson-diffeomorphism. 
=== Examples ===
* Given a product Poisson manifold formula_237, the canonical projections formula_317, for formula_318, are Poisson maps.
* Given a Poisson manifold formula_162, the inclusion into formula_1 of a symplectic leaf, or of an open subset, is a Poisson map.
*Given two Lie algebras formula_178 and formula_322, the dual of any Lie algebra homomorphism formula_323 induces a Poisson map formula_324 between their linear Poisson structures.
*Given two Lie algebroids formula_325 and formula_326, the dual of any Lie algebroid morphism formula_327 over the identity induces a Poisson map formula_328 between their fibrewise linear Poisson structures.

One should notice that the notion of a Poisson map is fundamentally different from that of a symplectic map. For instance, with their standard symplectic structures, there exist no Poisson maps formula_329, whereas symplectic maps abound. More generally, given two symplectic manifolds formula_330 and formula_331 and a smooth map formula_332, if formula_15 is a Poisson map, it must be a submersion, while if formula_15 is a symplectic map, it must be an immersion.

== Integration of Poisson manifolds ==
Any Poisson manifold formula_162 induces a structure of Lie algebroid on its cotangent bundle formula_336, also called the cotangent algebroid. The anchor map is given by formula_139 while the Lie bracket on formula_338 is defined asformula_339Several notions defined for Poisson manifolds can be interpreted via its Lie algebroid formula_229:

* the symplectic foliation is the usual (singular) foliation induced by the anchor of the Lie algebroid;
*the symplectic leaves are the orbits of the Lie algebroid;
* a Poisson structure on formula_1 is regular precisely when the associated Lie algebroid formula_229 is;
* the Poisson cohomology groups coincide with the Lie algebroid cohomology groups of formula_229 with coefficients in the trivial representation;
* the modular class of a Poisson manifold coincides with the modular class of the associated Lie algebroid formula_229.

It is of crucial importance to notice that the Lie algebroid formula_229 is not always integrable to a Lie groupoid.

=== Symplectic groupoids ===
A is a Lie groupoid formula_222 together with a symplectic form formula_347 which is also multiplicative, i.e. it satisfies the following algebraic compatibility with the groupoid multiplication: formula_348. Equivalently, the graph of formula_349 is asked to be a Lagrangian submanifold of formula_350. Among the several consequences, the dimension of formula_351 is automatically twice the dimension of formula_1. The notion of symplectic groupoid was introduced at the end of the 80&#x27;s independently by several authors.

A fundamental theorem states that the base space of any symplectic groupoid admits a unique Poisson structure formula_70 such that the source map formula_354 and the target map formula_355 are, respectively, a Poisson map and an anti-Poisson map. Moreover, the Lie algebroid formula_356 is isomorphic to the cotangent algebroid formula_229 associated to the Poisson manifold formula_162. Conversely, if the cotangent bundle formula_229 of a Poisson manifold is integrable (as a Lie algebroid), then its formula_360-simply connected integration formula_222 is automatically a symplectic groupoid.

Accordingly, the integrability problem for a Poisson manifold consists in finding a (symplectic) Lie groupoid which integrates its cotangent algebroid; when this happens, the Poisson structure is called integrable.

While any Poisson manifold admits a local integration (i.e. a symplectic groupoid where the multiplication is defined only locally), there are general topological obstructions to its integrability, coming from the integrability theory for Lie algebroids. The candidate formula_362 for the symplectic groupoid integrating any given Poisson manifold formula_162 is called Poisson homotopy groupoid and is simply the Ševera-Weinstein groupoid of the cotangent algebroid formula_336, consisting of the quotient of the Banach space of a special class of paths in formula_229 by a suitable equivalent relation. Equivalently, formula_362 can be described as an infinite-dimensional symplectic quotient.

=== Examples of integrations ===

* The trivial Poisson structure formula_367 is always integrable, a symplectic groupoid being the bundle of abelian (additive) groups formula_368 with the canonical symplectic structure.
* A nondegenerate Poisson structure on formula_1 is always integrable, a symplectic groupoid being the pair groupoid formula_370 together with the symplectic form formula_371 (for formula_372).
* A Lie-Poisson structure on formula_183 is always integrable, a symplectic groupoid being the (coadjoint) action groupoid formula_374, for formula_184 a Lie group integrating formula_178, together with the canonical symplectic form of formula_377.
* A Lie-Poisson structure on formula_201 is integrable if and only if the Lie algebroid formula_325 is integrable to a Lie groupoid formula_222, a symplectic groupoid being the cotangent groupoid formula_381 with the canonical symplectic form.

=== Symplectic realisations ===
A (full) symplectic realisation on a Poisson manifold M consists of a symplectic manifold formula_382 together with a Poisson map formula_383 which is a surjective submersion. Roughly speaking, the role of a symplectic realisation is to &quot;desingularise&quot; a complicated (degenerate) Poisson manifold by passing to a bigger, but easier (nondegenerate), one.

A symplectic realisation formula_384 is called complete if, for any complete Hamiltonian vector field formula_385, the vector field formula_386 is complete as well. While symplectic realisations always exist for every Poisson manifold (and several different proofs are available), complete ones do not, and their existence plays a fundamental role in the integrability problem for Poisson manifolds. Indeed, using the topological obstructions to the integrability of Lie algebroids, one can show that a Poisson manifold is integrable if and only if it admits a complete symplectic realisation. This fact can also be proved more directly, without using Crainic-Fernandes obstructions.

== Poisson submanifolds ==
A Poisson submanifold of formula_387 is an immersed submanifold formula_388 together with a Poisson structure formula_389 such that the immersion map formula_390 is a Poisson map. Alternatively, one can require one of the following equivalent conditions:

* the image of formula_391 is inside formula_392 for every formula_393;
* the formula_83-orthogonal formula_395 vanishes, where formula_396 denotes the annihilator of formula_397;
* every Hamiltonian vector field formula_398, for formula_236, is tangent to formula_400.

=== Examples ===
* Given any Poisson manifold formula_401, its symplectic leaves formula_402 are Poisson submanifolds.
* Given any Poisson manifold formula_401 and a Casimir function formula_404, its level sets formula_405, with formula_277 any regular value of formula_292, are Poisson submanifolds (actually they are unions of symplectic leaves).
* Consider a Lie algebra formula_294 and the Lie-Poisson structure on formula_295. If formula_294 is compact, its Killing form defines an formula_411-invariant inner product on formula_294, hence an formula_413-invariant inner product formula_414 on formula_295. Then the sphere formula_416 is a Poisson submanifold for every formula_417, being a union of coadjoint orbits (which are the symplectic leaves of the Lie-Poisson structure). This can be checked equivalently after noticing that formula_418 for the Casimir function formula_419.

=== Other types of submanifolds in Poisson geometry ===
The definition of Poisson submanifold is very natural and satisfies several good properties, e.g. the transverse intersection of two Poisson submanifolds is again a Poisson submanifold. However, it does not behave well functorially: if formula_420 is a Poisson map transverse to a Poisson submanifold formula_421, the submanifold formula_422 is not necessarily Poisson. In order to overcome this problem, one can use the notion of Poisson transversals (originally called cosymplectic submanifolds). A Poisson transversal is a submanifold formula_423 which is transverse to every symplectic leaf formula_109 and such that the intersection formula_425 is a symplectic submanifold of formula_426. It follows that any Poisson transversal formula_423 inherits a canonical Poisson structure formula_428 from formula_70. In the case of a nondegenerate Poisson manifold formula_387 (whose only symplectic leaf is formula_1 itself), Poisson transversals are the same thing as symplectic submanifolds.

Another important generalisation of Poisson submanifolds is given by coisotropic submanifolds, introduced by Weinstein in order to &quot;extend the lagrangian calculus from symplectic to Poisson manifolds&quot;. A coisotropic submanifold is a submanifold formula_432 such that the formula_83-orthogonal formula_434 is a subspace of formula_435. For instance, given a smooth map formula_420, its graph is a coisotropic submanifold of formula_437 if and only if formula_438 is a Poisson map. Similarly, given a Lie algebra formula_294 and a vector subspace formula_440, its annihilator formula_441 is a coisotropic submanifold of the Lie-Poisson structure on formula_295 if and only if formula_443 is a Lie subalgebra. In general, coisotropic submanifolds such that formula_444 recover Poisson submanifolds, while for nondegenerate Poisson structures, coisotropic submanifolds boil down to the classical notion of coisotropic submanifold in symplectic geometry.

Other classes of submanifolds which play an important role in Poisson geometry include Lie–Dirac submanifolds, Poisson–Dirac submanifolds and pre-Poisson submanifolds.

== Further topics ==

=== Deformation quantisation ===
The main idea of deformation quantisation is to deform the (commutative) algebra of functions on a Poisson manifold into a non-commutative one, in order to investigate the passage from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. This topic was one of the driving forces for the development of Poisson geometry, and the precise notion of formal deformation quantisation was developed already in 1978.

A (differential) star product on a manifold formula_26 is an associative, unital and formula_446-bilinear productformula_447on the ring formula_448 of formal power series, of the formformula_449where formula_450 is a family of bidifferential operators on formula_26 such that formula_452 is the pointwise multiplication formula_453.

The expression formula_454 defines a Poisson bracket on formula_26, which can be interpreted as the &quot;classical limit&quot; of the star product formula_456 when the formal parameter formula_457 (denoted with same symbol as the reduced Planck&#x27;s constant) goes to zero, i.e.

formula_458

A (formal) deformation quantisation of a Poisson manifold formula_401 is a star product formula_456 such that the Poisson bracket formula_461 coincide with formula_462. Several classes of Poisson manifolds have been shown to admit a canonical deformation quantisations:

* formula_25 with the canonical Poisson bracket (or, more generally, any finite-dimensional vector space with a constant Poisson bracket) admits the Moyal-Weyl product;
* the dual formula_295 of any Lie algebra formula_294, with the Lie-Poisson structure, admits the Gutt star product;
* any nondegenerate Poisson manifold admits a deformation quantisation. This was shown first for symplectic manifolds with a flat symplectic connection, and then in general by de Wilde and Lecompte, while a more explicit approach was provided later by Fedosov and several other authors.

In general, building a deformation quantisation for any given Poisson manifold is a highly non trivial problem, and for several years it was not clear if it would be even possible. In 1997 Kontsevich provided a quantisation formula, which shows that every Poisson manifoldformula_401 admits a canonical deformation quantisation; this contributed to getting him the Fields medal in 1998.

Kontsevich&#x27;s proof relies on an algebraic result, known as the formality conjecture, which involves a quasi-isomorphism of differential graded Lie algebras between the multivector fields formula_467 (with Schouten bracket and zero differential) and the multidifferential operators formula_468 (with Gerstenhaber bracket and Hochschild differential). Alternative approaches and more direct constructions of Kontsevich&#x27;s deformation quantisation were later provided by other authors.

=== Linearisation problem ===
The isotropy Lie algebra of a Poisson manifold formula_387 at a point formula_92 is the isotropy Lie algebra formula_471 of its cotangent Lie algebroid formula_229; explicitly, its Lie bracket is given by formula_473. If, furthermore, formula_161 is a zero of formula_70, i.e. formula_476, then formula_477 is the entire cotangent space. Due to the correspondence between Lie algebra structures on formula_167 and linear Poisson structures, there is an induced linear Poisson structure on formula_479, denoted by formula_480. A Poisson manifold formula_387 is called (smoothly) linearisable at a zero formula_92 if there exists a Poisson diffeomorphism between formula_387 and formula_484 which sends formula_161 to formula_486.

It is in general a difficult problem to determine if a given Poisson manifold is linearisable, and in many instances the answer is negative. For instance, if the isotropy Lie algebra of formula_387 at a zero formula_92 is isomorphic to the special linear Lie algebra formula_489, then formula_387 is not linearisable at formula_161. Other counterexamples arise when the isotropy Lie algebra is a semisimple Lie algebra of real rank at least 2, or when it is a semisimple Lie algebra of rank 1 whose compact part (in the Cartan decomposition) is not semisimple.

A notable sufficient condition for linearisability is provided by Conn&#x27;s linearisation theorem:Let formula_387 be a Poisson manifold and formula_92 a zero of formula_70. If the isotropy Lie algebra formula_495 is semisimple and compact, then formula_387 is linearisable around formula_161.In the previous counterexample, indeed, formula_489 is semisimple but not compact. The original proof of Conn involves several estimates from analysis in order to apply the Nash-Moser theorem; a different proof, employing geometric methods which were not available at Conn&#x27;s time, was provided by Crainic and Fernandes.

If one restricts to analytic Poisson manifolds, a similar linearisation theorem holds, only requiring the isotropy Lie algebra formula_495 to be semisimple. This was conjectured by Weinstein and proved by Conn before his result in the smooth category; a more geometric proof was given by Zung. Several other particular cases when the linearisation problem has a positive answer have been proved in the formal, smooth or analytic category.

=== Poisson-Lie groups ===
A Poisson-Lie group is a Lie group formula_500 together with a Poisson structure compatible with the multiplication map. This condition can be formulated in a number of equivalent ways:

* the multiplication formula_501 is a Poisson map, with respect to the product Poisson structure on formula_502;
* the Poisson bracket satisfies formula_503 for every formula_504 and formula_505, where formula_506 and formula_507 are the right- and left-translations of formula_500;
* the Poisson bivector field formula_83 is a multiplicative tensor, i.e. it satisfies formula_510 for every formula_504.

It follows from the last characterisation that the Poisson bivector field formula_83 of a Poisson-Lie group always vanishes at the unit formula_513. Accordingly, a non-trivial Poisson-Lie group cannot arise from a symplectic structure, otherwise it would contradict Weinstein splitting theorem applied to &quot;formula_514&quot;; for the same reason, formula_83 cannot even be of constant rank.

Infinitesimally, a Poisson-Lie group formula_500 induces a comultiplication formula_517 on its Lie algebra formula_518, obtained by linearising the Poisson bivector field formula_519 at the unit formula_513, i.e. formula_521. The comultiplication formula_522 endows formula_294 with a structure of Lie coalgebra, which is moreover compatible with the original Lie algebra structure, making formula_294 into a Lie bialgebra. Moreover, Drinfeld proved that there is an equivalence of categories between simply connected Poisson-Lie groups and finite-dimensional Lie bialgebras, extending the classical equivalence between simply connected Lie groups and finite-dimensional Lie algebras.

Weinstein generalised Poisson-Lie groups to Poisson(-Lie) groupoids, which are Lie groupoids formula_525 with a compatible Poisson structure on the space of arrows formula_500. This can be formalised by saying that the graph of the multiplication defines a coisotropic submanifold of formula_527, or in other equivalent ways. Moreover, Mackenzie and Xu extended Drinfeld&#x27;s correspondence to a correspondence between Poisson groupoids and Lie bialgebroids.

<doc id="882909" wikidata="Q3212874" url="?curid=882909" title="I Only Have Eyes for You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; is episode 19 of season two of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It was written by Marti Noxon, directed by James Whitmore Jr., and first broadcast on April 28, 1998, on The WB. In the episode, Sunnydale High is haunted by the ghosts of a teacher and a student who fell in love years ago, recreating their tragedy by possessing the bodies of students and staff preparing for the upcoming Sadie Hawkins dance.

Written as a ghost story dealing with the themes of second chance and regret, the episode received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Buffy stops a male student from shooting a female student. Afterwards, they have no recollection of why they were arguing and the gun disappears. Principal Snyder blames Buffy for the incident. While waiting in his office, a yearbook from 1955 falls off the shelf. In class later that day, Buffy starts daydreaming about a relationship that a student had with his teacher. As she comes back to the present, she finds that her teacher has unknowingly written &quot;Don&#x27;t walk away from me, bitch!&quot; on the black board, a line the male student had shouted. Later, Xander is grabbed by a monster arm from inside his locker. Buffy helps him break away, but the arm then disappears.

Giles is intrigued by the possible presence of a poltergeist. Later that night, Giles sees the janitor shoot a teacher, though only moments earlier they were cordial. Giles is convinced that Jenny Calendar is haunting the school.

Willow finds information on her laptop about a killing in 1955, where student James Stanley killed his teacher Grace Newman after she tried to break off their affair. In the cafeteria, chaos erupts as the food turns into snakes. Outside, Snyder talks to the police chief about the incident and it is revealed that they know about the Hellmouth under the school and the possibility of Buffy being the Slayer. Drusilla gets a vision about Buffy meeting with death.

Willow devises a plan to contain the spirits, and they head off to the school where they prepare, though Giles has already arrived and is trying to summon Jenny&#x27;s spirit. Buffy hears music coming from the music room and sees Grace and James dancing there. James&#x27; face suddenly changes to a gory mess, startling Buffy. On the stairwell, Willow begins to sink into the floor and Giles saves her. Willow finally convinces him that the spirit is not Jenny. A swarm of wasps arrives and surrounds the school.

Everyone recuperates at Buffy&#x27;s while she continues to show her anger towards James. Buffy goes to the kitchen where she finds a sign for the 1955 Sadie Hawkins dance in her pocket as James&#x27; voice whispers, &quot;I need you.&quot; She heads to the school where the wasps part for her to enter. Willow finds the ad and everyone rushes after Buffy, but they cannot enter the school.

Angelus appears in the halls as Buffy, now possessed by James, talks to him as if he were Grace. They repeat the ghosts&#x27; argument until, at the climax, Buffy pulls out a gun and shoots Angelus. He falls off of the balcony as though dead. Buffy, still possessed by James, goes to the music room where &quot;James&quot; plans to kill himself. The possessed Angelus arrives just in time to stop Buffy from pulling the trigger. They exchange apologies and kiss. The spirits leave their bodies and are finally finding peace. Buffy and Angelus break away from the kiss, and Angelus, disgusted at what he has been doing, pushes Buffy away and flees. Angelus and Drusilla leave Spike after Angelus taunts him and Spike breaks free from his wheelchair.

==Production details==
Scriptwriter Marti Noxon said that prior to working on &quot;Buffy&quot;, she had written several times about ghosts, which for her are figurative expressions of the need for &quot;repentance and second chances&quot;, drawing on her own family background. &quot;I realize that I was constantly telling the story of my family and fears,&quot; she says. Noxon was influenced in her storytelling by the movies &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot;, which featured a widow who was unable to move on after the loss of her husband.

==Cultural references==
In the episode &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight,&quot; their English class discussed William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Here, Xander alludes to the play by saying, &quot;The quality of mercy is not Buffy.&quot;

When Willow suggests an exorcism of the ghosts, Cordelia replies, &quot;Are you crazy? I saw that movie. Even the priest died!&quot; She refers to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

The website Women at Warp compares the &quot;past love affair gone bad plays out again and again&quot; theme with the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Eye of the Beholder.&quot; &quot;In both episodes, the spirit left behind by a man whose love affair turned tragic inhabits the minds of key female characters. When Troi investigates a crew member&#x27;s suicide, she becomes entranced by the telepathic memory of Lt. Pierce, who killed his lover and then killed himself. Seeing through his eyes, she seems to live out his memories, killing Lt. Worf then attempting to kill herself. In the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, the ghost of a young man who—that&#x27;s right—killed his lover then himself, causes Buffy to attempt to act out the same events with her lover, Angel. Both are ultimately saved by the lovers they thought they murdered.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Vox&quot; rated it #45 in a list of all 144 episodes, writing, &quot;The smart, moving twist, as penned by Marti Noxon, is that when Buffy and Angel (excuse me, Angelus) end up possessed, the gender roles are reversed, with Buffy consumed by the guilt and self-loathing James feels for killing the person he loved. It&#x27;s an unexpected, effective window into Buffy&#x27;s psyche in the aftermath of Angel&#x27;s transformation, and while James&#x27;s spirit eventually makes peace with his actions, the episode shows Buffy still has a long way to go toward forgiving herself for her part in Angel losing his soul.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described the episode as &quot;a really beautiful episode that raises the subtext of the season to the surface in a surprising and emotionally powerful way&quot; and &quot;a story about obsession and repetition&quot;. BBC praised the direction and the script, and said that &quot;it&#x27;s impossible not to be charmed by the whole picture. The ending, where Buffy and Angel re-enact James and Grace&#x27;s final moments, is such a compelling twist that it suddenly seems that the rest of the episode was written to explain the finale, rather than the other way around.&quot; The review opined that the final scene of the episode, in which Spike regained his health, was a &quot;very welcome development&quot; but also an &quot;ill-judged addition&quot; because it broke the &quot;spell&quot; of the screenplay, and because it teased the season finale, it should have been used in the next episode.

<text>Derrick Vincent Thomas (January 1, 1967 – February 8, 2000), nicknamed &quot;D. T.&quot;, was an American professional football linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Considered one of the greatest pass rushers of all time, he played 11 seasons with the Chiefs until his death in 2000. Thomas played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where he won the Butkus Award, and was selected fourth overall by Kansas City in the 1989 NFL draft. During his career, he received nine Pro Bowl and two first-team All-Pro selections, and set the single-game sacks record.

After the Chiefs&#x27; 1999 season, Thomas was rendered paraplegic by a car crash and died two weeks later from a pulmonary embolism. He was posthumously inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Born in Miami, Florida, Thomas was raised by his mother Edith Morgan. His father, Air Force Captain and B-52 pilot Robert James Thomas, died during a mission in the Vietnam War when Derrick was five years old. Thomas played his high school football at South Miami Senior High School.

==College career==
Alongside Cornelius Bennett and later Keith McCants at Alabama, Thomas spearheaded one of the best defensive lines in college football and smashed many Crimson Tide defensive records, including sacks in a single season. He was awarded the Butkus Award in 1988. He was also selected as a consensus All-American at the conclusion of the 1988 season, a season which culminated in the Crimson Tide&#x27;s thrilling 29–28 victory over Army in the 1988 Sun Bowl. In 2000, Thomas was named a Sun Bowl Legend. He was awarded the Sington Soaring Spirit Award by the Lakeshore Foundation. This annual award is named for University of Alabama football legend Fred Sington. Thomas was posthumously inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Professional career==
Thomas was selected fourth overall in the first round of the 1989 NFL draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. He was the first selection made by new head coach Marty Schottenheimer.

Thomas would record his first career sack in the Chiefs week 2 game against the Los Angeles Raiders. That game was also his first multi-sack game as he finished with 2.5 sacks. He would record another 7.5 sacks that season finishing with 10 his rookie year. He was named AP Defensive Rookie of the Year. He was also named to the Pro Bowl.

In his second year, Thomas recorded at least a half of a sack in each of the Chiefs first 5 games. In the Chiefs week 10 game against the Seattle Seahawks, he broke Fred Dean&#x27;s 7-year-old record of sacks in a single game with 7 sacks. The quarterback he sacked in that game, Dave Krieg, would become his teammate 2 seasons later. However, on the game&#x27;s final play, Thomas had a clear shot for an eighth sack, but missed it and the Seahawks would throw a game winning touchdown after the missed sack. He would later call that play the one play in his career he wished he could have a second chance at. He would finish the season with what would prove to be a career high 20 sacks, setting a franchise record that stood until it was broken by Justin Houston in 2014. He finished 2nd in defensive player of the year voting and was named 1st team All-Pro.

The following season, he would record his first career touchdown on a 23-yard fumble return for a touchdown in the Chiefs week 11 game against the Los Angeles Rams.

Thomas would record double digits sacks for each of the first four seasons in his career. In total, 7 of his 11 seasons in the NFL he recorded double digit sack totals.

In the Chiefs 1999 season, Thomas recorded a career low for sacks with 7. He would also record his first career interception in the Chiefs week 8 win over the San Diego Chargers. He would record the final sack of his career in the Chiefs week 15 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In what would be the final game of his career, as he would die 37 days later, the Chiefs played their rival the Oakland Raiders. With a victory in the game, the Chiefs would qualify for the playoffs. The Chiefs lost in overtime 41–38. He didn&#x27;t manage to record a sack on his former teammate Rich Gannon, but he did record 6 total tackles.

===Legacy===
Thomas was named first-team All-Pro two times and was named to the Pro Bowl nine times. He is 18th all-time in sacks and at the time of his death in 2000, he was 9th all-time with 126.5. He remains the Chiefs&#x27; all-time leader in sacks, safeties, forced fumbles, and fumble recoveries. During his career, he recorded 1 interception and recovered 19 fumbles, returning them for 161 yards and 4 touchdowns. Thomas said in interviews his favorite quarterback to sack was Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, whom he sacked 26 times. The sack total over Elway is most against any quarterback in Thomas&#x27; career and the most any individual player sacked Elway. He was posthumously inducted into the Chiefs Hall of Fame in 2000, with the Chiefs breaking the tradition of waiting four years after the end of the player&#x27;s career. In 2009, he was posthumously inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Later that same year, the Chiefs retired the number 58 in honor of him. Following his death until it was officially retired, the Chiefs did not reissue the number. The Chiefs also named their player of the year award in Thomas&#x27; honor, an award he won twice himself prior to the award being named in his honor. He is the only NFL player to die during their career that was later inducted to the Hall of Fame.

==Death==
On January 23, 2000, Thomas&#x27;s SUV went off Interstate 435 in Clay County as he and two passengers were driving to Kansas City International Airport during a snowstorm for a flight to St. Louis to see the NFC Championship Game between the St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Police reports indicated that Thomas, who was driving, was speeding at approximately 70 mph even though snow and ice were rapidly accumulating on the roadway. Thomas and one of the passengers were not wearing seat belts and both were thrown from the car; the passenger, Michael Tellis, was killed instantly. The second passenger, who was wearing his safety belt, walked away from the scene uninjured. Thomas was left paralyzed from the chest down. By early February, Thomas was being treated at Miami&#x27;s Jackson Memorial Hospital. The morning of February 8, 2000, while being transferred from his hospital bed to a wheelchair on his way to therapy, Thomas told his mother he was not feeling well. His eyes then rolled back, recalled Frank Eismont, an orthopedic surgeon at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Eismont said Thomas went into cardiorespiratory arrest and died as a result of a pulmonary embolism, a massive blood clot that developed in his legs and traveled to his lungs. Months later, Thomas&#x27;s family sued General Motors for $73 million in damages stemming from the accident. In 2004, a jury ruled that the family was not entitled to any money.

==Charity work==
In 1990, Thomas founded the Derrick Thomas Third and Long Foundation. The foundation&#x27;s mission is to &quot;sack illiteracy&quot; and change the lives of 9- to 13-year-old urban children facing challenging and life-threatening situations in the Kansas City area.

The Derrick Thomas Academy, a charter school in Kansas City, Missouri, opened in September 2001. It served nearly 1,000 children from kindergarten through eighth grade until it closed in 2013.

<text>Alfred Herman Duerr (born January 29, 1951) is a former Canadian politician who served as the 34th mayor of Calgary, Alberta from 1989 to 2001, and a city alderman from 1983 to 1989.

==Early life and education==
Duerr was born January 29, 1951, in Humboldt, Saskatchewan, the fourth of six children. He attended Humboldt Collegiate.

Duerr graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with a degree in regional and urban development in 1973. He holds a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Calgary.

==Political career==
Duerr was first elected as an alderman for Ward 9 on Calgary City Council in 1983 and was re-elected in 1986. Incumbent Mayor Ralph Klein resigned in the months before the 1989 municipal election to pursue provincial office and Duerr contested and won the mayor&#x27;s seat in the 1989 election. Duerr would go on to be re-elected as mayor three more times in 1992, 1995, and 1998 before deciding not to contest the 2001 election, which was won by former Alderman Dave Bronconnier.

Duerr&#x27;s time as mayor coincided with significant spending cuts by the federal government and austerity policies by Ralph Klein&#x27;s provincial government. Provincial austerity would result in a significant reduction in grant funding for municipalities which in turn resulted in lower capital spending and public construction projects in Calgary.

In 1991, Duerr would proclaim gay pride week in Calgary; however, he would deny future proclamations due to public pressure.

During his four terms, Duerr was considered one of the most popular mayors in the city&#x27;s history. His conciliatory, managerial style and likeable personality made him well respected. Duerr was given the nickname of &quot;Mr. Beige&quot; by local media columnists, and in the 1998 election would be challenged by local political columnist Rick Bell, although Bell&#x27;s candidacy was not a serious attempt to contest the mayor&#x27;s office.

In 1997 while serving as mayor, Duerr played the character of Mayor Wilkins in an episode of the television show Viper.

==Later life==
He is the Chief Executive Officer of Emergo Projects International, and serves on the board of directors for two other companies in Calgary. He is a member of the Community and Partners Advisory Committee of the Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta.

In 2014, Duerr was appointed Chair of the independent Calgary Ward Boundary Commission to examine the boundaries of Calgary City Council wards in time for the 2017 Calgary municipal election. The Commission recommended against increasing the number of councillors for the City and instead recommended creating satellite offices for larger constituencies and increasing the budget of the councillor&#x27;s office.

==Personal life==
Duerr is married to Kit Chan and has two children.

<doc id="882935" wikidata="Q1801765" url="?curid=882935" title="Dana Stubblefield">
<text>Dana William Stubblefield (born November 14, 1970) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks.

==Early life==
After graduating from Taylor High School in North Bend, Ohio, Stubblefield attended the University of Kansas. 

==Professional career==
Stubblefield was selected in the first round (26th overall) of the 1993 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers who went to a 4–3 defense at the start of the season. In his rookie year, Stubblefield led the 49ers with 10.5 sacks (earning himself the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year), and recorded 8.5 the following year. He appeared in the Pro Bowl in 1994 and 1995. The 1996 season was less successful for Stubblefield, but his 1997 season found him recording 15 sacks and being named 1997&#x27;s NFL Defensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press.

After the 1997 season, he became an unrestricted free agent and signed with the Washington Redskins, where his numbers greatly diminished despite the fact that he played opposite Dan Wilkinson, who often drew double-teams. He returned to San Francisco in 2001 and 2002, and played with the Oakland Raiders as a free agent in 2003. In 2004, he was signed by the New England Patriots, but he was injured and was released before the start of the season.

===BALCO incident===
Stubblefield&#x27;s name and those of several of his Oakland Raiders team members were found on the list of clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative that had given performance-enhancing drugs to Marion Jones and others. Although initially he lied to federal investigators about using both EPO and THG, after he was charged on January 18, 2008, Stubblefield cooperated with both federal and NFL investigators and turned over the names of players, agents, and trainers that he suspected of using drugs.

Because of his cooperation with the investigation, he received a fairly light sentence after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators on February 6, 2009. He served two years&#x27; probation.

==Personal life==
He was formerly the varsity defensive line coach at Valley Christian High School in San Jose, California.

On October 12, 2010, former NFL agent Josh Luchs mentioned in an article for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that he offered Stubblefield $10,000 cash while he was still playing football at the University of Kansas, but Stubblefield refused to accept it.

===Legal problems===

On December 9, 2010, San Francisco U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston sentenced Stubblefield to 90 days in jail for stealing his ex-girlfriend&#x27;s mail by way of fraudulent submission of a change-of-address form.

On May 2, 2016, he was charged with sexually assaulting a disabled woman, who at the time of the incident was 31 years old. The incident occurred April 9, 2015. Stubblefield originally contacted her through a babysitter website. On July 27, 2020, Stubblefield was convicted of rape and on October 22, 2020, was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. In December 2024, a court overturned Stubblefield&#x27;s conviction on appeal, as the prosecution was found to be in violation of the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, which forbids racially biased language and rhetoric from cases made by prosecutors.

<text>In mathematics, Nambu mechanics is a generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics involving multiple Hamiltonians. Recall that Hamiltonian mechanics is based upon the flows generated by a smooth Hamiltonian over a symplectic manifold. The flows are symplectomorphisms and hence obey Liouville&#x27;s theorem. This was soon generalized to flows generated by a Hamiltonian over a Poisson manifold. In 1973, Yoichiro Nambu suggested a generalization involving Nambu–Poisson manifolds with more than one Hamiltonian.

== Nambu bracket ==
Specifically, consider a differential manifold , for some integer ; one has a smooth -linear map from copies of to itself, such that it is completely antisymmetric: 
the Nambu bracket,

:formula_1

which acts as a derivation

:formula_2

whence the Filippov Identities (FI) (evocative of the Jacobi identities,
but unlike them, &quot;not&quot; antisymmetrized in all arguments, for ):

formula_3 formula_4

so that acts as a generalized derivation over the -fold product .

== Hamiltonians and flow ==
There are &quot;N&quot; − 1 Hamiltonians, , generating an incompressible flow,

:formula_5

The generalized phase-space velocity is divergenceless, enabling Liouville&#x27;s theorem. The case reduces to a Poisson manifold, and conventional Hamiltonian mechanics.

For larger even , the Hamiltonians identify with the maximal number of independent invariants of motion (cf. Conserved quantity) characterizing a superintegrable system that evolves in -dimensional phase space. Such systems are also describable by conventional Hamiltonian dynamics; but their description in the framework of Nambu mechanics is substantially more elegant and intuitive, as all invariants enjoy the &quot;same&quot; geometrical status as the Hamiltonian: the trajectory in phase space is the intersection of the hypersurfaces specified by these invariants. Thus, the flow is perpendicular to all gradients of these Hamiltonians, whence parallel to the generalized cross product specified by the respective Nambu bracket.

Nambu mechanics can be extended to fluid dynamics, where the resulting Nambu brackets are non-canonical and the Hamiltonians are identified with the Casimir of the system, such as enstrophy or helicity. 
Quantizing Nambu dynamics leads to intriguing structures that coincide with conventional quantization ones when superintegrable systems are involved—as they must.

<doc id="882939" wikidata="Q763575" url="?curid=882939" title="Parallel communication">
<text>In data transmission, parallel communication is a method of conveying multiple binary digits (bits) simultaneously using multiple conductors. This contrasts with serial communication, which conveys only a single bit at a time; this distinction is one way of characterizing a communications link.

The basic difference between a parallel and a serial communication channel is the number of electrical conductors used at the physical layer to convey bits. Parallel communication implies more than one such conductor. For example, an 8-bit parallel channel will convey eight bits (or a byte) simultaneously, whereas a serial channel would convey those same bits sequentially, one at a time. If both channels operated at the same clock speed, the parallel channel would be eight times faster. A parallel channel may have additional conductors for other signals, such as a clock signal to pace the flow of data, a signal to control the direction of data flow, and handshaking signals.

Parallel communication is and always has been widely used within integrated circuits, in peripheral buses, and in memory devices such as RAM. Computer system buses, on the other hand, have evolved over time: parallel communication was commonly used in earlier system buses, whereas serial communications are prevalent in modern computers.

==Examples of parallel communication systems==
* Internal buses: memory bus, system bus, and front-side bus, including various generations of DDR SDRAM and GDDR SDRAM
* IBM System/360 &quot;Direct Control Feature&quot; (1964). Standard System/360 had an eight-bit wide port. The process-control variant Model 44 had a 32-bit width.
* Legacy computer peripheral buses: ISA, ATA, SCSI, PCI, and the once-ubiquitous IEEE-1284 / Centronics &quot;printer port&quot;
* Laboratory Instrumentation bus IEEE-488
* (see more examples at computer bus)

==Comparison with serial links==
Before the development of high-speed serial technologies, the choice of parallel links over serial links was driven by these factors:

* Speed: Superficially, the speed of a parallel data link is equal to the number of bits sent at one time times the bit rate of each individual path; doubling the number of bits sent at once doubles the data rate. In practice, clock skew reduces the speed of every link to the slowest of all of the links. However, parallel lines have lower latency than serial lines, this makes parallel lines is still used on memory bus like DDR SDRAM.
* Cable length or link length: Crosstalk creates interference between the parallel lines, and the effect worsens with the length of the communication link. This places an upper limit on the length of a parallel data connection that is usually shorter than a serial connection.
* Complexity: Parallel data links are easily implemented in hardware, making them a logical choice. Creating a parallel port in a computer system is relatively simple, requiring only a latch to copy data onto a data bus. In contrast, most serial communication must first be converted back into parallel form by a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) before they may be directly connected to a data bus.

The decreasing cost and better performance of integrated circuits has led to serial links being used in favor of parallel links; for example, IEEE 1284 printer ports vs. USB, Parallel ATA vs. Serial ATA, and FireWire or Thunderbolt are now the most common connectors for transferring data from audiovisual (AV) devices such as digital cameras or professional-grade scanners that used to require purchasing a SCSI HBA years ago.

One huge advantage of having fewer wires/pins in a serial cable is the significant reduction in the size, the complexity of the connectors, and the associated costs. Designers of devices such as smartphones benefit from the development of connectors/ports that are small, durable, and still provide adequate performance.

On the other hand, there has been a resurgence of parallel data links in RF communication. Rather than transmitting one bit at a time (as in Morse code and BPSK), well-known techniques such as PSM, PAM, and Multiple-input multiple-output communication send a few bits in parallel. (Each such group of bits is called a &quot;symbol&quot;). Such techniques can be extended to send an entire byte at once (256-QAM).

<doc id="882940" wikidata="Q506401" url="?curid=882940" title="Bil Keane">
<text>William Aloysius Keane (October 5, 1922 – November 8, 2011) was an American cartoonist best known for the newspaper comic strip &quot;The Family Circus&quot;. He began it in 1960 and his son Jeff Keane continues to produce it.

==Early life and education==
Keane was born in Crescentville, a neighborhood in Philadelphia, and attended parochial school at St. William Parish and Northeast Catholic High School. While a schoolboy, he taught himself to draw by mimicking the style of the cartoons published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His first cartoon was published on May 21, 1936, on the amateur page of the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;. While in high school, he signed his work &quot;Bill Keane&quot;, but omitted the second L from his first name early in his career, in order &quot;to be distinctive&quot;.

==Career==
Keane served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945, during which he drew for &quot;Yank&quot; and created the feature &quot;At Ease with the Japanese&quot; for the Pacific edition of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;.

From 1946 to 1959 Keane worked as a staff artist for the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;, where he launched his first regular comic strip &quot;Silly Philly&quot;. His first syndicated strip, &quot;Channel Chuckles&quot;, a series of jokes about television, premiered in 1954 and ran until 1977. In 1959, the Keane family moved to Paradise Valley, Arizona. Keane&#x27;s daily newspaper panel &quot;The Family Circus&quot; premiered on February 29, 1960. He was president of the National Cartoonists Society from 1981 to 1983 and was the master of ceremonies at the Society&#x27;s annual awards banquet for 16 years.

From 1981 to 1983, Keane published the gag strip &quot;Eggheads&quot; in collaboration with his son Jeff, who now draws and writes &quot;The Family Circus&quot;. Like his father, Jeff Keane has been president of the National Cartoonists Society, serving four years thereat.

==Personal life==
While stationed in Australia he met Thelma &quot;Thel&quot; Carne. They were married in Brisbane, Queensland in 1948 and settled in Roslyn, Pennsylvania. They had five children: Gayle, Neal, Glen, Christopher and Jeff. Glen is an animator and has drawn much notice for his work for Walt Disney Animation Studios. Jeff is a cartoonist and took over his father&#x27;s comic strip upon the latter&#x27;s death. Thel, the inspiration for Mommy in &quot;The Family Circus&quot;, died on May 23, 2008 from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. 

Keane and his wife owned a second residence in Laguna Beach, California.

Bil Keane died on November 8, 2011, at his home in Paradise Valley, Arizona, near Phoenix, at age 89. The cause of death was given as congestive heart failure. A Catholic, he was buried beside his wife in the Holy Redeemer Cemetery of Phoenix, Arizona.

==Awards==
Keane received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Award for Best Syndicated Panel four times, in 1967, 1971, 1973 and 1974. In 1981, he was awarded the Inkpot Award. In 1982, he was named the Society&#x27;s Cartoonist of the Year and received the Reuben Award, the Society&#x27;s top honor. That year he also received the Elzie Segar Award for his unique contribution to the cartooning profession. 

In 1998, Keane became the tenth recipient of the Arizona Heritage Award, joining—among others—Barry Goldwater, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Mo Udall and Erma Bombeck. In 2002 Keane was honored with the Silver T-Square Award from the National Cartoonist Society for &quot;outstanding dedication&quot; to the Society and the cartooning profession. In 2008, he received the Sergio Award from the Comic Art Professional Society.

==Friends==
Keane was close friends with humorist and newspaper columnist Erma Bombeck. He provided illustrations for Bombeck&#x27;s book &quot;Just Wait Until You Have Children of Your Own!&quot; (1972), and considered himself instrumental in convincing Bombeck and her family to move to Arizona near his home. He was a pallbearer at Bombeck&#x27;s funeral in 1996.

Stephan Pastis, creator of &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;, acknowledged he was good friends with Keane and Keane&#x27;s son, Jeff. Pastis has parodied &quot;The Family Circus&quot; in his own strip several times, and Keane wrote a satirical &quot;attack&quot; on these jokes as a foreword for Pastis&#x27; &quot;Pearls&quot; collection &quot;Macho Macho Animals&quot;.

In the comic strip switcheroo of 1997, Keane switched strips with Scott Adams of &quot;Dilbert&quot; . Adams said, &quot;Bil was a misunderstood creative genius who knew how to write for his target audience. He was also a great guy. I was a big fan.&quot;

Keane also counted fellow cartoonists Charles M. Schulz (&quot;Peanuts&quot;) and Mell Lazarus (&quot;Miss Peach, Momma&quot;) as close friends.

In 1994, the characters from &quot;The Family Circus&quot; made a &quot;guest appearance&quot; in Bill Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot; comic strip. Griffith said, &quot;I remembered Bil&#x27;s affection for Zippy, so I decided to bite the bullet and call him to ask if, instead of me parodying his strip, he&#x27;d agree to jam with me...&quot; Keane drew his characters in Griffith&#x27;s strip, with dialogue written for them by Griffith. Then, on March 7, 1995, Zippy made an appearance, drawn by Griffith, in a &quot;Family Circus&quot; panel. Griffith said that &quot;Family Circus&quot; was &quot;the last remaining folk art strip&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s supposed to be the epitome of squareness, but it turns the corner into a hip zone.&quot;

<text>Attachmate Corporation is a 1982-founded software company which focused on secure terminal emulation, legacy integration, and managed file transfer software. Citrix-compatibility and Attachment &quot;Reflection&quot; were enhanced/added offerings.

==History and products==
===Attachmate Corporation===

Attachmate was founded in 1982 by Frank W. Pritt. It focused initially on the IBM terminal emulation market, and became a major technology employer in the Seattle area.

===KeaTerm===
KEAsystems&#x27; KEAterm products were PC software packages that emulated some of Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VT terminals, and facilitated integrating Windows-based PCs with multiple host applications. These included KEAterm VT340 and VT420 terminal emulators, and KEA X X terminal software).

KEA was acquired by Attachmate.

===DCA IRMA===

Another acquisition was Digital Communications Associates (DCA), makers of IRMA line of terminal emulators, INFOconnect, Crosstalk communications software, and OpenMind collaborative software). DCA was also known for its 3270 IRMA hardware product (used for SDLC), and ISCA SDLC hardware adapters. They also supported driver downloads.

===Extra!===
The Attachmate Extra! family of terminal emulator packages was built to include 3270, 5250 and VT100.

== Acquisition ==
After buying both WRQ, Inc. and Attachmate, who had been long-time competitors in the host emulation business, a group of private equity firms announced in 2005 that the companies would be merged under the new ownership. It was announced that Attachmate founder and CEO Frank Pritt would retire at the same time.

IBM, RedHat, Microsoft, Attachmate, Apache, Cisco, NEC, SAP, Software AG, Adobe Systems, Fujitsu, Oracle, CA Technologies and BonitaSoft, are some of the key players operating in the Global Application Server Market.

<doc id="882960" wikidata="Q2994783" url="?curid=882960" title="Bye Plot">
<text>The Bye Plot of 1603 was a conspiracy, by Roman Catholic priests and Puritans aiming at tolerance for their respective denominations, to kidnap the new English king, James I of England. It is referred to as the &quot;bye&quot; plot, because at the time it was presented as a minor component of a larger plot (the so-called &quot;Main&quot; Plot).

==Background==
The Anglo-Spanish War had been continuing for nearly two decades, with fighting at sea, in the Netherlands and in Ireland. Elizabeth I of England died at the end of March 1603, and James VI of Scotland claimed the English throne, without 
overt opposition. 
In England and Wales, a substantial number of Catholics were subject to fines if they did not attend Church of England services, under a system of Penal Laws. English Catholics protested loyalty to the Crown, and wished the legal constraints on their worship relaxed. They were ministered to by priests, both of the Society of Jesus and other religious orders active in England as a mission, and seminary priests and others not in religious orders (secular priests). The legal position of these priests was unclear.

==Divisions among English Catholics==
A divisive quarrel and pamphlet war among English Catholics, the Archpriest controversy, had in 1603 been contentious for about five years. The resulting alignment of Catholic priests had a great deal to do with making the plots of 1603 impractical, and also made one side of the argument receptive to the idea of informing the London government.

William Watson took the &quot;appellant&quot; side in the Archpriest Controversy, hostile to George Blackwell who had been appointed by the Holy See. Useful to the English government and church for his polemics, Watson was under the protection of Richard Bancroft, then bishop of London. In September 1601, Watson was resident at Fulham Palace. In 1602 he was confined in The Clink, but kept in close touch with Bancroft.

The plot was initially exposed by the archpriest Blackwell and two Jesuits, John Gerard and Henry Garnet, who were on the other side of the dispute. These three (by independent routes) passed on information they had relating to the conspiracy. They had other reasons besides the ongoing controversy: they feared retribution against Catholics if the plan failed; and entertained suspicions regarding the political motivations of the secular priests.

==The plotters==
The plot is known also as Watson&#x27;s Plot, the Catholic Plot, the Surprising Treason, or the Treason of the Priests. Those involved were not in fact exclusively Catholic priests: Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton was a Puritan layman who became drawn in, though the plot never went farther than far-fetched discussion. Another lay conspirator was Sir Griffin Markham.

While they may have had in common a wish for religious toleration, their motivations were varied. Watson wished to have no more fines for recusancy levied. Another plank in the platform of the Bye Plot was the removal of certain ministers of the king. To the extent that these matters can be clarified, the Main Plot that had been laid in parallel wished also for regime change, with James replaced on the throne by Arbella Stuart.

==Events of 1603==
King James moved south at a leisurely pace, having reached Theobalds House in Hertfordshire on 3 May. The scheme, such as it was, depended on Markham&#x27;s view in May that there was a &quot;Scottish precedent&quot; for seizing the person of the king for political advantage. It was in late May or early June (on Gerard&#x27;s own account) that someone (probably Markham) tried to recruit the Jesuit John Gerard. Gerard&#x27;s reaction was negative, and he wrote to Henry Garnet and George Blackwell asking them to put a spoke in the wheels of the plot.

===June===
The date set by Watson for the plot to be carried out was 24 June. This was St John Baptist&#x27;s Day, and a collar day; in the planning of the plot its significance was that courtiers would be at court and regaled ceremonially.

As the date and midsummer approached, Gerard had contacted a Scottish courtier asking that he make the king aware, while also Blackwell, the official head of the English Catholic secular clergy operating from hiding, took roundabout steps. Blackwell&#x27;s communication outran Gerard&#x27;s.

Blackwell revealed something of the plot to the government through an intermediary, the recusant John Gage, who had married Margaret, the daughter of Sir Thomas Copley. When Gage wrote to Sir Robert Cecil, on 28 June, Cecil was already aware of plotting. The Catholic returned exile and conspirator Anthony Copley had also written to Blackwell about the Bye Plot; he was Sir Thomas Copley&#x27;s son and therefore Gage&#x27;s brother-in-law. Blackwell had written to Gage; Cecil assumed there was something more behind these exchanges, so that he asked Gage to produce Blackwell before the Council. It has been suggested that Copley consciously played the double agent.

In the event, Lord Grey withdrew ahead of the day, and the plotters scattered.

===July===
A significant arrest was of Sir George Brooke who was in the Tower of London in July. Markham and Brooke wanted to supplant current members of the Privy Council. Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham was his brother, and a conspirator in the more serious &quot;Main Plot&quot;. Sir George was arraigned on 15 July, and in his eagerness to clear himself, made confessions that clarified to the investigators that two separate groups of plotters had been active. On 16 July a proclamation was issued for Watson&#x27;s arrest. Bancroft at around this time had good reason to distance himself from Watson, and claimed he had not seen him since before the queen died.

King James&#x27;s coronation went ahead on 25 July, his name day (for James the Greater), as planned. His ceremonial entry into London, however, was postponed until March 1604, for reasons including the plague; at this time Westminster did not form part of London.

===August===
Watson was arrested around 5 August in a field by the River Wye near Hay-on-Wye, on the border of England and Wales. He made a confession about the plot, dated 10 August. William Clark, another priest who had been an active organiser, was arrested in Worcester on 13 August.

===November===
Further details of the Bye Plot were revealed by the Catholic priest Francis Barnaby, in prison. He was another appellant contact of Bancroft, who communicated for him with Christopher Bagshaw, and had worked with the plotter William Clark against English Jesuits.

The Court had moved to Wilton House, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. There it was decided that trials could conveniently be held at the bishop&#x27;s palace in Winchester, not very far away. These trials took place 15–18 November. John Lingard in his &quot;History of England&quot; attributed the delay to the continued presence in the country of Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg; Arenburg was there to represent the Spanish Netherlands at James&#x27;s coronation, and the alleged contacts of the Main Plot with him were potentially embarrassing.

On the 15th the two Catholic priests involved, Sir George Brooke and Sir Griffin Markham, and others, were tried. On the 17th Sir Walter Raleigh was tried, and the prosecution managed to make a case that he had been involved in the Bye Plot. Lord Grey as a baron was tried and found guilty by 31 peers, on 18 November, with Lord Cobham who was implicated in the Main Plot.

Guilty verdicts on the conspirators were reached; the only acquittal on a high treason charge among the Bye Plot defendants was Sir Edward Parham. Sir Edward Coke&#x27;s prosecution case for Raleigh&#x27;s involvement in the Bye Plot was tenuous and rhetorical, heavy on personal abuse, but Raleigh&#x27;s role on the periphery of the Main Plot left him with much to explain.

The two priests, Watson and Clark, were executed for their parts in the scheme, on 29 November.

===December===
The lay conspirator George Brooke was executed on 5 December. On 10 December Lord Grey with Markham was taken to the scaffold, pardoned, and spent the rest of his life in the Tower of London; Dudley Carleton who witnessed the proceedings, involving also Lord Cobham, took it to be a well-scripted drama of the king&#x27;s mercy. In particular, Carleton concluded, it was staged for the benefit of Raleigh, who had been caught up in the Bye Plot charges.

==Aftermath==
By an edict of 22 February 1604, King James ordered all Roman Catholic clergy (&quot;Jesuits, Seminaries and other Priests&quot;) to leave his kingdom by 19 March. This edict had been drafted in July 1603 on the discovery of the plots.

Anthony Copley was condemned to death; but he was pardoned on 18 August 1604, having made a full confession on the history of the plot.

<doc id="882971" wikidata="Q3246874" url="?curid=882971" title="Kordell Stewart">
<text>Kordell Stewart (born October 16, 1972) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons, primarily with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Nicknamed &quot;Slash&quot;, he played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes and achieved recognition as a senior for the &quot;Miracle at Michigan&quot;, a Hail Mary pass he completed to defeat the Michigan Wolverines. He was selected by the Steelers in the second round of the 1995 NFL draft.

Stewart held a variety of roles for the Steelers before becoming their starting quarterback in 1997, which saw him help guide the team to an AFC Championship Game appearance. His most successful season was in 2001 where he led Pittsburgh to the conference&#x27;s top seed and a return to the conference championship, while earning Pro Bowl and AFC Offensive Player of the Year honors. Stewart&#x27;s performance declined the following year, resulting in him being released by the Steelers. Afterwards, Stewart played one season for the Chicago Bears and held a backup role during two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens. He ranks sixth in quarterback rushing touchdowns at 38.

==Early life==
Kordell Stewart was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended John Ehret High School in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

==College career==
In 1991, Stewart received a scholarship to the University of Colorado. Playing under coach Bill McCartney, he became one of the most prolific quarterbacks in school history, setting several Buffaloes records, including most passes completed, most passing yards, and most touchdown passes.

Stewart led the option-oriented Buffaloes to a pair of top-10 regular-season finishes in the AP and Coaches polls in 1992 and 1994 as well as wins in the 1993 Aloha Bowl and 1995 Fiesta Bowl. He was selected as a second-team All-American his senior year as nationally ranked No. 3 Colorado finished 11–1 in 1994.

One of his greatest moments for the Colorado Buffaloes occurred in the beginning of his college career. On September 5, 1992, Stewart started his first game as a sophomore as Colorado unveiled a pass-oriented offense that lifted the 12th-ranked Buffaloes past in-state rival Colorado State, 37–17. Stewart connected on 21 of 36 passes for a then school-record 409 yards and four touchdowns in the contest.

On September 24, 1994, Stewart threw the game-winning, 64-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass into the end zone to wide receiver Michael Westbrook in the closing seconds to beat the Michigan Wolverines.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
====1995–1996====
Stewart was used sparingly for select plays. In his first season, he had 15 carries with 14 receptions (for a total of two touchdowns) while making a handshake deal with Bill Cowher to be given a chance for the quarterback position, as Neil O&#x27;Donnell was the incumbent and also slated to be a free agent after the 1995 season was over. After a few games of brief rushes and catches, he got his first pass attempt against the Cleveland Browns. The attempt resulted in a touchdown. In total, he threw seven passes that year.

In the 1996 playoffs, he was used for a couple of carries (nine combined) in Pittsburgh&#x27;s run to Super Bowl XXX. Against Buffalo, he was used for a punt, which he kicked 41 yards to the endzone for a touchback. In the AFC Championship against the Indianapolis Colts, he caught two passes for 18 yards and a touchdown that gave Pittsburgh a 10–6 lead at halftime in an eventual win. He ran four times for 15 yards in the Super Bowl loss to the Dallas Cowboys, which proved to be his only trip to the big game. He is the only rookie in NFL history to take a snap at the quarterback position in a Super Bowl; in which he converted a 4th &amp; 1 on a quarterback sneak.
In 1996, Pittsburgh elected to use third-year backup Jim Miller as their week one starter. When he fizzled out in the middle of the game, they went with Mike Tomczak (who had been with Pittsburgh since 1993), with the Steelers being bolstered by their off-season trade acquisition of Jerome Bettis. Stewart played sparingly at quarterback (30 passes) while being more used for catches and runs. He rushed 39 times (his longest play being an 80-yard touchdown run versus Carolina) and caught 17 passes for a combined total of eight touchdowns. In the 1997 playoffs, he ran nine times for 48 yards against the Colts for two touchdowns.

====1997====
Stewart was named the starting quarterback for the 1997 season. In his first season as a starting quarterback in the NFL, he led the Steelers to an 11–5 record. He was the first quarterback to throw for twenty touchdowns and run for ten in history. The Steelers went to the AFC Championship Game, which they lost to the Denver Broncos. Stewart threw three interceptions (two of which were made in the opposing Denver end zone), and lost a fumble accounting for all four Steeler turnovers in a 24–21 loss.

====1998–1999====
Prior to the 1998 season, the Steelers lost their offensive coordinator, Chan Gailey as he was signed as the Cowboys head coach. To replace him, the Steelers brought in Ray Sherman from the Vikings. In addition, Stewart&#x27;s leading receiver and Pro Bowler Yancey Thigpen also left via free agency after the 1997 season. By mid-season in 1998, the Steelers had lost three of the five starting offensive linemen from the 1997 AFC Championship game and, as a result, Stewart and the Steelers offense struggled and failed to make the playoffs in both seasons.

====2000====
Coach Bill Cowher named Kent Graham quarterback to start the season, and the team got off to a 1–3 start. When Graham injured his hip, Stewart was tapped to replace him. The team finished 9–7 and missed the playoffs by one game.

====2001====
As starting quarterback, Stewart led the 2001 Steelers to a 13–3 regular-season record and the top seed in the AFC playoffs. Under the tutelage of new QB coach Tom Clements and new offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey, Stewart had his best year as a pro, throwing for over 3,000 yards, completing 60 percent of his passes, and attaining a passer rating of 81.7. He threw for 14 TDs and ran for five more. Stewart was elected to the Pro Bowl and was named the Steelers MVP.

The Steelers easily defeated the then-defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens in the divisional playoffs. The eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots defeated the Steelers in the AFC Championship Game.

====2002====
Stewart began the 2002 season as the Steelers&#x27; starting quarterback, but after throwing an interception into double coverage in the end zone at home against the Cleveland Browns in the third game of the season, he was replaced by increasingly popular backup Tommy Maddox, and Stewart was released at the end of the season. Stewart did start two games in place of an injured Maddox to keep the team&#x27;s playoff hopes alive. Maddox returned, and Stewart never played in Pittsburgh again.

===Chicago Bears===
The following season, Stewart signed as a free agent with the Chicago Bears and was named the starter. After several poor performances in 2003, he was replaced in favor of Chris Chandler. After getting the same results from Chandler, he was reinserted as the starter, before getting benched in favor of rookie Rex Grossman after the Bears were eliminated from the playoffs. Stewart was released at the end of the season.

===Baltimore Ravens===
Stewart was signed in 2004 by the Ravens to play a backup role to Kyle Boller, and later served as a replacement for the injured Anthony Wright. He did not, however, throw a pass that season. He was unexpectedly successful as an emergency replacement for punter Dave Zastudil, being named NFL Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance. He was released following the 2004 season, but due to an injury to starting quarterback Kyle Boller during Week #1 of the 2005 season, the Ravens once again signed Stewart to be a backup to Anthony Wright.

==Nickname==
Pittsburgh Steelers color commentator Myron Cope gave Stewart the nickname &quot;Slash&quot;. He chose this name under the presumption that Stewart could play multiple positions—quarterback/receiver/rusher (quarterback &quot;slash&quot; receiver &quot;slash&quot; rusher).

After confining him to many utility roles during the 1995 season, when the Steelers made it to Super Bowl XXX only to lose to the Dallas Cowboys, the team gave Stewart the opportunity to compete for the starting quarterback position in 1996. Following a preseason battle, Bill Cowher named Jim Miller as the Steelers&#x27; starting quarterback and kept Stewart in his &quot;Slash&quot; role. Miller struggled at Jacksonville on opening day and was replaced by Mike Tomczak for the rest of the season. In a December 1996 game against the Carolina Panthers, Stewart set a then-NFL record for longest touchdown run by a quarterback with an 80-yard rush.

==NFL career statistics==
==Post-NFL career==
Following Boller&#x27;s reactivation on November 9, 2005, the Ravens cut Stewart instead of keeping him as a third-string player, activating running back Musa Smith instead. Stewart had no comment following the announcement he had been cut from the team.

Stewart made guest appearances on the TV shows &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; and &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;.

On April 29, 2008, in an interview on the WCNN &quot;680 The Fan&quot;, Stewart expressed interest in returning to the NFL. Also, according to ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;First Take&quot; on July 28, 2008, Stewart had not officially retired and had been working out at his home, to attempt a comeback following pre-season. He later was put into free agency but was never selected by a team.

He appeared in January 2009 as an analyst on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College Football Live&quot;, and then later appeared again in July during the show&#x27;s &quot;50 States Tour&quot; for the show&#x27;s episode regarding Colorado athletics.

Stewart was also a sideline reporter for the United Football League and is currently an analyst on various ESPN shows such as &quot;NFL Live&quot;, &quot;NFL 32&quot;, &quot;Take 2&quot;, and &quot;Mike and Mike in the Morning&quot;.

Stewart officially retired from the NFL in 2012.

==Personal life==
Stewart has a son, Syre, with his ex-girlfriend Tania Richardson.
Stewart met Porsha Williams in 2009 at downtown Atlanta&#x27;s Luckie Lounge. On May 21, 2011, they married in a lavish ceremony that was featured on WE tv&#x27;s &quot;Platinum Weddings&quot;. Stewart appeared as himself alongside Williams on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot; season 5 and 6. Stewart filed for divorce from Williams on March 22, 2013, on the grounds that the marriage was irretrievably broken. Initial reports stated he was unwilling to pay any spousal support.

In March 2017, Kordell won a $3 million lawsuit against internet personality Andrew Chad Caldwell, who made headlines in 2014 in front of a St. Louis church stating that he was delivered from homosexuality. Andrew Caldwell claimed to have a gay relationship with Kordell. Since the lawsuit, Kordell has still not been paid by Andrew Caldwell. In 2021 on an episode of Tamron Hall, Kordell referenced the incident, which led to Andrew Caldwell going to social media threatening to file a lawsuit against both Tamron Hall and Kordell for mentioning the issue that Andrew Caldwell denies despite evidence that proved he made up the false accusations.

Stewart is an avid golfer and carried a nine handicap when he was an active NFL player.

Stewart was the cover athlete for the 1997 video game NFL Blitz.

On March 23, 1998, Stewart appeared on the first-ever cover of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; alongside Kobe Bryant, Alex Rodriguez and Eric Lindros.

Stewart later published an essay on &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot;, detailing the racism and false rumors of homosexuality he faced as the Steelers&#x27; quarterback.

<text>Chambéry (, , ; Arpitan: &quot;Chambèri&quot;) is the prefecture and largest city of the Savoie department in the southeastern Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France.

The population of the commune of Chambéry was 60,251 as of 2022, while the population of the Chambéry metropolitan area was 263,919. The city is located at the foot of the French Alps between Bauges and Chartreuse mountains, and is a railway and highway crossroads.

It has been the historical capital of the Savoy region since the 13th century, when Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, made the city his seat of power. The annexation of Savoy merged the city to France in 1860. Together with other alpine towns Chambéry engages in the Alpine Town of the Year Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Chambéry was awarded Alpine Town of the Year 2006.

==Geography==
Chambéry was founded at a crossroads of ancient routes through the Dauphiné (&quot;Dôfenâ&quot;) region of France, Switzerland, and Italy, in a wide valley between the Bauges and the Chartreuse Mountains on the Leysse River. The metropolitan area has more than 125,000 residents, extending from the vineyard slopes of the :fr:Combe de Savoie almost to the shores of the Lac du Bourget, the largest natural lake in France. The city is a major railway hub at the midpoint of the Franco-Italian Turin–Lyon high-speed railway (TGV).

Chambéry is situated in southeast France, from Paris, from Marseille, from Turin, from Lyon and from Geneva. It is found in a large valley, surrounded by the Massif des Bauges to the east (dominated by Le Nivolet, upon which La Croix du Nivolet is found), Mont Granier (Chartreuse) and the Chaîne de Belledonne to the south, the Chaîne de l&#x27;Épine (the most southern mountain of the Jura) to the west and the Lac du Bourget to the north. If seen as the meeting point of the Jura and the Alps, it is the westernmost point of the Swiss plateau which lies between them.

The towns surrounding Chambéry are Barberaz, Bassens, Cognin, Jacob-Bellecombette, La Motte-Servolex, La Ravoire, Saint-Alban-Leysse and Sonnaz.

==History==

The history of Chambéry is closely linked to the House of Savoy and was the Savoyard capital from 1295 to 1563. During this time, Savoy encompassed a region that stretched from Bourg-en-Bresse in the west, across the Alps to Turin, north to Geneva, and south to Nice. Chambéry declined after Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy moved his capital to Turin in 1563.

France annexed the regions that formerly constituted the Duchy of Savoy west of the Alps in 1792; however, the former duchy and Chambéry were returned to the rulers of the House of Savoy in Turin in 1815 following the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. The need for urban revitalization was met by the establishment of the &quot;Société Académique de Savoie&quot; in 1820, which was devoted to material and ethical progress, now housed in an apartment of the ducal château. Chambéry and lands of the former duchy, as well as the County of Nice, were ceded to France by Piedmont in 1860, under the reign of Napoleon III. The Hôtel de Ville was officially opened in 1867.

==Climate==
Chambéry is right on the boundary between the humid subtropical (Cfa) and oceanic climates (Cfb) under the Köppen system. In spite of this it is highly influenced by its interior position within France, resulting in quite hot summers and winters with frequent temperatures below freezing, especially at night. Convective rainfall is frequent for much of the year, rendering high precipitation/day quotas.

==Main sights==
===Château de Chambéry===

The first counts of Savoy settled into an existing fortress in 1285 and expanded it in the early-14th century to serve as a residence, seat of power and administration, and as stronghold for the House of Savoy. However, it quickly became obsolete as a serious fortification genuinely capable of resisting a siege. Due to constant French hostilities, Duke Emmanuel Philibert decided to move his capital to Turin.

The château remained purely an administrative centre until Christine Marie of France, Duchess of Savoy, returned to hold court in 1640. It was the site of the 1684 marriage between Victor Amadeus II and Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans, niece of Louis XIV. Victor Amadeus II, having abdicated, lived here with his second wife Anna Canalis di Cumiana before they were imprisoned at the Castle of Rivoli for trying to reclaim the throne.

In 1786, Victor Amadeus III enlarged it, adding a Royal Wing.

Under Napoleon Bonaparte, the &quot;Aile du Midi&quot; (&quot;South Wing&quot;) was rebuilt and redecorated to house the imperial prefecture of the department of Mont-Blanc. Elaborate modification to the structure were made again after Savoy was annexed by France in 1860.

Today, the political administration of the department of Savoie is located in the castle, and it is open for tours and concerts.

===Fontaine des Éléphants===
The &quot;Fontaine des Éléphants&quot; (&quot;Elephants Fountain&quot;) is the most famous landmark in Chambéry. It was built in 1838 to honour Benoît de Boigne&#x27;s feats when he was in India. The monumental fountain has realistic sculptures of the head and forelimbs of four lifesize elephants truncated into the base of a tall column in the shape of the savoyan (&quot;savoyarde&quot;) cross, topped by a statue of de Boigne. At first, the landmark was mocked by the local residents who were annoyed by it, but it now is accepted as one of the city&#x27;s symbols.

Since the early controversy, the statue kept its nickname of &quot;les quatre sans culs&quot;, (&quot;the four without arses&quot;, which sounds in French similar to the title of the best-known movie by &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; director François Truffaut: &quot;Les quatre cents coups&quot;, &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;). A total restoration was done between December 2014 and July 2015.

===Others===

The Cistercian Abbey of Hautecombe, founded in 1135, is one of the burial places of the rulers of the House of Savoy. Saint Francis de Sales officiated at Notre-Dame de Myans (established before the 12th century). Francis I of France went to Notre-Dame de l&#x27;Aumône at Rumilly in the 13th century as a pilgrim. The Sisters of St Joseph, an order founded at Chambéry in 1812, devotes itself to teaching and charitable work, and today, its members are now spread worldwide.

Chambéry is also the administrative headquarters of the Orchestre des Pays de Savoie.

==Education==
The Savoy Mont Blanc University (a.k.a. Chambéry University) is a university founded in 1979 with one campus in Annecy and two around Chambéry. It has about 15,000 students.

Chambéry has a campus of the Arts et Métiers ParisTech (ENSAM) engineering graduate school, which created a research institute in 1994 there. It offers doctoral and master programs in the field of mechanical and industrial engineering.

Chambéry is also home to the INSEEC Business School, a French business school which offers Master in Management – Grande école program educational system.

==Transport==

Chambéry Airport serves Chambéry in the winter. The Chambéry-Challes-les-Eaux station provides rail connections.

From 1892 to 1932, the Chambéry tramway, a narrow-gauge steam tram network, connected the town with its surroundings.

==Military==

Chambéry is home to the 13th Battalion of the &quot;Chasseurs Alpins&quot;.

==Demographics==
In 2022, 60,251 people lived in the city, while its metropolitan area had a population of 263,919.

<text>South Bank railway station is located on the Gold Coast line in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is one of two stations serving the South Brisbane area, the other being South Brisbane station. It was formerly known as Vulture Street station due to being located on Vulture Street.

==History==
South Bank station opened as Vulture Street, after the adjoining street. The station provides access to the park and cinemas, and the Grey Street retail and dining precinct.

In September 1930, the standard gauge New South Wales North Coast line opened to the west of the station. In 1995, as part of the construction of the Gold Coast line, the standard gauge line was converted to dual gauge.

On 27 April 2001, the station was renamed South Bank (Vulture Street), later being simplified to South Bank in reference to its proximity to the South Bank Parklands. At the same time a platform face was added on the dual gauge line.

In December 2013, work commenced on a transit oriented development at South Bank, which will see the station covered with office and apartment buildings. The new apartments are called Southpoint. The proposal was announced by the Queensland Government in November 2007.

==Services==
South Bank station is served by Beenleigh, Cleveland and Gold Coast line services.

==Services by platform==
==Transport links==
Adjacent to the station lies the South Bank busway station that is served by Transport for Brisbane bus services.

<doc id="882997" wikidata="Q1033489" url="?curid=882997" title="Compaq Portable series">
<text>Compaq&#x27;s first computers&#x27; form factors were portable, also called &quot;luggables&quot;, and then &quot;lunchbox computers&quot;, and together constituted the Compaq Portable series. These computers measured approximately deep, tall, and approximately wide. As the products evolved, laptops and notebooks were created offering a new level of portability that caused the market to explode.

Some of the portables, the Portable and Portable II, had CRT monitors, while later the Portable III and the Portable 386) had flat, monochrome, usually amber, plasma displays. The portables came/could come with internal hard disk drives on 0.5&quot; shock mount springs; diskette drives, usually 5-&quot; double- or quadruple-density drives; batteries; and/or a dual-ISA expansion chassis, about one full-drive-height wide. Note this was before the term &quot;ISA&quot; became a standard. The Compaq Portable 486 included mono and color LCD screens and were battery powered.

==Machines of the series==
* Compaq Portable – Compaq&#x27;s first computer; first 100% IBM PC compatible
** Compaq Portable Plus – Compaq&#x27;s version with built-in hard drive
** Compaq Portable 286 – Compaq&#x27;s version of the PC AT in the original Compaq Portable chassis; equipped with 6/8-MHz 286 and a high-speed 20-MB hard drive
* Compaq Portable II – smaller and lighter version of Compaq Portable 286; it was less expensive but with limited upgradability and a slower hard drive
* Compaq Portable III
** Compaq Portable 386
* Compaq Portable 486 and Compaq Portable 486c

The Compaq Portable is an early portable computer which was one of the first 100% IBM PC compatible systems. It was Compaq Computer Corporation&#x27;s first product, to be followed by others in the Compaq Portable series and later Compaq Deskpro series.

== Initial Production and Competition==
The Compaq Portable was announced in November 1982 and first shipped in March 1983, priced at with a single half-height 5¼&quot; diskette drive or for dual, full-height diskette drives. The Compaq Portable folded up into a luggable case the size of a portable sewing machine. Compaq sold 53,000 units in the first year with a total of in revenue, an American Business record. In the second year revenue hit setting an industry record. Third year revenue was at , another US business record.

The computer was an early all-in-one, becoming available two years after the CP/M-based Osborne 1 and Kaypro II, in the same year as the 8088 and MS-DOS-based (but not entirely IBM PC compatible) Dynalogic Hyperion, and a year before the Commodore SX-64. Its design was influenced by that of the Xerox NoteTaker, a prototype computer developed at Xerox PARC in 1976. Other portable &quot;work-alikes&quot;, that were not PC compatible clones include the Seequa Chameleon, and Corona Data Systems&#x27; Model PPC-400, and Eagle Computer&#x27;s Eagle Spirit Portable. They were all short-lived competitors.

IBM responded to the Compaq Portable with the IBM Portable, developed because its sales force needed a comparable computer to sell against Compaq.

The Compaq Portable has basically the same off-the-self hardware as an IBM PC, transplanted into a luggable case (specifically designed to fit as carry-on luggage on an airplane), with Compaq&#x27;s BIOS instead of IBM&#x27;s. All Portables shipped with 128k of RAM and 1-2 double-sided double-density 360 KB disk drives.

The machine uses a unique hybrid of the IBM MDA and CGA which supports the latter&#x27;s graphics modes, but contains both cards&#x27; text fonts in ROM. When using the internal monochrome monitor the 9x14 font is used, and the 8x8 one when an external monitor is used (the user switches between internal and external monitors by pressing ). The user can use both IBM video standards, for graphics capabilities and high-resolution text. With a larger external monitor, the graphics hardware is also used in the original Compaq Deskpro desktop computer.

Compaq used a “foam and foil” keyboard from Keytronics, with contact mylar pads that were also featured in the Tandy TRS-80, Apple Lisa 1 and 2, Compaq Deskpro 286 AT, some mainframe terminals, SUN Type 4, and some Wang keyboards. The foam pads the keyboards used to make contact with the circuit board when pressed disintegrate over time, due to both the wear of normal use and natural wear. The CRT display also suffered from a low refresh rate and heavy ghosting.

== Software ==
Compaq&#x27;s efforts were possible because IBM had used mostly off-the-shelf parts for the PC and published full technical documentation for it, and because Microsoft had kept the right to license MS-DOS to other computer manufacturers. The main difficulty was the BIOS, because it contained IBM&#x27;s copyrighted code. Compaq solved this problem by producing a clean room workalike that performed all documented functions of the IBM PC BIOS, but was completely written from scratch.

Although numerous other companies soon also began selling PC compatibles, few matched Compaq&#x27;s achievement of essentially-complete software compatibility with the IBM PC (typically reaching &quot;95% compatibility&quot; at best).Then Phoenix Technologies and others began selling similarly reverse-engineered BIOSs on the open market.

The first Portables used MS-DOS essentially identical to PC DOS 1.10 except for having a standalone BASIC that did not require the IBM PC&#x27;s ROM Cassette BASIC, but this was superseded in a few months by MS-DOS 2.00 which added hard disk support and other advanced features. The initial Portables are similar to the 16K-64K models of the IBM PC in that the BIOS was limited to 544K of RAM and did not support expansion ROMs, thus making them unable to use EGA/VGA cards, hard disks, or similar hardware. After DOS 2.x and the IBM XT came out, Compaq upgraded the BIOS. Although the Portable was not offered with a factory hard disk, users commonly installed them. Starting in 1984, Compaq began offering a hard-disk equipped version in the Portable Plus. The original hard disks offered would be 10 or 21 megabytes, although bad sectors often reduced the space available for use.

== Reception ==
&quot;BYTE&quot; wrote, after testing a prototype, that the Compaq Portable &quot;looks like a sure winner&quot; because of its portability, cost, and high degree of compatibility with the IBM PC. Its reviewer tested IBM PC DOS, CP/M-86, WordStar, SuperCalc, and several other software packages, and found that all worked except one game. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; also rated the Compaq Portable very highly for compatibility, reporting that all tested applications ran. It praised the &quot;rugged&quot; hardware design and sharp display, and concluded that it was &quot;certainly worth consideration by anyone seeking to run IBM PC software without an IBM PC&quot;.

== Later Models ==
The Compaq Portable Plus simply had a hard drive to replace one floppy disk drive, and logos and badges with gold backgrounds instead of silver. Independent computer stores were previously doing this upon request of users, and Compaq saw this as a lost revenue opportunity. In 1985, Compaq introduced the Portable 286, although it was replaced by the more compact Portable II in a redesigned case within a few months. The Portable 286 featured a full height hard disk, and the options of one half-height floppy drive, two half-height floppy drives, or a half-height floppy drive and a tape backup drive The Compaq Portable 286, Compaq&#x27;s version of the PC AT was offered in the original Compaq Portable chassis; equipped with 286 and a high-speed hard drive
The Compaq Portable II – was smaller and lighter version of Compaq Portable 286; it was less expensive but with limited upgradability and a slower hard drive.

The Compaq Portable III was another AT-compatible computer released in 1987. It was advertised as being much smaller and lighter than the previous portable x86-PCs, however it was still quite large by today&#x27;s standards. Three models were announced at release. The Model 1 had a list price of and was equipped with a Intel 80286, RAM, floppy, and a amber colored gas-plasma display. Other options included the Model 20 at which added a hard disk, or for the Model 40 with the upgraded hard disk. There was also an optional ISA Expansion chassis allowed for 2 full length 16-bit ISA add-in cards for . Power is supplied using a mains electricity outlet, no battery exists.

The Compaq Portable III, Compaq Portable 386, Compaq Portable 486 and Compaq Portable 486c were later in the series.

<doc id="883010" wikidata="Q3519423" url="?curid=883010" title="Thai Town, Los Angeles">
<text>Thai Town () is a neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California. In 2008, it was one of the five Asian Pacific Islander neighborhoods in the city—along with Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Historic Filipinotown, and Koreatown—that received federal recognition as a Preserve America neighborhood. It is the only officially recognized &quot;Thai Town&quot; in the United States.

==History==
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously on October 27, 1999, to designate the neighborhood as &quot;Thai Town,&quot; the first place in the United States with that name. The designation was proposed by Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who said the move would bring neighborhood pride, economic development and promotion of tourism to the area. At that time, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) was instructed to install signage to identify Thai Town.

It was significant to Goldberg that the staff of the Thai Community Development Center includes other Asians, Latinos and whites, all intent on improving the East Hollywood business community in general. &quot;They&#x27;re already calling Thai Town the 77th province,&quot; said Thai Chamber of Commerce President Niphun Rojanasopondist, referring to the 76 provinces that made up Thailand at the time.

In 2000, the center won a $15,000 Department of Public Works matching grant to create a garden and to bring from Thailand four golden statues of kinnari (mythical creatures who are half angel, half bird) to mark Thai Town&#x27;s borders.

In 2008, the Thai Community Development Center expanded its partnership with the four Asian Pacific Islander communities in Los Angeles to pursue a national designation by the White House of all five API towns as a Preserve America Neighborhood. The other communities are Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Historic Filipinotown and Koreatown. They formed the API Preserve America Neighborhood Coalition. First Lady Laura Bush presented the &quot;Preserve America&quot; designation, signifying value as a cultural and historic asset. The designation made Thai Town eligible for up to $250,000 in Preserve America grants, along with $250,000 in other public and private matching funds.

==Geography==
Thai Town is a six-block neighborhood flanking Hollywood Boulevard between Normandie Avenue and Western Avenue, its entrances being marked by two statues of &quot;apsonsi&quot; (a mythical half human, half lion angel in Thai folklore).

Thai Town is bordered by the neighborhoods of Los Feliz to the north and east, central Hollywood to the west, and Little Armenia to the south.

==Neighborhood==

In 2000 a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer said Thai Town was a place where

gourmands can stock up on bitter melon and round Thai eggplant. A Thai dessert shop offers preserved jackfruit, Pandan cookies and Kring Krang, crisply sweetened rice. The large Silom supermarket occupies the middle of a block near Hobart Boulevard, its exterior the rose-hued color of dusk with ornate trimming and a spirit house, draped with colorful garlands and a stone-faced Buddha image, guarding the entrance from destructive forces.

==Demographics==
The neighborhood has been the home to immigrant groups, including Armenians and Latinos, for a long time, and Thai Americans began settling there in the 1960s. 

The influx of Thai people into East Hollywood made the neighborhood a &quot;point of entry&quot; for the 80,000 Thais estimated to be living in Southern California. Many came with the intention to attend Southern California universities. 

Data for the area show that 27% of households live below the poverty line—a rate 12 percentage points higher than the county average. Fueling the persistent poverty has been the arrival of thousands of working-class Thai immigrants in the last two decades who have flooded sweatshops, restaurant kitchens and, most recently, massage parlors, said Chancee Martorell, executive director of the Thai Community Development Center, which has conducted several studies on the plight of Thai Town.

==Public transport==
The area is served by the Metro B Line subway at the Hollywood/Western station in addition to Metro Local bus lines 2, 180, 206, 207, &amp; 217.

==Holidays==

On the first Sunday in April, Thai Town celebrates Songkran, the Thai New Year, by closing off Hollywood Boulevard within its boundaries, and setting up food stands and entertainment on the street along with a parade on the street from New Hampshire Avenue to Winona Boulevard.

The conference resulted in the 1604 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and, in 1611, the King James Version of the Bible.

==Attendance==
While the meeting was originally scheduled for November 1603, an outbreak of plague meant it was postponed until February. The conference was called in response to a series of requests for reform set down in the Millenary Petition by the Puritans, a document which supposedly contained the signatures of 1000 Puritan ministers, including Henry Robinson, Anthony Watson, Tobias Matthew, Thomas Dove, Anthony Rudd, Thomas Bilson, Gervase Babington, Deans Lancelot Andrewes, John Overall, James Montague, William Barlow, Giles Tomson and Thomas Ravis. Also John Rainolds (sometimes written as Reynolds), the president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. There were three meetings over a period of five days.

==First meeting==
The conference set off with a meeting between James and his bishops about some of the Puritan complaints detailed in the Millenary Petition, particularly the complaints about the Catholic terms Absolution and Confirmation. The King, after ending his talks with the bishops, claimed he was &quot;well satisfied&quot;, and declared that &quot;the manner might be changed and some things cleared&quot;. Private baptism, especially when administered by women, would prove to be a more intense argument between James and his bishops, but James eventually persuaded them that only ministers should administer baptisms.

James then turned his attention to ecclesiastical discipline. Excommunication for &quot;trifles and twelvepenny matters&quot; was to be abolished, and the often hasty trial policies of the commissaries&#x27; court were to be reviewed and amended by the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice. For the Puritan complaint that punishment should be enforced by Christ&#x27;s own institution, James held the view that bishops should not exercise ecclesiastical discipline solely, though he did not speak of any specific method that he would use to remedy this.

All in all, James was pleased, and had good reason to be. With the first meeting, not only had he eloquently reached agreements on many of the Puritan demands, he also avoided any major arguments.

==Aftermath==
Soon after the conference, Archbishop John Whitgift died and the anti-Puritan Richard Bancroft, who had argued against the Puritans at Hampton Court, was appointed to the See of Canterbury, and the King&#x27;s fears led to demands that Puritan ministers adhere to each of the Thirty-Nine Articles.

But the Hampton Court Conference also bore fruit for the Puritans, who, led by Rainolds, insisted that man know God&#x27;s word without intermediaries, as it led to James&#x27;s commissioning of that translation of the Christian Bible into the English vernacular, which would be known as the &quot;Authorised Version&quot; because it alone was authorised to be read in Churches. It is now commonly described as the King James Version. Crucially, the King broadened a base of support, which under his predecessor Elizabeth I had been narrowed through harsh anti-Catholic laws, through his moderate and inclusive approach to the problems of English religion; while alienating the more extreme Puritan and Catholic elements of English Christianity.

<text>Boggo Road / Park Road railway station, formerly Park Road railway station, is the junction station for the Cleveland and Gold Coast lines in Queensland, Australia. It is located in the Brisbane suburb of Dutton Park.

It is served by Beenleigh, Cleveland and Gold Coast line services. Immediately south of the station lies a triangle junction with the Cleveland and Fisherman Islands lines branching off.

==History==

In September 1930, the standard gauge NSW North Coast line opened to the west of the station. On 12 November 1942, a wartime siding opened at Park Road, followed by a second on 28 February 1944. After falling out of use in 1945, the yard was reactivated in 1949. In its later years, it was primarily used by paper trains for Queensland Newspapers. It closed again in the early 1990s.

In February 1995, the waiting shed on the up platform was demolished due to being termite infested.

As part of the construction of the Gold Coast line in the mid-1990s, the standard gauge line was converted to dual gauge to allow these services to be segregated from Beenleigh and Cleveland services. In 2000, a project commenced to add a fourth track and platform face between the existing lines, as well as add a platform face to the dual gauge line. The new platform opened on 12 June 2001.

Platform 4 was intended for use by Gold Coast trains but the curvature of the platform was deemed unsafe for commuter train usage. In preparation for sweeping changes across the network on 20 January 2014, the use of platform 4 at Park Road was trialled from 13 January, before opening for selected Gold Coast services on 20 January.

During a 10-day track closure in December 2021 and January 2022, Park Road station was closed to allow for works to move the Up Beenleigh track 50 metres to the east following the dual gauge unwired flyover, to support the final alignment of Cross River Rail southern portal. The section of track from Dutton Park that allowed access to Platform 2 at Park Road was also removed, resulting in all trains from the down Beenleigh track servicing Platform 3 at Park Road.

As part of the Cross River Rail project, a further two underground platforms are to open in 2026.

In August 2024, the station was renamed from Park Road to Boggo Road / Park Road ahead of an eventual renaming to Boggo Road.

==Services==
Park Road station is served by Beenleigh, Cleveland and Gold Coast line services.

<doc id="883018" wikidata="Q1378223" url="?curid=883018" title="Shannon Sharpe">
<text>Shannon Sharpe (born June 26, 1968) is an American former professional football tight end who played 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Denver Broncos. Regarded as one of the greatest tight ends of all time, he ranks third in tight end receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns. He was also the first NFL tight end to amass over 10,000 receiving yards. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011.

Sharpe played college football for the Savannah State Tigers and was selected by the Broncos in the seventh round of the 1990 NFL draft. During his 12 non-consecutive seasons with Denver, he was selected to seven consecutive Pro Bowls and four first-team All-Pros, and won two consecutive Super Bowl titles. In between his Broncos tenures, Sharpe was a member of Baltimore Ravens for two seasons, with whom he received an eighth Pro Bowl selection and won a third Super Bowl title. Sharpe retired as the NFL leader in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns by a tight end. Following his retirement, Sharpe appeared as an analyst for &quot;The NFL Today&quot; on CBS Sports and co-hosted &quot;Skip and Shannon: Undisputed&quot; on Fox Sports 1 with Skip Bayless from 2016 to 2023.

==Early life and education==
Sharpe, the younger brother of former NFL star wide receiver Sterling Sharpe, grew up in Glennville, Georgia, where he was an all-state player in three sports at Glennville High School. He once joked, &quot;We were so poor, a robber once broke into our house and we ended up robbing the robber.&quot; He commented, &quot;I was a terrible student. I didn&#x27;t graduate magna cum laude, I graduated &#x27;Thank you, Lawdy!&#x27;&quot; At Savannah State University, he played football and basketball, and also competed in track and field. In track, he competed in jumping and throwing events.

Sharpe was a three-time All-Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference selection from 1987 to 1989 and the SIAC Player of the Year in 1987. He was also selected as a Kodak Division II All-American in 1989. He led the Tigers&#x27; football team to their best records in the program&#x27;s history: 7–3 in 1988 and 8–1 in 1989. As a senior, Sharpe caught 61 passes for 1,312 yards and 18 touchdowns, including three games with more than 200 yards. Sharpe finished his college career with 192 receptions for 3,744 yards and 40 touchdowns. He was inducted into the Division II Football Hall of Fame in 2009, Savannah State&#x27;s athletic Hall of Fame in 2010, and the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2013. In addition, Savannah State University also retired Sharpe&#x27;s No. 2 jersey.

==Professional career==
Despite his stellar college career, Sharpe was not considered a highly rated prospect in the 1990 NFL draft. In addition to playing Division II college football, Sharpe&#x27;s size (6&#x27;2&quot;, 230 pounds) was considered too large for a receiver and too small for a tight end. He was eventually selected in the seventh round with the 192nd pick by the Denver Broncos. After two mediocre seasons as a receiver in which he caught just 29 passes, Denver converted him to a tight end. This quickly paid off, as Sharpe caught 53 passes in his third season. He remained with Denver until 1999, winning two championship rings at Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII in the process. After a two-year stint with the Baltimore Ravens, where he won another championship ring at Super Bowl XXXV, he returned to the Broncos. He played there until 2003. From there, he retired to become an NFL analyst for CBS.

Ozzie Newsome, the Ravens&#x27; general manager, said of Sharpe during his career: &quot;I think he&#x27;s a threat when he&#x27;s on the field. He has to be double-teamed. He&#x27;s a great route-runner. He&#x27;s proven that he can make the big plays. That&#x27;s what separates him. He&#x27;s a threat.&quot; Sharpe was selected to the All-Pro Team four times, played in eight Pro Bowls (1992–1998, 2001) and amassed over 1,000 receiving yards in three different seasons. In a 1993 playoff game against the Los Angeles Raiders, Sharpe tied a postseason record with 13 receptions for 156 yards and a touchdown. In the Ravens&#x27; 2000 AFC title game against the Oakland Raiders, he caught a short pass on third down and 18 from his own four-yard line and took it 96 yards for a touchdown, the only touchdown the Ravens scored, en route to a 16–3 Ravens&#x27; win. As of 2025, this remains the Ravens&#x27; longest offensive play in team history. Sharpe also caught a 50+ yard pass in each of their other two playoff games. He finished his 14-year career with 815 receptions for 10,060 yards and 62 touchdowns in 203 games.

Sharpe was among the 17 finalists being considered for enshrinement at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009. However, he was passed over in his first year in a class that included Bruce Smith, Ralph Wilson, Derrick Thomas and Rod Woodson. 

On November 28, 2010, Sharpe was nominated as a semi-finalist for induction into the 2011 Pro Football Hall of Fame, along with Art Modell and 24 others, among them Jerome Bettis, Roger Craig, Marshall Faulk, and Deion Sanders. Subsequently, on February 6, 2011, Shannon Sharpe was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

== Sportscasting and podcasting career ==

Sharpe was a commentator for the CBS Sports pregame show &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, including the &quot;Sprint Halftime Report&quot; and the &quot;Subway Postgame Show&quot;, replacing Deion Sanders and co-hosting with James Brown (formerly with &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;), former NFL quarterbacks Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason, as well as former coach Bill Cowher. In the 2004 NFL regular season, Sharpe defeated Marino and Esiason in the pick &#x27;em game of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; with a 53–21 record. On February 18, 2014, it was announced that Sharpe, along with Dan Marino, were being relieved of their duties as on-air commentators on &quot;The NFL Today&quot; and were being replaced by Tony Gonzalez and Bart Scott.

In 2013, Sharpe became a columnist and spokesperson for FitnessRX For &quot;Men&quot; magazine and appeared on their September 2013 cover. Sharpe has hosted Sirius NFL Radio&#x27;s &quot;Opening Drive&quot; morning program, alongside Bob Papa.

After his retirement, Sharpe has been a social media staple, going viral for his antics and sports commentary. He is also notably a huge supporter of NBA player LeBron James, referring to him as the greatest basketball player in NBA history. He also appeared on the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;The Scarlett Getter&quot;, portraying himself.

Sharpe joined Skip Bayless in FS1&#x27;s sports debate show &quot;Skip and Shannon: Undisputed&quot; which premiered on September 6, 2016. In addition to his defense of LeBron James, Sharpe was also known for his criticism of Tom Brady and the Dallas Cowboys on the show. On May 31, 2023, it was announced that Sharpe would soon leave &quot;Undisputed&quot; after reaching a buyout agreement with Fox Sports. On June 13, Sharpe co-hosted his last episode of &quot;Undisputed&quot;. He later confirmed that he and Bayless had a falling out following an argument where Bayless compared Sharpe&#x27;s NFL career to Tom Brady&#x27;s.

Sharpe also has multiple podcasts: &quot;Club Shay Shay&quot; (which he hosts) and &quot;Nightcap&quot; (which he hosts with Chad Ochocinco Johnson and Gilbert Arenas). The episode of &quot;Club Shay Shay&quot; featuring Bubba Wallace was selected by the Apple Podcasts editorial team on their &quot;Apple Podcasts Best of 2021&quot; list. Both podcasts have been nominated for and won multiple awards for online media.

On August 23, 2023, it was announced that Sharpe and his &quot;Club Shay Shay&quot; podcast would join The Volume, a digital podcast network founded by Colin Cowherd under a multi-year deal. The following day, Sharpe was announced to join &quot;First Take&quot; as a recurring panelist, beginning on September 4, 2023. He appeared every Monday and Tuesday during the 2023 NFL season. On February 16, 2024, it was officially announced that Sharpe signed a contract extension to remain on the show. In June 2024, Sharpe had officially signed a new multi-year contract extension with ESPN which will also allow him to expand his role on &quot;First Take&quot;.

On September 12, &quot;Nightcap&quot; streamed &quot;The Roast of Shannon Sharpe&quot;, with special guests including Lavell Crawford, Kai Cenat, Godfrey, Cam Newton, and Snoop Dogg.

==Personal life==
On February 10, 2023, former NFL quarterback Brett Favre began a lawsuit against Sharpe and fellow former NFL player Pat McAfee, as well as Mississippi auditor Shad White, for making &quot;defamatory charges&quot; about Favre&#x27;s involvement in a $77 million welfare fraud scheme. A representative for Favre stated that Sharpe and McAfee &quot;tried to enhance their careers by fabricating unsubstantiated defamation charges against [Favre].&quot; The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of Mississippi and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal.

In May 2023, Sharpe&#x27;s Los Angeles home was burglarized with over $1 million worth of items stolen, according to several media reports. Obvious signs of forced entry were not found by the police. Sharpe announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

On September 11, 2024, Sharpe inadvertently made a sextape by starting an Instagram Live in which he was engaged in sexual intercourse, although only audio could be heard. Sharpe initially denied his involvement in the act, stating his account was hacked. Later that night, he admitted on &quot;Nightcap&quot; that the video was authentic and apologized for his actions.

<text>The German New Guinea Company () was a German Chartered Company which exploited insular territory in and near present Papua New Guinea.

== History ==
In the 1870s and 1880s German commercial firms began to site trading stations in New Guinea. Agents of J.C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn reached the Bismarck Archipelago from the Caroline Islands in 1872. In 1875 Hersheim &amp; Company moved to the Archipelago.

In 1884, the New Guinea Company was founded in Berlin by Adolph von Hansemann and a syndicate of German bankers for the purpose of colonizing and exploiting resources on &quot;Neuguinea&quot; (German New Guinea), where German interest grew after British Queensland&#x27;s annexation of part of eastern New Guinea. 
This expedition was with the knowledge and blessing of the German Chancellor, Count Otto von Bismarck, and with secrecy and speed an expedition was fitted out under Dr Otto Finsch, ornithologist and explorer.
His task was to select land for plantation development on the north-east coast of New Guinea and establish trading posts. Its influence soon grew to encompass the entire north-eastern part of New Guinea and some of the islands off the coast.

The Neuguinea Compagnie expedition left Sydney for New Guinea in the steamer &quot;Samoa&quot; captained by Eduard Dallmann. On 19 August, Chancellor Bismarck ordered the establishment of a German protectorate in the New Britain Archipelago and north-eastern New Guinea.

German colonial rule in New Guinea lasted for a period of thirty years, For the first fifteen years the colony was administered under imperial charters by a private company, in the manner of the old British and Dutch East India companies, but with far less success. From 1899 to 1914, the Imperial Government administered German New Guinea through a governor, who was assisted after 1904 by a nominated Government Council.

When the Imperial Government took over the running of the colony in 1899, its overriding objective was rapid economic development, based on a German- controlled plantation economy.

<text>Buranda railway station is located on the Cleveland line in Queensland, Australia. It is one of two stations serving the Brisbane suburb of Woolloongabba, the other being Park Road.

West of the station, the line joins the Beenleigh line via a triangle junction.

==History==
Buranda station opened in 1889 as Logan Road station, being renamed Buranda in July 1917.

On 15 July 1996, the Fisherman Islands line to the Port of Brisbane opened to the north of the station.

In the early hours of 29 March 2009, the main station building on platform one was destroyed by fire. A 17-year-old man was later charged with one count of arson following the incident.

From 8 January 2024, the station was temporarily closed for an accessibility upgrade. This upgrade includes additions of lifts, raised platforms, hearing loops and disability compliant ticket windows. It is expected to reopen in 2025. During this upgrade, trains do not stop at this station.

==Services==
The station is served by Cleveland line services from Shorncliffe, Northgate, Doomben and Bowen Hills to Cannon Hill, Manly and Cleveland.
During the accessibility upgrade, trains do not stop at this station.

==Services by platform==
During the accessibility upgrade, trains do not stop at this station.
==Transport links==
Adjacent to the station lies Buranda busway station that is served by Transport for Brisbane bus services.

<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, a Gerstenhaber algebra (sometimes called an antibracket algebra or braid algebra) is an algebraic structure discovered by Murray Gerstenhaber (1963) that combines the structures of a supercommutative ring and a graded Lie superalgebra. It is used in the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism. It appears also in the generalization of Hamiltonian 
formalism known as the De Donder–Weyl theory as the algebra of generalized Poisson brackets defined on differential forms.

==Definition==
A Gerstenhaber algebra is a graded-commutative algebra with a Lie bracket of degree −1 satisfying the Poisson identity. Everything is understood to satisfy the usual superalgebra sign conventions. More precisely, the algebra has two products, one written as ordinary multiplication and one written as [,], and a Z-grading called degree (in theoretical physics sometimes called ghost number). The degree of an element &quot;a&quot; is denoted by |&quot;a&quot;|. These satisfy the identities
*(&quot;ab&quot;)&quot;c&quot; = &quot;a&quot;(&quot;bc&quot;) (The product is associative)
*&quot;ab&quot; = (−1)|&quot;a&quot;||&quot;b&quot;|&quot;ba&quot; (The product is (super) commutative)
*|&quot;ab&quot;| = |&quot;a&quot;| + |&quot;b&quot;| (The product has degree 0)
*|[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]| = |&quot;a&quot;| + |&quot;b&quot;| − 1 (The Lie bracket has degree −1)
*[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;bc&quot;] = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]&quot;c&quot; + (−1)(|&quot;a&quot;|−1)|&quot;b&quot;|&quot;b&quot;[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;] (Poisson identity)
*[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] = −(−1)(|&quot;a&quot;|−1)(|&quot;b&quot;|−1) [&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;] (Antisymmetry of Lie bracket)
*[&quot;a&quot;,[&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;]] = &quot;a&quot;|−1)(|&quot;b&quot;|−1)[&quot;b&quot;,[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot; (The Jacobi identity for the Lie bracket)

Gerstenhaber algebras differ from Poisson superalgebras in that the Lie bracket has degree −1 rather than degree 0. The Jacobi identity may also be expressed in a symmetrical form
:formula_1

==Examples==
*Gerstenhaber showed that the Hochschild cohomology H*(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) of an algebra &quot;A&quot; is a Gerstenhaber algebra.
*A Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra has an underlying Gerstenhaber algebra if one forgets its second order Δ operator.
*The exterior algebra of a Lie algebra is a Gerstenhaber algebra.
*The differential forms on a Poisson manifold form a Gerstenhaber algebra.
*The multivector fields on a manifold form a Gerstenhaber algebra using the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket

<text>Purveyance was an ancient prerogative right of the English Crown to purchase provisions and other necessaries for the royal household, at an appraised price, and to requisition horses and vehicles for royal use. It was finally abolished in 1660.

==History==

===Under Edwards I–III===

The right was developed in England over the course of the late eleventh through the fourteenth centuries. In theory, the king&#x27;s prerogative allowed him to collect goods needed for both household and military use, but the latter was discontinued in 1362. The primary problem with the system was that it was open to abuse from corrupt officials, who would often requisition goods and sell them for profit or use extortion and other means to obtain items or money that was not passed on or divulged to the king. Accordingly, English kings established numerous, though somewhat ineffectual, statutes in an attempt to limit the corruption.

When Edward I and the English Army invaded Scotland, with little agricultural productivity, they used purveyances. The English court had, of old, a right of customary purchase of food for the poor. The right was called prise. Edward took this and grossly expanded it to make the institution called purveyance. The sheriffs would buy food at a set price in the shires and the sellers had to sell at the government price. The government then created a system to store the food. Edward created a convoy system to move mountains of food from the English Midlands to southern Scotland, which the English controlled. Administrative historians say this was a real triumph in organizational power of government, but also a racket because Edward paid late and low.

Edward I also employed purveyances for his many Welsh campaigns, utilizing the produce of both the Isle of Anglesey and Ireland. Purveyance was largely the cause for intense dissatisfaction over Edward&#x27;s campaign in Gascony of 1294–8, and in 1298, a nationwide investigation was held into abuses of royal administrators, including purveyors.

Purveyance continued to be the favoured method of the English kings for obtaining food and other necessities for feeding their armies, supplying their castles and garrisons, and supporting their itinerant households. Both Edward II and Edward III used the system heavily: the former in his unsuccessful campaign against Scotland and then in the civil war against Thomas of Lancaster and the latter in his relatively successful campaign against Scotland and then in France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

It was under Edward III that the issue of corruption and abuses that accompanied the collection of goods for military use particularly came to a head. Complaints reached such a feverish pitch in the opening years of the Hundred Years&#x27; War that Edward III launched another nationwide investigation, and effectively removed most purveyors from office. However, purveyance was too valuable a royal privilege to surrender, and it was only in 1362, under intense pressure from Parliament, that Edward III agreed to discontinue purveyance for military use.

===Under Henry V===

When Henry V was preparing for war against France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, he ordered the continuance of purveyance for military purposes, but with the supposed order for all purveyors to be fair and reasonable, not to take any goods from church property, and to pay a fair price. However, many of the purveyors behaved notoriously badly, extorting many foodstuffs from the peasants and either buying at a low price and selling at a high price for a profit, or not paying at all.
Faced by a purveyor with armed men backing him, most peasants did not dare to resist. King Henry, acknowledging the corruption of his purveyors, included in a proclamation that anyone harassed or aggrieved by any captain or soldier should present themselves to the seneschal of the king&#x27;s treasury. Complete justice, the king proclaimed, would be given on his arrival at Southampton. The retention of purveyance as a tool for supplying the growing royal household would eventually come under fire with the Stuarts.

===Abolition===

In the 17th century, purveyance was worth about £40,000 per year to the crown. However, Parliament wanted to put an end to it, though James I would not relinquish that control without financial compensation. Parliament feared this would lead only to further corruption and no changes were made to the system during the reign of James I. During the Commonwealth an &quot;Act for taking away Purveyance and compositions for Purveyance&quot; was passed 12 December 1656 and given assent 9 June 1657. Since all laws of that period were declared null and void upon the Restoration, it would be the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, which finally abolished purveyance and other feudal charges.

<doc id="883048" wikidata="Q493025" url="?curid=883048" title="Edson, Alberta">
<text>Edson is a town in west-central Alberta, Canada. It is located in Yellowhead County, west of Edmonton along the Yellowhead Highway and east of the intersection with Highway 47.

== History ==
The town was founded as Heatherwood, but the name was changed around 1911 in honour of Edson Joseph Chamberlin, vice-president of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. When Edson was declared the local rail centre, smaller communities such as Rosevear (abandoned), Wolf Creek, Carrot Creek and Niton Junction fell into a decline that continues today. In the 1950s, upgrading of Highway 16 caused a dramatic increase in private, commercial and industrial traffic. Today, the Yellowhead Highway carries some of the heaviest traffic flow in Alberta and has been declared the second Trans-Canada Highway. In the 1970s, a revitalized coal industry launched the Cardinal River Coal and Luscar Sterco mines in the area. In the 1980s Pelican Spruce Mills (now Weyerhaeuser Company Limited) and Sundance Forest Industries (now Edson Forest Products a division of West Fraser Timber) became two of Edson&#x27;s major employers. The former hamlets of Glenwood and Grande Prairie Trail were annexed from Yellowhead County by the Town of Edson on 1 January 1984. In 2023, Edson was evacuated due to wildfires, a few weeks later, Edson declared another state of emergency due to floods.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Edson had a population of 8,374 living in 3,386 of its 3,768 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 8,414. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Edson recorded a population of 8,414 living in 3,359 of its 3,762 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 8,475. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

The Town of Edson&#x27;s 2012 municipal census counted a population of 8,646.

== Geography ==
Edson lies in the McLeod River valley, immediately east of the Canadian Rockies foothills. The surrounding landscape consists of primarily taiga forest with sand hills and muskeg. The town is located at an altitude of . Two provincial parks are located west of Edson: Sundance Provincial Park along Sundance Creek and Obed Lake Provincial Park surrounding the three Obed Lakes.

=== Climate ===
Due to Edson&#x27;s high elevation, the community experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;). The highest temperature ever recorded in Edson was on 30 June 2021, with the humidex reaching 41. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 22 January 1943, and 14 January 1950. Summers in Edson are generally mild to warm with chilly nights and moderate precipitation. Winters are long and severely cold with relatively high snowfall, higher than surrounding areas due to the town&#x27;s high elevation.

== Economy ==
The main industries that drive the local economy are resource based – coal, oil, natural gas and forestry products.

== Sports ==
Edson was home to Canada&#x27;s largest slo-pitch tournament until 2017.

== Culture ==
The Galloway Station Museum, established in 1981, explores the history of Edson and the surrounding area. It contains an original Canadian Northern Railway station used by several communities around Edson as well as large modern gallery spaces, an archives and public events space. The museum is located in RCMP Centennial Park, a large park at the centre of town created in 1974 to honour the 100th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Alberta. The park, run by the Town of Edson, also contains an event pavilion, a Canadian National Railway caboose, a preserved RCAF Lockheed T-33 Silver Star aircraft, and giant squirrel statue that depicts the town&#x27;s mascot, &quot;Eddie the Squirrel&quot;.

== Infrastructure ==
Edson is connected to the Yellowhead Highway from east to west and to Coal Valley via Highway 47 to the south.

Via Rail&#x27;s &quot;The Canadian&quot; calls at the Edson railway station twice per week in each direction as a flag stop.

<text>Allen John Jakovich () (born 21 March 1968) is a retired Australian rules football player. Jakovich was a prolific full forward and is notable for kicking 208 goals in his 54 Australian Football League matches, an average of 3.85 per game, for Melbourne and Footscray. He and his younger brother, Glen Jakovich, both began their AFL careers in the 1990 AFL draft.

Jakovich grew up in Western Australia and played football with clubs in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria.
He is of Croatian descent.

==Early career==
Allen Jakovich was the second of three sons for Darko and Mary Jakovich.
Allen represented Western Australia in 1983 for the Secondary Schools U15 competition. He played alongside Chris Lewis, Andrew McGovern, Paul Peos and Chris Waterman who would also go on to play AFL.

Allen played in the 1985 Teal Cup football team for Western Australia. Allen played alongside future West Coast Eagles players Chris Lewis, Paul Peos, Guy McKenna, Chris Waterman, Scott Watters, Peter Sumich and John Worsfold in what was Western Australia&#x27;s first Teal Cup win. Although playing well in Western Australia&#x27;s first two games against Queensland and NSW, Allen Jakovich only scored a single goal in the final against Victoria and was replaced halfway through the 3rd quarter.

Allen followed his older brother Garry (4 Senior Games in 1984) and began his senior career with South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League. Over the 1985 and 1986 seasons, Allen played 7 games in the seniors and kicked 22 Goals at an average of 3.14 goals per game. As of 2025 this was the 9th best goals per game average for the club. Noting that Mark Jackson is in 10th place with 100 goals from 32 games (3.13 goals per game). Also noting that no player since Allen Jakovich played has had more goals per game for the club.

Allen kicked 62 goals for the Colts 1984 season and was an important part of the Bulldogs premiership victory. In Round 4 of the 1985 Season for the Colts, Allen kicked 10 goals against Subiaco.

Jakovich left the club in 1987.

He then played in towns in outback Western Australia such as Port Hedland and Kalgoorlie.
It was while playing at Port Hedland that Allen Jakovich met Brian Hood who was the Coach of the NTFL team Southern Districts. Brian convinced Allen to join Southern Districts for the 1988/1989 season.

==NTFL career==
He then played in the Northern Territory Football League, including the 1988/89 season in which he kicked 104 goals for Southern Districts.

==SANFL career==
Jakovich later moved to South Australia and played in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) playing for Woodville. In the 1989 season he kicked 85 goals. In the 1990 season he kicked 101 goals. It was this performance that drew the attention of Melbourne Football Club talent scouts.

==AFL career==
1991 Season

He debuted in the seniors in round 1 against the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco but was quickly dropped for the following week. Jakovich played in the Melbourne reserves and dominated the reserves competition in the first half of the 1991 season.

In the second half, though, he burst out convincingly and big hauls came on an almost weekly basis for the rest of the season making a big impression in the league with his confident playing style. A high point was a near single handed defeat of North Melbourne where he kicked 11 goals (including a miraculous scissor kick out of mid-air from twenty metres out, a certain goal of the year candidate), 8 behinds and one out on the full. This effort also earned Jakovich the distinction of being the fastest player to score his first fifty goals, taking only nine games to do so. He finished with 71 goals for his debut season; becoming one of a handful of players in VFL/AFL history to kick 50 goals in both the senior competition and now defunct &#x27;reserves&#x27; league within the same season.

1992 Season

He kicked his 100th career goal in his 21st game, equalling the record held by John Coleman.

1993 Season

He kissed his brother Glen during a match between Melbourne and the West Coast Eagles at the MCG.

1994 Season

Over the past three years at Melbourne he balanced some mercurial performances with fitness problems and indifferent form. He was let go at the start of 1995, due to a persistent back injury.
1995 Season

He spent the year out of the game recovering from a back injury before being drafted by the Footscray Football Club.

1996 Season

An ill-fated comeback that lasted barely half a season.

In his AFL career, he kicked 208 goals and 173 behinds.

and in a wide-ranging interview on the Demonland podcast in 2017 and also two appearances on The Front Bar in 2018.

<text>In theoretical physics, an analysis of flows is the study of &quot;gauge&quot; or &quot;gaugelike&quot; &quot;symmetries&quot; (i.e. flows the formulation of a theory is invariant under). It is generally agreed that flows indicate nothing more than a redundancy in the description of the dynamics of a system, but often, it is simpler computationally to work with a redundant description.

== Flows in classical mechanics ==

=== Flows in the action formalism ===
Classically, the action is a functional on the configuration space. The on-shell solutions are given by the variational problem of extremizing the action subject to boundary conditions.

While the boundary is often ignored in textbooks, it is crucial in the study of flows. Suppose we have a &quot;flow&quot;, i.e. the generator of a smooth one-dimensional group of transformations of the configuration space, which maps on-shell states to on-shell states while preserving the boundary conditions. Because of the variational principle, the action for all of the configurations on the orbit is the same. This is &quot;not&quot; the case for more general transformations which map on shell to on shell states but change the boundary conditions.

Here are several examples. In a theory with translational symmetry, timelike translations are &quot;not&quot; flows because in general they change the boundary conditions. However, now take the case of a simple harmonic oscillator, where the boundary points are at a separation of a multiple of the period from each other, and the initial and final positions are the same at the boundary points. For this particular example, it turns out there &quot;is&quot; a flow. Even though this is technically a flow, this would usually not be considered a gauge symmetry because it is not local.

Flows can be given as derivations over the algebra of smooth functionals over the configuration space. If we have a flow distribution (i.e. flow-valued distribution) such that the flow convolved over a local region only affects the field configuration in that region, we call the flow distribution a &quot;gauge flow&quot;.

Given that we are only interested in what happens on shell, we would often take the quotient by the ideal generated by the Euler–Lagrange equations, or in other words, consider the equivalence class of functionals/flows which agree on shell.

=== Flows in the Hamiltonian formalism ===
* First class constraints
* Second class constraints
* BRST formalism
* Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism

<doc id="883073" wikidata="Q6736034" url="?curid=883073" title="Main Plot">
<text>The Main Plot was an alleged conspiracy of July 1603 by English courtiers to remove King James I from the English throne and to replace him with his cousin Lady Arbella Stuart. The plot was supposedly led by Lord Cobham and funded by the Spanish government. In a state trial, the defendants accused of involvement in the Main Plot were tried along with those of the Bye Plot. It is referred to as the &quot;main&quot; plot, because at the time it was presented as the principal (&quot;main&quot;) plot of which the secondary (or &quot;bye&quot;) plot was a minor component.

In the version of the plot presented at trial, Cobham was negotiating with the Count of Aremberg to contact the Spanish court in order to obtain a very large sum of money (approximately £160,000). He was to travel to Brussels, then to Spain, collect the money, and go back to England via Jersey, where Sir Walter Raleigh was governor. Raleigh and Cobham were then to divide up the money and decide how best to spend it in furtherance of sedition.

==Investigation==
The plot was discovered during an investigation of the Bye Plot in which Sir George Brooke, the brother of Lord Cobham, was implicated. The effort of examining the evidence gathered from suspects questioned in the far-fetched Bye Plot fell to William Waad. He teased out the &quot;main&quot; or serious plot, as he saw it and involving the highly placed Raleigh, from the rest of the &quot;bye&quot; plot; and presented his findings to Sir Robert Cecil and the Privy Council.

==Consequences==
Cobham and Raleigh were both imprisoned in the Tower of London as was Sir Griffin Markham. Raleigh was released after thirteen years, but was eventually executed in 1618. The sick Cobham was released in the same year, dying some months later.

<text>Ángel Víctor Paz Estenssoro (2 October 1907 – 7 June 2001) was a Bolivian politician who served as the 45th president of Bolivia for three nonconsecutive and four total terms from 1952 to 1956, 1960 to 1964 and 1985 to 1989. He ran for president eight times (1947, 1951, 1960, 1964, 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1985) and was victorious in 1951, 1960, 1964 and 1985. His 1951 victory was annulled by a military junta led by Hugo Ballivián, and his 1964 victory was interrupted by the 1964 Bolivian coup d&#x27;état.

==Founding of the MNR and early political years (1941–1952)==
In 1941 Víctor Paz Estenssoro co-founded (along with Hernán Siles and others) the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, MNR), originally a reformist revolutionary movement and later a centrist party. Paz became an influential member in the cabinet of Colonel Gualberto Villarroel (1943–1946), but was forced out of that government as a result of pressure emanating from Washington. The United States was at the time involved in World War II, and suspected some members of the MNR leadership of harboring pro-fascist sympathies. Paz Estenssoro nonetheless ran for president in 1947, earning 3rd place, and again in 1951, when the MNR surprisingly won the electoral contest, despite the fact that the laws of that time confined the vote to a small, propertied stratum of the citizenry. The elections, however, were unilaterally annulled by the ultra-conservative government of Mamerto Urriolagoitía, and the MNR at that point went underground, coming to power after a popular national revolution the next year.

Among the many important structural reforms adopted by the popular Paz Estenssoro government was the extension of universal suffrage to all adult citizens (natives and illiterates included), the nationalization of the largest tin-mining concerns, and an extensive program of land distribution (agrarian reform). Much of the military, which had served so well the interests of the economic elites prior to the Revolution, was dismantled and re-organized as a virtual arm of the MNR party. Clearly, the idea was to fashion a hegemonic party in the image of Mexico&#x27;s Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI). The crucial difference between the MNR and PRI was the decidedly de-centralised structure of the country&#x27;s new military power (i.e., armed workers and peasants), which was largely overseen by the left-wing minority bloc in the MNR, headed by the Bolivian Workers&#x27; Center (COB) leader, Juan Lechín.

==Paz Estenssoro&#x27;s temporary retirement and polarization of the MNR (1956–1960)==
Paz was not allowed to run for another consecutive term, and Hernán Siles was elected, serving as President from 1956 until 1960. During the Hernán Siles administration, the MNR began to polarize and fragment, with a conservative wing led by Wálter Guevara and an increasingly assertive left-leaning faction commanded by the charismatic COB leader Lechín. To prevent the fracturing of his party, Paz returned from London (where he had been serving as Bolivian ambassador) and ran for re-election in 1960, winning with an ample majority of the votes. His choice as vice-presidential running mate was the increasingly hard-to-manage Juan Lechín, an action that prompted the defection from the MNR of Wálter Guevara, who felt he had been stepped over.

==Second and third Paz Estenssoro governments, 1960–1964==
The second Paz Estenssoro administration was plagued by violence, dissent, and continued hemorraghing of the original leadership. Of great importance during this period was the thorny issue of disarming the miners and workers&#x27; militias who had combatted in the 1952 Revolution and who had been for the most allowed to keep their weapons since. They had served as a useful counterbalance to the possibility of a conservative or military reassertion against the Revolution, but by 1960 were serving the interests of the party&#x27;s radical left vice-president Lechín. Of Marxist political persuasion, the latter opposed the disarming of the militias and the reconstitution of the traditional military, urged the passing of more far-reaching reforms. Paz Estenssoro disagreed and, continuing the policies started by Siles, increasingly leaned on the &quot;new&quot; armed forces for support. This produced the inevitable final rift, and Lechín was expelled from the party prior to the 1964 elections.

Increasingly unable to control events, and considering himself the only man who could keep the MNR coalition together, in 1964 Paz decided to amend the constitution to allow himself to run for re-election. Traditionally, attempts such as these (known as &quot;prorroguismo&quot;) have been strongly condemned by the Bolivian political elites, many of whose members may have been waiting for their turn to occupy the presidential palace for years. This was no exception, and Paz&#x27;s move ended up being his undoing. To symbolize Paz&#x27;s steady rightward drift, he chose the charismatic commander of the Bolivian Air Force, General René Barrientos, as his running mate. To be fair, Paz&#x27;s increased reliance on the armed forces was to some extent influenced by Washington&#x27;s constant demands that the military be fully reconstituted and equipped to fight possible Cuban-style Communist insurgencies. In any case, the René Barrientos choice was a final act of folly, as Paz did not seem to have noticed the deep resentment of the outwardly loyal commanders of the &quot;new, revolutionary&quot; military toward the MNR&#x27;s manipulation of the armed forces for political ends.

==The 1964 coup d&#x27;état and exile==
On 4 November 1964, the MNR government was overthrown in a military coup led by vice-president René Barrientos and Alfredo Ovando, commander of the army. Paz flew to a long exile to Lima, Peru, bitter toward René Barrientos&#x27; betrayal and unhappy that the &quot;Revolution&quot; had taken such a sad turn. It was not until 1982 (with minor and very temporary exceptions) that military rule ended. By this time Paz and Hernán Siles Zuazo had split, with Siles supporting more leftist policies. Wálter Guevara, for his part, had supported Barrientos and served in his administration. In 1969 Barrientos died in a helicopter crash and new, populist military governments of progressive bend gained power in Bolivia (1970–1971).

==Support for Banzer and erosion of support (1971–1978)==
When the &quot;excesses&quot; of the left-leaning Torres military government (1970–71) became unbearable to most civilian elites of centrist and conservative persuasion, Torres was overthrown in a bloody coup d&#x27;état led by then-Colonel Hugo Banzer with the MNR&#x27;s full support. This too was a move that would cost Paz and his party dearly in the years to come, especially in future elections. Paz was apparently under the impression that Banzer would rule for a year or two before calling elections. Presumably, since the MNR was still by some distance the largest party in the country, this would allow Paz to return to the presidency. However, Banzer had other ideas. He broke with the MNR in 1974, exiled Paz, and proceeded to rule only with military support until 1978.

==The turmoil of 1978–1985==
While Paz had tarnished his image by associating himself with the reviled Hugo Banzer dictatorship, Hernán Siles was turning steadily to the left and gaining adherents at Paz&#x27;s expense. When at long last elections were called in 1978, it was apparently Hernán Siles who won it (there were vast irregularities and the elections were annulled), with Paz getting only third place. It was a major decline from what the MNR had been used to obtaining in the 1950s and early 1960s. Elections were rescheduled for 1979, and when they took place Hernán Siles won again but this time Paz got second place. The elections again proved inconclusive, however, in as much as none of the candidates polled the required 50% of the vote to win direct election, and thus the outcome was to be decided by Congress. Partisan intransigences prevailed and the latter could not agree on any of the candidates, eventually settling on naming as provisional President the head of the senate, Wálter Guevara, then in alliance with Paz&#x27;s MNR. He was charged with calling elections again in 1980. Those elections reconfirmed Hernán Siles&#x27; victory and Paz&#x27;s second place, but the military intervened rather than allow Hernán Siles (now associated with parties deemed to be from the &quot;far left&quot;) to take office. General Luis García Meza grabbed the reins of power in the bloody coup d&#x27;état of 17 July 1980, and Paz once more flew to exile. In 1982, the beleaguered military finally left the Palacio Quemado and confirmed the results of the 1980 elections, making Hernán Siles president.

Paz&#x27;s MNR opposed Hernán Siles on every front, as his administration plunged the country into a hyperinflationary spiral. In fact, this was Bolivia&#x27;s most serious economic crisis in its history, one largely prompted by the collapse of international tin prices and the onset of the Latin American debt crisis. The gravity of the situation prompted &quot;Congreso Nacional&quot; (National Congress) to prevail upon Hernán Siles to call early elections in 1985. Paz again came second (this time to former dictator Hugo Banzer) but was elected president by &quot;Congreso Nacional&quot; since, as usual, none of the parties had attained the 50% threshold for direct election. It was in fact the first time an opposition party gained power peacefully in a free election, even though there had long been multi-party competition in elections.

==Fourth and last Paz Estenssoro presidency (1985–1989)==
The now-nearly octogenarian Paz began his fourth (and final) term as President in 1985. The economic situation was indeed dire, but Paz and his aides had a radical neo-liberal plan. Through Decree 21060 important economic reforms designed to curb galloping hyperinflation (inherited from Hernán Siles) were instituted, the labor unions were repressed in order to reestablish government authority, and 30,000 miners were expunged from state payrolls to reduce the size of the government. Up until the economic restructuring was announced, Paz and his planning team had not informed the rest of his cabinet or the public of the direction in which they were moving, knowing that it would be met with mass protest and strike action. One member of Paz&#x27;s economic team compared their approach to the bombing of Hiroshima with nuclear weapons. The reforms were in many ways the opposite of what Paz had represented to his voters. As a result, the policies were met with protest. In the months following the announcement of Decree 21060, a curfew was imposed on citizens, travel throughout the country restricted, universities and opposition meetings were raided, and hundreds of union leaders were kidnapped and taken to prison camps in the Amazon until strikes were called off. 

The readjustment policies—conducted to a large extent by Paz Estenssoro&#x27;s vigorous Minister of Planning, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, who was later to serve as President of Bolivia—came to be known as the New Economic Policy (NEP). The latter restructured the bulk of the hitherto-statist Bolivian economy and transformed it into a neo-liberal, privatization-oriented one, and successfully contained hyperinflation. However, Bolivia remained the poorest country in South America and anti neo-liberal forces began to grow as a result of his liberal economic policies leading to the election of socialist Evo Morales in 2005.

Paz finished his term and finally retired from politics upon leaving office in 1989. He died by his home in Tarija on 7 June 2001.

<doc id="883082" wikidata="Q721376" url="?curid=883082" title="Naked Cowboy">
<text>Robert John Burck (born December 23, 1970), better known as the Naked Cowboy, is an American street performer, singer, songwriter, and occasional actor. He is best known for singing regularly in New York City&#x27;s Times Square. Burck is also a regular in the streets of the French Quarter during the New Orleans Mardi Gras season. He wears only cowboy boots, a hat, and white briefs, with a guitar strategically placed to give the illusion of nudity.

On October 6, 2010, Burck formally announced that he was running for President of the United States in the 2012 U.S. election as a candidate representing the U.S. Tea Party movement.

==Background==
Burck was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended Our Lady of the Rosary elementary school in nearby Greenhills, Ohio. He later earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of Cincinnati College of Arts and Sciences in 1995. He began busking in December 1997, and first appeared on Venice Beach, Los Angeles.

He is best known as a fixture of Times Square in New York City, where he has appeared almost daily since September 1999. He made an appearance in Donnybrook, Dublin, Ireland, on January 25, 2009, where he performed his theme song &quot;I&#x27;m the Naked Cowboy&quot; at a Leinster Rugby game before 18,000 spectators. In May 2014, Burck temporarily switched from his usual briefs to boxer briefs, after being sponsored by Fruit of the Loom.

On November 11, 2020, while Burck was performing in New York in front of a few tourists, a person pulled down and ripped his briefs.

===Music===
Burck has made appearances in three music videos, including Cake&#x27;s &quot;Short Skirt/Long Jacket&quot;, Tyler Hilton&#x27;s &quot;When It Comes&quot;, and Nickelback&#x27;s &quot;Rockstar&quot;. In 2007, Burck released an album of his own, signing to 4Sight Music Productions and recording the pop-rock album &quot;Year of the Cowboy&quot; produced by Lee Evans and producer Dante Lattanzi at JAMBOX Recording Studios in New York City. The album was featured on MTV News.

===Politics===
On July 20, 2009, it was announced that Burck would challenge Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the 2009 New York City mayoral election. In response, Jonny Porkpie, the self-proclaimed &quot;burlesque Mayor of NYC&quot; announced that he would run against him. On September 5, 2009, Burck withdrew from the race.

On September 29, 2010, he announced his intentions to challenge President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. At his announcement, Burck stated that he has a &quot;very conservative policy&quot; and that he had an &quot;unapologetic commitment to our borders, our language and our culture&quot;, borrowing a well-known catchphrase of radio host Michael Savage. He changed his appearance by wearing a dress suit and had his hair cut. On October 6, 2010, Burck officially declared his presidential candidacy at a press conference in Times Square. He stated that he was neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but rather &quot;an American&quot; and that he intended to lead the U.S. Tea Party movement into the Oval Office.

Bloomberg referenced the Naked Cowboy during the tenth 2020 Democratic primary debate in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 25, 2020. When asked whether he would support expanding his signature soda ban policy nationwide, Bloomberg stated that what is right for one city is not necessarily right for every city, &quot;otherwise every town would have a Naked Cowboy.&quot;

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in December 2020, Burck is &quot;a big Trump supporter.&quot; He participated in a rally in Washington, D.C., prior to the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.

==Infringement lawsuits filed==

===Mars Inc.===
Mars, Incorporated created a short animation of the Blue M&amp;M&#x27;s character playing a guitar while dressed in a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots and underpants on the electronic animation display that hangs outside the M&amp;M&#x27;s store at Times Square. Burck, who owns registered trademarks to the Naked Cowboy name and likeness, filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Mars Incorporated on February 15, 2008.

Burck alleged that the ads infringe on his trademark by &quot;using his likeness, persona, and image for commercial purposes without his written permission and by falsely suggesting that he endorses M&amp;M&#x27;s candy.&quot; The Cowboy&#x27;s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, requested an injunction stopping Mars from using the Naked Cowboy&#x27;s likeness to advertise M&amp;M&#x27;s products, up to $100 million in punitive damages, and attorney&#x27;s fees. On June 23, 2008, the court issued a decision that dismissed a portion of the suit relying on New York law but rejected a motion by the defendants to dismiss the trademark claims. Burck and Mars Incorporated settled the lawsuit in November 2008, the terms of which were never disclosed.

===CBS===
Burck filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against CBS in February 2011, saying the network&#x27;s use of a &#x27;Naked Cowboy&#x27;–like figure in an ad for a television show demeaned his image with CBS&#x27;s &quot;drunk and sexually charged&quot; portrayal of his likeness.

==Personal life==
On February 15, 2013, Burck married Patricia Burck, a woman from Mexico City who was 25 at the time. Patricia is a professional belly dancer and group fitness instructor, is also a licensed Naked Cowgirl franchisee.

Burck is a resident of Queens.

===Arrest===
On March 6, 2021, Burck was arrested in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he was appearing at Daytona Beach Bike Week. He was arrested on charges of panhandling and resisting an officer without violence, as his act violated Daytona Beach&#x27;s panhandling policies. After spending a night in jail, Burck entered a plea of no contest to the resisting an officer without violence charge.

Following his plea, the judge involved in Burck&#x27;s case withheld adjudication on the resisting arrest charge, making it not appear as a conviction on his criminal record, dropped the panhandling charge, and sentenced Burck to time served. Following his release, Burck reportedly received a &quot;hero&#x27;s welcome&quot; from attendees at Daytona Beach Bike Week after he returned and a local music store, along with Takamine, donated him a new acoustic guitar to replace the one that was damaged during his arrest. In May 2021, it was reported that Burck had asked a judge to allow him to withdraw his no contest plea and that his attorney sent a letter stating that he plans to sue the Daytona Beach Police Department over the arrest. On July 20, 2022, Burck, having sued the city and the two arresting police officers, received a $90,000 settlement.

<text>Glaresis is a genus of beetles, sometimes called &quot;Enigmatic scarab beetles&quot;, in its own family, Glaresidae. It is closely related to, and was formerly included in, the family Scarabaeidae. Although its members occur in arid and sandy areas worldwide (except Australia), only the nocturnal adults have ever been collected (typically at lights), and both the larvae and biology of &quot;Glaresis&quot; are as yet unknown. Due to their narrow habitat associations, a great number of these species occur in extremely limited geographic areas, and are accordingly imperiled by habitat destruction.

These beetles are small, 2.5–6 mm long, and have the stocky appearance typical of fossorial scarabs, with short, heavy, spurred legs. Color ranges from tan to dark brown, and the back is covered with short setae.

Efforts to raise glaresids in the laboratory were undertaken in the 1980s by C. H. Scholtz and others, but were unsuccessful.

&quot;Glaresis&quot; was originally classified with Trogidae (originally a subfamily within Scarabaeidae), and has many characteristics of &quot;primitive&quot; scarabaeoids, but no affinities to any of the other primitive groups; recent work suggests that they may in fact belong in Trogidae. Scholtz argued that &quot;Glaresis&quot; is the most primitive type of scarabaeoid, but more recent research indicates that the Pleocomidae hold this position. The species in North, Central, and South America have been revised by Robert Gordon and Guy Hanley, January 2014, in the journal &quot;Insecta Mundi&quot;.

<doc id="883094" wikidata="Q1165714" url="?curid=883094" title="The Charterhouse of Parma">
<text>The Charterhouse of Parma () is a novel by French writer Stendhal, published in 1839. Telling the story of an Italian nobleman in the Napoleonic era and later, it was admired by Balzac, Tolstoy, André Gide, Lampedusa, Henry James, and Ernest Hemingway. It was inspired by an inauthentic Italian account of the dissolute youth of Alessandro Farnese. The novel has been adapted for opera, film and television.

The title refers to a Carthusian monastery, which is only mentioned on the last page of the novel and does not figure significantly in the plot.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot; chronicles the adventures of the young Italian nobleman Fabrice del Dongo from his birth in 1798 to his death. Fabrice spends his early years in his family&#x27;s castle on Lake Como, while most of the rest of the novel is set in a fictionalized Parma (both locations are in modern-day Italy).

The book begins with the French army sweeping into Milan and stirring up the sleepy region of Lombardy, which was allied with Austria. Fabrice grows up surrounded by intrigues and alliances for and against the French — his father the Marchese comically fancies himself a spy for the Viennese. It is broadly hinted at that Fabrice may have actually been fathered by a visiting French lieutenant. The novel&#x27;s early section describes Fabrice&#x27;s rather quixotic effort to join Napoleon when the latter returns to France in March 1815 (the Hundred Days). Fabrice at seventeen is idealistic, rather naïve, and speaks poor French. However, he will not be stopped and leaves his home on Lake Como to travel north with false papers. He wanders through France, losing money and horses rapidly. He is imprisoned as a spy, but escapes with the aid of the jailer&#x27;s wife who develops a fondness towards Fabrice, donning the uniform of a dead French hussar. In his excitement to play the role of a French soldier, he wanders onto the field at the Battle of Waterloo.

Stendhal, a veteran of several Napoleonic campaigns (he was one of the survivors of the retreat from Moscow in 1812), describes this famous battle as a chaotic affair: soldiers gallop one way and then another as bullets plow the fields around them. Fabrice briefly joins the guard of Field Marshal Ney, randomly comes across the man who may be his father (he commandeers Fabrice&#x27;s horse), shoots one Prussian cavalryman while he and his regiment flee, and is lucky to survive with a serious wound to his leg (inflicted by a retreating French cavalryman). He eventually returns to his family&#x27;s castle, injured, broke, and still wondering, &quot;was I really in the battle?&quot; Fabrice is quickly forced to flee since his older brother - sickly and dull - denounces him. Towards the end of the novel, his efforts, such as they are, lead people to say that he was one of Napoleon&#x27;s bravest captains or colonels.

The novel divides its attention between him and his aunt Gina (his father&#x27;s sister). Gina meets and befriends the Prime Minister of Parma, Count Mosca. Count Mosca proposes that Gina marry a wealthy old man, the Duke Sanseverina, who will be out of the country for many years as an ambassador, so that she and Count Mosca can be lovers while living under the social rules of the time. Gina responds, &quot;But you realize that what you are suggesting is utterly immoral?&quot; Nevertheless, she agrees, and so a few months later, Gina is the new social eminence in Parma&#x27;s rather small aristocratic elite.

Gina (now the Duchess Sanseverina) has had very warm feelings for her nephew ever since he returned from France. Since going to join Napoleon was officially illegal, she and Count Mosca try to plan out a successful rehabilitation for the young man. Count Mosca&#x27;s plan has Fabrice go to seminary school in Naples, with the idea that when he graduates he will come to Parma and become a senior figure in the religious hierarchy, and eventually the Archbishop, as the current office holder is old. The fact that Fabrice has no interest in religion (or celibacy) matters not to this plan. Fabrice reluctantly agrees and leaves for Naples.

The book then describes in great detail how Gina and Count Mosca live and operate in the court of the Prince of Parma (named Ranuce-Erneste IV). Stendhal, who spent decades as a professional diplomat in northern Italy, gives a lively and interesting account of the court, though all of what he describes is entirely fictional, as Parma was ruled by Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma during the time of the novel. (Marie Louise was Napoleon&#x27;s second wife.)

After several years of theology school in Naples, during which he has many affairs with local women, Fabrice returns to Parma. Fabrice had been afraid that he could never fall in love, and he is surprised when he develops romantic feelings towards Gina; the omniscient narrator tells us that she shares the same feelings although the characters never discuss them.

Fabrice becomes involved with a young actress whose manager/lover takes offense and tries to kill Fabrice. In the resulting fight, Fabrice kills the man and flees Parma for Bologna, fearing correctly that he will not be treated justly by the courts. After returning to Parma surreptitiously, Fabrice returns to Bologna, spending much time trying to form a relationship with an attractive soprano, Fausta; in the meantime, the judiciary have found him guilty of the murder. Distressed by these developments indicating that Fabrice may be executed, Gina goes to the Prince to plead for Fabrice&#x27;s life stating she will leave Parma if he is not. While the Prince is alienated by Gina&#x27;s dignity and independence, he fears that his court will become boring without her and that she will speak poorly about his dominion when she departs. He communicates his willingness to free Fabrice and yields to Gina&#x27;s demand that he sign a note to release him. But the Count, in an effort to be diplomatic, omits the crucial phrase: &quot;this unjust procedure will have no further effect.&quot; The following morning, the Prince connives to have Fabrice imprisoned for twelve years by signing an order affixed with a date preceding the note purporting to release him.

For the next nine months, Gina schemes to have Fabrice freed and manages to get secret messages relayed to him in the tower, in part by means of an improvised semaphore line. The Prince keeps spreading rumors that Fabrice is going to be executed as a way to put pressure on Gina. Meanwhile, Fabrice is oblivious to his danger and is living happily because he has fallen in love with the commandant&#x27;s daughter, Clélia Conti, whom Fabrice can see from his prison window as she tends her caged birds. They fall in love, and after some time he persuades her to communicate with him by means of letters of the alphabet printed on sheets ripped from a book.

The happy Fabrice resists Gina&#x27;s plans to escape. But Gina finally persuades him and has Clélia smuggle three long ropes to him. The only thing that concerns Fabrice is whether he will be able to meet Clélia after he escapes. But Clélia – who has feelings of guilt because the plot involved giving laudanum to her father, which she perceived as poison – promises the Virgin that she shall never see Fabrice again and will do anything her father says.

Gina puts in motion a plan to have the Prince of Parma assassinated. This plot is carried out by a poet/bandit/assassin Ferrante who has fallen in unrequited love with Gina. Count Mosca stays in Parma, and when the Prince does die (it is strongly implied that he was poisoned by Ferrante) he puts down a revolt by some local revolutionaries and installs the son of the Prince on the throne. The new Prince (only 21 years old) falls in love with Gina. When the prosecutor&#x27;s indictments come close to the truth behind the uprising, Gina persuades the Prince to burn the documents.

Count Mosca, committed to installing Fabrice as the Vicar General, persuades Gina and Fabrice that Fabrice voluntarily return to be acquitted. Instead of going to the town jail, Fabrice voluntarily returns to the Farnese Tower to be close to Clelia. Seeking revenge, General Conti attempts to poison Fabrice, but Clelia keeps him from eating the poisoned food. A distraught Gina seeks the Prince&#x27;s intervention to have him transferred, and he agrees to do so on the condition she gives herself to him. Gina so promises in duress. After three months, the Prince proposes marriage to Gina but is rejected. Gina submits to his physical demands and leaves immediately afterward. Gina never returns but marries Count Mosca. Clélia marries the wealthy Marchese her father has chosen for her, and Clelia and Fabrice live unhappily.

Once acquitted, Fabrice assumes his duties as the Vicar General in the Catholic Church, and his sermons become the talk of the town. The only reason he gives these sermons, Fabrice says, is in the hope that Clélia will come to one, allowing him to see her and speak to her. After fourteen months of suffering for both, she agrees to meet with him every night, on the condition that it is in darkness, lest she break her vow to the Madonna to never see him again and they both be punished for her sin. A year later she bears Fabrice&#x27;s child. When the boy is two years old, Fabrice insists that he should take care of him in the future, because he is feeling lonely and worries that his own child will not love him. The plan he and Clélia devise is to fake the child&#x27;s illness and death and then establish him secretly in a large house nearby, where Fabrice and Clélia can come to see him every day. After several months the child actually does die, and Clélia dies a few months after that. After her death, Fabrice retires to the titular Charterhouse of Parma (a Carthusian monastery), where he spends less than a year before he also dies. Gina, the Countess Mosca, who had always loved Fabrice, dies a short time after that. The novel ends with the epithet &quot;To the Happy Few.&quot;

==Characters==

The characters in the novel are frequently referred to only by their title of nobility and sometimes by their last name. Furthermore, both of these change during the course of the novel due to marriages and acquisition of titles.

The del Dongos
* Fabrice (aka Fabrizio) del Dongo, second son of the Marchese del Dongo from castle Grianta on Lake Como in the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom. Later referred to as Monsignor. He assumes several aliases and uses false passports, including Vasi (a dealer in barometers), Boulot (a deceased French hussar), Giletti, and Giuseppe Bossi.
* Marchesa del Dongo, Fabrice&#x27;s mother, referred to as the Marchesa.
* Marchese del Dongo, Fabrice&#x27;s father, a cold and reactionary figure.
* Contessa Gina Pietranera, Fabrice&#x27;s aunt and lifelong benefactor, referred to as the Contessa and later as the Duchessa Sanseverina (Sanseverina-Taxis) or simply the Duchessa. (Note: Gina is the Marchese del Dongo&#x27;s sister. Since he is not Fabrice&#x27;s biological father, Gina and Fabrice are not truly related to one another, though neither character understands this).

The Political Aristocracy of Parma
* Prince Ranuccio-Ernesto IV, the ruler of Parma, referred to as the Prince.
* Prince Ernesto V, the son and successor of Ernesto IV, also referred to as the Prince.
* Princess of Parma, Clara-Paolina, wife of Ernesto IV and the mother of Ernesto V, referred to as the Princess.
* Conte Mosca, often referred to as the Conte, Prime Minister of Parma, Minister of Police and several other titles, long time lover of Gina.
* General Fabio Conti, governor of the citadel and prison of Parma.
* Fiscal General Rassi, known as the Fiscal Rassi or Chief Justice, an incompetent and reactionary politician, &quot;a man without honour and without humour.&quot;
* Marchesa Raversi, referred to as the Raversi, Conte Mosca&#x27;s opponent and Rassi&#x27;s co-conspirator, &quot;a consummate intriguer&quot; 
* Father Landriani, Archbishop of Parma

Fabrice&#x27;s Lovers, Friends, and Enemies
* Marietta, a comic actress, Fabrice&#x27;s first lover.
* Giletti, a traveling comic actor, Marietta&#x27;s abusive lover, killed by Fabrice.

* Clelia Conti, daughter of General Fabio Conti, Fabrice&#x27;s last and truest love.
* Marchese Crescenzi a wealthy aristocrat engaged to Clelia.
* Ferrante Palla a genius poet, revolutionary, and perhaps lunatic, living in self-imposed poverty. An ally of Gina with whom he is enthralled.
* Priore Blanès, parish priest of Grianta and astrologer, Fabrice&#x27;s early mentor who made predictions about Fabrice&#x27;s life.
* Ludovico, Fabrice&#x27;s lifelong servant and friend.

==Translations==
The best-known English translation &quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot; is by C. K. Scott Moncrieff (Boni and Liveright, 1925) and translated the French names of Italian characters in the original to Italian equivalents. Thus Fabrice becomes Fabrizio. The translation by Margaret Mauldon (Oxford University Press, 1997) retained the French names, while that by Richard Howard (Modern Library, 1999) uses the Italian names. According to Daniel Mendelsohn of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, this &quot;obscures the important narrative conceit that this whole tale is one we&#x27;re hearing from a Frenchman who has, in turn, heard it from Italians who knew the principals. It is a book about Italians, but one seen through French eyes.&quot; Mendelsohn goes on to say that the translation &quot;moves with admirable rapidity, fully conveying what James called the &#x27;restlessness&#x27; of Stendhal&#x27;s &#x27;superior mind&#x27; by means of a number of subtle but quite concrete choices on Howard&#x27;s part, not least of which is his rendering of French verbs more crisply and colloquially than has been done before.&quot;. The translator&#x27;s notes in John Sturrock&#x27;s translation (Penguin, 2006), while echoing Mendelsohn on a personal level, found &quot;precedent in the end to be too strong&quot; as &quot;previous translators ... seem all of them to have settled on Fabrizio, and I have done the same&quot; (pp. xxv-xxvi).

==Literary significance==
While in some respects it is a &quot;romantic thriller&quot;, interwoven with intrigue and adventures, the novel is also an exploration of human nature, psychology, and court politics.

The novel is cited as an early example of realism, a stark contrast to the Romantic style popular while Stendhal was writing. It is considered by many authors to be a truly revolutionary work; Honoré de Balzac considered it the most significant novel of his time, Tolstoy was heavily influenced by Stendhal&#x27;s treatment of the Battle of Waterloo in his depiction of the Battle of Borodino, forming a central part of his novel&quot; War and Peace&quot;. André Gide described it as the greatest of all French novels, while Henry James ranked it &quot;among the dozen finest novels we possess&quot;.

==Criticism==
Stendhal wrote the book in just 52 days (from November 4, 1838, to December 26 of the same year). As a result, there are some poorly introduced plot elements (such as the poet-bandit-assassin Ferrante who suddenly appears in the story; even the author admits that he should have mentioned Ferrante&#x27;s relationship to Gina earlier in the story).

==Adaptations==
* An opera on the subject, with libretto by Armand Lunel and music by Henri Sauguet, was premiered in Paris in 1939.
* The novel was filmed in 1948, directed by Christian-Jaque and starring Gérard Philipe as Fabricio, Maria Casares as Gina Sanseverina, and Renée Faure as Clelia Conti.
* Bernardo Bertolucci claimed to have based his 1964 film &quot;Prima della rivoluzione&quot; (&quot;Before the Revolution&quot;) on the novel.
* In 1981, the novel was turned into a TV series, &quot;, directed by Mauro Bolognini, an Italian-French-German co-production.
* In 2012, a joint Italian-French TV miniseries &quot; was directed by Cinzia Th. Torrini.

<doc id="883100" wikidata="Q471313" url="?curid=883100" title="Hernán Siles Zuazo">
<text>Hernán Siles Zuazo (21 March 1914 – 6 August 1996) was a Bolivian politician who served as the 46th president of Bolivia twice nonconsecutively from 1956 to 1960 and from 1982 to 1985. He also briefly served as interim president in April 1952, and as the 27th vice president of Bolivia from 1952 to 1956.

==Early life==
Hernán Siles was the illegitimate son of the last Republican Party president of Bolivia, Hernando Siles Reyes and Isabel Zuazo Cusicanqui. Siles was raised by his mother. His half-brother Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas was president for five months in 1969.

In 1931 Siles graduated from the American Institute in La Paz. He served in Bolivian army and was decorated for injury sustained while fighting in the Chaco War of 1932–35. After the war he finished San Andres University with a degree in law.

Siles was married to Maria Teresa Ormachea del Carpio and had three daughters, Marcela, Ana Maria and Isabel.

==Formation of the MNR and the 1952 Revolution==

In 1940 Siles was elected in the Chamber of Deputies. Gravitating toward the reformist side of the political spectrum (even though his father had been one of the pillars of the Old Regime), in 1941 he founded along with Víctor Paz Estenssoro and others, the influential Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, or MNR).

The MNR was behind the coup that installed the progressive military administration of Gualberto Villarroel (1943–46), but was forced from power due to U.S. pressure and also by Villarroel&#x27;s overthrow in 1946 after which Siles was exiled to Argentina. There he worked as a correspondent for Associated Press from November 1947 until September 1948. In 1949, Siles returns to Bolivia to stand for election to the Bolivian legislature, which he wins. However, he is soon arrested for continuing agitation against the government in power and sent to the island prison of Isla de la Luna (Coati) on lake Titicaca. In September 1949, he escapes from the island prison together with a number of fellow political prisoners and, with Bolivian police in hot pursuit, is able to reach Peru, where he is granted political asylum. In October 9, 1949, he returns clandestinely to Bolivia and appears in the Bolivian congress at his assigned bench demanding his back pay--this public relations coup cements his image as a leader of the resistance against a tyrannical government. 

In the 1951 elections Paz Estenssoro run for presidency with Siles as his vice-presidential running mate, and won the contest with 42.9% of the vote. However, the ultra-conservative government of Mamerto Urriolagoitía refused to recognize the results and instead turned over the presidency to the commander of the Bolivian army, general Hugo Ballivián. At that point the MNR party went underground and on 9–11 April 1952 led the historic Bolivian National Revolution, aided by defections from the armed forces to the rebel cause (key among which was general Antonio Seleme). Siles played a major role in the revolutionary uprising, along with Juan Lechín, since the MNR leader Paz Estenssoro was at the time in exile in Argentina.

== Vice President (1952–1956) ==
Having defeated the military and toppled the Ballivián government, Siles served as provisional president from 11 April 1952 until 16 April 1952, when Estenssoro returned from exile. The 1951 electoral results were upheld, and Paz Estenssoro became constitutional president of Bolivia with Siles as his vice-president.

During the MNR&#x27;s first 4 years in the office, the government instituted far-reaching reforms, including the establishment of the universal vote, nationalization of the largest mining concerns in the country, and the adoption of a major agrarian reform. In 1956 Estenssoro left the office, as the Bolivian Constitution forbade a sitting president from running for another consecutive term. Siles, his logical successor, easily won the elections of 1956 and became President of the Republic on 6 August 1956.

== First presidency (1956–1960) ==

The first Siles&#x27; administration was more contentious and difficult than revolutionary Estenssoro&#x27;s had been. During this time MNR began to fragment along personal lines and due to growing disagreements over policy.

The economy was in deep trouble, as food and mineral production had plummeted; consequently, inflation soared, and the United States conditioned any further aid and support on the adoption of an economic program of its own prescription (the so-called &quot;Eder plan&quot;) in late 1956. Siles accepted these conditions, receiving North American aid in return for cutting government expenses and social programs.

Siles also had to tackle the difficult issue of disarming the worker and miner militia members who had fought in the 1952 Revolution and who had been allowed to keep their weapons. They had served as a useful counterbalance to the possibility of a conservative or military coup against the Revolution, but were by now serving the growing ambitions of the head of the Bolivian Workers&#x27; Center (COB) Juan Lechín. Meanwhile, the Falange Socialista Boliviana party schemed to topple the MNR from power, causing a rather disproportionate repressive backlash that diminished MNR&#x27;s (and Siles&#x27;) popularity.

== Break with the MNR and exile (1960–1978) ==
After the end of Siles&#x27; term in 1960, Estenssoro again ran for president in 1960 elections and, upon being elected, sent Siles as ambassador to Uruguay until 1963 and as ambassador to Spain (1963–64). In 1964 Siles broke with Estrassoro over the latter&#x27;s decision to run for another consecutive term.

Siles initially supported the November 1964 coup d&#x27;état by vice-president, General René Barrientos and army chief Alfredo Ovando — but was later exiled when it became apparent that the military intended to manipulate 1966 electoral results to perpetuate itself in power. Except for a five-month interlude during which his half-brother held the presidency, the armed forces remained in control of the Presidential Palacio Quemado until 1982.

In 1971 Siles opposed the right-wing coup of general Hugo Banzer, prompting an irreversible break with Estenssoro, who supported the coup. In 1971 Siles formed the Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (&quot;Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario de Izquierda&quot;, MNRI), beginning a steady leftwards drift.

== The 1978–1982 democratic false starts ==
After the 1978 democratic opening, Siles returned to Bolivia and formed a grand alliance of the left with the Revolutionary Left Movement, the Communist Party, and others. Together, they formed the Democratic and Popular Union (UDP), which triumphed in the 1978, 1979, and 1980 general elections, mostly as a result of a serious erosion of support for Estenssoro.

The 1978 election was annulled due to massive fraud in favor of the official military candidate, General Juan Pereda, though exit polls showed Siles would have won handily had the election been conducted honestly. The 1979 contest remained inconclusive because no candidate received 50% of the vote, and Congress elected Wálter Guevara a temporary president.

Siles finished first in 1980, but came up short of a majority. Days before Congress was due to convene to choose a winner, the army launched the bloody coup of 17 July 1980, which installed a reactionary (and cocaine-tainted) dictatorship of General Luis García Meza. Siles escaped to exile in Peru by crossing Lake Titicaca on a boat. He returned in 1982, when the military&#x27;s experiment had run its course and the Bolivian economy was on the verge of collapse.

== Second presidency (1982–1985) ==
With its reputation badly damaged by the excesses of the 1980–82 dictatorship, the military faced two options—call new elections, or accept the 1980 results. By this time, however, it was obvious that the country would crumble into civil war before new elections could be held. Under the circumstances, the military announced in September 1982 that to spare the expense of new elections and avoid further unrest, it would reconvene the legislature elected in 1980 and accept whomever it chose as president. Congress reconvened on 23 September and reconfirmed the 1980 election results. On 5 October, it overwhelmingly elected Siles as president. He was sworn into his second term on 10 October, with the MIR&#x27;s Jaime Paz as his vice-president.

In 1983, Siles Zuazo reopened relations with Cuba after the relationship ended twenty years previous. Cuban doctors began reorganizing the Bolivian health system.

On 30 June 1984 he was abducted from his home and held for ten hours during a failed military coup. 60 members of the army and police force sought to bring about a coup. According to the Bolivian government, members of the elite narcotics unit, the Leopardos, were involved in the abduction. The commanding officer of the unit was arrested.

The economic situation was dire, with growing hyperinflation. Siles had great difficulty in controlling the situation, and received scant support from the political parties or members of Congress, most of whom were eager to flex their political muscles after so many years of military authoritarianism. The unions, led by their old leader Juan Lechín, paralyzed the government with constant strikes, and even the vice-president, Jaime Paz, deserted the sinking ship when Siles&#x27; popularity sank to an all-time low.

The 1982–86 hyperinflation would end up being the fourth largest ever recorded in the world. Still, Siles refused to adopt extra-constitutional measures, preferring instead to consolidate the hard-earned Bolivian democracy regardless of the personal cost to him. He even went on a hunger strike as a desperate way to gain public sympathy. Finally, he agreed to shorten his own term and Congress moved the presidential election forward by a year.

One bright point in the Siles administration was the 1983 extradition to France of the Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, known as the Butcher of Lyon. He had been living in Bolivia since the late 1950s or early 1960s, after being smuggled out of Europe with the assistance of the United States, and was often employed by the 1964–82 dictatorships as an interrogation specialist. Following his extradition he was condemned for his crimes and died in a French prison.

==Later life==
By 1985 the government&#x27;s impotence prompted Congress to call early elections, citing the fact that Siles had been originally elected five long years before. His old rival, MNR&#x27;s Víctor Paz Estenssoro was elected president, and Siles left for Uruguay, a country where he had lived before in exile and for which he held special affection. He died in Montevideo, Uruguay in August 1996 at the age of 82.

<text>Andrey Petrovich Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky () (9 June 1866 – 8 April 1942) was a Russian entomologist specializing in beetles. He was the son of Pyotr Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky. He was among the first entomologists to consider the protection of insects and the risk of their extinction.
Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky was the son of the famous explorer Pyotr Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky and was born in St. Petersburg where he graduated from the 8th St. Petersburg gymnasium in 1885. At home he was trained in music and illustration. He could also speak Latin. He then joined the St. Petersburg University. Apart from his father, he was influenced by N. A. Severtsov and the entomologist August Feodorovitsh Morawitz (1837–1897). In 1888 and 1889 he traveled to the Trans-Caspian and Turkestan regions in search of insects, then in 1890 became a curator of entomology at the Imperial Academy of Sciences. He worked at the museum only until 1896 and then worked at his home. He studied mainly the Hymenoptera and Dermaptera. Citations of this author most frequently bear the Germanized spelling Semenov-Tian-Shanskij (e.g. ). He also took an interest in the poetry of Pushkin, the protection of nature, and a range of other subjects. He lost his vision at the age of 55 but continued to work, making use of his memory and assistants to help describe species, which he then transcribed. He died from pneumonia during the siege of Leningrad and his death date is uncertain, noted as 7 March or 8 April according to sources.

<text>Andrei Vladimirovich Semenov (, also sometimes transliterated as Andrei Semyonov; born June 17, 1977) is a Russian mixed martial artist and Sambo practitioner. He has also made forays into acting.

Semenov has fought within the UFC middleweight division, in M-1 events and Pride Bushido, with an overall MMA record of 34 wins, 9 losses and 2 draws. He has been fighting in Mixed Martial Arts since 1998, and is famed for excellent throws, strong submission defense, superior stamina and being very resilient and hard to finish.

==Mixed martial arts career==

===M-1 Global===
Three years after retiring in 2008, Semenov returned to MMA and fought Luigi Fioravanti at M-1 Challenge: 25 on April 28, 2011. Though a considerable underdog on media scoring websites, Semenov won the fight via unanimous decision. After another hiatus, Semenov returned on December 8, 2012, facing Michele Verginelli at M-1 Challenge: 36. He won via unanimous decision.

Semenov fought on October 20, 2013, defeating Gregor Herb at M-1 Challenge 42. He was then scheduled to face Ramazan Emeev at M-1 Challenge 47 on April 4, 2014, however in the weeks leading up to the event, the bout was cancelled for unknown reasons.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
With a 20-2 record, Semenov made his UFC debut on January 11, 2002, against notable BJJ black-belt Ricardo Almeida at UFC 35. Semenov won via TKO (punches).

He returned four months later on May 10, 2002, facing Ivan Salaverry at UFC 37. Semenov lost via TKO, and following the fight, Semenov left the UFC and returned to the M-1 Global promotion.

<text>The lesser roadrunner (Geococcyx velox) is a large, long-legged bird that is a member of the cuckoo family, Cuculidae. It is found in Mesoamerica. Its Latin name means &quot;swift earth-cuckoo&quot;. Along with the greater roadrunner, it is one of two species in the genus &quot;Geococcyx&quot;.

== Description ==

The lesser roadrunner is a slender bird that reaches a length of 46 to 51 cm (18 in), the tail itself accounting for about . Its average length is . The male weighs , while the female weighs .

The crown, crest and neck of the lesser roadrunner are black with a bronze glow and small light brown spots. The back neck is black-brown, with feathers are lined with a pale brown, so that a brown-white dashes arises. The plumage of the upper body is dark brown with light speckles and lightens to maroon towards the rump, and its breast is white. The rectrices are black with a dark purple luster. Young roadrunners resemble adults, but have ocher-colored lines, and duller skin around the eye.

The iris is yellow to brown, with a yellow to silvery-white ring surrounding the pupil. The eye ring is pale lavender to bright blue. The area behind the eye extends to a narrow band that turns into a bright red color on the neck, which is mostly covered by feathers. The upper beak is gray, while the lower beak is bluish-gray.

The lesser roadrunner resembles the greater roadrunner (&quot;Geococcyx californianus&quot;) in appearance and habit but is smaller, with a less streaked throat and chest, brownish on the rump and on the outer wings and yellowish undersides. The lesser roadrunner also has a significantly shorter bill.

== Habitat ==
The lesser roadrunner occurs in arid lowlands of Mesoamerica up to in altitude. It inhabits open ground areas, with scrub and thorny bushes. They can be found in higher elevations of stratovolcanoes such as Conchagua, San Miguel, Santa Ana and San Salvador, in semi-open areas above the treeline. They also adapt to cultivated land such as henequen and corn fields.

Its breeding range is in southwestern Mexico, north into the western side of the Sierra Madre Occidental range, along with northern Central America and a disjunct range in the northern Yucatán Peninsula. It overlaps with the range of the greater roadrunner in a small area in the states of Sonora, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and Michoacán.

== Behavior==

The lesser roadrunner can run up to . It spends most of its time on the ground, running in open areas, along roads or under cover. and is capable of limited flight, perching in bushes or low trees.

Roadrunners bask in the early morning, on a fence post or bush. They cock their tail and droop their wings, then turn their back towards the sun, raising the scapular feathers and exposing their black skin which absorbs heat. They may preen themselves as well.

The bird&#x27;s call is a series of soft &quot;cooing&quot;, about one note per second, made three to seven times on a descending scale.

=== Diet ===
The lesser roadrunner is an opportunistic feeder, which eats seeds, fruit, small reptiles and frogs. It forages around roadsides for large insects and roadkill. Grasshoppers make up a significant portion part of its diet, as do caterpillars.

===Nesting ===

Breeding is reported from Mexico between April and July, and in El Salvador in August.

The lesser roadrunner builds its nest in a low tree, a thorn bush or an &quot;Opuntia&quot; cactus, about off the ground. Its eggs, which are white and in length, are laid in clutches of 2 to 4. Their nests are smaller than those of the greater roadrunner, but are stronger and more compact, built in the shape of a cup with sturdy grass stems and twigs, with a diameter of . Both male and female roadrunners incubate.

Lesser roadrunner clutches show less variation in size than those of the greater roadrunner, and from observation, all eggs appear to hatch around the same time.

<text>Janelle Patton was a 29-year-old Sydney woman who was murdered on Norfolk Island on 31 March 2002. The case made national headlines in Australia and New Zealand, as she was the first person to be murdered on Norfolk Island since 1893.

==Background and murder==
Patton had initially relocated from Sydney, New South Wales, to Norfolk Island, an Australian territory to the northwest of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, in her late twenties; the move came after feeling dissatisfied and depressed with the state of her life on the mainland. Patton had stated to various friends and family that she simply wanted to &quot;get away&quot; from the chaos of life in a big city. In addition to personal and work prospects, the young lady was seeking a fresh start in her love life after a number of failed and tumultuous relationships in Sydney. One abusive ex-boyfriend had broken her jaw. With her sights set on Norfolk Island, Patton took a brief trip to the territory and secured a position working at one of the island&#x27;s hotels, and an apartment.

It was later stated by Patton&#x27;s family and friends on the island that she continued to be disappointed in the men she was seeing there. Allegedly, and whether she was aware of it or not, Patton had been dating at least one man who was already in a relationship; in a tense confrontation with an angry girlfriend, a woman reportedly slapped Patton across the face. At the time of her murder, Janelle was looking forward to a visit from her parents. Her parents&#x27; flight arrived from mainland Australia just one day before her murder; they stayed at a nearby hotel while Patton stayed at her apartment. It is unclear why her parents did not stay with their daughter. 

Patton planned to take her parents to lunch the next day, after her morning hotel shift, saying she would stop by to pick them up by 1:00. The time came and went but she failed to show and did not contact anyone. Patton was last seen going on her morning walk before work along a coastal track near her home. She also appeared on CCTV from a grocery store. Her parents began searching that afternoon, bumping into one of her colleagues and, eventually, her landlady; neither had seen Patton since that morning. Later that evening, her parents decided to report her missing at the police station.

Soon after the Pattons reported their daughter missing, a woman&#x27;s body matching Janelle&#x27;s general description was discovered by two tourists from New Zealand. The body was discovered at Cockpit Waterfall Reserve, at the opposite end of the island from where Patton was last seen, wrapped in a large black plastic sheet. Janelle&#x27;s identity was confirmed by her landlady, who wanted to spare her parents the sight of the body. 

It was believed by medical examiners that Patton had fought against her attacker, as her body bore several defensive wounds, primarily to her hands. She apparently managed to grab onto the blade of the killer&#x27;s knife in an attempt to stop the prolonged attack, her thumb nearly being severed. Various shards of broken glass, plastic, and sand were found in her hair and her body was covered in bruises, leading examiners to believe she was struck with a glass bottle or a metallic pole, or something similar. Patton had endured a long attack, suffering a broken pelvis and ankle as well as a fractured skull — the result of being stabbed with great force through her eyeball. She was also stabbed over 65 times. The ultimate cause of death was a stab wound to the chest that punctured her lung.

==Arrest==
The investigation into Patton&#x27;s murder was protracted and difficult, although the main forensics were Patton&#x27;s defensive wounds, the black sheet she was wrapped in, and pieces of green glass in her hair. Eventually, on 1 February 2006, Glenn Peter Charles McNeill, a 28-year-old chef from New Zealand, was arrested for her murder near the city of Nelson, on the South Island of New Zealand, after being identified by an Australian Federal Police investigation. He was subsequently extradited to Norfolk Island and formally charged with the crime. At the Norfolk Island Court of Petty Sessions McNeill claimed he had smoked marijuana that day and that he had accidentally run over Patton with his car, a statement he later retracted. He was transferred to Silverwater Correctional Centre in Sydney.

==Trial==
On 1 February 2007, McNeill formally went on trial for the murder. A press blackout was imposed by the judge, Chief Justice Mark Weinberg, to prevent any dilution of the limited potential jury pool in Norfolk Island. On 1 March 2007, McNeill told the Supreme Court, &quot;I did not kill Janelle Patton&quot;, &quot;I did not abduct her&quot; and &quot;I did not see Janelle Patton that day&quot;. He said he could not recall what he had told police earlier, but &quot;would have admitted to anything&quot; due to his mental health problems. The trial ended on 9 March 2007 when the 11-person jury returned a guilty verdict, although the question of motive and an explanation for unidentified female DNA found on the body remained unclear. On 25 July 2007, McNeill was sentenced to 24 years in prison by Chief Justice Weinberg in the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island sitting in Sydney.

==Appeals==
McNeill appealed his conviction to a Full Court of the Federal Court on grounds that included that his statement to the police should not have been admitted as evidence against him. The Full Court, Chief Justice Black, and Justices Lander and Besanko, dismissed his appeal. The High Court of Australia refused special leave to appeal on 14 November 2008.

==Release==
McNeill was released on 31 January 2024 and immediately deported to New Zealand.

<text>Muliufi Francis Hannemann (born July 16, 1954) is an American politician, businessman, and non-profit executive. He was elected twice as Mayor of Honolulu in 2004 and 2008. Hannemann has served as a special assistant in Washington, D.C., with the Department of the Interior, where he was selected for a White House fellowship in the Reagan administration under Vice President George H. W. Bush. He also served as chairman of the Honolulu City Council. He is the first person of Samoan descent and the second member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to serve as Mayor of Honolulu (Neal Blaisdell was the first).

== Early life, education, and academic career ==
Muliufi Francis Hannemann was raised in the Honolulu community of Kalihi by his German-Samoan father, Gustav Arthur Tafu Tupulo Hannemann III, and Samoan mother, Faiaso Soli&#x27;ai, whose grandfather High Chief Muliufi Soliai was one of the original signatories to the deed of cession that transformed Eastern Samoa and the Manua Islands into the US Territory of American Samoa. He attended Fern, Puʻuhale and Kalihi Kai elementary schools up to the seventh grade before being accepted to the ʻIolani School with a scholarship. He graduated with honors and competed in basketball and American football. In the fall of 1972, Hannemann left the Hawaiian Islands to attend Harvard College where he was elected freshman class president and was varsity basketball letterman. Upon graduation from Harvard in 1976, Hannemann continued his studies as a Fulbright Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. He returned to Honolulu after his studies to become an educator at his alma mater, Iolani School. He was a history teacher and basketball coach.

==Business career==
In 1981, he took on advisory role on the board of the Schutter Foundation, a not-for-profit civil rights advocacy group started by Hawaii criminal defense attorney David Schutter.
From 1984–1991 his business career was with C. Brewer &amp; Co., at one time one of Hawaii&#x27;s oldest agri-businesses. At Brewer, he was Vice-President of Corporate Development, Marketing and Public Affairs. He is also the Principal and Founder of MFH Enterprises, a professional consulting firm that does business in Hawaii, the mainland US and the Pacific Rim. In July 2015, he returned to his former position in Hawaii&#x27;s number one industry, tourism, as the CEO and President of the Hawaii Lodging and Tourism Association. HLTA is the state&#x27;s largest private visitor industry organization and he previously served as the organization&#x27;s leader from 2010–2011.

== Political career ==

===1970s===

====Carter administration====
After his teaching career, Hannemann entered government service as a special assistant to President Jimmy Carter, working with the United States Department of the Interior.

====Ariyoshi administration====
Hannemann was appointed by Governor of Hawaii George Ariyoshi as a special assistant.

===1980s===

====1986 congressional election====
In 1986, Hannemann ran for the First District in the U.S. House that was being vacated by Cecil Heftel, who sought the governorship that year. Hannemann won the Democratic primary election but lost the special election to fill Heftel&#x27;s unexpired term to Neil Abercrombie. He again lost in the general election to Republican candidate Pat Saiki.

====Bush administration====
He then served as staff assistant to Vice President George H. W. Bush.

===1990s===

====1990 congressional election====
In 1990, he ran for Congress again, this time for the Second District seat vacated by Daniel Akaka, who was eventually elected to the U.S. Senate. He lost the Democratic primary to Patsy Mink, who eventually won the seat.

====Waihee administration====
Hannemann would again be tapped for government service in 1991, appointed by Governor John D. Waiheʻe III as Chairman of the Hawaii Pro Bowl Host Committee, Chairman of the Task Force on Homeporting, Director of the Hawaii Office of International Relations and Director of the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.

====Clinton administration====
Having directed various state agencies of the Government of Hawaii, Hannemann was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve at the federal level once again as United States Representative to the South Pacific Commission.

====Honolulu City Council====
In 1994, Hannemann was elected to the Honolulu City Council representing Aiea and Pearl City, and in 1996 he founded the Pacific Century Fellows Program modeled after the White House Fellows Program. He was re-elected to his seat in 1998. He served as Council Chairman from 1998 to 1999. Differences in opinion with then-Mayor Jeremy Harris led to his resignation from the Council in 2000 to run against Harris. Harris won re-election in the September 2000 non-partisan election with enough votes to avoid a run-off that November.

===2000s===

====Bush administration====
In the administration of President George W. Bush, Hannemann served in the United States Department of Labor as a member of the President&#x27;s Council on the 21st Century Workforce.

==== Mayor of Honolulu ====
In 2004 Hannemann again ran for Mayor, this time to replace Harris, who was unable to seek a third full term as Mayor due to term limits. His opponent was former City Council colleague Duke Bainum. The race was considered one of the fiercest and most expensive in the city&#x27;s history, with both candidates sharply criticizing the other&#x27;s stands and character. Bainum received the most votes in the September election, but failed to receive the necessary majority to avoid a run-off against Hannemann. In November, Hannemann narrowly won the election with a margin of about 1,300 votes out of nearly 300,000 cast.

Hannemann was sworn in as mayor on January 2, 2005. In his first State of the City address, Hannemann pledged to concentrate on fiscal restraint and basic city services, claiming a contrast between himself and his predecessor. One of his major accomplishments as mayor was overseeing the planning for the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project, which will provide a rail transit system for Honolulu. The project eventually became a major issue when Hannemann came up for reelection in 2008, with his odds of success tied to public perception of it.

He is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. He served as the Chair of the Tourism, Arts, Parks, Entertainment, and Sports Committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Hannemann was longlisted for the 2008 World Mayor award.

In 2009, Hannemann was sworn into his second term as mayor of Honolulu by Bode Uale.

===2010s===

==== 2010 gubernatorial election ====

On July 20, 2010, Hannemann resigned his position as mayor to compete in the 2010 Hawaii gubernatorial election. City Managing Director Kirk Caldwell assumed the position of interim mayor until a special election was held to determine a permanent replacement. On September 18, 2010, Hannemann lost the Democratic primary to Neil Abercrombie by approximately twenty-one percentage points.

==== 2012 congressional election ====

Hannemann announced his intention to run for Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd Congressional district seat on August 30, 2011. The incumbent, Mazie Hirono, vacated the seat to run for the U.S. Senate seat then held by Daniel Akaka, who did not seek reelection in 2012. He lost the primary election to Tulsi Gabbard on August 11, 2012, by approximately twenty percentage points.

==== 2014 gubernatorial election ====

After considering a run for Republican nomination, Hannemann was an independent candidate for Governor, finishing third out of four candidates in the general election with 11.6% of the vote.

===2020s===

====2020 Honolulu mayoral election====
On May 31, 2020, Mufi Hannemann announced that he would be filing nomination papers to run for Honolulu Mayor again. On August 8, Hannemann conceded after finishing fifth in a field of 15 with only 9.92% of the primary vote.

== Personal life ==
Hannemann stands in height. His brother Nephi Hannemann was a Polynesian actor and singer. His cousin, Jacob Hannemann, is a former Major League Baseball player.

<text>Chicken fight, also known as shoulder wars, is an informal game, often played in a lake or swimming pool, characterized by one team member sitting on the shoulders of their teammate or riding piggy-back. The object of the game is to knock down or separate an opposing team through team effort. The person on top is considered to be the &quot;attacker&quot; while the person below is considered to be the &quot;vehicle&quot;. The person below may not use arms or hands and must rely on momentum to attack by running into the other team. The person on his/her shoulders is the &quot;attacker&quot; and may use any means possible of separating the other team or knocking them to the ground. If a team is separated or knocked down in any way, they are required to resign from the game and the last team to remain together is considered the winner. It is not uncommon for this game to be banned in swimming pools due to safety concerns.

A similar Japanese game called is commonly played as part of an annual sports day event at elementary and junior high schools. It is a field event rather than a swimming event. In it, a team of four competitors work together, with three carrying the fourth, who wears a bandana (hachimaki) or hat. The team is defeated if they are knocked over or, more commonly, if their bandana/hat is removed by an opponent. Competitors are often divided into opposing red and white factions. In recent years some schools have removed physically demanding events such as the &quot;kibasen&quot; from sports day programs due to the risk of serious injury. In a 2003 incident a high school student in Fukuoka Prefecture was left quadriplegic after falling from his teammates&#x27; shoulders.

<text>In particle physics, a massless particle is an elementary particle whose invariant mass is zero. At present the only confirmed massless particle is the photon.

==Other particles and quasiparticles==

===Standard Model gauge bosons===
The photon (carrier of electromagnetism) is one of two known gauge bosons that are both believed to be massless; the other is the gluon (carrier of the strong force). The only other confirmed gauge bosons are the W and Z bosons, which are known from experiment to be extremely massive. 

Although there are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that gluons are massless, they can never be observed as free particles due to being confined within hadrons, and hence their presumed lack of rest mass cannot be confirmed by any feasible experiment.

=== Hypothetical graviton ===
The graviton is a hypothetical tensor boson proposed to be the carrier of gravitational force in some quantum theories of gravity, but no such theory has been successfully incorporated into the Standard Model, so the Standard Model neither predicts any such particle nor requires it, and no gravitational quantum particle has been indicated by experiment. Whether a graviton would be massless if it existed is likewise an open question.

=== Quasiparticles ===
The Weyl fermion discovered in 2015 is also expected to be massless, but these are not actual particles. At one time neutrinos were thought to perhaps be Weyl fermions, but when they were discovered to have mass, that left no fundamental particles of the Weyl type.

The Weyl fermions discovered in 2015 are merely &quot;quasiparticles&quot; – composite motions found in the structure of molecular latices that have particle-like behavior, but are not themselves real particles. Weyl fermions in matter are like phonons, which are also quasiparticles. No real particle that is a Weyl fermion has been found to exist, and there is no compelling theoretical reason that requires them to exist. 

Neutrinos were originally thought to be massless – and possibly. However, because neutrinos change flavour as they travel, at least two of the types of neutrinos must have mass (and cannot be Weyl fermions). The discovery of this phenomenon, known as neutrino oscillation, led to Canadian scientist Arthur B. McDonald and Japanese scientist Takaaki Kajita sharing the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics.

<doc id="883203" wikidata="Q421129" url="?curid=883203" title="Bromophenol blue">
<text>Bromophenol blue (3′,3″,5′,5″-tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein, BPB), albutest is used as a pH indicator, an electrophoretic color marker, and a dye. It can be prepared by slowly adding excess bromine to a hot solution of phenolsulfonphthalein in glacial acetic acid.

==Acid–base indicator==

As an acid–base indicator, its useful range lies between pH 3.0 and 4.6. It changes from yellow at pH 3.0 to blue at pH 4.6; this reaction is reversible. Bromophenol blue is structurally related to phenolphthalein (a popular indicator).

==Color marker==
Bromophenol is also used as a colour marker to monitor the process of agarose gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since bromophenol blue carries a slight negative charge at moderate pH, it will migrate in the same direction as DNA or protein in a gel; the rate at which it migrates varies according to gel density and buffer composition, but in a typical 1% agarose gel in a 1X TAE buffer or TBE buffer, bromophenol blue migrates at the same rate as a DNA fragment of about 300 base pairs, in 2% agarose as 150 bp. Xylene cyanol and orange G may also be used for this purpose.

==Dye==
Bromophenol blue is also used as a dye. At neutral pH, the dye absorbs red light most strongly and transmits blue light. (Its peak absorbance is 590 nm at a basic pH of 12.) Solutions of the dye, therefore, are blue. At low pH, the dye absorbs ultraviolet and blue light most strongly and appears yellow in solution. 
In solution at pH 3.6 (in the middle of the transition range of this pH indicator) obtained by dissolution in water without any pH adjustment, bromophenol blue has a characteristic green red colour, where the apparent colour shifts depending on the concentration and/or path length through which the solution is observed. This phenomenon is called dichromatic color. Bromophenol blue is the substance with the highest known value of Kreft&#x27;s dichromaticity index. This means it has the largest change in colour hue, when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases.

<doc id="883216" wikidata="Q904867" url="?curid=883216" title="List of German combat vehicles of World War II">
<text>The German Wehrmacht used an extensive variety of combat vehicles during World War II.
==Tanks==
===Leichttraktor===
The VK.31 &quot;Leichttraktor&quot; (&quot;Light tractor&quot;) was an experimental German light fighting tank developed in the 1920s under secret conditions. Only four were produced and they were used in the late 1930s and the early part of the war for training purposes.

===Panzerkampfwagen I (PzKpfw I)===
The Panzer I (Sd. Kfz. 101) was not intended as a combat vehicle but rather to familiarise industry and the army with tanks. By the time production ended in 1937, 1,869 Panzer I hulls had been produced, of which 1493 were fitted with turrets. The rest were used as command or training vehicles.

Variants and vehicles using hull:
* Panzerjäger I, a Czech 4.7 cm KPÚV vz. 38 anti-tank gun on Panzer I Ausf.B chassis
* Sturmpanzer I Bison, the 15 cm sIG 33 heavy infantry support gun on a Panzer I Ausf.B chassis
* Flakpanzer I, a 2cm Flak 38 anti-aircraft cannon on Panzer I Ausf.A chassis
* &quot;kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen&quot;, an armoured command vehicle on Panzer I Ausf.B chassis

===Panzerkampfwagen II (PzKpfw II)===

The Panzer II (Sd. Kfz. 121) was a light tank designed to replace the Panzer I. It was armed with a 20 mm cannon, which had some capability against other armoured vehicles. Before the war started, 1,223 had been built.

Variants:
;PzKpfw II Flamm, (Sd. Kfz. 122), &quot;Flamingo&quot;:flamethrower tank (Ausfuhrung A and B)
;Luchs: Light reconnaissance tank
;Marder II: 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun on Panzer II chassis (Sd. Kfz. 131)
;Marder II:captured Russian 76.2 mm anti-tank gun on Panzer II Ausf. D/E chassis (Sd. Kfz. 132)
;Wespe:105 mm light field howitzer on Panzer II chassis (Sd. Kfz. 124)

===Panzer 35(t)===
In March 1939, Germany occupied and annexed the Bohemia and Moravia region of Czechoslovakia taking over the Czech arms manufacturing industries. The Czech LT-35 tank was given the German designation Panzer 35(t), with &quot;t&quot; standing for &quot;tschechisch&quot; (the German word for Czech).

===Panzer 38(t)===
Also known as: &quot;PzKpfw 38(t), Panzer 38(t), Sd. Kfz. 140&quot;&lt;br&gt;
In March 1939, Germany invaded Czech territory and took over the Czech arms manufacturing industries. The Czech LT-38 tank, then in production, was produced for German use as the Panzer 38(t) (&quot;t&quot; standing for &quot;tschechisch&quot;, German for Czech). By the start of the war, 78 Panzer 38(t) tanks had been produced.

Germany continued producing the Panzer 38(t) during the war. By early 1942, it was clearly obsolete. However, the production lines were already running, the vehicle was mechanically reliable, and the factory would have had difficulty moving over to larger tanks, so it was decided to find other uses for the Panzer 38(t) chassis for self-propelled guns.

Variants:
* Marder 138 (Marder III) = 75 mm Pak 40 gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd. Kfz. 138)
* Marder 139 (Marder III)= captured Russian 76.2 mm gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd. Kfz. 139)
* Grille = 150 mm heavy infantry gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd.Kfz. 138/1)
* Jagdpanzer 38 = 75 mm L/48 Pak39 gun on a widened Pz 38(t) chassis
*Flakpanzer 38(t) = 2cm FlaK self-propelled anti-aircraft gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd. Kfz. 140)

===Panzer III===
Also known as: &quot;PzKpfw III, &#x27;Panzer III&#x27;, Sd. Kfz. 141&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Panzer III was designed as a medium tank, with a high-velocity 37 mm gun. Pre-war production was 98 vehicles. During the war, the Pz III was upgunned to a 50 mm L/42 gun, then to an even higher velocity 50 mm L/60 gun, in order to improve its anti-tank performance. A low-velocity 75 mm gun was also fitted (using the same mount as the early Panzer IV), but since the tank was not large enough to fit a high-velocity 75 mm gun, production was halted mid-war, although the chassis continued to be used to build assault guns.

The Panzer III was the first tank to have a 3-man turret: the commander did not have to double up as a loader or a gunner, so he could concentrate on commanding the tank.

Variants:
* Panzer III A-F= armed with 37 mm L/45 gun
* Panzer III F-M = armed with 50 mm L/42 or L/60 gun
* Panzer III N = armed with 75 mm L/24 gun, used for Infantry support
* Panzer III (f) = armed with flamethrower
* Sturmgeschütz III = &quot;Sturmgeschütz 40&quot;= Assault Gun armed with 75 mm L/24 (A-E), later with L/43 (F) and L/48 gun (F8 &amp; G) (Sd. Kfz. 142)
* StuH 42 = Sturmhaubitze 42. StuG III with 105 mm light field howitzer (Sd. Kfz. 142/2)

===Panzer IV===
Also known as: &quot;PzKpfw IV, &#x27;Panzer IV&#x27;, Sd. Kfz. 161&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Panzer IV was designed alongside the Panzer III. The Panzer IV was a slightly larger and heavier tank, and with its large calibre low velocity gun, it was designed to support the Panzer III when it met heavy resistance from infantry support. Pre-war production was 211 tanks. Originally armed with a low-velocity 75 mm L/24 gun, in 1942 this was upgraded to a 75 mm L/43 gun, and 1943 to a 75 mm L/48 gun.

Variants:
* Panzer IV A-F1 = Panzer IV with 75 mm L/24 gun
* Panzer IV F2-J = Panzer IV with 75 mm L/43 or L/48 gun
* Sturmgeschütz IV = Assault Gun. Superstructure of Sturmgeschütz III on Panzer IV chassis; armed with 75 mm L/48 gun (Sd. Kfz. 167)
* Jagdpanzer IV = Tank Destroyer with 75 mm L/48, later L/70, gun on Panzer IV chassis (Sd. Kfz. 162)
* Sturmpanzer IV Brummbär with 150 mm field howitzer on Panzer IV chassis (Sd. Kfz. 166)
* Hummel = 150 mm field howitzer on Geschützwagen III/IV chassis (Sd. Kfz. 165)
* Hornisse = 88 mm Pak43/1 auf Geschützwagen III/IV, later known as Nashorn (Sd. Kfz. 164)
* Möbelwagen = Self-propelled anti-aircraft. 37 mm Flak 43 L/89 on Panzer IV chassis (Flakpanzer IV Sd. Kfz.161/3)
* Wirbelwind = Self-propelled anti-aircraft. Quadruple 20 mm Flak 38 L/112.5 guns on Panzer IV chassis, with armoured turret (Flakpanzer IV)
* Ostwind = Self-propelled anti-aircraft. 37 mm Flak 43 L/89 on Panzer IV chassis, with armoured turret (Flakpanzer IV)
* Kugelblitz = Self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. 30mm MK 103 twin anti-aircraft gun on Panzer IV chassis, with armoured turret (Flakpanzer IV)

===Panzerkampfwagen V &quot;Panther&quot;===

The Panther, also known as &quot;PzKpfw V&quot;, &quot;Panzer V&quot;, and &quot;Sd. Kfz. 171&quot;, was a medium tank of the German Army in the second part of World War II. Until 1944, it was designated as the PzKpfw V Panther.
The production Panther was a direct response to the Soviet T-34, after encountering difficulties fighting the T-34, Colonel General Heinz Guderian (the &quot;Inspector of Panzer Troops&quot;) suggested simply copying the T-34; although the report of the enquiry recommended that the main attributes of the T-34 - armament, sloped armor and suspension - be incorporated into a new German medium weight tank under the Vollketten 30 project. Two proposals - by Daimler-Benz and Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg (MAN) - were examined and the MAN design selected for production.

Variants:
* Panther &quot;Ausf&quot;. D - first production version, armed with 75 mm KwK 42 L/70 gun. 842 built
* Panther &quot;Ausf&quot;. A - second production version, improved Ausf. D, 2,200 built
* Panther &quot;Ausf&quot;. G - additional armour, approx 2,900 built
* Jagdpanther - a Jagdpanzer (tank destroyer) design with an 88 mm L/71 PaK 43 gun on Panzer V chassis (Sd. Kfz. 173)
* Panther &quot;Ausf&quot;. F - a Panther development with narrow front &quot;Schmalturm&quot; turret, none built
* Bergepanther = an armoured recovery vehicle, 339 built

===Panther II===
Panther II tank successor tank to the Panther while visually similar, was planned to use a new turret, longer 75mm gun, thicker armour, new engine and different components from the Tiger and Tiger II.
Only one chassis was built and was later fitted with an Ausf G turret

===Panzer VI Ausf. E &quot;Tiger&quot;===
Also known as: &quot;PzKpfw VI E, &#x27;Panzer VI E&#x27;, Tiger I, Sd. Kfz. 181&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Tiger I (Panzer VI Ausf.H, later renamed later Panzer VI Ausf.E ) was armed with an 88 mm L/56 gun. On May 26, 1941 Hitler ordered the Henschel and Porsche firms to design a new heavy tank to be delivered in 1942. Porsche used their existing VK 30.01 (P) Leopard design while Henschel based theirs on their earlier VK 36.01 (H). The Henschel design won the competition and became the &quot;Tiger&quot;. A few Porsche Tigers were made, with a different chassis and hybrid gasoline-electric powerplant, but these were not as reliable as the Henschel model. Many of the Porsche chassis were converted into tank destroyers, known as &quot;Ferdinand&quot; then rebuilt as &quot;Elefant&quot;

Variant:
*Sturmtiger was armed with a 380 mm rocket.

===Panzer VI Ausf. B &quot;Königstiger&quot;===
Also known as: &quot;PzKpfw VIB, &#x27;Panzer VIB&#x27;, Tiger II, King Tiger, Royal Tiger, Sd. Kfz. 182&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger II Ausf. B &quot;Königstiger&quot; (Sd. Kfz.182) / VK4503(H) was a heavy tank in the later half of World War II. Armed with an 88 mm L/71 gun, the vehicle could perform well in the defensive role on the eastern and western fronts but was an expensive failure for Nazi Germany when used in an offensive role as a main battle tank. The Tiger II combined one of the most capable AT guns of the period with heavy armour, but had an over-burdened engine and lacked reliability.

Variant:
*Jagdtiger was armed with a 128 mm L/55 Pak44 gun (Sd. Kfz. 186)

===Panzer VII &quot;Löwe&quot;===
Panzer VII Löwe was a proposed superheavy tank design. It never left the drawing board.

===Panzer VIII &quot;Maus&quot;===
Also known as: &quot;Panzer VIII&quot;, &#x27;Maus&#x27; &lt;br&gt; 
Panzer VIII Maus was a German 188t super heavy tank. Two prototypes were built and only one prototype got a turret.

==Self-propelled artillery==

*Wespe - 105 mm howitzer built on Panzer II chassis

*Grille - 150 mm heavy infantry gun built on Panzer 38(t) chassis, sometimes wrongly named &quot;Bison&quot;.

*Hummel - The Hummel was a self-propelled artillery piece fielding a 150 mm howitzer on a chassis that combined features of both the Panzer III and Panzer IV. 714 Hummels plus 150 Hummel ammunition carriers were built from 1943 to 1944.

*Heuschrecke - The Heuschrecke was a self-propelled artillery piece with a 10.5cm leFH 18/1 L/28 on a Panzer IV chassis. Production never started as it would have affected production of tanks.

==Self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery==

Several types of armored self-propelled anti-aircraft weapons (&quot;flakpanzers&quot; in German) were used in the war.

* Flakpanzer I, a converted version of the, Panzer I tank.
* Flakpanzer 38(t), based on the Panzer 38(t) light tank
* Flakpanzer IV, the general designation for a series of vehicles based on the Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tank chassis, including the:
** Möbelwagen
** Wirbelwind
** Ostwind
** Kugelblitz, in prototype stage at the end of World War II

==Assault guns==
An assault gun is an armoured fighting vehicle similar to a tank, but typically does not have a rotating turret, and may have an open roof. The removal of the turret allows for a much larger gun to be carried on a smaller chassis. They are not intended to fight other AFVs, but instead directly support infantry during assaults on prepared positions. However they were still often fitted with AT guns to destroy AFVs.

During World War II Germany built many more assault guns than tanks, because of their relative cheapness and simplicity.

;Elefant
:The &quot;Elefant&quot; (Sd. Kfz. 184) used the chassis of Porsche&#x27;s losing entry for the Tiger I competition. On top of this chassis, a forward-facing 88 mm L/71 gun was mounted. A total of 90 Elefants were produced, all in early 1943 and known then as the &quot;Ferdinand&quot;, after its designer, Dr Ferdinand Porsche. Those still in use in late 1943 were modified and renamed &quot;Elefant&quot;.

<doc id="883238" wikidata="Q308822" url="?curid=883238" title="Scottish Cup">
<text>The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the Scottish Cup (), is an annual association football knock-out cup competition for men&#x27;s football clubs in Scotland. The competition was first held in 1873–74. Entry is open to all 122 clubs with full membership of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), along with up to eight other clubs who are associate members. The competition is called [[British Gas|Scottish Gas]] Men&#x27;s Scottish Cup for sponsorship reasons.

Although it is the second-oldest competition in association football history, after the English FA Cup, the Scottish Cup trophy is the oldest in association football and is also the oldest national trophy in the world. It was first presented to Queen&#x27;s Park, who won the final match of the inaugural tournament in March 1874. The current holders are Celtic, who won the tournament for the 42nd time by defeating Rangers 1–0 in the 2024 final.

== Format ==
The tournament starts at the beginning of the Scottish football season, in August. The Scottish Cup Final is usually the last game of the season, taking place at the end of May. Participating teams enter the tournament at different stages depending on their league ranking. The lowest ranked clubs enter the tournament at the preliminary round whilst the highest ranked, those that compete in the Scottish Premiership, enter at the fourth round stage in January.

The competition is a knock-out tournament. In each round of games the teams are paired at random, with the first team drawn listed as the home team. Every game lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage time. The winner of each game advances to the next round, whilst the loser is eliminated from the tournament. In prior seasons, if a game ended in a draw before the fourth round, the fixture was replayed at the home ground of the other team at a later date, before the fourth round. If the replay also ended in a draw, a penalty shoot-out took place to decide the winner. From the fourth round onwards, if the game ended in a draw there was no replay; 30 minutes of extra time would be played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if there is still no winner. Following a vote by the Scottish FA&#x27;s member clubs in August 2022, it was decided that, for the 2022—23 competition, there would be no replays following the preliminary round, extra time and penalties will be used to decide the winner of drawn games from Round One onwards.

The competition has a staggered entry system. For the 2022–23 edition, the preliminary round is contested by 50 clubs. Eighteen Highland League and sixteen Lowland League clubs begin in the first round. Ten Scottish League Two clubs enter the second round. Scottish League One and Scottish Championship clubs start in the third round, while 12 Scottish Premiership clubs enter in the fourth round.

=== Eligible clubs and players ===
Any club that is a full or associate member of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) is entitled to compete in the tournament. Full members qualify automatically, which includes every team that plays in the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), Highland League, and Lowland League. Between 1895 and 2007, clubs that were SFA members but not competitors in the country&#x27;s professional football leagues could only qualify for the tournament through the Scottish Qualifying Cup.

Clubs which are not full members of the SFA may still qualify for the tournament by winning one of the six leagues at tier 6 in the Scottish football league system (East, Midlands, North Caledonian, North Region, South, West) or the East, South and West of Scotland Cup-Winners Shield. Clubs that are members of the Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) have been able to qualify since 2007 by winning the Scottish Junior Cup. And since 2015, the winners of the Scottish Amateur Cup are also eligible to qualify.

Players that are registered with a competing club are eligible to play, however, cannot represent more than one club during the same tournament. Each club names eleven players and up to seven substitutes before every match. In order to play in the final match, a player must have also been registered to compete in the semi-final round for the same club. If a club fields a player that is not registered, the club may be expelled from the tournament.

=== Venues ===
Before the semi-final and final rounds, the venue of each match is determined when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is named the home team and chooses the venue for the match, usually its own home ground. In the event of a game ending in a draw, the venue for the replay is the home ground of the second club drawn. The semi-final ties are played at a neutral venue; usually Hampden Park in Glasgow. On occasions when Hampden has been unavailable, such as when it was being renovated in the late 1990s and when it was being transformed into an athletics stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the semi-finals have been hosted at Celtic Park and Ibrox Stadium, also in Glasgow.
Hampden Park also usually hosts the final match of the tournament. The venue – across three sites in close proximity bearing the name – has hosted the majority of finals including the first in 1874. Other venues that have hosted the final in the tournament&#x27;s early years are Hamilton Crescent, Kinning Park and the first Cathkin Park; all in Glasgow (although just outside the city boundaries at the time). The last game of the 1896 tournament is the only final that has been hosted outside Glasgow when rivals Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian played at New Logie Green in Edinburgh. Hampden Park has held world and European records for the highest attendance, some of which were recorded at Scottish Cup games. The 1937 final played between Aberdeen and Celtic attracted a crowd of 147,365 spectators which was a world record for a national cup final and remains a European record.

=== European qualification ===
As Scotland is a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the winner of the Scottish Cup qualifies to compete in European-wide competitions organised by UEFA. Between 1960 and 1998, the Scottish Cup winners qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup along with winners of other domestic cup competitions across Europe before it was abolished. The Scottish Cup winners now qualify to compete in the following season&#x27;s UEFA Europa League (formerly known as the UEFA Cup). It is possible for the Scottish Cup winners to have already qualified for a UEFA competition through their league ranking in the Scottish Premiership. In this scenario, the qualification spot passes to the highest ranked team in that competition not yet qualified, rather than to the Scottish Cup runners-up. Until 2014, the Scottish Cup runners-up qualified for European competition if the cup winners had also qualified for the Champions League.

== History ==
The Scottish Football Association was founded in 1873 and the Scottish Cup was created as an annual competition for its members. The first Scottish Cup match took place on 18 October 1873 when Renton defeated Kilmarnock 2–0 in the first round. In its early years the competition was dominated by Queen&#x27;s Park who won the final 10 times in the first twenty years. Vale of Leven, Dumbarton and Renton were also successful during this period. In 1885, the record margin of victory in the tournament was recorded when Arbroath defeated Bon Accord 36–0 in a first round match. It was also the highest scoring professional football game recorded in history.

=== Trophy ===

The Scottish Cup trophy is the oldest national trophy and also the oldest association football trophy in the world. It was made by silversmith Martin Hall &amp; Co in London in 1873 and has been presented to the winners of the tournament since 1874. The solid silver trophy is in height and weighs . The original trophy is displayed at the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden Park. It is removed once each year to be cleaned and presented to the tournament winners. After the presentation ceremony, the trophy is returned to the museum. A replica of the original trophy is given to the tournament winners after the ceremony and is also used for promotional purposes.

== Performances ==

=== By club ===
A total of 34 clubs have appeared in the final, of whom 25 have won the competition. The most successful club in terms of wins and appearances in the final is Celtic, with 42 wins from 61. Rangers have finished runners-up on more occasions than any other club with 19 defeats in the final. The most recent winner is Celtic, who defeated Rangers 1–0 in the 2024 final.

=== Domestic double and treble ===

Clubs that win the Scottish Cup can complete a domestic &quot;double&quot; by becoming Scottish league champions in the same season. Only three clubs have won both competitions in the same season. Celtic have completed the domestic league and Scottish Cup double on 21 occasions, followed by Rangers on 18. The only other Scottish club to achieve this feat was Aberdeen, in 1983–84. Since the creation of the Scottish League Cup in 1947, clubs can complete a domestic treble by also winning this tournament in the same season. Celtic have achieved this feat on eight occasions, a world record achieved in 2023. Celtic won four consecutive domestic trebles (&quot;quadruple treble&quot;) in 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19 and 2019–20. No team had previously won consecutive trebles.

=== Cup &quot;shocks&quot; ===

Some clubs have become renowned for eliminating higher ranked clubs from the tournament despite being underdogs. Division Two club East Fife won the tournament in 1938 by defeating Division One club Kilmarnock, the first team from outside the top-tier of league football to win the trophy. East Fife had previously reached the final in 1927 after eliminating three higher ranked clubs in the preceding rounds. Hibernian became the second tier-two side to win the cup as they defeated Rangers, who were also then in the second tier, in the 2016 final. Only one other club from outside the top-tier of league football has won the competition; non-league Queen&#x27;s Park defeated Celtic in the 1893 final. Several other clubs have reached the final whilst competing outside the top-tier of league football, but were defeated in the final. These include Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, Airdrieonians, Falkirk (twice), Gretna, Queen of the South, Ross County, Hearts and Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

In the rounds before the final some notable shocks have occurred. In 1959, Dundee were eliminated by Highland League club Fraserburgh despite having Scotland internationals in their squad. A season later, Eyemouth United reached the quarter-finals after defeating two higher league clubs. In 1967, Berwick Rangers eliminated defending champions Rangers in the first round.

Celtic&#x27;s shock defeat by First Division club Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2000 led to the famous newspaper headline &quot;Super Caley go ballistic, Celtic are atrocious&quot;. In the 2020–21 competition Highland League club Brora Rangers knocked out Championship leaders Heart of Midlothian, who had been runners-up in each of the two previous seasons. Cup holders St Johnstone were knocked out by League Two (fourth tier) club Kelty Hearts in 2021–22.

Drumchapel United of the West of Scotland First Division, a seventh tier league in the Scottish pyramid, defeated League One side (third tier) Edinburgh in the 2022–23 edition. This was the biggest statistical cup shock in the history of the competition, with 62 places separating the teams in the leagues at the time. Later in that season West of Scotland Premier Division (sixth tier) side Darvel knocked out Premiership club Aberdeen, with 56 places separating the two teams.

Other results regarded as shocks include Stenhousemuir&#x27;s win against Aberdeen in 1995, Albion Rovers&#x27; defeat of Motherwell in 2013, and Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s away win against Rangers in 2025.

== Sponsorship ==
The Scottish Cup has been sponsored several times since the first organisation backed the tournament in 1983. The sponsor has been able to determine the name of the competition. There have been five sponsors since 1983 as well as several name changes within the duration of each sponsorship. The competition relies on revenue earned from these agreements although it ran without a title sponsor for over 100 years until the late 1980s.
The Scottish Health Education Group was the first organisation to sponsor the Scottish Cup in 1983 with the largest sponsorship package in Scottish football at the time, worth around £200,000. The partnership was praised for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle linked with football. The deal ended in 1989 when Tennent Caledonian Breweries won the sponsorship rights. Tennent&#x27;s association with the tournament raised the debate about alcohol sponsorship within sports following the riots at the 1980 Scottish Cup Final which resulted in the sale of alcohol being banned at Scottish sporting events. Despite this controversy, the partnership was largely successful and lasted 18 years until 2007. The SFA received around £25 million over the duration of the sponsorship deal. The Scottish Government in association with businessman Willie Haughey sponsored the Scottish Cup between 2008 and 2010. The 2008–09 competition was known as the Homecoming Scottish Cup to promote Scotland&#x27;s year of homecoming and tourism. The 2009–10 competition was known the Active Nation Scottish Cup to promote a healthy living through football. Carling was an additional sponsor between 2010 and 2014 as the competition&#x27;s official beer.

== Media coverage ==
Scottish Cup matches are currently broadcast live by both BBC Scotland in Scotland and Premier Sports across the rest of the United Kingdom.

BBC Radio Scotland provide radio coverage including several full live commentaries with additional commentaries broadcast on Radio Scotland&#x27;s local frequencies. Radio broadcasting rights are also held by BBC Radio nan Gàidheal and BBC Radio 5 Live also carry some games.

The Scottish FA sells overseas rights separately from their domestic contract. In Australia, the Scottish Cup is broadcast exclusively by Network 10, Paramount+. In the United States, the tournament is broadcast by ESPN.

The Scottish Cup Final is one of several events reserved for live broadcast in Scotland terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events.

<text>Kevin Arthur &quot;Dasher&quot; Wheatley, (13 March 1937 – 13 November 1965) was an Australian soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Wheatley was one of four Australians to receive the award for actions during the Vietnam War.

==Early years==
Wheatley was born in the Sydney suburb of Surry Hills on 13 March 1937, the third child of Raymond and Ivy (née Newman) Wheatley, both natives of Sydney. He was educated at Maroubra Junction Junior Technical School. Upon completing his schooling, Wheatley worked as a labourer in Sydney. On 20 July 1954, aged 17, he married Edna Davis; together they had four children. He was a keen rugby player, and he earned the nickname of &quot;Dasher&quot; on the field.

==Military service==
On 12 June 1956, at the age of 19, Wheatley enlisted in the Australian Army and after completing basic training he was allocated to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps and posted to the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Early the following year, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and he subsequently served a tour of Malaya between late 1957 and early 1959, during the Malayan Emergency. After his return to Australia, Wheatley served a posting with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in 1959–61 and then the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment from 1961 to 1965. He was promoted twice in 1964, firstly to sergeant and then warrant officer. In early 1965, he was posted to the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam and deployed to South Vietnam.

Early in his tour he was involved in an action with Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) regular troops in Quảng Trị Province. During the fighting, a child ran across the battlefield. Seeing the danger, Wheatley ran after the girl through the cross fire and brought her back to safety, using his own body to shield her. Later, in August 1965, during an attack on a Viet Cong (VC) held village Wheatley was recommended for an award by a US infantry advisor after he single-handedly exploited the position, carrying the attack up a steep slope as the VC forces withdrew. The recommendation was not acted upon at the time, however, and in September Wheatley was transferred to another team, known as the &quot;A Team&quot;, who were part of the 5th Special Forces Group. Under the command of Captain Felix Fazekas, the team operated around the village of Tra Bong.

Tra Bong was very isolated, with only a single road providing access. On 13 November, after this road had been captured by the VC, a group of Australian advisors, including Wheatley, accompanied a company from the Civil Irregular Defence Group (CIDG) on a &quot;search and destroy mission&quot;. Wheatley was assigned to one of the platoons with a fellow warrant officer, Ron Swanton. As the platoon advanced through rice paddies in the vicinity of Binh Hoa, they came under heavy fire from a larger VC force. In the ensuing fighting, Swanton was mortally wounded. As the situation grew more intense, Wheatley requested support from Fazekas and a medical evacuation for Swanton. When his platoon began to scatter, Wheatley carried the wounded Swanton to a safer area as Fazekas moved his troops to support. As the VC closed around his position, Wheatley insisted on staying with Swanton even though he was urged to leave by medical personnel. Wheatley was subsequently killed while defending his comrade.

==Victoria Cross citation==
Wheatley was 28 years old, and a warrant officer in the Australian Army Training Team when he performed the deed for which he was later awarded the VC. The citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, which announced Wheatley&#x27;s award on 15 December 1966 reads:

For his leadership of the attack on the Viet Cong-held village in August 1965, Wheatley was nominated for the US Silver Star, but the award was delayed due to Australian policies regarding the acceptance of foreign awards. The award was finally approved and presented to his son, George, in December 2021. Additionally, the South Vietnamese awarded Wheatley the Knight of the National Order of Vietnam, the Military Merit Medal and the Cross of Gallantry with Palm. Wheatley&#x27;s award was one of four Victoria Crosses bestowed upon members of the AATTV and was the first awarded to an Australian during the Vietnam War.

==Honours==
Wheatley was buried at Pine Grove Memorial Park in the Western Sydney suburb of Minchinbury. His Victoria Cross is on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, having been donated in 1993.

The stadium in the 1st Australian Support Compound at Vũng Tàu, South Vietnam was named in his honour.

On 2 September 2024, he was posthumously awarded the Medal for Gallantry for &quot;acts of gallantry in action in hazardous circumstances on 28 May and 18 August 1965 as an advisor and assistant advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.&quot;

<text>Emigrate is an industrial metal band formed in 2005 by Richard Kruspe of Rammstein as a side project. The band was formed in New York City and later relocated to Berlin. They have released four studio albums, with several musicians contributing to their recordings. Emigrate is a studio band, and have therefore never performed live.

== History ==

=== Formation and debut album (2000–2010) ===

During the recording of Rammstein&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Mutter&quot;, in 2000, tension and frustration within the band led Richard Kruspe to the idea of forming a side project where he could exercise full creative control. Kruspe relocated from Berlin to New York City in 2001 and officially formed Emigrate in 2005, during Rammstein&#x27;s break. The guitarist started writing songs with his then-wife, Caron Bernstein, and recruited guitarist and producer Olsen Involtini, bassist Arnaud Giroux and Clawfinger drummer Henka Johansson for the recording of their self-titled debut album. In September 2006, samples for the songs &quot;My World&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot; and &quot;Temptation&quot; off the band&#x27;s upcoming album were made available online. On 27 July 2007, Kruspe made an appearance on Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s radio show on BBC in promotion of their debut album. &quot;Emigrate&quot; was released on 31 August 2007 and co-produced by long-time Rammstein collaborater Jacob Hellner. The single &quot;My World&quot; was later included in the soundtrack for &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; and a video for the song featured footage from the movie. The single &quot;New York City&quot; was released in October 2007. Kruspe put Emigrate on hiatus following Rammstein&#x27;s decision to reunite and start work on their new studio album in 2007. A final single off the Emigrate&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Temptation&quot; was released in March 2008. Kruspe focused full-time on Rammstein for the next three years.

=== &quot;Silent So Long&quot; and &quot;A Million Degrees&quot; (2011–2019) ===
In 2011, Kruspe moved back to Berlin. In June of that year, Joe Letz, who had appeared in the band&#x27;s video for &quot;My World&quot; as a drummer, announced on social media that Kruspe had been working on a new album. In December 2012, an announcement made on Emigrate&#x27;s Facebook page announced that studio sessions had been scheduled for the following month for the recording of an untitled sophomore album. In January 2013, Kruspe stated on social media that drums were being mixed for the new record. In January 2014, Kruspe announced that twenty tracks had been recorded for the album and that mixing would be performed in Los Angeles alongside Ben Grosse, with a projected release in the summer of 2014. On 7 March, 2014, Kruspe announced that work on the band&#x27;s second album was completed. On July 22, 2014, a post was made to Emigrate&#x27;s official Facebook page with a teaser trailer to Emigrate&#x27;s new album, titled &quot;Silent So Long&quot; and an official release date of 17 October, 2014. &quot;Silent So Long&quot; was released on 9 December, 2014, and featured Mikko Sirén as the band&#x27;s new drummer, in addition to guest vocals from Lemmy, Marilyn Manson, Jonathan Davis and Peaches.

On July 26, 2018, a post on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page announced the upcoming filming of a new music video with guests Benjamin Kowalewicz and Ian D&#x27;Sa of Billy Talent, inviting applicants to participate in the video. The music video for the single &quot;1234&quot; was released on October 18. Emigrate&#x27;s third album, &quot;A Million Degrees&quot;, was released on November 30, 2018, and featured Kowalewicz, Till Lindemann and Cardinal Copia as guest vocalists, in addition to production and instrumental contributions by Sky van Hoff. Kruspe revealed in interviews that he was forced to re-record the album following a flooding in his studio that destroyed his hard drives in 2016. The videos for the album&#x27;s singles &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; and &quot;War&quot; was released on November 30, 2018 and March 5, 2019, respectively.

=== &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot; (2020–present) ===
Following Rammstein&#x27;s stadium tour in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kruspe began work on Emigrate&#x27;s fourth studio album, featuring songs written and recorded before the release of their debut album. The album &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot; was released on November 12, 2021 and produced by Kruspe, van Hoff and Olsen Involtini.

<doc id="883297" wikidata="Q933264" url="?curid=883297" title="Gulf of Fonseca">
<text>The Gulf of Fonseca (; ), a part of the Pacific Ocean, is a gulf in Central America, bordering El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

==History==
Fonseca Bay was discovered for Europeans in 1522 by Gil González de Ávila, and named by him after his patron, Archbishop Juan Fonseca, the implacable enemy of Columbus.

In 1849, E. G. Squier negotiated a treaty for the United States to build a canal across Honduras from the Caribbean Sea to the Gulf. Frederick Chatfield, the British commander in Central America, was afraid the American presence in Honduras would destabilize the British Mosquito Coast, and sent his fleet to occupy El Tigre Island at the entrance to the Gulf. Shortly thereafter, however, Squier demanded the British leave, since he had anticipated the occupation and negotiated the island&#x27;s temporary cession to the United States. Chatfield could only comply.

All three countries—Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua—with coastline along the Gulf have been involved in a lengthy dispute over the rights to the Gulf and the islands located within.

In 1917, the Central American Court of Justice ruled in a trial which became known as the &quot;Fonseca case&quot;. It arose out of a controversy between El Salvador and Nicaragua. The latter had entered the Bryan–Chamorro Treaty which granted a portion of the bay to the United States for the establishment of a naval base. El Salvador argued that this violated its right to common ownership in the bay. The court sided with El Salvador, but the US decided to ignore the decision.

International tensions over the Gulf were addressed by the United Nations ONUCA mission, starting in 1989 which included specific reference to the Gulf. For example, because the nature of the terrain in the region would have limited the efficacy of static observation posts, it was judged that the best results would be achieved by establishing mobile teams of observers, who would carry out regular patrols by road, by helicopter and, in the Gulf of Fonseca and nearby waters, by patrol boats and speedboats.

In 1992, a chamber of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) decided the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute, of which the Gulf dispute was a part. The ICJ determined that El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua were to share control of the Gulf of Fonseca. El Salvador was awarded the islands of Meanguera and Meanguerita, while Honduras was awarded El Tigre Island.

==Physical geography==

The Gulf of Fonseca covers an area of about , with a coastline that extends for , of which are in Honduras, in Nicaragua, and in El Salvador.

The climate in the Gulf is typical of tropical and subtropical regions, with two distinct seasons, the rainy and the dry. The Gulf receives nearly 80% of its total yearly rainfall of during the rainy season from May to November. The dry season occurs between December and May and contributes to an annual evaporation rate of . As a result of less water flowing into the Gulf, the currents tend to flow inward from the Pacific Ocean, and levels of salinity in the estuaries increase, and seasonal drought occurs.

Temperatures in the Gulf average between ; March and April are the warmest months and November and December the coolest. Relative humidity varies between 65 and 86% depending on location. In contrast, the interior of the country is semitropical and cooler with an average temperature of .

The vegetation of the wetland ecosystem is dominated by species of mangroves. Of the six species of mangrove identified in the Gulf, red mangrove (&quot;Rhizophora mangle&quot;) is the most common, mostly occupying the areas permanently inundated by the tides. Black mangrove (&quot;Avicennia germinans&quot;) is the second-most pervasive species and is generally found around the rivers where sediments are deposited along the shoreline. White mangrove (&quot;Laguncularia racemosa&quot;) is the third-most dominant, followed by botoncillo (&quot;Conocarpus erectus&quot;); both are generally found further inland and are inundated by the tide less frequently. The dominance of different species over others correlates with the frequency of floods, water quality, and levels of salinity.

The amplitude of tides is on average per day in the Gulf. During low tides, the soils are inhabited by crabs, conch, and other species. During the high tide, the mangrove forests serve as a feeding ground and habitat for fish, shrimp, and other species, as the root structure of mangroves provides a refuge from larger predators.

A number of volcanoes lie within and around the gulf.

==In popular culture==
The Horatio Hornblower novel &quot;The Happy Return&quot; (&quot;Beat To Quarters&quot;) is set partially in the Gulf of Fonseca.

<text>Long Low is a Neolithic and Bronze Age site in the English county of Staffordshire. It is about 2 km SE of Wetton ().

It consists of two round cairns linked by a connecting bank – an unusual layout and one that is unique in England. The northern cairn measures in diameter and survives to a height of . It appears to be related to other chamber tombs of the Peak District group and was excavated by Samuel Carrington in 1849. Carrington found a burial chamber built from limestone orthostats with a paved floor. The bones of thirteen individuals were recovered as well as three leaf-shaped flint arrowheads.

The smaller southern cairn is across and survives to in height following extensive modern damage. It contained evidence of a cremation burial. Further cremations were found in the connecting bank which was built from a parallel row of limestone orthostats and is around long, wide and high. It is now topped by a modern dry stone wall.

Because of the damage to the site, its rarity and the antiquity of the Carrington excavation it is unclear as to the precise nature of the monument. It is possible that the bank is a bank barrow which had a later Neolithic chambered cairn (the north cairn) built on one end and then a Bronze Age round barrow finally added at the southern end.

<doc id="883363" wikidata="Q21447146" url="?curid=883363" title="Dicyemida">
<text>Dicyemida, also known as Rhombozoa, is a phylum of tiny parasites that live in the renal appendages of cephalopods.

== Taxonomy ==

Classification is controversial. Traditionally, dicyemids have been grouped with the Orthonectida in the phylum Mesozoa and, from 2017, molecular evidence appears to confirm this.

However, other molecular phylogenies have placed the dicyemids more closely related to the roundworms. Additional molecular evidence suggests that this phylum is derived from the Lophotrochozoa.

The phylum (or class if retained within Mesozoa) contains three families, Conocyemidae, Dicyemidae and Kantharellidae, which have sometimes been further grouped into orders. Authors who treat Dicyemida as an order and separate the family Conocyemidae into a different order (Heterocyemida) prefer &#x27;Rhombozoa&#x27; as a more inclusive name for the phylum or class.

==Anatomy==
Adult dicyemids range in length from , and they can be easily viewed through a light microscope. They display eutely, a condition in which each adult individual of a given species has the same number of cells, making cell number a useful identifying character. Dicyemida lack respiratory, circulatory, excretory, digestive, and nervous systems.

The organism&#x27;s structure is simple: a single axial cell is surrounded by a jacket of twenty to thirty ciliated cells. The anterior region of the organism is termed a &quot;calotte&quot; and functions to attach the parasite to folds on the surface of its host&#x27;s renal appendages. When more than one species of dicyemida exist within the same host, they have distinctly shaped &quot;calottes&quot;, which range in shape from conical to disk shaped, or
cap shaped.
To this day, there has never been a recorded case of two separate species of dicyemida existing in the same host and having exactly the same &quot;calotte&quot;. Species that share similar or even identical &quot;calottes&quot; have been found on occasion, but have never been found within the same host. Because of the constant variation in &quot;calotte&quot; size between species (even within one given host) there is very rarely observable competition between the multiple Dicyemida species for habitat or other resources. &quot;Calotte&quot; shape determines where a dicyemid can comfortably live. In general, dicyemida with conical shaped &quot;calottes&quot; fit best within the folds of the kidneys, while those with rounded &quot;calottes&quot; (disk or cap shaped) are more easily able to attach to the smooth surfaces of the kidneys. This extreme segregation of habitats allows multiple species of dicyemids to comfortably exist within the same host while not still competing for space or resources (by occupying different ecological niches).

==Habitat==
While most dicyemid species have been found to prefer to live within specific cephalopods, no one species is unique in their preferences. In fact, It is also almost unheard of that a host infected with a dicyemid is only infected with one species. This means that if a select cephalopod is found to be infected with one species Dicyemid, their body will likely be found to contain organisms with a variety of &quot;calotte&quot; shapes, which means they are infected with multiple different species. On the occasion that similar (but not identical) &quot;calotte&quot; shapes happen to be present within one host’s body, one species usually ends up dominating the other, indicating that it has adapted more readily to the environment within the host. However, this occurrence is very rare and has only been observed a handful of times. In a study done on octopuses, it was found that Dicyemida that had similarly shaped &quot;calottes&quot; rarely coexisted in the same individual host, which suggested a strong level of competition for habitat.

In Japan, two types of dicyemid parasites, &quot;D. misakiense&quot; and &quot;D. japonicum&quot;, have often been discovered living in the same host. In 1938, when the two species were initially discovered, scientists did not classify them as separate species due to their large amount of morphological
similarities. In fact, the only difference between the two species that scientists were able to observe was between the shape of their &quot;calottes&quot;.The
idea that &quot;D. misakiense&quot; and &quot;D. japonicum&quot; are two different species is still very controversial among scientific groups. Some scientists have speculated that when closely related species of dicyemids coexist in the same region, such as in the case of &quot;D. misakiense&quot; and &quot;D. japonicum&quot;, competition for habitat causes them to evolve to develop two distinct &quot;calotte&quot; shapes.

==Life cycle==

Dicyemids exist in both asexual and sexual forms. The former predominate in juvenile and immature hosts, and the latter in mature hosts. The asexual stage is termed a &quot;nematogen&quot;; it produces &quot;vermiform&quot; larvae within the axial cell. These mature through direct development to form more nematogens. Nematogens proliferate in young cephalopods, filling the kidneys.

As the infection ages, perhaps as the nematogens reach a certain density, vermiform larvae mature to form &quot;rhombogens&quot;, the sexual life stage, rather than more nematogens. This sort of density-responsive reproductive cycle is reminiscent of the asexual reproduction of sporocysts or rediae in larval trematode infections of snails. As with the trematode asexual stages, a few nematogens can usually be found in older hosts. Their function may be to increase the population of the parasite to keep up with the growth of the host.

Rhombogens contain hermaphroditic gonads developed within the axial cell. These gonads, more correctly termed &quot;infusorigens&quot;, self-fertilise to produce &quot;infusoriform&quot; larvae. These larvae possess a very distinctive morphology, swimming about with ciliated rings that resemble headlights. It has long been assumed that this sexually produced infusoriform, which is released when the host eliminates urine from the kidneys, is both the dispersal and the infectious stage. The mechanism of infection, however, remains unknown, as are the effects, if any, of dicyemids on their hosts.

Some part of the dicyemid life cycle may be tied to temperate benthic environments, where they occur in greatest abundance. While dicyemids have occasionally been found in the tropics, the infection rates are typically quite low, and many potential host species are not infected. Dicyemids have never been reported from truly oceanic cephalopods, who instead host a parasitic ciliate fauna. Most dicyemid species are recovered from only one or two host species. While not strictly host specific, most dicyemids are only found in a few closely related hosts.

<text>West Mouse () is an islet lying off the north-west coast of Anglesey, Wales. Its maximum dimensions are , with an area of .

It is located in an area of notoriously strong tides. Because of this, at least three shipwrecks lie near it, making it a popular diving location. There is now a white beacon on the island which is used as a navigational aid if lined up with two other beacons, one on the Anglesey mainland and another on Coal Rock, an islet a mile and a half north. The area also host to species such as hornwrack, sea squirts and conger eels. The island is part of a set of three spread out along the north coast of Anglesey. The other two islands are Ynys Amlwch and Ynys Badrig.

The Welsh name &quot;Maen y Bugail&quot; translates into English as &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Stone&quot;. This comes from a folklore tale in which a shepherd who was looking for his sheep was annoyed by a stone in his shoe. He took the stone out and threw it into the Irish Sea, the island arising at the place in which it landed.

<doc id="883369" wikidata="Q524344" url="?curid=883369" title="Craig Brown (footballer, born 1940)">
<text>James Craig Brown (1 July 1940 – 26 June 2023) was a Scottish professional football player and manager. After his playing career with Rangers, Dundee and Falkirk was curtailed by a series of knee injuries, Brown entered management with Clyde in 1977. He then coached various Scotland youth teams until he was appointed Scotland manager in 1993. He held this position until 2001, the longest tenure for a Scotland manager, and they qualified for the UEFA Euro 1996 and 1998 FIFA World Cup tournaments. He later managed Preston North End, Motherwell and Aberdeen. He retired from management in 2013 and was appointed a non-executive director of Aberdeen.

==Early life==
Brown was born on 1 July 1940 in Corkerhill, Glasgow, but brought up with two younger brothers in Troon, Rutherglen and Hamilton, moving with his father&#x27;s career as a physical education teacher, later a senior advisor on the subject. He was a keen golfer as well as watching Queen&#x27;s Park and Hamilton Academical matches.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Educated at the former Hamilton Academy, Brown played for the school in Scottish schools competitions and in youth international teams, before joining Rangers in 1957, being considered a top prospect. 

===Rangers===
Brown was initially farmed out to Coltness United to gain experience, and was selected for the Scotland Junior squad. He failed to find a regular first team place at Rangers, with his progress halted by a knee injury and the arrival of Jim Baxter who played in the same position, and moved to Dundee on loan in October 1960.

===Dundee===
Brown was the first signing of Dundee manager Bob Shankly. Although knee surgery meant he barely played for the first team during his loan, the move was made permanent in the summer of 1961. Brown always travelled with the Dundee first team squad but this was before substitutes were commonly used. Thus he did not make a competitive appearance until November 1961, then waited until February 1962 for his league debut when captain Bobby Cox was injured. Brown played in nine consecutive league games before becoming injured himself on 31 March in a 3–2 win against bottom placed Stirling Albion. Dundee won the Scottish league title that season and Brown&#x27;s nine appearances entitled him to a medal. Brown stayed at Dundee for four and a half injury-affected years, making 16 total appearances for the Dark Blues but playing no active part in the club&#x27;s European Cup run, or the 1964 Scottish Cup Final which they lost to Rangers. During that time he also completed a course in physical education and primary teaching at Jordanhill College, and was also a member of the pop music group Hammy and the Hamsters formed by six Dundee players.

===Falkirk===
Brown signed for Falkirk in 1965 on a part-time basis and went on to make 42 total appearances at Brockville. He was released in 1967 and signed for Stranraer, but his injured knee almost immediately required him to call time on his playing career, and he returned the signing-on fee he had received from the club.

==Managerial career==
===Clyde===
Brown quickly showed a keen interest in being involved in the coaching side of football and he became assistant manager of Motherwell in 1974. He got his first managerial job as part-time manager of Clyde in 1977, where he spent ten seasons – winning the Second Division championship in his first season – whilst also working as a primary school head teacher then a lecturer in primary education at Craigie College, Ayr.

===Scotland===
Brown was in charge of Scotland&#x27;s youth teams. In 1989, he coached Scotland&#x27;s Under-16s to the final of the 1989 FIFA U-16 World Championship and three years later coached the under-21s to the semi-finals of the 1992 UEFA Under-21 Championship.

In July 1986, he took up the post of assistant manager of Scotland, also with responsibility for the under-21 team. Brown was assistant manager to Alex Ferguson for the Scotland senior team&#x27;s campaign at the 1986 FIFA World Cup (the appointment he said &#x27;changed his life&#x27; as it enabled him to move from being a part-time manager and teacher to a full member of the national coaching setup), and served the same role under Andy Roxburgh at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1992. He succeeded Roxburgh initially on an interim basis, after the team failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup; his debut was a 3–1 loss away to Italy.

====Euro 1996====
Brown took Scotland to Euro 96, as the team only conceded three goals in 10 qualifying matches as they finished second in Group 8. An Ally McCoist goal against Greece, scored with his first touch as a substitute after a long period out of international football due to a broken leg, proved key to securing qualification.

Scotland were drawn in the finals with the Netherlands, England (the host nation) and Switzerland. The opening game against the Netherlands ended in a goalless draw, then the match against England hinged on two moments late in the second half. With the score standing at 1–0 to England, Gary McAllister had a penalty kick saved by David Seaman and almost straight away Paul Gascoigne scored a brilliant goal to secure a 2–0 England win. This left Scotland needing an unlikely combination of results from the final games to qualify, but for a while this was happening as another McCoist goal gave them a 1–0 lead against Switzerland while the Netherlands were losing 4–0 to England. The Scots were unable to add to their lead, however, and a goal by Patrick Kluivert narrowed the Dutch defeat to 4–1, which meant that they progressed on goals scored.

====1998 World Cup====
Scotland also qualified for the 1998 World Cup under Brown, again only conceding three goals in their 10 qualifying matches as they finished second in UEFA Group 4. A notable incident during that qualifying phase was when Estonia refused to turn up for a match in Tallinn against Scotland. Brown had complained about the poor standard of floodlighting at the Kadriorg Stadium, which prompted FIFA to bring forward the kick-off time on the morning of the game. This decision upset the Estonians, who had their preparations disrupted and stood to lose some television revenue. Brown thought the Estonians would just protest the kick-off change and turn up at the last minute, but they did not and Scotland were left to kick-off without any opposition. The FIFA delegate at the match believed Scotland would be awarded a walkover win, but instead a committee ordered the game to be replayed at a neutral site. 

Scotland were drawn in Group A at the finals with Brazil, Norway and Morocco. As Brazil were the World Cup holders, this meant that Scotland played in the opening match of the tournament. Much of the preparation for that match focused on how to stop the star Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with his former club manager Bobby Robson advising Brown that the only way would be to stop him receiving the ball. The Scots were able to restrict Ronaldo, but lost 2–1 due to a Cesar Sampaio header from a corner and an unfortunate own goal by Tom Boyd. Brown cited a lack of on-field preparations immediately before the game, which were limited by opening match ceremonies, for them conceding the first goal from a set piece.

A 1–1 draw with Norway left Scotland needing a positive result against Morocco in their third match to have a chance of progressing. Scotland lost that match 3–0 and were eliminated them from the tournament, although a Norwegian win against Brazil meant that Morocco did not progress either. The result against Morocco was heavily criticised as Scotland had rarely conceded more than two goals in a game under Brown, although he cited secondary statistics (shots at goal, possession and corners) which suggested the performance was better than the one-sided scoreline.

====Euro 2000 qualifying====
Scotland finished second in their UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying group, which meant they entered a playoff against England. Scotland lost the first leg 2–0 at Hampden Park, but then won 1–0 at the old Wembley in the second, losing 2–1 on aggregate. Paul Scholes scored both England goals in the tie. Brown cited an injury to Paul Lambert, who would have been assigned with the task of marking Scholes, as being key to the Scots losing the tie.

====2002 World Cup qualification====
After Scotland finished third in their 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification group and failed to qualify for the World Cup, Brown resigned as Scotland manager in October 2001. He was replaced by German Berti Vogts. Brown took charge of Scotland for 70 international matches, more than any other Scotland manager. He won 32 games, drew 18 and lost 20. Scotland did not qualify for another major tournament until Euro 2020, and 1998 is still their most recent appearance in a men&#x27;s World Cup finals.

===Preston North End===
Brown then had a spell in club management when he was appointed manager of Preston North End in April 2002, but left by mutual consent on 29 August 2004 after a poor start to the league campaign. He later had a brief spell as football consultant at Derby County under former protégé Billy Davies, helping them win promotion to the Premier League in 2006–07. He was one of eight members of staff sacked alongside Davies in November after a poor start to the 2007–08 Premier League season.

In October 2008, the 68-year-old Brown was linked to the vacant managerial position with Scottish First Division side Dundee, but the job went to Jocky Scott.

===Motherwell===
On 28 December 2009, it was announced that Brown would be taking charge of Motherwell, with Archie Knox as his assistant. Brown and Knox established Motherwell in the top six of the Scottish Premier League during their time in charge.

===Aberdeen===
Brown, who was working without a contract at Motherwell, rebuffed an initial approach by Aberdeen on 8 December 2010. He then had a change of heart after a second approach was made, and was appointed Aberdeen manager on 10 December.

On 14 March 2013, Brown announced he was retiring from football management at the end of the 2012–13 season. His retirement date was brought forward when Derek McInnes was appointed to the position on 5 April, with Brown accepting a position on the Aberdeen board.

==Personal life==
Brown was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1999 Birthday Honours for services to football. Brown was also awarded an honorary Doctorate of Arts by Abertay University in 2001. 

Brown had two brothers: Jock was a football commentator, and Bob was the minister at Queen&#x27;s Cross Parish Church in Aberdeen from 1984 until his retirement in 2008. Brown&#x27;s grandson and namesake, Craig, plays for Montrose.

Brown died on 26 June 2023, five days before his 83rd birthday. His funeral was held at Masonhill Crematorium in Ayr, followed by a memorial service at Ayr Racecourse, on 25 July.

<text>The State of Westmoreland was a proposed self-proclaimed state that would have seceded from Pennsylvania in 1784, after the Congress of the Confederation had ruled that the territory belonged to Pennsylvania rather than Connecticut.

==History==
===Yankee-Pennamite Wars===
Both Pennsylvania and Connecticut claimed ownership of the lands between 41° N and 42° N, and this gave rise to a series of land-conflicts collectively referred to as the Yankee-Pennamite Wars (intermittently from 1769 to 1799). By the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War, the states had made conflicting land grants in the region and independently organized it politically. Connecticut created a County of Westmoreland, with a representative seated in its assembly from the Connecticut-settled Wyoming Valley, while Pennsylvania included the settled regions in its Northumberland County. The Congress of the Confederation was asked to decide on the legal owner.

With the Decree of Trenton on December 30, 1782, the confederation government officially decided that the region belonged to Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania ruled that the Connecticut settlers (&quot;Yankees&quot;) were not citizens of the Commonwealth, could not vote, and were to give up their property claims.

In May 1784, Pennsylvania armed men force-marched the Connecticut settlers away from the valley. In November, they returned with a greater force and captured and destroyed Fort Dickinson. With that victory, Captain John Franklin proposed that a new state separate from both Connecticut and Pennsylvania be created, to be called Westmoreland.

===Compromise===
To avoid further armed conflict, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania reversed its earlier decision about the Connecticut/Yankee settlers. It agreed that Yankee property claims that predated the Decree of Trenton should be honored, with compensation in the form of fresh grants being awarded to those holding conflicting Pennsylvania claims. Most Connecticut Yankees accepted the proposed compromise, part of which involved separating a sizable part of Northumberland County to organize a new county.

On September 23, 1786, the Pennsylvania General Assembly created Luzerne County, named for the French minister the Chevalier de la Luzerne. This newly organized county encompassed a large area; Lackawanna, Wyoming, Susquehanna, and part of Bradford counties were later formed from its territory. While this compromise brought an end to the proposed state, political discord among residents associated with the land conflict continued into the 19th century.

Note that both Westmoreland County, Connecticut, and the proposed State of Westmoreland are unrelated to the current Westmoreland County (located in southwestern Pennsylvania). It was created by an Act of the Assembly and approved on February 26, 1773 by Governor of Pennsylvania Richard Penn.

Connecticut, having lost control of the Wyoming Valley, held back in compensation an equivalent 120-mile strip of territory from its release of western land claims, starting at the Pennsylvania border, and this section of NE Ohio is now known as the Western Reserve.

The colony of the Windward Islands was created in 1833 and consisted of Grenada, Barbados (to 1885), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tobago (to 1889), St. Lucia (from 1838), and Dominica (from 1940). The Governor of Barbados was also the Governor of the Windward Islands, until Barbados became an independent colony in 1885. After this, a Governor of the Windward Islands was appointed with a seat in Grenada.

<text>In Search of the Castaways () is a novel by the French writer Jules Verne, published in 1867–68. The original edition, published by Hetzel, contains illustrations by Édouard Riou. In 1876, it was republished by George Routledge &amp; Sons as a three volume set titled A Voyage Round The World. The three volumes were subtitled &quot;South America&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;, and &quot;New Zealand&quot;. As often with Verne, English translations have appeared under different names; another edition has the overall title Captain Grant&#x27;s Children and has two volumes subtitled &quot;The Mysterious Document&quot; and &quot;Among the Cannibals&quot;. The modern unabridged English translation is done by Don Sample.

==Plot summary==
The book tells the story of the quest for Captain Grant of the &quot;Britannia&quot;. After finding a bottle the captain had cast into the ocean after the &quot;Britannia&quot; is shipwrecked, Lord and Lady Glenarvan of Scotland contact Mary and Robert, the young daughter and son of Captain Grant, through an announcement in a newspaper. The government refuses to launch a rescue expedition, but Lord and Lady Glenarvan, moved by the children&#x27;s condition, decide to do it by themselves. The main difficulty is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased, and only the latitude (37 degrees) is known; thus, the expedition would have to circumnavigate the 37th parallel south. The bottle was retrieved from a shark&#x27;s stomach, so it is impossible to trace its origin by the currents. Remaining clues consist of a few words in three languages. They are re-interpreted several times throughout the novel to make various destinations seem likely like Chile, Argentina, Southern Tip of Australia, at some times New Zealand and even the northernmost part of Antarctica (to which they never sailed).

Lord Glenarvan makes it his quest to find Grant; together with his wife, Grant&#x27;s children and the crew of his yacht, the &quot;Duncan&quot;, they set off for South America. An unexpected passenger in the form of French geographer Jacques Paganel (he missed his steamer to India by accidentally boarding the &quot;Duncan&quot;) joins the search. They explore Patagonia, Tristan da Cunha Island, Amsterdam Island, and Australia (a pretext to describe the flora, fauna, and geography of numerous places to the audience).

There, they find a former quartermaster of the &quot;Britannia&quot;, Ayrton, who proposes to lead them to the site of the wreckage. However, Ayrton is a traitor, who was not present during the loss of the &quot;Britannia&quot;, but was abandoned in Australia after a failed attempt to seize control of the ship to practice piracy. He tries to take control of the &quot;Duncan&quot;, but by sheer luck, this attempt also fails. However the Glenarvans, the Grant children, Paganel and some sailors are left in Australia, and mistakenly believing that the &quot;Duncan&quot; is lost, they sail to Auckland, New Zealand, from where they want to come back to Europe. When their ship is wrecked south of Auckland on the New Zealand coast, they are captured by a Māori tribe, but luckily manage to escape and board a ship that they discover, to their astonishment, to be the &quot;Duncan&quot;.

Ayrton, made a prisoner, offers to trade his knowledge of Captain Grant in exchange for being abandoned on a desert island instead of being surrendered to the British authorities. The &quot;Duncan&quot; sets sail for Tabor Island, which, by sheer luck, turns out to be Captain Grant&#x27;s shelter. They leave Ayrton in his place to live among the beasts and regain his humanity.

Ayrton reappears in Verne&#x27;s later novel, &quot;L&#x27;Île mystérieuse&quot; (&quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, 1874).

<doc id="883417" wikidata="Q7568117" url="?curid=883417" title="South Pacific Television">
<text>South Pacific Television (SPTV) was a television channel in New Zealand, which operated between 1976 and 1980.

==History ==
The channel, then known as TV2, first went to air on 30 June 1975. It was the second national government television channel to be established in the country that year, after Television One went to air on 1 April, replacing the former New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s TV service.

In its first week, the network held New Zealand&#x27;s first Telethon in aid of the St John Ambulance. It raised $593,878.

The channel could only be picked up in Auckland and Christchurch when it first went to air, but it was limited in Christchurch due to a faulty transmitter. It was another three months before the Waikato and Bay of Plenty got coverage and by late November, the channel was available in Wellington before spreading throughout the rest of the country.

In December 1976, TV2 was rebranded as South Pacific Television (SPTV) to distinguish itself from the former NZBC channel. It also reduced confusion in Auckland and Dunedin where Television One broadcast on channel 2 (TV2 broadcast on channel 4 in both centres).

In 1977, broadcasting hours were cut on both channels and as a result SPTV lost 16 hours of broadcast time a week, forcing the channel to begin its daily broadcasts at 3pm (except weekends, where SPTV opened transmission at midday).

Channel funding was cut for Television One and handed over to SPTV in a move that bewildered some over at Television One. The effects of the cuts saw programme output on SPTV increase.

==Fate==
It was decided in 1979 by the National Government that the channels would be amalgamated under an administration which would end the competition that reared its head in 1975.

SPTV&#x27;s final day of transmissions was 15 February 1980. The final programme was a two-hour farewell special, and the channel closed down at 12:15am on the morning of 16 February.

The next day, 16 February 1980, Television One and SPTV were dissolved and became Television One and Television Two, under the newly formed Television New Zealand (TVNZ). A number of SPTV&#x27;s programmes moved across to the new networks.

<doc id="883424" wikidata="Q3134130" url="?curid=883424" title="Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Bethnal Green and Bow was a constituency in Greater London, represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament from 2010 until its abolition for the 2024 general election by Rushanara Ali of the Labour Party.

Under the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, the majority of the constituency was incorporated into the re-established seat of [[Bethnal Green and Stepney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Stepney]], with Bow being included in the newly created constituency of [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Stratford and Bow]].

==Boundaries==

Following a review of ward boundaries in Tower Hamlets which became effective in May 2014, the contents (but not the boundaries) of the constituency were changed to: 
* Weavers, Spitalfields and Banglatown, Whitechapel, St. Peter&#x27;s, Bethnal Green, Stepney Green, St. Dunstan&#x27;s, Bow West, Bow East.

===History of boundaries===
The 1974–83 constituency comprised the then London Borough of Tower Hamlets wards of Bethnal Green Central, Bethnal Green East, Bethnal Green North, Bethnal Green South, Bethnal Green West, Bow North, Bow South, Bromley, Holy Trinity, and Spitalfields.

Between the 1983 and 1997 general elections, the equivalent seat was Bethnal Green and Stepney.

The Tower Hamlets wards of Blackwall and Cubitt Town, Bromley-by-Bow, East India and Lansbury, Limehouse, Mile End East, Millwall, St Katherine&#x27;s, Wapping, and Shadwell were before 2010 under the national Boundary Commission for England review which identified a need for London representation changes based on electorate estimates moved to the new constituency of Poplar and Limehouse. In this review a name change to &quot;Tower Hamlets North&quot; was publicly consulted on and rejected.

From 2010 to 2014, the seat had electoral wards:

*Bethnal Green North, Bethnal Green South, Bow East, Bow West, Mile End and Globe Town, St Dunstan&#x27;s and Stepney Green, Spitalfields including Brick Lane, Weavers, and Whitechapel &quot;in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&quot;

==Constituency profile==
The seat was centred on the northern part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It included much of the traditional East End. The seat has a large Muslim community – one of the largest proportion of Muslim voters in the country. Whereas the seat has many small conservation areas, it measures overall as among the poorest by income in London and is one of the most ethnically diverse, there is no majority ethnic group — large ethnic groups are British Bangladeshi, White British, other White European and Black British.

Workless claimants who were registered jobseekers were in November 2012 higher than the national average of 3.8%, at 6% of the population based on a statistical compilation by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
==History==

===Political history===
Bethnal Green and Bow is, based on results in local and national elections, traditionally a very safe Labour seat, its predecessor seats being held by Labour since prior to World War II. However, the 2005 Respect victory in this constituency bucked that trend when the electorate voted for expelled Labour MP, George Galloway, generally considered to be far-left, who mounted a campaign focussed on two seats (see Poplar and Shoreditch and see, as to council representation, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets).

===1970s–1994===
In 1974 the Bethnal Green constituency was abolished. A new seat was created with the strict official name of Tower Hamlets, Bethnal Green and Bow. However the London Borough prefix is not commonly used for seats in the 1974–1983 redistribution.

The 1974–1983 constituency was a safe Labour seat, with the Liberal Party in a distant second place. Ian Mikardo, a well known back bench Labour MP, represented the area in this period.

Between 1983 and 1997, most of the present constituency formed the seat of Bethnal Green and Stepney.

The borough of Tower Hamlets has a reputation for being a bastion of radical politics, historically with a minority of Communists on its council and more recently with Respect forming the largest opponents to the quite frequent large Labour majorities on the council level. Before a recent revival, the Conservative Party were absent from the council from 1931 until 2006 – and all of its revival has been in the two riverside wards which does not apply to any of this seat. The Liberal Party remained the main challengers to Labour in the Bethnal Green area but the loss of Percy Harris as Bethnal Green South West MP and eventually as London County Councillor too (despite a temporary comeback in 1946) put them out of the running in Parliamentary elections until a Liberal revival began in Bow in the late 1970s. Tower Hamlets was the only London Borough to have had seats held by the Communist Party of Great Britain; they lost their last seats in 1971. Between 1945 and 1950, Mile End provided the CPGB with one of its two parliamentary seats, being represented by Phil Piratin. Two Communists also won seats on the London County council (LCC) in 1947.

Between 1986 and 1994, the Liberal Democrats controlled Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, this proved a successful but controversial period. The delivery of major infrastructure projects, including many schools and school housing projects, was balanced by alleged corruption.

===1997–2010===
At the 1997 general election, there was a swing of 5% to the Conservative Party at a time when the national trend was a landslide swing against them. Bethnal Green and Bow was one of only two Labour-held constituencies to have any sort of pro-Conservative swing. Broadsheets and local newspapers ascribed this unusual result to problems over the selection of a Labour candidate, following the retirement of Peter Shore. Oona King, who won the selection, was not well known and many in the local area would have preferred a candidate from a Bangladeshi background. However the leading Bangladeshi candidates in the local Labour Party were excluded from the selection. The only other constituency to have a pro-Conservative swing was Bradford West, who similarly had selected a Sikh rather than a Muslim candidate.

Following British participation in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an action deeply unpopular with the Muslim community in the constituency but nevertheless supported by King, the newly formed Respect Party gained support. They topped the poll in Tower Hamlets in the 2004 European Parliamentary elections and subsequently won their first local council seat at a by-election. In the 2005 general election, the seat was a narrow victory for ex-Labour MP George Galloway, one of Respect&#x27;s leading figures. Respect also won seats at the 2006 local council elections although its performance was not as strong as many observers believed it could have been.

Galloway attracted criticism for lack of attendance at Parliament, especially when he appeared on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. He said that he had not missed any crucial votes, and that the best way for him to advance the interests of his constituents was by general campaigning. Galloway had always said that he only intended to stay in the seat for one parliament, and in 2010 stood for the neighbouring constituency of Poplar and Limehouse. However, he lost to the Labour incumbent Jim Fitzpatrick.

===2010 general election===
In September 2007, the Respect Party selected Abjol Miah, the leader of the Respect Group on Tower Hamlets Council, as their candidate to replace George Galloway in Bethnal Green and Bow. Miah had worked in the local area as a radio presenter, drugs worker and martial arts trainer. The Labour Party selected Rushanara Ali, an Oxford graduate and then-charity worker for the Young Foundation who had previously worked as Parliamentary Assistant to the constituency&#x27;s former Labour MP, Oona King. Ajmal Masroor, a television presenter on political debates and an imam, was the Liberal Democrat candidate. Zakir Khan was selected by the Conservative Party from an open primary. He was the head of Public Affairs for the Canary Wharf Group based in Tower Hamlets, and a former sports manager.

The election result was a clear win for Labour, this constituency being one of only three that Labour had gained at the 2010 general election, and represented a major setback for Respect (which thereby lost its sole seat in Parliament). Ali won with 21,784 votes (42.9%, up 8.4% for Labour); Masroor came in second with 10,210 (20.1%, up 7.8% for the Liberal Democrats); Miah received 8,532 votes, 16.8% of the total, representing a 19.8% fall in the Respect vote; and Khan received 7,071 (13.9%, a 2.0% increase in the Conservative vote). However, George Galloway did not contest re-election as MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, instead contesting Poplar and Limehouse. He finished in third place there, behind the Conservatives and Labour; but went on to win the Bradford West constituency at a by-election held on 29 March 2012.

The constituency has recently become one of the most ethnically diverse areas in the UK, 3.11% of the population were of mixed race, the largest non-mixed ethnic group was white at 41.9 per cent of the population (and of the total: 33.6% of British ethnicity), the second largest ethnic group was Bangladeshi which formed 33.4 per cent of the population, other Asians 6.59 per cent (comprises British Indians, British Pakistanis and other Asians), those of Black race constituted 4.9 per cent (see British African-Caribbean community), Chinese 1.81 per cent, and other ethnic groups, including Arab heritage 2.24 per cent. Statistics from the census recorded 35.4 per cent of people are Muslims, among the highest ten seats by Muslim proportion of the population in the UK.

In 2001 the largest two groups were in the same order, but constituted 46.4% and 35.7% of the population, respectively.

<text>The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) is a camera on board the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter. It images Mars in the visible and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to determine the thermal properties of the surface and to refine the distribution of minerals on the surface of Mars as determined by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). Additionally, it helps scientists to understand how the mineralogy of Mars relates to its landforms, and it can be used to search for thermal hotspots in the Martian subsurface.

THEMIS is managed from the Mars Space Flight Facility at Arizona State University and was built by the Santa Barbara Remote Sensing division of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, an American multinational conglomerate headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. The instrument is named after Themis, the goddess of justice in ancient Greek mythology.

==Infrared camera==

THEMIS detects thermal infrared energy emitted by the Martian surface at nine different wavelengths. Eight of these have wavelengths between 6 and 13 micrometers, an ideal region of the infrared spectrum to determine thermal energy patterns characteristic of silicate minerals. The ninth band is at 14.9 micrometers and is used to monitor the Martian atmosphere. The shortest infrared wavelength, at 6.78 micrometers, is measured twice in two bands to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. THEMIS is therefore a 10-band instrument that detects nine different wavelengths .

The absorption spectrum measured by THEMIS contains two kinds of information: temperature and emissivity. The temperature contribution to the measurement dominates the spectrum unless the data is corrected. In effect, a THEMIS infrared image taken during the day will look much like a shaded relief map, with slopes facing the sun being bright (hot) and shaded areas being dark (cold). In a THEMIS image taken at night, however, thermophysical properties of the surface can be inferred, such as temperature differences due to the materials&#x27; grain size (thermal inertia).

The effect of temperature can be removed from THEMIS infrared data by dividing the image by a black body curve. The resulting energy pattern is an emissivity spectrum characteristic of the specific minerals (or other things) found on the surface. The presence of minerals such as carbonates, silicates, hydroxides, sulfates, amorphous silica, oxides, and phosphates can be determined from THEMIS measurements.

In particular, this multi-spectral method allows researchers to detect the presence of minerals that form in water and to understand those minerals in their geological context.

The THEMIS infrared camera was designed to be used in conjunction with data from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), a similar instrument on Mars Global Surveyor. While THEMIS has a very high spatial resolution (100 m) with a low spectral resolution of only 10 bands between 6 and 15 micrometers, TES has a low spatial resolution (3×6 km) with very high spectral resolution of 143 bands between 5 and 50 micrometers.

The instrument&#x27;s approach provides data on localized deposits associated with volcanoes, hydrothermal processes, and the alteration of minerals by surface and/or subsurface water.

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), an Earth orbiting instrument on the Terra spacecraft, has used a similar approach to map the distribution of minerals on Earth. Variations in the thermal infrared false-color image are due to differences in the minerals that make up rocks and soil.

== Discovery of a variety of rocks ==
THEMIS found a wide range of igneous rocks and minerals. Some of the rocks were low-silica basalts, high silica dacite, olivine basalts, ultramafic (picritic) basalts, and quartz-bearing granitoid rocks. The olivine basalts were present in a variety of locations, such as on crater floors and in some canyon wall layers. The mineral olivine is important because it is common in more primitive magmas from the mantle and it weathers quickly when moisture is present. So, if olivine is present, the climate must have been dry since the time that olivine was exposed. Quartz-bearing rocks were found in the central uplifts in craters. Rocks in the central uplifts were probably once buried several kilometers beneath the surface, but raised by the impact process. Rocks of dacite composition show that, within magma chambers, fractional crystallization occurred. In this process, some minerals form crystals, then settle to the bottom of the chamber. Having a variety of rocks increases the chances that some useful/valuable minerals may be found on Mars.

==Visible camera==
THEMIS has a visible imaging camera that acquires data in five spectral bands, takes images with a spatial resolution of 18 m (59&#x27;), and can resolve objects about the size of a semi-trailer. This resolution is intermediate between large-scale images from the Viking Orbiters (150 to 300 meters per pixel) and the high-resolution images from the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) on board Mars Global Surveyor (1.5 to 3 meters per pixel). Visible images from THEMIS are usually close to 20 km wide (12 miles).

The THEMIS visible camera&#x27;s stated purpose is to determine the geological record of past liquid and volcanic environments on Mars. Additionally, this dataset can be used in conjunction with the infrared data to identify potential landing sites for future Mars missions.

<text>The Ossola (; ), also Valle Ossola or Val d&#x27;Ossola (; ), is an area of Northwest Italy situated to the north of Lago Maggiore. It lies within the Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola. Its principal river is the Toce, and its most important town Domodossola.

== Etymology ==
There are many etymological claims as to the origins of the name &quot;Ossola&quot;, the most likely being Celtic for &quot;high lands&quot;. The German and Walser names for the valley translate to &quot;valley of the ash trees&quot;.

== Geography ==
Ossola is composed of one main valley (the Ossola proper) and seven side valleys: Anzasca, Antrona, Bognanco, Divedro, Antigorio, Formazza, Isorno and Vigezzo.

It is surrounded by the Pennine Alps on the western side and by the Lepontine Alps on the northern and eastern sides.

The main towns are Domodossola, Villadossola, Crevoladossola, Ornavasso and Mergozzo.

Ossola’s highest elevation is the Nordend, a peak of the Monte Rosa Massif, which is also the highest peak of Piedmont. Excluding the Monte Rosa&#x27;s peaks, other important mountains are the Pizzo d&#x27;Andolla, the Monte Leone, the Corno Cieco and, in the lower part of the valley, the Monte Capezzone and the Monte Massone.

It is home to the Alpe Veglia and Alpe Devero Natural Park, Alta Valle Antrona Natural Park and also includes parts of the Val Grande National Park, Italy’s largest wilderness area.

== History ==
===Republic of Ossola===

In 1944, with the Allies of World War II still stuck south of the Apennines and Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italian Social Republic controlling all of Northern Italy, the Italian partisans staged an uprising behind German lines, led by the Committee of National Liberation of Upper Italy. This rebellion led to the establishment of a number of provisional partisan governments throughout Northern Italy, of which the Free Republic of Ossola was the most prominent. It received official recognition from Switzerland and from Allied consulates in Switzerland. Within a few weeks, German reinforcements had crushed the uprising, and the area&#x27;s liberation had to wait until the final offensives of 1945.

The film was directed by Dominic Sena, written by Scott Rosenberg, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The film is a loose remake of the 1974 H. B. Halicki film of the same name.

The film was shot from May to October 1999, throughout Los Angeles and Long Beach, California. It was released on June 9, 2000, by Buena Vista Pictures (through its Touchstone Pictures label). Upon release, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its writing, direction, as well as acting and action sequences. Despite the critical response, the film grossed $237 million against an estimated production budget of $90 million.

==Plot==

Car thief Kip Raines works with his gang to steal 50 high-end cars for Raymond Calitri, a British gangster in Long Beach, California. After stealing a Porsche 996 from a showroom, Kip unwittingly leads the police to his crew&#x27;s warehouse, forcing the thieves to flee. Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff impound the stolen cars and open an investigation. Atley Jackson, Calitri&#x27;s associate, reaches out to Kip&#x27;s brother Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines, a notorious but reformed car thief. Memphis meets with Calitri, who has kidnapped Kip and plans to kill him in a car crusher. Memphis agrees to steal the 50 cars within 72 hours, and Kip is released; Calitri warns that if the cars are not delivered on time, Kip will be killed.

Memphis visits his mentor Otto Halliwell, and they assemble a crew of old associates: Donny Astricky, now a driving instructor; Sphinx, a mute mortician; and Sara &quot;Sway&quot; Wayland, a mechanic and bartender. Kip and his crew volunteer to help, and the group tracks down the cars, giving each a code name; Memphis insists on saving a 1967 Ford Shelby GT500, dubbed &quot;Eleanor&quot;—which he has attempted to steal before—for last. While scouting the cars, he and Kip narrowly avoid being killed by a rival gang. Hoping to deliver the cars before they can be traced, the crew plans to steal every car in one night.

Castlebeck and Drycoff learn that Kip bribed a Mercedes dealership employee to order laser-cut transponder keys, enabling the detectives to stakeout the Mercedes cars on the crew&#x27;s list. A member of Kip&#x27;s crew impulsively steals a Cadillac Eldorado not on the list, and the crew discovers a stash of heroin in the trunk. Castlebeck arrives, forcing the crew to distract him while they dispose of the drugs. He leaves, having ascertained that the heist is happening that night.

The crew sets their heist in motion, stealing the various cars and delivering them to Atley on the docks. As they prepare to use the transponder keys to steal the Mercedes cars, Memphis spots Castlebeck and Drycoff watching from a surveillance van. Abandoning the cars under surveillance, the crew breaks into the police impound lot, distracting the guard and stealing the Mercedes cars originally stolen by Kip&#x27;s crew; the plan is hampered temporarily when Otto&#x27;s dog eats and eventually passes, the keys. Memphis and Sway rekindle their past romance while stealing a Lamborghini Diablo. Castlebeck and Drycoff return to the warehouse seized from Kip&#x27;s crew. Having found pieces of a broken blacklight lamp, the detectives discover the crew&#x27;s list of 50 cars written in UV-sensitive paint. With too many cars to track, Castlebeck focuses on the Shelby GT500, knowing Memphis will steal it last, and determines its location. When the crew steals a Cadillac Escalade, security is alerted, and a member of Kip&#x27;s crew is injured. Memphis steals Eleanor just as the detectives arrive and leads police on a chase through the city and into a shipyard. Reaching the Vincent Thomas Bridge, blocked by an accident, Memphis jumps Eleanor off the ramp of a tow truck and lands on the other side, evading Castlebeck, Drycoff, LAPD, and CHP that had surrounded him.

Memphis arrives at Calitri&#x27;s junkyard 12 minutes late, and Calitri refuses to accept the slightly damaged Shelby, ordering his men to crush the car and kill Memphis. Kip and Atley use the junkyard crane to knock out the henchmen, and an armed Calitri pursues Memphis into the warehouse as the detectives arrive. Calitri prepares to shoot Castlebeck, but Memphis kicks Calitri over a railing to his death. A grateful Castlebeck lets Memphis go free, and Memphis tells him where to find the container ship full of stolen cars.

The crew celebrates with a barbecue, and Kip reveals that he has bought Memphis a dilapidated 1967 Shelby GT500 which Memphis also calls &quot;Eleanor&quot;, which Otto promises to restore. Memphis invites Sway on a ride, but the car breaks down just as they drive away.

<text>The following is a list of radio stations in New Zealand.

== New Zealand network stations ==

Several networks operate across multiple centres or nationwide. Most have resulted from the consolidation of a group of existing stations and many have changed their name over time. The Sound was previously Solid Gold. TAB Trackside, suspended operations 12 April 2020, was previously LiveSport, BSport and Radio Pacific. SENZ launched on 19 July 2021 on the former TAB Trackside frequencies, and was replaced by Sport Nation on 19 November 2024. Mix (formerly Mix 98.2), was a reincarnation of Easy Mix, Viva and Easy Listening, and Radio Sport was replaced by Gold on 1 July 2020. The now-defunct Kiwi FM was previously Channel Z. The Wolf and Today FM (&quot;formerly Magic Talk and Radio Live&quot;) were closed.

<doc id="883437" wikidata="Q506032" url="?curid=883437" title="Shallow Grave (1994 film)">
<text>Shallow Grave is a 1994 British black comedy crime film directed by Danny Boyle, in his feature directorial debut, and starring Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston, and Kerry Fox. Its plot follows a group of flatmates in Edinburgh who set off a chain of events after dismembering and burying a mysterious new tenant who died and left behind a large sum of money. The film was written by John Hodge, marking his first screenplay.

The production was funded by Channel 4 Television and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, and the film was distributed by Rank Film Distributors in the UK, while Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International distributed the film in other countries. &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; received generally favourable reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $19.8 million worldwide.

== Plot ==
Chartered accountant David Stevens shares a flat in Edinburgh with physician Juliet Miller and journalist Alex Law. Needing a new flatmate, the trio interview several applicants in a calculatedly cruel manner, amusing themselves at the applicants&#x27; expense before finally offering the room to a mysterious man named Hugo. Shortly after he moves in, the trio finds Hugo dead from an apparent drug overdose in his room, as well as a large suitcase full of money. The friends agree to conceal the death and keep the money for themselves. They decide to remove the identifying features—hands, feet and teeth—from Hugo&#x27;s body and bury the remains in the woods. David is given the gruesome task of dismembering the corpse after they draw lots, while Juliet disposes of the leftovers in her hospital&#x27;s incinerator.

Unknown to them, Hugo is being sought by a pair of violent criminals who are torturing and murdering informants as they follow Hugo&#x27;s trail. The flat below theirs is broken into, making them anxious. While Juliet and Alex go on a shopping spree with the money to &quot;feel better,&quot; David&#x27;s fears turn into full-blown paranoia. He hides the suitcase of money in the attic and begins living there, drilling holes in the attic floor to watch the living space below. The relationship between the three begins to deteriorate.

The criminals break into the flat, beating Alex and Juliet until Alex reveals where the money is. As the men enter the dark attic, David kills both of them with a hammer and returns to the woods to dispose of the bodies. Alex and Juliet become worried about David&#x27;s mental state, and David becomes worried that the two are conspiring against him. The police, investigating the prior intrusion, are surprised when the three friends deny that they ever had a fourth flatmate.

The bodies are discovered in the woods, and Alex is sent by his editor to cover the story. With the police now closing in, Juliet seduces David into giving her the money so she can buy plane tickets to Rio de Janeiro and they can run away together, but secretly she plans to go alone and leave the other two to take the fall. Alex returns from work and—realising that Juliet and David are working together and that his life is in danger—tries to phone the police. Their confrontation escalates to violence. David reveals that he knew about Juliet&#x27;s secret plan to betray both him and Alex, and punches her, prompting Alex to attack him too. Alex collapses after being stabbed in the shoulder by David, but Juliet kills David before he can finish the job.

With David dead, Juliet decides to force the knife deeper into Alex&#x27;s shoulder, pinning him to the floor, so that the police will find him with David&#x27;s body and blame him for all four of the deaths. She flees with the suitcase to the airport—but in the car park she breaks down hysterically when she discovers that it is actually filled with hundreds of newspaper clippings about the triple shallow grave, taken from Alex&#x27;s newspaper. With no possessions other than the plane ticket, and no other way out, she calmly boards the plane to Rio.

The police arrive at the flat to find Alex alive and grinning—he had hidden the cash under the same floorboards where Juliet had skewered him. David finishes the monologue that began the film, the entirety of which is now revealed to be a flashback. A sheet is drawn over his face and his body is slid into a drawer in the morgue.

== Cast ==

* Kerry Fox as Juliet Miller: A spirited and mysterious doctor who is constantly being courted by different men, many of whom repeatedly call the flat trying to speak to her. Despite this, she also appears to be in a relationship with David as well as openly flirting with Alex.
* Christopher Eccleston as David Stevens: A shy chartered accountant who keeps a low profile. After drawing the short straw and having to cut up the body, he becomes introverted and paranoid.
* Ewan McGregor as Alex Law: A cheeky, vain, and self-described &quot;hack&quot; journalist. Alex works for the local paper and is able to find out inside information of the police investigation. His confidence in their plot starts to be undermined by David&#x27;s deteriorating mental health.
* Ken Stott as Detective Inspector McCall
* Keith Allen as Hugo: An enigmatic man who rents the spare room under the pretence of being a writer. He is later found dead after a drug overdose, leaving a suitcase full of money under his bed.
* Colin McCredie as Cameron: A potential flatmate who is interviewed at the beginning of the film. He is ridiculed and then thrown out by Alex and the housemates. Later, at a party, he punches Alex after being mocked again.
* Victoria Nairn as Woman Visitor: The &quot;identify this song&quot; potential flatmate.
* Gary Lewis as Male Visitor: The &quot;not having an affair&quot; potential flatmate.
* Jean Marie Coffey as Goth: A potential flatmate.
* Peter Mullan as Andy: A murderous thug searching for Hugo and the money.
* Leonard O&#x27;Malley as Tim: A murderous thug searching for Hugo and the money.

In addition, the film&#x27;s screenwriter, John Hodge, appears in the role of Detective Constable Mitchell, whose main duty appears to be writing: &quot;Make a note of that, Mitchell. ... Write it down.&quot;

== Production ==
===Shooting===
Shooting for &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; lasted for thirty days. The tight budgetary restraints during filming meant many of the props had to be auctioned off for them to afford sufficient film stock.

Boyle claimed that Christopher Eccleston was so afraid of getting locked in a real-life mortuary for a scene, he had to ask a crew member to stand in the shadows and comfort the nervous actor.

Danny Boyle said in his commentary on the 2009 Special Edition DVD and 2012 Blu-ray that Alex is not meant to be dead, so the line of Alex saying hello to the detective was added in post-production to clarify this.

=== Filming locations ===
The crew shot predominantly in Glasgow rather than Edinburgh, which is where the story is set, since the Glasgow Film Fund gave them a £150,000 (£ today) grant. Locations in the film include Flat 6 North East Circus Place in New Town, Edinburgh. Hospital scenes were filmed at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, Renfrewshire. The dance scene was filmed at the Townhouse Hotel, 54 West George Street, near George Square in Glasgow.

== Reception ==
&quot;Shallow Grave&quot; earned Boyle the Best Newcomer Award from the 1996 London Film Critics Circle and, together with &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, led to critical commentary that Boyle had revitalised British cinema in the early 1990s.

===Box office===
The film was the most commercially successful British film of 1995 with a gross of £5.2 million. The film was a success in Europe but grossed a total of just $2,834,250 in the United States. It led to Boyle&#x27;s internationally successful production, &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, two years later.

===Critical response===
 On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on 20 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.
Caroline Westbrook of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave it 5 out of 5 and wrote: &quot;This, the debut feature from acclaimed TV director Danny Boyle, is the best British thriller for years, a chilling and claustrophobic heart-stopper centring on a moral dilemma destined to fuel many a dinner party conversation.&quot; Quentin Curtis of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;What makes the film fascinating, and exciting, is its marriage of British setting and American, B-movie format.&quot;

Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine called it &quot;a tar-black comedy that zings along on a wave of visual and scripting inventiveness.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 2 out of 4, and wrote &quot;All of the materials are in place [...] But somehow they never come together.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was critical of the film and said &quot;misanthropy overwhelms his film in ways that prove more sour than droll, despite the presence of skillful actors and a bizarrely enveloping plot.&quot;

<text>The Italian Resistance (, ), or simply &quot;La&quot; , consisted of all the Italian resistance groups who fought the occupying forces of Nazi Germany and the fascist collaborationists of the Italian Social Republic during the Second World War in Italy from 1943 to 1945. As a diverse anti-fascist and anti-nazist movement and organisation, the opposed Nazi Germany and its Fascist puppet state regime, the Italian Social Republic, which the Germans created following the Nazi German invasion and military occupation of Italy by the and the from 8 September 1943 until 25 April 1945.

General underground Italian opposition to the Fascist Italian government existed even before World War II, but open and armed resistance followed the German invasion of Italy on 8 September 1943: in Nazi-occupied Italy, the Italian Resistance fighters, known as the (partisans), fought a (&#x27;national liberation war&#x27;) against the invading German forces; in this context, the anti-fascist of the Italian Resistance also simultaneously participated in the Italian Civil War, fighting against the Italian Fascists of the collaborationist Italian Social Republic.

The Resistance was a diverse coalition of various Italian political parties, independent resistance fighters and soldiers, and partisan brigades and militias. The modern Italian Republic was declared to be founded on the struggle of the Resistance: the Constituent Assembly was mostly composed of representatives of the parties that had given life to the Italian Resistance&#x27;s National Liberation Committee. These former Italian Resistance fighters wrote the Constitution of Italy at the end of the war based on a compromissory synthesis of their Resistance parties&#x27; respective principles of democracy and anti-fascism.

==Background==

The Italian Resistance has its roots in anti-fascism, which progressively developed in the period from the mid-1920s, when weak forms of opposition to the fascist regime already existed, until the beginning of World War II. Furthermore, in the memory of the partisan fighters, especially those of communist and socialist inspiration, the memory of the &quot;Biennio Rosso&quot; and of the violent struggles against the fascist squads in the period 1919–1922, considered by some exponents of the left-wing parties (among which Palmiro Togliatti himself) a true &quot;civil war&quot; in defence of the popular classes against the reactionary forces.
In Italy, Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist regime used the term &quot;anti-fascist&quot; to describe its opponents. Mussolini&#x27;s secret police was officially known as the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism. During the 1920s in the Kingdom of Italy, anti-fascists, many of them from the labor movement, fought against the violent Blackshirts and against the rise of the fascist leader Benito Mussolini. After the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) signed a pacification pact with Mussolini and his Fasces of Combat on 3 August 1921, and trade unions adopted a legalist and pacified strategy, members of the workers&#x27; movement who disagreed with this strategy formed &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot;.

The Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGL) and the PSI refused to officially recognize the anti-fascist militia and maintained a non-violent, legalist strategy, while the Communist Party of Italy (PCd&#x27;I) ordered its members to quit the organization. The PCd&#x27;I organized some militant groups, but their actions were relatively minor. The Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, who exiled himself to Argentina following the 1922 March on Rome, organized several bombings against the Italian fascist community. The Italian liberal anti-fascist Benedetto Croce wrote his &quot;Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals&quot;, which was published in 1925. Other notable Italian liberal anti-fascists around that time were Piero Gobetti and Carlo Rosselli.
After the murder of the socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti (1924) and the decisive assumption of responsibility by Mussolini, the process of totalitarianization of the State began in the Kingdom of Italy, which will give rise to ever greater control and severe persecution of opponents, at risk of imprisonment and confinement.

The anti-fascists therefore organized themselves clandestinely in Italy and abroad, creating with great difficulty a rudimentary network of connections, which however did not produce significant practical results, remaining fragmented into small uncoordinated groups, incapable of attacking or threatening the regime, if some attacks carried out in particular by anarchists are excluded. Their activity was limited to the ideological side; the production of writings was copious, particularly among the anti-fascist exile communities, which however did not reach the masses and did not influence public opinion.

Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana (), officially known as Concentrazione d&#x27;Azione Antifascista (Anti-Fascist Action Concentration), was an Italian coalition of Anti-Fascist groups which existed from 1927 to 1934. Founded in Nérac, France, by expatriate Italians, the CAI was an alliance of non-communist anti-fascist forces (republican, socialist, nationalist) trying to promote and to coordinate expatriate actions to fight fascism in Italy; they published a propaganda paper entitled &quot;La Libertà&quot;.
Giustizia e Libertà () was an Italian anti-fascist resistance movement, active from 1929 to 1945. The movement was cofounded by Carlo Rosselli, Ferruccio Parri, who later became Prime Minister of Italy, and Sandro Pertini, who became President of Italy, were among the movement&#x27;s leaders. The movement&#x27;s members held various political beliefs but shared a belief in active, effective opposition to fascism, compared to the older Italian anti-fascist parties. &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot; also made the international community aware of the realities of fascism in Italy, thanks to the work of Gaetano Salvemini.

Some historians have also underlined how the Resistance movement may have had links with the Spanish Civil War, in particular with those who had served in the International Brigades. Many Italian anti-fascists participated in the Spanish Civil War with the hope of setting an example of armed resistance to Franco&#x27;s dictatorship against Mussolini&#x27;s regime; hence their motto: &quot;Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy&quot;.

== Resistance by the Italian Armed Forces ==
=== In Italy ===
==== Rome ====

Armed resistance to the German occupation following the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces of 3 September 1943 partially began with Italian regular forces: the Italian Armed Forces and the Carabinieri military police. The period&#x27;s best-known battle broke out in Rome the day the armistice was announced. Regio Esercito units such as the Sassari Division, the Granatieri di Sardegna, the Piave Division, the Ariete II Division, the Centauro Division, the Piacenza Division and the &quot;Lupi di Toscana&quot; Division (in addition to Carabinieri, infantry and coastal artillery regiments) were deployed around the city and along surrounding roads.

Outnumbered German Fallschirmjäger and Panzergrenadiere were initially repelled and endured losses, but slowly gained the upper hand, aided by their experience and superior Panzer component. The defenders were hampered by a number of facts: Allied support was cancelled at the last minute since the Fallschirmjäger took the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division drop zones (Brigadier General Maxwell D. Taylor had crossed enemy lines and gone to Rome to personally supervise the operation); King Victor Emmanuel III, Marshal Pietro Badoglio and their staff fled to Brindisi, which left the generals in charge of the city without a coordinated defence plan; also the absence of the Italian Centauro II Division, composed primarily of ex-Blackshirts and not trusted, with its German-made tanks, contributed to the defeat of the Italian forces by the Germans.

By 10 September, the Germans had penetrated downtown Rome and the Granatieri (aided by civilians) made their last stand at Porta San Paolo. At 4 pm, General Giorgio Calvi di Bergolo signed the order of surrender; the Italian divisions were disbanded and their troops taken prisoner. Although some officers participating in the battle later joined the resistance, the clash in Rome was not motivated by anti-German sentiment so much as the desire to control the Italian capital and resist the disarmament of Italian soldiers. Generals Raffaele Cadorna Jr. (commander of Ariete II) and Giuseppe Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo (later executed by the Germans) joined the underground; General Gioacchino Solinas (commander of the Granatieri) instead opted for the pro-German Italian Social Republic.

==== Piombino ====
One of the most important episodes of resistance by Italian Armed Forces after the armistice was the Battle of Piombino in Tuscany. On 10 September 1943, during Operation Achse, a small German flotilla, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Karl-Wolf Albrand, tried to enter the harbour of Piombino but was denied access by the port authorities. General and Fascist official Cesare Maria De Vecchi in command of the Italian 215th Coastal Division ordered the port authorities to allow the German flotilla to enter, against the advice of Commander Amedeo Capuano, the Naval commander of the harbour. Once they entered and landed, the German forces showed a hostile behaviour, and it became clear that their intent was to occupy the town; the local population asked for a resolved reaction by the Italian forces, threatening an insurrection, but the senior Italian commander, general Fortunato Perni, instead ordered his tanks to open fire on the civilians – an order the tankers refused. Meanwhile, De Vecchi forbade any action against the Germans. This however did not stop the protests; some junior officers, acting on their own initiative and against the orders (Perni and De Vecchi even tried to dismiss them for this), assumed command and started distributing weapons to the population, and civilian volunteers joined the Italian sailors and soldiers in the defense.

A battle broke out at 21:15 on 10 September, between the German landing forces (who aimed to occupy the town centre) and the Italian coastal batteries, tanks of the XIX Tank Battalion &quot;M&quot;, and civilian population. Italian tanks sank the German torpedo boat &quot;TA11&quot;; Italian artillery also sank seven Marinefährprahme, the péniches &quot;Mainz&quot; and &quot;Meise&quot; (another péniche, &quot;Karin&quot;, was scuttled at the harbour entrance as a blockship) and six Luftwaffe service boats (&quot;Fl.B.429&quot;, &quot;Fl.B.538&quot;, &quot;Fl.C.3046&quot;, &quot;Fl.C.3099&quot;, &quot;Fl.C.504&quot; e &quot;Fl.C.528&quot;), and heavily damaged the torpedo boat &quot;TA9&quot; and the steamers &quot;Carbet&quot; and &quot;Capitano Sauro&quot; (former Italian ships). &quot;Sauro&quot; and &quot;Carbet&quot; were scuttled because of the damage they had suffered. The German attack was repelled; by the dawn of 11 September, 120 Germans had been killed and about 200–300 captured, 120 of them wounded. Italian casualties had been 4 killed (two sailors, one Guardia di Finanza brigadier, and one civilian) and a dozen wounded; four Italian submarine chasers (&quot;VAS 208&quot;, &quot;214&quot;, &quot;219&quot; and &quot;220&quot;) were also sunk during the fighting. Later in the morning, however, De Vecchi ordered the prisoners to be released and had their weapons returned to them. New popular protests broke out, as the Italian units were disbanded and the senior commanders fled from the city; the divisional command surrendered Piombino to the Germans on 12 September, and the city was occupied. Many of the sailors, soldiers and citizens who had fought in the battle of Piombino retreated to the surrounding woods and formed the first partisan formations in the area. For the deeds of its citizens, the town received a gold medal for Military Valour from the President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.

=== Outside Italy ===
In the days following 8 September 1943 most servicemen, left without orders from higher echelons (due to Wehrmacht units ceasing Italian radio communications), were disarmed and shipped to POW camps in the Third Reich (often by smaller German outfits). However, some garrisons stationed in occupied Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia and Italy fought the Germans. Admirals Inigo Campioni and Luigi Mascherpa led an attempt to defend Rhodes, Kos, Leros and other Dodecanese islands from their former allies. With reinforcements from SAS, SBS and British Army troops under the command of Generals Francis Gerrard Russell Brittorous and Robert Tilney, the defenders held on for a month. However, the Wehrmacht took the islands through air and sea landings by infantry and Fallschirmjäger supported by the Luftwaffe. Both Campioni and Mascherpa were captured and executed at Verona for high treason.

On 13 September 1943, the Acqui Division stationed in Cefalonia chose to defend themselves from a German invasion during ongoing negotiations. After a ten-day battle, the Germans executed 5,155 officers and enlisted men in retaliation. Those killed in the massacre of the Acqui Division included division commander General Antonio Gandin. On 1 March 2001, the President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi visited Cefalonia, giving a speech underlining how &quot;their conscious choice [of the Acqui Division] was the first act of the &quot;Resistenza&quot;, of an Italy free from fascism&quot;.

Other Italian forces remained trapped in Yugoslavia following the armistice and some decided to fight alongside the local resistance. Elements of the Taurinense Division, the Venezia Division, the Aosta Division and the Emilia Division were assembled in the Italian Garibaldi Partisan Division, part of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Liberation Army. When the unit finally returned to Italy at the end of the war, half its members had been killed or were listed as missing in action.

On 9 September 1943, Bastia, in Corsica, was the setting of a naval battle between Italian torpedo boats and an attacking German flotilla. It was one of the few successful Italian reactions to Operation Achse, and one of the first acts of resistance by the Italian armed forces against Nazi Germany after the armistice of Cassibile.

=== Italian military internees ===

Italian soldiers captured by the Germans numbered around 650,000–700,000 (some 45,000 others were killed in combat, executed, or died during transport), of whom between 40,000 and 50,000 later died in the camps. Most refused cooperation with the Third Reich despite hardship, chiefly to maintain their oath of fidelity to the King. Their former allies designated them &quot;Italienische Militär-Internierte&quot; (&quot;Italian military internees&quot;) to deny them prisoner of war status and the rights granted by the Geneva Convention. Their actions were eventually recognized as an act of unarmed resistance on a par with the armed confrontation of other Italian servicemen.

After disarmament by the Germans, the Italian soldiers and officers were confronted with the choice to continue fighting as allies of the German army (either in the armed forces of the Italian Social Republic, the German puppet regime in northern Italy led by Mussolini, or in Italian &quot;volunteer&quot; units in the German armed forces) or, otherwise, be sent to detention camps in Germany. Those soldiers and officials who refused to recognize the &quot;republic&quot; led by Mussolini were taken as civilian prisoners too. Only 10 percent agreed to enroll.

The Nazis considered the Italians as traitors and not as prisoners of war. The former Italian soldiers were sent into forced labour in war industries (35.6%), heavy industry (7.1%), mining (28.5%), construction (5.9%) and agriculture (14.3%). The working conditions were very poor. The Italians were inadequately fed or clothed for the German winter. Many became sick and died. The death rate of the military internees at 6-7% was second only to that of Soviet prisoners of war although much lower.

==Resistance by Italian partisans ==


In the first major act of resistance following the German occupation, Italian partisans and local resistance fighters liberated the city of Naples through a chaotic popular rebellion. Naples was the first of the major European cities to rise up against the German occupation, and successfully at that. The people of Naples revolted and held strong against Nazi occupiers in the last days of September 1943. The popular mass uprising and resistance in Naples against the occupying Nazi German forces, known as the Four days of Naples, consisted of four days of continuous open warfare and guerrilla actions by locals against the Nazi Germans. The spontaneous uprising of Neopolitan and Italian Resistance against German occupying forces (despite limited armament, organization, or planning) nevertheless successfully disrupted German plans to deport Neopolitans en masse, destroy the city, and prevent Allied forces from gaining a strategic foothold.

Elsewhere, the nascent movement began as independently operating groups were organized and led by previously outlawed political parties or by former officers of the Royal Italian Army. Many partisan formations were initially founded by soldiers from disbanded units of the Royal Italian Army that had evaded capture in Operation Achse, and were led by junior Army officers who had decided to resist the German occupation; they were subsequently joined and re-organized by Anti-Fascists, and became thus increasingly politicized.

Later the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale (Committee of National Liberation, or CLN), created by the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, the Partito d&#x27;Azione (a republican liberal socialist party), Democrazia Cristiana and other minor parties, largely took control of the movement in accordance with King Victor Emmanuel III&#x27;s ministers and the Allies. The CLN was set up by partisans behind German lines and had the support of most groups in the region.
The main CLN formations included three politically varied groups: the communist &quot;Brigate Garibaldi&quot; (Garibaldi Brigades), the &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot; (Justice and Freedom) Brigades related to the Partito d&#x27;Azione, and the socialist &quot;Brigate Matteotti&quot; (Matteotti Brigades). Smaller groups included Christian democrats and, outside the CLN, monarchists such as the &quot;Brigate Fiamme Verdi&quot; (Green Flame Brigades) and &quot;Fronte Militare Clandestino&quot; (Clandestine Military Front) headed by Colonel Montezemolo. Another sizeable partisan group, particularly strong in Piedmont (where the Fourth Army had disintegrated in September 1943), were the &quot;autonomous&quot; (&quot;autonomi&quot;) partisans, largely composed of former soldiers with no substantial alignment to any anti-Fascist party; an example was the &quot;1° Gruppo Divisioni Alpine&quot; led by Enrico Martini.

Relations among the groups varied. For example, in 1945, the Garibaldi partisans under Yugoslav Partisan command attacked and killed several partisans of the Catholic and &quot;azionista&quot; Osoppo groups in the province of Udine. Tensions between the Catholics and the Communists in the movement led to the foundation of the &quot;Fiamme Verdi&quot; as a separate formation.

A further challenge to the &#x27;national unity&#x27; embodied in the CLN came from anarchists as well as dissident-communist Resistance formations, such as Turin&#x27;s &quot;Stella Rossa&quot; movement and the &quot;Movimento Comunista d&#x27;Italia&quot; (Rome&#x27;s largest single anti-fascist force under Occupation), which sought a revolutionary outcome to the conflict and were thus unwilling to collaborate with &#x27;bourgeois parties&#x27;.

=== Partisan movement ===

Rodolfo Graziani estimated the partisan strength at around 70,000–80,000 by May 1944. Some 41% in the Garibaldi Brigades and 29% were Actionists of the &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot; Brigades. One of the strongest units, the 8th Garibaldi Brigade, had 8,050 men (450 without arms) and operated in the Romagna area. The CLN mostly operated in the Alpine area, Apennine area and Po Valley of the RSI, and also in the German &quot;OZAK&quot; (the area northeast of the north end of the Adriatic Sea) and &quot;OZAV&quot; (Trentino and South Tyrol) zones. Its losses amounted to 16,000 killed, wounded or captured between September 1943 and May 1944. On 15 June 1944, the General Staff of the &quot;Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano&quot; estimated that the partisan forces amounted to some 82,000 men, of whom about 25,000 operated in Piedmont, 14,200 in Liguria, 16,000 in the Julian March, 17,000 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna, 5,600 in Veneto, and 5,000 in Lombardy. Their ranks were gradually increased by the influx of young men escaping the Italian Social Republic&#x27;s draft, as well as from deserters from the RSI armed forces. By August 1944, the number of partisans had grown to 100,000, and it escalated to more than 250,000 with the final insurrection in April 1945. The Italian resistance suffered 50,000 fighters killed throughout the conflict.

Partisan unit sizes varied, depending on logistics (such as the ability to arm, clothe and feed members) and the amount of local support. The basic unit was the &quot;squadra&quot; (squad), with three or more squads (usually five) forming a &quot;distaccamento&quot; (detachment). Three or more detachments made a &quot;brigata&quot; (brigade), of which two or more made a &quot;divisione&quot; (division). In some places, several divisions formed a &quot;gruppo divisione&quot; (divisional group). These divisional groups were responsible for a &quot;zona d&#x27;operazione&quot; (operational group).

While the largest contingents operated in mountainous districts of the Alps and the Apennine Mountains, other large formations fought in the Po River flatland. In the large towns of northern Italy, such as Piacenza, and the surrounding valleys near the Gothic Line. Montechino Castle housed a key partisan headquarters. The &quot;Gruppi di Azione Patriottica&quot; (GAP; &quot;Patriotic Action Groups&quot;) commanded by the Resistance&#x27;s youngest officer, Giuseppe &quot;Beppe&quot; Ruffino, carried out acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare, and the &quot;Squadre di Azione Patriottica&quot; (SAP; &quot;Patriotic Action Squads&quot;) arranged strike actions and propaganda campaigns. As in the French Resistance, women were often important members and couriers.

Like their counterparts elsewhere in Europe, Italian partisans seized whatever arms they could find. The first weapons were brought by ex-soldiers fighting German occupiers from the Regio Esercito inventory: Carcano rifles, Beretta M1934 and M1935 pistols, Bodeo M1889 revolvers, SRCM and OTO hand grenades, and Fiat–Revelli Modello 1935, Breda 30 and Breda M37 machine guns. Later, captured K98ks, MG 34s, MG 42s, the iconic potato-masher grenades, Lugers, and Walther P38s were added to partisan kits. Submachine guns (such as the MP 40) were initially scarce, and usually reserved for squad leaders.

Automatic weapons became more common as they were captured in combat and as the Social Republic regime soldiers began defecting, bringing their own guns. Beretta MABs began appearing in larger numbers in October 1943, when they were spirited away &quot;en masse&quot; from the Beretta factory which was producing them for the Wehrmacht. Additional weapons (chiefly of British origin) were airdropped by the Allies: PIATs, Lee–Enfield rifles, Bren light machine guns and Sten guns. U.S.-made weapons were provided on a smaller scale from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS): Thompson submachine guns (both M1928 and M1), M3 submachine guns, United Defense M42s, and folding-stock M1 carbines. Other supplies included explosives, clothing, boots, food rations, and money (used to buy weapons or to compensate civilians for confiscations).

=== Countryside ===
The worst conditions and fighting took place in mountainous regions. Resources were scarce and living conditions were terrible. Due to limited supplies, the resistance adopted guerrilla warfare. This involved groups of 40–50 fighters ambushing and harassing the Nazis and their allies. The size of the brigades was reflective of the resources available to the partisans. Resource limits could not support large groups in one area. Mobility was key to their success. Their terrain knowledge enabled narrow escapes in small groups when nearly surrounded by the Germans. The partisans had no permanent headquarters or bases, making them difficult to destroy.

The resistance fighters themselves relied heavily on the local populace for support and supplies. They would often barter or just ask for food, blankets and medicine. When the partisans took supplies from families, they would often hand out promissory notes that the peasants could convert after the war for money. The partisans slept in abandoned farms and farmhouses. One account from Paolino &#x27;Andrea&#x27; Ranieri (a political commissar at the time) described fighters using donkeys to move equipment at night while during the day the peasants used them in the fields. The Nazis tried to split the populace from the resistance by adopting a reprisal policy of killing 10 Italians for every German killed by the Partisans. Those executed would come from the village near where an attack took place and sometimes from captive partisan fighters.

The German punishments backfired and instead strengthened the relationship. Because most resistance fighters were peasants, local populations felt a need to provide for their own. One of the larger engagements was the battle for Monte Battaglia (lit. &quot;Battle Mountain&quot;), a mountaintop that was a part of the Gothic Line. On September 26, 1944, a joint force of 250 Partisans and three companies of U.S. soldiers from the 88th Infantry Division attacked the hill occupied by elements of the German 290th Grenadier Regiment. The Germans were caught completely by surprise. The attackers captured the hill and held it for five days against reinforced German units, securing a path for the Allied advance.

=== Urban areas ===
Resistance activities were different in the cities. Some Italians ignored the struggle, while others organized, such as the Patriotic Action Squads and issued propaganda. Groups such as the Patriotic Action Groups carried out military actions. A more expansive support network was devised than in the countryside. Networks of safe houses were established to hide weapons and wounded fighters. Only sympathizers were involved, because compulsion was thought to encourage betrayal. People largely supported the resistance because of economic hardships, especially inflation. Pasta prices tripled and bread prices had quintupled since 1938; hunger unified the underground and general population.

=== Female partisans ===
Women played a large role. After the war, about 35,000 Italian women were recognised as female &quot;partigiane combattenti&quot; (partisan combatants) and 20,000 as &quot;patriote&quot; (patriots); they broke into these groups based on their activities. The majority were between 20 and 29. They were generally kept separate from male partisans. Few were attached to brigades and were even rarer in mountain brigades. Female countryside volunteers were generally rejected. Women still served in large numbers and had significant influence.

The groups were formed collaboratively by women from diverse political backgrounds. Prominent participants included communists Giovanna Barcellona, Lina Fibbi, Marisa Diena, and Caterina Picolato; socialists Laura Conti and Lina Merlin; actionists Elena Dreher and Ada Gobetti; as well as women associated with the Giustizia e Libertà (Justice and Freedom) movement. Republican and Catholic women, along with those without prior political or ideological commitments, also joined. These groups predominantly operated in the northern midlands of Italy. Scholars attribute this geographic spread to the influence of local women&#x27;s clothing, which fostered individual initiative and civic awareness.

Initially, the women&#x27;s groups aimed to support resistance efforts in auxiliary roles. However, they quickly assumed leadership responsibilities in areas such as information dissemination, propaganda, issuing orders, and handling ammunition. Some women even directly engaged in armed resistance as &quot;gappistas&quot;. Ada Gobetti was among the first to criticize the use of the term &quot;assistance&quot; in the group&#x27;s name. In 1944, the organization&#x27;s objectives were reformulated to prioritize activities that broadly promoted women&#x27;s emancipation.

=== 1944 uprising ===

During the summer and early fall of 1944, with Allied forces nearby, partisans attacked behind German lines, led by CLNAI. This rebellion led to provisional partisan governments throughout the mountainous regions. Ossola was the most important of these, receiving recognition from Switzerland and Allied consulates there. An intelligence officer told Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, Germany&#x27;s commander of occupation forces in Italy, that he estimated German casualties fighting partisans in the summer of 1944 amounted to 30,000 to 35,000, including 5,000 confirmed killed. Kesselring considered the number to be exaggerated, and offered his own figure of 20,000: 5,000 killed, between 7,000 and 8,000 missing / &quot;kidnapped&quot; (including deserters), and a similar number seriously wounded. Both sources agreed that partisan losses were less. By the end of the year, German reinforcements and Mussolini&#x27;s remaining forces crushed the uprising.

In their attempts to suppress the resistance, German and Italian Fascist forces (especially the SS, Gestapo, and paramilitary militias such as Xª MAS and Black Brigades) committed war crimes, including summary executions and systematic reprisals against the civilian population. Resistance captives and suspects were often tortured and raped. Some of the most notorious mass atrocities included the Ardeatine massacre (335 Jewish civilians and political prisoners executed without a trial in a reprisal operation after a resistance bomb attack in Rome), the Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema massacre (about 560 random villagers brutally killed in an anti-partisan operation in the central mountains), the Marzabotto massacre (about 770 civilians killed in similar circumstances), the Ossola massacre (24 partisans murdered during their retreat from Croveo to Switzerland) and the Salussola massacre (20 partisans murdered after being tortured, as a reprisal). In all, an estimated 15,000 Italian civilians were deliberately killed, including many women and children.

===Civil war===

Although other European countries such as Norway, the Netherlands, and France also had partisan movements and collaborationist governments with Nazi Germany, armed confrontation between compatriots was more intense in Italy, making the Italian case unique. In 1965, the definition of &quot;civil war&quot; was used for the first time by fascist politician and historian Giorgio Pisanò in his books, while Claudio Pavone&#x27;s book &quot;Una guerra civile. Saggio storico sulla moralità della Resistenza&quot; (&quot;A Civil War. Historical Essay On the Morality Of the Resistance&quot;), published in 1991, led to the term &quot;Italian Civil War&quot; being used more frequently by Italian and international historiography.

=== Foreign contribution ===
Not all resistance members were Italians; many foreigners had escaped POW camps or joined guerrilla bands as so-called &quot;military missions&quot;. Among them were Yugoslavs, Czechs (deserters from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia army, in Italy for guard/patrol duty in 1944), Russians, Ukrainians, Dutch, Spaniards, Greeks, Poles, German defectors and deserters disillusioned with Nazism and Britons and Americans (ex-prisoners or advisors deployed by the SAS, SOE and OSS). Some later became well-known, such as climber and explorer Bill Tilman, reporter and historian Peter Tompkins, former RAF pilot Count Manfred Beckett Czernin, and architect Oliver Churchill. George Dunning recorded his experiences of fighting with the partisans in his book &quot;Where bleed the many&quot;.

=== Aid networks ===
Another task carried out by the resistance was assisting escaping POWs (an estimated 80,000 were interned in Italy until 8 September 1943), to reach Allied lines or Switzerland on paths previously used by smugglers. Some fugitives and groups of fugitives hid in safe houses, usually arranged by women (less likely to arouse suspicion). After the war, Field Marshal Harold Alexander issued a certificate to those who thereby risked their lives.

Italian Jews were aided by DELASEM, a network extending throughout occupied Italy that included Jews and Gentiles, Roman Catholic clergy, faithful/sympathetic police officers and even some German soldiers. DELASEM operated in Rome until the liberation under the leadership of the Jewish delegates Septimius Sorani, Giuseppe Levi, and the Capuchin Father Maria Benedetto. Since Jews were considered &quot;enemy aliens&quot; by the Social Republic regime, they were left with little or nothing to live on, and many were deported to Nazi concentration and extermination camps where about 7,000 died. DELASEM helped thousands of Jews by offering food, shelter and money. Some of its members would later be designated Righteous Among the Nations.

=== 1945 uprising ===

On 19 April 1945, the CLN called for an insurrection (the April 25 uprising). In Bologna, the occupying Nazi German forces and their few remaining Italian Fascist allies were openly attacked by Italian partisans on 19 April, and by 21 April, the city of Bologna was liberated by the partisans, the Italian Co-Belligerent Army, and the Polish II Corps under Allied command; Parma and Reggio Emilia were later freed on 24 April by the Italian Resistance and then the advancing Allied forces. Turin and Milan were liberated on 25 April through a popular revolt and Italian Resistance insurrection following a general strike that commenced two days earlier; over 14,000 German and Fascist troops were captured in Genoa on 26–27 April, when General Günther Meinhold surrendered to the CLN. The forces of German occupation in Italy officially capitulated on 2 May. Fascists attempted to continue fighting, but were quickly suppressed by the partisans and the Allied forces.

The April insurrection brought to the fore issues between the resistance and the Allies. Given the revolutionary dimension of the insurrection in the industrial centres of Turin, Milan, and Genoa, where concerted factory occupations by armed workers had occurred, the Allied commanders sought to impose control as soon as they took the place of the retreating Germans. While the Kingdom of Italy was the de facto ruler of the south, the National Liberation Committee, still embedded in German territory, existed as a populist organization which posed a threat to the monarchy and property owners in post-war Italy. However the PCI, under directives from Moscow, enabled the Allies to carry out their program of disarming the partisans and discouraged any revolutionary attempt at changing the social system. Instead, the PCI emphasized national unity and &quot;progressive democracy&quot; in order to stake their claim in the post-war political situation. Despite the pressing need to resolve social issues which persisted after the fall of fascism, the resistance movement was subordinated to the interests of Allied leaders in order to maintain the status quo.

=== Revenge killings ===
A score-settling campaign () ensued against pro-German collaborators, thousands of whom were rounded up by the vengeful partisans. Controversially, many of those detainees were speedily court martialed, condemned and shot, or killed without trial. Minister of Interior Mario Scelba later put the number of the victims of such executions at 732, but other estimates were much higher. Partisan leader Ferruccio Parri, who briefly served as Prime Minister after the war in 1945, said thousands were killed. Some partisans, such as perpetrators of the Schio massacre, were tried by an Allied Military Court.

During the waning hours of the war, Mussolini, accompanied by Marshal Graziani, headed to Milan to meet with Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster. Mussolini was hoping to negotiate a deal but was given only the option of unconditional surrender. His negotiations were an act of betrayal against the Germans. When confronted about this by Achille Marazza, Mussolini said, &quot;They [the Nazis] have always treated us as slaves. I will now resume my freedom of action.&quot; With the city already held by resistance fighters, Mussolini used his connections one last time to secure passage with an escaping German convoy on its way to the Brenner Pass with his mistress Claretta Petacci. 
On the morning of 27 April 1945, Umberto Lazzaro (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; &#x27;Partisan Bill&#x27;), a partisan with the 52nd Garibaldi Brigade, was checking a column of lorries carrying retreating SS troops at Dongo, Lombardy, near the Swiss border. Lazzaro recognized and arrested Mussolini. The task of executing Mussolini was, according to the official version, given to a &#x27;Colonel Valerio&#x27; (identified as Walter Audisio) and the bodies of Mussolini and Petacci were later brought to Milan and hung upside down in the Piazzale Loreto square. Eighteen executed prominent Fascists (including Mussolini, Fernando Mezzasoma, Luigi Gatti, Alessandro Pavolini and Achille Starace) were displayed in the square; this place was significant because the bodies of 15 executed enemies of Mussolini&#x27;s regime had been displayed in this square the previous year.

The total number of victims of the anti-fascist movement remains unclear; it is estimated that between 12,000 and 26,000 people were killed, usually in extrajudicial executions. The outburst was particularly violent in the northern provinces; according to statistics provided by the Ministry of Interior, some 9,000 people were killed there during April and May 1945 only. Proportionally, the scale of vengeance killings was much greater than in Belgium and significantly above that recorded in France.

Some historians who have dealt with the civil war in Italy have also taken into consideration the phenomenon of post-war violence, placing the end of the civil war beyond the official end of the Second World War in Europe. Therefore, for them, it is not easy to identify a real end date of the phenomenon, which slowly faded away. Some have proposed the Togliatti amnesty of 22 June 1946 as the end of the civil war.

=== Casualties ===
According to a book published in 1955 by an Italian ministerial committee on the tenth anniversary of the Liberation, casualties in Italy among the Resistance movement amounted to 35,828 partisans killed in action or executed, and 21,168 partisans mutilated or left disabled by their wounds. Another 32,000 Italian partisans had been killed abroad (in the Balkans and, to a lesser extent, in France). 9,980 Italian civilians had been killed in reprisals by the German and Fascist forces. In 2010, the &quot;Ufficio dell&#x27;Albo d&#x27;Oro&quot; of the Italian Ministry of Defence recorded 15,197 partisans killed; however, the &quot;Ufficio dell&#x27;Albo d&#x27;Oro&quot; only considered as partisans the members of the Resistance who were civilians before joining the partisans, whereas partisans who were formerly members of the Italian Armed Forces (more than half those killed) were considered as members of their armed force of origin.

=== Liberation Day ===


Since 1946, 25 April has been officially celebrated as Liberation Day, also known as the Anniversary of the Resistance. It is a national holiday that commemorates the victory of the Italian resistance movement against Nazi Germany and the Italian Social Republic, puppet state of the Nazis and rump state of the fascists, during the liberation of Italy and the Italian Civil War during World War II. The date was chosen by convention, as it was the day of the year 1945 when the National Liberation Committee of Upper Italy (CLNAI) – whose command was based in Milan and was chaired by Alfredo Pizzoni, Luigi Longo, Emilio Sereni, Sandro Pertini, and Leo Valiani (present among others the designated president Rodolfo Morandi, Giustino Arpesani, and Achille Marazza) – proclaimed a general insurrection in all the territories still occupied by the Nazi-fascists, indicating to all the partisan forces active in Northern Italy that were part of the Volunteer Corps of Freedom to attack the fascist and German garrisons by imposing the surrender, days before the arrival of the Allied troops. &quot;Surrender or die!&quot; was the rallying call of the partisans that day and those immediately following.

Since then, public events in memory of the event, like marches and parades, have been organized annually in all Italian cities – especially in those decorated with military valour for the war of liberation. Among the events of the festival program, there is the solemn homage, by the President of Italy and other important officers of the State, to the chapel of the Italian Unknown Soldier (&quot;Milite Ignoto&quot;), buried in the Altare della Patria in Rome, with the deposition of a laurel wreath in memory of the fallen and missing Italians in wars. Speaking at the 2014 anniversary, President Giorgio Napolitano said: &quot;The values and merits of the Resistance, from the Partisan movement and the soldiers who sided with the fight for liberation to the Italian armed forces, are indelible and beyond any rhetoric of mythicization or any biased denigration. The Resistance, the commitment to reconquer Italy&#x27;s liberty and independence, was a great civil engine of ideals, but above all, it was a people in arms, a courageous mobilization of young and very young citizens who rebelled against foreign power.&quot;

==Aftermath==

Today&#x27;s Italian constitution is the result of the work of the Constituent Assembly, which was formed by the representatives of all the anti-nazist and anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the Italian resistance and the Liberation of Italy.

&quot;Associazione Nazionale Partigiani d&#x27;Italia&quot; (ANPI; &quot;National Association of Italian Partisans&quot;) is an association founded by participants of the Italian resistance against the Nazi occupation and the fascist and collaborationist Italian Social Republic during the latter phase of World War II. ANPI was founded in Rome in 1944 while the war continued in northern Italy. It was constituted as a charitable foundation on 5 April 1945. It persists due to the activity of its antifascist members. ANPI&#x27;s objectives are the maintenance of the historical role of the partisan war by means of research and the collection of personal stories. Its goals are a continued defence against historical revisionism and the ideal and ethical support of the high values of freedom and democracy expressed in the 1948 constitution, in which the ideals of the Italian resistance were collected. Since 2008, every two years ANPI organizes its national festival. During the event, meetings, debates, and musical concerts that focus on antifascism, peace, and democracy are organized.

&quot;Bella ciao&quot; (; &quot;Goodbye beautiful&quot;) is an Italian folk song modified and adopted as an anthem of the Italian resistance movement by the partisans who opposed Nazism and Fascism, and fought against the invading and occupying forces of Nazi Germany, who were allied with the fascist and collaborationist Italian Social Republic between 1943 and 1945 during the Liberation of Italy from German occupation and during the civil war. Versions of this song continue to be sung worldwide as a hymn of freedom and resistance. As an internationally known hymn of freedom, it was intoned at many historic and revolutionary events. The song originally aligned itself with Italian partisans fighting against Nazi German occupation troops, but has since become to merely stand for the inherent rights of all people to be liberated from tyranny.

<doc id="883443" wikidata="Q279103" url="?curid=883443" title="Pierre De Geyter">
<text>Pierre Chrétien Degeyter (, ; 8 October 1848 – 26 September 1932) was a Belgian-French socialist and a composer, known for writing the music of &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

== Early life ==
Degeyter was born in Ghent, Belgium, where his parents, originally from the French Flanders, had moved to work in the textile factories. When he was seven, the family, who already counted five children, returned to France and settled in Lille. Pierre worked there as a thread maker and learned how to read and write at workers&#x27; evening classes. At age sixteen, he enrolled at the Lille Academy where he first took drawing classes, which allowed him to find a job as a woodcarver. He later took music classes, and joined the workers&#x27; choir &quot;La Lyre des Travailleurs&quot;, founded by the socialist leader of Lille, Gustave Delory.

== &quot;The Internationale&quot; ==

On 15 July 1888, Delory contacted Degeyter to compose music for several &quot;Chants révolutionnaires&quot; that were often sung at popular events with Lille socialists. Among these was a song that was to become the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association anthem, &quot;The Internationale&quot;. The lyrics had been written by Eugène Edine Pottier during the &quot;semaine sanglante&quot; (the &quot;bloody week&quot;, May 22–28, 1871) marking the end and the severe repression of the Paris Commune of 1871. Until then, the song had usually been sung to the tune of the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;.

It took Pierre one Sunday morning to compose his music on a harmonium. According to one source, he then asked his brother Adolphe to play it on the bugle, and subsequently made some minor changes to the music. The new composition was first played by the Lyre des Travailleurs at the yearly fête of the Lille trade union of newspaper sellers in July 1888. Six thousand leaflets were printed at Pierre&#x27;s favorite printing firm, Boldoduc, and sold to raise money for the socialist party in Lille. To protect his job, only «De Geyter&quot; was named as the composer but Pierre was dismissed regardless and was subsequently blacklisted by Lille employers. He was soon reduced to performing odd jobs, such as making coffins. In 1902, he left Lille with his wife and daughter and moved to Saint-Denis, near Paris.

In fact, Pierre Degeyter had neglected to secure copyright. As the song became ever more popular, his brother Adolphe Degeyter claimed copyright in 1901 and began to collect royalties on it. Pierre had become estranged from the socialist establishment of Lille by siding with the left-wing opponents of the Bloc National government of 1902, and with the Marxist war opponents influenced by Bolshevism, who would later form the communist party. In 1904, Pierre started court proceedings against Adolphe, but Gustave Delory (mayor of Lille by then) supported Adolphe&#x27;s claim (though in an 1888 meeting with the Ghent socialist leader Edward Anseele he had identified Pierre Degeyter as the author) and, as a result, Pierre was unable to prove his authorship. He lost the case in 1914. At the beginning of 1916, however, during the First World War, Adolphe Degeyter hanged himself, leaving a note for his brother in which he acknowledged his fraud and asserted that he had been pressured by others to make the claim. Pierre, who was in unoccupied France at the time, received the letter only after the war. In 1922, the copyright verdict was reversed.

== Later life ==
In 1927, leaders of the Soviet Union discovered that the real author of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, which was then the Soviet Union&#x27;s national anthem, was still alive. Pierre was invited to Moscow for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution and was in the stands of the honorary guests, with the German sculptor Käthe Kollwitz at his side. Joseph Stalin awarded him a Soviet Union state pension (according to some sources as a compensation for his copyright). As this was Pierre&#x27;s only income, apart from modest fees collected on music for the other Pottier poems (particularly &quot;L&#x27;Insurgé&quot; and &quot;En avant la Classe Ouvrière&quot;) and on popular tunes he had also composed, and although the left-wing town administration of Saint-Denis granted him a free apartment, Pierre Degeyter spent the last years of his life in precarity. After his death at Saint-Denis in 1932, more than fifty thousand people attended his funeral.

== In popular culture ==
After his death, even in France, his name mainly came up during copyright litigation cases. French courts ruled his compositions, including &quot;The Internationale&quot;, copyrighted until October 2017.

There is a Pierre Degeyter street in Ghent and there are Pierre Degeyter squares both in Lille (in Fives, the suburb where he used to live) and in Saint-Denis. Lille also named a procession giant after him. In Sofia (Bulgaria) there is a street Пиер Дегейтър. A bronze monument to Pierre Degeyter has adorned the Ghent MIAT (Museum of Industry, Labour and Textiles) since 1998.

A documentary film on Pierre Degeyter and the story of &quot;The Internationale&quot; was produced in 1978.

<text>The Angry Red Planet (also called Invasion of Mars and Journey to Planet Four) is a 1959 American science-fiction film directed by Ib Melchior and starring Gerald Mohr.

Melchior reportedly had an initial production budget of only $200,000 and was given just nine days to film it. Such financial and time constraints necessitated the use of &quot;CineMagic&quot;, a film-processing technique that combined hand-drawn animations with live-action footage. The relatively inexpensive process was used for all scenes depicting the surface of Mars. While CineMagic proved unsatisfactory for creating visually believable special effects for &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot;, producer Norman Maurer did reuse the process in 1962, although to a lesser extent, in the comedy film &quot;The Three Stooges in Orbit&quot;.

==Plot==
Mission control personnel on Earth monitor the rocket ship &quot;Mars Rocket 1&quot; (MR-1) as it approaches Earth orbit following the first crewed expedition to Mars. Personnel are surprised to see the ship on their monitors, for they believed that the vehicle had become lost or destroyed in space. Ground technicians are unable, though, to make contact with anyone on MR-1, so they guide the rocket by remote control to a safe Nevada landing. Only two survivors of the original four-person crew are found in the ship: Dr. Iris Ryan and Col. Tom O&#x27;Bannion, whose entire right arm is covered with a strange green alien growth. The MR-1&#x27;s mission to Mars is then recounted by Dr. Ryan as she also helps to find a cure for Col. O&#x27;Bannion&#x27;s badly infected arm. In her debriefing, she reports in detail the crew&#x27;s experiences while traveling to the red planet and exploring its surface. She describes their expedition in retrospect, as if it were currently happening.

After MR-1 reaches Mars and its crew explores the planet&#x27;s surface, Dr. Ryan is attacked by a carnivorous plant, which Chief Warrant Officer Jacobs kills with his freeze-ray, which he calls &quot;Cleo&quot;. The crew then encounters an immense creature resembling a rat/bat/spider/crab hybrid, at first mistaking its legs for trees. That creature is also blinded and repelled by Jacobs, who again uses his ray gun. When the crew returns to their ship, they realize that their radio signals are being blocked and the MR-1 is unable to leave Mars due to a mysterious force field.

O&#x27;Bannion next leads the crew to a Martian lake, where a city with high, impressive structures is visible on the other side, far in the distance. Crossing the water in an inflatable raft, they are stopped by a giant amoeba-like creature with a single spinning eye. They hurriedly retreat, the creature pursuing them. As they are entering their ship, the creature catches Jacobs and draws him inside its gelatinous body, soon absorbing him; it has also infected O&#x27;Bannion&#x27;s arm. The creature envelops the ship and is expected to eventually develop acids to eat through it.

O&#x27;Bannion leads them in rewiring the ship to electrify the outer hull, which drives the creature away after destroying parts of it, then they rewire the ship for lift-off. The three survivors manage to lift MR-1 off from the planet, since the force field has somehow been deactivated, but Professor Gettell, the MR-1&#x27;s designer, dies of an apparent heart attack caused by the extreme stresses of the ascent.

Once the MR-1 returns to Earth, O&#x27;Bannion&#x27;s infected arm is cured by medical staff using electric shocks. Mission-control technicians also examine the MR-1&#x27;s data recorders from the expedition and find a recording of an alien voice, which announces that the ship&#x27;s crew was allowed to leave Mars so that they could deliver a message to their home planet. The voice then states, &quot;We of Mars have been observing human development on Earth for many thousands of years and have determined that humanity&#x27;s technology has far outpaced progress in cultural advancement.&quot; The alien then accuses humankind of invading Mars, warning that if future expeditions ever return to the red planet, the Earth would be destroyed in retaliation.

==Production==

&quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; began as &quot;The Planet Mars&quot;, a treatment written by Sidney Pink about a space voyage to Earth&#x27;s mysterious neighbor. Pink said in an interview a few years before his 2002 death: &quot;It was written on my kitchen table. My kids were my critics, they&#x27;d tell me what was good and what just fell flat&quot;. Pink gave his treatment to Melchior after meeting him at a party. Melchior believed the project had potential, so he offered to help write the screenplay if Pink allowed him to direct the film. While Melchior worked on establishing a working script, Pink met Maurer, who was developing CineMagic, a &quot;revolutionary&quot; filming process for creating special effects by combining hand-drawn images with live action. However, it soon became apparent the process would not be able to deliver what had been promised with respect to the quality of its effects. Pink recalled that &quot;the damn Cinemagic didn&#x27;t work like it should. It was supposed to be sort of a 3-D effect. What we came up with was great anyway&quot;.

The production budget for &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; may have actually been significantly higher than the $200,000 cited by most film and press references. In its online catalog, the American Film Institute refers to a contemporary report in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that announced an increase in allotted funding for the project more than double the frequently given figure. AFI states: &quot;As noted in a &quot;HR&quot; news item, just prior to the start of production, the film&#x27;s budget was raised from $250,000 to $500,000&quot;.

Comments made by Pink on the eve of filming provide some evidence regarding how little money was spent to design and build sets for the production. In an interview for a September 7, 1959, news item by &quot;Associated Press&quot; reporter and writer James Bacon, Pink is quoted about the extreme cost-cutting effectiveness of using the new CineMagic process: &quot;Our set for the planet Mars cost us a couple of hundred dollars instead of the thousands we had estimated&quot;. Pink also estimates in that interview that the movie &quot;will be made at half the original cost&quot;, confirming that &quot;Invasion of Mars&quot; (the film&#x27;s working title before its release) was a low-budget project. The &quot;meager&quot; $200,000 production budget cited for &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; may, therefore, be a credible ballpark figure.

Filming for &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; began on September 9, 1959, at Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, only a month after Melchior and Pink completed their final draft of the screenplay.

===CineMagic===
The CineMagic process was used to cast a red glow over scenes depicting the surface of Mars. The low-cost process made the actors look similar to cartoon drawings so they would fit in with low-budget, less realistic sets and props.

To achieve this effect, a black-and-white film negative was first processed with solarisation (a process which partially reverses the negative, making some areas of the image appear positive). The resulting film was then tinted red. Making a film positive was not necessary. At the time &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; was produced, black-and-white film cost less than color film and processing. The combination of using black-and-white film for all scenes depicting Mars and not needing to produce a film positive lowered production costs for the film.

==Release==
American International Pictures released the film in September 1960 with its original running time varying between 83 and 87 minutes. AIP also distributed the film initially as part of double feature billings. At theaters in some regions, it was presented with &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot;, and in other regions, it was presented with &quot;Beyond the Time Barrier&quot;.

According to Pink, he had trouble working with AIP, more specifically with the &quot;notorious&quot; Samuel Z. Arkoff. In a 2005 interview about the release of &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot;, Pink said that &quot;neither of us trusted the other, which worked out well because I wouldn&#x27;t touch him with a 10-foot pole. Jimmy Nicholson was the brains of that operation. With Arkoff, you never got a straight count&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; received mixed reviews upon its release. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Eugene Archer gave the production a negative review, criticizing its depiction of the planet Mars, likening it to &quot;a cardboard illustration from Flash Gordon&quot;. However, not all reviewers in 1959 and early 1960 were critical of the film in general, or in particular, CineMagic&#x27;s deficiencies in simulating the terrain, fictitious plant life, and monstrous creatures on Mars.

&quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; reviewer Samuel D. Berns was enthusiastic at the time about the production, calling it &quot;a stimulating experience in suspense and intrigue&quot;. He describes CineMagic in his review as &quot;a well-conceived optical effect for dramatic impact&quot;, an element of the film that he predicts will draw &quot;big gross business&quot; to the box office. Berns also compliments both forms of filming presented in &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot;, as well as its music:

In his 2001 reassessment of &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot;, Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk criticizes the film&#x27;s flat direction, dull script, and overuse of stock footage. Erickson does faintly compliment the film for at least coloring scenes of Mars&#x27; surface with a red tinge, which in his opinion gives the sequences &quot;a credibly alien look&quot;. In his 2014 movie guide, Leonard Maltin judges the film to be only average, awarding it 2 out of 4 stars. However, reviewer Bruce Eder of AllMovie is more positive in his appraisal of the film, commending in particular its overall style of direction:

==Legacy==
The cover artwork for the 1982 album &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; by the American punk rock band Misfits features the rat-bat-spider creature from &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot;. The creature was also featured briefly in the Iron Maiden music video for &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; was first released on VHS by Thorn EMI/HBO Video. It was later released on VHS and DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 2001, as part of their &quot;Midnite Movies&quot; line of home media releases. A decade later, MGM re-issued the film on DVD as part of the multi-feature &quot;Midnite Movies&quot; single-disc collection, which also includes the 1951 film &quot;The Man from Planet X&quot;, the 1985 film &quot;Morons from Outer Space&quot;, and the 1988 film &quot;Alien from L.A.&quot;. &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; was released yet again in 2013 by Gaiam International on &quot;Sci-Fi Classics&quot;, another four-movie compilation on a single disc, alongside &quot;The Man from Planet X&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Time Barrier&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Time Travelers&quot; (1964).
