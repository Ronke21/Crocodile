<text>Jolanda Batagelj (previously known as Jolanda Čeplak until 2002, born Jolanda Steblovnik on 12 September 1976) is a Slovenian middle distance athlete. She was born in Celje and lived in Velenje until briefly moving to Monaco. She has lived in Celje since.

==Running career==
In her early career, she did not specialise, and ran at many distances. She later settled on the 800 metres where she found relative success on the IAAF Golden League circuit, despite having to compete against Maria de Lurdes Mutola, who went unbeaten at all major championships from 1999 until the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Her most successful season was 2002. On 2 March at the European Indoor Championships in Vienna she beat local favourite Stephanie Graf and set the indoor world record at 1:55.82. In the same year at the European Championships in Munich she became the European champion.

At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Čeplak finished very strongly in the 800 m but could not quite catch winner Kelly Holmes and finished with exactly the same time as Hasna Benhassi. A photo-finish showed her in third-place, winning the bronze medal.

===PED use and suspension===

On 18 June 2007, Čeplak tested positive on erythropoietin. On 26 July, IAAF announced that the B test confirmed the result of the A test. Čeplak said that she has never taken any illegal substances and would try to prove her innocence with all means possible. She received a two-year suspension, and returned to competition in July 2009.

==Personal life==

After a divorce from Aleš Čeplak in 2007, she married triple jumper Andrej Batagelj from Nova Gorica in 2009. They live in Celje.

<text>Francis Fox (December 2, 1939 – September 24, 2024) was a Canadian politician who was a member of the Senate, Cabinet minister, and Principal Secretary in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, and thus was a senior aide to Prime Minister Paul Martin. He also worked as a lobbyist in the 1980s.

==Life and career==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Fox was a lawyer by training. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 election as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Argenteuil—Deux-Montagnes, Quebec. He was re-elected in the 1974 election from the same constituency. In the 1979 and 1980 elections, he was returned as MP for Blainville—Deux-Montagnes before being defeated in that riding in the 1984 election.

Fox was appointed to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1976 when he became Solicitor General of Canada. Bilingual, Fox was seen as an up-and-comer in the Liberal cabinet, and even a potential party leader. However, he was forced to resign on January 27, 1978, when it became known that he had forged the signature of his lover&#x27;s husband on a form granting permission for her to have an abortion. Although he was married at the time of the scandal, he subsequently divorced his wife (m. 1965), Joan Pennefather. He later married a subsequent lover, Vivian Case (b. 1950). He was until his death married (~1979) to Case, who is a visual artist, and had three children.

Fox returned to Cabinet after the 1980 election when Trudeau appointed him to the position of Secretary of State for Canada and Minister of Communications. He then served as Minister of International Trade in 1984 in the short-lived government of Trudeau&#x27;s successor, John Turner.

With the defeat of the Turner government and the loss of his own seat, Fox returned to the private sector. He became a lobbyist and a member of Government Consultants International, a consulting firm, with Frank Moores, Gary Ouellet, and Gerald Doucet. Subsequently, he was a senior partner in the law firm of Martineau Walker, and later as an executive at Rogers AT&amp;T Wireless.

In 2003, Fox became a senior member of Paul Martin&#x27;s transition team as he prepared to succeed Jean Chrétien as prime minister. In 2004, Fox became Martin&#x27;s principal secretary, but it was announced on August 18 that he would be leaving the position on October 1 to return to private life.

After resigning, Fox served as the president of former cabinet minister Liza Frulla&#x27;s riding. He was an early prominent supporter of former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff.

Fox was appointed to the Senate on Martin&#x27;s recommendation on August 29, 2005, and announced his resignation on November 30, 2011, effective December 2.

Fox died on September 24, 2024, at the age of 84.

<doc id="879698" wikidata="Q3776729" url="?curid=879698" title="Grifter (character)">
<text>Grifter (Cole Cash) is a superhero appearing in books published by Wildstorm Productions and DC Comics. Created by artist Jim Lee and writer Brandon Choi, he first appeared in &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; #1 (August 1992), as a member of that titular superhero team, during the period when Wildstorm and its properties were owned by Jim Lee. In that incarnation, Grifter is a former government operative and member of the military unit Team 7 and the espionage agency International Operations.

In 1999, Lee sold Wildstorm to DC Comics, and ownership of all Wildstorm characters, including Grifter, transferred to DC Comics. His history and continuity remained the same however, until DC&#x27;s 2011 relaunch of their entire comics line, The New 52, which rebooted the continuity for most of its characters. Since then, the character has starred in his own DC series, and has also made appearances in numerous other DC titles, such as &quot;Voodoo&quot;, &quot;Legion Lost&quot;, &quot;Team 7&quot;, &quot;Animal Man&quot; and &quot;Deathstroke&quot;.

The character has been voiced by Colin O&#x27;Meara in &quot;Wild C.A.T.s&quot;, and Danny Jacobs in &quot;Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox&quot;.

==Publication history==
The character debuted in &quot;WildC.A.T.S.&quot; #1 (August 1992). He was later a major character in the original &quot;Team 7&quot; miniseries. In 1997, co-creator Brandon Choi picked this mini-series as his favorite Grifter story, explaining, &quot;I really enjoyed [writer] Chuck Dixon&#x27;s portrayal of the team members, especially Cole. He really wove Cole&#x27;s background into the whole Team 7 story in a very believable fashion.&quot; *

In May 1995, the character starred in his own solo series, which was concluded in March 1996 with a total of ten issues. A second solo series ran from July 1996 to August 1997, with a total of 14 issues. 
The character also starred in the five-issue mini-series &quot;Point Blank.&quot;

In June 2011, DC Comics announced that Grifter would be incorporated into the DC Universe in a new ongoing series written by Nathan Edmondson and drawn by CAFU as part of its September 2011 relaunch of its comics properties. Beginning with &quot;Grifter&quot; #9 in May 2012, series writer Nathan Edmondson was replaced with Rob Liefeld. The title concluded in issue #16.

==Fictional character biography==
===Team 7===
From a young age, Cole Cash took part in his con man father Jacob Winston &quot;Win&quot; Cash&#x27;s various grifts, until Cole witnessed his father&#x27;s apparent murder at the hands of mobster Sam Del Gracci. Cole&#x27;s mother went on to marry Del Gracci, who regularly beat Cole, while also doting on Cole&#x27;s younger brother Max. As a teenager, Cole ran away from home and became the getaway driver for a crew of robbers. When his fellow criminals turned violent, Cole intervened, saving the life of F.B.I. agent Joseph Brockmeyer. He was apprehended, and Brockmeyer gave him the choice of either joining the clandestine agency known as International Operations or go to jail. Cole joined I.O., and received training from future Team 7 teammate Marc Slayton (who would eventually become the hero known as Backlash), as well as former members of I.O.&#x27;s previous covert operations team, Team 6. At some point, Cole may have been a part of the Army&#x27;s Special Forces.

Cole joined Team 7, being given the codename &quot;Deadeye&quot;. The group was deliberately exposed to an experimental chemical called the Gen Factor, which activated a variety of psi powers in them, but which also detrimentally affected their mental health. After the experiment the survivors were classified as Gen 12. Cole suspected that, in fact, high-ranking I.O. officers were behind the experiment, while they claimed that it was an unknown chemical weapon. Cole grew more and more disgruntled with I.O.&#x27;s manipulations and secrecy and rebelled against teammates John Lynch and Slayton, particularly after Slayton killed an innocent scientist Cole had tried to rescue during a mission in Leningrad, which Slayton had done on their I.O. superiors&#x27; orders.

Most of Team 7 quit I.O. and went into hiding after they became aware that Craven was interested in using their children, the Gen13, who were believed to have inherited their fathers&#x27; powers, as weapons.

Cole struck out on his own, eventually crossing paths with the ancient Kherubim warrior Zealot. They fell in love, and she took the unprecedented measure of teaching him, a man, the ways of the Coda, the warrior order she had once belonged to. Her Coda-teachings stabilized Cole&#x27;s sanity and removed what remained of his psionic powers. Cole and Zealot fought their own private war against members of the Daemonite race, as well as the Coda, Cole first taking the codename Grifter.

===Wildcats and Grifter solo series===
Cole and Zealot&#x27;s relationship eventually came to an end, though they remained partners. Both eventually joined the Daemonite-hunting team the WildC.A.T.s. Cole still loved Zealot, though he was unwilling to rekindle their relationship, since he thought doing so would only bring him pain. To stop two Daemonite lords from acquiring a spaceship which could be used to destroy or conquer Earth, the WildC.A.T.s allied themselves with Hightower, a Daemonite who had killed Grifter&#x27;s friend Lonely. Grifter voiced his objections and, once WildC.A.T.s founder Jacob Marlowe threatened to kick Grifter out of the team, Cole chose instead to quit on the spot. During the scramble for control of the spaceship, Grifter killed Hightower, avenging Lonely. The ship&#x27;s self-destruct sequence was activated, however, and the other WildC.A.T.s were forced to enter it and try to defuse it. They succeeded, resulting in the ship entering warpspace, taking it and the WildC.A.T.s back to Khera, while Earth&#x27;s post-human population, including Grifter, believed the team dead.

While another iteration of the WildC.A.T.s was created shortly thereafter, which included Cole&#x27;s brother Max, operating under the codename Condition Red, Grifter opted to operate independently, eventually becoming a mercenary soldier once again. Cole, with help from special agent Brockmeyer and I.O. officer and friend Alicia Turner, managed to get Del Gracci on tape confessing to Cole&#x27;s father&#x27;s murder. Grifter eventually found out from Max that his father had faked his own death, and confronted Winston in New Orleans. Winston revealed that he had stolen money from the Mafia, and had faked his own death to escape retaliation from the mob. Win tried to manipulate Grifter into protecting him from a man he had partnered on a con with and had come to the conclusion that Win was exploiting him. Grifter realized that his father was did not love him, and was a psychopath who was trying to use him. Cole then unraveled Win&#x27;s latest con, and threatened to kill him if he ever came to Cole&#x27;s attention again. Ultimately, letting his father escape before the police arrived.

The WildC.A.T.s eventually returned from Khera, and Grifter rejoined the team. Cole still had feelings for Zealot, and was particularly hurt when Zealot and John Colt, who had previously been Spartan until Colt&#x27;s memories and personality implanted in him resurfaced, briefly rekindled their relationship. Cole and John Colt both insisted Zealot choose between them and, though she was initially unwilling to deal with the situation, she eventually decided she needed to choose to preserve the team&#x27;s cohesion, and initially chose Colt out of a sense of loyalty as a Kherubim, eventually parting ways with him. Grifter began trying to seize the reins of the WildC.A.T.s and eventually became their leader during a period of time in which the team gained new members, including Olympia Atreidae, and Max Cash rejoined. Max was eventually murdered by a Coda assassin, and Grifter considered killing her in revenge, though Olympia, who had developed feelings for Max, murdered the assassin before the situation could come to a head.

After going their separate ways for a period of time, the Wildcats were reformed, only to disband once again after Zealot&#x27;s apparent death during a mission. Grifter spent some time operating once more as a mercenary, before joining a new iteration of the Wildcats, formed to take down a mysterious figure with ties to the Kherubims and Daemonites called Kenyan. By this point, the John Colt identity had receded and Spartan&#x27;s original personality had returned, and, as members of the new Wildcats team, Spartan and Grifter maintained a good working relationship, though Grifter seemed to hold some antipathy towards him. Around this time, Cole attended Team 7 member Alex Fairchild&#x27;s funeral with other still living members of the team, Lynch and Jackson Dane, as well as the members of Gen13, which includes Fairchild&#x27;s daughters Caitlin Fairchild and Roxanne Spaulding.

Grifter teamed-up with Backlash to help a group of animal-human hybrids called the Kindred. Tensions between the two remained high over what had occurred in Leningrad. Cole eventually came to the conclusion that Marc had changed, and opted to forgive him, and the two parted as friends.

Cole went on to have an encounter with Zealot, discovering she was alive, and managed to attain some closure. Spartan, now calling himself Jack Marlowe, came to an understanding with Cole, the two realizing they were like family, and would continue to work together in the future.

===Point Blank, Wildcats 3.0 and Sleeper===
After Team 7 field leader John Lynch was shot in the head, leaving him in a coma, Cole investigated the attack on Lynch, eventually coming to the conclusion that former WildC.A.T.S. member turned traitor Tao was involved in it. Cole discovered that Tao had created an organization made up of post-human criminals, and that Lynch had placed an undercover I.O. agent, Holden Carver in the organization, and vowed to help him leave the organization and clear his name. Tao eventually revealed that he had manipulated and brainwashed Cole into shooting Lynch, and then promptly forgetting about it. Tao then proceeded to erase this knowledge from Cole&#x27;s mind once again, leaving him unaware of his role in Lynch&#x27;s attack and Carver&#x27;s status as an undercover agent.

During a mission for Jack Marlowe, Cole&#x27;s legs were shattered by an FBI agent. Therefore, he could no longer operate as Marlowe&#x27;s field agent. He trained accountant Edwin Dolby (Grifter) to take his place. Dolby turned out to be unsuitable for the violent life that Grifter planned for him and resigned from Halo. After Marlowe apologized to him, he rejoined, but strictly as an accountant. Grifter remodeled the robotic body of former teammate Ladytron as a remote-controlled body for himself.

Several months later, Grifter&#x27;s legs were healed, a side effect of the dormant Gen-factor according to I.O. scientists. John Lynch, who had woken from his coma, restored Cole&#x27;s memory. Cole was sent to take down Tao and working together with double-agent Holden Carver, Tao&#x27;s organization was completely dismantled and Tao was imprisoned.

He later joined a makeshift team of former Wildcats to confront the assassin Nemesis.

World&#x27;s End

The Wildcats reformed after a near-extinction event nearly destroyed planet Earth. Grifter eventually left the team to join The Authority, and went on to enter into a romantic relationship with Flint.

== Other versions ==
===The Wild Storm===
Once a decorated soldier recruited by I.O. as yet another PMC in their ranks, Cole Cash had previously entered John Lynch&#x27;s Thunderbook Program where he received Gen&#x27; Active implants that changed him into a post-human.

He later faked his own death after making contact with Lord Emp, masking his desertion as a disastrous mission gone awry. In the years that followed he came under the tutelage of Emp&#x27;s fellow alien refugee, Zannah/Lucy Blaze and learned new combat techniques. After the incident where Angie Spica saved his life, Jacob Marlowe, CEO of HALO Industries, commissioned Cole&#x27;s services to find her before I.O. did.

Grifter, Kenesha/Savant and Adrianna/Void (operating as a rogue Wild C.A.T. cell) planned how to best bring Spica in, having surmised she was currently hiding at an old I.O. station at Camp Hero, Montauk.

The three C.A.T.s used Void&#x27;s transport method to warp themselves instantly to the safe-house. Adrianna tries to calm the visibly alarmed fugitive, while Cole urges her to come with them to a truly safe haven. But they all come under fire due to interception by an I.O Black Razor C.A.T (Covert Action Team) tasked with retrieving their wayward tech and Spica&#x27;s murder. In the ensuing battle, Grifter employs steady gunplay while Spica charges up her cybernetic suit and makes a hasty retreat.

Cole manages to dispatch the Razor team but finds Ms. Tereshkova downed by a piece of glass shrapnel sticking out of her temple. Scant seconds later a C.A.T troops he&#x27;d shot prepared to use his last grenade. Kenehsa removed the shrapnel piece from Void&#x27;s noggin just in time for her to warp them out.

Nonplussed that the mission was a failure, Kenesha and Cole bicker back and forth. Void decides to head out and find their missing charge on her own, without backup from a paramilitary group this time.

Upon their return, Cole and Kenesha express their gratitude to Void. Angie is still worried about I.O. finding her especially considering they&#x27;re stationed so close to their headquarters (Cole is hiding out in Brooklyn). Back at home base, Cash wondered why Adrianna enjoyed reading a daily newspaper over digital news, when they received a call from John Colt. Colt was undercover within the Hightower locale belonging to I.O&#x27;s invention &amp; engineering division, but he had been compromised. He needed a quick exfiltration before I.O. security apprehended him, as his computer snooping had triggered shield protocols that blocked Void&#x27;s transmatter teleportation and an impending general alarm. Cole was able to guide him to an open spot where he could jump privately before enemy agents tagged him. John revealed his intel concerned Machine Telepathy, a program in which phone apps, mobile programs or wireless appliances could read the minds of their users and transmit them to IO&#x27;s servers.

Angela wakes from a nap, and scans all of her new friends with her stolen tech, seeing that Mr. Colt and Kenesha are as alien as Jacob under their human skins. The C.A.T&#x27;s speculate about the possibility that I.O. has discovered that the owner &amp; founder of HALO is Kheran. But John quickly rebuffs this, for any attempt to expose or target Marlowe would bring up questions for everyone.

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the 2011 &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline, Grifter is the leader of the United Kingdom&#x27;s resistance movement against the Amazons. In a flashback, Grifter assembles Team 7 to battle against terrorists in the Middle East, until they were killed. Grifter was saved by Penny Black (Britannia) and escapes from the Middle East. While Grifter was recovering, the United Kingdom is invaded by the Amazons. Grifter assembles the Resistance to fight against the Amazons. In the present, Lois Lane is rescued by the Resistance from a camp just before she is converted into an Amazon. It is revealed that the Resistance were helping to find Penny&#x27;s armor prototype at Westminster, as it could turn the war around. While the Resistance are headed towards Westminster, Resistance member Miss Hyde betrays them and contacts the Female Furies. She then tries to make the Resistance surrender by holding a knife to the throat of Lois. However, Miss Hyde regains control of the body and fights the Amazons, allowing the Resistance to gain the upper hand. After they escape the Westminster Palace, Grifter gathers with Britannia, who has then recovered her armor and found a group of released prisoners. The two then lead the Resistance in an all-out battle against the Amazons. Grifter and the Resistance arrive to attack in the Atlantean/Amazon war, and Grifter heralds their arrival by helping Batman take down Black Manta. Grifter is killed in battle by Enchantress who is then killed by Superman.

===The New 52 ===
With The New 52, the 2011 relaunch of all of DC Comics&#x27; series that immediately followed &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, Grifter is established to be a former U.S. Army Special Ops soldier who deserted and became a con-artist. During one of his latest cons, Cole Cash is assaulted and abducted by Daemonites, aliens who can &quot;possess&quot; human bodies. Cash is held for 17 days, while a Daemonite attempts to take possession of his body. For unknown reasons Cole wakens prematurely, aborting the transfer and leaving him with the ability to overhear the telepathic communication of Daemonites. He subsequently hijacks a plane and kills several Daemonites disguised as humans resulting in him being wanted for crimes and terrorism. Cash is now wanted by several intelligence agencies and his brother Max, also a military special operative, is tasked with apprehending him. Furthermore, the Daemonites also wish to retrieve Cash to maintain their secrecy. On the run from his many pursuers, Cash dons a costume from a costume shop to conceal his identity.

At some point in outer space, Grifter encounters Superman, who is in a battle against Helspont and the Daemonites. However, the interaction between the two is brief, for Grifter&#x27;s ship hull is breached by Biomass. Superman knocks Biomass out into space, sealing the breach behind them with his heat vision.

Near the end of the New 52, Grifter is recruited by King Faraday to work with Deathstroke on Cadmus Island, where thousands of Earth 2 refugees are being inhumanely held captive, after experiencing their home planet being destroyed by Apokolips.

In the alternate timeline of the Future State crossover, Grifter teams up with Luke Fox, and encounters a hostile Helena Bertinelli, while trying to escape from Magistrate and the Black Mask Syndicate, to make it out of Gotham City. Being offered a payment of $75,000 in exchange for her help, Helena agrees to assist Grifter and Luke in leaving the city. Matters become more complicated, given that both Grifter and The Huntress are willing to use lethal force, while Luke lives by a moral code.

===Infinite Frontier===

Sometime following the &quot;Joker War,&quot; Grifter begins to work as a bodyguard in Gotham City, being hired by Lucius Fox. Upon meeting Batman, the two fight until Lucius intervenes. After having a conversation with Lucius about The Joker, Punchline, and the Wayne family fortune, Batman warns Grifter that he knows who Grifter&#x27;s real boss is, and that Gotham will always be under his watch.

In addition to being a bodyguard for Lucius, Grifter also begins his personal pursuit of Batman, looking to end the vigilante activities of the Caped Crusader. After conspiring with Deathstroke in a failed trap attempt to catch Batman, Grifter instead finds himself being chased by a misunderstood Superman, but manages to teleport away with the help of Void. It is shortly revealed that Zealot is helping Grifter with his bodyguard duties.

==Powers and abilities==
===Wildstorm===
As a result of exposure to the Gen-factor, Deadeye possesses strong powers of telekinesis and telepathy. These abilities came at a cost however as extraneous use of his Gen-Active attributes led to a debilitating effect on his mind and body dubbed The Rush; which were terrible side effects akin to a power-trip addiction threatening to wreak havoc on his and the rest of Team 7&#x27;s psyches driving the users to madness when utilized unabated, chief among the flaws were loss of psionic&#x27;s control which causes him to lash out in raw psychic force while reining them in at that time would cause blood vessels to rupture weakening him further still. The power began to burn out over the years and by the time of the Dead Reckoning mission, his telepathic assault was only enough to give an enemy agent a bloody nose.

Zealot taught Cole not only how to remove his powers, but also how bring them back, though he can also use them under other circumstances (usually the presence of another Team 7 member so that they can combine their powers). This training also makes it nearly impossible for individuals with psychic powers to enter Cole&#x27;s mind. Additionally, John Lynch placed particularly strong psychic shields within Grifter&#x27;s mind, making him immune to Tao and Peter Grimm&#x27;s powers.

A side effect of his Gen-factor exposure seems to be accelerated regeneration. This healing factor also appears to have slowed his aging. He was the youngest member of Team 7, and though over 20 years have passed since his exposure to the substance, he still has the appearance and vitality of a man in his mid-to-late 20s. But its nature is fickle at best and rarely ever very effective, one moment healing a broken neck in seconds, to taking months for shattered legs to mend properly, albeit without any scarring. After the Worldstorm event his relatively dormant abilities have reasserted themselves in a far greater capacity, Mr. Cash being capable of more impressive psionic effects than when his powers first waxed &amp; waned.

He&#x27;s also an adept psionic intuit, able to perceive things well beyond the need of sensory input. Apart from these superhuman powers, Cole is a talented marksman and expert hand-to-hand combatant.

Skilled in both firearms and thrown weapon usage on top of his already impressive unarmed melee abilities, Grifter has been known to single-handedly take down large groups of armed opponents. Having been taught the Coda killing arts by Zealot, being the only man to have been fully trained in them. The extra conventional martial arts training from Marc Slayton and former Team 6 member Jung has made Cash a force to be reckoned with.

While Cole&#x27;s specialty is firearms he is also highly skilled with knives; having killed a Daemonite armed only with a combat knife in the past, as well as managing to stab Paris, one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the world. Cole is also an accomplished swordsman, having been trained by Zealot. He is also a very capable demolitionist often employing shaped charges like hand grenades or thermite whilst in pitched combat with large numbers of, or more skilled enemies. Grifter is also adept at black book operations with skills pertaining to the spy network ranging from; disguise mastery, infiltration, stealth, deception, tactics, survival, vehicular operation, sabotage and the like.

===The Wild Storm===
Grifter is ex-military, recruited out of the U.S. special forces by International Operations for teamwork initially, eventually upgrading to solo ops work.

Grifter was tutored in combat by Lucy Blaze A.K.A. Zannah of Khera, Cole at one point participated in the Thunderbook initiative. A program in which I.O. operatives were implanted with kherubim genetic material, which caused them to generate new auxiliary organs or modify natural biophysical structure to produce newfound superhuman facilities. It also has the side effect of instilling a secondary consciousness within their minds that influence their actions and abilities from within. As a combat specialist, Cole is an adept gun fighter with uncanny aim and body coordination. He has however been warned by Zannah that though she taught him all he knows, that&#x27;s not all she knows.

Grifter is able to juggle concussion grenades back at their source with a few well placed pistol shots. Mr. Cash is quite skilled at combining acrobatics with his gunkata, able to make backflips, jumps and side leaps while firing off his pistols with pinpoint accuracy. Cole Cash is also an adept tactician and navigator, able to scope out a &quot;gag&quot;/operation based upon accumulated information on how best to proceed.

===New 52===
As part of DC Comics&#x27; 2011 reboot of its continuity, The New 52, Grifter is established to have been a trained soldier and ace marksmen long before he received his augmentations by the Daemonites. On top of his military training he was an experienced con artist who is quite skilled in theft, infiltration and misdirection in his own right. Shooting wise he&#x27;s skilled enough to time his shots to block the firing chamber of an adversaries gun quite handily. After being experimented on by his Daemonite captors to be host of the collective leader, Cash had been biogenically altered to unknown degrees; he became able to hear the thought process as well as detect the presence of hosting Daemonites within his immediate vicinity. Even being able to see them as who and what they truly are as opposed to what they&#x27;re pretending to be, he has even shown telepathic prowess beyond just sensing and seeing hosting alien beings able to read the thoughts of others besides just the minds of Daemonites.

He&#x27;s fast enough and dexterous enough to snatch a speeding arrow out of the air and later is revealed to be telekinetic as well, using his powers to bring down an avalanche on his enemy as well as levitate and operate a host of heavy ordinance with his mind, turning his psychic powers inward he can enhance his physical abilities when/if need be. Able to deck the larger and stronger Daemonites with a mere-backhand, knock down and engage Midnighter in a fist fight whom he could barely even tickle before and much more. About 40 years in the future Cole seems to remain a man in his physical prime, meaning whatever experimentation done on him by his captors evidently extended his lifespan by decades at a time. In that expanse he&#x27;s also gained a form of reality vision, his telepathy had expanded to the point where he could not only see and hear the thoughts of Daemonites or other possessing entities but could also detect beings from other realities as well.

==Reception==
Sales for The New 52 version of &quot;Grifter&quot; struggled. Despite a strong launch that found the series debut selling 37,100 issues, sales quickly plummeted, selling 14,903 in March 2012. Issue #8, which was Edmondson&#x27;s last as writer, sold 14,117 issues.

Critical reception for the series was mixed. The A.V. Club&#x27;s Keith Phipps and Oliver Sava disagreed on the debut issue, with Phipps saying: &quot;It reads like a book that could turn into something, but as a jumping-on point, this didn&#x27;t really work for me,&quot; while Sava called it &quot;a solid action thriller with a sci-fi twist.&quot; MTV Geek largely panned the opening issue, giving it a score of 10/52 and saying &quot;Grifter feels like a series of sort of clever action beats that never got put together as a proper story&quot;.

<text>The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) is a United States law, codified at Title 28, §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1441(d), and 1602–1611 of the United States Code, that established criteria as to whether a foreign sovereign state (or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities) is immune from the jurisdiction of the United States&#x27; federal or state courts. The Act also establishes specific procedures for service of process, attachment of property and execution of judgment in proceedings against a foreign state. The FSIA provides the exclusive basis and means to bring a civil suit against a foreign sovereign in the United States. It was signed into law by United States President Gerald Ford on October 21, 1976.

==History==
Foreign state immunity has a long history in U.S. courts. In an early case, &quot;The Schooner Exchange v. M&#x27;Faddon&quot;, 11 U.S. 116 (1812), the Supreme Court held that a private party could not sue the government of France. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that a plaintiff cannot sue a foreign sovereign claiming ownership to a warship which had taken refuge in Philadelphia. Following international practice and common law principles, U.S. courts routinely refused to hear claims against foreign governments, even where those claims related to commercial activities. The U.S. State Department followed the absolute theory of immunity for foreign states, and courts generally relied on suggestions of immunity by the State Department in actions against foreign sovereigns. In 1952, the U.S. State Department, noting changes in international practice, adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity according to which the public acts (&quot;jure imperii&quot;) of a foreign state are entitled to immunity, while the private acts (&quot;jure gestionis&quot;) are not.

The United States was the first country to codify the law of foreign sovereign immunity by statute. The FSIA had three broad objectives: (1) to transfer responsibility for immunity determinations from the Department of State to the judiciary; (2) to define and codify the &quot;restrictive&quot; theory of immunity; and (3) to provide a comprehensive, uniform regime for litigation against foreign states and governmental agencies.

Though the Act places the determination of sovereign immunity fully in the hands of the judiciary, many courts have expressed reluctance to find that a defendant is a sovereign if the &quot;state&quot; in question is one that the U.S. government has not officially recognized, even if the defendant may arguably satisfy the definition of statehood under international law.

The enactment of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act in 2016 has allowed U.S. citizens to sue foreign powers over terrorist acts committed on U.S. soil.

==Jurisdictional statute==
The FSIA is a jurisdictional statute. It indicates what conditions must be met in order for a lawsuit against a foreign state to be instituted, not what conduct by a foreign sovereign is actionable. If a foreign defendant qualifies as a &quot;foreign state&quot; under the FSIA, the Act provides that it shall be immune to suit in any U.S. court—federal or state—unless a statutory exception to immunity applies. The applicability of an exception to immunity is a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction, meaning if there is no exception to immunity, a court cannot hear the claim and must dismiss the suit. In &quot;Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria&quot;, the defendant challenged the jurisdiction of the district court, saying that FSIA could not give jurisdiction to the district court since it was not a case &quot;arising under&quot; federal law. The Supreme Court found that since any invocation of jurisdiction under the FSIA would necessarily involve analysis of the exceptions to FSIA, FSIA cases by definition arise under federal law.

Under the FSIA, the burden of proof is initially on the defendant to establish that it is a &quot;foreign state&quot; under the FSIA and therefore entitled to state immunity. &quot;Foreign state&quot; is defined at 28 U.S.C. § 1603(a),(b). Once the defendant establishes that it is a foreign state, for the lawsuit to proceed, the plaintiff must prove that one of the Act&#x27;s exceptions to immunity apply. The exceptions define both the types of actions as to which immunity does not attach and the territorial nexus required for adjudication in U.S. courts. The Act creates a form of long-arm statute establishing jurisdiction over claims that meet the criteria. 
The exceptions are listed at 28 U.S.C. §§ 1605, 1605A, and 1607. The most common exceptions are when the foreign state waives immunity (§ 1605(a)(1)) or agrees to submit a dispute to arbitration (§ 1605(a)(6)), engages in a commercial activity (§ 1605(a)(2)), commits a tort in the United States causing &quot;personal injury or death, or damage to or loss of property&quot; (such as a common traffic collision) (§ 1605(a)(5)), or expropriates property in violation of international law (§ 1605(a)(3)). The FSIA also excludes immunity in cases involving certain counterclaims (§ 1607) and admiralty claims (§ 1605(b)). Section 221 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 added an exception for U.S. victims of terrorism, for any government designated by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. The Flatow Amendment was also added in 1996, named after lawyer Stephen Flatow who fought to sue Iran over the suicide bombing that killed his daughter Alisa in 1995, which made those responsible for such attacks liable in court.

In response to the decision of &quot;Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran&quot; that made it difficult to seek private cause of action lawsuits against foreign states even with the Flatow Amendment, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 greatly expanded the terrorism exceptions by moving these as a whole to § 1605A, making foreign states liable for the actions of their officers in cause of action lawsuits, and expanding exceptions for torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, and hostage-taking.

In 2016, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act removed the requirement that a state sponsor of terrorism be officially listed, so that victim families of the September 11 attacks could sue Saudi Arabia.

==Scope and applicability==
===Retroactive application===
In 2004, the Supreme Court held in &quot;Republic of Austria v. Altmann&quot;, 541 U.S. 677 (2004) that the FSIA applies retroactively. That case involved a claim by the descendants of owners of famous paintings against the Austrian government for return of those paintings, which were allegedly seized during the Nazi era. As a consequence of &quot;Altmann&quot;, for lawsuits filed after the enactment of the FSIA (1976), FSIA standards of immunity and its exceptions apply, even where the conduct that took place prior to enactment of the FSIA.

===Exclusive basis for suit===
In &quot;Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.&quot;, 488 U.S. 428 (1989), the Supreme Court held that the FSIA provides the &quot;sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state&quot;. In that case, a Liberian-owned oil tanker which was traveling outside of the &quot;war zones&quot; designated by the United Kingdom and Argentina during the Falklands War in 1982 was struck by an air to surface rocket fired by an Argentine jet. The shipping company sued Argentina in federal court claiming that Argentina&#x27;s actions violated the Alien Tort Statute 28 U.S.C. § 1350 and general admiralty law. Because the Court found that the FSIA provided the exclusive means of suing the foreign sovereign, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were not permitted to bring suit under the Alien Tort Statute or general admiralty law.

==Definition of &quot;foreign state&quot;==

The FSIA only applies to lawsuits involving a foreign state. The FSIA defines (28 U.S.C. § 1603(a)) &quot;foreign state&quot; to include three entities:
* A foreign state
* A political subdivision of a foreign state
* An agency or instrumentality of a foreign state

&quot;Agency or instrumentality&quot; is then defined (28 U.S.C. § 1603(b)) as any entity which has a separate legal identity and is either:
* an &quot;organ of a foreign state or political subdivision&quot;, or
* has a &quot;majority of ... shares or other ownership interest&quot; owned by a foreign state or political subdivision.

In &quot;Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson&quot;, 538 U.S. 468 (2003), the Supreme Court determined that in order for a government owned corporation to qualify as a foreign state under the FSIA because a majority of its &quot;shares or other ownership interest&quot; are owned by a foreign state or political subdivision, the foreign state must directly own a majority of the corporation&#x27;s shares. In &quot;Dole&quot;, two chemical corporations indirectly owned by the Israeli government sought to remove a case from a Hawaii state court to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii on the basis that the FSIA applied. The Supreme Court concluded that because the Israeli government did not directly own a majority of the companies shares, the corporations could not be considered foreign states and the FSIA therefore did not apply. The court specifically rejected the companies&#x27; argument that Israel&#x27;s majority interest in the companies through indirect ownership qualified as an &quot;other ownership interest&quot; under the FSIA or that Israel&#x27;s actual control over the corporations would qualify. In reaching its conclusion, the court also held that the determination as to whether a defendant qualifies as a foreign state is made at the time the plaintiff files the complaint.

There had been disagreement among the courts as to whether an individual government official is covered by the FSIA, and therefore immune to suit according to its provisions or whether traditional (pre-FSIA) common law rules of immunity apply. The majority of Federal Courts of Appeals had concluded that individuals are covered under § 1603(b) as &quot;agencies or instrumentalities&quot; of foreign states. See &quot;In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001&quot;, 538 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding Saudi government officials to be entitled to immunity under the FSIA). Other courts however, noting that the language and structure of the FSIA and particularly § 1603(b) appear to contemplate that entities and not individuals are covered by the &quot;agency or instrumentality&quot; definition, had concluded that individuals are not entitled to immunity under the FSIA. See &quot;Yousuf v. Samantar&quot;, 552 F.3d 371 (4th Cir. 2009) (holding that former Somalian government official is not covered by, and therefore entitled to immunity under the FSIA and remanding to District Court to determine whether defendant is entitled to common law immunity).

However, the Supreme Court in 2010 decided that the Act does not extend immunity to a government official acting on behalf of a state. In the case of &quot;Samantar v. Yousuf&quot; decided in June 2010, the Supreme Court found that there is nothing to suggest that &quot;foreign state&quot; within the FSIA should be read to include an official acting on behalf of that state. Justice Stevens, with the unanimous support of the Supreme Court, made the decision into common law with his many paragraphs on the court case. This helped define what is considered to be a foreign state, which now included state officials acting within their jurisdiction.

Moreover, the potential of the FSIA to undermine foreign policy goals of the executive branch has been an ongoing concern.

== Commercial activity exception ==
The most important exception to sovereign immunity is the commercial activity exception, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2). This section provides three bases on which a plaintiff can sue a foreign state:

* When the plaintiff&#x27;s claim is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state.
* When the plaintiff&#x27;s claim is based upon an act by the foreign state which is performed in the United States in connection with commercial activity outside the United States.
* When the plaintiff&#x27;s claim is based upon an act by the foreign state which is performed outside the United States in connection with commercial activity outside the United States and which causes a direct effect in the United States.

In determining whether a foreign state&#x27;s activities are commercial, the FSIA requires that courts look to the nature of the act itself, rather than the purpose for which the foreign sovereign engaged in the act (28 U.S.C. § 1603(d)). For example, the operation of a fee-based transportation system would likely be a commercial act, while imposing fines for parking tickets would be a public act, even if the former was undertaken to provide a public service, and the latter was initiated to raise revenue.

&quot;Republic of Argentina v. Weltover&quot;, 504 U.S. 607 (1992), concerned a breach of contract claim asserted by the bond-holder (two Panamanian corporations and a Swiss bank) against the government (Argentina) that issued the bonds arising from Argentina&#x27;s default on the bond payments. Under the terms of the bonds, the bond-holders were given the option of having the bonds paid in London, Frankfurt, Zürich, or New York. Because the case concerned a default in Argentina on bonds issued in Argentina (i.e., an act performed outside the United States in connection with activity outside the United States), in order to establish jurisdiction, the plaintiff&#x27;s could only rely on the third basis to sue Argentina under the commercial activity exception. Argentina made two primary arguments as to why the FSIA commercial activity exception should not apply: (1) the issuance of sovereign debt to investors was not a &quot;commercial&quot; activity and (2) the alleged default could not be considered to have had a &quot;direct effect&quot; in the United States. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court held that Argentina was not entitled to sovereign immunity. Reasoning that &quot;when a foreign government acts, not as regulator of a market, but in the manner of a private player within it, the foreign sovereign&#x27;s actions are &#x27;commercial, the Court concluded that Argentina&#x27;s issuance of the bonds was of a commercial character. As for the &quot;direct effect&quot; in the United States, the Court rejected the suggestion that under the FSIA the effect in the United States necessarily needed to be &quot;substantial&quot; or &quot;foreseeable&quot;, and instead concluded that in order to be &quot;direct&quot;, the effect need only follow &quot;as an immediate consequence of the defendant&#x27;s activity&quot;. Because New York was the place where payment was supposed to be made, and payment &quot;was not forthcoming&quot;, the Court concluded that the effect was direct, notwithstanding the fact that none of the plaintiffs were situated in New York. Weltover&#x27;s oral argument that won the unanimous decision was made by New York-based attorney Richard Cutler, while Argentina&#x27;s losing position was argued by New York-based attorney Richard Davis.

The District Court for the District of Columbia held in &quot;Upton v Empire of Iran&quot; (1978) that &quot;direct effect&quot; is to be given its common sense interpretation: a direct effect &quot;has no intervening element, but, rather, flows in a straight line without deviation or interruption&quot;.

The involvement of a US citizen or a body incorporated in the United States is not in itself sufficient to establish a &quot;direct effect&quot; in the United States if a case involves no other form of direct connection.

In 2015, the Supreme Court unanimously held in &quot;OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs&quot; that the purchase of a rail ticket from an authorized agent in the US does not fall within the commercial activity exception when the lawsuit concerns a rail accident in a foreign country. Carol Sachs, a US resident, purchased a Eurail pass on the internet from a US-based travel agent. She used the pass to board a train operated by the Austrian national railway, ÖBB Personenverkehr AG (ÖBB), but during the process she fell onto the tracks and her legs were crushed by the moving train, requiring the amputation of both of her legs. Sachs sued ÖBB in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for damages related to the incident. She reasoned that the suit was not barred by the FSIA because it was &quot;based upon&quot; the sale of the ticket by the US-based travel agent. The court ruled that the suit did not fall within the commercial activities exception. It was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the judgment, holding that the purchase of the ticket from a US-based travel agent established agency. The Supreme Court looked at the &quot;particular conduct on which the [lawsuit] is based&quot; and held that, because that conduct occurred in Austria, the case did not fall within the commercial activities exception.

=== Genocidal takings ===

One student&#x27;s note has argued that matters of genocidal takings are regarded as exceeding the jurisdictional limits of the FSIA&#x27;s international takings exception. In June 2017, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the FSIA did not prevent the survivors of a Holocaust victim from suing to recover art stolen by Nazi plunderers. However, the ruling was challenged by Germany to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in a unanimous decision in February 2021 that FSIA does not permit legal action to be taken against foreign states for property taken from individuals by foreign states, as the provisions of FSIA are directed towards state property taken by other states, and vacated the lower court rulings. The case, &quot;Germany v. Philipp&quot;, dealt with the applicability of the FSIA for heirs of victims of the Holocaust to sue Germany in the United States court systems for compensation for items that were taken by the Nazi Party during World War II. The court unanimously ruled that FSIA does not allow these survivors to sue Germany in U.S. court, reasoning that the sale was an act of expropriation of property rather than an act of genocide, although granting that other means of recovery are still potentially available. The decision also concluded a related case, &quot;Hungary v. Simon&quot;, which was decided &quot;per curiam&quot; on the ruling of &quot;Germany&quot;.

=== Industrial espionage by state-owned enterprises ===
FSIA has been invoked by state-owned enterprises as well as their subsidiaries and joint ventures, particularly those owned by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, accused of industrial espionage and intellectual property theft, as a defense from legal action.

=== COVID-19 ===

In &quot;The State of Missouri v. The People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, Missouri sued China in April 2020 for economic damages caused by COVID-19. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri dismissed the case in July 2022, ruling that China had sovereign immunity. Missouri appealed. In January 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the FSIA barred all of Missouri&#x27;s claims except one—alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment—under the commercial activity exception. The Eighth Circuit Court reversed the dismissal of the hoarding claim and remanded the case for further proceedings.

==Notable legal cases==
&quot;Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran&quot; in 2004 was heard after the additions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Flatow Amendment to FSIA, which were related to punitive damages from emotional distress from family members of a surviving Lebanon hostage crisis from Iran. While an earlier case by the hostage was successful in winning compensatory damages in his original suit, the DC Circuit Court ruled that the amended FSIA did not allow for a private cause of action against a foreign state, only against individuals. This decision filtered through the other circuit courts, which prompted Congress to significantly modify the exemptions related to terrorism in the 2008 NDAA to specifically allow for foreign states to be sued on a private cause of action, retroactively applying this to the other legal cases pending at the time.

In 2008, Saudi Arabia invoked the FSIA to preclude a lawsuit filed by families and victims of the September 11 attacks who alleged that the Saudi leaders had indirectly financed al-Qaeda. Congress responded in 2016 by overriding President Obama&#x27;s veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), amending FSIA and allowing the families&#x27; suit against Saudi Arabia to proceed in U.S. courts.

In &quot;John V. Doe v. Holy See&quot;, 557 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir. 2009), the Holy See invoked the FSIA in a lawsuit related to child abuse incidents in various U.S. churches. The ruling ultimately did not rely on state immunity.

In &quot;Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd.&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled on June 16, 2014, against Argentina&#x27;s appeal of a lower court ruling that Argentina&#x27;s government must uphold its contractual obligation to pay in full those bondholders who refused to accept reduced payments negotiated in foreign debt restructurings carried out by Argentina in 2005 and 2010 after that state&#x27;s government defaulted on its debt in 2001. Later the same day, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7–1 ruling (Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor recused herself from both cases without giving a reason for doing so), gave permission for those bondholders to seek information on Argentina&#x27;s assets in the United States and abroad by issuing subpoenas to banks to trace those assets.

In &quot;Republic of Sudan v. Harrison&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled in March 2019 that the FSIA requires that civil process (court summons and civil complaints) be addressed and delivered directly to the foreign minister of a foreign state, and that delivery to an embassy in the US is not sufficient.

In &quot;Opati v. Republic of Sudan&quot;, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in May 2020 that FSIA allowed for punitive damages on a cause of action from conduct before the enactment of the FSIA, in a case related to the 1998 United States embassy bombings.

In &quot;Germany v. Philipp&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the FSIA does not allow for survivors or heirs of victims of the Holocaust and Nazi Germany to sue Germany for compensation for possessions taken or forced into sale by the Nazi Party.

==Proposed amendments==

On March 25, 2014, U.S. Representative Steve Chabot introduced the Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act (H.R. 4292; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives. According to a legislative digest provided by House Republicans, the bill &quot;narrowly amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to make it easier for U.S. cultural and educational institutions to borrow art and other culturally significant objects from foreign countries&quot;. However, the changes made by the bill would not provide any immunity to art or objects that were &quot;taken in violation of international law by Nazi Germany between January 30, 1933 and May 8, 1945&quot;. The Congressional Budget Office reported that &quot;under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President&#x27;s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest. However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts. H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure&quot;. The bill was scheduled to be voted on under suspension of the rules on May 6, 2014. In May 2016 the Senate passed a bill called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act which also was passed by the house shortly after. Obama vetoed the bill in September 2016, but the Senate overrode the veto in a 97–1 vote. With the bill becoming a law it added an amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow the families of 9/11 to sue the sponsors of &quot;terrorist attacks on U.S. soil&quot;, as chairman Goodlatte said on the override vote.

<text>The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed for nearly a millennium, from 1000 to 1946. The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom around the year 1000; his family (the Árpád dynasty) led the monarchy for 300 years. By the 12th century, the kingdom became a European power.

Due to the Ottoman occupation of the central and southern territories of Hungary in the 16th century, the country was partitioned into three parts: the Habsburg Royal Hungary, Ottoman Hungary, and the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania. The House of Habsburg held the Hungarian throne after the Battle of Mohács in 1526 continuously until 1918 and also played a key role in the liberation wars against the Ottoman Empire.

From 1867, territories connected to the Hungarian crown were incorporated into Austria-Hungary under the name of Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen. The monarchy ended with the deposition of the last king Charles IV in 1918, after which Hungary became a republic. The kingdom was nominally restored during the &quot;Regency&quot; of 1920–46, ending under the Soviet occupation in 1946.

The Kingdom of Hungary was a multiethnic state from its inception until the Treaty of Trianon and it covered what is today Hungary, Slovakia, Transylvania and other parts of Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia (now part of Ukraine), Vojvodina (now part of Serbia), the territory of Burgenland (now part of Austria), Međimurje (now part of Croatia), Prekmurje (now part of Slovenia) and a few villages which are now part of Poland. From 1102, it also included the Kingdom of Croatia, being in personal union with it, united under the King of Hungary.

According to the demographers, about 80 percent of the population was made up of Hungarians before the Battle of Mohács, however in the mid-19th century out of a population of 14 million less than 6 million were Hungarian due to the resettlement policies and continuous immigration from neighboring countries. Major territorial changes made Hungary ethnically homogeneous after World War I. More than nine-tenths of the population of modern Hungary is ethnically Hungarian and speaks Hungarian as their mother tongue.

Today, the feast day of the first king Stephen I (20 August) is a national holiday in Hungary, commemorating the foundation of the state (Foundation Day).

==Names==

The Latin forms or ( meaning kingdom); (Kingdom of Mary); or simply , were the names used in official documents in Latin from the beginning of the kingdom to the 1840s.

The German name () was used officially from 1784 to 1790; it was used again between 1849 and the 1860s.

The Hungarian name () was used in the 1840s, and then again from the 1860s to 1946. The unofficial Hungarian name of the kingdom was , which is still the colloquial, and also the official name of Hungary.

The names in the other native languages of the kingdom were: , , , , , , and Italian (for the city of Fiume), .

In Austria-Hungary (1867–1918), the unofficial name was sometimes used to denote the regions of the Kingdom of Hungary. Officially, the term Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen was included for the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary, although this term was also in use prior to that time.

==History==

===Origins===

The Hungarians, led by Árpád (who might have been either their sacred ruler or &quot;kende&quot;) or their military leader or &quot;gyula&quot;, settled the Carpathian Basin in 895 and established the Principality of Hungary (896–1000). The Hungarians led several successful incursions to Western Europe, until they were stopped by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor in Battle of Lechfeld.

===Middle Ages===
====High Middle Ages====

The principality was succeeded by the Christian Kingdom of Hungary with the coronation of St Stephen I (son of principal Géza. Originally called Vajk until baptized) at Esztergom on Christmas Day 1000. The first kings of the kingdom were from the Árpád dynasty. He fought against Koppány and in 998, with Bavarian help, defeated him near Veszprém. The Catholic Church received powerful support from Stephen I, who with Christian Hungarians and German knights wanted a Christian kingdom established in Central Europe. Stephen I of Hungary was canonized as a Catholic saint in 1083 and an Eastern Orthodox saint in 2000.
Around the 11th century, the Kingdom of Hungary became a Christian state, and Catholicism in the Hungarian Kingdom was a state religion.

After his death, a period of revolts and conflict for supremacy ensued between the royalty and the nobles. In 1051, armies of the Holy Roman Empire tried to conquer Hungary, but they were defeated at Vértes Mountain. The armies of the Holy Roman Empire continued to suffer defeats; the second greatest battle was at the town now called Bratislava, in 1052. Before 1052, Peter Orseolo, a supporter of the Holy Roman Empire, was overthrown by king Samuel Aba of Hungary.
This period of revolts ended during the reign of Béla I. Hungarian chroniclers praised Béla I for introducing new currency, such as the silver denarius, and for his benevolence to the former followers of his nephew, Solomon. He was succeeded by Ladislaus I of Hungary, who further stabilized and strengthened the kingdom. He was also canonized as a saint. Under his rule Hungarians successfully fought against the Cumans and acquired parts of Croatia in 1091. Due to a dynastic crisis in Croatia, with the help of the local nobility who supported his claim, he managed to swiftly seize power in northern parts of the Croatian kingdom (Slavonia), as he was a claimant to the throne due to the fact that his sister was married to the late Croatian king Zvonimir who died without an heir.
However, kingship over all of Croatia would not be achieved until the reign of his successor Coloman. With the coronation of King Coloman as &quot;King of Croatia and Dalmatia&quot; in Biograd in 1102, the two kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary were united under one crown. Although the precise terms of this relationship became a matter of dispute in the 19th century, it is believed that Coloman created a kind of personal union between the two kingdoms. The nature of the relationship varied through time, Croatia retained a large degree of internal autonomy overall, while the real power rested in the hands of the local nobility. Modern Croatian and Hungarian historiographies mostly view the relations between Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526) and Kingdom of Hungary from 1102 as a form of a personal union, i.e. that they were connected by a common king. Also, one of the greatest Hungarian jurists and statesmen of the 16th century, István Werbőczy in his work &quot;Tripartitum&quot; treats Croatia as a kingdom separate to Hungary.

Especially Arabic and Byzantine travelers from this time praised the richness country, the dense pastures, the nicely cultivated lands, the plentiful animals in waters and forests. They said that the wheat is cheap, the markets are populous, the cities flourish and the folk are wealthy. Although it is hardly credible that they refer to all layers of society, the documents were inspired by the reality.

===== 13th century: Mongol invasion and recovery =====
In 1222, Andrew II issued the Golden Bull which laid down the principles of law.

In 1241, Hungary was invaded by the Mongols and while the first minor battles with Subutai&#x27;s vanguard probes ended in seeming Hungarian victories, the Mongols finally destroyed the combined Hungarian and Cuman armies at the Battle of Muhi. The Mongol invasions ultimately resulted in the death of 15-25% of Hungary&#x27;s population, some 300,000-500,000 people in total. In 1242, after the end of the Mongol invasion, numerous fortresses to defend against future invasion were erected by Béla IV of Hungary. In gratitude, the Hungarians acclaimed him as the &quot;Second Founder of the Homeland&quot;, and the Hungarian Kingdom again became a considerable force in Europe.

In 1260 Béla IV lost the War of Babenberg Succession, his army was defeated at the Battle of Kressenbrunn by the united Bohemian forces. However, in 1278, Ladislaus IV of Hungary and Austrian troops fully destroyed the Bohemian army at the Battle on the Marchfeld.
====Late Middle Ages====
The Árpád dynasty died out in 1301 with the death of Andrew III. Subsequently, Hungary was ruled by the Angevins until the end of the 14th century, and then by several non-dynastic rulers – notably Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and Matthias Corvinus – until the early 16th century.

=====The Anjou Age=====

When Andrew III&#x27;s predecessor, Ladislaus IV, was assassinated in 1290, another nobleman was set up as titular King of Hungary: Charles Martel of Anjou. Charles Martel was the son of King Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary, the sister of Ladislaus IV. However, Andrew III took the crown for himself and ruled without inconvenience after Charles Martel&#x27;s death in 1295. Upon Andrew&#x27;s death in 1301, the country was divided between powerful lords hostile to each other. A coalition of some of these oligarchs first crowned Wenceslaus III, who quickly fled from the anarchy, then Otto III, who was forced to leave by the Kán family. Charles, remaining as the only candidate, was finally crowned King Charles I in 1310. His famous battle at Rozgony, described as &quot;most cruel battle since the Mongol invasion of Europe&quot; by the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;, ended his war of reunification.

He implemented considerable economic reforms and defeated the remaining nobility who were in opposition to royal rule, led by Máté Csák III. The kingdom of Hungary reached an age of prosperity and stability under Charles I. The gold mines of the Kingdom were extensively worked and soon Hungary reached a prominent standing in European gold production. The forint was introduced as a currency, replacing the &quot;denars&quot;, and soon after Charles&#x27;s reforms were implemented, the economy of the Kingdom started to prosper again, having fallen into a parlous state following the Mongol invasion.

Charles exalted the cult to Saint Ladislaus I, using him as a symbol of bravery, justice and purity. He also venerated his uncle, Saint Louis of Toulouse. On the other hand, he gave importance to the cults of the princesses Saint Elizabeth and Saint Margaret, which added relevance to the lineage inheritance through the feminine branches.

Charles restored the royal power which had fallen into feudal lords&#x27; hands, and then made the lords swear loyalty to him. For this, he founded the Order of Saint George in 1326, which was the first secular chivalric order in the world, and included the most important noblemen of the Kingdom.
Charles married four times. His fourth wife was Elizabeth, the daughter of Władysław I of Poland. When Charles died in 1342, his eldest son by Elizabeth succeeded him as Louis I. In the first years of his reign, Louis was advised closely by his mother, making her one of the most influential personalities in the Kingdom.

Charles had arranged the marriage of his second son, Andrew, with his cousin Joanna, the granddaughter of King Robert of Naples, in 1332. Robert died in 1343, bequeathing his kingdom to Joanna but excluding the claim of Andrew. In 1345, a group of noble Neapolitan conspirators murdered Andrew at Aversa. Almost immediately, Louis declared war on Naples, conducting a first campaign in 1347–1348 and a second in 1350. He eventually signed peace with Joanna in 1352. Louis also waged wars against the Serbian Empire and the Golden Horde, restoring the Hungarian monarchs&#x27; authority over territories along the frontiers which had been lost during the previous decades.

In 1370, Louis&#x27;s uncle, Casimir III of Poland, died without male issue. Louis succeeded him, thus establishing the first union of Hungary and Poland. This lasted until 1382 when Louis himself died without male issue; his two daughters, Mary and Jadwiga, then ascended the thrones of Hungary and Poland respectively.

=====The Age of Sigismund=====
Louis I of Hungary always kept good and close relationships with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg and finally proclaimed Charles&#x27;s son Sigismund of Luxembourg to succeed him as the co-ruler of Louis&#x27; daughter and Sigismund&#x27;s bride, Mary. Initially, Mary reigned as a sole monarch which led to turmoil, perhaps due to gender expectations of the time. Sigismund married her in 1385 and finally became a co-ruler in 1387. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1395, he remained alone on the throne. Sigismund became a renowned king who created many improvements in the Hungarian law system and who rebuilt the palaces of Buda and Visegrád. He brought materials from Austria and Bohemia and ordered the creation of the most luxurious building in all of central Europe. In his laws can be seen the traces of the early mercantilism. He worked hard to keep the nobility under his control. A great part of his reign was dedicated to the fight with the Ottoman Empire, which started to extend its frontiers and influence to Europe. In 1396 was fought the Battle of Nicopolis against the Ottomans, which resulted in a defeat for the Hungarian-French forces led by Sigismund and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu. However, Sigismund continued to successfully contain the Ottoman forces outside of the Kingdom for the rest of his life.

Losing popularity among the Hungarian nobility, Sigismund soon became victim of an attempt against his rule, and Ladislaus of Anjou-Durazzo (the son of the murdered King of Naples Charles II of Hungary) was called in and crowned. Since the ceremony was not performed with the Hungarian Holy Crown, and in the city of Székesfehérvár, it was considered illegitimate. Ladislaus stayed only few days in Hungarian territory and soon left it, no longer an inconvenience for Sigismund. In 1408 he founded the Order of the Dragon, which included most of the relevant monarchs and noblemen of that region of Europe at that time. This was just a first step for what was coming. In 1410, he was elected King of the Romans, making him the supreme monarch over the German territories. He had to deal with the Hussite movement, a religious reformist group that was born in Bohemia, and he presided at the Council of Constance, where the theologist founder Jan Hus, was judged. In 1419, Sigismund inherited the Crown of Bohemia after the death of his brother Wenceslaus of Luxembourg, obtaining the formal control of three medieval states, but he struggled for control of Bohemia until the peace agreement with the Hussites and his coronation in 1436. In 1433, was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope and ruled until his death in 1437, leaving as his only heir his daughter Elizabeth of Luxembourg and her husband. The marriage of Elizabeth was arranged with the Duke Albert V of Austria, who was later crowned as King Albert of Hungary in 1437.

=====Hunyadi family=====

The Hungarian kingdom&#x27;s golden age was during the reign of Matthias Corvinus (1458–1490), the son of John Hunyadi. His nickname was &quot;Matthias the Just&quot;. He further improved the Hungarian economy and practised astute diplomacy in place of military action whenever possible. Matthias did undertake campaigning when necessary. From 1485 until his death, he occupied Vienna, aiming to limit the influence and meddling of the Holy Roman Empire in Hungary&#x27;s affairs.

At the time of the initial Ottoman encroachment, the Hungarians successfully resisted conquest. John Hunyadi was leader of the Crusade of Varna, in which the Hungarians tried to expel the Turks from the Balkans. Initially, they were successful, but later at the Battle of Varna, the Ottomans won a decisive if Pyrrhic victory. Wladyslaw III was decapitated during this battle.

In 1456, John Hunyadi delivered a crushing defeat of the Ottomans at the Siege of Belgrade. The Noon Bell commemorates the fallen Christian warriors. In the 15th century, the Black Army of Hungary was a modern mercenary army, with the Hussars the most skilled troops of the Hungarian cavalry. In 1479, under the leadership of Pál Kinizsi, the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the Battle of Breadfield. The army of Hungary destroyed its enemies almost every time when Matthias was king.

Matthias died without legitimate heir, and was thus succeeded by Vladislaus II Jagiellon (1490–1516), the son of Casimir IV of Poland. In turn, Vladislaus was succeeded by his son Louis II (1516–26).

In 1526, at the Battle of Mohács, the forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Suleiman the Magnificent annihilated the Hungarian army. In trying to escape, Louis II drowned in the Csele Creek. The leader of the Hungarian army, Pál Tomori, also died in the battle.

===Early modern history===
====The divided kingdom====
Due to a serious defeat by the Ottomans (Battle of Mohács), the central authority collapsed. The majority of Hungary&#x27;s ruling elite elected John Zápolya (10 November 1526). A small minority of aristocrats sided with Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, who was Archduke of Austria, and was related to Louis by marriage. Due to previous agreements that the Habsburgs would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without heirs, Ferdinand was elected king by a rump diet in December 1526.

Although the borders shifted frequently during this period, the three parts can be identified, more or less, as follows:
*Royal Hungary, which consisted of northern and western territories where Ferdinand I was recognized as king of Hungary. This part is viewed as defining the continuity of the Kingdom of Hungary. The territory along with Ottoman Hungary suffered greatly from the nearly constant wars taking place.
*Ottoman Hungary: The Great Alföld (i.e. most of present-day Hungary, including south-eastern Transdanubia and the Banat), partly without north-eastern present-day Hungary.
*Eastern Hungarian Kingdom under the Szapolyai. This territory, often under Ottoman influence, was different from Transylvania proper and included various other territories sometimes referred to as Partium. Later the entity was called Principality of Transylvania.
On 29 February 1528, King John I of Hungary received the support of the Ottoman Sultan. A three-sided conflict ensued as Ferdinand moved to assert his rule over as much of the Hungarian kingdom as he could. By 1529 the kingdom had been split into two parts: Habsburg Hungary and the &quot;eastern-Kingdom of Hungary&quot;. At this time there were no Ottomans on Hungarian territories, except Srem&#x27;s important castles. In 1532, Nikola Jurišić defended Kőszeg and stopped a powerful Ottoman army. By 1541, the fall of Buda marked a further division of Hungary into three areas. The country remained divided until the end of the 17th century.

In 1547, the Truce of Adrianople was signed between Charles V and Suleiman the Magnificent. Through this treaty, Ferdinand I of Austria and Charles V recognized total Ottoman control of Hungary, and agreed to pay to the Ottomans a yearly tribute of 30,000 gold florins for their Habsburg possessions in northern and western Hungary.

On 1 May 1566, Suleiman I led an Ottoman invasion of Habsburg-controlled Hungary, the Ottoman forces of which was one of the most sizable armies he had led in his rule of 46 years. After reaching Belgrade and met with John II Sigismund Zápolya on 27 June, Suleiman I learned that a Croatian-Hungarian nobleman, Nikola IV Zrinski, Ban of Croatia, accomplished an attack on an Ottoman military camp at Siklós. Suleiman I held off his attack of Eger for the time being, and began to set off towards Nikola IV Zrinski&#x27;s fortress at Szigetvár. From 2 August to 7 September, the Ottoman forces had laid siege to the fortress with a force, at the least, of 150,000 against Zrinski&#x27;s 2,300 defenders. While the siege turned into a victory for the Ottomans, it came at the cost of: 25,000 Ottoman soldiers and Suleiman I, who before the final battle of Szigetvár, due to natural causes of old age and illness.

In the following centuries there were numerous attempts to push back the Ottoman forces, such as the Long War or Thirteen Years&#x27; War (29 July 1593 – 1604/11 November 1606) led by a coalition of Christian forces. In 1644 the Winter Campaign by Miklós Zrínyi burnt the crucial Suleiman Bridge of Osijek in eastern Slavonia, interrupting a Turkish supply line in Hungary. At the Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664), Austrians and Hungarians defeated the Turkish army.

After the Ottoman siege of Vienna failed in 1683, the Habsburgs went on the offensive against the Turks. By the end of the 17th century, they managed to invade the remainder of the historical Kingdom of Hungary and the principality of Transylvania. For a while in 1686, the capital Buda was again free from the Ottoman Empire, with the aid of other Europeans.

====The Kuruc age====


Rákóczi&#x27;s War for Independence (1703–1711) was the first significant freedom fight in Hungary against absolutist Habsburg rule. It was fought by a group of noblemen, wealthy and high-ranking progressives who wanted to put an end to the inequality of power relations, led by Francis II Rákóczi (II. Rákóczi Ferenc in Hungarian). Its main aims were to protect the rights of the different social orders, and to ensure the economic and social development of the country. Due to the adverse balance of forces, the political situation in Europe and internal conflicts the freedom fight was eventually suppressed, but it succeeded in keeping Hungary from becoming an integral part of the Habsburg Empire, and its constitution was kept, even though it was only a formality.

After the departure of the Ottomans, the Habsburgs dominated the Hungarian Kingdom. The Hungarians&#x27; renewed desire for freedom led to Rákóczi&#x27;s War for Independence. The most important reasons of the war were the new and higher taxes and a renewed Protestant movement. Rákóczi was a Hungarian nobleman, son of the legendary heroine &quot;Ilona Zrínyi&quot;. He spent a part of his youth in Austrian captivity. The &quot;Kurucs&quot; were troops of Rákóczi. Initially, the Kuruc army attained several important victories due to their superior light cavalry. Their weapons were mostly pistols, light sabre and &quot;fokos&quot;. At the Battle of Saint Gotthard (1705), János Bottyán decisively defeated the Austrian army. The Hungarian colonel Ádám Balogh nearly captured Joseph I, the King of Hungary and Archduke of Austria.

In 1708, the Habsburgs finally defeated the main Hungarian army at Battle of Trencsén, and this diminished the further effectiveness of the Kuruc army. While the Hungarians were exhausted by the fights, the Austrians defeated the French army in the War of the Spanish Succession. They could send more troops to Hungary against the rebels. Transylvania became part of Hungary again starting at the end of the 17th century, and was led by governors.

====Age of Enlightenment====
In 1711, Austrian Emperor Charles VI became the next ruler of Hungary. Throughout the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary had its own diet (parliament) and constitution, but the members of the Governor&#x27;s Council (&quot;Helytartótanács&quot;, the office of the palatine) were appointed by the Habsburg monarch, and the superior economic institution, the Hungarian Chamber, was directly subordinated to the Court Chamber in Vienna.

The Hungarian language reform started under the reign of Joseph II. The reform age of Hungary was started by István Széchenyi a Hungarian noble, who built one of the greatest bridges of Hungary, the Széchenyi Chain Bridge. The official language remained Latin until 1836, when Hungarian was introduced. Between 1844 and 1849, and from 1867 onward, Hungarian became the exclusively used official language.

==== Hungarian Revolution of 1848 ====
The European revolutions of 1848 swept into Hungary, as well. The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 sought to redress the long suppressed desire for political change, namely independence. The Hungarian National Guard was created by young Hungarian patriots in 1848. In literature, this was best expressed by the greatest poet of the revolution, Sándor Petőfi.

As war broke out with Austria, Hungarian military successes, which included the campaigns of the Hungarian general, Artúr Görgey, forced the Austrians on the defensive. One of the most famous battles of the revolution, the Battle of Pákozd, was fought on 29 September 1848, when the Hungarian revolutionary army led by Lieutenant-General János Móga defeated the troops of the Croatian Ban Josip Jelačić. Fearing defeat, the Austrians pleaded for Russian help. The combined forces of the two empires quelled the revolution. The desired political changes of 1848 were again suppressed until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.

=== Austria-Hungary (1867–1918) ===
Following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Habsburg Monarchy became the &quot;dual monarchy&quot; of Austria-Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the existence of the Dual Monarchy. Technological change accelerated industrialization and urbanization. The capitalist way of production spread throughout the Empire during its fifty-year existence and obsolete medieval institutions continued to disappear. By the early 20th century, most of the Empire began to experience rapid economic growth. The GNP per capita grew roughly 1.45% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1.00%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).

The lands of the Hungarian Crown (comprising the Kingdom of Hungary proper, into which Transylvania was fully incorporated, and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, which maintained a distinct identity and internal autonomy) were granted equal status with the Austrian Empire. Each of the two states comprising Austria-Hungary exercised considerable independence, with certain institutions, notably the reigning house, defence, foreign affairs, and finances for common expenditures, remaining under joint management. This arrangement lasted until 1918, when the Central Powers went down in defeat in World War I.

===Transitions (1918 to 1920)===

====Two short-lived republics====
The Hungarian Soviet Republic or Hungarian Republic of Councils ( or &quot;Magyarországi Szocialista Szövetséges Tanácsköztársaság&quot;) was a short-lived independent communist state established in Hungary.

It lasted only from 21 March until 1 August 1919. The state was led by Béla Kun and was not recognized by France, the UK or the US. It was the second socialist state in the world to be formed after the October Revolution in Russia brought the Bolsheviks to power. The Hungarian Republic of Councils had military conflicts with the Kingdom of Romania (see Hungarian–Romanian War), the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the evolving Czechoslovakia. It collapsed on 1 August 1919 when Hungarians sent representatives to negotiate their surrender to the Romanian forces and Béla Kun, together with other high-ranking Communists, fled to Austria.

A 1919 attempt to form a federation with the Kingdom of Romania also failed, when the Romanian King ultimately refused to accept the Hungarian Crown.

====The restoration of the Kingdom====

After the pullout of occupation forces of Romania in 1920 the country went into civil conflict, with Hungarian anti-communists and monarchists purging the nation of communists and others by whom they felt threatened. On 29 February 1920, after the pullout of the last of the Romanian occupation forces, the Kingdom of Hungary was restored, a coalition of right-wing political forces united and reinstated Hungary&#x27;s status as a constitutional monarchy. Selection of the new King was delayed due to civil infighting, and a regent was appointed to represent the monarchy, former Austro-Hungarian navy admiral Miklós Horthy.

====Treaty of Trianon (1920)====
The new borders set in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon ceded 72% of the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary to the neighbouring states. The main beneficiaries were Romania, the newly formed states of Czechoslovakia, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but Austria, Poland and Italy also gained smaller territories. The areas that were allocated to neighbouring countries in total (and each of them separately) possessed a majority of non-Hungarian population, but more than 3.3 million ethnic Hungarians were left outside the new borders of Hungary. Many view this as contrary to the terms laid out by US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, which were intended to honour the ethnic makeup of the territories. As President Wilson left the conference to emphasize his disagreement, and because the US Congress did not ratify the treaty, the United States of America and the Kingdom of Hungary signed a separate peace treaty on 29 August 1921.

===Between 1920 and 1946===
====Interwar period====

The new international borders separated Hungary&#x27;s industrial base from its sources of raw materials and its former markets for agricultural and industrial products. Hungary lost 84% of its timber resources, 43% of its arable land, and 83% of its iron ore. Furthermore, post-Trianon Hungary possessed 90% of the engineering and printing industry of the Kingdom, while only 11% of timber and 16% iron was retained. In addition, 61% of arable land, 74% of public road, 65% of canals, 62% of railroads, 64% of hard surface roads, 83% of pig iron output, 55% of industrial plants, 100% of gold, silver, copper, mercury and salt mines, and 67% of credit and banking institutions of the prewar Kingdom of Hungary lay within the territory of Hungary&#x27;s neighbors.

Because most of the country&#x27;s pre-war industry was concentrated near Budapest, Hungary retained about 51% of its industrial population and 56% of its industry. Horthy appointed Count Pál Teleki as Prime Minister in July 1920. His government issued a numerus clausus law, limiting admission of &quot;political insecure elements&quot; (these were often Jews) to universities and, in order to quiet rural discontent, took initial steps towards fulfilling a promise of major land reform by dividing about 3,850 km2 from the largest estates into smallholdings. Teleki&#x27;s government resigned, however, after Charles IV unsuccessfully attempted to retake Hungary&#x27;s throne in March 1921. The return of King Charles produced split parties between conservatives who favored a Habsburg restoration and nationalist right-wing radicals who supported election of a Hungarian king. Count István Bethlen, a non-affiliated right-wing member of the parliament, took advantage of this rift forming a new Party of Unity under his leadership. Horthy then appointed Bethlen prime minister. Charles IV died soon after he failed a second time to reclaim the throne in October 1921. (For more detail, see &quot;Charles IV of Hungary&#x27;s attempts to retake the throne&quot;.)
As prime minister, Bethlen dominated Hungarian politics between 1921 and 1931. He fashioned a political machine by amending the electoral law, providing jobs in the expanding bureaucracy to his supporters, and manipulating elections in rural areas. Bethlen restored order to the country by giving the radical counterrevolutionaries payoffs and government jobs in exchange for ceasing their campaign of terror against Jews and leftists. In 1921, he made a deal with the Social Democrats and trade unions (called Bethlen-Peyer Pact), agreeing, among other things, to legalize their activities and free political prisoners in return for their pledge to refrain from spreading anti-Hungarian propaganda, calling political strikes, and organizing the peasantry. Bethlen brought Hungary into the League of Nations in 1922 and out of international isolation by signing a treaty of friendship with Italy in 1927. The revision of the Treaty of Trianon rose to the top of Hungary&#x27;s political agenda and the strategy employed by Bethlen consisted by strengthening the economy and building relations with stronger nations. Revision of the treaty had such a broad backing in Hungary that Bethlen used it, at least in part, to deflect criticism of his economic, social, and political policies.

The Great Depression induced a drop in the standard of living and the political mood of the country shifted further toward the right. In 1932 Horthy appointed a new prime-minister, Gyula Gömbös, who changed the course of Hungarian policy towards closer cooperation with Germany. Gömbös signed a trade agreement with Germany that drew Hungary&#x27;s economy out of depression but made Hungary dependent on the German economy for both raw materials and markets. On 2 November 1938, as the result of the First Vienna Award parts of Czechoslovakia – Southern Slovakia and a part of Carpathian Ruthenia – were returned to Hungary, an area amounting to 11,927 km2 and a population of 869,299 (86.5% of which were Hungarians according to the 1941 census). Between 5 November and 10 November, Hungarian armed forces peacefully occupied the newly transferred territories. Hitler later promised to transfer all of Slovakia to Hungary in exchange for a military alliance, but his offer was rejected. Instead, Horthy chose to pursue a territorial revision to be decided along ethnic lines. In March 1939, the Czecho-Slovak Republic was dissolved, Germany invaded it, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was established. On 14 March, Slovakia declared itself to be an independent state.

On 15 March, Carpatho-Ukraine declared itself to be an independent state. Hungary rejected the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine and, between 14 March and 18 March, Hungarian armed forces occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and ousted the government of Avgustyn Voloshyn. By contrast, Hungary recognized the Nazi puppet state of Slovakia led by the Clerical Fascist Jozef Tiso. In September 1940, with troops massing on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border, war was averted by the Second Vienna Award. This award transferred the northern half of Transylvania to Hungary, with a total area of 43,492 km2 and a total population of 2,578,100 with a 53.5% Hungarian majority according to the 1941 census. By dividing Transylvania between Romania and Hungary, Hitler was able to ease tensions in Hungary. In October 1940, the Germans initiated a reciprocity policy between Romania and Hungary which was continued until the end of World War II. The region of Sub-Carpathia was given special autonomous status with the intention that (eventually) it would be self-governed by the Ruthenian minority.

====During World War II 1941–1945====


After being granted part of southern Czechoslovakia and Subcarpathia by the Germans and Italians in the First Vienna Award of 1938, and then northern Transylvania in the Second Vienna Award of 1940, Hungary participated in their first military maneuvers on the side of the Axis powers in 1941. Thus, the Hungarian army was part of the invasion of Yugoslavia, gaining some more territory and joining the Axis powers in the process. On 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Hungary joined the German effort and declared war on the Soviet Union on 26 June, and entered World War II on the side of the Axis. In late 1941, the Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front experienced success at the Battle of Uman. By 1943, after the Royal Hungarian Army suffered extremely heavy losses at the river Don, the Hungarian government sought to negotiate a surrender with the Allies. On 19 March 1944, as a result of this duplicity, German troops occupied Hungary in what was known as Operation Margarethe. By then it was clear that Hungarian politics would be suppressed according to Hitler&#x27;s intention to hold the country in the war on the side of the Nazi Third Reich because of its strategic location. On 15 October 1944, Horthy made a token effort to disengage Hungary from the war. The Germans launched Operation Panzerfaust and Horthy&#x27;s regime was replaced by a fascist puppet government under the pro-German Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Szálasi, thus effectively ending the possibility for independent actions in the war. However, the form of government was only changed to a republic two years later.

====Transitioning into a republic====
Following its occupation of Hungary in 1944, the Soviet Union imposed harsh conditions allowing the Soviets to seize important material assets and control internal affairs. After the Red Army set up police organs to persecute 
&quot;class enemies&quot;, the Soviets assumed that the impoverished Hungarian populace would support the Communists in the coming elections. The Communists fared poorly, receiving only 17% of the vote, resulting in a coalition government under Prime Minister Zoltán Tildy. Soviet intervention, however, resulted in a government that disregarded Tildy, placed communists in important ministries, and imposed restrictive and repressive measures, including banning the victorious Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party. In 1945, Soviet Marshal Kliment Voroshilov forced the freely elected Hungarian government to yield the Interior Ministry to a nominee of the Hungarian Communist Party. Communist Interior Minister László Rajk established the ÁVH secret police, which suppressed political opposition through intimidation, false accusations, imprisonment and torture. In 1946 the form of government was changed to a republic. Soon after the monarchy was abolished, the Soviet Union pressed Hungarian leader Mátyás Rákosi to take a &quot;line of more pronounced class struggle.&quot; What emerged was a communist state lasting until 23 October 1956 when the Soviet occupation was swept away by the Hungarian uprising, victorious until 10 November 1956. The Soviet occupation was then restored, lasting until 1989 when the Communists agreed to give up their monopoly on power, paving the way for free elections in March 1990. In today&#x27;s republic, the Kingdom is regarded as one long stage in the development of the state. This sense of continuity is reflected in the republic&#x27;s national symbols such as the Holy Crown of Hungary and the coat of arms of Hungary, which are the same as when the monarchy was still in place. Several holidays, the official language (Hungarian), and the capital city Budapest have also been retained. The official Hungarian name of the country is (simply Hungary) since 2012; it was also the common name of the monarchy. The millennium of the Hungarian statehood was commemorated in 2000 and codified by the Millennium Act of 2000.

<text>iRiver, stylized IRIVER and formerly as iriver, is a South Korean consumer electronics division owned by Dreamus which markets music and other accessories in its domestic market.

The company, then officially known as ReignCom, was created in 1999 by seven former Samsung executives, initially releasing portable CD players and later widely known in the 2000s for a line of digital audio players and other portable media devices. In 2019, the company was rebranded as Dreamus.

== History ==

In 1999, Duk-Jun Yang and Rae-Hwan Lee left Samsung Electronics, along with five colleagues. They formed ReignCom, with Yang as CEO, originally as a semiconductor distributor, then decided to capitalize on the growing MP3 player market. They decided to outsource manufacturing to AV Chaseway, in Shenzhen, China, and contract product design to INNO Design, an industrial design company in Palo Alto, California, while keeping R&amp;D in-house.

The company&#x27;s first iRiver product was the iMP-100, a portable CD player capable of decoding MP3 data files on CDs, released in November 2000. It and a later model, the iMP-250, were rebranded and sold by SONICblue in the United States under the Rio Volt name. iRiver sold later models with its own SlimX brand, billing them as the thinnest MP3 CD players in the world. By now, iRiver portable CD players had achieved high domestic popularity and were also popular elsewhere. iRiver was one of a number of South Korean companies who were dominating the worldwide MP3 industry in these early years.

===2002–2005===

In 2002, iRiver scrambled to develop its first flash memory player to meet demand from the U.S. Best Buy chain. This led to the release of their first DAP product, the iFP-100 &quot;Prism&quot; - named as such because of its distinctive shape designed by its design firm partner, INNO Design. By the end of the year, iRiver had already gained as much as 20% of the domestic market and was steadily increasing popularity in foreign markets. A year later, it was first to market with 512 MB and 1 GB flash players with its iFP-500 &quot;Masterpiece&quot; player. It had also completed its IPO at KOSDAQ, a Korean stock exchange. The company was also selling hard drive players to compete with the iPod: the iHP-300 followed by the H300.

iRiver rose to the No. 1 position in the global market of flash players. Its global market share overall was 14.1% in 2003, while Apple led with 21.6%. The marketing of iRiver America was mostly spent on PR and brand partnerships, featuring celebrities such as Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg.
By 2004, iRiver had gained solid market share in the digital audio player market in both the United States and Japan, and sold a total of 2.8 million players worldwide, of which 1.7 million was in the overseas market. During this time, the company went through a rebranding, including changing the styling of its name from iRiver to iriver, and using a ruby-red themed logo in place of blue. It also used adult film star Jenna Jameson and an Audrey Hepburn lookalike as spokesmodels promoting its products.

In 2005, the company decided to focus entirely on flash players like the H10, and the development of jukeboxes (except from the 20 GB version of the H10) was stopped as a result. The launch of Apple&#x27;s iPod Shuffle hurt iriver sales and it dropped from the top ranking in flash-based players. iriver adopted a new marketing strategy in 2005, attempting to grab mindshare from Apple. It referred to the U10 flash player as the &quot;thumb thing&quot;. This referred to users controlling their MP3 devices with their thumbs, just as they do their cell phones and text messaging devices. The company also announced plans for digital audio players featuring Internet telephony.

iRiver&#x27;s U.S. unit, based in Vancouver, Washington, held 3.4% of the U.S. MP3 player market in 2005, according to IDC; this was down from a peak of 13%. The company targeted early adopters among American users as it tried to regain dominance of the category. It also opened sales divisions in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan. iRiver&#x27;s parent Reigncom made significant financial losses by the end of 2005.

===2006–2010===

ReignCom announced in May 2006 that it would adjust its focus toward hand-held mobile gaming and other electronics, publicly reporting its intentions of quitting the PMP market.
It has also reported sluggish sales for its music player business, including a loss of 35.58 billion won (US$36.68 million) in 2005, compared with a net profit of 43.46 billion won in 2004. In its South Korean home market, iRiver once accounted for 50% of sales and the company has bought ads claiming its products are a symbol of patriotism. It has also operated a small chain of &quot;iRiver Zone&quot; stores, with locations in Korea, Japan, and China. The Incheon International Airport shop features a large heart-shaped art piece, which represents the corporate &quot;Heartbeat Philosophy&quot; of &quot;dedication to its customers&quot;. Its European market share had dropped to 0.4% in 2006, down from 1.3% the year prior, and it had also fallen in Japan and the US.

In 2006, the company had sales of 149.5 billion won and an operating loss of 54.4 billion won. The next year, until 2014, South Korean private equity firm Vogo Fund held a large stake in iRiver, which reported 5.5 billion won in profits on 206.8 billion won of sales, working to improve the company&#x27;s prospects as its MP3 player business has dwindled. Deep losses followed in 2009 and 2010.

In May 2007, Reigncom announced a new division, Reigncom USA, to manage the iriver brand in the United States and help develop new products. The company also bought the Siren brand in Japan from A-MAX Japan, despite protests from Siren Inc. itself.

In 2009, its parent company renamed itself to iRiver. The brand expanded to other products including the Dicple series of electronic dictionaries in South Korea and the iRiver Story e-book reader.

===2011–present===
The iRiver Story reader was released in 2010 and was followed by the Cover Story. The Story HD successor was launched in 2011 which was also iriver&#x27;s first e-book reader in the American market. That same year, iriver launched its first Android smartphone and tablet in the domestic market.

iRiver was sold to SK Telecom in 2014.

In 2013, iRiver launched the premium brand of Astell &amp; Kern. As the digital music player market had changed, Astell &amp; Kern consisted of premium products instead of iriver&#x27;s older conventional players.

In 2019, the iRiver company changed its name to Dreamus.

==Products==
=== Digital audio players ===

iriver&#x27;s products can all play MP3 and WMA audio files. Some units support text viewing, Ogg Vorbis audio files, Macromedia Flash, and/or BMP files. The company also supported Microsoft PlaysForSure, which allowed some products to support subscription-based music download services, including URGE, Napster, Rhapsody, and Yahoo! Music Unlimited. It also let users disable its DRM functionality.

Many players support multilingual display. They support Winamp playlists and allow repeat, shuffle play and programmable functions. Several preset and one user-defined EQ settings are included, plus a built-in FM tuner. A nearly unique feature of some iriver players was the direct MP3-recording capability with selectable bitrate of internal (FM, microphone) and external (line) sources.

Most iRiver players include a unique feature called &quot;study mode&quot;. Users can quickly jump back and forth within tracks by a certain time interval, set from three to 180 seconds in current models. The option was designed to help people listening to recorded language lessons. SonicBlue removed this feature from its rebranded Rio Volt models, causing some users to hack their players with iRiver firmware from other regions.

Initially connecting devices to the computer for music transfer required the iRiver Music Manager. In later firmwares UMS is supported so that the computer&#x27;s native file explorer could be used to transfer files. Iriver eventually dropped UMS support for the U10, T30, T20 and T10 models in favor of Microsoft&#x27;s MTP. The company later released an official &quot;Firmware Updater&quot; that allows users to switch between the MTP and UMS interfaces.

<text>Pennsylvania Hospital is a private, non-profit, 515-bed teaching hospital located at 800 Spruce Street in Center City Philadelphia, The hospital was founded on May 11, 1751 by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, and was the second established public hospital (first was Bellevue) but had the first surgical amphitheatre in the United States. and its first medical library. It is part of the University of Pennsylvania Health System.

The hospital&#x27;s main building, dating to 1756, is a National Historic Landmark.

==History==
===18th century===
Pennsylvania Hospital was originally conceived in 1751 by Thomas Bond as an institution &quot;for the reception and cure of the sick poor...free of charge. It was funded by &quot;matching grant&quot; to donations of the people of Philadelphia by a bill, which the House passed unanimously on February 7, 1750. Franklin later wrote that, &quot;I do not remember any of my political Manoeuvres, the Success of which gave me at the time more Pleasure.&quot; On September 2, 1751, Mathias Koplin donated the first plot of ground for the new hospital.

The first building at the hospital was opened on February 6, 1752, on High Street (now Market Street). Elizabeth Gardner, a Quaker widow, was appointed Matron of the hospital. As the hospital received support of the leading families in Philadelphia, its permanence was secured, and Samuel Rhoads was appointed architect of the new building.

Thomas Stretch was among the leading citizens of Philadelphia and one of the founders of Pennsylvania Hospital. He was a member of the Union Fire Company, also known as Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s Bucket Brigade and a founder of the social club known as Schuylkill Fishing Company, and the club&#x27;s first governor in 1732, re-elected annually until his death in 1765. Stretch was a director of the Philadelphia Contributionship (Hand-in-Hand fire mark) from 1758 to 1761.

In the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; of May 29, 1755, Thomas Stretch appears as one of the largest subscribers with Benjamin Franklin and others to the fund for the Pennsylvania Hospital. The Stretch family and Benjamin Franklin each provided half of the original capital to fund the hospital. The list of subscribers reads:

Thomas Stretch and Joseph Stretch were sons of Peter Stretch (1670–1746) and Margery Hall Stretch (1668–1746). It is likely the reference to Isaac Stretch is to Isaac Stretch (1714–1770), son of Daniel Stretch (1694–1746), another son of Peter and Margery Stretch. The Stretch family were Quakers.

Joseph Stretch, mentioned above, was at this time &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Collector of Excise for the City and County of Philadelphia&quot;, as may be seen from a notice in the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; of October 28, 1756; and subsequently, in 1768, he was &quot;His Majesty’s Collector of Customs, etc., for the Port of Philadelphia&quot;. Robert Harding was pastor of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church.

In 1755, the cornerstone was laid for the East Wing of what would become the hospital&#x27;s permanent location at 8th and Pine Streets. All of the patients were transferred from the temporary hospital to the permanent hospital on December 17, 1756. The first admission of a new patient occurred on the following day. The site continued to grow through the years with the addition of more wings; the West Wing of the building was built in 1796, and buildings, extra land, and further expansion have since been added.

===19th century===
While attending clinics in the Pennsylvania Hospital in November 1869, the first time women students attended the hospital, Anna Lukens and a Miss Brumall led a line of women students out of the hospital grounds amid hisses, jeers, insults, and thrown stones and mud from male students.

Pennsylvania Hospital gained a reputation as a center of innovation and medical advancement, particularly in the area of maternity. It was a teaching hospital from its very beginning, when Bond would lead rounds through what is now the east wing of the main building. In its early years it was also known for its particularly advanced and humane facilities for mentally ill patients at a time when mental illness was very poorly understood and patients were often treated very badly. Care of the mentally ill was removed to West Philadelphia in 1841 with the construction of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, later known as The Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital. Under superintendent Thomas Story Kirkbride, the hospital developed a treatment philosophy that became the standard for care of the mentally ill in the 19th century.

===20th century===
In 1950, Pennsylvania Hospital was recognized for becoming more highly specialized as it established, in addition to its sophisticated maternity programs, an intensive care unit for neurological patients, a coronary care unit, an orthopaedic institute, a diabetes center, a hospice, specialized units in oncology and urology and broadened surgical programs.

The hospital has served as a center for treating the war wounded. Patients were brought to the hospital for treatment in the Revolutionary War, the American Civil War and the Spanish–American War, and units from the hospital were sent abroad to treat wounded in World War I and in World War II (to the Pacific theater).

The seal of the hospital, chosen by Franklin and Bond, incorporates the story of the Good Samaritan; the phrase &quot;Take Care of Him and I will repay Thee&quot; is used on it.

In 1996, Patricia A. Ford established the bloodless medicine program at Pennsylvania Hospital and performed the first successful bloodless stem-cell transplant.

In 1997, Pennsylvania Hospital&#x27;s Board of Managers made the decision to merge with the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The large health system helps to support the formerly stand-alone hospital with its network of resources.

===21st century===
In 2001, Pennsylvania Hospital celebrated its 250th anniversary. The Center for Transfusion-Free Medicine at Pennsylvania Hospital has evolved into a major national bloodless center that treats more than 1300 inpatients per year.

==Reputation==
According to US News &amp; World Report Pennsylvania Hospital is ranked 7th among hospitals in the state of Pennsylvania and 3rd among 12 hospitals ranked in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. It also achieved a high-performing status across six subspecialties. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology was ranked 45th in the nation among 4,855 hospitals. The 2018 Becker&#x27;s Hospital Review listed the internal medicine residency program at Pennsylvania Hospital 19th in the country. According to the Doximity residency internal medicine rankings, in the category &quot;Reputation&quot; Pennsylvania Hospital is 28th in the country of 620 programs. According to the Doximity residency Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology rankings, in the category &quot;Reputation&quot; Pennsylvania Hospital is 48th in the country of 298 programs.

==Historic firsts==
===Historic library===

In 1762, the first book for the hospital&#x27;s medical library was donated by John Fothergill, a British friend of Franklin&#x27;s. In 1847, the American Medical Association designated the library as the first, largest, and most important medical library in the United States. That year, in 1847, the library contained about 9,000 volumes. The collection now contains over 13,000 volumes dating back to the 15th century—including medical and scientific volumes as well as books on natural history. The library includes the nation&#x27;s most complete collection of medical books published between 1750 and 1850. The collection also contains several incunabula, books written before 1501, when the printed process was invented.

===Surgical amphitheater===

The top floor of Pennsylvania Hospital is the home of the nation&#x27;s oldest surgical amphitheater, which served as the operating room from 1804 through 1868. Surgeries were performed on sunny days between 11:00 am and 2:00 pm since there was no electricity at the time. The surgical amphitheater seats 180 and with those standing, up to 300 people might be present during any given surgical operation.

===Physic garden===
The Board of Managers first proposed the Physic Garden in 1774 to provide physicians with ingredients for medicines. The idea was approved, but financial circumstances intervened and the project was delayed for two centuries. In 1976, the planting of the garden was the bicentennial project of the Philadelphia Committee of the Garden Club of America and the Friends of Pennsylvania Hospital. Located in front of the Pine Building&#x27;s West Wing, the garden has plants that were once used for medicines to stimulate the heart, ease toothaches, relieve indigestion, and cleanse wounds in the 18th century.

===Maternity firsts===
Pennsylvania Hospital is noted for its many firsts in the area of women&#x27;s medicine, especially in maternity. In 1803, the hospital established a &quot;lying-in&quot; (or maternity) department. This lasted until 1854 when obstetrics and gynecology took a 75-year break at the hospital. The specialties were reinstated in 1929 with the opening of the Woman&#x27;s Building (now the Spruce Building) which sported 150 adult beds, 80 bassinets, 2 operating rooms, a series of labor and delivery rooms, and outpatient clinics. It was considered &quot;one of the most modern hospital buildings in the country&quot; especially at a time when women&#x27;s medicine was not thought to be very important and most births were still done at home. This was followed in 1978 with the first Antenatal Testing Unit (ATU) in the region and in 1985 when the first GIFT (Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer) pregnancy in Philadelphia was achieved at the hospital. In 1987, Pennsylvania Hospital achieved two obstetrical firsts: the first birthing suite in a tertiary care hospital in the state was opened, and the first gestational carrier and egg donor programs in the Delaware Valley were begun to complement the hospital&#x27;s existing fertility services. In 1995, the hospital was the first in the region to achieve 1,000 live births from in-vitro fertilization, GIFT, and other assisted reproductive technologies.

<text>Thérèse de Couagne (19 January 1697 – 26 February 1764) was a capitalist and slave owner who played an active role in the economy of New France.

Thérèse de Couagne was born on 19 January 1697 in Montreal, New France. She was the daughter of Charles de Couagne, a merchant trader, and Marie Gaudé She died on 26 February 1764 at the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal. She was married to François Poulin de Francheville on 27 November 1718 and became a widow on 28 November 1733. She became interested in business after her husband died.

She also inherited ownership of the slave Marie-Joseph Angélique, who was convicted of setting de Couagne&#x27;s house on alight, starting the fire of Montreal in 1734. Though Angélique was executed, contemporary historians are unsure of who set the fire.

<text>The Battle of the Kentish Knock (or the Battle of the Zealand Approaches) was a naval battle between the fleets of the Dutch Republic and England, fought on 28 September 1652 (8 October Gregorian calendar), during the First Anglo-Dutch War near the shoal called the Kentish Knock in the North Sea about thirty kilometres east of the mouth of the river Thames. The Dutch fleet, internally divided on political, regional and personal grounds, proved incapable of making a determined effort and was soon forced to withdraw, losing two ships and many casualties. In Dutch the action is called the &quot;Slag bij de Hoofden&quot;.

==Backgrounds==
Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp had been suspended by the States-General of the Netherlands after his failure to bring the English to battle off the Shetland Islands in August, and replaced as supreme commander of the confederate Dutch fleet by the Hollandic Vice-Admiral Witte de With of the Admiralty of the Maze. This caused an immediate rift between the provinces of Holland and Zealand as De With was the personal enemy of the commander of the Zealandic fleet, Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen, who himself had quit service because of a conflict with the States-General. Earlier tensions had been moderated by the fact that both Tromp and Evertsen were staunch Orangists, but De With was a loyal servant of the States regime that had dominated Dutch politics since the death of stadtholder William II of Orange.
De With, having for months advocated a more aggressive naval policy aimed at destroying the enemy fleet instead of passively defending the merchant convoys against English attack, now saw an opportunity to concentrate his forces and gain control of the seas. He set out to attack the English fleet at anchor at The Downs near Dover, departing from the Schooneveld on 25 September 1652, and joined the squadron of Vice-Commodore Michiel de Ruyter. The fleet was immediately hit by a storm damaging many vessels. De With also had to protect the trade routes and discovered that nine of De Ruyter&#x27;s ships, that had been on sea for two months, had to return to port for repairs. De Ruyter suggested that under the circumstances it was better to simply keep luring away the English from merchant fleets while declining to really fight, but De With insisted on delivering a decisive battle, stating: &quot;I shall lustily lead the fleet to the enemy; the devil may bring it back again!&quot;.

==Battle==
When the fleets finally met on 28 September, the United Provinces had 62 ships and about 1,900 cannon and 7,000 men; the Commonwealth of England 68 ships under General at Sea Robert Blake with about 2,400 cannon and 10,000 men. The van of the Dutch fleet was to be commanded by Michiel de Ruyter, the centre by De With himself and the rear by temporary Rear-Admiral Gideon de Wildt of the Admiralty of Amsterdam.

On the morning of 28 September the Dutch fleet, approaching from the east, had the previous evening been again scattered by a gale and was still dispersed when around noon it saw Blake coming out in force from the south. Having the weather gauge because of a south-south-western breeze, Blake intended to exploit this excellent opportunity for a direct attack on the disordered Dutch.

Having hurriedly assembled his force around 14:30, with the exception of five vessels that had drifted too far to the north, De With now wanted to transfer his flag from the smaller &quot;Prinses Louise&quot; to the &quot;Brederode&quot;, Tromp&#x27;s former flagship and the most powerful vessel of the Dutch fleet. However, to his mortification, Tromp&#x27;s crew refused to let him on board, addressing De With the invective &#x27;green cheese&#x27; and even threatening to fire a salvo on his boat if he did not stop waving around his commission papers from the States-General: he had a very bad reputation among common sailors – indeed hundreds had already deserted when it became known he would be supreme commander. Zealandic Commodore Cornelis Evertsen the Elder, the brother of Johan Evertsen, was called in to negotiate but to no avail. When the enemy fleet was within half a mile distance, De With was forced to hoist his flag on the large but slow VOC-ship &quot;Prins Willem&quot; where he found the majority of its officers drunk and the crew to be consisting of untrained men.

Action was joined at about 17:00 when Blake, himself moving his flag from the too large &quot;Sovereign&quot; to the more manoeuvrable &quot;Resolution&quot;, engaged the Dutch. Blake intended to break the Dutch line, but on the approach of the English fleet the mass of Dutch ships began to give way to the east. At the same time the wind slackened considerably. As a result, both fleets slowly passed each other in opposite tack. This was very unfavourable for the Dutch; normally being in a leeward position would have given them a longer range, but with such gentle winds this advantage was absent while the English ships were larger and better armed than their opponents, inflicting severe damage. Nevertheless, some English ships at first got into trouble: the &quot;Sovereign&quot; and &quot;James&quot; ran aground on the Kentish Knock sandbank and only with much difficulty worked themselves free; the &quot;Resolution&quot; and the &quot;Dolphin&quot;, venturing too far forward, became isolated and surrounded but were saved by the encroachment by the other English vessels. The &quot;Prins Willem&quot; was disabled, meaning that De With was greatly hampered in his efforts to lead his forces. But soon, by 19:00, the fighting stopped due to the onset of darkness, the fleets just having finished this single manoeuvre. At this moment one Dutch ship, the &quot;Maria&quot;, had been captured while another captured ship, the &quot;Gorcum&quot;, was abandoned by the English in a sinking condition but re-occupied and saved by the Dutch. The &quot;Burgh van Alkmaar&quot; blew up. Several Dutch ships, their morale shaken by the devastating English fire, left their formation.

The next day, early in the morning, about ten Dutch ships, mostly commanded by captains from Zealand who resented the domination of Holland and severely disliked De With, had broken off the engagement and simply sailed home. This is usually attributed to the fact that De With in the battle council in the morning of the second day had called all Zealandic captains cowards and had warned them that in &quot;Holland&quot; there was still sufficient wood left to erect gallows for any of them. The situation had become hopeless for the Dutch who now had 49 ships left in their fleet while the English fleet had during the night been reinforced to 84, yet De With still wanted to make a last effort.

On his directions the Dutch fleet, now positioned to the southeast of the English force, sailed farther south in the hope of gaining the weather gauge. This design failed however: first some ships, with difficulty beating up the wind, coursed too far to the west and were badly mauled by the fire of the English rear; and hardly had the Dutch fleet moved to its intended position when it all proved to have been in vain because the wind turned to the northeast, giving the English the weather gauge again. Michiel de Ruyter and Cornelis Evertsen now managed to convince De With to accept the inevitable and the Dutch fleet late in the afternoon withdrew to the east followed by Blake; as De With angrily described it: &quot;like a herd of sheep fleeing the wolves&quot;. Assisted by a westerly De With and De Ruyter nicely covered the retreat with a dozen ships and the Dutch would not lose any more vessels.

The English fleet halted its pursuit when the Flemish shoals were reached; De With now decided to quickly repair the fleet at sea in the Wielingen basin and then make another attempt at defeating the enemy. This order was met with utter disbelief by his fellow flag officers. De Ruyter tactfully pointed out: &quot;Such courage is too perilous&quot;. Understanding he was alone in his opinion De With at last agreed to withdraw the fleet to Hellevoetsluis, where it arrived on 2 October (12 October).

==Aftermath==
The Dutch recognized after their defeat that they needed larger ships to take on the English, and instituted a major building program of sixty ships that would only be completed some years after the conflict, first seeing action in the opening stages of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. According to De With this, besides a lack of a sufficient number of fireships, had been the main cause of the Dutch failure; he pointed out that many a light English frigate could outshoot the average Dutch warship. However, according to public opinion there was only one to blame for the defeat: De With himself. As one of the more polite pamphlets put it, a week after the battle:

:&quot;From this disorder and unwillingness to fight it can be seen and noticed what difference it makes whether one has or appoints a Head of a fleet who is judicious, polite and popular – or whether one imposes on the men a Head who is unloved, despised by the men and unsavoury to them. Vice-Admiral De Witt is, we all know this, an excellent soldier and bold Sailor, who fears no danger, nor even death itself. Likewise Commodore de Ruyter is an audacious and fearless Hero, who would not hesitate to engage the worst of enemies, heeding no danger. Notwithstanding all of this, we also know that Admiral Tromp possesses all these same qualities; and besides these uncommon virtues: of being an extraordinary careful, Godfearing and virtuous man who does not call his men dogs, devils, or devil&#x27;s brood; but children, friends, comrades and similar loving and endearing words to address them with. By which he so much endears those serving under him that they, as they say, would go through fire for him and risk their lives, yes, by manner of speech, would not hesitate to fight the devil. If such a loved and respected Head is then kept from the fleet and replaced by those who displease the men, now it is shown what calamity and disaster this brings with it.&quot;

The same evening of the 12th the States-General learned of the defeat, they sent a letter to both Tromp and Johan Evertsen, asking them to return.

The English believed that the Dutch had been all but defeated, and sent twenty ships away to the Mediterranean, a mistake that led to a defeat at the Battle of Dungeness but didn&#x27;t prevent the defeat of the not yet reinforced English Mediterranean fleet at the Battle of Leghorn. In the former battle the Dutch were led again by Tromp; De With had suffered a mental breakdown and would be officially replaced as supreme commander in May 1653.

==Ship lists==
No complete lists exist and especially the order of battle of the English fleet is poorly known. The Dutch list differs in detail from particular lists of ships from late September 1652 from Witte de With&#x27;s journal and other archival sources. Known ships include:

===England (Robert Blake)===
===Dutch Republic (Witte de With)===

<text>Oyggjaframi (marx-leninistar) () or OFML was a communist organization in the Faroe Islands. The party was established in 1972 when it split from &quot;Oyggjaframi&quot;. 

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1968 the Copenhagen-based Faroese association &quot;Oyggjaframi&quot; had founded a branch in Tórshavn. Whilst the Copenhagen branch continued to function as a broad socialist discussion club, a tendency emerged within the Tórshavn branch calling for the building of a communist party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. At the Oyggjaframi congress in 1972 the organization was split, with the Copenhagen branch continuing to function as Faroese Socialists and the Tórshavn branch constituting OFML.

=== Rhetoric ===
As of 1975, Hermann Oskarsson was chairman of OFML. The 1975 congress of OFML adopted 5 slogans outlining the priorities of the organization;
*Studies as the central activity
*Consolidate and expand democratic centralism
*Strike roots in the working class
*Lead the popular movement against the EEC
*Publish a communist workers newspaper

OFML published the first issue of &quot;Arbeiðið&quot; May 1, 1976.

Initially OF(m-l) took part in the Nordic cooperation of Marxist-Leninist parties that included Arbeidernes Kommunistparti of Norway, Kommunistiska Förbundet Marxist-Leninisterna of Sweden, Kommunistisk Arbejderparti of Denmark, Marxist-Leninist Groups of Finland, and Einingarsamtök Kommúnista (marx-lenínistar) of Iceland. When the Sino-Albanian split occurred, OFML and EIK(ml) followed the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania. 

During its last years, OFML kept close contacts with the pro-Albanian Danish Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti/Marxister-Leninister.

<text>Creo, now part of Eastman Kodak Company, was a Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada-based company, involved in imaging and software technology for computer to plate and digital printing. The name derives from the Latin &quot;creo&quot;, &quot;I create.&quot;

Creo was founded in 1983 and acquired by Kodak 22 years later on January 31, 2005.

In its current incarnation, Kodak Digital Printing Solutions Group manufactures printing plates, professional digital cameras, color and copydot scanning systems; inkjet, drop-on-demand, and digital halftone proofers; workflow management software; variable information workflow systems; and computer-to-film and computer-to-plate devices..

==Creo Inc.==
Prior to acquisition by Kodak, Creo had over 4,200 employees spread over five sites in the Greater Vancouver area, with three in the Burnaby area and two facilities in Delta, BC. Creo and was initially a manufacturer of optical tape recorder (OTR) devices and a vendor of laser imaging engines to the printing industry. Some of Creo&#x27;s main products are Prinergy, Prinergy Evo and InSite, a prepress workflow and file processing system. In 2000, it acquired the worldwide graphic arts operations of Scitex, based out of Israel. A more detailed history is published by International Directory of Company Histories.
===Founders and Officers===
Creo was founded in 1983 by Dan Gelbart (who retired from Kodak in 2007, two years after acquisition) and Ken Spencer (who retired from Creo in the 1990s, prior to acquisition). Amos Michelson was the CEO from 1995 until it was sold to Kodak in 2005.

<doc id="879775" wikidata="Q5121089" url="?curid=879775" title="Cinram">
<text>Cinram International was a Toronto, Canada-based manufacturer of pre-recorded Blu-ray Discs, DVDs, CD-Audio, CD-ROMs, VHS tapes and audio cassettes. It was an affiliate of the Arizona-based Najafi Companies.

== History ==
Cinram was established in 1969 in a Montreal basement by Isidore Philosophe and Samuel Sokoloff. The company started manufacturing pre-recorded eight-track tapes and cassettes in 1969 in the basement of a commercial building in Montreal. More than three decades later, in 2003, the company completed a US$1.1 billion purchase of the music- and movie-manufacturing assets (WEA Manufacturing) of New York media giant Time Warner. Also that year, it bought the United States manufacturing operations of EMI and, later, Universal Media &amp; Logistics France from Universal Music Group.

Cinram opened its first CD plant in 1987, when records and cassettes were still dominant. In the 1990s, the company started investing in manufacturing operations in Europe, and in 1997, when video-store racks were still filled with VHS tapes, Cinram formed a joint venture with Pacific Ocean Post (POP) to form &quot;Cinram DVD Center POP&quot; and began producing DVDs for movie studios and software CDs.

=== Bankruptcy ===
The company&#x27;s fortunes began to decline with the rise of online streaming services. In 2010, Cinram lost its major contract for distributing Warner Bros. movies, and its stock began to fall. In 2012, the company sought bankruptcy protection from its creditors in the United States. It was bought by private investment firm Najafi Companies. In 2014, the company ended its manufacturing operations in Toronto. That year, it bought JVC America from JVC Kenwood. In 2015, it shut its Huntsville, Alabama manufacturing plant.

On November 3, 2015, Paris-based Technicolor SA announced that it would acquire Cinram.

In 2017, Cinram closed down its European manufacturing plant at Alsdorf in Germany and in 2018, it shut its Olyphant, Pennsylvania manufacturing plant.

<doc id="879782" wikidata="Q1107048" url="?curid=879782" title="Cognos">
<text>Cognos Incorporated was an Ottawa, Ontario-based company making business intelligence (BI) and performance management (PM) software. Founded in 1969, at its peak Cognos employed almost 3,500 people and served more than 23,000 customers in over 135 countries until being acquired by IBM on January 31, 2008. While no longer an independent company, the Cognos name continues to be applied to IBM&#x27;s line of business intelligence and performance management products.

==History==
Cognos was founded in 1969 by Alan Rushforth and Peter Glenister. Michael U. Potter joined Cognos in 1972, and was its chief executive officer from 1975 until 1995. It began as a consulting company for the Canadian federal government and offered its first software product, QUIZ, in 1979. During the Canadian recession in the 1980s, Cognos shifted its focus from consulting to software sales.

Originally Quasar Systems Limited, it adopted the Cognos name in 1982. Cognos is a fragment scissored off the Latin word &quot;cognosco,&quot; which means &quot;knowledge from personal experience&quot;. Cognos became a public company in August 1986 trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange as CSN and on the NASDAQ as COGN. Its independent existence ended on January 31, 2008, when Cognos was acquired by IBM.

In 1995, Ron Zambonini was named CEO and brought new marketing strategies. Cognos grew successful with its business intelligence products for local area networks (LAN), but new Internet technologies had come into the BI industry faster than the company had anticipated. After Cognos issued a notice informing shareholders of a slowdown in growth, many sold their shares, causing prices to fall quickly.

This prompted Cognos to build its web technology through the acquisition of other companies rather than internal research and development. In September 2007, Cognos announced that it would be acquiring Applix. It had previously acquired Right Information Systems (4Thought), Interweave (Impromptu Web Query), Relational Matters (DecisionStream), Scientific Time Sharing Corporation (LEX2000), NoticeCast, Adaytum, Frango, DataBeacon, and Celequest.

In January 2010, as part of a reorganization of IBM Software Group, software from Cognos and recently acquired SPSS were brought together to create the Business Analytics division.

On December 31, 2013, UNICOM Systems, a division of UNICOM Global acquired the PowerHouse product line including PowerHouse 4GL Server, Axiant® 4GL and PowerHouse Web®, so Powerhouse products would no longer be part of the IBM product set.

==Federal investigation==
In August 2007, the Massachusetts state Information Technology Division awarded Cognos a $13 million USD contract for performance management software. This followed a 2006 $4.5 million USD state contract awarded to Cognos by the Massachusetts Department of Education. These contracts came under scrutiny from the State Ethics Commission and the office of state Inspector General Gregory Sullivan when several conflicts of interest surrounding Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Salvatore DiMasi and his accountant Richard Vitale came to light.

In the course of these investigations, a payoff from former Cognos sales executive Joseph Lally in the amount of $600,000 USD was found to have been made to Vitale&#x27;s company WN Advisors. Vitale and WN Advisors were not registered as state lobbyists and did not disclose the payments, the bulk of which were apparently made on the same day that the state wired funds for the multimillion-dollar contracts to Cognos. The disposition of the funds has not been disclosed and the State has rescinded the contracts. IBM, who now owns Cognos, has refunded the improperly awarded $13 million USD paid to Cognos. A second close associate of DiMasi&#x27;s, lawyer Steven Topazio, was placed on a two-year $5,000 a month retainer for unspecified purposes. This retainer stopped the same month as the second Cognos contract was awarded.

In addition to the payoffs made to close associates of DiMasi, it is known that Vitale helped arrange a below-market mortgage for DiMasi, which violated state Ethics laws.

On December 17, 2008, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; confirmed that the State investigations were being joined by a Federal Grand Jury probe investigating the allegations and potential violations of Federal law. On June 2, 2009, DiMasi, Vitale, Lally, and Cognos lobbyist Richard McDonough were indicted &quot;on a battery of...corruption charges&quot; as a result of that probe.

==Acquisition of Cognos by IBM==
In 2007, following SAP&#x27;s acquisition of Business Objects and Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of Hyperion Solutions, IBM announced its acquisition of Cognos in November for $4.9 billion. It continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary (Cognos, an IBM company) until January 1, 2009, when it was absorbed into the IBM Infosphere product line under IBM Information Management Software brand within the company&#x27;s Software Group. The software is now called &quot;IBM Cognos Analytics&quot; and &quot;IBM Planning Analytics&quot; or CA and PA.

==BI market==
IBM&#x27;s purchase of Cognos and other business intelligence software vendors was a step in establishing IBM as a BI &quot;megavendor&quot; (along with Oracle, Microsoft, and SAP). This consolidation may prove beneficial for customers to have fewer vendors to deal with, but this raises concerns about integration of the software as more vendors are bought out by the big four. Another challenge is maintaining the same level of customer service. Gartner interprets the lower ratings given in &quot;customer experience&quot; for IBM Cognos and SAP Business Objects as a result of post-acquisition issues. Due to many consolidations in the BI industry, there are only a few independent &quot;pure-play&quot; vendors remaining (SAS and MicroStrategy being the largest).

==Products==
On October 26, 2015, at the IBM Insight conference in Las Vegas, IBM leadership announced a redesigned user experience for its flagship Cognos Business Intelligence software. The redesign will be version 11 and an upgrade from Cognos Business Intelligence 10.x. The differentiation in the version 11 release also required renaming to IBM Cognos Analytics, based on the same self-service design principles as Watson Analytics. The redesigned Cognos product also features smarter search that works in-context.

On October 25, 2010, at the Business Analytics Forum in Las Vegas, IBM general manager for business analytics and former Cognos CEO Rob Ashe announced IBM Cognos 10. A significant upgrade to IBM Cognos 8 BI, this new software brings together social collaboration and analytics for business users to gain real-time intelligence in a single, user-friendly interface — online or through mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone and BlackBerry devices.

IBM Cognos 8 BI, initially launched in September 2005, combined the features of several previous products, including ReportNet, PowerPlay, Metrics Manager, NoticeCast, and DecisionStream. There are also Express and Extended versions of Cognos 8 BI. Full features:
*Report Studio (Professional report authoring tool formatted for the web)
*Query Studio (Ad hoc report authoring tool with instant data preview)
*Analysis Studio (Explore multi-dimensional cube data to answer business questions)
*Metric Studio (Monitor, analyze, and report on KPIs)
*Metric Designer (Define, load, and maintain metrics to be available in Metric Studio)
*Event Studio (Action-based agents to notify decision makers as events happen)
*Framework Manager (Semantic metadata layer tool which creates models or packages)
*PowerPlay Studio (formerly PowerPlay Web)
*Analytic Applications (Packaged BI Applications, built on an adaptable platform and extensible into Business Analytics) 

IBM Cognos Express, launched in September 2009, is an integrated business intelligence and planning solution purpose-built to meet the needs of midsize companies. The features of Express are:
*Cognos Express Reporter (Self-service reporting and ad hoc query)
*Cognos Express Advisor (Freeform analysis and visualization)
*Cognos Express Xcelerator (TM1-based planning and business analysis, with Microsoft Excel and web interfaces)

IBM Cognos also offered several application development tools (which IBM later sold to UNICOM Global):
*IBM Cognos PowerHouse 4GL
*IBM Cognos PowerHouse Web
*IBM Cognos Axiant 4GL

IBM Cognos Analytics also currently offers a free trial

<doc id="879790" wikidata="Q3289316" url="?curid=879790" title="Marcel Prud'homme">
<text>Marcel Prud&#x27;homme, (November 30, 1934 – January 25, 2017) was a Canadian politician who served as a member of the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada.

==Early life==
Prud&#x27;homme was born in Montreal the youngest of Dr. Hector Prud&#x27;homme and the former Lucia Paquette&#x27;s 12 children. Dr. Prud&#x27;homme also served as a city councillor which gave the younger Prud&#x27;homme exposure to politics.

He completed a BA in social sciences, economics and politics at the University of Ottawa in 1959, then studying law at the University of Montreal.

==Political career==
Prud&#x27;homme was elected president of both the Young Liberals of Canada and president of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa in 1958. He became lifelong friends with Brian Mulroney as a result of debating him at model parliaments and student conferences. As prime minister, Mulroney would later elevate Prud&#x27;homme to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and the Senate of Canada.

He almost entered Quebec provincial politics in the 1960 provincial election being offered the Quebec Liberal Party&#x27;s nomination in Montreal-Laurier, only to be asked to step aside at the last minute for star candidate René Lévesque.

Prud&#x27;homme was first elected to the House of Commons in a 1964 by-election as Liberal MP for Saint-Denis, Quebec. He was subsequently re-elected eight times.

He served as Parliamentary Secretary from 1971 to 1974 to the Minister of Manpower and Immigration, Secretary of State for Canada, and to the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion successively.

For most of his career, however, Prud&#x27;homme was a backbencher. He was particularly outspoken in his support for Palestinian causes and in his opposition to Zionism and this may have hindered the prospects of his serving in the Canadian Cabinet. In 1989, while in Opposition, he became the Liberal Party&#x27;s Critic for Arms Control and Disarmament. In 1992, he became Chair of the Quebec Liberal Caucus. On July 1, 1992, Prud&#x27;homme was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada in honour of his longstanding personal friendship with then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

In 1993, Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed Prud&#x27;homme to the Canadian Senate where he took his seat as an independent. The Liberals saw this move as an attempt to provide a non-partisan cover to various patronage appointments Mulroney made at the end of his term as prime minister.

He resigned in 2009 at 75 as the law required.

==Death==
Prud&#x27;homme, who had suffered from heart and kidney ailments for several years, died in Ottawa, Ontario on January 25, 2017, aged 82, due to complications after a fall.

==Honours==
In 2007, he was awarded the Order of Friendship of Russia. Prud&#x27;homme was also awarded honours by Morocco, Cuba and Hungary and was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of Algiers as well as five Canadian commemorative medals.

<text>Martin Spanberg (d. 1761; , &quot;Martyn Petrovich Shpanberg&quot;) was a Danish-born Russian naval officer who took part with his compatriot Vitus Bering in both Kamchatka expeditions as second in command. He is best known for finding a sea route to Japan from Russian territory and for exploring the Kuril Islands. Shikotan, one of the Kurils, was renamed in his honor by the Russians in 1796.

Spanberg led three voyages in 1738, 1739, and 1742. On the first of these voyages, Spanberg left 29 June 1738 aboard the &quot;Archangel Michael&quot; (, &quot;Arkhangel Mikhail&quot;) with his own assistants William Walton ( or , &quot;Vilim Valton&quot;) and Alexander Shelting (, &quot;Aleksey Yeleazarovich Shel&#x27;ting&quot;) commanding the &quot;Sv.&quot; or &quot;St. Gabriel&quot; (, &quot;Sviatoi Gavriil&quot;) and the &quot;Nadezhda&quot; () respectively. He charted 30 of the Kurils. On the second voyage, he gained a fourth shipthe &quot;Bolsheretsk&quot; ()and was the first Russian commander to visit Honshu in Japan, establishing Russo-Japanese diplomatic relations. His ships landed in a scenic area now part of the Rikuchu Kaigan National Park but, despite isolationist Japanese &quot;sakoku&quot; policy of the time, the sailors were treated with courtesy. The second and third voyages also surveyed the coasts of Japan and Sakhalin as well as the Kurils. 

==Works==
Spanberg wrote a brief account of his travels. They pointedly failed to locate the phantom islands of Rica de Oro and Rica de Plata (&quot;Rich in Gold and Silver&quot;) supposedly in the area. Producing the first trustworthy account of the region, Spanberg further established that the supposedly enormous Staten Island (, lit. &quot;States Island&quot;) and Company Land (; ) common on European maps after the 1643 visit of Maarten Gerritsz Vries of the Dutch East India Company were either nonexistent or much smaller in extent, grossly misrepresenting some of the Kurils like Urup and Iturup. This was not, however, immediately accepted, and the various phantom islands continued to appear on French and other maps for decades longer.

==Honors==
Shpanberg Island in the Kurils and Shpanberg Island in the Nordenskiöld Archipelago are named for him.

<doc id="879817" wikidata="Q1463730" url="?curid=879817" title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3">
<text>Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 is a 2001 skateboarding video game and the third installment in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series. It was published by Activision under the Activision O2 label in 2001 for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Color and GameCube. In 2002, it was published for the Xbox, Game Boy Advance, Windows, Mac OS, and the Nintendo 64. It was the final official release for the Nintendo 64 (having been discontinued 3 months prior) and the only game that was released for the system in 2002, the first game released for the PlayStation 2 supporting online play and was a launch title for the GameCube in North America and PAL regions.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; received critical acclaim, with the PlayStation 2 version being tied for highest-rated PlayStation 2 game on Metacritic alongside &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, and selling over 2.1 million copies in the United States by July 2006. &quot;Pro Skater 3&quot; is also considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; saw the introduction of the revert, a trick that enabled vert combos to be tied together with a manual, by tapping a button when landing in a quarterpipe; it allows for much longer combos than in the previous two games, where landing in a quarterpipe would finish a combo. It also added hidden combos. These were variations on standard tricks that could be performed as grab, flip, lip, or grind tricks. For example, double-tapping the kickflip button would make the character perform a double kickflip. This system would later be refined in &quot;Pro Skater 4&quot;.

The game stood out in the franchise for being the first title to have online capabilities. Users could connect directly to other players online on the PlayStation 2 version—even prior to the launch of the network adapter, with a USB Ethernet adapter. Due to the shut down of most Sony servers the game is no longer playable with others online, except for via programs like XLink Kai or through websites that allow users to play online through a DNS. The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions run on the &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot; engine, with a different revert animation that is the same as the PlayStation version of &quot;Pro Skater 4&quot;.

The game features thirteen professional skateboarders, along with several unlockable original characters, depending on the version. Furthermore, the game features Darth Maul, Doomguy and Wolverine via licensing deals, as well as professional surfer Kelly Slater (to coincide with Kelly Slater&#x27;s Pro Surfer). Additionally, the Japanese and other Asian versions feature three Japanese pro skaters.

In both the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation versions, the wooden sides on the board (around the grip tape) has colors (except Bam Margera, Jamie Thomas, and the custom skater&#x27;s decks), and the game has new tricks such as the Cannonball, Wrap Around, Fingerflip, Del Mar Indy and a new animation for the Airwalk. The Xbox version has an improved frame rate over the PlayStation 2 and GameCube version, as well as an additional level, the Oil Rig.

==Development==

Shortly prior to release, Neversoft quickly amended some of the objectives in the Airport level due to sensitivity reasons in light of the September 11, 2001 attacks, where terrorist non-player characters were instead reskinned into pickpockets. Series producer Ralph D&#x27;Amato recalled: &quot;When 9/11 happened, we were almost finished with &quot;Pro Skater 3&quot;. We had an airport level where the goal was to stop terrorists bombing the plane. We had to scramble and change it to stopping pickpockets&quot;.

==Reception==
Chester Barber of &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave five stars out of five for PlayStation 2 version, highly praising the gameplay, new tricks to perform, graphics and controls.
By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; had sold 2.1 million copies and earned $77 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 14th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the country. Combined sales of &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; console games released in the 2000s reached 10.7 million units in the U.S. by July 2006. Its PlayStation 2 version also received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the British Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the country.

The PS2 version earned a rare perfect 10 score from Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot (one of only 20 titles to earn this award in GameSpot&#x27;s history), who stated that the game &quot;makes everything before it almost unplayable by comparison&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; the best PlayStation game, best alternative sports console game and overall second-best console game of 2001. It was also nominated for the publication&#x27;s annual &quot;Best GameCube Game&quot; and &quot;Best PlayStation 2 Game&quot; awards. It was also awarded the best sports game award at E3 2001.

<text>Cyril Lloyd Francis (March 19, 1920 – January 20, 2007) was a Canadian politician and speaker of the House of Commons. A member of the Liberal Party, he represented Carleton and Ottawa West in the House of Commons.

== Biography ==
Following service in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, Francis earned a Master of Arts (MA) and doctorate (Ph.D) in economics, and lectured in the discipline from 1948 to 1951 at the University at Buffalo. He then joined the Department of National Health and Welfare in Ottawa as a senior economist.

In 1956, Lloyd Francis and partner, lawyer Donald Sim, carrying on business as Lynhar Developments, acquired and laid out the Stinson Avenue area of Bells Corners in Nepean. They quickly formed a partnership with William Teron, T.F.S. Lands, to build the houses in Lynwood Village.

The Lynwood Plaza at Bells Corners was built by Francis and Sim&#x27;s Lynhar Developments and included what would become the landmark Robinson IGA.

Long time Nepean Reeve D. Aubrey Moodie, in his book, &quot;The Spirit of Nepean&quot; described Francis as one of the contributors to the foundation of Nepean. Moodie explains about the introduction of lot levies, now known as development charges, and how they contributed to the financial stability of Nepean Township. It was the transfer of large sums of money in the form of lot levies, along with Francis and Teron&#x27;s aggressive development activity that enabled much of Nepean&#x27;s Parkwood Hills and Bells Corners neighbourhoods to be built. To the pleasure of some and the disdain of others, Mr. Francis was one of a list of individuals credited with the introduction of lot levies as a development finance tool that is relied upon to this day to fund infrastructure commensurate with new residential developments.

In 1958, Francis became President of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, a union representing civil servants in certain professions. In 1959, he entered municipal politics by being elected alderman on Ottawa City Council. From 1960 to 1963, he served on the city&#x27;s Board of Control and as Deputy Mayor.

He entered federal politics as a Liberal candidate in the 1962 election but was defeated in the Ottawa-area riding of Carleton. His electoral record was mixed throughout his career and he would only win election on alternate attempts. Accordingly, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Carleton from 1963 to 1965 and then for Ottawa West in 1968–1972, 1974–1979 and 1980–1984. In his autobiography, &quot;Ottawa Boy&quot;, Francis described his anger when, in 1974, Liberal Party insiders tried to &quot;parachute&quot; in an alternate candidate, Byron Hyde, a politically inexperienced outsider, to run against him, to be the Liberal Party candidate for his riding.

He served as Chief Government Whip from 1970 to 1971 and then as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs until he was defeated in the 1972 election. After he returned to Parliament in the 1974 election, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board from 1975 to 1976.

In 1980, he became Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. He succeeded Jeanne Sauvé as Speaker on January 15, 1984, when Sauvé became Governor General of Canada.

The Liberal government was defeated in the 1984 election, and Francis lost his seat. His term as Speaker ended when the new House of Commons convened in November of that year.

On the conclusion of his term as Speaker, Francis was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. In late 1984, the new Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney, appointed Francis to the position of Ambassador to Portugal. Francis returned to Ottawa at the conclusion of his appointment in 1987.

He died in January 2007, after suffering from stomach cancer.

== The Francis Tapes ==
In 1985, prior to him leaving to Portugal as Canada&#x27;s Ambassador, Francis gave a revealing interview in recorded tapes made for the Public Archives of Canada and the Library of Parliament as part of historical archives that he claimed to have thought would be released only 15 or 25 years later. The tapes revealed alleged sexual harassment and fraud in the House of Commons.

<text>St Joseph&#x27;s Hurling Club (&quot;Cumann Iomána Naomh Iosaf&quot;) was founded in 1995, bringing Gaelic games to the people of Silicon Valley. The club&#x27;s men&#x27;s teams have won six hurling titles, two Gaelic football titles, and the women&#x27;s Gaelic football team winning their championship in 1999.

After the 2002 season, the club was disbanded. A later increase in the area&#x27;s Irish population resulted in the club being reformed in time for the 2012 hurling season. Success followed in the 2014 season with St. Joseph&#x27;s winning the Western Division Junior Championship and North American Junior B Championship. St. Joseph&#x27;s went on to retain their Western Division Junior Championship in 2015.

Although many of the players are locally settled Irish, St. Joseph&#x27;s also seeks other players from the area. Nearby Stanford University has a collegiate hurling team and has close ties with St. Joseph&#x27;s.

The club is affiliated to the Western Division Board, an affiliate of the North American GAA.

<doc id="879836" wikidata="Q2204664" url="?curid=879836" title="Battle of Leghorn">
<text>The naval Battle of Leghorn took place on 4 March 1653 (14 March Gregorian calendar),
 during the First Anglo-Dutch War, near Leghorn (Livorno), Italy. It was a victory of a Dutch squadron under Commodore Johan van Galen over an English squadron under Captain Henry Appleton. Afterwards, another English squadron under Captain Richard Badiley, which Appleton had been trying to join up with, reached the scene in time to observe the capture of the last ships of Appleton&#x27;s squadron, but was outnumbered and forced to return to Porto Longone.

==Background==
In 1652 the government of the Commonwealth of England, mistakenly believing that the United Provinces after their defeat at the Battle of the Kentish Knock would desist from bringing out fleets so late in the season, split their fleet between the Mediterranean and home waters. This division of forces led to a defeat at the Battle of Dungeness in December 1652, and by early 1653 the situation in the Mediterranean was critical too. Appleton&#x27;s squadron of six ships (including four hired merchantmen) was trapped in Leghorn by a blockading Dutch fleet of 16 ships, while Richard Badiley&#x27;s of eight (also including four hired merchantmen) was at Elba.

The only hope for the English was to combine their forces, but Appleton sailed too soon and engaged with the Dutch before Badiley could come up to help. Three of his ships were captured and two destroyed and only one (&quot;Mary&quot;), sailing faster than the Dutch ships, escaped to join Badiley. Badiley engaged the Dutch, but was heavily outnumbered and retreated.

The battle gave the Dutch command of the Mediterranean, placing the English trade with the Levant at their mercy, but Van Galen was mortally wounded, dying on 13 March.

One of the Dutch captains at the battle was son of Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, Cornelis Tromp, who was to become a famous admiral himself and one of the most celebrated and controversial figures in Dutch naval history due to his actions in the Anglo-Dutch Wars and the Scanian War.

<text>Mohammed Haydar Zammar ( &quot;Muḥammad Ḥaydar Zammār&quot;) (born 1961) is a Syrian-German militant who served as an important al-Qaida recruiter, and is currently a member of the Islamic State. He claims to have recruited many of the organizers of the September 11 attacks. He was detained in Far&#x27;Falastin.

==Early history==
Zammar was born in Syria to a religious Muslim family.
At ten he moved to Germany. He trained in metalworking and planned to work for Mercedes-Benz. Instead he worked as a translator in Saudi Arabia, and a truck-driver in Hamburg. In 1991, he flew to Afghanistan by way of Pakistan and underwent a training program for mujahideen fighters. His training included weapons knowledge, use of explosives, and advanced tactics. He was moved to an elite training camp near Jalalabad and after a year, returned to Hamburg.

Zammar travelled extensively over the next few years. While working as a mechanic, he took long trips to Syria, Jordan, Turkey, and Sweden. In 1995, he traveled to Bosnia to fight there. And in 1996, Zammar visited Afghanistan for a second time, this time to become a formal member of the group called al-Qaeda. He was reported to have been personally invited by Osama bin Laden.

== Recruiter for al-Qaida ==
When Zammar returned to Hamburg he became an Islamic preacher.
&quot;Der Spiegel&quot; described him, in 2002, as an imposing figure who frequently gave enthusiastic speeches on behalf of bin Laden and other Islamists.
German police began to investigate him at this time, long before al-Qaeda&#x27;s attacks on 9-11. Zammar made frequent short trips to Afghanistan throughout this period.

Mohamed Atta became friends with Zammar around 1998. Zammar reportedly boasted that he personally recruited Atta and other hijackers into al-Qaida. Zammar also met frequently with Mounir El Motassadeq around this time.

In 1998 Germany intensified their surveillance of Zammar. He was trailed, his phone was tapped and his calls were recorded. German authorities shared this information with the CIA, including Zammar&#x27;s phone conversations with hijackers Marwan al-Shehhi, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Said Bahaji.

Atta, Shehhi, and bin al-Shibh formed the Hamburg cell in November 1998, and Zammar is reported to have been a frequent visitor. Atta became the group leader, and Zammar was seen as a valuable conduit for international contacts.

In the Summer of 1999, U.S. intelligence discovered that Zammar was in direct contact with one of bin Laden&#x27;s senior operational coordinators. The U.S. apparently did not share this information with German intelligence. Zammar is also known to have met frequently with Said Bahaji in Germany in 2000.

==Capture==

On October 27, 2001, Zammar traveled to Morocco. Not long afterwards, he was arrested by Moroccan police with the assistance of the U.S. Although he was a German citizen and under investigation by Germany, German intelligence only learned about the arrest from the newspapers in June 2002.

Instead of being deported to the U.S. or Germany, Zammar was secretly sent to Syria for indefinite detention in the notorious Far&#x27;Falastin detention center in Damascus. Time Magazine reported: &quot;U.S. officials in Damascus submit written questions to the Syrians, who relay Zammar&#x27;s answers back. . . State Department officials like the arrangement because it insulates the U.S. government from any torture the Syrians may be applying to Zammar.&quot;

On December 15, 2005, it was officially confirmed that German &quot;Bundeskriminalamt&quot; federal police officers had on at least one occasion participated in Zammar&#x27;s interrogation in Syria; it was claimed that these officers were unaware of the conditions at the prison. This seems doubtful given that it was widespread knowledge in the intelligence/international politics community, but if referring specifically to the treatment of Zammar, it may or may not be true; it is not known whether Zammar&#x27;s interrogation by Syria or other parties did or does involve torture and if so, to which extent.

According to Amnesty International, Muhammad Haydar Zammar was a victim of the US-led renditions programme who was convicted in February 2007 after an unfair trial before the Syrian Supreme State Security Court. Amnesty also alleged that he was held in pre-trial detention for almost five years, much of it in incommunicado and solitary confinement, at the notorious Palestine Branch of Military Intelligence in Damascus. During his detention he was tortured and otherwise ill-treated. In June 2007 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that Muhammad Haydar Zammar was detained arbitrarily and called upon the Syrian authorities to &quot;remedy the situation&quot;. Amnesty International was not aware of the authorities having taken any steps to do so.

==Release==
Zammar was released as part of a prisoner exchange between the Islamist Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham and the Syrian Government in September 2013. A member of the negotiating team told Der Spiegel that days after being released, Zammar travelled to the Syrian city of Raqqa and joined the Islamic State (IS). He reportedly organised for funds to be sent to the Sinai-based militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, and negotiated for the group to swear allegiance to IS.

==Recapture==
Zammar was recaptured by members of the Kurdish People&#x27;s Protection Units in March 2018 near the village of Darnij in Deir al-Zour. , he is being held in a prison in Qamishli, Northern Syria, from where he gave an interview to the Washington Post.

<doc id="879852" wikidata="Q157077" url="?curid=879852" title="Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)">
<text>Mary of Austria (15 September 1505 – 18 October 1558), also known as Mary of Hungary, was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the wife of King Louis II, and was later governor of the Habsburg Netherlands.

The daughter of Queen Joanna and King Philip I of Castile, Mary married King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia in 1515. Their marriage was happy but short and childless. Upon her husband&#x27;s death following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Queen Mary governed Hungary as regent in the name of the new king, her brother, Ferdinand I.

Following the death of their aunt Margaret in 1530, Mary was asked by her eldest brother, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, to assume the governance of the Netherlands and guardianship over their nieces, Dorothea and Christina of Denmark. As governor of the Netherlands, Mary faced riots and a difficult relationship with the Emperor. Throughout her tenure she continuously attempted to ensure peace between the Emperor and the King of France. Although she never enjoyed governing and asked for permission to resign several times, the Queen succeeded in creating a unity between the provinces, securing for them a measure of independence from both France and the Holy Roman Empire as well as in creating of a permanent navy for Netherlands alongside Maximilian of Burgundy and Cornelis de Schepper. After her final resignation, the very frail Queen moved to Castile, where she died.

==Early life==

Born in Brussels on 15 September 1505, between ten and eleven in the morning, Archduchess Mary of Austria was the fifth child of Philip the Handsome, Duke of Burgundy, and Queen Joanna of Castile. Her birth was very difficult; the Queen&#x27;s life was in danger and it took her a month to recover. On 20 September, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her paternal grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, who had died in 1482. Her godfather was her paternal grandfather, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.

On 17 March 1506, Emperor Maximilian promised to marry her to the first son of King Vladislaus II of Hungary. At the same time, the two monarchs decided that a brother of Mary would marry Vladislaus&#x27; daughter Anne. Three months later, Vladislaus&#x27; wife, Anne of Foix-Candale, had a son, Louis Jagiellon. Queen Anne died and the royal physicians made great efforts to keep the sickly Louis alive.

After the death of Mary&#x27;s father in September 1506, her mother&#x27;s mental health began to deteriorate. Mary, along with her brother, Archduke Charles, and her sisters, Archduchesses Eleanor and Isabella, was put into the care of her paternal aunt, Archduchess Margaret, while two other siblings, Archduke Ferdinand and posthumously-born Archduchess Catherine, remained in Castile. Mary, Isabella, and Eleanor were educated together at their aunt&#x27;s court in Mechelen. Their music teacher was Henry Bredemers.

==Queen of Hungary and Bohemia==

Mary was summoned to the court of her grandfather Maximilian in 1514. On 22 July 1515, Mary and Louis were married in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna. At the same time, Louis&#x27; sister Anne was betrothed to an as yet unspecified brother of Mary, with Emperor Maximilian acting as proxy. Due to their age, it was decided that the newly married couple would not live together for a few more years. 

Anne eventually married Mary&#x27;s brother Ferdinand and came to Vienna, where the double sisters-in-law were educated together until 1516. That year, Mary&#x27;s father-in-law died, making Louis and Mary king and queen of Hungary and Bohemia. Mary moved to Innsbruck, where she was educated until 1521. Anna and Mary moved first to Vienna, and then to Innsbruck. Maximilian rarely visited, but he sent his hunter home to instruct the two girls in the art of hunting. There was emphasis on their ability to handle weapons and other physical skills. The humanist education they enjoyed focused on problem-solving skills. They were also instructed in dancing, music, and came in contact with many humanists who visited the imperial library there. Innsbruck was also home to a great weapon arsenal and a growing armament industry built by the emperor. 

This was her forming period. Similar to her grandfather Maximilian in many respects (she did not have his lively personality, but proved a better manager of financial affairs), Mary displayed a natural inquisitive mind and developed interest in the practical aspects of governing as well as military affairs. This passion would later be demonstrated during her tenure as governor of the Netherlands.

===Life with Louis===
Mary travelled to Hungary in June 1521, two and a half years after Emperor Maximilian&#x27;s death. She was anointed and crowned queen of Hungary by Simon Erdődy, Bishop of Zagreb, in Székesfehérvár on 11 December 1521. The queen&#x27;s coronation was followed by brilliant festivities. The royal marriage was blessed on 13 January 1522 in Buda. Mary&#x27;s anointment and coronation as queen of Bohemia took place on 1 June 1522.

Mary and Louis fell in love when they were reunited. At first, Queen Mary had no influence over politics of Hungary and Bohemia because of her youth. Her court was replete with Germans and Dutch, who formed a base for the interests of the House of Habsburg. By 1524 Mary negotiated significant authority and influence for herself. In 1525, she took control over one powerful political faction and neutralised another. Austria&#x27;s ambassador, Andrea de Borgo, was appointed by the Queen herself.

During her tenure as queen of Hungary, Mary attracted the interest of Martin Luther, who dedicated four psalms to her in 1526. Despite her brother Ferdinand&#x27;s strong disapproval, Luther&#x27;s teachings held great appeal for Mary during her marriage and even more for her sister Isabella and her brother-in-law King Christian II of Denmark. Mary turned away from his teachings mostly because of pressure from Ferdinand. Her trusted court preacher, Johann Henckel, is also considered responsible for Mary&#x27;s return to orthodox Catholicism. The return was lukewarm, but historian Helmut Georg Koenigsberger considers Mary&#x27;s reputation for sympathy with Lutheranism to be &quot;much-exaggerated&quot;.

Louis and Mary spent their free time riding and hunting in the open country near the palace. They tried unsuccessfully to mobilize the Hungarian nobility against the imminent Ottoman invasion. Mary tried to cooperate with her brother Ferdinand in organizing a Hungarian defence against the Ottoman Empire, while at the same time consolidating Habsburg influence. She was much more vigorous and spiritually stronger than Louis – the Hungarians realized this themselves and criticized their king – but the fact she relied on non-Hungarian advisors cost her sympathy. Alfred Kohler opines that their defence project failed because of Louis&#x27;s lack of competence.

Louis had inherited the crown of a country whose noblemen were fighting among themselves and against the peasantry. Hungary was deeply divided when, by the end of 1525, it became clear that the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent was planning to invade.

=== Ottoman invasion ===

On 29 August 1526, Suleiman and his army broke through Hungary&#x27;s southern defences. Louis and his entire government marched out with a small army of 20,000 men. The Battle of Mohács was over in less than two hours, with the entire Hungarian army virtually annihilated. Louis tried to flee the site of the battle but slipped from his frightened horse and drowned. Mary would mourn him for the rest of her life.

Hungary was divided into three parts: Ottoman Hungary – a part of the Ottoman Empire, Royal Hungary – ruled by Mary&#x27;s brother Ferdinand, and the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom – ruled by John Zápolya. Ferdinand was elected King of Bohemia. Mary took a vow to never remarry and always wore the heart-shaped medallion worn by her husband in the fatal Battle of Mohács.

== Regency in Hungary ==
The day after her husband&#x27;s death, Mary notified Ferdinand of the defeat and asked him to come to Hungary. She requested troops to support her until his arrival. Ferdinand, busy in Bohemia where he had already been elected king, instead named Mary his regent in Hungary.

Mary spent the following year working to secure the election of Ferdinand as King of Hungary. On 14 February 1527, she asked for his permission to resign as regent. Permission was denied, and Mary had to remain in the post until the summer of 1527, when Ferdinand finally came to Hungary and assumed the crown, to Mary&#x27;s relief.

Mary soon experienced financial troubles, illnesses, and loneliness. In 1528, her aunt Margaret suggested that she should marry King James V of Scotland. Mary rejected the idea because she had loved her husband and did not wish another marriage. In 1530 Charles again suggested that she should remarry; he proposed to arrange a marriage to Frederick II, Elector Palatine, who had unsuccessfully courted Mary&#x27;s sister Eleanor sixteen years before. Mary rejected him as well.

Ferdinand offered Mary the post of regent again in 1528, but she declined, saying that &quot;such affairs need a person wiser and older&quot;. Ferdinand persisted in drawing Mary into his affairs throughout 1529. Archduchess Margaret died on 1 December the next year, leaving the position of Governor of the Seventeen Provinces in the Netherlands vacant. Ferdinand informed her about their aunt&#x27;s death, saying that her affairs might now &quot;take a different course&quot;.

==Governor of the Netherlands==
On 3 January 1531, Mary&#x27;s older brother, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, requested that she assume the regency of the Netherlands. Charles was ruling a vast empire and was constantly in need of reliable family members who could govern his remote territories in his name. Mary reluctantly accepted on Charles&#x27; insistence. On 6 October 1537, in Monzón, the Emperor wrote to her:

Mary served as regent of the Netherlands so well that Charles forced her to retain the post and granted her more powers than their aunt had enjoyed. Unlike her aunt, Mary was deeply unhappy during her tenure as governor and never enjoyed her role. In May 1531, having governed for only four months, Mary told her brother Ferdinand the experience was like having a rope around her neck. While Margaret had been considered truly feminine, flexible, adaptable, humorous and charming, Mary was unyielding and authoritarian. Margaret accomplished her goals using a smile, a joke, or a word of praise, but Mary used cynical and biting comments. Unlike her aunt, Mary was unable to forgive or forget. She recognized this lack of &quot;power as a woman&quot; as her main problem.

=== Guardianship over nieces ===
Assuming the regency in the Netherlands meant assuming the guardianship of her nieces, Dorothea and Christina of Denmark, the daughters of her older sister, Queen Isabella of Denmark, who had died in 1526. Upon Isabella&#x27;s death, the princesses had been cared for by Archduchess Margaret. Charles now relied upon Mary to arrange marriages for them, especially for Dorothea, whom he wanted to place on the Danish throne.

In 1532, Francesco II Sforza, Duke of Milan, proposed a marriage with Christina, who was then 11 years old. Charles agreed to the marriage and allowed its immediate consummation. Mary determinedly opposed this decision, explaining to Charles that Christina was too young for consummation of the marriage. Charles ignored her, but she nevertheless managed to delay the marriage. She first told the Milanese envoy that her niece was ill and then took her to another part of the Netherlands for &quot;serious affairs&quot;. Christina was finally married on 28 September 1532, but Mary managed to postpone her departure until 11 March 1533.

Immediately after Christina&#x27;s departure, Mary fell ill and requested that she be allowed to resign as governor, but Charles did not allow it. A year later, Dorothea too was married. A few months after Dorothea&#x27;s departure, the now widowed Christina returned to her aunt&#x27;s court. King Henry VIII of England immediately proposed marriage to Christina, and Charles urged Mary to negotiate the marriage. She was not in favour of the union, and delayed. Henry VIII was excommunicated in 1539, at which point Charles had to end the negotiations.

=== Relationship with Charles ===
The Emperor assured Mary that he had no doubts about her loyalty to the Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, especially not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother&#x27;s laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.

Her determination sometimes caused clashes of wills with Charles. In most matters of patronage, Mary had to defer to Charles, which is why his relations in this area were not much better with Mary than with their aunt Margaret. He often criticized her decisions, which negatively affected their otherwise affectionate relationship.

=== Riots ===
Mary became worried about losing authority and was having trouble with the finances in February 1534. She complained that the budget could not be balanced even during the times of peace. Charles assured her that she was doing her best.

The Queen complained to Charles in August 1537 that the Low Countries were no longer governable and said he should come himself. In fact, Mary handled the crisis quite well and kept a cool head in public. In October, she travelled to the north of France to meet her brother-in-law, King Francis I of France, the second husband of her sister Eleanor. On October 23, they signed a treaty. Francis thereby promised Mary that he would not help those who rebelled against her, while the Queen promised to compensate certain French noblemen who lost their land in the Low Countries during the Italian Wars.

=== Military policies ===
In 1534, Mary prepared a proposal for a defensive union of all the provinces in her councils. She made the proposal at the States General in Mechelen in July, citing her brother, who had requested the provinces assist each other. The plan had to be given up and, after Mary and Eleanor&#x27;s failure to negotiate peace between the Empire and France, Mary&#x27;s letters to Charles began to resemble the theatrical outbursts of their aunt Margaret.

Mary strived for peace in the Netherlands. Charles paid no attention to the problems she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles&#x27;s loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to wage war against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary&#x27;s appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.

==== Defence of the Herring Fleet ====
During the last decade of her regency, Scottish privateers became a serious problem in the North Sea. A 1551 petition by Antwerp merchants to the Habsburg government claimed that Scottish pirates and others, over the course of eight to ten years, had taken ships and goods that were worth about 1,600,000 Holland pounds. In 1547, Mary summoned deputies from the three fishing provinces to debate the matter. Many were in favor of safe-conducts, supposedly cheaper and more effective than building up naval armaments, but the Queen refused to negotiate with a weak Scottish government. Despite a firm sentiment against money for warships, Mary acted resolutely and issued orders forbidding all herring buses or merchantmen from sailing until the three fishing provinces could formulate an acceptable plan for naval defense. Under her pressure, the provinces agreed to create a common Netherlands war fleet, but differences were only completely worked out in the very last years of her government. Cornelis de Scepper, her chief naval strategist created a plan, according to which, a large naval squadron would patrol on station off the Estuary of Maas, while swift yachts would be responsible for communication with the herring fleet. Holland consented to provide eight warships for a fleet of twenty-five sail, intended to provide security for all branches of trade in the North Sea. James D.Tracy comments that &quot;The development of this new strategy for naval defense was no small accomplishment, but most of the credit should go to the leadership provided by Mary of Hungary and her officials&quot;.

==== Creation of a permanent navy ====
Mary, the Admiral Maximilian of Burgundy and the Councillor Cornelis de Schepper were the team behind the professionalization process that characterized the Low Countries&#x27; maritime policy in the 1550–1555 period. The central government led by Mary tried to make provinces recognize the authority of the Admiralty. Mary favoured de Schepper over Maximilian but there were no distrust between the two men and the three formed an excellent team. Maximilian had too much responsibilities in various provinces, so perhaps this was why he appreciated help from others. De Schepper played the role of the mastermind, who formulated every memorandum and document regarding naval policies. From 1550 to 1555 (the year he died), he was the equal of the Admiral in equipping warships and organizing convoys. During this period, Schepper&#x27;s activities focused on Flanders while Maximilian focused on Holland and Zeeland (initially, his authority was only recognized in Zeeland and Flanders but as he also the Stadtholder of Holland, he was able to exercise this authority in this province too). Their efforts resulted in the creation of a permanent navy. Mary proved herself a pragmatic and energetic leader in the process.

=== Resignation ===

The Queen had to mediate between her brothers in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor and leave the government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand&#x27;s objections. When Mary learned of Charles&#x27;s decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles&#x27;s demands. The actual reason for Mary&#x27;s resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles&#x27;s permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.

Charles finally allowed his sister to resign. She formally announced her decision on 24 September 1555 and dismissed her household on 1 October. On 25 October, her authority was transferred to Philip, who, despite his personal dislike of his aunt, tried to convince her to resume the post. After another quarrel with Philip, Mary retired to Turnhout. She remained in the Netherlands one more year.

== Life in Castile ==
Mary wished to retire to Castile and live with her recently widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. She was afraid of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 75 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She was afraid that Eleanor&#x27;s death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she decided to move to Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.

Although she repeatedly assured her brother that she had no intention of occupying herself with the affairs of state, Mary offered to become adviser to her niece Joanna, who was serving as regent for Philip. Joanna did not wish to share power and declined her aunt&#x27;s offer.

Mary did not enjoy her retirement for long; Eleanor died in her arms in February 1558. The grief-stricken queen travelled to Charles to ask him for advice about her future. Charles told her that he wanted her to resume regency in the Netherlands, and promised a home and a large income, but Mary declined the offer. Her nephew Philip then urged her advisor to convince her to return. When Charles became ill in August, Mary accepted the offer and decided that she would become governor once again.

In September, Mary was fully prepared to depart for the Netherlands and resume her post when she was informed of Charles&#x27;s death. Distressed by the death of another sibling, the Queen, who had suffered from a heart disease most of her life, had two heart attacks in October. Both were so severe that her doctors thought that she had died. When Joanna visited her, Mary was still determined to fulfill the promise she had given to Charles and assume the regency in the Netherlands, but she was weak and feverish. She died only few weeks later, in Cigales on 18 October 1558.

In her last will, Mary left all her possessions to Charles. Since Charles had died, Philip inherited his aunt&#x27;s property. Shortly before her death, she decided that Philip and Joanna should execute her will. She requested that her heart-shaped gold medallion, once worn by her husband, be melted down and the gold distributed to the poor.

Queen Mary was first buried in the Monastery of Saint Benedict in Valladolid. Fifteen years after her death, Philip ordered that the remains be transferred to El Escorial.

== Patronage of arts ==
Mary was a keen art collector, and owned several important masterpieces of Early Netherlandish painting as well as more contemporary works. These included the &quot;Deposition of Christ&quot; by Rogier van der Weyden, now in the Museo de Prado, and the &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. Most of the collection passed to the Spanish Royal Collection after her death.

Queen Mary of Hungary was a great patron of music. She supported both sacred and secular music at her court in the Netherlands, where her &quot;maître de chapelle&quot; was Benedictus Appenzeller. Several elaborate music manuscripts that she commissioned during her governance are preserved in Spain in the monastery of Montserrat.

==Appearance and personality==
According to Koenigsberger, having inherited the Habsburg lip and not very feminine looks, Mary was not considered physically attractive. Her portraits, letters, and comments by her contemporaries do not assign her the easy Burgundian charm possessed by her grandmother, Duchess Mary of Burgundy, and her aunt Margaret. Nevertheless, she proved to be a determined and skilful politician, as well as an enthusiastic patron of literature, music, and hunting. The contemporary historian Pierre de Bourdeille though found her beautiful and charming, despite the slight tendency towards mannishness. People close to her also found her charming. What made her perceived as masculine (and usually attracted criticism as going beyond &quot;acceptable female behavior&quot;) was &quot;her authoritarian manner, her overly public life and her &#x27;masculine&#x27; activities&quot;.

<doc id="879856" wikidata="Q3077289" url="?curid=879856" title="Forges du Saint-Maurice">
<text>The Forges du Saint-Maurice &quot;(&quot;St. Maurice Ironworks&quot;)&quot; was the first successful ironworking industry in New France. At the time of the initial formation of the forges in 1730, the Saint Maurice region near Trois-Rivières had long been known for its iron resources. Although the forges went through multiple managements, they were unable to turn a profit on their own and owners had to deal with heavy debts. The French colonial state finally took direct control of the forges after the second private company went bankrupt, and managed it until the British arrival in the 1760s. In 1973 the forges were converted into a national historical site. The plant produced such staple items as pots, pans and stoves.

== Foundation of industry ==
=== First Compagnie des Forges ===
François Poulin de Francheville was the Seigneur of Saint-Maurice, involved in the fur trade, and rather successful as an entrepreneur, when he attempted to expand to heavy industry, and to develop ironworks in his seigneury. In 1729, Francheville requested a 20-year monopoly on the mining of the iron deposits in his Seigneury of Saint Maurice. The King granted this monopoly in a generous fashion, along with an exemption from indemnities or tithes. He also permitted Francheville to make use of the surrounding lands which he did not own, assuming the Seigneur would reimburse the owners for the seizure of cultivated lands.

Before starting the enterprise, Francheville also requested and received a 10,000 livre cash advance from the King with which to build the industry. As the Seigneur realized the cost such an industry could have on one man, he formed a company with three partners, while still retaining majority control of the new &quot;Compagnie des Forges du Saint-Maurice.&quot; Those partners included his brother, another merchant, the secretary of the intendant, and a member of the Conseil Supérieur, which was the sovereign council of New France. In early 1733, the company hired Christophe Janson to go to New England to study the ironworks that were in operation there.

While Francheville did construct a few roads, he tried to bypass the lack of infrastructure by conducting the smelting in the middle of winter, so that he could transport tonnes of ore from the mines to the forge over the smooth snow using sleds. The Compagnie des Forges attempted to use a method called direct ore reduction to turn ore to iron with a high yield. Unfortunately, Francheville and his ironworkers did not have the expertise to properly and consistently utilize these techniques, which were nevertheless working successfully in the British colonies to the south. In November 1733, Francheville died from an illness, leaving most of his property to his wife, including his share in the company. Practical control of the forges went in the hands of the three remaining partners and in those of the intendant Hocquart. Although Francheville’s wife took over his responsibilities in the company, the reality became more obvious as they started proper production and smelting ore. The numbers the company had promised were far beyond what could now be reasonably expected, the yield being consistently uneven and of low quality. In 1735, Hocquart sent bars of iron and a model of the forges to France so that the more experienced ironworkers of the metropole could evaluate the samples and provide advice to make the forges produce more efficiently. The same year, Cugnet, the aforementioned member of the Conseil Supérieur, was left in control of the company with a heavy debt to deal with. He thus decided to hire a French skilled worker to come and inspect the forges.

== Vézin era ==
=== Second Company ===
In September 1735, the master ironworker François Vézin arrived in New France to inspect the ironworks and the land surrounding them. He believed that a few changes would be enough to achieve significant production output and to create approximately 120 jobs, an outcome the Colonial authorities desired. For instance, the land for the forges would have to be cleared since it had not been previously cultivated. Vézin and previous investors in Francheville’s company agreed to take over the forges and all their debt, and to begin anew with Vézin’s vision, as long as they received the same monopoly terms as Francheville. The new company was officially formed in 1737. It involved Cugnet and Gamelin, who were previous investors in the forges, along with Tascherueau who was a high-ranking individual within the Marine, Vézin, and another skilled ironworker from France. As local experts claimed that Vézin overestimated the amount of energy the creek could produce for the forges, the master ironworker modified his plans and finally created a smaller forge that would not be sufficient to produce the variety of ironwork initially hoped for. Work began in earnest after the change of plans with the aid of another master ironworker sent by the intendant. Pressed by the authorities, Vézin finished the construction quickly, thereby making a low quality building. Many skilled workers from France kept arriving to assist at the Forges du Saint Maurice, but due to the rushed timeline and poor craftsmanship, certain parts of the forges were not producing any output and the skilled workers could not ply their trade. The poor construction led to sections of the forges requiring reconstruction, which raised the operating costs and limited the profits. All these setbacks continued weighing upon the production of the forges, slowing it quite dramatically, even halving it during certain periods. The constant setbacks drove the ironworks deeper into debt to the French Crown, which continuously gave loans in the thousands of livres at the request of various colonial ministers, most notably the intendant Hocquart. Vézin’s estimates of the cost of the forges were low, and production predictions were drastically higher than what could actually be produced. In 1741, the Vézin era of the Forges du Saint Maurice came to an end. The forges had been struggling financially for many years when the company finally declared bankruptcy.

== From private to public property ==
=== State rule ===
In 1741, the associates of the Compagnie des Forges announced their intention to resign. The Intendant Hocquart described two possible solutions to save the forges: either a new company would keep the private corporation running, or the State would have to take over. As everyone waited for the Crown to make a decision, Hocquart named Guillaume Estèbe director of the forges on behalf of the State. This storekeeper from Quebec was asked to make up an inventory of the enterprise and to temporarily direct it. Hocquart could not think of abandoning the forges, especially since the King had advanced a lot of money for the project. The intendant was still convinced that iron-exploitation would benefit the colony and that previous failures were entirely due to bad management and lack of money. If a new company with sufficient resources were to take over, Hocquart believed that minor repairs would be enough to ensure a great success. Despite this optimistic view, the estimated profit was not high enough to attract French investors. Furthermore, the required investment was too heavy for anyone in the colony to afford it. On May 1, 1743, the forges officially became Crown property as compensation for unrepaid loans on Vézin’s company. The former associates were thus discharged of their debt. However, some private creditors still had to be paid back and, from 1743 until 1750, the State consecrated a part of the profit of the forges to finally move on from the economic legacy of the previous owners. Even though they had taken over, official authorities still hoped to find a private company to buy the forges back. As a result, the State administered the forges on an interim basis, refusing to invest any more than the required minimum. No major change was thus implemented until 1747, when a fire destroyed the lower forge, forcing the government to pay for its reconstruction. On this occasion, a martinet was added to the infrastructure. French authorities also sent two French molders who knew how to cast artillery to Saint Maurice. This new technology and those skilled men enabled the diversification of the production. Manufactured domestic goods could now be produced and were sold on the colonial market. The forges were reoriented toward military production but never succeeded in casting good pieces of heavy artillery.

Until 1749, the forges made good profit. This success might have been the result of a cautious management; government officials did not have to worry about paying back loans to the State like previous owners did, and thus could take wiser decisions. Furthermore, more than half of the products were exported to France at high prices with the government imposing beneficial tariffs. By 1749, this prosperity reversed and the forges experienced years of deficit. Expensive repairs could not be delayed any longer and French imports increased competition on the market, causing a drop in iron prices. Furthermore, epidemics among workers spread and prevented them from working as efficiently as they did before. &quot;Labour at St. Maurice was in general dissatisfied, incompetent or insubordinate.&quot; By 1752, labor issues caused multiple interruptions in the work. As workers grew older, no young generation wanted to replace them. Men had enough work on their farm or on the fur trade to be interested by industrial employment. This shortage compelled the State to pay high wages for bad quality work to the few remaining employees. To try to manage the situation, the State hired soldiers to work in the forges. Even though the solution was not perfect, it contributed to a notable peak in the production in 1752, which became the most fructuous year of the exploitation. Despite a sharp economic decline caused by the Seven Years&#x27; War, the forges remained interesting enough for the British to take over when they gained control of the colony in 1760. Therefore, under State direction the forges made better progress but did not reach total success because of multiple disruptive wars, and because of the lack of interests from colonial labor forces as well as deceived governmental hopes of finding private associates to take over.

==British rule==
The &quot;Forges&quot; continued under British rule, as a leased concession. From 1800 to 1845, they were the concern of Matthew Bell. In 1806, controversy erupted when the firm of Monro and Bell was re-awarded the lease for 790 pounds less than the expired lease, because the Executive Council under the stewardship of Thomas Dunn had failed to set a reserve price. In 1810 the plant contributed all of the ironwork to John Molson&#x27;s &quot;Accommodation&quot; ferryboat, which was the first steamship to ply the waters of the St. Lawrence river.

The &quot;Forges&quot; had become obsolete long since when they were decommissioned in 1883.

==As historical site==
In 1973, Forges du Saint-Maurice became a National Historic Park, until that category of national park unit was retired in favour of &quot;National Historic Site&quot;. Archaeological research there continues.

<text>The Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) was an American company that operated from 1983 to 2003 led by founder and owner Victor Conte.

In 2003, journalists Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada investigated the company&#x27;s role in a drug sports scandal later referred to as the BALCO scandal. BALCO marketed tetrahydrogestrinone (&quot;the Clear&quot;), a then-undetected, performance-enhancing steroid developed by chemist Patrick Arnold. Conte, BALCO vice president James Valente, weight trainer Greg Anderson and coach Remi Korchemny had supplied a number of high-profile sports stars from the United States and Europe with &quot;the Clear&quot; and human growth hormone for several years.

== History ==
Headquartered in Burlingame, California, BALCO was founded in 1984. Officially, BALCO was a service business for blood and urine analysis and food supplements. In 1988, Victor Conte offered free blood and urine tests to a group of athletes known as the &quot;BALCO Olympians&quot;. He then was allowed to attend the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. From 1996, Conte worked with well-known American football star Bill Romanowski, who proved to be useful to establish new connections to athletes and coaches such as Korchemny. Conte and Korchemny shortly thereafter founded the &quot;ZMA Track Club&quot; for marketing purposes, well-known members of it being sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery. In 2000, Conte managed to contact American baseball star Barry Bonds via Greg Anderson, a coach working in a nearby fitness studio. Bonds then delivered contacts to other baseball professionals.

==Scandal==

In 2003, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California began investigating BALCO. U.S. sprint coach Trevor Graham had given an anonymous phone call to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in June 2003 accusing a number of athletes being involved in doping with a steroid that was not detectable at the time. He also named Victor Conte as the source of the steroid. As evidence, Graham delivered a syringe containing traces of tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), nicknamed &quot;the Clear.&quot;

Shortly after, Don Catlin, MD, the founder of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, developed a testing process for tetrahydrogestrinone. Now able to detect the new substance, he tested 550 existing samples from athletes, of which 20 proved to be positive for THG.

On September 3, 2003 agents of the Internal Revenue Service, Food and Drug Administration, San Mateo Narcotics Task Force, and United States Anti-Doping Agency conducted a search of the BALCO facilities. Alongside lists of BALCO customers in a BALCO field warehouse they found containers whose labels indicated steroids and growth hormones. In a search at Anderson&#x27;s home two days later, steroids, $60,000 in cash, names lists and dosage plans were found.

Among the athletes listed in the record of BALCO customers were:
* MLB players: Barry Bonds, Benito Santiago, Jeremy Giambi, Bobby Estalella, Armando Rios
* Athletes: Hammer thrower John McEwen, shot putters Kevin Toth and C.J. Hunter, sprinters Dwain Chambers, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery, Zhanna Block and Kelli White, middle-distance runner Regina Jacobs.
* Boxer Shane Mosley.
* Cycling: Tammy Thomas.
* NFL players: A number from the Oakland Raiders, including Bill Romanowski, Tyrone Wheatley, Barret Robbins, Chris Cooper and Dana Stubblefield.
* Judo: Conte was also connected with supplying &quot;vitamin supplements&quot; to the 1988 U.S. Olympic judo team coached by Willy Cahill of San Bruno, California.
* Swimming: Amy van Dyken
* Christos Tzekos and his athletes were initially connected to BALCO but later cleared.&lt;ref name=&#x27;IHT 10/30/2007&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Arnold, BALCO&#x27;s chemist, alleges that Bonds and Gary Sheffield were given &quot;the Clear,&quot; though the athletes deny knowing about it and Arnold does not claim to have witnessed it.

In April 2005, Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada were honored with the journalist prize of the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association. In 2006, they published the book &quot;Game of Shadows,&quot; which consists of a summary of about 200 interviews and 1,000 documents they collected for their research.

On July 15, 2005, Conte and Anderson cut plea bargains, pleaded guilty to illegal steroid distribution and money laundering and avoided an embarrassing trial. Conte spent four months in prison. Anderson was incarcerated for 13½ months. He was released on November 15, 2007, the same day Bonds was indicted by a federal grand jury on four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice.

On June 6, 2006 the house of Arizona Diamondbacks player Jason Grimsley was searched as part of the ongoing BALCO probe. Grimsley later said that federal investigators wanted him to wear a wire in order to obtain information against Barry Bonds. He told people which players used performance-enhancing drugs. The final result was that the Diamondbacks released Grimsley, and he was given a 50-game suspension by Major League Baseball.

In October 2006, investigations against Fainaru-Wada and Williams were started. The reporters were served with subpoenas to appear before a grand jury to identify the individual who leaked Bonds&#x27; name to them. They refused to do so and federal prosecutors asked that they be jailed for up to 18 months (the typical term of a grand jury). However, in February 2007, federal prosecutors dropped charges against the reporters after a Colorado attorney, Troy Ellerman, who once represented Conte and another executive of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, admitted to leaking the testimony and pleaded guilty to federal charges of unauthorized disclosure of grand jury testimony.

In an interview with &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot;, Lance Williams revealed that he would never testify in court, even if it did not involve confidential sources. &quot;I have no interest in becoming anybody&#x27;s witness.&quot;

On November 15, 2007, former San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds was indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice based on his grand jury testimony in this investigation. The trial began March 21, 2011, and he was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the obstruction of justice charge. The conviction was overturned upon appeal in April 2015.

On April 4, 2008, Tammy Thomas was convicted by a federal jury on three counts of making false statements to a federal grand jury in November 2003, and on one count of obstructing justice. She was acquitted of two perjury charges. Sentencing was set for July 18, 2008. She was sentenced to six months&#x27; house arrest and five years&#x27; probation on October 10, 2008.

On May 29, 2008, Trevor Graham was convicted by a federal jury on one count of lying to federal investigators about his relationship to an admitted steroids dealer, and the jury deadlocked on two other charges. Sentencing was set for September 5, 2008. He was sentenced to one year of house arrest on October 21, 2008.

<text>James Alexander Jerome, (March 4, 1933 – August 21, 2005) was a Canadian jurist and former politician and Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada.

==Life and career==
After receiving his law degree from Osgoode Hall in Toronto, Jerome began his law practice in Sudbury, Ontario. In 1966, he won a seat on Sudbury&#x27;s city council and, the next year, attempted to win election to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election but was defeated. He took the seat in the 1968 general election, however, and became the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Sudbury riding.

After the 1972 election, Jerome became Chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. Since there was a minority government in place, the opposition had a majority of members on the Committee and he had to remain impartial and balance the wishes of all parties in order to win approval for legislation.

His success in this role led Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to appoint him as Speaker of the House of Commons following the 1974 election.

In the 1979 election, Jerome considered following the precedent set by his predecessor, Lucien Lamoureux, by running as an independent as is the custom of the Speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. He decided to run as a Liberal, however, and was re-elected. The Progressive Conservative Party formed a minority government under Joe Clark&#x27;s leadership. Despite the change in government, they decided to keep Jerome as Speaker.

After the Clark government was defeated in a motion of no confidence in December 1979, Jerome decided not to run in the ensuing general election. In January 1980, Clark appointed him Associate Chief Justice of the Federal Court in Ottawa. He remained in this position until his retirement in 1998.

<text>Active Worlds is an online virtual world, developed by ActiveWorlds Inc., a company based in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and launched on June 28, 1995. Users assign themselves a name, log into the &quot;Active Worlds&quot; universe, and explore 3D virtual worlds and environments that others have built. &quot;Active Worlds&quot; allows users to own worlds and universes, and develop custom 3D content. The browser has web browsing capabilities, as well as voice chat, and basic instant messaging features.

== History ==
In the summer of 1994, Ron Britvich created &quot;WebWorld&quot;, the first 2.5D world where tens of thousands could chat, build and travel. &quot;WebWorld&quot; operated on the Peregrine Systems Inc. servers as an after-hours project until Britvich left the company to join Knowledge Adventure Worlds (KAW) in the fall of that year. In February 1995, KAW spun off their 3D Web division to form the company Worlds Inc. Britvich was eventually joined by several other developers, and the renamed &quot;AlphaWorld&quot; continued to develop as a skunkworks project at Worlds Inc, internally competing with a similar project known internally as Gamma and publicly as &quot;Worlds Chat&quot;. While &quot;AlphaWorld&quot; was developing a strong cult following due in large part to Britvich&#x27;s open philosophy of favoring user-built content, Worlds, Inc. favored Gamma for the company produced contract projects for Disney and others.

In June 1995, &quot;AlphaWorld&quot; was renamed &quot;Active Worlds&quot; (from Active Worlds Explorer) and officially launched as version 1.0. Around this time, Circle of Fire (CoF) was formed to create content for the &quot;Active Worlds&quot; universe. This company played a pivotal role in the future of the product. In January 1997, Worlds Inc., after failing to secure needed contracts and having spent its venture investment of over 15 million dollars, laid off almost the entire staff of the company, keeping only several employees which included the author of Gamma, now known as &quot;WorldsPlayer&quot;. &quot;Active Worlds&quot;, never considered much of an asset by the company, became an object of struggle for those close to it. Circle of Fire (COF) run by Richard Noll purchased all of the assets of &quot;Active Worlds&quot; and hired many of the &quot;Active Worlds&quot; developers. JP McCormick joined the company shortly thereafter and invested funds in COF to continue the expansion of &quot;Active Worlds&quot;.

In January 1999, COF performed a reverse merger with Vanguard Enterprises, Inc., and changed the company&#x27;s name to Activeworlds.com, Inc. and became a publicly traded company on Nasdaq under the symbol AWLD. In 2001, the company launched a new product called &quot;3D Homepages&quot;. Each citizen account was entitled to a free 30-day trial of a virtual 10,000 square-meter 3D world, using their choice of layout from a selection of pre-designed styles. After the trial, the user had the option of upgrading to a larger size and user limit. These &quot;3D Homepages&quot; were hosted for the user, unlike traditional worlds where the user would have to get their world hosted by another company or user, or themselves.

In 2002, the company increased the price of their yearly citizenships from US$19.95 to US$69.95. In June 2008, Active Worlds, Inc. released the first major update to the browser in two years, version 4.2. It included web page rendering on objects and customizable avatars. In June 2009, Active Worlds, Inc. released an open beta of version 5.0 to the public. In June 2012, version 6.0 was released. The system&#x27;s registration fee was removed in 2013.

In March 2016, the platform made headlines when YouTuber and Twitch streamer Vinny of the streaming group Vinesauce explored and came across a user by the name of &quot;Hitomi Fujiko&quot;, who he assumed to be a non-player character, but who clearly showed signs of life as the stream continued. The stream was viewed by roughly 6,000 people, and caused the platform&#x27;s login servers to crash due to an overload of registrations. As a result, no viewers were able to log in during the stream. The incident, described as creepypasta-like, led to speculation that the character was part of an ARG, and restored interest in the virtual world. It was later revealed that Fujiko was a viewer of Vinny&#x27;s streams and a former frequenter of &quot;Active Worlds&quot; who had decided to revisit the game during Vinny&#x27;s own playthrough of it as a means of entertaining herself; she later participated in a question &amp; answer session revolving around the incident on the Vinesauce subreddit under the pseudonym &quot;Pocketomi&quot;.

<text>The Rio Mondego () or Mondego River is the longest river entirely within Portuguese territory. It has its source in Serra da Estrela, the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal (i.e. excluding the Portuguese islands). It runs from the Gouveia municipality, at above sea level in Serra da Estrela, to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean next to the city of Figueira da Foz.

== Etymology ==
The river&#x27;s name is believed to be derived from the pre-Roman, Hispano-Celtic word &quot;Munda&quot; or &quot;Monda&quot; — by which names it had been referred to in the classical antiquity by Pliny and Ptolemy —, later latinised into &quot;Mondæcus&quot; until evolving into the present name.

== Geography ==
It flows through the districts of Guarda, Viseu and Coimbra, all in Central Portugal. It flows near the towns of Celorico da Beira, Fornos de Algodres, Nelas, Tábua, Carregal do Sal and Mortágua and the cities of Seia, Gouveia, Guarda, Oliveira do Hospital, Mangualde and Santa Comba Dão, before crossing the town of Penacova. The river widens by the city of Coimbra (a historical city, the largest of the region, with a university as a World Heritage Site), and the Montemor-o-Velho municipality (known for its castle and rice fields), before reaching the Atlantic Ocean at the city of Figueira da Foz.

There are two main dams along the Mondego, the Aguieira Dam and the Raiva Dam, as well as a smaller one at Coimbra&#x27;s main bridge.

=== Tributaries ===
One of its tributaries is the Rio Dão, which gives its name to the Dão wine region. Another is the Alva River, which enters the Mondego just before Penacova. The Ceira River enters the Mondego just south of Coimbra along National Road 17.

<text>Tonique Williams-Darling ( Williams; born January 17, 1976, Nassau, Bahamas) is a Bahamian sprint athlete. She won the gold medal in the 400 meters at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

==College==
She attended the University of South Carolina, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Moore School of Business in 1999.

==Professional==

Williams-Darling had a breakout year in 2004. She started with a bronze medal at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest, Hungary, running a personal best behind Russia&#x27;s Natalya Nazarova and Olesya Krasnomovets. Then in July, at the Rome meeting of the IAAF Golden League, Tonique broke Mexican world champion Ana Guevara&#x27;s 23 race winning streak in the 400 meter race.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece Williams-Darling beat Guevara again. In a head-to-head final straight, she proved to be more powerful than the Mexican runner who had been hampered with injuries and trained only on a limited basis prior to the Games. Winning the race, she became the Bahamas&#x27; first individual Olympic gold medalist.

After the Olympics she secured the win in the overall Golden League-jackpot, cashing in US $500,000 after splitting the US $1M pot with Christian Olsson.

She also won the gold medal in the 400 meters at 2005 World Championships in Athletics, in a head-to-head race with American 400-meter specialist Sanya Richards. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, despite being the favourite, she was beaten unexpectedly both in her semi-final and the final by Christine Ohuruogu of England, claiming silver instead.

Williams-Darling took the 2007 season off to nurse a hamstring injury and did not compete during the 2008 season.

In November 2012, she was elected as Public Relations Director of the Bahamas Association of Athletic Associations (BAAA) for the period 2012-2015.

In 2015 Williams-Darling served as senior director of event media services for the BTC/IAAF World Relays in the Bahamas.

==Personal life==

She graduated from St. John&#x27;s College, Bahamas. She is married to fellow Bahamian Track and Field athlete Dennis Darling and is the sister-in-law of former NFL wide receiver Devard Darling.

== Commemorations ==
In 2009 Williams-Darling was inducted into the University of South Carolina&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame.

For her achievements to date, the Bahamas Government honoured her by naming a major highway the Tonique Williams-Darling Highway.

He was born in Havana, Cuba, and has lived in the US since 1960.

===Education===
Silva holds degrees from Bob Jones University (BA, 1966), Westminster Theological Seminary (BD, 1969; ThM, 1971), and the University of Manchester (PhD, 1972). At Manchester he studied under New Testament and Biblical Studies luminaries, F. F. Bruce and James Barr. The latter&#x27;s &quot;The Semantics of Biblical Language&quot; (1961) was a strong influence on Silva&#x27;s &quot;Biblical Words and Their Meaning&quot; (1983, 2nd ed. 1994), which challenged many common linguistic fallacies in biblical interpretation.

===Academic work===
He has taught biblical studies at Westmont College (1972–1981), Westminster Theological Seminary (1981–1996), and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary (1996–2000), where he was the Mary French Rockefeller Distinguished Professor of New Testament until his retirement. A past president of the Evangelical Theological Society (1997), Silva for many years had been an ordained minister of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.

===Writings===
He served as a translator of the &quot;New American Standard Bible&quot;, the &quot;New Living Translation&quot; (&quot;Ephesians–Philemon&quot;), the &quot;English Standard Version&quot; and the &quot;Nueva Versión Internacional&quot;, and as a New Testament consultant for Eugene Peterson&#x27;s &quot;The Message&quot;. He has also authored or coauthored several books and articles, including a highly acclaimed commentary on &quot;Philippians&quot;; &quot;Invitation to the Septuagint&quot; (with Karen Jobes); &quot;God, Language, and Scripture&quot;; &quot;Has the Church Misread the Bible?&quot;; and &quot;An Introduction to Biblical Hermeneutics&quot; (with Walter Kaiser, Jr.). He is editor of the second edition of the &quot;New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology and Exegesis&quot; (NIDNTTE), formerly edited by Colin Brown. He currently resides in Litchfield, Michigan, where he continues his work as an author and editor.

<text>The Western Divisional Board of the North American Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) colloquially San Francisco GAA is the governing body of hurling, camogie, and Gaelic football in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is affiliated to the North American Board. 

Since its inception, its games have been played at various venues throughout the city of San Francisco on municipal fields rented from the city, such as Beach Chalet playing fields in Golden Gate Park, and Boxer Stadium at Balboa Park. From 2009 onward, its games were held at Páirc na nGael, a facility that was renovated and leased by the GAA on Treasure Island. 

The playing season runs from mid-April until late August. Local San Francisco championship winners advance to the NACB Playoffs that take place over Labor Day weekend every year. The playoffs rotate between cities like Chicago, Boston, Denver, Philadelphia and San Francisco. They were previously held in San Francisco in 1993, 1997, and 2001. The Continental Youth Championships returned to San Francisco in 2009 and were played at Páirc na nGael, as were the adult national finals in 2010.

==Páirc na nGael==
Páirc na nGael was opened on Sunday, December 7, 2008 by GAA President Nickey Brennan prior to the Vodafone GAA All-Star football game starring the top inter-county Gaelic footballers in Ireland. It contains three regulation sized Gaelic fields for hurling and football spanning covering the space of three city blocks. Páirc na nÓg is the name of the youth field further to the east on the island adjacent to the home grounds of the Golden Gate Rugby Club. Páirc na nGael&#x27;s development was funded by financial and labor donations from the Irish community in San Francisco, and a donation from the GAA in Ireland. A disused adjacent elementary school building was later remodeled to become a community centre and function room and funding for this was secured from the Irish Government.

<text>In computer security, mandatory access control (MAC) refers to a type of access control by which a secured environment (e.g., an operating system or a database) constrains the ability of a &quot;subject&quot; or &quot;initiator&quot; to access or modify on an &quot;object&quot; or &quot;target&quot;. In the case of operating systems, the subject is a process or thread, while objects are files, directories, TCP/UDP ports, shared memory segments, or IO devices. Subjects and objects each have a set of security attributes. Whenever a subject attempts to access an object, the operating system kernel examines these security attributes, examines the authorization rules (aka &quot;policy&quot;) in place, and decides whether to grant access. A database management system, in its access control mechanism, can also apply mandatory access control; in this case, the objects are tables, views, procedures, etc.

In mandatory access control, the security policy is centrally controlled by a policy administrator and is guaranteed (in principle) to be enforced for all users. Users cannot override the policy and, for example, grant access to files that would otherwise be restricted. By contrast, discretionary access control (DAC), which also governs the ability of subjects to access objects, allows users the ability to make policy decisions or assign security attributes.

Historically and traditionally, MAC has been closely associated with multilevel security (MLS) and specialized military systems. In this context, MAC implies a high degree of rigor to satisfy the constraints of MLS systems. More recently, however, MAC has deviated out of the MLS niche and has started to become more mainstream. The more recent MAC implementations, such as SELinux and AppArmor for Linux and Mandatory Integrity Control for Windows, allow administrators to focus on issues such as network attacks and malware without the rigor or constraints of MLS.

== History and background ==
Historically, MAC was strongly associated with multilevel security (MLS) as a means of protecting classified information of the United States. The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), the seminal work on the subject and often known as the Orange Book, provided the original definition of MAC as &quot;a means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity (as represented by a label) of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization (i.e., clearance) of subjects to access information of such sensitivity&quot;. Early implementations of MAC such as Honeywell&#x27;s SCOMP, USAF&#x27;s SACDIN, NSA&#x27;s Blacker, and Boeing&#x27;s MLS LAN focused on MLS to protect military-oriented security classification levels with robust enforcement.

The word &quot;mandatory&quot; in MAC has acquired a special meaning derived from its use with military systems. In this context, MAC implies an extremely high degree of robustness that assures that the control mechanisms can resist any type of subversion, thereby enabling them to enforce access controls that are mandated by the order of a government such as the Executive Order 12958. Enforcement is supposed to be more imperative than for commercial applications. This precludes enforcement by best-effort mechanisms. Only mechanisms that can provide absolute or near-absolute enforcement of the mandate are acceptable for MAC. This is a tall order and sometimes assumed unrealistic by those unfamiliar with high assurance strategies, and very difficult for those who are.

In some systems, users have the authority to decide whether to grant access to any other user. To allow that, all users have clearances for all data. This is not necessarily true of an MLS system. If individuals or processes exist that may be denied access to any of the data in the system environment, then the system must be trusted to enforce MAC. Since there can be various levels of data classification and user clearances, this implies a quantified scale for robustness. For example, more robustness is indicated for system environments containing classified &quot;Top Secret&quot; information and uncleared users than for one with &quot;Secret&quot; information and users cleared to at least &quot;Confidential.&quot; To promote consistency and eliminate subjectivity in degrees of robustness, an extensive scientific analysis and risk assessment of the topic produced a landmark benchmark standardization quantifying security robustness capabilities of systems and mapping them to the degrees of trust warranted for various security environments. The result was documented in CSC-STD-004-85. Two relatively independent components of robustness were defined: &quot;Assurance level&quot; and &quot;functionality&quot;. Both were specified with a degree of precision that warranted significant confidence in certifications based on these criteria.

The Common Criteria standard is based on this science and it intended to preserve the assurance level as EAL levels and the functionality specifications as Protection Profiles. Of these two essential components of objective robustness benchmarks, only EAL levels were faithfully preserved. In one case, TCSEC level C2 (not a MAC-capable category) was fairly faithfully preserved in the Common Criteria, as the Controlled Access Protection Profile (CAPP). MLS Protection Profiles (such as MLSOSPP similar to B2) is more general than B2. They are pursuant to MLS, but lack the detailed implementation requirements of their Orange Book predecessors, focusing more on objectives. This gives certifiers more subjective flexibility in deciding whether the evaluated product’s technical features adequately achieve the objective, potentially eroding consistency of evaluated products and making it easier to attain certification for less trustworthy products. For these reasons, the importance of the technical details of the Protection Profile is critical to determining the suitability of a product.

Such an architecture prevents an authenticated user or process at a specific classification or trust-level from accessing information, processes, or devices in a different level. This provides a containment mechanism of users and processes, both known and unknown. An unknown program might comprise an untrusted application where the system should monitor or control accesses to devices and files.

A few MAC implementations, such as Unisys&#x27; Blacker project, were certified robust enough to separate Top Secret from Unclassified late in the last millennium. Their underlying technology became obsolete and they were not refreshed. Today there are no current implementations certified by TCSEC to that level of robust implementation. However, some less robust products exist.

==In operating systems==

=== Microsoft ===

Starting with Windows Vista and Server 2008, Microsoft has incorporated Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) in the Windows operating system, which adds &quot;integrity levels&quot; (IL) to running processes. The goal is to restrict access of less trustworthy processes to sensitive info. MIC defines five integrity levels: Low, medium, high, system, and trusted installer. By default, processes started at medium IL. Elevated processes receive high IL. Child processes, by default, inherit their parent&#x27;s integrity, although the parent process can launch them with a lower IL. For example, Internet Explorer 7 launches its subprocesses with low IL. Windows controls access to objects based on ILs. Named objects, including files, registry keys or other processes and threads, have an entry in their ACL indicating the minimum IL of the process that can use the object. MIC enforces that a process can write to or delete an object only when its IL is equal to or higher than the object’s IL. Furthermore, to prevent access to sensitive data in memory, processes can’t open processes with a higher IL for read access.

=== Apple ===
Apple Inc. has incorporated an implementation of the TrustedBSD framework in its iOS and macOS operating systems. (The word &quot;mac&quot; in &quot;macOS&quot; is short for &quot;Macintosh&quot; and has nothing to do with the abbreviation of &quot;mandatory access control.&quot;) The command-line function codice_1 provides a limited high-level sandboxing interface.

=== Google ===
Version 5.0 and later of the Android operating system, developed by Google, use SELinux to enforce a MAC security model on top of its original UID-based DAC approach.

=== Linux family ===
Linux and many other Unix distributions have MAC for CPU (multi-ring), disk, and memory. While OS software may not manage privileges well, Linux became famous during the 1990s as being more secure and far more stable than non-Unix alternatives.

Amon Ott&#x27;s RSBAC (Rule Set Based Access Control) provides a framework for Linux kernels that allows several different security policy / decision modules. One of the models implemented is Mandatory Access Control model. A general goal of RSBAC design was to try to reach (obsolete) Orange Book (TCSEC) B1 level. The model of mandatory access control used in RSBAC is mostly the same as in Unix System V/MLS, Version 1.2.1 (developed in 1989 by the National Computer Security Center of the USA with classification B1/TCSEC). RSBAC requires a set of patches to the stock kernel, which are maintained quite well by the project owner.

Smack (Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel) is a Linux kernel security module that protects data and process interaction from malicious manipulation using a set of custom mandatory access control rules, with simplicity as its main design goal. It has been officially merged since the Linux 2.6.25 release.

TOMOYO Linux is a lightweight MAC implementation for Linux and Embedded Linux, developed by NTT Data Corporation. It has been merged in Linux Kernel mainline version 2.6.30 in June 2009. Differently from the &quot;label-based&quot; approach used by SELinux, TOMOYO Linux performs a &quot;pathname-based&quot; Mandatory Access Control, separating security domains according to process invocation history, which describes the system behavior. Policy are described in terms of pathnames. A security domain is simply defined by a process call chain, and represented by a string. There are 4 modes: disabled, &quot;learning&quot;, permissive, enforcing. Administrators can assign different modes for different domains. TOMOYO Linux introduced the &quot;learning&quot; mode, in which the accesses occurred in the kernel are automatically analyzed and stored to generate MAC policy: this mode could then be the first step of policy writing, making it easy to customize later.

SUSE Linux and Ubuntu 7.10 have added a MAC implementation called AppArmor, which utilizes the Linux Security Modules (LSM) interface of Linux 2.6. LSM provides a kernel API that allows modules of kernel code to govern ACL (DAC ACL, access-control lists). AppArmor is not capable of restricting all programs and is optionally in the Linux kernel as of version 2.6.36.

codice_2 is a patch for the Linux kernel providing a MAC implementation (precisely, it is an RBAC implementation). codice_2 is not implemented via the LSM API.

Astra Linux OS developed for Russian Army has its own mandatory access control.

=== Other OSes ===
FreeBSD supports &quot;Mandatory Access Control&quot;, implemented as part of the TrustedBSD project. It was introduced in FreeBSD 5.0. Since FreeBSD 7.2, MAC support is enabled by default. The framework is extensible; various MAC modules implement policies such as Biba and multilevel security.

Sun&#x27;s Trusted Solaris uses a mandatory and system-enforced access control mechanism (MAC), where clearances and labels are used to enforce a security policy. However note that the capability to manage labels does not imply the kernel strength to operate in multilevel security mode. Access to the labels and control mechanisms are not robustly protected from corruption in protected domain maintained by a kernel. The applications a user runs are combined with the security label at which the user works in the session. Access to information, programs and devices are only weakly controlled.

<doc id="879901" wikidata="Q2447366" url="?curid=879901" title="Gaelic games">
<text>Gaelic games () are a set of sports played worldwide, though they are particularly popular in Ireland, where they originated. They include Gaelic football, hurling, Gaelic handball and rounders. Football and hurling, the most popular of the sports, are both organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Women&#x27;s versions of hurling and football are also played: camogie, organised by the Camogie Association of Ireland, and ladies&#x27; Gaelic football, organised by the Ladies&#x27; Gaelic Football Association. While women&#x27;s versions are not organised by the GAA (with the exception of handball, where men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s handball competitions are both organised by the GAA Handball organisation), they are closely associated with it but are still separate organisations. 

Gaelic games clubs exist all over the world. They are Ireland&#x27;s most popular sports, ahead of rugby union and association football. Almost a million people (977,723) attended 45 GAA senior championships games in 2017 (up 29% in hurling and 22% in football on 2016 figures) combined with attendances at other championship and league games generating gate receipts of €34,391,635.

Gaelic games are designated within the primary school curriculum as requiring &quot;particular consideration.&quot; They were showcased at the Château de Vincennes during the 2024 Paris Olympics, the first time Gaelic football and hurling had featured at an Olympics since 1904.

==Gaelic football==
Gaelic football is played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary object is to score by driving the ball through the goals, which is known as a goal (worth 3 points), or by kicking the ball over the bar, which is known as a point (worth 1 point). The team with the highest point score at the end of the match wins. The female version of the game is known as ladies&#x27; Gaelic football and is similar to the men&#x27;s game with a few minor rule changes. Other formats with teams of 7 to 11 players are played in Europe, Middle East, Asia, Argentina and South Africa utilising smaller soccer or rugby pitches.

==Hurling==
Hurling is a stick and ball game played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary object is to score by driving the ball through the goals or putting the ball over the bar and thereby scoring a point. Three points is the equivalent of a goal. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. It is over three thousand years old, and is said to be the world&#x27;s fastest field game, combining skills from lacrosse, field hockey, and baseball in a hard-hitting, highly skilled game. The female version of the game is known as camogie and is very similar to hurling with a few minor rule changes. Other formats with teams of 7 to 11 players are played in Europe, Middle East, Asia, Argentina and South Africa utilising smaller soccer or rugby pitches.

==Gaelic handball==

Gaelic handball is a game in which two players use their hands to return a ball against a wall. The game is similar to American handball. There are four codes of handball: Softball (also known as &#x27;60x30&#x27; or &#x27;big alley&#x27; due to the playing court dimensions), 4-Wall (also known as &#x27;40x20&#x27; or &#x27;small alley&#x27;), 1-Wall and Hardball (can also be known as &#x27;60x30&#x27;; played in the same court as Softball). 1-Wall handball is the most popular international version of handball, played in over 30 countries. The sport&#x27;s governing body, GAA Handball, oversees and promotes the game in Ireland.

== Rounders ==

Rounders is a bat-and-ball game which is played in Ireland; a similar version is played in Britain. Rounders is organised by a subdivision of the GAA known as the Rounders Council of Ireland. It is similar to the American game softball.

==Other Gaelic games==
Other Gaelic games such as Gaelic athletics have nearly or completely died out. When founded the GAA organised a number of Gaelic athletics competitions but passed the responsibility to the National Athletic and Cycling Association in 1922. Tailteann Games with Gaelic athletics were held until 1932.

<doc id="879913" wikidata="Q3265581" url="?curid=879913" title="Lucien Lamoureux">
<text>Lucien Lamoureux (; August 3, 1920 – July 16, 1998) was a Canadian politician and Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 1966 to 1974. He is the second longest-serving occupant of that office.

After graduating with a law degree from Osgoode Hall in 1945, Lamoureux worked as a political aide to Lionel Chevrier, a Canadian Cabinet minister in the government of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. In 1954, he left Chevrier&#x27;s office to establish a law practice in Cornwall, Ontario.

Lamoureux was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 election as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP). In 1963, he became Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons and decided to stop attending meetings of the Liberal caucus in order to maintain impartiality. Following the 1965 election, Prime Minister Lester Pearson nominated him to the position of Speaker of the House of Commons.

Lamoureux served as speaker during two minority governments, 1965–1968 and 1972–1974, experiences that required him to maintain authority and neutrality in a situation where no party had control of the House.

In the 1968 election, he decided to follow the custom of the Speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and stand for election as an Independent. Both the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party agreed not to run candidates against him. The New Democratic Party, however, declined to withdraw their candidate. Lamoureux was re-elected and continued to serve as Speaker.

In the 1972 election, Lamoureux again ran as an Independent, this time both the Tories and the NDP ran candidates against him. Lamoureux won re-election by a margin of 5,000 votes. Without an all-party agreement to not run against sitting Speakers in general elections, however, Lamoureux&#x27;s wish for Canada to follow the British precedent was doomed, and future Speakers would not repeat his attempt to run as an Independent. As the election produced a minority government for the Liberals who had only two more seats than the Conservatives, the closeness of it was perhaps the reason why the opposition parties would choose not to follow such a precedent.
In April 1974, Lamoureux became the longest serving Speaker in the history of the Canadian House of Commons, surpassing the record set by Rodolphe Lemieux. In September 1973, Lamoureux announced that he would not run in the 1974 election, and retired from Parliament. He was appointed Canadian Ambassador to Belgium following the election. Lamoureux died in 1998.

Lamoureux served as Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders from 1974 to 1980.

In 1998, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

On October 12, 2009, Peter Milliken surpassed Lamoureux&#x27;s record to become the longest-serving occupant of the Speaker&#x27;s Chair.

<doc id="879915" wikidata="Q6637087" url="?curid=879915" title="List of rulers of the Akan state of Akuapem Guan">
<text>For the history of Ghana, here is the list of rulers of the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akuapem Guan]].

The Guan are believed to have begun to migrate from the Mossi region of modern Burkina Faso around A.D. 1000. Moving gradually through the Volta valley in a southerly direction, they created settlements along the Black Volta, throughout the Afram Plains, in the Volta Gorge, and in the Akuapem Hills before moving farther south onto the coastal plains. Some scholars postulate that the wide distribution of the Guan suggests that they were the Neolithic population of the region. Later migrations by other groups such as the Akan, Ewe, and Ga-Adangbe into Guan-settled areas would then have led to the development of Guan-speaking enclaves along the Volta and within the coastal plains. The Guan have been heavily influenced by their neighbours. The Efutu, a subgroup of the Guan, for example, continue to speak Guan dialects, but have adopted (with modifications) the Fante version of some Akan institutions and the use of some Fante words in their rituals. As far as the other Guan subgroups are concerned, the Anum-Boso speak a local Ewe dialect, whereas the Larteh and Kyerepong have customs similar to Akwapim groups.

Constituting about a quarter of the Guan, the Gonja to the north have also been influenced by other groups. The Gonja are ruled by members of a dynasty, probably Mande in origin. The area is peopled by a variety of groups, some of which do not speak Guan. The ruling dynasty, however, does speak Guan, as do substantial numbers of commoners. Although neither the rulers nor most of the commoners are Muslims, a group of Muslims accompanied the Mande invaders and have since occupied a special position as scribes and traders.

Led by their leader Gyedu Nkansa, a quarter of the Guan settled in present-day Akuapem mountains. Prior to the founding of Akuapem State, the institution of chieftaincy as we know of today was non-existent. The leadership of highland community made up mainly of Guans and the Kyerepongs consisted of priests and priestesses. Nana Offei Kwasi Agyeman of the Aduana fame, a trader from Gyakiti, and a chief in his own right, had already left Akwamu with his people to live at a village called Adenya. Surrounded by his band of Mpoti Asafo with their proverbial seven guns. He later settled at Boampong (Kaabi) the northern part of present-day Akropong. When the Akwamus&#x27; brutalities on the Guans and the Kyerepongs had gone beyond control and intolerable, the leadership had these settlers summon a meeting to chart and discuss a way out of their predicaments. Gyadu Nkansa, then the king of the Guans and in that capacity the leader of Akuapem, in his old age and at his hour of death just at the beginning of his successor Ohene Berentiri gave authority to Ofei Agyemang, chief of Gyakiti and Sediesa (Asare Diedsa), chief of the Kyerepongs to extend an invitation to the Akims for assistance to fight the Akwamus. The delegation to Akim was led by Opanyin Ayeh Kissi, an elder of Nana Offei Kwasi Agyeman. The Okyenhene and elders readily agreed to help. He therefore dispatched his warriors led by his nephew Safori to join the bandwagon of the Guans and the Kyerepongs. A thousand forces (Akuw apem) thus swooped down the hill unto the hopeless Akwamu regiment at Nsakye as they advanced. Unable to withstand the shock of this highland change, the Akwamu forces broke, scattered and fled across the Volta river to present-day Akwamufie.

This was the famous battle of Nsakye (1730) after which the Akwamu&#x27;s unspeakable acts of cruelty and depredation on the highland community came to an end. The remnants of Akwamu, the people of present-day Aburi and its envious readily submit themselves to the new power, and thus pave the way for the establishment of Akuapem State as enshrined in the famous Abotakyi Accord in 1733.

==The Abotakyi Accord (1733)==
The common enemy (the Akwamus) having been driven away, and besides the fear that they might return, came the need to institute an internal security system to face any future eventuality.
The Akim warlords thus arranged a meeting among the Guans and the Kyerepongs at Abotakyi. The purpose was to organise the territory into an order known as Twi military order. This consideration influenced the need of allocating offices and creating of new stools. Five divisions were created to rule the state under King Safori, with the later as Okuapehene.
The five divisions are: Adonten number 1, belonging to Nana Offei Kwasi Agyeman for his role as warrior during the war. Adonten number 2 went to the remnants of Akwamu for occupying the central position of the ridge.
The Gyase position went to Nana Akompi Kwatia of Amanokrom for he being the brother of Okyenhene, and also custodian of Okuapehene palace regalia and paraphernalia. 
The Nifa position was given to the five Kyerepong towns with its headquarters at Awukugua for his role of negotiating the meeting. The Benkum division was given to the Guans at Larteh. At the first traditional council meeting the Gyakiti warlord was crowned as the senior divisional chief and next commander-in-chief whenever the Okuapehene was away.
In 1934, the then Okuapehene Nana Ofori Kuma decided that the Adontenhene Number 1 title be re-designated as Krontihene, a title that did not change his position and status in the hierarchy of Akuapem, even though Nana Yaw Boafo the then Krontihene abdicated in protest over the change. The Krontihene remained as the second-in-command to the Okuapehene. He owns Akropong, as such he is the Akroponghene. The Krontihene in concert and collaboration with the Okoman elders and the Ankobeafo administers the affairs of Akropong.

==The Larteh Accord (8 May 1994)==

The Abotakyi Accord of 1773 was permanently replaced with the Larteh Accord on 8 May 1994. The new Accord, which was signed by Nana Asiedu Okoo Ababio III, Otutu Ababio IV and Nana Gyan Kwasi II, created the following autonomous Akuapem Paramountcies:
Akuapem Guan – with Paramount Chief, Osabarima Asiedu Okoo Ababio III, in Larteh.
Akuapem Okere – with Paramount Chief Nana Otutu Ababio IV, in Adukrom.
Akuapem Anafo – with Paramount Chief Otobour Nana Gyan Kwasi II, in Aburi.
Akuapem Akropong – – with Paramount Chief, Nana Addo Dankwa III, in Akropong
The Chief and Elders, who designed the Larteh Accord, wisely included the following provision in it to ensure ongoing consultation with all stakeholders in managing overall interests and affairs of all Akuapem citizens. &quot;Establishment of a Council of Akuapem Paramount Chiefs with a two-year rotating presidency&quot;.

<doc id="879916" wikidata="Q3633008" url="?curid=879916" title="Alluri Sitarama Raju">
<text>Alluri Sitarama Raju (4 July 1897 or 1898 – 7 May 1924) was an Indian revolutionary who waged an armed rebellion against the British colonial rule in India. Born in present-day Andhra Pradesh, he was involved in opposing the British in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act that effectively restricted the free movement of adivasis in their forest habitats and prevented them from practicing their traditional form of agriculture called &#x27;podu&#x27;, which threatened their very way of life. Rise in discontent towards the British colonial rule in the backdrop of the non-cooperation movement (1920–1922) led to the Rampa rebellion (1922–1924) in which Alluri Sitarama Raju played the major role as its leader. Mustering combined forces of tribals and other sympathizers to the cause, he engaged in guerilla campaigns against the British forces across the border regions of present-day Andhra Pradesh and Odisha states in India. He was given the title &quot;Manyam Veerudu&quot; () by the local people for his exploits.

Born into a Telugu family as Alluri Rama Raju, he prefixed the name &quot;Sita&quot; to his in memory of a girl whom he loved during his youth and whose untimely demise at a young age left him heartbroken. He later took up sannyasa at the age of 18 and grew to become a charismatic leader of the downtrodden tribal people in the 20th century colonial India. As the leader of the Manyam rebellion or the Rampa Rebellion of 1922, Alluri Sitarama Raju led his forces against the British colonial rulers with an aim of expelling them from the Eastern Ghats region in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. During the rebellion he led numerous raids on the imperial police stations to acquire firearms for his under-equipped forces. After each raid, he would leave a written note in the station signed by him informing the police about the details of his plunder there, including details of the weaponry he acquired daring them to stop him if they could.

Police stations in and around areas of Annavaram, Addateegala, Chintapalle, Dammanapalli, Krishna Devi Peta, Rampachodavaram, Rajavommangi, and Narsipatnam were all targeted by his forces, which resulted in significant police casualties. In response to these raids and to quell the rebellion, the British colonial authorities undertook a nearly two year long manhunt for Alluri Sitarama Raju that resulted in expenditures reaching over ₹4 million rupees. Eventually, in 1924, he was trapped at Koyyuru village in Chintapalle forests. There, he was captured, tied to a tree, and was summarily executed by a firing squad. A mausoleum with his final remains was built in the village of Krishnadevipeta in Andhra Pradesh.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Alluri Sitarama Raju was born into a Telugu family in the current state of Andhra Pradesh, India. His father, Alluri Venkata Rama Raju, was a professional photographer who settled in the town of Rajahmundry for his vocation. His mother, Surya Narayanamma, was a pious homemaker.

His date of birth is disputed with some sources reporting it as 4 July 1897 and others as 4 July 1898. Details of his place of birth also vary, an official report suggests he was born in Bhimavaram, while other sources cite it to be the village of Mogallu in West Godavari District. New reports suggest that the village of Pandrangi in Bheemunipatnam is his precise place of birth.

Venkata Rama Raju was a free spirited man with immense self respect and great love for freedom. He once chided a young Rama Raju for practicing the then prevalent custom of Indian people saluting the Europeans in acknowledgement of their superiority. Venkata Rama Raju died when his son was aged 8.

===Education and youth===
Rama Raju completed his primary education and joined High school in Kakinada where he became a friend of Madduri Annapurnaiah (1899–1954), who later grew up to be another prominent Indian revolutionary. In his teens, Rama Raju, in accordance with his reticent and meditative nature, contemplated taking Sannyasa. At the age of 15, he moved to his mother&#x27;s home town of Visakhapatnam to pursue high school and university education. There he was enrolled at Mrs. A.V.N. College for the fourth form exam, where he oftentimes visited far-flung areas in the Visakhapatnam district and made himself familiar with the struggles of the tribal people over there.

Around this time, he became a friend of a rich man and developed platonic love for his friend&#x27;s sister named, Sita, whose untimely demise at a young age left him heartbroken. To make her memory eternal, Rama Raju then prefixed her name to his and came to be popularly known as Sita Rama Raju. He eventually dropped out from schooling without completing his course. At this instance, his uncle, Rama Krishnam Raju, who was a tehsildar in Narsapur of the West Godavari district, and under whose tutelage Rama Raju grew up, brought him to Narasapur and admitted him in the local Taylor High School. He, however, eventually gave up formal education but privately mastered the literature of Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi, and English languages. Contemporary reports indicate that although he had an undistinguished education, he took a particular interest in astrology, herbal medicine, palmistry, and equestrianism, before becoming a sannyasi (religious ascetic) at the age of 18.

===Growth as leader===
Indicative of his future as a leader, Rama Raju in his high school days was often found riding his uncle horses to distant hilly places and familiarise himself with various problems that were being faced by the different tribal people who were then living under the British colonial rule. He was particularly moved by seeing the hardships of the Koyas, a people of hill tribe. Fond of pilgrimage, in 1921 he visited Gangotri and Nashik, birthplaces of the holy rivers Ganga and Godavari. During his travels in the country, he met various revolutionaries in Chittagong. On seeing the socio-economic conditions of the Indian people, particularly those of the tribals, he was severely appalled and decided to build a movement for their emancipation from the British rule. He then settled down in the Papi hills near Godavari District, an area with a high density of tribal people.

Sitarama Raju initially became a Sadhu and practiced various spiritual disciplines to gain moral stature and spiritual powers. He also became an expert healer with herbs. During this time, the efforts of Christian missionaries to gain converts by any means amongst the hill tribes particularly annoyed him as he saw conversion as a tool to perpetuate imperialism. He continued living an austere life with bare minimum needs among the tribal people. Taking only food items like fruits and honey from them, he would return much of everything that was offered to him back to the tribals with his blessings. Very soon his charismatic nature gained him a reputation among the tribals of being someone possessed with holy powers, even a messianic status--a reputation that was bolstered both by myths he created about himself and by his acceptance of ones about him that were established by others, including those concerning his invincibility.

The people of the hill-tribes were an innocent but militant people who were made to pay a lot of dues for activities like grazing cattle, collecting fruit, fuel, and trading with outsiders. They were prevented from practicing their ‘Podu’ or ‘Jungle’ cultivation and their very traditional way of life was threatened. Rama Raju after seeing their exploitation, pleaded with the officials for mercy but it was all in vain. He then felt that the only way out is through rebellion. 

Noting the grievances of the tribals and finding solutions to their problems, he then started to organise and educate them about their rights and prepared them for a fight against the oppression and tyranny of the forest and revenue officials, missionaries, and the police. Touring the forest terrains he gained an extensive knowledge of the geographical features, which later helped him in his future as a guerrilla warfare tactician. Around this time when the British authorities confiscated their ancestral properties, the Koya tribal brothers, Gam Malludora and Gam Gantamdora who were both freedom fighters joined the ranks of Rama Raju and became his lieutenants. As the oppressive practices of the British continued to become unbearable and rebellion became the last option for people to live free, Rama Raju became their natural leader. The Government then did try to win him over by offering 60 acres of fertile land for his ashram, but he rejected it and stood by the people.

==Rampa rebellion (1922–1924)==

===Origins===
After the passing of the 1882 Madras Forest Act in an attempt to exploit the economic value of wooded areas, its restrictions on the free movement of tribal people in the forests prevented them from engaging in their traditional podu agricultural system, a form of subsistence economy, which involved the system of shifting cultivation. The changes meant that they will face starvation, and their main means of avoiding it was to engage in the demeaning, arduous, foreign and exploitative coolie system being used by the government and its contractors for such things as road construction.

Around the same time of the Act, the British Raj authorities had also emasculated the traditional hereditary role of the muttadars, who until then had been the de facto rulers in the hills as tax collectors for the plains-living rajas. These people were now reduced to the role of mere civil servants, with no overarching powers, no ability to levy taxes at will, and no right to inherit their position. Thus, the cultivators and the tax collectors, who once would have been in opposition to each other, were instead now broadly aligned in their disaffection with the colonial power.

Rama Raju harnessed this discontent of the tribal people to support his anti-colonial zeal while also accommodating the grievances of those muttadars who were sympathetic to his cause rather than those who were selfish in the pursuit of a revived status for themselves. This meant that most of his followers were from the tribal communities, but also included some significant people from the muttadar class who at one time had exploited them, although many muttadars remained ambivalent about fighting for what Raju perceived to be the greater good.

To attract people&#x27;s support, Rama Raju adopted aspects from the Non-cooperation movement such as promoting temperance, Khaddar, anti-liquor campaign, and the boycott of colonial courts in favour of panchayat courts. Though the movement died out in early 1922, it had by then reached the plains area as he was involved in propagation of some of its methods among the hill people to raise their political awareness and desire for change. These actions caused him to be put under the surveillance of police from around February of that year; despite this move, the fact that he was using his propaganda as a camouflage to foment armed uprising seems to have not been noticed by either the movement, or the political leadership of the British. 

Although he was seen praising Gandhi on some occasions, Rama Raju actively encouraged the Adivasis to equip themselves with weapons and be versed with the methods of guerrilla warfare. During the course of a conversation with the Deputy Tehsildar, Malkanagiri, Rama Raju reportedly after praising Gandhi said violence is necessary and that he will continue his campaign till swaraj is established. 

===Actions===
With his supporters, Rama Raju built strong and powerful troops of fighters. With the help of Rallapalli Kasannla, a non-cooperator and a Khadi producer from Tuni, Rama Raju, who had been reported to be a regular Khadi wearer provided only Khadi uniforms to all his troops. Sporting traditional weaponry like bow-and-arrow and spears, employing tactics like using whistles and beating drums to exchange messages amongst themselves, the revolutionaries managed to achieve spectacular success initially in their fight against the British. Realising that traditional weaponry would not be of much use against the British, who were all well equipped with modern firearms, Raju thought the best way forward is to take them away from the enemy and started launching attacks on their police stations.

Between 22 and 24 August 1922, Rama Raju led a troop of 500 people in the raid and plunder of police stations at Chintapalli, Krishnadevipeta and Rajavomangi. He gained possession of various weaponry from the seize, including 26 muskets, 2,500 rounds of ammunition, six .303 Lee Enfield Rifles and one revolver. He subsequently toured the area getting more recruits and killing a police officer who was part of a force sent to find him. A hallmark of these raids had been that after each attack, Rama Raju would sign a written note in the station&#x27;s diary, giving details of the plunder there, complete with the weaponry he acquired, date and time of his attack, and dare the police to stop him if they can.

Rama Raju was reported to had instructed his followers to not attack any Indian combatant but only the foreign enemy. The instructions were so carefully followed that when a combined force of Indians and Europeans moved through serpentine mountain paths, his followers had let go the Indians but attacked only the foreign troops. 

The British struggled in their pursuit of Raju, partly because of the unfamiliar terrain, and also because the local people in the sparsely populated areas were unwilling to help them but instead were outrightly keen to assist Raju, including providing shelter and intelligence. While based in the hills, contemporary official reports suggested that the core group of rebels dwindled to between 80 and 100, but this figure rose dramatically whenever they moved to take action against the British because of the involvement of people from the villages.

More deaths occurred on 23 September when Alluri ambushed a police party from a high position as they went through the Dammanapalli Ghat killing two officers, and thus cementing his reputation among the disaffected people. There were two additional successful attacks against the police during September. At this point after the British realised that Rama Raju&#x27;s style of guerilla warfare would have to be matched with a similar response, and drafted in members from the Malabar Special Police who were trained for such purposes. 

Attempts to persuade local people to inform about or withdraw their support for Rama Raju through both incentives and reprisals did not succeed. Later, raids were carried out on the police stations at Annavaram, Addateegala, Narsipatnam and Rampachodavaram.

At Dharakonda, once when Raju was engaged in the worship of Goddess Kali, a team of special police launched an attack on him but failed in their objective. This incident raised Raju&#x27;s profile among the tribals who then started to see him as someone endowed with divine powers.

During his raids, Rama Raju was ably supported by his trusted assistant named Aggi Raju, whose exploits were considered heroic. As the rebellion continued unabated, detachments of the Assam Rifles regiment were eventually brought in to quell it. To end the rebellion and to capture Alluri Sitarama Raju, the then district collectors: Bracken of East Godavari and R.T. Rutherford of Visakhapatnam, who had jurisdiction powers over the areas of rebellion employed all means possible, both fair and foul, from burning villages to destroying crops, killing cattle and violating women, all to no avail.

The agency commissioner, J. R. Higgins announced a monetary reward of Rs 10,000 for the head of Rama Raju, and Rs 1,000 each for his lieutenants Ghantam Dora and Mallam Dora. The fight continued for about two years capturing attention of the common people as well as the powerful officials across the country. In April 1924, to quell the ‘Manyam’ uprising, the British Government then deputed T. G. Rutherford, who resorted to employing extreme methods of violence and torture on people to know the whereabouts of Raju and his close followers.

As Rama Raju was mostly garnering support from the plains areas, the British cordoned off the hills and limited his influence between the regions of Peddavalasa, Gudem, and Darakonda. In spite of this, he tried to court more people to his side, particularly the Congressmen from the plains, but to his disappointment he found they had no sympathy for him and were against his actions on the ground that he violated the Gandhian principle of Non-violence. Historian David Arnold however noted that the real reason why the Congress leadership did not support Rama Raju and the tribals was because the Congress leaders &quot;themselves shared the same class interest of the zamindars and moneylenders&quot; against whom Raju and his people were revolting. Reactions from other political entities was either unresponsive or negative. 

==Death and legacy==
After putting up a massive effort for nearly two years, the British eventually captured Rama Raju in the forests of Chintapalle, he was then tied to a tree and faced summary execution by shooting on 7 May 1924 in the village of Koyyuru. A mausoleum with his final remains lies in the village of Krishnadevipeta, near Visakhapatnam.

Raju&#x27;s lieutenant, Ghantam Dora, was killed on 6 June 1924, and his brother Mallam Dora was caught and imprisoned, who later after Indian independence became an elected member of the Lok Sabha in 1952 from Visakhapatnam constituency. 

The efforts of Raju in waging an armed conflict without state powers against one of the most powerful empires was duly recognised. The British government grudgingly acknowledged him as a powerful tactician of the guerrilla warfare that lasted for nearly two years during which they had to spend over ₹4 million to defeat him. 

In 1929, during a tour of the Andhra region Mahatma Gandhi was presented a portrait of Rama Raju, responding to which at a later date, he wrote: 

&quot;Though I have no sympathy with and cannot admire armed rebellion, I cannot withhold my homage from a youth so brave, so sacrificing, so simple and so noble in character as young Shri Rama Raju . . . Raju was (if he is really dead) not a &quot;fituri&quot; but a great hero. Would that the youth of the country cultivated Shri Rama Raju’s daring, courage, devotion and resourcefulness and dedicated them for the attainment of swaraj through strictly non-violent means. To me it is daily growing clearer that if the teeming millions whom we the articulate middle classes have hitherto suppressed for our selfish purpose are to be raised and roused, there is no other way save through non-violence and truth. A nation numbering millions needs no other means.&quot; — Mahatma Gandhi

Jawaharlal Nehru commented that, &quot;Raju was one of those few heroes that could be counted on fingers.&quot; Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose noted that Alluri was fierce in his determination, and his unparalleled courage and sacrifice for people will ensure him a place in history.

Historian David Arnold in his book &quot;The Rebellious Hillmen: The Gudem-Rampa rising 1839–1924&quot;, noted that because of his name, the tribals used to evoke the image of the Hindu deity &quot;Rama&quot; in Rama Raju, an honorary which despite being a religious man he never asked for.

The Independent Indian government released a postal stamp in his honour at the village of Mogallu, which is generally considered to be his birthplace. The Government of Andhra Pradesh, besides building memorials at places associated with his life, granted a political pension to his surviving brother. In 2022, the Government of Andhra Pradesh carved out a new district named after Alluri Sitarama Raju from the erstwhile Visakhapatnam district with Paderu as its headquarters. In 2024, an upcoming Greenfield Airport in Bhogapuram was named after him.

<text>Raffles Singapore is a historic luxury hotel at 1 Beach Road, in Singapore. It was established by Armenian hoteliers, the Sarkies Brothers, in 1887. The hotel was named after British statesman Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore.

It is the flagship property of Raffles Hotels &amp; Resorts, and is managed by AccorHotels after Accor acquired FRHI Hotels &amp; Resorts. The hotel is owned by Qatar-based, government-owned Katara Hospitality.

==History==
Raffles Hotel Singapore started as a privately owned beach house built in the early 1830s. It first became Emerson&#x27;s Hotel when Dr. Charles Emerson leased the building in 1878. Upon his death in 1883, the hotel closed, and the Raffles Institution stepped in to use the building as a boarding house until Dr. Emerson&#x27;s lease expired in September 1887.

Almost immediately after the first lease expired, the Sarkies Brothers leased the property from Syed Mohamed Alsagoff, its owner, with the intention of turning it into a high-end hotel. A few months later, on 1 December 1887, the ten-room Raffles Hotel opened. Its proximity to the beach and its reputation for high standards in services and accommodations made the hotel popular with wealthy clientele.

Within the hotel&#x27;s first decade, three new buildings were added on to the original beach house. First, a pair of two-story wings were completed in 1890, each containing 22 guest suites. Soon afterward, the Sarkies Brothers leased a neighboring building at No. 3 Beach Road, renovated it, and in 1894, the Palm Court Wing was completed. The new additions brought the hotel&#x27;s total guest rooms to 75.

A few years later, a new main building was constructed on the site of the original beach house. Designed by architect Regent Alfred John Bidwell of Swan and Maclaren, it was completed in 1899. The new main building offered numerous state-of-the-art (for the time) features, including powered ceiling fans and electric lights. In fact, the Raffles Hotel was the first hotel in the region to have electric lights.
The hotel continued to expand over the years with the addition of wings, a veranda, a ballroom, a bar and billiards room, as well as other buildings and rooms.

In 1902, a tiger that had escaped from a nearby circus was shot in a storage place under the Bar &amp; Billiards room, which was originally constructed at an elevation.

The Great Depression spelled trouble for Raffles Hotel and, in 1931, the Sarkies Brothers declared bankruptcy. In 1933, the financial troubles were resolved, and a public company called Raffles Hotel Ltd. was established, taking over from the Sarkies.
Upon the start of the Japanese occupation of Singapore on 15 February 1942, it is said that the Japanese soldiers encountered the guests in Raffles Hotel dancing one final waltz. Meanwhile, staff buried the hotel silver—including the silver beef trolley—in the Palm Court.

During World War II, Raffles Hotel was renamed , incorporating Syonan (&quot;Light of the South&quot;), the Japanese name for occupied Singapore, and &quot;ryokan&quot;, the name for a traditional Japanese inn. The hotel was reclaimed in 1945 during Operation Tiderace by the British Navy. Stanley Redington raised the British Naval Jack on top of the Raffles Hotel.

In 1987, a century after it first opened, Austrian writer and researcher Andreas Augustin discovered the long lost original drawings of Raffles Hotel, hidden in a Singaporean archive. That year these drawings were published for the first time in the book &quot;The Raffles Treasury&quot;. Raffles Hotel was declared a National Monument by the Singapore government in 1987.

In 1989, the hotel closed to undergo an extensive renovation that lasted two years and cost $160 million. The hotel reopened on 16 September 1991. While the hotel was restored to the grand style of its 1915 heyday, significant changes were made. All guest rooms were converted to suites. In addition, Long Bar, which was a favorite spot of celebrities such as Somerset Maugham, was relocated from the lobby to a new adjoining shopping arcade. The Long Bar is notable for patrons&#x27; unusual practice of throwing peanut casings onto the floor. Long Bar is also where the national cocktail, the Singapore Sling, was invented by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon.

On 18 July 2005, it was announced that Colony Capital LLC would purchase Raffles Holdings including the entire chain of Raffles Hotels, which included the Raffles Hotel, for $1.45 billion.

In April 2010, it was reported that a Qatari sovereign wealth fund bought Raffles Hotel for $275 million. In addition to taking over the Raffles Hotel, the Qatar Investment Authority would inject $467 million into Fairmont Raffles Hotels International in exchange for a 40% stake in the luxury hotel chain.

At one time, Raffles Hotel maintained a hotel museum. It displayed memorabilia such as photographs, silver and china items, postcards and menus, as well as old and rare editions of the works of the famous writers who had stayed there. The museum also displayed photographs of its famous guests and visitors. The Raffles Hotel Museum closed in 2012. In December 2015, the Fairmont/Raffles brands were purchased by the French multinational hotel group AccorHotels.

A major renovation of the hotel was undertaken starting January 2017, and the hotel closed in December 2017 to allow renovation work to proceed. The rooms were refurbished and soundproofed, and the number of suites increased from 103 to 115. New technologies were incorporated and a new marble floor was installed. Its various food and beverage outlets were revamped, and the Writer&#x27;s Bar formerly in a corner of the lobby given its own space. Its former Jubilee Theatre was transformed into a ballroom. The hotel reopened on 1 August 2019.

Raffles Hotel has a shopping arcade with 40 speciality boutiques. The arcade also houses most of the hotel&#x27;s restaurants.

<text>The American Theological Library Association (Atla) is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3), professional association, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Atla&#x27;s member libraries and librarians provide resources for scholarly research to tens of thousands of students, faculty, staff, and administrators. The association supports the membership with services and products, including an annual conference, members-only publications and discounts, and professional development opportunities.

==Mission==
The mission of Atla is to foster the study of theology and religion by enhancing the development of theological and religious studies libraries and librarianship. Established in 1946, Atla is governed by an elected board of directors and has over 800 individual, institutional, and affiliate members.

==History==
The first step toward the creation of Atla came at the 1946 biennial meeting of the American Association of Theological Schools when presidents and deans in attendance asked the AATS executive committee to call a conference of theological librarians. In June 1947, fifty theological librarians, one president, and one dean met in Louisville, Kentucky, to organize a permanent association and plan the future agenda of the American Theological Library Association. The group identified six major areas to address and assigned responsibilities for them: 1. AATS Booklist, 2. Cataloging and Classification, 3. Periodical Exchange, 4. Periodical Indexing, 5. Publications, and 6. Training of Personnel.

Programs developed rapidly in the new Association, including the following milestones:
*1952: The Committee on Religious Periodical Indexing coordinated the efforts of twenty libraries to create the first volume of the Index to Religious Periodical Literature (later Religion Index One: RIO).
*1957: A Board of Index was established and a Board of Microtext was organized to pursue the preservation of library materials.
*1961-1966: The Atla Library Development Program, funded by the Sealantic Fund, provided more than $1,300,000 in book and professional development funds to nearly ninety participating institutions.
*1976: The first volume of Religion Index Two: Multi-Author Works (RIT) was published, later supplemented by a Festschriften (1960–1969) volume prepared by Elmer and Betty O&#x27;Brien and RIT: Multi-Author Works, 1970–1975.
*1980–1984: the Lilly Foundation funded Project 2000, a study to reassess the role of libraries in theological education.
*1981: The &quot;Atla Religion Database&quot; first became available online, providing an electronic version of the print indexes.
*1985: the ATLA&#x27;s Monograph Preservation Program started to film and preserve more than 3,200 journals and 30.000 core titles concerning theology and religion practice of the 19th and 20th centuries. the Atla Historical Monographs Collection has reached 11 series, ranging from the 13th century to 1922, with the majority of documents originating in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The first two series provide access to more than 5 million pages.
*1986: Book reviews were removed from the print RIO and expanded into a new product, the Index to Book Reviews in Religion (IBRR); RIO, RIT and IBRR were also available via the &quot;Religion Database&quot;.

More recent activities of Atla include:
*2008: Established online open access journal, &quot;Theological Librarianship&quot;
*2011: Acquired &quot;Catholic Periodical and Literature Index&quot; (&quot;CPLI&quot;) from the Catholic Library Association 
*2015: The Atla Board of Directors established a new Strategic Plan. The revised Core Purpose was adopted on February 21, 2015: To promote worldwide scholarly communication in religion and theology by advancing the work of libraries and related information providers.
*2017: Atla launched beta released of the Atla Digital Library, which is designed to provide members and other organizations with a standards compliant, sustainable, and inter-operable hub.
*2019: The association adopted a new brand with a dedication to becoming committed to being &quot;Collectors &amp; Connectors in Religion &amp; Theology&quot;. In addition, they assumed the name Atla. They were previously known as ATLA. This was done in an effort &quot;to honor what Atla has been while setting the stage for all Atla has yet to become&quot;.

==Publications==
The Atla Publishing Program serves professionals engaged in librarianship and scholarly communication, students, scholars, and religious professionals in the disciplines of religion and theology by publishing original content (books, journals, newsletters, yearbooks, reports, white papers). Many of these publications include Open Access.
* &quot;Atla Newsletter&quot; (monthly)
* &quot;Summary of Proceedings&quot; (annual)
* &quot;Theology Cataloging Bulletin&quot; (quarterly)
* &quot;Theological Librarianship&quot; (online open-access journal)
* Atla Open Press

== Products ==
Atla offers electronic resources to support the scholarly study of religion and theology, including the &quot;Atla Religion Database&quot; (&quot;Atla RDB&quot;), &quot;AtlaSerials &quot;(&quot;Atlas&quot;), and &quot;AtlaSerials PLUS&quot; (&quot;Atlas PLUS&quot;).

Atla also oversees historical archives initiatives and works with several publishing partners to offer electronic versions of specialized bibliographic and reference products.

Atla provides products for students, scholars, researchers, faculty, and religious leaders conducting research.

<doc id="879935" wikidata="Q1847901" url="?curid=879935" title="Locking differential">
<text>A locking differential is a mechanical component, commonly used in vehicles, designed to overcome the chief limitation of a standard open differential by essentially &quot;locking&quot; both wheels on an axle together as if on a common shaft. This forces both wheels to turn in unison, regardless of the traction (or lack thereof) available to either wheel individually.

When the differential is unlocked (open differential), it allows each wheel to rotate at different speeds (such as when negotiating a turn), thus avoiding tire scuffing. An open (or unlocked) differential always provides the same torque (rotational force) to each of the two wheels on that axle. Therefore, although the wheels can rotate at different speeds, they apply the same rotational force, even if one is entirely stationary, and the other spinning (equal torque; unequal rotational speed).

By contrast, a locked differential forces both left and right wheels on the same axle to rotate at the same speed under nearly all circumstances, regardless of the tractional differences at either wheel. Therefore, each wheel can apply as much rotational force as the traction under it will allow, and the torques on each side-shaft will be unequal. (Unequal torque, equal rotational speeds). Exceptions apply to automatic lockers, discussed below.

A locked differential can provide a significant traction advantage over an open differential, but only when the traction under each wheel differs significantly.

All of the above applies to central differentials as well as to those in each axle: full-time four-wheel-drive vehicles have three differentials, one in each axle, and a central one (called a &quot;transfer case&quot;) between the front and rear axles.

==Applications==
* Some utility vehicles such as tow trucks, forklifts, tractors, and heavy equipment use locking differentials to maintain traction, especially when driving on soft, muddy, or uneven surfaces. Lockers are common in agricultural equipment and military trucks. On some farm tractors, there is a pedal that can be stepped on with the operator&#x27;s heel to lock the differential as needed.
* Differential locking can also be used in the sport of drifting as an alternative to a limited-slip differential.
* Four-wheel drive vehicles that drive off-road often use a locking differential to keep from getting stuck when driving on loose, muddy, or rocky terrain. Locking differentials are considered essential equipment for serious off-road driving. Many such vehicles have a locking differential on the central differential (between the front and rear axles), rear differential and front differential, or any combination of any of the three. Differential locks are also used on some &quot;non-utility&quot; four-wheel-drive vehicles (such as the Mitsubishi Shogun) to compensate for a relative lack of axle articulation (vertical wheel movement). High amounts of articulation are desirable for off-road driving, to allow the wheels to maintain ground contact over uneven surfaces, but this can lead to excessive body-roll at high speeds on the road, as well as vague steering. Such 4x4s often have suspension systems designed as a compromise between articulation and handling. If articulation is limited, one wheel on an axle may be lifted off the ground by rough terrain, thus losing all traction to all wheels (all power goes to the lifted wheel, which spins freely). A rear locking differential is often supplied to make up for this compromiseif a wheel is lifted off the ground, the locking differential can be activated, driving the wheel that remains on the ground.

==Types==

===Automatic lockers===
Automatic lockers lock and unlock automatically with no direct input from the driver. Some automatic locking differential designs ensure that engine power is always transmitted to both wheels, regardless of traction conditions, and will &quot;unlock&quot; only when one wheel is required to spin faster than the other during cornering. These would be more correctly termed automatic unlocking differentials, because their at-rest position is locked. They will never allow either wheel to spin slower than the differential carrier or axle as a whole, but will permit a wheel to be over-driven faster than the carrier speed. The most common example of this type would be the Detroit Locker, made by Eaton Corporation, also known as the Detroit No-Spin, which replaces the entire differential carrier assembly. Others, sometimes referred to as lunchbox lockers, use the stock differential carrier and replace only the internal spider gears and shafts with interlocking plates. Both types of automatic lockers will allow for a degree of differential wheel speed while turning corners in conditions of equal traction, but will otherwise lock both axle shafts together when traction conditions demand it.
* Pros: Automatic action, no stopping for engagement or disengagement is necessary when road conditions change.
* Cons: Increased tire wear and noticeable impact on driving behaviour. During cornering, which half-axle is uncoupled is dependent on torque direction applied by the driveline. When the torque direction is reversed, the speed of the driveline is suddenly forced to change from the inner to the outer axle, accompanied by tire chirping and a strong jerk. During cornering, the automatic locker is characterized by heavy understeer which transitions instantly to power oversteer when traction is exceeded.

Some other automatic lockers operate as an open differential until wheel slip is encountered and then they lock up. These types generally use an internal governor to monitor vehicle speed and wheel slip. An example of this is the Eaton automatic locking differential (ALD), or Eaton automatic differential lock (ADL), developed by the Eaton Corporation and introduced in 1973 for GM&#x27;s Rounded-Line C/K Series pickups and utilities. The Eaton ADL is sometimes incorrectly called the Gov-Lok, despite neither GM nor Eaton ever calling it by that name. Gov-Lok is rather an unofficial name of unknown origin that gained popularity over the years. Both Eaton and GM do not know where the name came from, and Eaton has made several unsuccessful attempts in the past to debunk the Gov-Lok name. An updated version of the old Eaton ADL design is still available from Eaton, now known as the Eaton mLocker mechanical differential lock.

Some other automatic lockers operate as an open differential until high torque is applied, at which point they lock up. This style generally uses internal gears systems with very high friction. An example of this is the ZF sliding pins and cams type available for use in early Volkswagens.

===Selectable lockers MRT===
Selectable lockers allow the driver to lock and unlock the differential at will from the driver&#x27;s seat. This can be accomplished in many ways. 
* Compressed air (pneumatics). 
* Vacuum
* Cable-operated mechanism as is employed on the &quot;Ox Locker&quot;.
* Electronic solenoids and (electromagnetics) like Eaton&#x27;s &quot;ELocker&quot;. However, OEMs are beginning to offer electronic lockers as well. Nissan Corporation&#x27;s electric locker can be found as optional equipment on the Frontier (Navara), Xterra, and Titan. Ford offers an electronic rear locker on the F-series and Ranger trucks, as well as the fullsize Bronco. Toyota currently offers a rear e-locker on the Tacoma, 4Runner, and Tundra (2022+) (TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro trims only), but has also offered front and rear e-lockers on vehicles such as the Land Cruiser in the past.
** Pros: Allows the differential to perform as an &quot;open&quot; differential for improved drivability and maneuverability, and provides full locking capability when it is desirable or needed.
** Cons: Mechanically complex with more parts to fail. Some lockers require the vehicle to stop for engagement. Needs human interaction and forward-thinking regarding upcoming terrain. Unskilled drivers often put massive stress on driveline components when leaving the differential in locked operation on terrain not requiring a locker.

===Spool===
A spool or full spool (in contrast to mini-spool) is a device that connects the two axles directly to the ring gear. There is no differentiation side to side, so a vehicle equipped with a spool will bark tires in turns and may become unmanageable in wet or snowy weather. Spools are usually reserved for competition vehicles not driven on the street.

Mini-spool uses the stock carrier and replaces only the internal components of the differential, similar in installation to the lunchbox locker. A full spool replaces the entire carrier assembly with a single machined piece. A full spool is perhaps the strongest means of locking an axle, but has no ability to differentiate wheel speeds whatsoever, putting high stress on all affected driveline components.

The internal spider gears of an open differential can also be welded together to make a locked axle; this method is not recommended as the welding process seriously compromises the metallurgical composition of the welded components, and can lead to failure of the unit under stress.

====Welded differential====
Regular &quot;open differential&quot; with internal gears welded together to form a locked differential or spool. Common for drifting or offroading where locking differentials are too expensive or unreliable.

==Disadvantages==
Because they do not operate as smoothly as standard differentials, automatic locking differentials are often responsible for increased tire wear. Some older automatic locking differentials are known for making a clicking or banging noise when locking and unlocking as the vehicle negotiates turns. This is annoying to many drivers. Automatic locking differentials also affect the ability of a vehicle to steer, particularly if a locker is located in the front axle. Aside from tire scuffing while turning any degree on high friction (low slip) surfaces, locked axles cause understeer and, if used on the front axle, will increase steering forces required to turn the vehicle. Furthermore, automatically locking differentials can cause a loss of control on ice where an open differential would allow one wheel to spin and the other to hold, while not transferring power. An example of this would be a vehicle parked sideways on a slippery grade. When both wheels spin, the vehicle will break traction and slide down the grade.

==Alternatives==
Limited-slip differentials (LSD) are considered a compromise between a standard differential and a locking differential because they operate more smoothly, and they do direct some extra torque to the wheel with the most traction compared to a standard differential, but are not capable of 100% lockup.

Traction control systems are also used in many modern vehicles, either in addition to, or as a replacement of, locking differentials. Examples include: Volkswagen&#x27;s electronic differential lock (EDL), Opel&#x27;s TC+ installed for the first time in Opel Astra G (2001), et cetera. This is not in fact a differential lock, but operates at each wheel. Sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating more than a specified number of revolutions per minute (e.g. 100) than the other (i.e. slipping) the traction control system momentarily brakes it. This transfers more power to the other wheel, but still employs the open differential, which is the same as on cars without the EDL option. If all drive wheels lose traction, then throttle control may be automatically applied. Electronic traction control systems may be integrated with anti-lock braking systems, which have a similar action on braking and use some similar components. Such systems are used for example on the most recent Nissan Pathfinder, Land Rover Defender, Land Rover Freelander, the McLaren P1 and the McLaren 650s.

Welded differential (commonly referred to as welded diff), the gears in a (open) differential are welded together as to function as if there was no differential. This is a cheap alternative for offroading or drifting.

Individual wheel drive (IWD), using separate engines, motors and/or gearboxes for each wheel in a vehicle, so that there is no need for torque distribution with drivetrain components from a centralised location.

<text>Sammy Kaye (born Samuel Zarnocay Jr.; March 13, 1910 – June 2, 1987) was an American bandleader and songwriter, whose tag line, &quot;Swing and Sway with Sammy Kaye&quot;, became one of the most famous of the Big Band Era. The expression springs from his first hit single in 1937, &quot;Swing and Sway&quot; (U.S. no. 15). He was the first to record and release the standard &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; in 1940. During World War II, he co-wrote and recorded the anthemic &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor&quot; (U.S. No. 3). He was the first to record and release the no. 1 song &quot;Daddy&quot; in 1941. His signature tune was &quot;Harbor Lights&quot;, a number-one hit in 1950.

==Biography==
Kaye, born in Lakewood, Ohio, United States, graduated from Rocky River High School in Rocky River, Ohio. At Ohio University in Athens, Ohio he was a member of Theta Chi fraternity. Kaye could play the saxophone and the clarinet, but he never featured himself as a soloist on either instrument.

A leader of one of the so-called &quot;Sweet&quot; bands of the Big Band Era, he made a large number of records for Vocalion Records, RCA Victor, Columbia Records, Bell Records, and the American Decca record label. He was also a hit on radio. Kaye was known for an audience participation gimmick called &quot;So You Want to Lead a Band?&quot; where audience members would be called onto stage in an attempt to conduct the orchestra, with the possibility of winning batons. Kaye was also known for his use of &quot;singing of song titles&quot;, which was emulated by Kay Kyser and Blue Barron.

He was the first to record and release &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; in 1941, a song which became a standard in several genres, including pop, jazz, Big Band, Swing, and rock and roll.

He was also the first to record and release the classic song &quot;Daddy&quot; in 1941, which hit no. 1 and which was recorded by other bands and singers.

Shortly after the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, Kaye wrote the music and Don Reid wrote the words to &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor&quot;, the tune of which was based on Ohio University&#x27;s &quot;Alma Mater&quot;. On December 17, 1941, RCA Victor recorded the song, with Sammy Kaye&#x27;s Swing and Sway Band and The Glee Club. The 78 single was released in 1942, reaching no. 3 on the charts.

By 1955, Kaye was also featured five times a week on several national radio networks through the RCA Thesaurus transcription service.

His band members included Ralph Flanagan. Singers included Don Cornell (not related to Dale Cornell), Billy Williams (the country music singer with the Pecos River Rogues), Tommy Ryan, Gary Willner, Barry Frank, Tony Russo, and Nancy Norman. All members of the band sometimes sang backing vocals in various combination as the &quot;Kaydets&quot;. Although his musicians were always competent, the jazz critic George T. Simon described them as &quot;magnificently trained and exceedingly unoriginal&quot;.

==Television ==
Kaye had the following shows on network television:
*&quot;The Sammy Kaye Show&quot; on CBS Television (1951–52)
*&quot;The Sammy Kaye Show&quot; on NBC Television (summer 1953)
*&quot;So You Want to Lead a Band&quot; on ABC Television (1954–55)
*&quot;Sammy Kaye&#x27;s Music From Manhattan&quot; on ABC (1958–59)

==Death ==
Kaye died at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey. His body was returned to Lakewood, Ohio and after a Mass at St. Christopher Catholic Church in Rocky River, he was buried in the family plot next to his parents at Lakewood Park Cemetery. Prior to his death in 1987, Sammy Kaye left his orchestra to Roger Thorpe of New Paltz, New York. Thorpe, an accomplished music professor at SUNY Dutchess and director of the Dutchess Jazz Ensemble, knew Sammy from over the years. Thorpe operates the orchestra to this day.

==In popular culture==
*In October 1939, Kaye&#x27;s &quot;sweet band&quot; sound was satirized by Charlie Barnet and his Orchestra with the song &quot;The Wrong Idea (Swing and Sweat with Charlie Barnet)&quot; written by Charlie Barnet and Billy May.

== Discography ==
==Compositions==
Sammy Kaye wrote or co-wrote the following songs: &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor&quot; (U.S. No. 3), &quot;Until Tomorrow (Goodnight, My Love)&quot; (U.S. No. 10), &quot;Belmont Boogie&quot;, &quot;Kaye&#x27;s Melody&quot;, &quot;Wanderin&#x27;&quot; (U.S. No. 11), &quot;I Gotta See a Dream About a Girl&quot;, &quot;I Miss Your Kiss&quot; and &quot;Bottoms Up (Let&#x27;s Have a Ball)&quot; with Sunny Skylar, &quot;The Midnight Ride&quot;, and &quot;Hawaiian Sunset&quot;. &quot;I Miss Your Kiss&quot; was released as a U.S. War Department V-Disc in May, 1945 as 433A during World War II for American troops overseas.

==Filmography==
* &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Iceland&quot; (1942)

==Legacy==

<doc id="879939" wikidata="Q1044291" url="?curid=879939" title="Carolco Pictures">
<text>Carolco Pictures, Inc. was an American independent film studio that was founded by Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna in 1976. Kassar and Vajna ran Carolco together until 1989, when Vajna left to form Cinergi Pictures. Carolco hit its peak in the 1980s and early 1990s, with blockbuster successes including the first three films of the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise, &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; and &quot;Stargate&quot;. Nevertheless, Carolco was losing money overall, requiring a corporate restructuring in 1992. The film &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; was produced as a resurgence for Carolco, but it instead lost them $147 million, and Carolco eventually went bankrupt in 1995.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Carolco Pictures was founded through the partnership of two film investors, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna. The two were hailed by &quot;Newsweek&quot; as some of the most successful independent producers. By the age of 25, Vajna went from wig-maker to the owner of two Hong Kong theaters. Then, Vajna ventured into the production and distribution of feature films. One of Vajna&#x27;s early productions was a 1973 martial-arts film entitled &quot;The Deadly China Doll&quot; which made $3.7 million worldwide from a $100,000 budget.

Their goal was to focus on film sales, with their first venture being &quot;The Sicilian Cross&quot;; eventually it went into financing low-budget films. Their earliest films were produced by American International Pictures and ITC Entertainment with Carolco&#x27;s financial support, and co-produced with Canadian theater magnate Garth Drabinsky. The name &quot;Carolco&quot; was purchased from a defunct company based in Panama, and according to Kassar, &quot;it has no meaning.&quot;

=== Rise ===
Carolco&#x27;s first major success was &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), an adaptation of David Morrell&#x27;s novel of the same name. Kassar and Vajna took a great risk buying the film rights to the novel (for $385,000) and used the help of European bank loans to cast Sylvester Stallone as the lead character, Vietnam War veteran John Rambo, after having worked with him on the John Huston film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot; (1981). The risk paid off after &quot;First Blood&quot; made $120 million worldwide, and placed Carolco among the major players in Hollywood.

On May 15, 1984, Carolco Pictures entered into a long-term agreement with then-up-and-coming film distributor and fledging studio Tri-Star Pictures, with Tri-Star distributing Carolco&#x27;s films in North America; HBO (a partner in the Tri-Star venture) handled pay cable TV rights, and Thorn EMI Video (later, HBO/Cannon Video) handled North American home video distribution rights. The first film under the agreement was &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot;. TriStar released the majority of Carolco&#x27;s films from that point on in the U.S. and some other countries until 1994.

The sequel &quot;&quot; (1985), was timed for the 10th anniversary of the United States&#x27; exit from the Vietnam War; that event garnered publicity for the new film, which also became a hit. Tri-Star and Carolco would eventually renew their partnership in 1986, which called for Tri-Star to distribute upcoming Carolco product, including &quot;Rambo III&quot;, in a new multi-feature agreement.

The release of the two &quot;Rambo&quot; films were so instrumental to Carolco&#x27;s financial success that the studio focused more on big-budget action films, with major stars such as Stallone (who later signed a ten-picture deal with the studio) and Arnold Schwarzenegger attached. These films, aimed at appealing to a worldwide audience, were financed using a strategy known as &quot;pre-sales&quot;, in which domestic and foreign distributors invested in these marketable films in exchange for local releasing rights.

Carolco entered home video distribution as well. Independent video distributor International Video Entertainment (IVE) was going through financial difficulties and was near bankruptcy. In 1986, Carolco purchased IVE in the hopes of &quot;turning the company around.&quot; The deal was finalized a year later. This resulted in Carolco paying $43 million to HBO/Cannon Video (successor to Thorn-EMI Video) in exchange for the video rights to two of Carolco&#x27;s upcoming releases, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; and &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot;, allowing Carolco to relicense the pictures to IVE. IVE merged with another distributor, Lieberman, and became LIVE Entertainment in 1988.

Fueled by the success of &quot;Rambo&quot; and their other offerings, Carolco expanded into various other business sectors over the next few years. This included video retail holdings, licensing of their IP, an international division (which included deals with John Carpenter and Alive Films, as well as Canada&#x27;s Alliance Entertainment Corporation), and television production and distribution via the buyout of independent syndicator Orbis Communications. In addition to its own library, Carolco also held the television rights to the films of Hemdale Film Corporation (including &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot;), Alive Films (including &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;), HBO Premiere Films (including &quot;The Glitter Dome&quot;), and future subsidiary The Vista Organization.

Carolco also attempted to buy troubled film distributor Orion Pictures and home video distributor Media Home Entertainment, but these deals failed. They also purchased the former De Laurentiis Entertainment Group production facility in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Vajna sold his share of Carolco in December 1989 for $106 million to Kassar due to increasing disagreement with Kassar over the direction of the company. That November, Vajna formed Cinergi Pictures, with The Walt Disney Company as a distribution partner. Kassar&#x27;s ownership of the company increased to 62%.

=== 1990–1994 ===
In 1990, Pioneer Electric Corporation of Japan acquired a share in Carolco.

Also in 1990, Carolco acquired the rights to make a sequel to &quot;The Terminator&quot; from Hemdale; the company already had the television rights to the original film courtesy of its television distribution deal with Hemdale. The company re-hired &quot;Terminator&quot; director James Cameron (who had worked as a screenwriter on &quot;Rambo II&quot;) and Arnold Schwarzenegger to star in a multi-million-dollar budgeted sequel, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991). &quot;Terminator 2&quot; was the highest-grossing film of the year and the most successful film in Carolco&#x27;s history. Halfway through the year, Carolco formed a joint venture with New Line Cinema to found Seven Arts, a distribution company which primarily released much of Carolco&#x27;s low-budget output. In 1991, syndicator Orbis Communications was renamed to Carolco Television, to better emphasize the Carolco connection. Also around this time, Carolco Home Video was established, with LIVE Entertainment as an output partner.

By 1990, Carolco purchased the theatrical film rights to &quot;Spider-Man&quot; from producer Menahem Golan via his studio, 21st Century Film Corporation. Golan had previously tried and failed to produce a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film for his former studio, the Cannon Group, and selling the film rights to Carolco—along with the home video rights to Columbia Pictures, and the television rights to Viacom—was his way of raising funds to revive production. Carolco subsequently began pre-production on the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film, and James Cameron was quickly hired as the writer and director. In 1993, towards the end of filming &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; carried the announcement that Carolco received a completed screenplay from Cameron. This script bore the names of Cameron, John Brancato, Ted Newsom, Barry [sic] Cohen and &quot;Joseph Goldmari&quot;—a typographical scrambling of Menahem Golan&#x27;s pen name, &quot;Joseph Goldman&quot;—with Marvel executive Joseph Calimari. Cameron stalwart Arnold Schwarzenegger was frequently linked to the project as the director&#x27;s choice for Doctor Octopus, and future &quot;Titanic&quot; star Leonardo DiCaprio was considered for the titular role, Peter Parker.

Carolco also attempted to make &quot;Bartholomew vs. Neff&quot;, a comedy film that was to have been written and directed by John Hughes and would have starred Sylvester Stallone and John Candy.

=== Decline and collapse ===
Though Carolco made several successful films in the early 1990s, including &quot;Total Recall&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, and &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, Carolco was gradually losing money as the years went on. Carolco mixed blockbusters with small-budget arthouse films which were not profitable. In addition, Carolco was criticized for overspending on films through reliance on star power and far-fetched deals (Schwarzenegger received a then-unheard-of $10–14 million for his work on &quot;Total Recall&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2&quot;; Stallone also had similar treatment). Losses of partnerships also threatened Carolco&#x27;s stability and drove it towards bankruptcy.

In 1992, Carolco underwent a corporate restructuring, invested in by a partnership of Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera of Italy, Le Studio Canal+ of France, Pioneer, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Each partner helped infuse up to $60 million into Carolco&#x27;s stock and another $50 million for co-financing deals. MGM also agreed to distribute Carolco products domestically after a previous deal with TriStar expired. In 1993, Carolco was forced to sell its shares in LIVE Entertainment to a group of investors led by Pioneer; it was later renamed Artisan Entertainment, which was bought by Lions Gate Entertainment in 2003. Cutbacks at Carolco also forced Carolco to make a deal with TriStar over the funding of the Stallone action film &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;: Carolco would have to sell full distribution rights in North America, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and France to TriStar in exchange for half of the film&#x27;s budget. Although a major box-office success, Carolco saw little revenue from &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; since it ended up becoming a minority owner in the film.

Carolco’s plans for a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film with James Cameron, which had an estimated budget of $50 million, were forced to be shelved, following a period of litigation; in April 1993, Menahem Golan filed a lawsuit against Carolco to revoke his contract with them, since Cameron had Golan’s executive producer name omitted from the film credits. In February 1994, Carolco filed a separate lawsuit against Columbia Pictures and Viacom, in an effort to gain their home video and television rights to &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, but the suit backfired, when Columbia and Viacom counter-sued Carolco. In 1995, Carolco, Golan, Columbia, Viacom, and Marvel were all subsequently sued by MGM, who believed they should have inherited the film rights, upon acquiring the Cannon Group and 21st Century Films. Since the court did not rule in Carolco’s favor, these lawsuits led to Carolco losing an additional amount of money, while the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film rights were reverted to Marvel and eventually sold to Columbia.

Carolco&#x27;s attempt to make more of its specialties proved to be more strenuous: Carolco had to shelve &quot;Crusade&quot;, an upcoming Schwarzenegger film based on a script by Walon Green and with Paul Verhoeven attached as director, in 1994 when the budget exceeded $100million. However, Carolco was able to complete a merger with The Vista Organization in late October 1993.

Carolco attempted a comeback with the big-budget swashbuckler &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;, with Michael Douglas in the lead. Douglas dropped out early in its production and was replaced by the less-bankable Matthew Modine. Geena Davis, cast as the female lead through her ties with then-husband, the director Renny Harlin, was already an established A-lister but was coming off a string of flops. MGM hoped to advertise &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; based on spectacle rather than cast. In an attempt to raise more financing for the projected $90–100million film, Carolco sold off the rights to several films in production, including &quot;Last of the Dogmen&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot;. In October 1994, Carolco ran out of funds and Pioneer invested another $8 million. In April 1995, Carolco announced that it was unable to make interest payments on $55 million of debt. In November 1995, Carolco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; was released that Christmas and became a box-office disaster. Carolco agreed to sell its assets to 20th Century Fox for $50 million. But when Canal+ made a $58 million bid for the library in January 1996, Fox, which by then lowered their purchase price to $47.5 million, dropped their deal.

A new partnership was formed between Carolco&#x27;s owner (Mario Kassar) and Cinergi&#x27;s owner (Andrew G. Vajna) in 1998. The duo formed C2 Pictures and produced &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; and &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot;, among other films.

=== 2015–2017: Resurrection of Carolco brand ===
Film producer Alexander Bafer purchased the Carolco name and logo years later. On January 20, 2015, Bafer renamed his production company Carolco Pictures, formerly known as Brick Top Productions. Bafer then recruited Mario Kassar as the chief development executive of the new Carolco. However, on April 7, 2016, it was announced that both Bafer and Kassar had left the company, Kassar taking with him one of Carolco&#x27;s planned projects, a remake of the 1999 Japanese horror film &quot;Audition&quot; which he was producing. Investor Tarek Kirschen was then inducted as Carolco&#x27;s CEO. In 2017, StudioCanal and Carolco reached an agreement whereby StudioCanal would have sole control of the Carolco name and logo and the Carolco Pictures company would be renamed Recall Studios. That agreement settled a legal dispute over the Carolco mark brought by StudioCanal. The arrangement took effect on November 29 of that year.

== Carolco&#x27;s library ==
After its bankruptcy, the assets of Carolco were sold off to other companies, most already sold during Carolco&#x27;s existence. In March 1996, Canal+ purchased the library in bankruptcy court for a value of approximately $58 million. The ancillary rights to Carolco&#x27;s library (up to 1995 with certain exceptions) are held by French production company StudioCanal, since its parent company, Canal+ Group, owned a stake in Carolco, eventually buying out its partners.

On September 17, 1991, Multimedia Entertainment acquired selected assets of Carolco&#x27;s television distribution unit Orbis Communications, which included the telefilm subsidiary Carolco Television Productions.

In 1992, Carolco Pictures licensed television distribution rights to its library to Spelling Entertainment&#x27;s Worldvision Enterprises in order to pay off debt. In North America, with certain exceptions, those rights are held by Paramount Television Studios through Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media as the successor to Spelling/Worldvision. All other rights in terms of home video were (and for a majority of the library, still are) licensed to Lionsgate under an ongoing deal with StudioCanal. Lionsgate, in turn, licensed those rights in Canada to Entertainment One (which in turn was acquired by Lionsgate in 2023), although theatrical rights to most of the library were split between Sony Pictures (for &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;), and Rialto Pictures (for the rest of the library not already retained by its original distributors or passed on to other companies). The video rights to most titles previously released by Lionsgate in North America are now held outright by StudioCanal, and sublicensed to Kino Lorber.

&quot;Showgirls&quot; was sold in pre-production to United Artists and Chargeurs (now known as Pathé); both studios retained the film.

StudioCanal itself held full distribution rights in France, Germany, Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. In other territories, StudioCanal licensed home video rights to Universal Pictures Home Entertainment until StudioCanal&#x27;s global distribution deal with Universal expired in January 2022.

<text>An electronic countermeasure (ECM) is an electrical or electronic device designed to trick or deceive radar, sonar, or other detection systems, like infrared (IR) or lasers. It may be used both offensively and defensively to deny targeting information to an enemy. The system may make many separate targets appear to the enemy, or make the real target appear to disappear or move about randomly. It is used effectively to protect aircraft from guided missiles. Most air forces use ECM to protect their aircraft from attack. It has also been deployed by military ships and recently on some advanced tanks to fool laser/IR guided missiles. It is frequently coupled with stealth advances so that the ECM systems have an easier job. Offensive ECM often takes the form of jamming. Self-protecting (defensive) ECM includes using blip enhancement and jamming of missile terminal homers.

== History ==
The first example of electronic countermeasures being applied in a combat situation took place during the Russo-Japanese war. On July 13, 1904, Russian wireless telegraphy stations installed in the Port Arthur fortress and on board Russian light cruisers successfully interrupted wireless communication between a group of Japanese battleships. The spark-gap transmitters in the Russian stations generated senseless noise while the Japanese were making attempts to coordinate their efforts in the bombing of a Russian naval base. Germany and United Kingdom interfered with enemy communications along the western front during World War I while the Royal Navy tried to intercept German naval radio transmissions. There were also efforts at sending false radio signals, having shore stations send transmissions using ships&#x27; call signs, and jamming enemy radio signals. On the other hand, there were also attempts by the Ottoman side to jam Allied wireless communications during the Gallipoli campaign.

World War II ECM expanded to include dropping chaff (originally called Window), jamming and spoofing radar and navigation signals. German bomber aircraft navigated using radio signals transmitted from ground stations, which the British disrupted with spoofed signals in the Battle of the Beams. During the RAF&#x27;s night attacks on Germany the extent of electronic countermeasures was much expanded, and a specialised organisation, No. 100 Group RAF, was formed to counter the increasing German night fighter force and radar defences. Cold War developments included anti-radiation missiles designed to home in on enemy radar transmitters.

In the 2007 Operation Orchard Israeli attack on a suspected Syrian nuclear weapons site, the Israel Air Force used electronic warfare to take control of Syrian airspace prior to the attack. Israeli electronic warfare (EW) systems took over Syria&#x27;s air defense systems, feeding them a false sky-picture while Israel Air Force jets crossed much of Syria, bombed their targets and returned.

== Radar ECM ==
 
Basic radar ECM strategies are (1) radar interference, (2) target modifications, and (3) changing the electrical properties of air. Interference techniques include jamming and deception. Jamming is accomplished by a friendly platform transmitting signals on the radar frequency to produce a noise level sufficient to hide echos. The jammer&#x27;s continuous transmissions will provide a clear direction to the enemy radar, but no range information. Deception may use a transponder to mimic the radar echo with a delay to indicate incorrect range. Transponders may alternatively increase return echo strength to make a small decoy appear to be a larger target. Target modifications include radar absorbing coatings and modifications of the surface shape to either &quot;stealth&quot; a high-value target or enhance reflections from a decoy. Dispersal of small aluminium strips called chaff is a common method of changing the electromagnetic properties of air to provide confusing radar echos.

== Communications ECM ==

Radio jamming or communications jamming is the deliberate transmission of radio signals that disrupt communications by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio to the point where the target communications link is either degraded or denied service.

== Aircraft ECM ==

ECM is practiced by nearly all modern military units—land, sea or air. Aircraft, however, are the primary weapons in the ECM battle because they can &quot;see&quot; a larger patch of earth than a sea or land-based unit. When employed effectively, ECM can keep aircraft from being tracked by search radars, or targeted by surface-to-air missiles or air-to-air missiles. An aircraft ECM can take the form of an attachable underwing pod or could be embedded in the airframe. Fighter planes using a conventional electronically scanned antenna mount dedicated jamming pods instead or, in the case of the US, German, and Italian air forces, may rely on electronic warfare aircraft to carry them. ECM pods vary widely in power and capability; while many fighter aircraft are capable of carrying an ECM pod, these pods are generally less powerful, capable and of shorter range than the equipment carried by dedicated ECM aircraft, thus making dedicated ECM aircraft an important part of any airforce’s inventory.

=== Future airborne jammers ===
The Next Generation Jammer is being developed to replace the current AN/ALQ-99 carried on the E/A-18G electronic warfare plane. Planned for adoption around 2020, it will use a small AESA antenna divided into quadrants for all around coverage and retain the capability of highly directional jamming.

DARPA&#x27;s Precision Electronic Warfare (PREW) project aims to develop a low-cost system capable of synchronizing several simple airborne jamming pods with enough precision to replicate the directionality of an electronically scanned antenna, avoiding collateral jamming of non-targeted receivers.

An expendable active decoy that uses DRFM technology to jam RF based threats has already been developed by Selex ES (merged into Leonardo new name of Finmeccanica since 2017). The system, named BriteCloud, is self-contained within a small canister that is similar to a standard flare cartridge. The 55 mm format of the system has undergone flight trials with the Gripen aircraft and the development of a 218 variant is at an advanced stage.

== Shipboard ECM ==
The ULQ-6 deception transmitter was one of the earlier shipboard ECM installations. The Raytheon SLQ-32 shipboard ECM package came in three versions providing warning, identification and bearing information about radar-guided cruise missiles. The SLQ-32 V3 included quick reaction electronic countermeasures for cruisers and large amphibious ships and auxiliaries in addition to the RBOC (Rapid Blooming Off-board Chaff) launchers found on most surface ships. The BLR-14 Submarine Acoustic Warfare System (or SAWS) provides an integrated receiver, processor, display, and countermeasures launch system for submarines.

== Infrared and acoustic analogies ==
Infrared homing systems can be decoyed with flares and other infrared countermeasures. Acoustic homing and detection systems used for ships are also susceptible to countermeasures. United States warships use Masker and PRAIRIE (propeller AIR Ingestion and Emission) systems to create small air bubbles around a ship&#x27;s hull and wake to reduce sound transmission. Surface ships tow noisemakers like the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie to decoy homing torpedoes. Submarines can deploy similar acoustic device countermeasures (or ADCs) from a 3-inch (75-mm) signal launching tube. United States ballistic missile submarines could deploy the Mark 70 MOSS (Mobile submarine simulator) decoy from torpedo tubes to simulate a full size submarine. Most navies additionally equip ships with decoy launchers.

<text>James Alexander McDougall (November 19, 1817 – September 3, 1867) was an American attorney and politician elected to statewide office in two U.S. states, then to the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate. A gifted orator, McDougall began his career as a civil engineer in New York, then read law, rising quickly to heights in his profession in Illinois, where he became a friend of fellow Illinois attorneys Abraham Lincoln, Edward D. Baker, and Stephen Douglas. Like many Americans, McDougall was drawn to Gold Rush California in 1849; he resumed his law practice and was elected second attorney general for the new state of California. In the election of 1860, Lincoln won the presidency as a Republican, Baker was elected Republican senator from Oregon, and McDougall was elected senator from California, joining Douglas in the Senate as fellow War Democrats. All three of McDougall&#x27;s Illinois friends would die in the six years before his term as senator expired. A noted drinker, McDougall once gave an address to the Senate disparaging a proposed rule to outlaw the sale of alcohol in the United States Capitol, but died shortly after leaving the Senate, &quot;...hastened by his indulgence in the bowl.&quot;

==Early life==
James Alexander McDougall was born on November 19, 1817, in Bethlehem, New York, and educated in the Albany grammar schools, where he excelled in mathematics and civil engineering. While still a young man, McDougall assisted the survey of the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, later known as the Albany and Schenectady, one of the first railroads in the nation. McDougall began the study of law in Albany before moving westward, settled in Pike County, Illinois, in 1838, married the daughter of a leading Jacksonville attorney, and joined the Democratic Party. He completed his study and began practicing law in Cook County, where McDougall soon made the acquaintance of another rising Chicago lawyer, Stephen A. Douglas.

==Political career==

===Illinois===
In January 1843 the 25-year-old McDougall was elected Illinois Attorney General; he was re-elected in 1844. &quot;Small in stature, he had uncommon strength of constitution, as well as of mind. He was a brilliant speaker, skillfully wielding the weapons of repartee, humor, and sarcasm, and made himself one of the most noted speakers of the West.&quot; During his tenure in the state capitol, Springfield, Illinois, rising tensions in Nauvoo, Illinois, gave way to violence when on June 27, 1844, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith was killed by a mob after surrendering to the custody and protection of the state. McDougall was involved in the negotiations by which the Mormons agreed to leave Illinois. Following his two terms as state attorney general, McDougall returned to private practice in Chicago, establishing a law partnership with Ebenezer Peck.

While traveling the circuit and serving as attorney general in Illinois, McDougall became friendly with many fellow lawyers, including Douglas, Edward D. Baker and Abraham Lincoln. By 1849, McDougall had been twelve years in the Prairie State of Illinois, and had made himself &quot;one of the most popular men of his state,&quot; but like many of his age was still looking westward. McDougall organized and accompanied an exploration of the Rio del Norte, Gila and Colorado Rivers reaching the headwaters of the Rio Grande in what would soon become southwestern Colorado Territory. Hearing news of the California Gold Rush, McDougall returned to Illinois, gathered up his family and possessions, and took the new steamship California to San Francisco.

===California===

Resuming his law practice, McDougall was elected California Attorney General in October 1850 but resigned after a year to accept a seat in the state legislature.

In 1852 McDougall successfully ran for Congress as a Democrat, pledging to get federal support for a railroad to the Pacific. He did introduce a Pacific Railroad bill, but it was opposed by Thomas Hart Benton. McDougall served a single term in the House before returning to law practice in San Francisco.

In the late 1850s, the Democrats in California split into factions over the issue of slavery, and the election of a California Senator in 1861 became entangled in the national crisis over secession. When it appeared that a secessionist Democrat might be elected, Republicans abandoned their own candidate and threw their support to McDougall.

===Washington, D.C.===
While serving in the U.S. Senate during the Civil War, McDougall again worked on behalf of a Pacific railroad project, but alcohol abuse made him ineffective. By 1862, McDougall was making a spectacle of himself and neglecting his Senate duties. He fought against some of Lincoln&#x27;s war measures, but he was mostly dysfunctional. Not once did he travel back to California during his entire six-year term.

==Later life==
Upon leaving office, McDougall retired to his boyhood home in Albany, New York, where he died on September 3, 1867, presumably of alcoholism. His body was sent to California, per his wishes, and buried in Lone Mountain Cemetery in San Francisco, later renamed Calvary; his remains were reinterred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California, in 1942.

<doc id="879946" wikidata="Q3495319" url="?curid=879946" title="Embraer E-Jet family">
<text>The Embraer E-Jet family is a series of four-abreast, narrow-body, short- to medium-range, twin-engined jet airliners designed and produced by Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer.

The E-Jet was designed to complement Embraer’s earlier ERJ family, the company’s first jet-powered regional aircraft. With a capacity of 66 to 124 passengers, the E-Jets were significantly larger than any aircraft Embraer had developed before that time. The project was unveiled in early 1997 and formally introduced at the 1999 Paris Air Show. On 19 February 2002, the first E-Jet prototype completed its maiden flight, and production began later that year. 

The first E170 was delivered to LOT Polish Airlines on 17 March 2004. Initial rollout issues were quickly overcome, and Embraer rapidly expanded product support for better global coverage. Larger variants, the E190 and E195, entered service later in 2004, while a stretched version of the E170, the E175, was introduced in mid-2005.

The E-Jet series achieved commercial success, primarily due to their ability to serve lower-demand routes while offering many of the amenities and features of larger jets. The E-Jet family is used by both mainline and regional airlines worldwide, with particular popularity among regional airlines in the United States. It also served as the foundation for the Lineage 1000 business jet.

In the 2010s, Embraer introduced the second-generation E-Jet E2 family, featuring more fuel-efficient engines. However, as of 2023, the first-generation E175 remains in production to meet the needs of U.S. regional airlines, which are restricted from operating the newer generation due to scope clause limitations.

==Development==
===Background===
During the 1990s, the Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer had introduced the ERJ family, its first jet-powered regional jet. As demand for the ERJ series proved strong even early on, the company decided that it could not rely on one family of aircraft alone and examined its options for producing a complementary regional jet, including designs that would be larger and more advanced than its preceding aircraft.

During March 1997, Embraer made its first public disclosure that it was studying a new 70-seat aircraft, which was initially referred to as the &quot;EMB 170&quot;; this reveal was issued concurrently with the announcement of the development of the ERJ 135. As originally conceived, the EMB 170 was to feature a new wing and larger-diameter fuselage mated to the nose and cockpit of the ERJ 145. The proposed derivative would have cost $450 million to develop.
While Alenia, Aerospatiale and British Aerospace through AI(R) were studying the Airjet 70 based on the ATR 42/72 fuselage for a range, AI(R) and Embraer were studying a joint development of a 70-seater jet since their separate projects were not yet launched.

In February 1999, Embraer announced it had abandoned the derivative approach in favour of an all-new design. On 14 June 1999, the E-Jet family was formally launched at the Paris Air Show, initially using the twin designations &quot;ERJ-170&quot; and &quot;ERJ-190&quot;; these were subsequently changed to &quot;Embraer 170&quot; and &quot;Embraer 190&quot; respectively. The launch customers for the airliner were the French airline Régional, which placed ten orders and five options for the E170, and the Swiss airline Crossair, which had ordered 30 E170s and 30 E190s.

During July 2000, production of components for the construction of both the prototype and test airframes began. Difficulties with the advanced avionics selected for the aircraft, supplied by the American company Honeywell, led to delays in the development schedule; originally, the first flight had been set to take place during 2000. On 29 October 2001, the first prototype &quot;PP-XJE&quot; was rolled out at São José dos Campos, Brazil.

===Intro flight===
On 19 February 2002, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, marking the beginning of a multi-year flight test campaign involving a total of six prototypes. In May 2002, the aircraft was displayed to the public at the Regional Airline Association convention. During that same year, full-rate production of the E-Jet commenced; this activity was centred around a recently-completed factory built by Embraer at its São José dos Campos base.

After a positive response from the airline community, Embraer launched the E175, which stretched the fuselage of the E170 by . During June 2003, the first flight of the E175 took place. In April 2003, jetBlue placed an order for 100 Embraer 190s, the deliveries of which commenced two years later.

Following several delays in the certification process, the E170 received type certification from the civil aviation authorities of Brazil, Europe and the United States in February 2004.

===Production===
In 2008, the 400th E-jet was delivered to Republic Airways in the United States. In September 2009, the 600th E-jet was delivered to LOT Polish Airlines.

On 10 October 2012, Embraer delivered the 900th E-Jet to Kenya Airways, its 12th E-Jet. On 13 September 2013, the delivery of the 1,000th E-Jet, an E175 to Republic Airways for American Eagle, was marked by a ceremony held at the Embraer factory in São José dos Campos, with a special &quot;1,000th E-Jet&quot; decal above the cabin windows.

On 6 December 2017, the 1,400th E-Jet was delivered, an E175; it had a backlog of over 150 firm orders on 30 September 2017.

On 18 December 2018, Embraer delivered the 1,500th E-Jet, an E175 to Alaska Air subsidiary Horizon Air, as Embraer claims an 80% market share of the North American 76-seaters. By this point, the fleet had completed 25 million flight hours in 18 million cycles (an average of h) with a 99.9% dependability.

===E-Jets Second Generation===
In November 2011, Embraer announced that it would develop revamped versions of the E-Jet to be called the E-Jet E2 family. The new jets would feature improved engines that would be more fuel efficient and take advantage of new technologies. Beyond the new engines, the E2 family would also feature new wings, improved avionics, and other improvements to the aircraft. The move came amid a period of high global fuel costs and better positions Embraer as competitors introduced new and more fuel efficient jets, including the Mitsubishi Regional Jet. The new aircraft family also includes a much larger variant, the E195-E2 capable of carrying between 120 and 146 passengers. This jet better positions Embraer against the competing Airbus A220 aircraft. The PW1000G was previously selected for use on competing aircraft.

In January 2013, Embraer selected the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G geared turbofan engine to power the E2 family.

On 28 February 2018, The E190-E2 received its type certificate from the ANAC, FAA and EASA. It was scheduled to enter service in the second quarter of 2018.

==Design==

The Embraer E-Jet family is composed of two main commercial families and a business jet variant. The smaller E170 and E175 make up the base model aircraft, while the E190 and E195 are stretched versions, being powered by different engines and furnished with larger wing, horizontal stabilizer, and landing gear structures. From the onset, the E-Jet had been designed to be stretched. The E170 and E175 share 95% commonality, as do the E190 and E195; the two families share near 89% commonality, maintaining identical fuselage cross-sections and avionics fitouts. The E190 and E195 possess capacities similar to the initial versions of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737. All members of the E-Jet family are available in baseline, long range (LR), and advanced range (AR) models, the latter being intended for long routes with limited passenger numbers.

The smaller members of the E-Jet family are powered by the General Electric CF34-8E turbofan engine, each capable of generating up to of thrust, while the stretched aircraft are outfitted with the more powerful General Electric CF34-10E, capable of producing a maximum of thrust. These engines have been designed to minimise noise and emission outputs, exceeding the requirements established by the International Civil Aviation Organization; the relatively low acoustic signature has enabled the E-Jet to be operated from airports that have imposed strict noise restrictions, such as London City Airport. The type is also equipped with winglets that reduce fuel burn and thereby improve operational efficiency.

The E-Jet family is equipped with a fly-by-wire flight control system. The flight deck is furnished with the Honeywell Primus Epic Electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) suite and has been designed to facilitate a common type rating, enabling flight crews to be readily moved between different members of the family without the need for any retraining/recertifying and providing greater flexibility to operators. Early operations of the E-Jet were frequently troubled by avionics issues; by September 2008, Honeywell had issued software updates that sought to rectify the encountered issues.

The main cabin is configured with four-abreast seating (2+2) as standard, and features a &quot;double-bubble&quot; design that Embraer has purpose-developed for its commercial passenger jets to provide stand-up headroom. The dimensions of the cabin were intentionally comparable to the narrowbody airliners of Airbus and Boeing to permit greater comfort levels than most regional aircraft. Considerable attention to detail was reportedly paid by Embraer to elevating the type&#x27;s passenger appeal. Many operators have chosen to outfit their aircraft with amenities such as Wi-Fi and at-seat power outlets. The windows of the E-Jet family are relatively large at in comparison to most contemporary airliners, such as the windows of the Boeing 787.

United and SkyWest have begun retrofitting their jointly operated E175 aircraft with larger &quot;wheels first&quot; overhead bins which can accommodate up to an extra 29 bags, an 80 percent increase in space. The airlines will modify 50 aircraft with the new bins in 2024, and if successful, plan to retrofit more than 150 aircraft by the end of 2026.

==Operational history==

In early March 2004, the first E170 deliveries were made to LOT Polish Airlines, other customers to receive early deliveries were Alitalia and US Airways-subsidiary MidAtlantic Airways.

On 17 March 2004, LOT operated the first commercial flight of an E-Jet, which flew from Warsaw to Vienna. Within four years, LOT was sufficiently pleased with the type to order 12 additional E175s. Launch customer Crossair had in the meantime ceased to exist after its takeover of Swissair, leading to the cancellation of these orders. Furthermore, fellow launch customer Régional chose to defer its order, not receiving its first E-jet—an E190LR—until 2006.

During July 2005, the first E175 was delivered to Air Canada, entering revenue service with the airline that same month.

In April 2013, Air Canada began the transfer of its 15-strong E175 fleet to subsidiary Sky Regional Airlines; this reorganisation was completed during September 2013. By July 2020, approximately 25 million passengers had flown on the Canadian fleet over a cumulative 650,000 flight hours, while a total of 25 E175s were in service on both domestic and transborder flights into the US, which were then being flown under the &quot;Air Canada Express&quot; branding. In March 2021, Air Canada announced its intention to consolidate all regional flying under the Jazz branding, thereby ending its affiliation between Sky Regional Airlines and Air Canada; accordingly, all of the E175s were transferred to Jazz.

Early operations of the E-Jet were not problem-free: the American operator JetBlue reported engine troubles with its fleet, while cold start hydraulic issues were experienced by Air Canada. Embraer had to undertake a rapid expansion of its product support network in order to satisfy the needs of its mainline operators; by October 2014, the company had two directly-owned service centers, alongside nine authorized centers and 26 independent MRO organizations around the globe, while directly employing 1,200 staff for product support alone. In response to customer demands, the company also developed web-based support.

BA CityFlyer, a subsidiary of British Airways, operates a fleet of 21 E190s, typically flying routes from London City Airport to various destinations in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. CityFlyer has publicly stated that a key factor in it opting for the E-Jet over competitors such as the De Havilland Canada Dash 8 was its greater speed. The procurement of E-Jets by CityFlier led to other competing British regional airliners taking interest in the type; on 20 July 2010, Flybe ordered 35 E175s valued at US$1.3 billion (£850 million), along with options for 65 more (valued at $2.3 bn/£1.5 bn) and purchase rights for a further 40 (valued at $1.4 bn/£0.9 bn), deliveries of which commenced in November 2011.

On 6 November 2008, the longest flight of an E190 was flown by JetBlue from Anchorage Airport to Buffalo International Airport over , a re-positioning flight after a two-month charter for vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

On 14 October 2017, an Airlink E190-100IGW with 78 passengers aboard inaugurated the first scheduled commercial airline service in history to Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, arriving at Saint Helena Airport after a flight of about six hours from Johannesburg, South Africa, with a stop at Windhoek, Namibia. The flight began a once-per-week scheduled service by Airlink between Johannesburg and Saint Helena using E190 aircraft. The inaugural flight was only the second commercial flight to Saint Helena in the island&#x27;s history, and the first since a chartered Airlink Avro RJ85 landed at Saint Helena Airport on 3 May 2017.

==Variants==
===E170===

The E170 is the smallest aircraft in the E-Jet family and was the first to enter revenue service in March 2004. As of 2017, the E170 went out of production. The Embraer 170 typically seats around 72 passengers in a typical single class configuration, 66 in a dual class configuration, and up to 78 in a high-density configuration. The E170 directly competed with the Bombardier CRJ700 and loosely with the turboprop Bombardier Q400.

There are four variants of the E170, the E170STD, E170LR, E170SU and E170SE. The E170STD is the base-line airframe, the E170LR increased its range by having a higher max take off weight (MTOW). The E170SU and E170SE are both based on the E170LR but limits its passenger number to 76 and 70 due to scope clauses.

The jet is powered with General Electric CF34-8E engines of 14,200 pounds (62.28 kN) thrust each.

=== E175 ===

The E175 is a slightly stretched version of the E170 and first entered revenue service with launch customer Air Canada in July 2005. The Embraer 175 typically seats around 78 passengers in a typical single-class configuration, 76 in a dual-class configuration, and up to 88 in a high-density configuration. Like the E170, it is powered by General Electric CF34-8E engines of 14,200 pounds-force (62.28 kN) of thrust each. It competed with the Bombardier CRJ900 in the market segment previously occupied by the earlier BAe 146 and Fokker 70. , it is the only aircraft currently produced in this market segment.

The E175 was initially equipped with the same style of winglets as the rest of the E-Jet family. Starting in 2014, the winglets were made wider and more angled. Those winglets and other changes to the aircraft over time have improved efficiency. Embraer said that aircraft produced after 2017 consume 6.4% less fuel than original E175 aircraft. The angled winglets increase the wingspan from 26 m (85 ft 4 in) to 28.65 m (93 ft 11 in). This winglet change was only made available to the E175 and no other models in the family.

There are four different variants of the E175 airframe, E175STD, E175LR, E175SU and E175SC. The E175STD (standard) is the base-line version of the E175, the E175LR (long range) increased its range by having a higher max take off weight (MTOW) and max ramp weight. The E175SU is based on the E175LR but limits its max passenger seating capacity to 76 due to American regional market scope clause limitations. In late 2017, Embraer announced the E175SC (special configuration), officially designated as ERJ 170-200 LL, limited to 70 seats like the E170 to take advantage of the E175 performance improvements but still comply with US airline scope clauses limiting operators to 70 seats. Embraer is marketing the E175SC as a replacement for the older 70-seat Bombardier CRJ700 with better efficiency and a larger first class.

In 2018, a new E175 had a value of US$27 million, projected to fall to US$3–8 million 13 years later due to their concentration in the US with more than 450 in service out of 560, with Republic and SkyWest operating over 120 each, Compass 35 and Envoy Air 90, after the similar experience with the CRJ200 and ERJ 145 demonstrates the limited remarketing opportunities.

, the E175 remains in production, with strong demand from regional airlines in the United States, which cannot order the newer but heavier E175-E2 due to scope clause restrictions on maximum takeoff weight.

===E190===
The E190/195 models are larger stretches of the E170/175 models fitted with a new, larger wing, a larger horizontal stabilizer, adding two emergency overwing exits, and a new engine. Embraer 190 is fitted with two underwing-mounted General Electric CF34-10E turbofan engines, rated at . The engines are equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC). The fully redundant, computerized management system continuously optimizes the engine performance resulting in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance requirements. The aircraft carries of fuel and is fitted with a Parker Hannifin fuel system.

Embraer offered three variants of the E190: the STD (Standard), LR (Long Range) and AR (Advanced Range). The STD served as the base model, while the LR featured a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) that was increased by while the AR featured an MTOW that was further increased by compared to LR, allowing more fuel to be carried. This enhancement extended the range by .

The aircraft is equipped with a Hamilton Sundstrand auxiliary power unit and electrical system. The GE CF34-10E, customers can choose between 5 different variants (-10E5, -10E5A1, -10E6, -10E6A1, -10E7), each with different performance and capabilities. It is the only powerplant offered for the aircraft. These aircraft compete with the Bombardier CRJ-1000. It can carry up to 100 passengers in a two-class configuration or up to 124 in the single-class high-density configuration.

On 12 March 2004, the first flight of the E190 took place. The launch customer of the E190 was New York-based low-cost carrier JetBlue with 100 orders options in 2003 and took its first delivery in 2005. 

Air Canada operated 45 E190 aircraft fitted with 9 business-class and 88 economy-class seats as part of its primary fleet. They were retired in May 2020. American Airlines operated E190s until 2020. JetBlue and Georgian Airways operate the E190 as part of their own fleet.

Largest operator of the type is Alliance Airlines with 64 E190s in the fleet which mostly took over from American Airlines and JetBlue to serve the Australian regional market, the rest are Aeroméxico Connect (37), Tianjin Airlines (35), Airlink (29) and KLM Cityhopper (28).

By 2018, early E190s were valued at under US$10 million and could be leased for less than US$100,000 per month, while the most recent aircraft were worth US$30 million and could be leased for less than US$200,000 per month.

=== E195 ===

The Embraer 195 is the further stretch version of the Embraer 190, it is fitted with two underwing-mounted General Electric CF34-10E turbofan engines, customers can choose between 5 different variants (-10E5, -10E5A1, -10E6, -10E6A1, -10E7), each with different performance and capabilities. The engines are equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC). The fully redundant, computerized management system continuously optimizes the engine performance resulting in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance requirements. The aircraft carries of fuel and is fitted with a Parker Hannifin fuel system.

Embraer offered three variants of the E190: the STD (Standard), LR (Long Range) and AR (Advanced Range). The STD served as the base model, while the LR featured a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) that was increased by while the AR featured a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) that was further increased by compared to LR, allowing more fuel to be carried. This enhancement extended the range by for the E195.

The aircraft is equipped with a Hamilton Sundstrand auxiliary power unit and electrical system. The GE CF34-10E, rated at 18,500 lb (82.30 kN), is the only powerplant offered for the aircraft. These aircraft compete with the Airbus A220-100, Boeing 717-200, Boeing 737-500, Boeing 737-600, and the Airbus A318. It can carry up to 100 passengers in a two-class configuration or up to 124 in the single-class high-density configuration.

The first flight of the E195 occurred on December 7, 2004. British low-cost carrier Flybe was the first operator of the E195, had 14 orders and 12 options, and started E195 operations on 22 September 2006. Flybe have since decided that they would remove the aircraft from their fleet in favour of the Dash 8 Q400 and Embraer 175, in an effort to reduce costs, by 2020.

The largest operators of the largest variant in the E-Jet family are Azul Brazilian Airlines (45), Tianjin Airlines (17), Austrian Airlines (17), Air Dolomiti (17) and LOT Polish Airlines (16).

=== Freighter conversions ===
On 7 March 2022, Embraer confirmed their intent to enter the cargo market, offering conversions of E190 and E195 passenger aircraft to freighters. These will make their first flights in 2024, with certification expected later in the year. The E190F will have a payload capacity of , while the E195F’s will be . The company secured its first order in May 2023 for ten aircraft from lessor Nordic Aviation Capital, to be delivered to Astral Aviation as the launch operator.

===Embraer Lineage 1000===
On 2 May 2006, Embraer announced plans for the business jet variant of the E190, the Embraer Lineage 1000. It has the same structure as the E190, but with an extended range of up to , and luxury seating for up to 19. 

The Lineage 1000 offers two different engine choices, the GE CF34-10E6 and the more powerful CF34-10E7-B. It was certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration on 7 January 2009. The first two production aircraft were delivered in December 2008.

===Undeveloped variants===
Embraer considered producing an aircraft which was known as the E195X, a stretched version of the E195. It would have seated approximately 130 passengers. The E195X was apparently a response to an American Airlines request for an aircraft to replace its McDonnell Douglas MD-80s. Embraer abandoned plans for the 195X in May 2010, following concerns that its flight range would be too short.

===Commercial names and official model designations===
The commercial names used for the E170 and E190 families differ from the official model designations, as used (for instance) with the Type-Certificates, and in national registries.


== Operators ==

, the three largest operators of the E-Jet family were SkyWest Airlines (241), Republic Airways (208), and Envoy Air (152), operating variably for Alaska Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express.

==Accidents and incidents==
The E-Jet has been involved in 22 incidents, including nine hull losses:

=== Accidents with fatalities ===

;Henan Airlines Flight 8387 – 44 casualties
: On 24 August 2010, Henan Airlines Flight 8387, an E190 that departed from Harbin, China, crash-landed about 1 km short of the runway at Yichun Lindu Airport, resulting in 44 deaths. The final investigation report, released in June 2012, concluded that the flight crew failed to observe safety procedures for operations in low visibility.
;Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554 – 2 casualties among hijackers
: On 29 June 2012, Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554, six passengers carrying explosives stood up and announced a hijacking, but they were subdued by other passengers. The E190 returned to Hotan Airport where the hijackers were apprehended and two of them later died in hospital from injuries received in the fight.
;LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 – 33 casualties
: On 29 November 2013, LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470, an E190, crashed in Namibia, killing all 33 aboard (27 passengers, 6 crew members) by the deliberate actions of the pilot. The first officer reportedly left the cockpit to use the bathroom. He was then locked out by the captain, who dramatically reduced the aircraft&#x27;s altitude and ignored various automated warnings ahead of the high-speed impact.
;Envoy Air – 1 ground worker casualty
: On 31 December 2022, a baggage handler employed by Piedmont Airlines, an American Airlines regional carrier, was killed on the ramp at Montgomery Regional Airport when sucked into the jet engine of an Embraer 175 which was scheduled to fly as American Airlines Flight 3408.
;KLM Cityhopper – 1 ground worker casualty
: On 29 May 2024, a worker was sucked into the engine of an Embraer Jet owned by KLM Cityhopper at Amsterdam airport. Dutch authorities stated that the death was a suicide.
;Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 – 38 casualties
: On 25 December 2024, Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243, an E190, crashed on approach to Aktau International Airport in Kazakhstan. The flight was originally supposed to land at Grozny International Airport but was forced to divert due to fog in Grozny. According to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Azerbaijani investigators believed that a Russian Pantsir-S1 air-defence system damaged the plane before it crashed. Out of the 67 passengers on board, 38 people were killed, and 29 others survived.

=== Hull losses with no fatalities ===
On 17 July 2007, Aero República Flight 7330 overran the runway while landing at Simón Bolívar International Airport in Santa Marta, Colombia. The E190 slid down an embankment off the side of the runway and came to rest with the nose in shallow water. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair, but all 60 aboard evacuated unharmed.

On 16 September 2011, an E190 operated by TAME landed long and ran off the end of the runway at Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito, colliding with approach equipment and a brick wall. The crew reportedly failed to adhere to the manufacturer&#x27;s procedures in the event of a flap malfunction, continuing the approach in spite of the aircraft&#x27;s condition. Eleven of the 103 aboard received minor injuries, and the aircraft was written off.

On 31 July 2018, Aeroméxico Connect Flight 2431, an E190 bound for Mexico City, crashed in Durango, Mexico shortly after takeoff. 99 passengers and 4 crew were on board. Although there were no fatalities, the aircraft was destroyed by the ensuing fire. The probable cause was attributed to &quot;loss of control [...] by low altitude windshear that caused a loss of speed and lift&quot; with contributing factors from the crew and the Navigation Services.

On 11 November 2018, Air Astana Flight 1388 on a flight from Alverca Airbase, Portugal, to Almaty suffered severe control issues including flipping over and diving sharply. The crew activated the direct mode for flight controls which allowed sufficient control to make an emergency landing on the third attempt at Beja Airbase in Portugal with serious damage sustained during these high-G maneuvers. It was subsequently written-off and broken up. The investigation revealed that the aileron cables were installed incorrectly, causing reversal of aileron controls. The investigation blamed the manufacturer of the airplane for the poorly written maintenance instructions, the supervising authorities for lack of oversight over the maintenance crew, who lacked the skill to perform the maintenance, and the flight crew for failing to notice the condition during pre-flight control checks.

On 18 February 2024, Air Serbia Flight 324 from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to Dusseldorf International Airport, operated by an E195 leased from Marathon Airlines, overran the runway on take-off and struck the runway&#x27;s instrument landing system antenna array. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, left wing root, and left stabiliser. After 58 minutes, the aircraft landed back safely at Belgrade, and there were no casualties. After the incident, Air Serbia cancelled its contract with Marathon Airlines; the aircraft will reportedly be retired and scrapped.

=== Other incidents ===
On 22 October 2023, Horizon Air Flight 2059 was operating from Paine Field in Everett, Washington to San Francisco International Airport when Joseph David Emerson, an off-duty pilot sitting in the jumpseat inside the cockpit, reportedly tried to pull both engine fire extinguisher handles on the overhead panel. The E175 aircraft was operating at 31,000 feet at the time, and had Emerson been successful at activating the fire extinguishers, both engines would have shut down. The crew was able to subdue him and land at the Portland International Airport in Oregon, where Emerson was arrested and later charged with 83 counts of attempted murder.

On 9 April 2017, a passenger was dragged off a United Express flight after he refused to get up from his seat. In the process, the security officers struck the face of David Dao, a Vietnamese-American, knocking him unconscious. This incident was highly criticized. This incident happened at Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport. The aircraft was operating a Republic Airways flight under United Express trademark.

<text>Agaléga () is a dependency of Mauritius, as defined by the Constitution of Mauritius, which consists of two outer islands located in the Indian Ocean, about north of Mauritius Island.

Similar to other Mauritian islands such as St. Brandon, Agaléga is run directly by the Prime Minister of Mauritius through the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office to the Outer Island Development Corporation (OIDC). The population of the islands rose from 289 in 2011 to 330 in 2022.

The islands have a total area of . The North island is long and wide, while the South island is long and wide. The North Island is home to the islands&#x27; airstrip and the capital Vingt-Cinq. The islands are known for their production of coconuts, their main industry and, also, for the Agalega day gecko.

==Etymology==

# One hypothesis is that the Portuguese explorer, Dom Pedro Mascarenhas, named Agaléga and the island of Sainte Marie (off the east coast of Madagascar) in honour of his two sailboats, the &quot; and the &quot; in 1512, when he discovered Mauritius and Réunion Island.
# Another, more probable explanation relates to the Galician explorer João da Nova, who discovered the islands in 1501 while working for the Portuguese. João was popularly known by his sailors as , according to Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès&#x27; (Volume 38, page 88). is the Galician/Portuguese word for someone from Galicia, North West Spain, and &quot;Agalega&quot;, is derived from the feminine version of this ( is the feminine article in Galician/Portuguese, and Galician for &quot;island&quot; is feminine, so would mean &quot;the Galician [Island]&quot;). or simply &quot;from Galicia&quot;.
# A further, less likely, idea comes from a story in Sir Robert Scott&#x27;s book &quot;Limuria: The Lesser Dependencies of Mauritius&quot;, where he describes the 1509 discovery of the Islands by the Portuguese mariner Diogo Lopes de Sequeira. According to this version, Diogo named the Islands , with the &quot;&quot; referring to putative gale-force winds hypothetically modelling the coasts of both islands. Scott suggests that maps of the region represented the islands initially as Gale, metamorphosing into Galera, Galega and finally Agalega.

==History==

As with the Mascarene islands, these islands may have been known to Arab and Malay sailors, although no written records have been found to confirm this. Agalega, or Galega, was examined by Captain Briggs of HMS Clorinde, on 12 January 1811, who seems to have fixed its location accurately, which was previously not the case. The landing was found to be difficult on account of the heavy surf, the island being surrounded by a reef. A former French privateer was, at this time, settled on the island, having under him a colony of negroes, who cultivated part of the land with maize and wheat.

The first settlement on the islands was founded by M. de Rosemond. Upon his arrival in August 1808, he discovered the bodies of two castaways and a bottle containing notes written by one of them, the privateer Robert Dufour. The only hill on the islands, Montagne d&#x27;Emmerez, derives its name from the second shipwrecked sailor, a Mauritian called Adelaide d&#x27;Emmerez.

Economic, infrastructural and political development of the islands did not begin until the arrival of Auguste Le Duc in 1827, a French administrator sent by M. Barbé to organise production of coconut oil and copra. There still exists a number of historical monuments dating from the period 1827 to 1846, made by slaves: the village Vingt-Cinq (named after the 25 lashes that were given to rebellious slaves), the Slave Dungeons, an Oil Mill, a cemetery for Blacks and a cemetery for Whites, among others. Auguste Le Duc also began construction of a bridge between the two islands, although it was swept away by severe weather.

Father Victor Malaval brought the Catholic Church to the islands in 1897 as the first missionary. An improvised chapel was built on the South Island.

The origin of its inhabitants was influenced by the political ructions in the world at the time: Mauritius became a British colony in 1810, the abolition of the slave trade, then the abolition of slavery in 1835, followed by the arrival of unskilled Asian labourers. The slaves themselves were of Malagasy origin or from Madras in India whilst some were freed from slave ships and others were from the slave trading ports of the Comoros Islands.

Legends such as &quot;Calèche Blanc&quot; and &quot;Princesse Malgache&quot; are part of the folklore of the islands, as well as the coded language of &quot;Madam langaz Seret&quot; which has come down from the time of slavery. This language is a mixture of French and Mauritian Creole where every syllable is doubled with the first consonants replaced by the &quot;g&quot; (e.g. &quot;Français&quot; becomes &quot;frangrançaisgais&quot;). The origin, purpose and reasons for the evolution of this specific language remains unclear.

Today, the population consists of around 300 people, known locally as Agaléens (&quot;Agalegans&quot;), who speak Creole. Catholicism is the dominant religion.

A 2015 memorandum of understanding on India–Mauritius military cooperation envisaged developing the Agaléga islands for an Indian military base. Local residents vocally opposed construction of the base as being a threat to local employment, self-determination, creole language (Agalega creole) and culture and Mauritian sovereignty. These recent infrastructural developments by India, for civil and military use, have significantly transformed the islands&#x27; landscape.

On 11 December 2024, Cyclone Chido made landfall near North Island, destroying most of the island&#x27;s homes and leaving Agaléga without power.

==Geography==

North Island is long and wide while South Island is long and wide. The total area of both islands is . The soil is likely coral. The culmination is at the top of the hill Emmer on the island in the north. The climate is hot and humid and the average annual temperature is , ranging from a minimum of and a maximum of . April is the hottest month of the year. The tropical climate is conducive to the development of mangrove and coconut trees that cover the two islets.

===Climate===
==Economy==

Agaléga is managed by a company of the State of Mauritius, the Outer Island Development Company (OIDC), a company which develops remote islands. The company delegates a resident manager, a kind of steward, who is the supreme authority on the two islets. The economy of the archipelago is based primarily on the exportation of coconut oil.

== Detachment of Agalega from British Mauritius ==
In the 1960s, the United Kingdom and the United States discussed separating Agalega from British Mauritius in a similar manner to the Chagos islands, but this was rejected on grounds of cost, political sensitivity, lack of immediate need, and poor anchorage. In the Chagos&#x27; case, the financial costs in 1965 were estimated at £10 million (approximately £250 million today) excluding the United States&#x27; secret contribution to the BIOT enterprise via the waiving of costs associated with Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons acquisitions. The financial costs for Britain to create BIOT were high. Acquiring Agaléga would have increased Britain&#x27;s financial burden, at a time when it was winding down its vast empire and reigning in its defense spending.

==Infrastructure==
Most homes are in the main villages of Vingt-Cinq and La Fourche on the North Island, and St. Rita on the South Island. The road connecting the different localities is sandy and coral. The North Island is home to an airstrip, a government primary school &quot;Jacques Le Chartier&quot;, the police station, the weather station, the central telecommunications office (Mauritius Telecom) and the health service. There is no running water on the island. Drinking water comes from rainwater collected by gutters. Water for other uses is sourced from wells. Electricity is supplied by generators running on diesel, with supply limited to certain hours. The company that manages the remote islands, such as Agaléga and St Brandon, is working on a project to ensure power supply to these islands, via submarine connection.

Agaléga is connected to Mauritius by air and sea. The civilian airstrip on the island in the north allows takeoff and landing of small aircraft. There is now a new 10,000 foot long modern airstrip suitable for jet aircraft. There is no functional port on the islands, only a pier at St James Anchorage on the island&#x27;s north. Vessels of the Mauritius Shipping Corporation (the Pride Mauritius and the Mauritius Trochetia) cast anchor about from this place, in the deep sea, during refueling.

Health services are provided by a health officer and a midwife. Doctors from Mauritius make short tours throughout the year. The Agaléens also receive a visit from a magistrate during the year.

For education, there is a primary school for the young, but pupils then continue their education in secondary schools on the island of Mauritius.

<text>Zübeyde [[Khanum|Hanım]] (1857 – 15 January 1923) was the mother of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey. She was the only daughter of the Hacısofular family which included her two brothers. Zübeyde was born in Langaza village (now in Thessaloniki regional unit), Ottoman Empire in 1857 as the daughter of a Turkish peasant. The Hacısofular family migrated to Macedonia after the collapse of the Karamanids.

==Early life==
Zübeyde Hanım was born in 1857 in Lagkadas to a Turkish family, and according to historian Şevket Süreyya Aydemir, she was of Turkic Yörük origin. Some alleged that she was of either Macedonian or Bulgarian ancestry. It has been also claimed by some historians that she was of Albanian descent. Zübeyde spent her early life on a farm in southern Albania, the daughter of a small tenant. She was described as blonde-haired, blue-eyed, and of robust stature. This ethnic background is believed to have influenced her son, Mustafa Kemal, later known as Atatürk.

Zübeyde Hanım&#x27;s education was basic and only consisted of learning to read and write. Because she could read and write, she was nicknamed Zübeyde Molla (someone knowledgeable and teaches other people, in particular, a teacher of theology) by some people.

Zübeyde Hanım was a devout Muslim and as a result of her pious upbringing she enrolled her son Mustafa in a local school (&quot;mahalle mektebi&quot;), an Islamic school that teaches the Qur&#x27;an.

Zübeyde Hanım&#x27;s first marriage in 1871 was to Ali Rıza Efendi. She was 14 or 15 years old and he was 32. With her dark blonde hair, deep blue eyes and fair skin, she won the admiration of Ali Rıza, a border guard. Ali Rıza&#x27;s older sister arranged this marriage - as was the tradition at that time. Zübeyde Hanım was in her early teens and 20 years younger than her husband. Their first child was Fatma, followed by Ömer and Ahmet, but they all died in childhood. In 1881, she gave birth to a son Mustafa, and a daughter, Makbule in 1885.

Zübeyde Hanım, also gave birth to a daughter Naciye in 1889, but she died of tuberculosis in childhood.

== Zübeyde and Kemal==

She was widowed at a young age, as her husband died when their son Mustafa was six years old.

Following his death, Zübeyde Hanım moved with her two children, Mustafa and Makbule to live with her brother, Husein, who was the manager of a farm outside Salonica.

In her second marriage she was married to Ragıp Bey, who had four children from his previous marriage.
She could not see Mustafa Kemal during the Turkish War of Independence in 1919.

==Later life==

After the Balkan Wars, when the Ottomans lost Salonica to Greece, she moved to a house in Beşiktaş-Akaretler, Istanbul with her daughter Makbule. She moved to Ankara in 1922, but the climate was not suitable for her, so she was sent to İzmir.

She died on 15 January 1923, and a memorial was built for her in 1940, where she rests now.

<text>Google Ads, formerly known as Google Adwords, is an online advertising platform developed by Google, where advertisers bid to display brief advertisements, service offerings, product listings, and videos to web users. It can place ads in the results of search engines like Google Search (the Google Search Network), mobile apps, videos, and on non-search websites. Services are offered under a pay-per-click (PPC) pricing model, and a cost-per-view (CPV) pricing model.

== History ==

Google launched AdWords in the year 2000. Initially, Google itself would set up and manage advertisers&#x27; campaigns. Google then introduced a self-service AdWords portal for small businesses that wanted to manage their own campaigns.

In 2005, Google started a campaign management service known as &quot;Jumpstart&quot;.

In 2007, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion. The acquisition was strategically important for Google, providing access to DoubleClick&#x27;s advanced ad-serving technology and established industry relationships. This deal, while &quot;transforming Google into a powerhouse&quot;, later attracted antitrust scrutiny, raising questions about its impact on market competition and digital advertising dominance.

In January of 2007 Google purchased the radio advertising company dMarc Broadcasting.

In 2008, Google launched the Google Online Marketing Challenge, an in-class academic exercise for tertiary students.

Google retired the DoubleClick and AdWords brands in 2018 to simplify entry points for advertisers and ad sellers. The core product was renamed Google Ads, providing access to inventory on Google Search, its YouTube video service, the Google Play app store, and AdSense website publisher partners.

== Functionality ==
Google Ads&#x27; system is based partly on cookies and partly on keywords determined by advertisers. Google uses these characteristics to place advertising copy on pages that they think might be relevant. In 2023, Google introduced Topics API, which allows targeting ads based on browsing history stored in browser, to Google Chrome. Advertisers pay when users divert their browsing to click on the advertising copy. Adverts can be implemented locally, nationally, or internationally.

Google&#x27;s text advertisements mimic what the average search result looks like on Google. Offering text-only search ads initially, Google unveiled &quot;Showcase Shopping&quot; ads in 2016. With this format, retailers can choose to have a series of product images that appear in search results related to various search queries and keywords. In May 2016, Google announced Expanded Text Ads, allowing 23% more text. Image ads in the display network can be one of the several different standardized sizes as designated by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB).

Besides the Google search engine, advertisers also have the option of enabling their ads to show on Google&#x27;s partner network, members of which receive a portion of the generated income.

In 2024, Google Ads introduced AI-powered tools, including the &quot;Ads Power Pair&quot; of Search and Performance Max, designed to improve campaign efficiency across Google channels. These tools leverage first-party data, machine learning, and automated asset creation to enhance bidding, targeting, and audience reach.

=== Restrictions on ad content ===
The &quot;Family status&quot; of an ad (&quot;family safe,&quot; &quot;non-family safe,&quot; or &quot;adult&quot;) is set by a Google reviewer and indicates what &quot;audiences the ad and website are appropriate for.&quot; This will change at what time, on which page, and in which country an ad can appear.

As of December 2010, Google AdWords decreased restrictions on sales of hard alcohol. It now allows ads that promote the sale of hard alcohol and liquor. This is an extension of a policy change that was made in December 2008, which permitted ads that promote the branding of hard alcohol and liquor.

From June 2007, Google banned AdWords adverts for student essay-writing services, a move which received positive feedback from universities. Google has a variety of specific keywords and categories that it prohibits that vary by type and country. For example, use of keywords for alcohol related products are prohibited in Thailand and Turkey; keywords for gambling and casinos are prohibited in Poland; keywords for abortion services are prohibited in Russia and Ukraine; and keywords for adult related services or products are prohibited worldwide as of June 2014.

In March 2020, at the beginning of the Coronavirus crisis, Google blocked all face masks keywords from being eligible for ad targeting as part of a policy to prevent companies from attempting to capitalize on the pandemic.

Every time a user conducts a search on Google, Google Ads runs an auction in real time to determine which search ads are displayed on the search results page as well as the ad&#x27;s position. The cost of a Google Ads campaign therefore depends on a variety of factors, including the maximum amount an advertiser is willing to pay-per-click of the keyword, and the quality score of the ad (based on its relevance and click frequency and ad extensions).

Although an advanced bidding strategy can be used to automatically reach a predefined Cost per action (CPA), this should not be confused with a fixed CPA pricing model.

=== Conversion tracking ===
In addition to tracking clicks, Google Ads provides advertisers an ability to track and report other conversions that happen after the click such as purchases, sign ups or calls. Conversion tracking is implemented by sending an identifier to the advertiser&#x27;s website as a URL parameter, which is then used by advertiser to send conversions to Google Ads, allowing Google Ads to trace conversion back to the original click for reporting. Google also allows advertisers to install a pixel on their website that sends conversions to the Adwords account. This allows advertisers to target their ads to drive conversions more effectively. For most traffic, Google sends a unique identifier for each click (in a &quot;gclid&quot; parameter), allowing to determine source of conversion precisely. To comply with tracking restrictions on Apple devices, anonymized identifiers that aren&#x27;t associated with specific person are used (called &quot;wbraid&quot; and &quot;gbraid&quot;). Google Ads provides ability to report many of such anonymous conversions by using &quot;modeled conversions&quot; that combine additional customer details to deduce, which user to attribute the conversion to.

Google Ads can be integrated with Google Analytics 4 (GA4), which can improve conversion tracking effectiveness. This integration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of user interactions across different platforms and devices.

Google Ads introduced enhanced conversions to make conversion measurement more accurate.

In 2018, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that Google had paid millions of dollars to Mastercard for its users&#x27; credit card data for offline conversion tracking purposes. The deal had not been publicly announced.

== Google Consent Mode ==
The introduction of Google Consent Mode in 2020 represents an effort by Google to navigate the complex intersection of aggressive digital advertising strategies and the stringent global data privacy standards that regulate them. This feature, which allows advertisers on the Google Ads platform to adjust how cookies are utilized based on user consent, is a response to heightened privacy expectations and legal frameworks such as the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

While Google presents Consent Mode as a tool that enables advertisers to maintain compliance with privacy laws while minimizing disruption to targeted advertising, its effectiveness and genuineness in protecting user privacy have been subjects of debate. Critics argue that while the tool ostensibly supports compliance, it also allows Google to maintain its dominant position in the digital advertising market by providing a mechanism that superficially addresses privacy concerns without significantly altering the underlying data collection practices.

Moreover, the introduction of advanced features in Consent Mode V2 in late 2023, which includes more granular controls over data usage and conversion modeling based on artificial intelligence, raises further questions. These enhancements aim to mitigate data loss from users who opt out of tracking, thus preserving the efficacy of Google Ads. However, they also underscore the ongoing tension between user privacy and the business imperatives of digital advertising, highlighting the challenges in achieving a true balance between the two.

In this context, Google Consent Mode can be seen both as a strategic adaptation to regulatory pressures and as part of a broader industry trend towards more nuanced data handling practices. Nonetheless, the extent to which these changes genuinely benefit users, as opposed to primarily aiding advertisers and platforms like Google, remains a critical area for scrutiny.

== Technology ==
The AdWords system was initially implemented on top of the MySQL database engine. After the system had been launched, management decided to use Oracle instead but was eventually reverted to MySQL after the system became much slower. Eventually, Google developed a custom distributed Relational database (RD) known as Google Spanner specifically for the needs of the ad business. The interface offers Spreadsheet Editing, Search Query Reports, and conversion metrics.

== Lawsuits ==

Google Ads have been the subject of lawsuits relating to Trademark Law (&quot;Google, Inc. v. American Blind &amp; Wallpaper Factory, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.&quot;), fraud (&quot;Goddard v. Google, Inc.&quot;), and click fraud.

Overture Services, Inc. sued Google for patent infringement in April 2002 in relation to the AdWords service. The suit was settled in 2004 after Yahoo! acquired Overture; Google agreed to issue 2.7 million shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license under the patent.

In 2006, Google settled a click fraud lawsuit for US$90 million.

In May 2011, Google cancelled the AdWords advertisement purchased by a Dublin sex worker rights group named &quot;Turn Off the Blue Light&quot; (TOBL), claiming that it represented an &quot;egregious violation&quot; of company ad policy by &quot;selling adult sexual services&quot;. However, TOBL is a nonprofit campaign for sex worker rights and is not advertising or selling adult sexual services. After TOBL members held a protest outside Google&#x27;s European headquarters in Dublin and sent in written complaints, Google reviewed the group&#x27;s website. Google found the website content to be advocating a political position and restored the AdWords advertisement.

In June 2012, Google rejected the Australian Sex Party&#x27;s ads for AdWords and sponsored search results for the July 12 by-election for the state seat of Melbourne, saying the Australian Sex Party breached its rules which prevent solicitation of donations by a website that did not display tax exempt status. Although the Australian Sex Party amended its website to display tax deductibility information, Google continued to ban the ads. The ads were reinstated on election eve after it was reported in the media that the Australian Sex Party was considering suing Google. On September 13, 2012, the Australian Sex Party lodged formal complaints against Google with the US Department of Justice and the Australian competition watchdog, accusing Google of &quot;unlawful interference in the conduct of a state election in Victoria with corrupt intent&quot; in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

In December 2019, France fined Google €150 million for advertiser suspensions on Google Ads, arguing it had &quot;abused its dominant position by adopting opaque and difficult to understand rules&quot; which it was then free to &quot;interpret and modify&quot; at its own discretion.

In early 2022, Google suspended all ad sales in Russia in response to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Over 1,000 Russian businesses that had purchased pre-paid ads, which were neither delivered nor refunded, joined the bankruptcy proceedings of the Russian Google subsidiary.

== Controversies ==
=== Trademarked keywords ===
Google has come under fire for allowing AdWords advertisers to bid on trademarked keywords. In 2004, Google started allowing advertisers to bid on a wide variety of search terms in the US and Canada, including trademarks of their competitors and in May 2008 expanded this policy to the UK and Ireland. Until 2023, advertisers were restricted from using other companies&#x27; trademarks in their advertisement text if the trademark has been registered with Advertising Legal Support team.

In March 2010, Google was involved with a trademark infringement case involving three French companies that own Louis Vuitton trademarks. The lawsuit concerned if Google was responsible for advertisers purchasing keywords that violate trademark infringement. Ultimately, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Google AdWords were &quot;not a breach of EU trademark law, but that the content of some advertisements that are linked by Google keywords may well be in breach depending upon the particular facts of the case.&quot; Additionally, in some American jurisdictions, the use of a person&#x27;s name as a keyword for advertising or trade purposes without the person&#x27;s consent has raised Right to Privacy concerns.

In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in &quot;1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. Lens.com, Inc.&quot; that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased AdWords and other search advertisements using competitor 1-800 Contacts&#x27; federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging that its search advertising trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and is scheduled to appear before an FTC administrative law judge in April 2017.

=== IT support ban ===
In 2018, Google implemented a policy change that restricts the advertising of consumer technical support, including services related to troubleshooting, security, virus removal, internet connectivity, online accounts (such as password resets or login support), or software installation&quot;, Google&#x27;s Director of Global Product Policy, David Graff stated that the policy was intended to &quot;address abuse&quot; and &quot;fraudulent activity&quot; from third-party technical support providers, and that a verification program for legitimate providers would be rolled out &quot;in the coming months&quot;. This is yet to manifest, resulting in an effective ban on all IT support and repair related services on the Google Ads platform. Commentators have expressed concerns that this is an attempt by Google to stifle consumers&#x27; right to repair electronic devices.

=== Use by fossil fuel companies for greenwashing ===
Fossil fuel companies, funders and public relations agencies including ExxonMobil, Shell, Aramco, McKinsey, and Goldman Sachs are among the largest customers of Google Ads. One in five Google Ads for climate-related terms (e.g. net zero, carbon storage, carbon capture and energy transition) were paid by fossil fuel companies. A study by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and InfluenceMap found that Shell&#x27;s ads appeared on 86% of searches for &quot;net zero&quot;. Over half of users in a 2020 survey could not tell the difference between a normal Google result and a Google Ad. One of the study&#x27;s authors, InfluenceMap stated &quot;Google is letting groups with a vested interest in the continued use of fossil fuels pay to influence the resources people receive when they are trying to educate themselves. The oil and gas sector has moved away from contesting the science of climate change and now instead seeks to influence public discussions about decarbonization in its favor.&quot;

=== Anti-abortion clinics ===
A report conducted by the Tech Transparency Project found that women from low-income areas in US cities are more likely to be targeted by anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers than women in wealthier areas of the city. Many of these crisis centers have portrayed themselves as abortion clinics while advocating anti-abortion measures for pregnant women.

The research was conducted in Atlanta, Miami, and Phoenix with women from three different income brackets, using the phrases &quot;abortion clinic near me&quot; and &quot;I want an abortion.&quot; According to the results, Phoenix showed a 16% increase in crisis center recommendations from low to middle income, while there was a 49% difference when compared to high-income areas.

=== Funding of misinformation and hate speech ===
A study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;, an American far-right fake news website, had earned up to $1.1 million in Google Ad revenue between November 2020 and July 2021. The website was demonetized in September 2021; the decision took place a few days ahead of the airing of a French documentary in which a Google representative was confronted with printouts of ads on the site.

In October 2022, ProPublica reported that Google Ads was a major source of revenue for purveyors of disinformation in Africa, Europe and Latin America. The websites funded by Google promoted Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s false claims about voting system integrity in Brazil and COVID-19 and climate change misinformation in French-, German- and Spanish-speaking countries.

In May 2024, non-profit organization Check My Ads reported that Google Ads is funding OpIndia, an Indian far-right website known for promoting conspiracy theories and Islamophobic rhetoric.

<doc id="879963" wikidata="Q4059659" url="?curid=879963" title="Antony Acland">
<text>Sir Antony Arthur Acland (12 March 1930 – 8 September 2021) was a British diplomat and a provost of Eton College.

== Early life ==
Antony Acland was the second son of Bridget Susan (Barnett) and Brigadier Peter Acland. He was educated at Eton College, then in 1948 joined the Royal Artillery with a post-war &quot;emergency commission&quot;. After short army service he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, gaining a BA degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1953 (later upgraded to MA). After leaving Oxford in 1953 he went straight into the Foreign Office (FO).

== Career ==
After studying at the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies, Acland was posted to Dubai and then Kuwait, then back to the FO as Assistant Private Secretary to the Foreign Secretary (Selwyn Lloyd, then Lord Home) 1959–62. He then served at the UK Mission to the UN, first in New York City 1962–66, then at Geneva 1966–68. Back at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) he was head of the Arabian department 1970–72.

Acland was Principal Private Secretary to the Foreign Secretary (Sir Alec Douglas-Home, then James Callaghan) 1972–75. He was Ambassador to Luxembourg 1975–77 and to Spain 1977–79. He was Deputy Under-Secretary at the FCO 1979–82, a post which then entailed chairing the Joint Intelligence Committee. In 1982 he was promoted to Permanent Under-Secretary and head of the Diplomatic Service. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in April 1982 and Acland came into collision with the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, over the diplomatic response. At one point during a heated discussion he threatened to resign, whereupon Thatcher backed down and said &quot;All right, no more Foreign Office bashing.&quot;

Acland was Ambassador to the United States at Washington, D.C., 1986–91, then retired from the Diplomatic Service and was Provost of Eton College 1991–2000.

Acland was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford, helping to raise funds for the institute&#x27;s building and library.

== Honours ==
Acland was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1976 New Year Honours and made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in November of that year after the Queen&#x27;s state visit to Luxembourg, after which he was styled &quot;&quot;Sir&quot; Antony Acland&quot;. He was given the additional knighthood of Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1982 Birthday Honours and promoted to Knight Grand Cross of that same order in the 1986 Birthday Honours and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1991 Birthday Honours. He was Chancellor of the Order of St Michael and St George between 1994 and 2005. In 2001 he was given the rare honour of appointment as a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter.

== Personal life ==
In 1956, Acland married Clare Anne Verdon; they had a daughter and two sons, including Simon Acland. Clare died in 1984; in 1987 he married Jennifer McGougan.

He died in September 2021, at the age of 91. His death came one day before that of fellow Knight Companion of the Garter Sir Timothy Colman.

<doc id="879967" wikidata="Q7097526" url="?curid=879967" title="Operation Sealords">
<text>Operation Sealords was a military operation that took place during the Vietnam War.

==SEALORDS acronym==
SEALORDS is an acronym for Southeast Asia Lake, Ocean, River, and Delta Strategy. It was a joint operation between United States and South Vietnamese forces which was conceived by Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam (COMNAVFORV), and it was intended to disrupt North Vietnamese supply lines from Cambodia in and around the Mekong Delta. As a two-year operation, by 1971 all aspects of Sealords had been turned over to the Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVNN).

==Responsibilities==
As American forces prepared the South Vietnamese military to assume complete responsibility for the war under the Nixon Administrations Vietnamization policy, they also worked to keep pressure on the enemy. Due to the successes of Operation Market Time and Operation Game Warden; one of the few places left for the North Vietnamese to smuggle troops and supplies into the Mekong Delta was through the rivers, canals and lakes that were near the Cambodian border.

The Navy in particular spearheaded a drive in the Mekong Delta to isolate and destroy the weakened Communist forces. The Sealords program was a determined effort by the U.S. Navy and the RVNN in conjunction with the U.S. 9th Infantry Division&#x27;s Riverine Forces, the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam and the South Vietnamese Marine Division. The objectives of the Sealords operation sought to cut enemy supply lines from Cambodia and disrupt operations at their base areas deep in the delta. The operation, soon designated as Task Force 194, was developed by Vice Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr. who appointed it to COMNAVFORV in September 1968.

==Launching of Sealords==
Admiral Zumwalt officially launched Sealords on 5 November 1968 in the issuance of Operation Plan 111-69 with the blessing of the new COMUSMACV (Commander of US Military Assistance Command Vietnam), General Creighton Abrams. At that time, Allied naval forces in South Vietnam were at peak strength. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Coastal Surveillance Force operated 81 Patrol Craft Fast (PCF)s, 26 U.S. Coast Guard Point-class cutters, and 39 other vessels. The River Patrol Force deployed 258 patrol and minesweeping boats; the 3,700-man Riverine Assault Force counted 184 monitors, transports and other armored craft. Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) 3 flew 25 armed helicopters. This air component was soon augmented by the 15 fixed-wing OV-10 Bronco aircraft of Attack Squadron Light (VAL) 4, activated in April 1969. In addition, five SEAL platoons supported operations in the delta. In total, Sealords employed 586 American vessels of the Coastal Surveillance Force (Task Force 115: &quot;Operation Market Time&quot;), the River Patrol Force (TF 116: &quot;Game Warden&quot;), and the Mobile Riverine Assault Force (TF 117). Complementing the American naval contingent were the RVNN&#x27;s 655 ships, assault craft, patrol boats and other vessels. To focus the allied effort on the Sealords campaign, COMNAVFORV appointed his deputy, Rear Admiral William Hiram House, USN, the operational commander, or &quot;First Sealord,&quot; of the newly activated Task Force 194 in December 1968. Although continuing to function, the Game Warden, Market Time and Riverine Assault Force operations were scaled down and their personnel and material resources increasingly devoted to Sealords. PCFs, because of their shallow drafts and limited capacity for off-shore operations were tasked for incursions up rivers and canals, while the Coast Guard&#x27;s Point-class cutters were assigned coastal areas previously assigned to the PCFs. Task Force 115 PCFs mounted lightning raids into enemy-held coastal waterways and took over patrol responsibility for the delta&#x27;s larger rivers. This freed the PBRs for operations along the previously uncontested smaller rivers and canals. These incursions into former Vietcong bastions were possible only with the on-call support of naval aircraft and the heavily armed riverine assault craft.

==Operations==
In the first phase of the Sealords campaign allied forces established patrol &quot;barriers,&quot; often using electronic sensor devices, along the waterways paralleling the Cambodian border. In early November 1968, PBRs and riverine assault craft opened two canals between the Gulf of Siam at Rach Gia and the Bassac River at Long Xuyen. South Vietnamese paramilitary ground troops helped naval patrol units secure the transportation routes in this operational area, soon named &quot;Search Turn&quot;. Later in the month, Swift boats, PBRs, riverine assault craft, and Vietnamese naval vessels penetrated the Giang Thanh-Vinh Te canal system and established patrols along the waterway from Hà Tiên on the gulf to Châu Đốc on the upper Bassac. As a symbol of the Vietnamese contribution to the combined effort, the allied command changed the name of this operation from &quot;Foul Deck&quot; to &quot;Tran Hung Dao I&quot;. Then in December American naval forces pushed up the Vàm Cỏ Đông and Vàm Cỏ Tây Rivers west of Saigon, against heavy enemy opposition, to cut infiltration routes from the &quot;Parrot&#x27;s Beak&quot; area of Cambodia. Operation Giant Slingshot, so named for the configuration of the two rivers, severely hampered Communist resupply in the region near the capital and in the Plain of Reeds. Completing the first phase of the Sealords program, in January 1969 PBRs, Assault Support Patrol Boats (ASPB), and other river craft established patrol sectors along canals westward from the Vàm Cỏ Tây to the Mekong River in Operation Barrier Reef. Thus, by early 1969 a patrolled waterway interdiction barrier extended almost uninterrupted from Tay Ninh Province northwest of Saigon to the Gulf of Siam.

Further operations would be carried out on the Cua Dai and Hoi An Rivers in Quang Nam Province in I Corps, on the Saigon River as far north as Dau Tieng Base Camp in the Michelin Rubber Plantation in III Corps and on the Ca Mau Peninsula waterways in IV Corps. During the Cambodian Incursion in May 1970, Sealords task forces sailed up the Mekong River, crossing the Cambodian border, with forces reaching as far upriver as the capital of Phnom Penh. Since Operation Sealords was designated as a part of the U.S. military&#x27;s Vietnamization program, in February 1969 the U.S. Navy began handing over nearly 250 patrol craft and 500 motorized junks, formerly part of Task Forces 116 and 117, to the RVNN. Virtually all of these watercraft were captured by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam in 1975. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s role in Sealords officially ceased in April 1971 and became the complete responsibility of the RVNN.

<doc id="879968" wikidata="Q2904557" url="?curid=879968" title="Beloit College">
<text>Beloit College is a private liberal arts college in Beloit, Wisconsin, United States. Founded in 1846 when Wisconsin was still a territory, it is the state&#x27;s oldest continuously operated college. It has an enrollment of roughly 1,000 undergraduate students.

==History==
Beloit College was founded by the group Friends for Education, which was started by seven pioneers from New England who, soon after their arrival in the Wisconsin Territory, agreed that a college needed to be established. The group raised funds for a college in their town and convinced the territorial legislature to enact the charter for Beloit College on February 2, 1846. The first building (then called Middle College) was built in 1847, and remains in operation. Classes began in the fall of 1847, with the first degrees awarded in 1851.

Beloit&#x27;s first president was Aaron Lucius Chapin, who served from 1849 to 1886. 

The college became coeducational in 1895. In 1904, Grace Ousley became the first African-American woman to graduate from the college.

Although independent today, Beloit College was historically, though unofficially, associated with Congregationalism.

The college remained very small for almost its entire first century, with enrollment topping 1,000 students only with the influx of World War II veterans in 1945–46. The &quot;Beloit Plan&quot; was a year-round curriculum introduced in 1964 that comprised three full terms and a &quot;field term&quot; of off-campus study. The trustees returned to the two-semester program in 1978.

==Campus==
Beloit&#x27;s campus is within the Near East Side Historic District.

The campus has 20 conical, linear, and animal effigy mounds built between about 400 and 1200, created by Native Americans identified by archaeologists as Late Woodland people. One of the mounds, in the shape of a turtle, inspired Beloit&#x27;s symbol and unofficial mascot. The mounds on Beloit&#x27;s campus are &quot;catalogued&quot; burial sites, and therefore may not be disturbed without a Wisconsin Historical Society permit. Several of the Beloit College sites have been partially excavated and restored, and material found within them—including pottery and tool fragments—is held in the college&#x27;s Logan Museum of Anthropology.

In 2008 Beloit College completed a Center for the Sciences, which was named the Marjorie and James Sanger Center for the Sciences in 2017. The building was awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building certification. It also won a Design Excellence Honor Award in Interior Architecture from the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 2009.

In 2010, Beloit College opened the Hendricks Center for the Arts, a structure with dance, music, and theater facilities. The building previously held the Beloit Post Office and later the Beloit Public Library. The renovation and expansion of the facility is the largest single gift in the college&#x27;s history. The building is named after Diane Hendricks, chair of ABC Supply of Beloit, and her late husband and former college trustee Ken Hendricks.

Two Beloit campus museums open to the public are run by college staff and students. The Logan Museum of Anthropology and the Wright Museum of Art were founded in the late 19th century. The Logan Museum, accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, curates over 300,000 ethnographic and archaeological objects from 125 countries and over 600 cultural groups. The Wright Museum&#x27;s holdings of over 8,000 objects include a large collection of original prints and Asian art. Both museums feature temporary special exhibitions year-round.

The Beloit College campus shows two sculptures by artist Siah Armajani, &quot;Gazebo for One Anarchist: Emma Goldman 1991&quot; and &quot;The Beloit College Poetry Garden&quot;.

==Academics==

Academic strengths include field-oriented disciplines such as anthropology and geology. In 2012, the college ranked among the top 20 American liberal arts colleges whose graduates go on to earn a Ph.D.

The geology department continues a tradition that began with Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin more than a century ago. It combines a course load with field methods and research. The department is a member of the Keck Geology Consortium, a research collaboration of several similar colleges across the United States, including Amherst College, Pomona College, and Washington and Lee University. The Consortium sends undergraduate students worldwide to research and publish their findings.

The college created a center for entrepreneurship known as CELEB, founded by Professor of Economics Emeritus Jerry Gustafson (Beloit &#x27;63).

Beloit College&#x27;s average class size is 15 students, with one-third of courses having 10 or fewer students. Its three most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were Biology/Biological Sciences, Psychology, and Business/Managerial Economics.

==Student life==
Beloit students&#x27; housing options range from substance-free dormitories to special interest houses, such as the Art, Spanish, Outdoor Environmental Club (OEC), and interfaith options. Beloit College has fraternities and sororities. The school also has over 60 student organizations and clubs. As of 2022, there is a creative writing club called the Aardvark Authors.

The student newspaper, &quot;The Round Table&quot;, was founded in 1853 as the &quot;Beloit Monthly&quot;. The student radio station, WBCR-FM, operates at 88.3 MHz and streams online.
Beloit College has a frisbee golf course contained almost entirely within the college grounds. In April 2006, Beloit students broke the world record for the longest game of Ultimate Frisbee, playing for over 72 hours.

In 2011 Beloit College received the Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Campus Internationalization. 48 states are represented at the college and approximately 14% of the student body is from countries outside the United States. In addition, about half of all Beloit College students study abroad in places such as China, Russia, Brazil, Germany, India, and Spain. Each year, students can share their experiences abroad on &quot;Beloit and Beyond&quot; Day, when all classes are canceled so that everyone can attend the presentations.

The &quot;Mindset List&quot;, an annual list of the life experiences of entering college freshmen, originated at Beloit College in 1998. In 2019, the list moved to Marist College.

In 1969, like many campuses across the country, Beloit College received a set of demands from Black students called &quot;The Black Demands&quot;. Various students protested by overtaking Middle College, turning it into a Black Cultural Center, and gathering in front of the Richardson Auditorium before a scheduled board of trustees meeting. The demands were met but the college has not successfully implemented all of them, such as increasing the percentage of both black faculty and students to 10%. In 2018 Beloit College edited its bias policy to add a section on hate acts in order to address hate acts that occurred in 2006, 2015 and 2017.

==Athletics==
Beloit competes at the NCAA Division III level as a member of the Midwest Conference and fields varsity teams in football, baseball, softball, volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer.

==Recognition==
In 2023, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; listed Beloit College among the 388 best colleges. Likewise, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; gave Beloit College top rankings for National Liberal Arts Colleges, Best Value Schools, Undergraduate Research, Most Innovative Schools, and Top Performers on Social Mobility. In their unique ranking based on their assessment of the college’s contribution to the public good, the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Beloit College number 23 in the nation.

<doc id="879971" wikidata="Q1652415" url="?curid=879971" title="Theodosius, Metropolitan of Moscow">
<text>Theodosius Byvaltsev (; died 1475) was Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, from 1461 to 1464. He was the second metropolitan in Moscow to be appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as had been the norm.

==Biography==

In 1454, when Theodosius was still archimandrite of the Moscow Kremlin&#x27;s Chudov Monastery, he was promoted to the office of Archbishop of Rostov. After the death of Metropolitan Jonah in 1461, Theodosius became Metropolitan of Moscow in early May 1461.

Theodosius&#x27;s appointment marked a new period of actual independence of the Russian Orthodox Church from the patriarch of Constantinople. He was the first metropolitan appointed by the grand prince after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (in 1453), although his predecessor, Jonah, is considered the first independent metropolitan, as he was appointed in 1448 without the approval of the patriarch of Constantinople. Theodosius&#x27; appointment was, however, eventually blessed by Philippi, Metropolitan of Caesarea, on behalf of the patriarch of Constantinople in April 1464.

Since his first days as a metropolitan, Theodosius sought to eradicate unscrupulousness among the priests and educating the clergy in his province. Theodosius&#x27;s attempts at reshaping the clergy failed. When he started sifting through the priests and defrocking those unfit for preaching, many parishes were left without priests. Ordinary people had nothing against their priests, therefore, they started to voice their discontent and damn the metropolitan.

Theodosius also had to contend with a metropolitanate in Lithuania which threatened to take the western eparchies of the Province of Moscow, most notably Novgorod the Great, and was suspected of Latinizing, in which case these western regions would not only be lost to the Moscow metropolitan, but would go over to Catholicism and be lost to Orthodoxy altogether. The metropolitans of Lithuania had been opposed for several decades, going back at least to the tenure of Photius in Moscow, and would continue after Theodosius&#x27; tenure.

Theodosius resigned the metropolitan office and retired to Chudov Monastery, where he had previously been archimandrite, after only 3 years. He later transferred to the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra north of Moscow where he died in 1475. He is buried in the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra.

<text>Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie (born 16 January 1976) is a former Bahamian sprinter who specialised in the 100 and 200 metres. Ferguson-McKenzie participated in five Olympics.

Ferguson-McKenzie is assistant coach of track and field at University of Kentucky. Previously, she coached for four years at the University of Houston.

In 1995, she was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the
most outstanding athlete of the 1995 CARIFTA Games. In total she won 7 gold, 9 silver, and 2 bronze CARIFTA Games medals.

She had her first major successes with the Bahamian 4×100 metres relay team, winning gold at the Pan American Games and World Championships in Athletics in 1999, and taking another gold at the Olympic Games the following year. She won her first individual gold medal at the 2001 World Championships – having initially won silver, gold medallist Marion Jones was later disqualified.

The 2002 season was a career high for Ferguson-McKenzie: she won five gold medals, with victories at the IAAF World Cup and Grand Prix Final, and a 100 m, 200 m and relay gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Her performance in the 100 m remains a personal best, and her time in the 200 m was a commonwealth games record and fastest by any athlete that year. She won her only individual Olympic medal in 2004, taking bronze in the 200 m. Injury ruled her out for the whole of 2005. She failed to reach the finals at the 2007 World Championships, unable to compete with the new generation of American and Jamaican sprinters. However, she managed to reach the 100 and 200 metres finals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

She was the previous 200 m national record holder with a best of 22.19 seconds. Her record was broken by Shaunae Miller-Uibo (22.05 seconds) at the 2016 Jamaica Grand Prix. Her 100 m best (10.91) is the second fastest time by a Bahamian after Chandra Sturrup.

In 2014 Ferguson-McKenzie became the women&#x27;s sprints and hurdles coach for the track and field program at the University of Houston.

Ferguson-McKenzie was coached some part of her professional career by Henry Rolle.

==Career==
Ferguson attended St Andrew&#x27;s School in Nassau, Bahamas and graduated in 1994.

Ferguson graduated from University of Georgia from where she launched her senior athletics career since which she has gained medals at the Summer Olympics, IAAF World Championships in Athletics, Commonwealth Games and Pan American Games.

In 2002, she was appointed as an ambassador for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, she set the championship record in the 100 metres and in the 4×100 m relay with the Bahamian team, recording a personal best of 10.91 seconds in the individual event.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing she competed at the 100 metres sprint. In her first round heat she placed second behind Oludamola Osayomi in a time of 11.17 to advance to the second round. There she won her series to qualify for the semi-finals in a time of 11.21, this time finishing in front of Osayomi. Despite fellow Bahamian Chandra Sturrup being unable to qualify for the final with a time of 11.22 in the first semi final, Ferguson managed to qualify with the same time as she finished fourth in her race, while Sturrup finished fifth in hers. In the final Ferguson came to 11.19 seconds, which was the 7th position.

She competed at the 2009 Manchester City Games, winning the 150 metres final in 16.54 seconds. She followed this up with a win in the 200 m at the Meeting Mohammed VI d&#x27; Athlétisme in Rabat. At the 25th Vardinoyiannia in Rethymno, Greece, she ran a world-leading time of 22.32 seconds to win the 200 m and set a meeting record. Now trains in Clermont, Florida, at the NTC.

==Major competition record==
On 16 October 2002 Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

<doc id="879977" wikidata="Q699236" url="?curid=879977" title="Higaonna Kanryō">
<text>, and sometimes known as Higashionna West to distinguish him from his cousin, was a Ryukyuan martial artist who founded a fighting style known at the time as Naha-te. He is recognized as one of the first students of Fujian White Crane Kung Fu masters, namely Ryū Ryū Ko, in the Fuzhou region of China who returned with those skills to Okinawa. His student, Chōjun Miyagi, would later found Gōjū ryū Karate.

==Early life==
Higaonna was born in Nishimura, Naha to a merchant family, whose business was selling goods to the north of Okinawa and shipping firewood back to Naha. Firewood was an expensive commodity in the Ryukyu Islands. His family belonged to the lower Shizoku class known as the Chikudun Peichin.

The characters of his family name (東恩納) are pronounced &quot;Higaonna&quot; in Okinawan, and &quot;Higashionna&quot; in Japanese. In Western articles the two spellings are often used interchangeably. He had an older relative, 5 years older, called Higaonna Kanryu who lived in Higashimura and was known as &quot;Higashionna East&quot;.

==Martial arts==
In 1867, Higaonna began to study Monk Fist Boxing (Luohan Quan) from Aragaki Tsuji Pechin Seisho who was a fluent Chinese speaker and interpreter for the Ryūkyūan court. At that time the word &quot;karate&quot; was not in common use, and the martial arts were often referred to simply as &quot;Te&quot; (&quot;hand&quot;), sometimes prefaced by the area of origin, as Nafaa-Ti, Shui-Ti, or simply Uchinaa-Ti.

In September 1870, with the help of Yoshimura Udun Chomei (an Aji or prince), Higaonna gained the travel permit necessary to travel to Fuzhou, on the pretext of going to Beijing as a translator for Okinawan officials. There are records which show that in March 1873 he sailed to Fuzhou in the Fukien province of China. although this may have been a later trip to Fuzhou because accounts passed on by Chojun Miyagi refer to an earlier year of departure in 1870.

Aragaki had given Higaonna an introduction to the martial arts master Kojo Taitei whose dojo was in Fuzhou. Higaonna spent his time studying with various teachers of the Chinese martial arts, the first four years he probably studied with Wai Xinxian, Kojo Tatai and or Iwah at the Kojo Dojo. Kanryo then trained under a man referred to as Ryū Ryū Ko, but his name was never recorded as Kanryo Higaonna was illiterate. According to oral account, Kanryo spent years doing household chores for master Ryū Ryū Ko, until he saved his daughter from drowning during a heavy flood and begged the master to teach Kung Fu as a reward.

In the 1880s, after Ryūkyū was annexed by Japan, Kanryo returned to Okinawa and continued the family business. He also began to teach the martial arts in and around Naha. He began by teaching the sons of Yoshimura Udun Chomei. His style was distinguished by its integration of both &quot;go-no&quot; (hard) and &quot;ju-no&quot; (soft) techniques in one system. He became so prominent that the name &quot;Naha-te&quot; became identified with Higaonna Kanryo&#x27;s system. He travelled to China several times thereafter. His last visit was in 1898 when he escorted Yoshimura Chomei and two of his sons to Fuzhou. History records that they were blown off-course to Zhejiang and travelled by land to Fuzhou with an escort provided by the local Zhejiang authorities.

He began to teach Naha-te to the public in 1905 in the Naha Commercial School.

Kanryo was noted for his powerful Sanchin &quot;kata&quot;, or form. Students reported that the wooden floor would be hot from the gripping of his feet.

==Legacy==
Several of Kanryo&#x27;s students went on to become influential masters of what came to be called karate, amongst them Chōjun Miyagi, Kenwa Mabuni, Kyoda Shigehatsu, Koki Shiroma, Higa Seiko, Tsuyoshi Chitose and Shiroma Shinpan (Gusukuma).

<text>Kenneth Giles (1922–1974) was a British crime writer. Giles wrote books under his own name, as well as the pseudonyms Charles Drummond and Edmund McGirr.

Giles started as a sporting journalist, and used what he learned there as background for the Drummond novels. The Drummond books star Sgt. Reed, while the McGirr books star a private detective.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review of &quot;Death among the Stars&quot;, the American crime fiction critic Allen J. Hubin writes &quot;It will be a long while before I have had enough of Mr. Giles.&quot; The American critic Anthony Boucher, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; review of &quot;A Provenance of Death&quot;, Giles&#x27; first novel to be published in the United States, describes the author as &quot;promising&quot;, and the novel&#x27;s detective as a &quot;real working pro&quot;.

<doc id="879983" wikidata="Q1142552" url="?curid=879983" title="Historical kana orthography">
<text>The , or , refers to the in general use until orthographic reforms after World War II; the current orthography was adopted by Cabinet order in 1946. By that point the historical orthography was no longer in accord with Japanese pronunciation. It differs from modern usage (&quot;Gendai kana-zukai&quot;) in the number of characters and the way those characters are used. There was considerable opposition to the official adoption of the current orthography, on the grounds that the historical orthography conveys meanings better, and some writers continued to use it for many years after.

The historical orthography is found in almost all Japanese dictionaries, such as &quot;Kōjien.&quot; In the current edition of the &quot;Kōjien,&quot; if the historical orthography is different from the modern spelling, the old spelling is printed in tiny &quot;katakana&quot; between the modern &quot;kana&quot; and &quot;kanji&quot; transcriptions of the word. Ellipses are used to save space when the historical and modern spellings are identical. Older editions of the &quot;Kōjien&quot; gave priority to the historical orthography.

The historical orthography should not be confused with &quot;hentaigana,&quot; alternate &quot;kana&quot; that were declared obsolete with the orthographic reforms of 1900.

==General differences==
:&quot;This section uses Nihon-shiki romanization for , , , , , and .&quot;

In historical kana usage:
* Two kana are used that are obsolete today: &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot;. These are today read as i and e. Words that formerly contained those characters are now written using &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; respectively.
* Outside of its use as a particle, the &quot;wo&quot; kana is used to represent the &quot;o&quot; sound in some, but not all, words.
* Yōon sounds, such as &quot;shō&quot; or &quot;kyō&quot;, are not written with a small kana ; depending on the word, they are written with either two or three full-sized kana. If written with two kana and the last one is &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;yu&quot;, or &quot;yo&quot;, then it represents a short syllable of one mora, such as &quot;kyo&quot;. If written with two or three kana and the last one is &quot;u&quot; or &quot;fu&quot;, then it represents a long syllable of two morae. The first kana is not always the same as one used in the modern spelling, as in &quot;kyō&quot; &quot;today&quot;, written &quot;kefu&quot;. If written with three kana, the middle one will always be &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;yu&quot;, or &quot;yo&quot;, and the last kana will always be &quot;u&quot; or &quot;fu&quot;, as in &quot;chō&quot;, the counter for tools, guns, etc., written &quot;chiyau&quot;.
* The series of kana &quot;ha&quot; &quot;hi&quot; &quot;fu&quot; &quot;he&quot; &quot;ho&quot; are used to represent, in some words, the sounds &quot;wa&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, respectively.
* Precedence is given to grammar over pronunciation. For example, the verb &quot;warau&quot; (to laugh) is written &quot;warafu&quot;, and in accordance with Japanese grammar rules, &quot;waraō&quot;, the volitional form of &quot;warau&quot;, is written &quot;warahau&quot;.
* The kana &quot;du&quot; and &quot;di&quot;, which are mostly only used in rendaku in modern kana usage, are more common. Modern kana usage replaces them with the identically-pronounced &quot;zu&quot; and &quot;ji&quot; in most cases. For example, &quot;ajisai&quot; (hortensia) is written &quot;adisawi&quot;.

Most of the historical kana usage has been found to accurately represent certain aspects of the way words sounded during the Heian period. As the spoken language has continued to develop, some orthography looks odd to the modern eye. As these peculiarities follow fairly regular patterns, they are not difficult to learn. However, some of the historical kana usages are etymologically mistakes. For example, 
: &quot;aruiwa&quot; (or) might be found written incorrectly as &quot;*aruhiwa&quot; or &quot;*aruwiwa&quot;
: &quot;mochiwiru&quot; (use) might be found written incorrectly as &quot;*mochihiru&quot;
: &quot;tsukue&quot; (desk, table) might be found written incorrectly as: &quot;*tsukuwe&quot;

Those familiar with Japanese writing may notice that most of the differences apply to words which are usually written in Kanji anyway, and so would require no changes to switch from one Kana system to another (unless furigana are employed). In particular, yōon sounds occur almost exclusively in the Chinese-derived readings that are usually only seen in Kanji compounds (although not entirely; &quot;kyō&quot; &quot;today,&quot; written &quot;kefu&quot; in the old system, is a native Japanese word), and therefore do not look any different (without furigana). The relative lack of difference in appearance in practice between the two systems was a major reason the spelling reform succeeded, and also why the three grammatical particles &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;wa&quot; continue to be written as &quot;wo&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, and &quot;ha&quot; instead of &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;wa&quot;; many felt that changing these exceedingly common spellings would unnecessarily confuse readers. It is also for this reason that many character dictionaries continue to include the historical spellings, since they are relevant there.

Some forms of unusual kana usage are not, in fact, historical kana usage. For example, writing &quot;dojō&quot; (loach, a sardine-like fish) in the form &quot;dozeu&quot; is not historical kana usage (which was &quot;dodiyau&quot;), but a kind of slang writing originating in the Edo period. 
==Examples==
Here are some representative examples showing the historical and modern spellings and the kanji representation.

The table at the bottom gives a more complete list of the changes in spelling patterns.

== Current usage ==
Historical kana usage can be used to look up words in larger dictionaries and dictionaries specializing in old vocabulary, which are in print in Japan. Because of the great discrepancy between the pronunciation and spelling and the widespread adoption of modern kana usage, historical kana usage is almost never seen, except in a few special cases. Companies, shrines and people occasionally use historical kana conventions such as (Ebisu), notably in Yebisu beer, which is written &quot;webisu&quot; but pronounced ebisu. Also, some long-standing company names retain yōon in full-sized kana, like (Canon) or stamp manufacturer (Shachihata).

In addition, alternate kana letterforms, known as hentaigana , have nearly disappeared. A few uses remain, such as &quot;kisoba&quot;, often written using obsolete kana on the signs of soba shops.

The use of &quot;wo&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, and &quot;ha&quot; instead of &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;wa&quot; for the grammatical particles &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;wa&quot; is a remnant of historical kana usage.

== Table of differences ==
The following tables summarize every possible historical spelling for the syllables which were spelled differently under the historical system. When more than one historical spelling is given for a particular modern spelling, the various historical spellings were etymologically (and at one point phonetically) distinct and occurred in different words (i.e. in most cases, they are not merely different ways to spell the same word). The tables are sorted using the &quot;gojūon&quot; ordering system.

Note that the dakuten (voicing mark) was frequently omitted as well, as in the station sign at right. 



















===Table references===

===Notes===

*The spellings in the first table only apply to word-medial kana: word-initial occurrences of , , , , and were never written as , , , , or , respectively.
*In modern Japanese orthography, (&quot;di&quot;) is only used in compound words where rendaku causes (&quot;chi&quot;) to become voiced, as in ( &quot;hanaji&quot; &quot;nosebleed&quot;), and where it immediately follows a , as in ( &quot;chijimu&quot; &quot;shrink&quot;). Its use in rendaku is retained in order to avoid confusion about the origin of the compound. The usage of (&quot;du&quot;) in modern orthography is the same, used in rendaku and after a (&quot;tsu&quot;). In historical kana, however, and were sometimes used where and are used in modern kana. This originally represented a different phoneme (and still does in some dialects), but no longer does in Standard Japanese.

*The different spellings for the sokuon depend on what mora (if any) was elided into the following consonant to form the geminate consonant. For example, (&quot;gakki&quot; &quot;semester&quot;) is spelled (&quot;gakuki&quot;) in historical kana because the on&#x27;yomi of 学 used in this compound is (&quot;gaku&quot;). Geminate consonants in native Japanese words were formed either by the elision of a long vowel, as in (&quot;makka-na&quot; &quot;bright red&quot;; once , &quot;maaka-na&quot;), or by some random process, as in (&quot;kitto&quot; &quot;surely&quot;; once , &quot;kito&quot;); such words are written with the full-size (&quot;tu&quot;) in historical kana. In general, a Japanese on&#x27;yomi can end in either a vowel, , , , , or , ( and corresponding to Middle Chinese final &quot;-t&quot;, and and corresponding to Middle Chinese final &quot;-k&quot;), so these are the only four kana (, , , ) which can replace the sokuon in historical kana. Historically, on&#x27;yomi could also end with &quot;pu&quot; (for the Middle Chinese final &quot;-p&quot;), which was written as (&quot;pu&quot;, later &quot;fu&quot;) but eventually came to be pronounced &quot;u&quot; (as part of a diphthong).

*The historical spellings in the second row of tables represent every theoretical representation of their modern counterpart. It is possible, however, that some may not have occurred, or that they were so rare that they applied to only one or two words.

== Romanization ==
Readers of English occasionally encounter words romanized according to historical kana usage. Here are some examples, with modern romanizations in parentheses:
*Kwannon (Kannon): A Bodhisattva
* (Kaidan), meaning ghost story, the title of a collection of Japanese ghost stories compiled by Lafcadio Hearn
*Kwansei Gakuin University (Kansai): A university in Kobe and Nishinomiya
*Iwo Jima (Iō-jima; now officially Iō-tō): An island known as the site of a battle during World War II

<doc id="879986" wikidata="Q3832870" url="?curid=879986" title="Succession to the British throne">
<text>Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, sex, legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign&#x27;s children or by a childless sovereign&#x27;s nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover who are in &quot;communion with the Church of England&quot;. Spouses of Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.

King Charles III has been the sovereign since 2022, and his heir apparent is his elder son, William, Prince of Wales. William&#x27;s three children are next, in order of birth: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. Fifth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the King; sixth is Harry&#x27;s elder child, Prince Archie. Under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign&#x27;s consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.

The United Kingdom is one of the Commonwealth realms, which are sovereign states that share the same person as monarch and the same order of succession. In 2011, the prime ministers of the then-16 realms agreed unanimously to amend the rules of succession. Male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture was abandoned, meaning that males born after 28 October 2011 no longer precede females (elder sisters) in line, and the ban on marriages to Catholics was lifted. The monarch still needs to be in communion with the Church of England. After the necessary legislation had been enacted in accordance with each realm&#x27;s constitution, the changes took effect on 26 March 2015.

== Current line of succession ==
No official, complete version of the line of succession is maintained. The exact number, in more remote collateral lines, of the people who would be eligible is uncertain. In 2001, American genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner compiled a list of 4,973 living descendants of Electress Sophia of Hanover, in order of succession without omitting Roman Catholics. When updated in January 2011, the list included 5,753. The final person in both lists, number 4,973 and 5,753, was Karin Vogel (born 1973), a therapist from Rostock, Germany.

The annotated list below covers the first part of this line of succession, being limited to descendants of the sons of King George V, King Charles III&#x27;s great-grandfather. People named in are unnumbered either because they are deceased or because sources report them to be excluded from the succession. Exclusions are explained by annotations and footnotes below.

== History ==
=== England ===

The line of succession was governed by the common law rule of primogeniture until the fourteenth century, when Parliament first began to legislate on the subject. However, this was not invariably followed. The sons of William the Conqueror contested each other for the throne, and his granddaughter Matilda was passed over for his grandson King Stephen, even though Matilda&#x27;s father had been king, and Stephen&#x27;s claim was only that his mother had been William&#x27;s daughter. After the death of Richard I in 1199, the throne should have gone to his nephew Arthur, the son of his next brother Geoffrey, but as Arthur was still only a child, Richard&#x27;s youngest brother John was able to take the throne for himself, under the pretext that he was a closer relative to the late king than Arthur, who was one generation removed. John bolstered his claim to the throne by having his nephew secretly killed.

When Richard II was deposed in 1399 by Henry IV, Henry also usurped another relative with a better claim, 
Edmund, Earl of March. Richard and Henry were the grandsons of Edward III by, respectively, Edward&#x27;s first and fourth sons; Edmund was descended from Edward&#x27;s third son, and so was placed ahead of Henry in the line of succession. However, as Edmund was only seven at the time, and Henry&#x27;s position would not have been secure with any lesser title than king, Henry took the throne for himself, with the endorsement of Parliament. Decades later, the rival House of York, which was descended from Edmund&#x27;s sister Anne de Mortimer, seized the throne from Henry&#x27;s grandson during the Wars of the Roses.

In 1485, Henry Tudor, a female-line descendant of a legitimated branch of the royal house of Lancaster, the House of Beaufort, assumed the English crown as Henry VII, after defeating and killing Richard III in battle. Richard had been the last king of the House of York, and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Henry declared himself king retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before his victory over Richard at Bosworth Field. Sir William Blackstone called Henry&#x27;s hereditary claim &quot;the most remote and unaccountable that was ever set up,&quot; and said that his subsequent marriage to Richard&#x27;s niece Elizabeth of York, the daughter of Edward IV, was &quot;his best title to the crown.&quot; Henry caused Richard&#x27;s (Parliament&#x27;s recognition of his own claim) to be repealed and expunged from the Rolls of Parliament. After Henry&#x27;s coronation in London in October that year, his first parliament, summoned to meet at Westminster in November, enacted that &quot;the inheritance of the crown should be, rest, remain and abide in the most royal person of the then sovereign lord, King Henry VII, and the heirs of his body lawfully coming.&quot;

Henry VII was followed by his son, Henry VIII. Though his father descended from the Lancastrians, Henry VIII could also claim the throne through the Yorkist line, as his mother Elizabeth was the daughter of Edward IV. In 1542, Henry also assumed the title King of Ireland; this would pass down with the monarchs of England, and later Great Britain, until the separate crowns merged in 1800.

Henry VIII&#x27;s multiple marriages led to several complications over succession. Henry VIII was first married to Catherine of Aragon, by whom he had a daughter named Mary. His second marriage, to Anne Boleyn, resulted in a daughter named Elizabeth. Henry VIII had a son, Edward, by his third wife, Jane Seymour. The Succession to the Crown Act 1533 declared Mary illegitimate; the Second Act in 1536, did the same for Elizabeth. The Third Act in 1543 did not legitimize the daughters, but did reinsert them into the line of succession after Edward, providing further &quot;that the King should and might give, will, limit, assign, appoint or dispose the said imperial Crown and the other premises[...] by letters patent or last will in writing.&quot; Mary and Elizabeth, under Henry VIII&#x27;s will, were to be followed by the granddaughters of the King&#x27;s deceased sister Mary. Still excluded were Mary&#x27;s still-living daughters, Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk and Eleanor Clifford, Countess of Cumberland. This will also excluded from the succession the descendants of Henry&#x27;s sister Margaret, who were the rulers of Scotland.
Edward VI succeeded Henry VIII in 1547. Edward VI attempted to divert the course of succession in his will to prevent his Catholic half-sister, Mary, from inheriting the throne. He excluded both Mary and Elizabeth, settling on the Duchess of Suffolk&#x27;s daughter, Lady Jane Grey. Jane was also originally excluded on the premise that no woman could reign over England. Nonetheless, the will, which originally referred to Jane&#x27;s heirs-male, was amended to refer to Jane her heirs-male. Upon Edward VI&#x27;s death in 1553, Jane was proclaimed Queen of England and Ireland. She was not universally recognised and after nine days she was overthrown by the popular Mary. As Henry VIII&#x27;s will had been approved by the Succession to the Crown Act 1543, Edward&#x27;s contravening will was ignored as unlawful.

Mary I was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth I, who broke with the precedents of many of her predecessors, and refused to name an heir. Whilst previous monarchs (including Henry VIII) had specifically been granted authority to settle uncertain successions in their wills, the Treasons Act 1571 asserted that Parliament had the right to settle disputes, and made it treason to deny parliamentary authority. Wary of threats from other possible heirs, Parliament further passed the Safety of the Queen, etc. Act 1584, which provided that any individual involved in attempts to murder the sovereign would be disqualified from succeeding (the act was repealed in 1863).

=== Scotland ===

The House of Stewart (later Stuart) had ruled in Scotland since 1371. It followed strict rules of primogeniture. In 1503 King James IV married Margaret Tudor, a daughter of England&#x27;s Henry VII, which one hundred years later resulted in his great-grandson James VI inheriting the English Crown as well.

In 1543, Henry VIII had attempted to marry his son Edward to Mary, Queen of Scots, which would have drawn the kingdoms closer together. This marriage plan, outlined by the Treaty of Greenwich, was resisted by Scots who favoured the Auld Alliance with France. A nine year long war resulted, now known as the Rough Wooing. In July 1565, Mary, Queen of Scots, married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, a grandson of Margaret Tudor. Mary, Queen of Scots, was deposed in June 1567 and there was civil war in Scotland until May 1573. For the rest of the 16th century England&#x27;s diplomatic relations with Scotland were characterised by a so-called &quot;amity&quot;. Elizabeth I did not publicly name Mary&#x27;s son James VI as her successor, but gave him an annual cash subsidy.

=== After the union of the crowns ===
==== Stuarts ====
In 1603 Elizabeth I of England and Ireland was succeeded by King James VI of Scotland, her first cousin twice removed, even though his succession violated Henry VIII&#x27;s will, under which Lady Anne Stanley, heiress of Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, was supposed to succeed. James asserted that hereditary right was superior to statutory provision and, as King of Scotland, was powerful enough to deter any rival. He reigned as James I of England and Ireland, thus effecting the Union of the Crowns, although England and Scotland remained separate sovereign states until 1707. His succession was rapidly ratified by Parliament.

James&#x27;s eldest surviving son and successor, Charles I, was overthrown and beheaded in 1649 and the monarchy was abolished. A few years later, it was replaced by the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, a de facto monarch with the title of Lord Protector rather than King. Cromwell had the right to name his successor, which he exercised on his deathbed by choosing his son, Richard Cromwell. Richard was ineffective and was quickly forced from office. Shortly afterwards, the monarchy was restored, with Charles I&#x27;s son Charles II as King.
James II and VII, a Roman Catholic, followed his brother Charles II, despite efforts in the late 1670s to exclude him in favour of Charles&#x27;s illegitimate Protestant son, the Duke of Monmouth. James was deposed when his Protestant opponents forced him to flee from England in 1688. Parliament then deemed that James had, by fleeing the realms, abdicated the thrones and offered the Crowns not to the King&#x27;s infant son James but to his Protestant daughter Mary and to her husband William, who as James&#x27;s nephew was the first person in the succession not descended from him. The two became joint Sovereigns (a unique circumstance in British history) as William III of England and Ireland (and II of Scotland) and Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland. William had insisted on this unique provision as a condition of his military leadership against James.

The English Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Right Act, both passed in 1689, determined succession to the English, Scottish and Irish Thrones. First in the line were the descendants of Mary II. Next came Mary&#x27;s sister Princess Anne and her descendants. Finally, the descendants of William by any future marriage were added to the line of succession. Only Protestants were allowed to succeed; those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.

After Mary II died in 1694, her husband continued to reign alone until his own death in 1702. The line of succession provided for by the Bill of Rights was almost at an end; William and Mary had no children and Princess Anne&#x27;s children had died. Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701. The Act maintained the provision of the Bill of Rights whereby William would be succeeded by Princess Anne and her descendants, and thereafter by his own descendants from future marriages. The Act declared that they would be followed by James I and VI&#x27;s granddaughter Sophia, Electress Dowager of Hanover (the daughter of James&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth Stuart), and her heirs. As under the Bill of Rights, non-Protestants and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded. Because Sophia was a foreign citizen, Parliament passed the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705 to make her and her descendants English and therefore eligible for the throne.
Upon William&#x27;s death, Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. Because the Parliament of England settled on Sophia as Anne&#x27;s heir-presumptive without consulting Scottish leaders, the Estates of Scotland retaliated by passing the Scottish Act of Security 1704. The act provided that, upon the death of Anne, the Estates would meet to select an heir to the throne of Scotland, who could not be the same person as the English Sovereign unless numerous political and economic conditions were met. Anne originally withheld royal assent, but was forced to grant it when the estates refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the queen&#x27;s army. England&#x27;s Parliament responded by passing the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to cripple Scotland&#x27;s economy by cutting off trade with them. Thus, Scotland had little choice but to unite with England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707; the crown of the new nation (along with the crown of Ireland) was subject to the rules laid down by the English Act of Settlement.

==== Hanoverians and Windsors ====
Anne was predeceased by Sophia, Electress Dowager of Hanover, and was therefore succeeded by the latter&#x27;s son, who became George I in 1714.

Attempts were made in the risings of 1715 and 1745 to restore Stuart claimants to the Throne, supported by those who recognised the Jacobite succession. The House of Hanover nonetheless remained undeposed, and the Crown descended in accordance with the appointed rules. In 1801, following the Acts of Union 1800, the separate crowns of Great Britain and Ireland were merged and became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Between 1811 and 1820, when George III was deemed unfit to rule, the Prince of Wales (later George IV) acted as his regent. Some years later, the Regency Act 1830 made provision for a change in the line of succession had a child been born to William IV after his death, but this event did not come about.
On the death of William IV in 1837, his 18-year-old niece Victoria succeeded to the throne. After a 63-year reign, often known as the Victorian era, she was succeeded in 1901 by her eldest son Edward VII. On his death in 1910, his second son acceded to the throne as George V (Edward&#x27;s first son Prince Albert Victor died during an influenza pandemic in 1892).

Edward VIII became King on the death of his father, George V, in January 1936. Edward opened Parliament in November, but abdicated in December 1936, and was never crowned. Edward had desired to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorcee, but the Church of England, of which the British Sovereign is Supreme Governor, would not authorise the marriage of divorcees. Consequently, Parliament passed His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, by which Edward VIII ceased to be Sovereign &quot;immediately upon&quot; his royal assent as King being signified in Parliament on 11 December. The Act provided that he and his descendants, if any, were not to have any &quot;right, title or interest in or to the succession to the Throne&quot;. Edward died childless in 1972.

Edward&#x27;s abdication was &quot;a demise of the Crown&quot; (in the words of the Act), and the Duke of York, his brother who was then next in the line, immediately succeeded to the throne and to its &quot;rights, privileges, and dignities&quot;, taking the regnal name George VI. He in turn was succeeded in 1952 by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II. By that time, the monarch of the United Kingdom no longer reigned in the greater part of Ireland (which had become a republic in 1949), but was the monarch of a number of independent sovereign states (Commonwealth realms). She was then succeeded in 2022 by her eldest son, Charles III.

=== Commonwealth realms ===


By the terms of the Statute of Westminster 1931, each of the Commonwealth realms has the same person as monarch and, to maintain that arrangement, they have agreed to continue the same line of succession; some realms do so through domestic succession laws, while others stipulate whoever is monarch of the United Kingdom will also be monarch of that realm. In February 1952, on her accession, Elizabeth II was proclaimed as sovereign separately throughout her realms. In October 2011, the heads of government of all 16 realms agreed unanimously at a meeting held in Perth, Western Australia, to proposed changes to the royal succession laws that would see the order of succession for people born after 28 October 2011 governed by absolute primogeniture—wherein succession passes to an individual&#x27;s children according to birth order, regardless of sex—instead of male-preference primogeniture. They also agreed to lift a ban on those who marry Roman Catholics. The ban on Catholics themselves was retained to ensure that the monarch would be in communion with the Church of England. The changes came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, after legislation was made according to each realm&#x27;s constitution.

Following the changes coming into effect, the positions of the first 27 in line remained unchanged, including Princess Anne and her children and grandchildren, until the birth of Princess Charlotte of Cambridge on 2 May 2015. The first to be affected by the changes, on the day they came into effect on 26 March of that year, were the children of Lady Davina Windsor—her son Tane Mahuta Lewis (born 2012) and her daughter Senna Kowhai Lewis (born 2010)—who were reversed in the order of succession, becoming 29th and 28th in line respectively (now 36th and 35th ).

== Current rules ==
The Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement (restated by the Acts of Union) still govern succession to the throne. They were amended in the United Kingdom by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which was passed mainly &quot;to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender&quot; and &quot;to make provision about Royal Marriages&quot; (according to its long title), thereby implementing the Perth Agreement in the UK and in those realms that, by their laws, have as their monarch automatically whoever is monarch of the UK. Other realms passed their own legislation.

Anyone ineligible to succeed is treated as if they were dead. That person&#x27;s descendants are not also disqualified, unless they are personally ineligible.

=== Marriages ===
The Act of Settlement 1701 provides that Protestant &quot;heirs of the body&quot; (that is, legitimate descendants) of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, are eligible to succeed to the throne, unless otherwise disqualified. The meaning of &quot;heir of the body&quot; is determined by the common law rules of male preference primogeniture (the &quot;male-preference&quot; criterion is no longer applicable, in respect of succession to the throne, to persons born after 28 October 2011), whereby older children and their descendants inherit before younger children, and a male child takes precedence over a female sibling. Children born out of wedlock and adopted children are not eligible to succeed. Illegitimate children whose parents subsequently marry are legitimated, but remain ineligible to inherit.

The Royal Marriages Act 1772 (repealed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013) further required descendants of George II to obtain the consent of the reigning monarch to marry. (The requirement did not apply to descendants of princesses who married into foreign families, as well as, from 1936, any descendants of Edward VIII, of whom there are none.) The Act provided, however, that if a dynast older than 25 notified the Privy Council of their intention to marry without the consent of the Sovereign, then they may have lawfully done so after one year, unless both houses of Parliament expressly disapproved of the marriage. A marriage that contravened the Royal Marriages Act was void, and the resulting offspring illegitimate and thus ineligible to succeed, though the succession of the dynast who failed to obtain consent was not itself affected. This also had the consequence that marriage to a Roman Catholic without permission was void, so that the dynast was not disqualified from succeeding on account of being married to a Roman Catholic. Thus when the future George IV attempted to marry the Roman Catholic Maria Fitzherbert in 1785 without obtaining permission from George III he did not disqualify himself from inheriting the throne in due course. A marriage voided by the 1772 act prior to its repeal remains void &quot;for all purposes relating to the succession to the Crown&quot; under the 2013 act.

The constitutional crisis arising from Edward VIII&#x27;s decision to marry a divorcee in 1936 led to His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which provided that Edward VIII and his descendants would have no claim to the throne. The Act is no longer applicable, because Edward died in 1972 without issue.

Under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in line to the throne must obtain the sovereign&#x27;s approval before marrying. Marriage without the Sovereign&#x27;s consent disqualifies the person and the person&#x27;s descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown, but the marriage is still legally valid.

=== Religion ===
Rules relating to eligibility established by the Bill of Rights are retained under the Act of Settlement and the Acts of Union 1707. Under Article II of the Treaty of Union between England and Scotland (which was given legal force by the acts of the English and Scottish parliaments), the succession to the throne is limited to &quot;the Heirs of [Electress Sophia&#x27;s] body being Protestants.&quot; The Act of Settlement also states that &quot;whosoever shall hereafter come to the Possession of this Crown shall join in Communion with the Church of England&quot;. The definition of being &quot;in Communion with the Church of England&quot; has been interpreted broadly; for instance, King George I was Lutheran.

The Bill of Rights specifically excludes Roman Catholics from being sovereign, to the extent that they &quot;shall be excluded and be for ever uncapeable to inherit possesse or enjoy the Crowne&quot;, thus ignoring any potential conversion from Roman Catholicism to Protestantism. As such, a Roman Catholic is viewed as &quot;naturally dead&quot; for the purposes of succession. The Act of Settlement further provided that anyone who married a Roman Catholic was ineligible to succeed. The Act did not require that the spouse be Anglican; it only barred those who married Roman Catholics. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed the ban on individuals who marry Roman Catholics, though not on Roman Catholics themselves, because the monarch is Supreme Governor of the Church of England.

=== Treason ===
Under the Treason Act 1702 and the Treason (Ireland) Act 1703, it is treason to &quot;endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown[...] from succeeding[...] to the imperial crown of this realm&quot;. Since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the maximum penalty has been life imprisonment.

== Accession ==
In the Commonwealth realms, upon the death of a sovereign, the heir apparent or heir presumptive succeeds to the throne immediately, with no need for confirmation or further ceremony. Nevertheless, the Accession Council meets and decides upon the making of the accession proclamation, which by custom has for centuries been ceremonially proclaimed in public places, in London, York, Edinburgh and other cities. The anniversary is observed throughout the sovereign&#x27;s reign as Accession Day, including royal gun salutes in the United Kingdom.

Formerly, a new sovereign proclaimed their own accession; however, on the death of Elizabeth I, an Accession Council met to proclaim the accession of James I to the throne of England. James was then in Scotland and reigning as King James VI of Scotland. This precedent has been followed since. Now, the Accession Council normally meets in St James&#x27;s Palace. Proclamations since James I&#x27;s have usually been made in the name of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Privy Council, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and citizens of the City of London and &quot;other principal Gentlemen of quality&quot;, though there have been variations in some proclamations. The proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II was the first to make mention of representatives of members of the Commonwealth.

Upon their accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the sovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism. This declaration, known as the Accession Declaration, is required to be taken either at the first meeting of parliament of their reign (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at their coronation, whichever occurs first. The wording of the declaration was changed in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be overly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman Catholicism, the sovereign now declares themselves to be a Protestant and that they will &quot;uphold and maintain&quot; the Protestant succession. In addition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the Acts of Union 1707 to make an oath to &quot;maintain and preserve&quot; the Church of Scotland. This oath is normally made at the sovereign&#x27;s first meeting of the Privy Council following their accession. According to the Regency Act 1937, should the sovereign be under the age of 18, such oaths and declarations required to be taken by the sovereign shall be made upon attainment of that age.

After a period of mourning, the new sovereign is usually consecrated and crowned in Westminster Abbey. Normally, the Archbishop of Canterbury officiates, though the sovereign may designate any other bishop of the Church of England. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, Edward VIII was never crowned, yet during his short reign was the undoubted king.

== Regency Act 1937 ==

In the event that the sovereign is under 18, or is incapacitated, the first person in the line of succession who is over the age of 21 (or 18 in the case of the heir apparent) and is domiciled in the United Kingdom becomes regent, and exercises the powers of the sovereign.

The first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21 (or 18 in the case of the heir), and the sovereign&#x27;s consort, may be appointed counsellors of state. Counsellors of state perform some of the sovereign&#x27;s duties in the United Kingdom while the sovereign is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated.

Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles.

Princess Anne and Prince Edward were added as extra counsellors of state in 2022 by an act of Parliament, following the death of Elizabeth II.

<text>Thom McKee (born 1955) is a retired officer in the United States Navy and 1977 graduate from the United States Naval Academy. He is best known for being a contestant on the game show &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot;, becoming the show&#x27;s longest reigning champion and (at the time) the highest money winner in American game show history. 

==Performance on &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot;==
As a contestant on &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot;, McKee won $312,700 (the equivalent of about $ in today&#x27;s dollars) in cash and prizes over 46 days on the show. He played a total of 89 games, defeating 43 opponents (the remaining games other than his last being drawn), and answered 353 questions correctly. His total prizes included eight cars (as winners on &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot; were awarded a new car every fifth win), three sailboats, 16 vacations (which he was unable to take), several other smaller prizes, and $200,000 in cash. Prior to McKee&#x27;s record, the most ever won on a television game show was &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; contestant Eileen Jason, who won $305,280 ($250,000 of which was won during the 1979 Tournament of Champions).

McKee was defeated on August 3, 1980 by Erik Kraepelien to end his winning streak. Three years after his original run on &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot;, McKee made one more appearance on the show, this time to compete in a Tournament of Champions. 

===Records broken===
The wins and consecutive days records were broken by &quot;100%&quot; contestant Ian Lygo in 1998, while the winnings record was broken by Michael Shutterly during the original 15-night run of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; in 1999, where he won $500,000. McKee still holds the American record for most consecutive games played (100 games, 56 wins), due to the nature of &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot; making ties possible (and frequent). However, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; contestant Ken Jennings (who himself set a new cash winnings record), beat the wins record with 74, and most consecutive days with 75 in 2004–05.

==Later life==
In the 1990s, he became president of Hicks &amp; Rotner Associates Inc. (now H&amp;R Retail), a brokerage firm. He later moved to Maryland and became a realtor. 

When Ken Jennings made news for his record-breaking run on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 2004, McKee wrote to him to congratulate him. Jennings responded by telling McKee that he had been one of his inspirations as a trivia fan, having watched his original championship run as a child.

===Other game show appearances===

Shortly after his reign on &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot; ended in 1980, McKee was invited to appear on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; as a subject. He fooled three of the four panelists, with Nipsey Russell being the only one who correctly identified him. 

Later, in 2008, McKee was invited to participate in &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, an American super tournament featuring sixteen former game show contestants competing for a $100,000 cash prize. The contestants were seeded by their total winnings, with McKee drawing the #11 seed in the tournament. This matched him up with John Carpenter, who was the first contestant to win the top prize on the American version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in 1998; McKee was defeated by Carpenter and did not advance in the tournament.

<text>A landing helicopter dock (LHD) is a multipurpose amphibious assault ship that is capable of operating as a helicopter carrier and also has a well deck for supporting landing crafts. LHD vessels are built with a full flight deck similar in appearance to a light aircraft carrier to operate VTOL rotorcrafts such as utility and attack helicopters, and can also support tiltrotor aircraft (such as the MV-22 Osprey) and VSTOL fixed-wing aircraft (such as the AV-8 Harrier and the F-35B Lightning II). Some future designs might even support CATOBAR operations for light aircraft and UCAVs via aircraft catapults and arresting gears.

The United States Navy (USN) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) use the term as a specific hull classification symbol. Examples of this kind of ship include the USN&#x27;s , French Navy&#x27;s and ships of the Spanish Navy&#x27;s &quot;Juan Carlos I&quot; class including those designs based on the class, such as the RAN&#x27;s . Other nations also use the designation for their vessels, such as the Republic of Korea Navy for its . The Type 075 and Type 076 classes of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), though only regarded as amphibious assault ships in their native China, are considered LHDs in NATO reporting names.

The landing helicopter assault (LHA) is a similar USN hull classification with two classes that both precede and follow the ships classed LHD. Most LHAs also have well decks of a comparable size to LHDs, with the exception of the first two ships (LHA-6 and LHA-7), which lack the well deck entirely to make room for larger hangars. However, LHA-8 will feature a well deck, returning the terms to their more interchangeable state.

<doc id="880001" wikidata="Q1967582" url="?curid=880001" title="Pangkor Treaty of 1874">
<text>The Pangkor Treaty of 1874 was a treaty signed between Great Britain and the Sultan of Perak on 20 January 1874, on the Colonial Steamer &quot;Pluto&quot;, off the coast of Perak. The treaty is significant in the history of the Malay states as it legitimised British control of the Malay rulers and paved the way for British imperialism in Malaya. It was the result of a multi-day conference organised by Andrew Clarke, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, to solve two problems: the Larut War, and Sultanship in Perak.

== Precedence ==

Perak was a major tin producer throughout the 19th century, leading Britain, which had already colonised Penang, Malacca and Singapore, to consider Perak of significant importance. However, local strife, collectively known as the Larut Wars (1861–1874), between the local Malay elites and frequent clashes between Chinese secret societies disrupted the supply of tin from the mines of Perak.

In 1871, Sultan Ali of Perak died. However, Raja Abdullah, the heir apparent, had not been present at his funeral. Raja Bendahara Sultan Ismail was proclaimed Sultan of Perak instead. At the same time, two Chinese secret societies, Ghee Hin (led by Chin Ah Yam) and Hai San (led by Chung Keng Quee), fought against each other over control of the tin mines.

Raja Muda Abdullah later appealed to the British regarding these two problems. He turned to Tan Kim Cheng, his friend in Singapore who was a well-known businessman. Tan, together with an English merchant in Singapore, drafted a letter to Governor Sir Andrew Clarke which Abdullah signed. The letter expressed Abdullah&#x27;s desire to place Perak under British protection, and &quot;to have a man of sufficient abilities to show (him) a good system of government.&quot; Chung Keng Quee had already on 26 September 1872, signed by himself and 44 other Chinese leaders, seeking British interference following the attack of 12,000 men of Chung Shan by 2,000 men of Sen Ning. The British immediately saw this as an opportunity to expand its influence in Southeast Asia and to strengthen its monopoly on tin exports. As a result, the Pangkor Treaty of 1874 was signed.

The Malay translation of the treaty was prepared by Frank Swettenham and Mohamed Said, the munshi for the Straits Settlements.

== Summary of the conference ==

The Chinese chiefs arrived on 13 January, the Hai San group was accompanied by Swettenham, while the Ghee Hins group was escorted by Pickering. Mantri Ngah Ibrahim arrived the next day, escorted by his lawyer R. C. Woods and his security chief T. C. Speedy. Raja Muda Abdullah and the Malay chiefs arrived on 15 January. The afternoon session (circa 3:30 p.m.) on 16 January was a one-to-one meeting between Mantri Ngah Ibrahim and Clarke, in which Clarke highlighted to the Mantri that the problem in Larut was a direct consequence of his vacillating policy. The second day of the conference (17 January) was the meeting between Clarke and the Malay chiefs, whose opinions were individually considered before the candidate for the sultanship was decided. 18 January was a Saturday and no business was conducted. On 19 January the draft treaty was discussed with the Malay chiefs. The Treaty of Pangkor was officially sealed in the afternoon session of the concluding day (actually in the morning session of 20 January, another agreement between Clarke and the Chinese chiefs was signed, i.e. Bond of $50,000 to Keep the Peace).

== Agreement ==

=== Terms and conditions ===

The agreement dictated:

* That the Raja Muda Abdullah be recognised as the Sultan of Perak.
* That the Raja Bandahara Ismail, now acting sultan, be allowed to retain the title of Sultan Muda with a pension and a certain small territory assigned to him.
* That all the other nominations of great Officers made at the time the Rajah Bandahara Ismail received the regalia be confirmed.
* That the power given to the Orang Kayah Mantri over Larut by the late Sultan be confirmed.
* That all revenues be collected and all appointments made in the name of the Sultan.
* That the Sultan receive and provide a suitable residence for a British Officer to be called Resident, who shall be accredited to his Court, and whose advice must be asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching Malay religion and custom.
* That the Governor of Larut shall have attached to him as Assistant Resident, a British Officer acting under the Resident of Perak, with similar power and subordinate only to the said Resident.
* That the cost of these Residents with their establishments be determined by the Government of the Straits Settlements and be a first charge on the Revenues of Perak.
* That a Civil List regulating the income to be received by the Sultan, by the Bandahara, by the Mantri, and by the other Officers be the next charge on the said Revenue.
* That the collection and control of all revenue and the general administration of the country be regulated under the advice of these Residents.
* That the Treaty under which the Pulo Dinding and the islands of Pangkor were ceded to Great Britain having been misunderstood and it being desirable to readjust the same, so as to carry into effect the intention of the Framers thereof, it is hereby declared that the Boundaries of the said Territory so ceded shall be rectified as follows, that is to say: from Bukit Sigari, as laid down in the Chart Sheet No. 1 Straits of Malacca, a tracing of which is annexed, marked A, in a straight line to the sea, thence along the sea coast to the South, to Pulo Katta on the West, and from Pulo Katta a line running North East about five miles, and thence North to Bukit Sigari.
* That the Southern watershed of the Krean River, that is to say, the portion of land draining into that river from the south be declared British Territory, as a rectification of the Southern Boundary of Province Wellesley. Such Boundary to be marked out by commissioners; one named by the Government of the Straits Settlements, and the other by the Sultan of Perak.
* That on the cessation of the present disturbances in Perak and the re-establishment of peace and amity among the contending factions in that country, immediate measures under the control and supervision of one or more British Officers shall be taken for restoring as far as practicable the occupation of the mines, and the possession of machinery, &amp;c., as held previous to the commencement of these disturbances, and for the payment of compensation for damages, the decision of such officers shall be final in such case.
* The Mantri of Larut engages to acknowledge as a debt due by him to the Government of the Straits Settlements, the charges and expenses incurred by this investigation, as well as charges and expenses to which the Colony of the Straits Settlements and Great Britain have been put or may be put by their efforts to secure the tranquility of Perak and the safety of trade.

== Result ==
Raja Ismail did not attend the meeting arranged between Sir Andrew Clarke and Raja Abdullah. He did not recognise the agreement but had no choice as he was faced with the alliance between Raja Abdullah and the British. As a result, Raja Abdullah was made sultan, and Sir James W. W. Birch was appointed as Perak&#x27;s first British Resident after the treaty came into force.

Following this, the British actively became involved in three other Malay states: Negeri Sembilan, Selangor and Pahang. These states, along with Perak, were later reorganised into the Federated Malay States.

Clarke arrived in November 1873 and he put Perak, Selangor and Sungei Ujong under British protection within a year, and Pahang in 1888. In 1875, a British Resident was sent to Selangor. In 1874, a British Resident was sent to Sungei Ujong.

<doc id="880023" wikidata="Q1277973" url="?curid=880023" title="George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes">
<text>George Francis &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes (7 May 1885 – 9 February 1969) was an American actor. He began as something of a leading man and a character player, but he was best known for his numerous appearances in B-Western film series as the bewhiskered, cantankerous, but ever-loyal and brave comic sidekick of the cowboy stars William Boyd, Roy Rogers and John Wayne.

==Early years==
Hayes was born the third of seven children in his father&#x27;s hotel, the Hayes Hotel, in Stannards, New York. (Hayes always gave Wellsville as his birthplace, but legally he was born in Stannards.) He was the son of Elizabeth Morrison and Clark Hayes. In addition to operating the hotel, his father was also involved in petroleum production, an industry which began in that part of the country. His siblings included his brothers, William W., Morrison, and Clark B., and his sisters, Nellie Elizabeth Hayes Ebeling and Harriet &quot;Hattie&quot; Elizabeth Hayes Allen. Morrison Hayes, a corporal in the United States Army, was killed in action on July 19, 1918, during World War I in France and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the war. The American Legion post in Wellsville, New York is named after him. George’s uncle on his mother&#x27;s side was George F. Morrison, vice president of General Electric.

Hayes grew up in Stannards and attended Stannards School. He played semi-professional baseball while in high school. At 17 he ran away from home, joined a stock company, apparently traveled for a time with a circus, and became a successful vaudevillian. He often appeared in comic sketches as &quot;The Rube Constable.&quot;

Hayes married Olive E. Ireland, the daughter of a glass finisher, on March 4, 1914. She joined him in vaudeville, performing under the name Dorothy Earle (not to be confused with film actress and writer Dorothy Earle). Hayes had become so successful that by 1928, at age 43, he was able to retire to a home on Long Island in Baldwin, New York. He lost all his savings the next year in the 1929 stock market crash. Olive persuaded her husband to try his luck in films, and the couple moved to Los Angeles. They remained together until her death on July 5, 1957. They had no children.

==Film career==


After his move to Los Angeles, according to later interviews, Hayes had a chance meeting with the producer Trem Carr, who liked his look and gave him 30 roles over the next six years. In his early career, Hayes was cast in a variety of parts, including villains, and occasionally played two roles in a single film. He found a niche in the growing genre of Western films, many of which were series with recurring characters. Hayes did not come from a cowboy background; he did not know how to ride a horse until he was in his 40s.

Hayes, in real life an intelligent, well-groomed and articulate man, often was cast as a grizzled codger who uttered phrases such as &quot;consarn it&quot;, &quot;yer durn tootin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;dadgummit&quot;, &quot;durn persnickety female&quot;, and &quot;young whippersnapper&quot;. From 1935 to 1939, Hayes played the part of Windy Halliday, the humorous &quot;codger&quot; sidekick of Hopalong Cassidy (played by William Boyd). In 1939, Hayes left this role at Paramount Pictures after a dispute over his salary and moved to Republic Pictures. Paramount held the rights to the name Windy Halliday, and Republic renamed him Gabby Whitaker, which was virtually the same character. As Gabby, he appeared in more than 40 films from 1939 to 1946, usually with Roy Rogers (44 times) and with Gene Autry (7) and Wild Bill Elliott (14), often working under the directorship of Joseph Kane (34). Hayes repeatedly was cast as a sidekick of the Western stars Randolph Scott (6 times) and John Wayne (15 times, some as straight or villainous characters). Hayes played Wayne&#x27;s sidekick in Raoul Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Dark Command&quot; (1940), which featured Roy Rogers in a supporting role.

Hayes became a popular performer and consistently ranked among the 10 favorite actors in polls taken of moviegoers of the period. He appeared in either one or both the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; and &quot;Boxoffice Magazine&quot; lists of the Top Ten Moneymaking Western Stars for 12 consecutive years and then a thirteenth time in 1954, four years after his last film.

Westerns declined in popularity in the late 1940s, and Hayes made his last film in the genre in 1950: &quot;The Cariboo Trail&quot;. He had appeared in 174 westerns. He moved to television and hosted &quot;The Gabby Hayes Show&quot;, a Western series, from 1950 to 1954 on NBC and in a version in 1956 on ABC. The show was sponsored by Quaker Oats, and its products were advertised during the show. In promoting the product, Gabby said to stand back from the screen, and he fired a cannon loaded with cereal at the screen as a tie-in to their ad slogan, &quot;shot from guns&quot;. He introduced the show, often while whittling on a piece of wood, and sometimes told a tall tale. When the series ended, Hayes retired from show business. During this time, he made guest appearances on television, including several on &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; for his friend &quot;Buffalo&quot; Bob Smith. He lent his name to &quot;Gabby Hayes Western&quot; comics, published by Fawcett Publications from November 1948 until January 1957, and to a children&#x27;s summer camp in New York.

==Death==

Following his wife&#x27;s death on July 5, 1957, Hayes first lived at his ranch on Toluca Lake in California. He later stayed at a 10-unit apartment building he owned.

Early in 1969 he entered Saint Joseph Hospital in Burbank, California, for treatment of cardiovascular disease. Hayes died there on February 9, 1969, at the age of 83. He is interred in the Forest Lawn–Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

==Honors==
Two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame commemorate Hayes&#x27;s work in the entertainment industry: one for his contribution to radio at 6427 Hollywood Boulevard and one for his contribution to television at 1724 Vine Street. In 2000, he was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

==Popular culture==

Homage was paid to Hayes in a different way in the 1974 satirical Western &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. The actor and director Jack Starrett, credited as Claude Ennis Starrett Jr., played a Hayes-like character. In keeping with a running joke in the movie, the character is called Gabby Johnson. After Johnson delivers a rousing, though partially unintelligible speech to the townspeople, David Huddleston&#x27;s character stands up to say, &quot;Now, who can argue with &quot;that&quot;?!&quot;, and proclaims it &quot;authentic frontier gibberish&quot;.

In the animated film &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, the character Stinky Pete the Prospector, voiced by Kelsey Grammer, is modeled after Hayes. In the film&#x27;s fictional universe, he is a toy version of a character on the marionette television western &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot;, where he is a colorful comic relief character. In contrast, the toy is intelligent and well-spoken, a reference to Hayes&#x27;s contrasting real-life and film personas.

Into a Mighty Carson Art Players sketch on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Johnny Carson impersonated Gabby Hayes in a sketch with Roy Rogers. This sketch has appeared on Carson&#x27;s syndicated series &quot;Carson&#x27;s Comedy Classics&quot;, which features highlights from his years as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

Every year in early July, from 1983 through 1989, Gabby Hayes Days were celebrated in Wellsville, New York. The event featured a street sale, square dancing, and Hayes look-alike contests for adults and children. This celebration was eventually merged in the mid-July Wellsville Balloon Rally and gradually disappeared. A street is also named after him in Wellsville, Gabby Hayes Lane.

Since April 1969, a band of fishermen has traveled to Kettle Creek, Pennsylvania] for the Gabby Hayes Memorial Trout Fishing Tournament. These men, known as Gabby Guys, gather annually to celebrate the opening day of the trout fishing season and the memory of Hayes. In April 2019, they celebrated their fiftieth anniversary, which also marked 50 years since Hayes&#x27; passing.

<doc id="880034" wikidata="Q1652189" url="?curid=880034" title="Philip I, Metropolitan of Moscow">
<text>Philip I (; died 1473) was Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, from 1464 to 1473. He was the third metropolitan in Moscow to be appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as had been the norm.

== Biography ==
According to Archimandrite Macarius (Veretennikov), he was born in the Byzantine Empire at the beginning of the 15th century. He served as a patriarchal clerk-official and lived in Constantinople. During his tonsure, he was named after the Philip the Apostle.

He arrived to Russia apparently after the death of Metropolitan Photius, after 1431. He stayed in Russia for a long time, became Russified, and the memory of his Greek origin was almost lost.

In 1464, he was appointed Metropolitan of Moscow, hand-picked by Theodosius at the time of his resignation, just as Theodosius had been picked by his predecessor, Iona

In the 1470s, Philip was actively engaged in a struggle against the Polish–Lithuanian influence over Novgorod, particularly the influence of the Metropolitan of Lithuania and the fear that Novgorod would defect to him and eventually go over to Catholicism.

While he was instrumental in bringing Sophia Paleologue from Rome to Moscow in 1472, Philip was against admitting a papal legate in her entourage into Moscow, thus continuing his opposition to Catholicism or &quot;Latinism&quot; in his province.
That same year, Philip started reconstructing the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin. The original cathedral, built by Metropolitan Petr in 1326, was in a dilapidated state; Philipp hired inexperienced workers and soon after his death the building collapsed. It was rebuilt by Aristotile Fioravanti under Metropolitan Gerontius.

Metropolitan Philip died on 5 April 1473 and was buried in the Cathedral of the Dorimition in the Moscow Kremlin.

<text>This article lists the extreme points of New Zealand – the places that lie farther north, south, east or west than any other location in New Zealand.

State Highway 1 runs throughout the two main islands from Cape Reinga in the north to Bluff in the south. Cape Reinga is sometimes popularly thought to be the northernmost point of the North Island, but North Cape is further north, with Cape Reinga the northwesternmost point. Similarly, Bluff is sometimes thought to be the southernmost point of the South Island, but Slope Point in the Catlins is slightly further south than the Bluff (the promontory that gives the town its name).

<text>San Sebastiano al Vesuvio () is a (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Naples, located on the western slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Its elevation means that it is often a few degrees cooler than the neighbouring metropolis of Naples.

In 1944 it was destroyed and two children were killed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius during the Allies&#x27; occupation of southern Italy, but has since been rebuilt. The main attraction is the church of &quot;San Sebastiano Martire&quot; from the 16th century. 

Gaetano Filangieri, a Neapolitan jurist, was born in San Sebastiano al Vesuvius. He had an extensive correspondence with Benjamin Franklin.

<text>Kurt Martti Wallenius (25 July 1893 in Kuopio – 3 May 1984 in Helsinki) was a Finnish Major General.

==Jäger Movement==
Wallenius was a member of the Finnish Jäger troops trained in Germany prior to Finnish independence. In 1915, Wallenius travelled to Germany where he enrolled in the Royal Prussian 27th Jäger Battalion. He took part in the battles on the Misa River. 
==Civil War==
After returning to Finland, Wallenius took part in the Finnish Civil War of 1918 on the side of the anti-Communist Whites. He commanded a platoon in Tervola and Tornio. In Lapland, Wallenius met reindeer herder Aleksi Hihnavaara, with whom he travelled around Lapland, and the two became good friends. Wallenius was later appointed commander of the troops around Kuolajärvi and Kuusamo. Here, he was given the command of the northern group in the failed March 1918 Viena expedition, which tried to annex parts of East Karelia to Finland. He was also the leader of the second Petsamo Expedition in May 1920.

In February 1918, Wallenius presided over the executions of five Russians, including a diplomat.

==Regimental Commander==
After the Civil War Wallenius commanded troops in North-Western Finland: the Salla Regiment and the 1st Border Guard Regiment of Lapland. In the 1920s, he was briefly made a military attaché in Berlin. 
==Lapua Movement==
In 1930, Wallenius was promoted to the rank of Major General. However, he was forced to retire in that year when he was implicated in the kidnapping of Kaarlo Ståhlberg who served as the first Finnish President. Wallenius spent eight months in pretrial custody and initially received a 3-year sentence, albeit his conviction was later overturned on appeal. In the 1930s, Wallenius became involved in right-wing activities, becoming the secretary-general of the Lapua movement. In this capacity, he was involved in the so-called Mäntsälä rebellion. Wallenius was imprisoned for just over one year for aiding and abetting high treason.

==Winter War==
In the Winter War, Wallenius commanded Finnish troops in Lapland. When the Winter War began, the Commander-in-Chief of Finnish troops Mannerheim appointed Wallenius as the commander of the Lapland Group. The troops under his command, though outnumbered, repulsed Soviet troops at Salla and Petsamo. Once the front in Lapland had stabilized, Wallenius handed the command over to Swedish volunteers under Lieutenant General Ernst Linder in February 1940. Wallenius and most of his troops were sent to the southernmost point of the front to western shore of the Bay of Viipuri, where the Red Army had crossed the frozen gulf. Wallenius protested this new assignment, thinking he was being punished for his past sins. The situation was critical and terrain totally different from what Wallenius and his men were used to. Wallenius failed to prevent the Red Army from gaining a foothold from the western shore of the bay, and there were reports that he was drinking heavily. Wallenius was dishonorably discharged in early March 1940, after only three days in command, and replaced by Lieutenant General Karl Lennart Oesch. Wallenius was removed from the Defence Forces officer lists. 
==Retirement==
Once the Continuation War began in June 1941, Wallenius failed to get a command. He lived in retirement in Rovaniemen maalaiskunta writing books and articles.

<doc id="880044" wikidata="Q143246" url="?curid=880044" title="King William Island">
<text>King William Island (; previously: King William Land; ) is an island in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, which is part of the Arctic Archipelago. In area it is between and making it the 61st-largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s 15th-largest island. Its population, as of the 2021 census, was 1,349, all of whom live in the island&#x27;s only community, Gjoa Haven.

While searching for the Northwest Passage, a number of polar explorers visited, or spent their winters on, King William Island.

==Geography==

The island is separated from the Boothia Peninsula by the James Ross Strait to the northeast, and the Rae Strait to the east. To the west is the Victoria Strait and beyond it Victoria Island. Within the Simpson Strait, to the south of the island, is Todd Island, and beyond it, further to the south, is the Adelaide Peninsula. Queen Maud Gulf lies to the southwest.

Some places on the coast are: (counter clockwise from the northern tip) Cape Felix, Victory Point and Gore Point at the mouth of Collinson Inlet, Point Le Vesconte, Erebus Bay, Cape Crozier, (south side) Terror Bay, Irving Islands, Washington Bay, Cape Herschel, Gladman Point, entrance to Simpson Strait, Todd Islets, (east side) Gjoa Haven, Matheson Peninsula, Latrobe Bay, Cape Norton at mouth of Peel Inlet, Matty Island, Tennent Islands, Clarence Islands, Cape Felix.

==Wildlife==
The island is known for its large populations of barren-ground caribou, which summer there before migrating in the autumn by walking south over the sea ice.

==Role in Arctic exploration==

===Sir James Clark Ross===
The island was long occupied by Inuit, who had a culture adapted to the extreme environment. In 1830, the British explorer James Clark Ross named it &quot;King William Land&quot; for King William IV the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; Ross thought at the time that it was a peninsula. Some sources credit his uncle, John Ross with naming the land. In 1834, George Back, another Arctic explorer, viewed its south shore from Chantrey Inlet and eventually recognised it as an island.

===Sir John Franklin===

Sir John Franklin, another British explorer, made an Arctic expedition looking for the Northwest Passage about a decade after Ross; his two ships became stranded in 1846 when frozen in the sea ice northwest of the island. After abandoning the two ships, most of the crew died from exposure and starvation as they attempted to walk south near the western coastline. Two of Franklin&#x27;s men were buried at Hall Point on the island&#x27;s south coast. The ships were believed lost forever, as many subsequent expeditions were unable to find them.

It was not until June 29, 1981, that researchers finally had luck. A team led by Canadian archaeologist Owen Beattie, found 31 pieces of human bone fragments on the southern tip of the island, called Booth Point.

On September 9, 2014, Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the Victoria Strait Expedition had located one of Franklin&#x27;s two ships beneath shallow waters south of King William Island. It is preserved in very good condition; the side-scan sonar could detect the deck planking. By the beginning of October, the wreck had been identified as HMS &quot;Erebus&quot;. The other expedition vessel, HMS &quot;Terror&quot;, was found in 2016 in Terror Bay, off the south-west coast of King William Island.

===Roald Amundsen===

In 1903, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, looking for the Northwest Passage, sailed through the James Ross Strait and stopped at a natural harbour on the island&#x27;s south coast. Unable to proceed due to sea ice, he spent the winters of 1903–1904 and 1904–1905 there. During his stays, he learned Arctic living skills from the local Netsilik. He used his ship &quot;Gjøa&quot; as a base for explorations in the summer of 1904, during which he travelled by dogsled on the Boothia Peninsula and to the North Magnetic Pole. After 22 months on the island, Amundsen left in August 1905. The harbour where he lived has the island&#x27;s only settlement, Gjoa Haven. Amundsen used skills learned from the Inuit when he made his later expedition to the South Pole.

===George Porter===
George Porter was born on a whaling ship near Herschel Island in 1895 to Mary Kappak and W.P.S. Porter. George was schooled in Alaska. In 1913 he was a sailor on the &quot;Elvira&quot; and travelled with the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson. After briefly working as a reindeer herder in Siberia, he enlisted with the US military near the end of the First World War. In 1919, George was discharged from the Army in Iowa. In 1921 George sailed to Australia. Later George guided Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) commander Henry Larsen on many trips. George Porter eventually made Gjoa Haven on King William Island his home, where he worked as the manager of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post for a career of 25 years.

== Climate ==
Like many places in the high Arctic the island has a tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;), its winter is long and cold and the summers are cool, melting part of the ice; with low precipitation, it is a &quot;cold desert&quot;.
