<doc id="892756" wikidata="Q3493144" url="?curid=892756" title="Barret Wallace">
<text>is a character in Square Enix&#x27;s role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. He was created by character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and has since appeared in the CGI film sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot; as well as other games and media in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; series. As of &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Barret is voiced by Masahiro Kobayashi and Masato Funaki in Japanese, while Beau Billingslea and John Eric Bentley voice him in English.

Barret is first introduced in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as an eco-terrorist, leading the group AVALANCHE to bomb Mako reactors in Midgar as to avenge the losses dealt him by the megacorporation Shinra Electric Power Company, the Planet&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; world government, who operate under the pretense of saving the Planet. Over the course of the story, Barret re-examines his efforts and focuses on pursuing the villain Sephiroth in an effort to protect the planet and the future of his adopted daughter, Marlene. Elements of the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; would later expand upon his character, detailing the character&#x27;s history before and after the events of the original game.

The first black playable character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Barret&#x27;s appearance and sometimes profane speech has been compared to that of Mr. T. He is also considered to be the first true father figure in the series, for his relationship with his adoptive daughter Marlene. His character arc is also considered a deconstruction of a revenge story, as a former coal miner seeking vengeance through eco-terrorism before eventually realizing revenge is not the right motivation. The character has earned praise, but also criticism and accusations of racism by some.

==Conception and design==
Barret was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and was present in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; from its early development. Initially the game was to only have three characters: Barret, the protagonist Cloud Strife, and the heroine Aerith Gainsborough. During a phone call to project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die. After much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith, as they felt Barret&#x27;s death would be &quot;too obvious&quot;.

Originally called Blow in the early planning stages of the game, Barret&#x27;s name is based on the Japanese transliteration of the English word &quot;bullet&quot;, and he was developed with the &quot;Gunner&quot; character class in mind. During an early demonstration of the game, Nomura felt his original design made Barret appear too short, and revised it. He stands at tall, and is the first black playable character in the series. He has a high and tight haircut and full beard, and wears an earring in his left ear. His attire consists of a jacket with torn sleeves, dark green pants, boots, a fingerless glove on his left hand, and metal bands surrounding his abdomen and left wrist. Nomura wanted to give each character in the game a striking feature on their character design, and in Barret&#x27;s case it was the scars on his cheek.

Barret was a concept Nomura had wanted to introduce since the beginning of the game&#x27;s development, a character with an arm replaced with a weapon. His right hand is replaced with a prosthetic gatling gun called a &quot;Gimmick Arm&quot;, which he refers to as his &quot;partner&quot; in-game. When they were still planning out the technological aspects of the game&#x27;s world however, early designs of his character had a bowgun on his arm instead. He was originally planned to have a medallion around his neck, but this was later changed to a set of dog tags.

===Post-&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===

When developing &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Nomura stated that because of the comparisons between Barret&#x27;s original design and Mr. T, they decided to take it in a different direction for the film, implementing co-director Takeshi Nozue&#x27;s suggestion to give him cornrows for his hair, while Nomura designed his face. Artist Yusuke Naora also influenced the design, developing his attire, which originally consisted of white overalls, before instead having him wear him a down vest. Other aspects of his design included the removal of the metal bands around his body, a white sleeve extending from the middle of his right forearm to his elbow which is fastened by straps, a black band on his left forearm surrounded by a pink string and bow, and a fishnet shirt that ends in torn fibers below his waist. The dog tags were altered to a bullet and medallion supported by a chain around his neck, and three rings covered his left hand. His Gimmick Arm was modified into a robotic prosthetic hand, developed by Nomura, with the only guideline being &quot;a huge, over-the-top gun that transforms in a huge, over-the-top way&quot;. Nozue stated that these specifics made it difficult to work with, and decided to conceal the hand&#x27;s transformation sequence into the gun as much as possible. Barret&#x27;s arm tattoo was changed as well, but retained the &quot;skull and fire&quot; motif of the original. It was redesigned by Brazilian tattoo artist and fashion designer Jun Matsui, featuring a stylized black skull surrounded by flames, meant to give a strong impression of &quot;masculinity and power&quot;. While the skull was done in black, the flames were in red to represent his &quot;hot-headed personality&quot;, and utilized a tribal pattern as they had become popular in Japan at the time to represent vitality.

For &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, Square wanted to show Barret as a mature person, contrasting him with the younger Cloud when interacting with others. While they originally planned to use his &quot;Advent Children&quot; design, the staff later decided to give every party member a new look. The team noted that his design was the one most significantly changed from the original game, but tried to keep aspects of his original design in mind to give him a strong and stalwart appearance. Main character modeler Dan Suzuki commented that they went through several drafts on Barret&#x27;s face before modeling him. Barret&#x27;s shoulders and the back of his neck were also changed halfway through development to help &quot;bring out his dependable, fatherly nature&quot;. His gun arm also went through significant changes, adding a motor and mapping out the internals to invoke a sense of realism, but also the mental image of Barret being able to disassemble and maintenance the weapon after missions. His melee weapons were designed to reflect his &quot;blunt, no-nonsense personality&quot;. In the English dub of &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, John Eric Bentley voiced Barret. During localization, Bentley did not know the exact media in which he would portray Barret, but figured it had to do with the remake. Bentley researched in order to portray Barret properly, and was aided by the translators for the Japanese version, who gave him the context of the scenes he had to record. For him, one of the biggest challenges in his work was &quot;representation&quot;, and claimed that Barret was more than a one-dimensional character. In regards to the story&#x27;s mission to destroy the Mako Reactor 5, Square aimed to show Barret as a fitting leader for AVALANCHE and show how his relationship with Cloud is improved.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===

In &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Barret is introduced as the leader of the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE, which is situated in the city of Midgar and opposes the ruling company, Shinra, and their use of &quot;Mako&quot; energy as a power source, believing it to be killing the Planet. To this end, AVALANCHE bombs their Mako reactors, with the specific goal of saving the Planet. At the game&#x27;s beginning, they have hired the mercenary Cloud Strife at the behest of his childhood friend and AVALANCHE member Tifa Lockhart, nicknaming him &quot;Spiky&quot; in reference to his hairstyle. After the deaths of several AVALANCHE members, Barret follows Cloud out of Midgar in pursuit of the game&#x27;s villain, Sephiroth.

Along the way, he encounters a former friend of his, Dyne, who is armed similarly to him and forces Barret to fight him. After Barret defeats Dyne, Dyne kills himself. Later flashbacks reveal that Shinra wanted to build a Mako reactor in his hometown of Corel, an idea Barret advocated for. However, due to an accident at the plant, Shinra razed the town, killing Barret&#x27;s wife in the process and causing Barret and Dyne to flee with Dyne&#x27;s daughter, Marlene. Cornered, Dyne slipped off a cliff; Barret grabbed his hand, but Shinra soldiers opened fire and destroyed Barret&#x27;s and Dyne&#x27;s right and left hands respectively, causing the latter to fall to his presumed death. Barret adopted Marlene as his own daughter, had an &quot;adapter&quot; graft to his arm to interface with prosthetic weapons to aid in his combat against Shinra, and founded AVALANCHE. Dyne&#x27;s death causes him to admit his grudge with Shinra is solely for revenge, with his earlier claims of &quot;saving the world&quot; meant to convince himself he was fighting for the greater good. Barret eventually shifts his goal to wanting to save the Planet for Marlene&#x27;s sake, and he helps Cloud and his allies defeat Sephiroth to prevent the Planet&#x27;s destruction.

Early drafts of Barret&#x27;s background featured subtle differences, such as Marlene being as Barret&#x27;s biological daughter and his wife being executed in front of him by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra&#x27;s desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, being written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel&#x27;s ruins, while Cloud and the others fought to investigate Shinra soldiers.

===Other appearances===
Barret appears in &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, a 2005 mobile phone-based prequel which shows the events prior to Corel&#x27;s destruction. He helps the game&#x27;s protagonists, the Turks, defend the Mako reactor, believing it to be the town&#x27;s future. It is revealed that the reactor is under attack by the original AVALANCHE group, who are the cause of Shinra&#x27;s attack upon the town. Unaware of their involvement, Barret uses their ideals to form his own branch of the group. He was also one of the characters included in &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call&quot;, utilizing his classic appearance.

In 2005, Barret appeared in the CGI film &quot;Advent Children&quot;, which is set two years after the events of the game. Barret places Marlene in Tifa&#x27;s care and travels the world to rebuild the planet&#x27;s infrastructure and find alternate power sources to replace Mako. He returns later to assist in combating the film&#x27;s villains, the Remnants, and fight the summon creature Bahamut SIN. He later appears in a minor role in the 2006 video game &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;, which is set one year after &quot;Advent Children&quot;, where he helps the protagonist Vincent Valentine prevent Omega WEAPON from destroying the planet. When choosing a voice actor for the film, Nomura was initially unsure of whether to have Masahiro Kobayashi do the role of Barret or another character, Loz. Kobayashi described his performance as treating Barret as &quot;unrefined [...] but also dependable and unique&quot;, trying to keep his &quot;upbeat character and good outlook in mind&quot;. He tried to give him a booming, confident-sounding voice, though at times was instructed to &quot;take it up a notch&quot;. For &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, Mahito Funaki took over the role after Kobayashi retired from voice acting.

A novella entitled &quot;Case of Barret&quot; was released in 2007 exclusively for the &quot;Limited Edition Collector&#x27;s Set&quot; DVD edition of &quot;Advent Children&quot;. Written by Kazushige Nojima as part of the &quot;On the Way to a Smile&quot; series, it details the events between &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Advent Children&quot;, examining Barret&#x27;s reaction to his weapon and his belief that it made him a monster. At the conclusion of the story, Barret visits the creator of the adapter on his wrist and receives the prosthetic hand/gun combination seen in the film, reasoning that although he needs a hand, he also still needs a weapon to prevent others from having to fight. He then decides to return to Marlene. Barret was also added as a costume for the Mii &quot;gunner&quot;-class character and optional opponent in an update for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Prior to the game&#x27;s North American release, initial reactions to the character were positive, for representing African-Americans in a role-playing game, a genre where they were rarely represented. Following its North American release, Barret&#x27;s comparisons to Mr. T in the media has resulted in both praise and criticism, with most of the criticism accusing the character of serving as a negative racial stereotype of African Americans. &quot;IGN&quot; argued in favor of this point, citing his use of &quot;stilted slang&quot; and stating that the character stands out amongst the cast because &quot;his dialog is written as if it was run through a broken ebonic translator&quot;, further noting a trend in Japanese games to apply such dialogue to characters based on their skin color. Journalist Jeremy Parish and &quot;Next Generation&quot; reader Russell Merritt viewed the character as a racist representation, although both also argued that cultural gaps between Japan and the United States, plus the lack of American translators for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; may have been contributing factors, highlighting that the localization of Barret&#x27;s character presents him in a more stereotypical manner, drawing parallels to Mr. T. He felt this likeness could be seen as an effort to create a character that resonated with American audiences, given the popularity of the actor among Americans. &quot;Kotaku&quot;″s Gita Jackson expressed concern over his portrayal in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, expressing a desire to see the character&#x27;s dialogue and voice modernized from what she saw as a negative stereotype, and cited fan and even fellow &quot;Kotaku&quot; contributor interest in the same.

However in contrast on &quot;1UP&quot;, Parish argued in favor of Barret, noting that while on the surface he appeared to be the &quot;worst kind of stereotype&quot;, he was a great character with complexity, having made &quot;difficult decisions in his life, and agonized over his losses&quot;. Parish went further to describe Barret as the &quot;first true father figure the [&quot;Final Fantasy&quot;] series had ever seen&quot;, through his relationship with his adopted daughter and how much he doted on her. &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s content manager Shawn Bruckner took the discussion further, arguing that claims of Barret&#x27;s presentation being racist was oversimplification of the character&#x27;s portrayal, and stated that while he was in some aspects a stereotype, in others, such as his compassion towards his daughter or guilt regarding his past actions, he was not. He added that Barret &quot;shows us that a black man speaking in &#x27;ebonics&#x27; is not something to fear&quot; and that his portrayal was not racist, but instead the opposite. Andron Smith in the same publication meanwhile praised his paternal role for not only his daughter but the other characters, with his advice often reaching &quot;the realm of philosophy&quot; with concepts such as &quot;A good man who serves a great evil is not without sin&quot;.

His characterization in the remakes also received positive reception. &quot;Siliconera&quot;″s Jenni Lada stated that while early on in &quot;Remake&quot; he came across having &quot;only has one volume and he only sees one side of things&quot;, the agony over losing his friends and concern over his daughter, namely trying to cling to any hope of her survival, showed Barret&#x27;s actual heart and made her excited to see more of his portrayal in the future. Ash Parrish for &quot;Kotaku&quot; also commented on him, stating that while she had conflicted feelings about his portrayal and citing Jackson&#x27;s earlier article for the site, she praised the fact Barret went against the archetype of a father with a violent past, noting that similar characters routinely seemed incapable or unwilling to be gentle with their children. By comparison Parrish praised Barret&#x27;s affection towards his daughter and his refusal to let his past or who he was affect his relationship with her, adding that &quot;Barret did the reading from day one and said the inherited trauma stops with me&quot;. She further noted that Barret went against the myth of Black absentee fathers, being &quot;utterly devoted to a child that wasn&#x27;t even his own blood way back in 1997&quot; and expressed disdain that his role as a father was commonly overlooked by other publications. Gen Gumachi of &quot;Inside Games&quot; praised &quot;Rebirth&quot; for expanding on his character, portraying him as considering the views of the other party members while still retaining his &quot;manly&quot; personality as someone they could depend on. He also noted Barret&#x27;s reflection his shortcomings of a father, and it presented an interesting duality to Barret&#x27;s character: someone that had the wisdom of age, while also being a novice when it came to parenthood.

Pat Holleman, in his book &quot;Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VII&quot; (2018), considers Barrett&#x27;s story to be the clearest illustration of the game&#x27;s central &quot;theme of tragic survivorship&quot; and &quot;a deconstruction of a revenge story&quot; in the sense that it &quot;dismantles the idea of revenge in an insightful way&quot;. This is presented through Shinra&#x27;s destruction of his coal mining hometown, Barrett seeking vengeance through militant environmentalism before eventually realizing revenge isn&#x27;t the right motivation, and safeguarding a future for his adoptive daughter Marlene who is the only surviving connection to his past. William Hughes of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; notes that Barret and his terrorist cell AVALANCHE are one of the few examples of &quot;heroic pop culture terrorists&quot; in video games, keeping the game politically relevant in a post-9/11 world. 

On the other hand, Jervon Perkins of &quot;DualShockers&quot; expressed that while he liked Barret as a character and as a person of color enjoyed representation within the franchise, he felt far too often the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise treated black characters as a comedic relief archetype. He stated that in the context of the game, Barret&#x27;s behavior was often a good contrast to Cloud&#x27;s stoicism, and acted as a driving force to help push the game&#x27;s plot of saving the world. Additionally he was glad to see these elements retained in the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; remake titles, quickly becoming Perkins&#x27; favorite character in the cast, and enjoyed how they also built upon his relationship with Marlene and Dyne, particularly the tragedy of the latter. However, he was often also the butt of the game&#x27;s jokes, &quot;reacting to situations in loud and overreactive ways&quot; much to the rest of the cast&#x27;s humor. In light of the other black male character in the franchise at the time, Sazh from &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, he felt both men in part represented a stereotype of black individuals as &quot;loud and aggressive&quot;, and while strong characters were essentially cut from the same cloth. Perkins instead wished to see a character in the series that was by contrast &quot;introverted and quiet&quot; and exemplified the &quot;quiet strength exhibited by many characters in the series&quot; such as &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s Auron, and felt such would bring more diversity to the franchise while also respecting the legacy of characters such as Barret and Sazh.

<doc id="892757" wikidata="Q2996618" url="?curid=892757" title="Spahi">
<text>Spahis () were light-cavalry regiments of the French army recruited primarily from the Arab and Berber populations of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. The modern French Army retains one regiment of Spahis as an armoured unit, with personnel now recruited in mainland France. Senegal also maintains a mounted unit with spahi origins as a presidential escort: the Red Guard.

==Etymology==
The name is the French form of the Ottoman Turkish word , a word derived from New Persian , meaning &quot;army&quot;, or &quot;horsemen&quot;; or from , meaning &quot;warriors&quot;.

==Early history==
Following the French occupation of Algiers in 1830, detachments of locally recruited irregular horsemen were attached to the regiments of light cavalry assigned to North African service. These auxiliaries were designated as &quot;chasseurs spahis&quot;. Between 1834 and 1836 they were organised into four squadrons of regular spahis. In 1841 the 14 squadrons by then in existence were brought together in a single corps of spahis. Finally, in 1845 three separate Spahi regiments were created: the 1st of Algiers; the 2nd of Oran and the 3rd of Constantine.

The spahi regiments saw extensive service in the French conquest of Algeria, in the Franco-Prussian War, in Tonkin towards the end of the Sino-French War (1885), in the occupation of Morocco and Syria, and in both World Wars. A detachment of Spahis served as the personal escort of Marshal Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud in the Crimean War and were photographed there by Roger Fenton. A contingent of Spahis also participated in the North China campaign of 1860. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 one detached squadrons of Spahis formed part of the forces defending Paris, while a provisional regiment comprising three squadrons was attached to the Army of the Loire. A serious uprising against French rule in Algeria during 1871–72 was sparked off by a mutiny of the 5th squadron of the 3rd Spahis, who had been ordered to France to reinforce those units already there.

Under the Third Republic, between 1871 and 1914 Spahi units saw active service in Indochina, Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal and Madagascar.

While a visually conspicuous presence in any French military force, the Spahis usually served in small detachments as scouts, skirmishers and escorts. An exception was the Battle of Isly (Morocco) in 1844 when the 1st and 2nd Spahis fought successfully as full regiments.

==Recruitment basis==
Prior to 1914 there were four regiments of Spahis in the French Army, three based in Algeria and one in Tunisia. During their period as mounted cavalry the Spahis comprised for the most part Arab and Berber troopers commanded by French officers. This division was not absolute however and there were always a certain number of French volunteers in the ranks (for example, the later well known lyricist Raymond Asso was a Spahi between 1916 and 1919). About 20% of the rank and file were French and the remainder Arab or Berber. In addition, a fixed number of commissioned positions up to the level of captain were reserved for Muslim officers. NCOs were both French and Muslim.

In contrast to the North African tirailleur (infantry) units the mounted spahis were drawn from &quot;the big tents&quot;: i.e. the higher social classes of the Arab and Berber communities. This dated back to the establishment of the corps when required that each recruit provide his own horse.

As Spahi units were mechanized during World War II, the proportion of Frenchmen in the ranks increased.

==World War I==
Spahis were sent to France at the outbreak of war in August 1914. They saw service during the opening period of mobile warfare but inevitably their role diminished with the advent of trench warfare. During World War I the number of units increased with the creation of Moroccan Spahi regiments and the expansion of the Algerian arm. By 1918 there were seven Spahi regiments then in existence, all having seen service on the Western Front. In addition a detached squadron accompanied two squadrons of Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique and served as part of the 5th Light Horse Brigade during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Ottoman Empire. This composite force of French cavalry was known as the &quot;1er Régiment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie de Levant&quot;. In 1918 a &quot;marching regiment&quot; of Moroccan spahis (&quot;Régiment de Marche des Spahis Marocains&quot;) saw active service in the Balkans, winning the collective distinction of the &quot;Médaille militaire&quot;.

==Between the World Wars==
By 1921 the Spahi regiments had been increased to twelve (from four in 1914) and this became the permanent establishment. During the 1920s mounted Spahi regiments saw extensive active service in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, as well as in Morocco. They continued to perform policing and garrison duties in Algeria and Tunisia, as well as providing detachments based in Metropolitan France. Although mechanisation began in the 1930s of the &quot;Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique&quot; and Foreign Legion cavalry, the Spahis remained an entirely mounted force until after 1942.

==World War II==

In 1939 the Spahis comprised three independent brigades, each of two regiments and still horse mounted. Each regiment was made up of four sabre squadrons with five officers and 172 troopers in each. Three regiments saw active service in France in 1940. Hermann Balck was of the opinion that they were the best troops that he met in both world wars. One Spahi regiment (&quot;1er Régiment de Marche de Spahis Marocains&quot;) distinguished itself in service with the Free French during World War II. Garrisoned in Vichy-controlled Syria as part of a mounted cavalry unit some of the regiment crossed the frontier into the Transjordan in June 1940. After mounted service in Eritrea, this detachment was subsequently reorganised and equipped with armoured cars by the British in Egypt. The expanded and mechanised regiment served in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, and was part of the French forces that liberated Paris in August 1944.

==Post war==
In the course of World War II most Spahi regiments were mechanised, but several squadrons remained mounted for patrol work in North Africa plus escort and other ceremonial duties in France itself. Until 1961 the annual Bastille Day parade in Paris always featured Spahi cavalry in their traditional dress uniforms, on white Arabian horses. While Arab and Berber troopers continued to make up the bulk of numbers in the mounted units retained, mechanisation led to French personnel becoming a majority in the armoured regiments.

Armoured Spahi units saw service in both the Indochina War of 1947-54 and the Algerian War of 1954-62. The 9th Algerian Spahis remained a mounted regiment throughout the Algerian War, suffering 24 deaths in the course of active service. Except for one mounted platoon per squadron and the regimental &quot;fanfare&quot; (trumpeters) the unit was finally mechanized in 1961 and its several hundred horses either sold in Algeria or shipped back to France.

The 6th Spahis had been disbanded in 1956, followed by the 9th in 1961. Following the end of the Algerian War in 1962, the 2nd, 3rd 4th and 8th Spahis were also disbanded leaving only one, formerly Moroccan, regiment in existence as the 1st Spahis.

==Today==
Today, the French Army retains one Spahi regiment, the 1er Régiment de Spahis Marocains; an armoured unit which saw service in the Gulf War. The regiment also maintains the traditions of the entire Spahi corps as it previously existed.

Until 1984, the Regiment was located in Speyer, West Germany. Their former base there is now the Technikmuseum Speyer. The 1er Spahis are currently based in Valence, the French department of Drôme, south of Lyon, in the Rhone Valley, or what is commonly referred to in France as &quot;The Doors of Provence&quot;.

==Uniforms==
Throughout most of their history the Algerian and Tunisian Spahis wore a very striking Zouave style uniform. It comprised a high Arab headdress, a short red jacket embroidered in black, sky blue waist coat () a wide red sash and voluminous light blue trousers (white in hot weather). The four regiments were distinguished by the differing colours of their &quot;tombeaus&quot; (circular false pockets on the front of the jacket). A white burnous was worn together with a red cloak (dark blue cloak for the Moroccan Spahis after 1917). French officers wore light blue kepis, red tunics with gold rank braiding and light blue breeches with double red stripes. Muslim officers wore a more elaborate version of the &quot;tenue orientale&quot; of the Arab and Berber troopers. French Spahis were distinguished by wearing a fez instead of a white Arab turban with its brown camel-hair cord. A less obvious distinction was the footwear—short &quot;sabattes&quot; or traditional North African boots in red Morocco leather for Arab/Berber troopers, conventional black leather for French troopers.
From 1915, in common with other units of the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Afrique&quot;, a more practical khaki uniform was adopted for service, but the classic red and blue &quot;tenue orientale&quot; with white burnous reappeared for parade and off-duty wear in 1927. The mounted squadrons retained for ceremonial duties wore a slightly modified version of this parade uniform, with a plain white turban, until they were disbanded in 1962. The modern 1er Spahis still wear the traditional white burnous and red sash, together with the blue cloaks of the former Moroccan regiments, for full dress. The long-skirted sand-khaki &quot;gandourah&quot; coat adopted in 1915, appears on occasion as part of the modern ceremonial uniform. Headdress is either a scarlet forage cap or the standard light blue and red kepi of the French cavalry.

Exceptionally for a French armoured cavalry regiment, it uses gold (and not the usual silver) insignia. The &quot;Ordonnance du Roi portant organisation de la cavalerie indigène en Algerie&quot; of 7 December 1841 establishing the Spahis as a regular corps of the French Army specifies this distinction for &quot;sous-officers&quot;, &quot;brigadiers&quot; and officers both French and indigenous.

==Equipment==
In 1914 spahi armament was the M1822/82 sabre of the French light cavalry together with the 1892 carbine. All harness was of dark-red red leather, of indigenous North African pattern and manufacture.

==Indochinese Spahis==
Short-lived cavalry units designated as &quot;spahis&quot; were raised by the French Colonial Army in Indochina. The first of these was a squadron of spahis recruited from Cochinchina in 1861 and disbanded in 1871. The second was a small detachment of &quot;Spahis Tonkinese&quot; raised in Tonkin in 1883 and disestablished in 1889 for budgetary reasons.

==Spahis in other armies==
===Senegalese Spahis===
Senegal maintains a mounted cavalry detachment of spahi origin as its modern presidential security unit and ceremonial guard.

In addition to the North African cavalry, two squadrons of spahis were raised in French West Africa. The first spahis in Senegal were an Algerian detachment sent to West Africa in 1843 to deal with an outbreak of tribal conflict. This platoon-sized unit of 25 French and Algerian spahis stayed and began recruiting locally. The new indigenous troopers came from the inhabitants of Senegal and the French Sudan while their French officers were seconded from Algerian Spahi regiments. The Senegalese Spahis saw extensive active service in the French West African territories of Tchad, the Sudan and the Congo between 1853 and 1898, as well as serving in Morocco between 1908 and 1919.

The Senegalese Spahis were disbanded in 1928 as an economy measure but provided the cadre around which a newly-raised mounted gendarmerie was formed. The modern Gendarmerie Nationale of the Republic of Senegal therefore traces its origins to the spahis, and the Red Guard still wears the burnous, fez and red tunic of the French period.
===Algerian Republican Guard and Tunisian President&#x27;s Bodyguard===
The modern Republican Guard of Algeria includes a mounted detachment for ceremonial purposes. This unit is mounted on the same breed of white barbs as those utilised by the French spahis prior to 1962 and wear red and green uniforms with white burnouses, which broadly resemble those of their predecessors.

A similar ceremonial mounted unit is maintained as part of the Tunisian President&#x27;s Bodyguard. Descended from the 4th Tunisian Spahis Regiment the modern unit retains the uniform of the French period but in the red and white of the Tunisian national colours. `

===Italian Spahis===

The Italian colonial administration of Libya raised squadrons of locally-recruited Spahi cavalry between 1912 and 1942. The Italian Spahis differed from their French namesakes in that their prime role was that of mounted police, tasked with patrolling rural and desert areas. Although they had Italian officers, they were more loosely organised than the regular Libyan cavalry regiments (Savari). They wore a picturesque dress modelled on that of the desert tribesmen from whom they were recruited.

<doc id="892759" wikidata="Q1199059" url="?curid=892759" title="Tifa Lockhart">
<text>is a character who debuted in Square&#x27;s (now Square Enix) 1997 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. She was created as a foil to her teammate Aerith Gainsborough by members of the development team including director Yoshinori Kitase and writers Kazushige Nojima and Tetsuya Nomura; Nomura additionally contributed her visual design. She has since appeared as a playable fighter in &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot; and the &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; series and made cameo appearances in several other titles, such as &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and &quot;Itadaki Street&quot;. Beginning in 2005, she has been featured in sequels and spin-offs as part of the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; series, including the animated film &quot;Advent Children&quot; and the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; trilogy.

Tifa is the childhood friend of Cloud Strife, the protagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. She is the owner of the 7th Heaven bar in the slums of Midgar and a member of the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE. She convinces Cloud to join the group to keep him close and safe, and later assists in saving the Planet from the game&#x27;s villain, Sephiroth. Titles in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; later expanded upon her character, such as in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, where she attempts to convince Cloud to let go of his self-imposed guilt and move on with his life after Sephiroth&#x27;s defeat.

Tifa has been named the pin-up girl of the &quot;cyber generation&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and has been compared to Lara Croft as an example of a strong, independent, and attractive female character. Critics have repeatedly praised her strength and appearance and described her as one of the best female characters in video games. Her design&#x27;s sex appeal has received some criticism for overshadowing other aspects of her character.

==Conception and design==
Tifa was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and was not present in early versions of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as, initially, the game was to have only three playable characters: the protagonist Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough, and Barret Wallace. However, during a phone call to project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die. After much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura later joked that this was his idea, so as to enable him to introduce Tifa into the game. The notion of having two concurrent heroines and having the hero waver between them was something Kitase liked, describing it as something new in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. She was designed to use the &quot;monk&quot; character class that appeared in previous games in the series, and many aspects of her personality were taken from Aerith&#x27;s initial design.

In a change from previous entries in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, the development team worked from Nomura&#x27;s character designs; longtime series artist Yoshitaka Amano created his own versions as background, wanting to depict the characters in futuristic clothing. Tifa&#x27;s outfit consists of a white crop top and a black miniskirt held up by a pair of narrow black suspenders. She wears red boots and gloves, with black sleeves extending from wrist to elbow; a metal guard covers her left elbow. She stands about 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm) tall. Her hair is long and black in a style that resembles a dolphin&#x27;s tail. This longer fixed hairstyle helped to differentiate her visually from Aerith and was also easier to animate.

Unlike most other characters for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Nomura wrote down her bust/waist/hip measurements in his concept art for her, defined as 36-24-35&quot; (92-60-88 cm). Nomura wanted each character to have one striking feature, and in Tifa&#x27;s case it was her large breasts. Internally in the game, the development team jokingly referred to her as &quot;Boing-chan&quot;, an allusion to her bust. In an interview with Japanese magazine &quot;Jugemu&quot;, they discussed her character design, with composer Nobuo Uematsu commenting that her breasts were &quot;a bit...overly ample.&quot; Cutscene director Motonari Sakakibara countered that the rest of the team insisted against reducing their size. Nomura himself added &quot;at the end of the day we all like them. [...] If I made them smaller, everyone would get angry at me.&quot;

Initially, Nomura had difficulty deciding whether to go with a miniskirt or long pants. Seeking input, he passed his sketches around Square&#x27;s offices and the majority of the staff members approved of the miniskirt design. This additionally served as a contrast to Aerith, whose &quot;long skirt&quot; was her trademark. The attire was explained as giving her freedom of movement, due to her hand-to-hand combat specialty and the skirt, referred to as &quot;quite short [...] giving a considerable degree of exposure&quot;, was kept as a staple of her alternate costumes. The developers noted that due to her figure, her otherwise plain garments took on a pleasant appearance. The development team later clarified that the miniskirt was more akin to a skort instead of bare underwear, to keep her from being exposed during combat.

===Post-&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
When producing &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;, co-director Takeshi Nozue had difficulty developing a visual framework for Tifa that was &quot;balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities&quot;. Her outfit was redesigned with emphasis on expressing those qualities, while still being pleasing to the eye. Nomura describes her character in &quot;Advent Children&quot; as having several dimensions, calling her &quot;like a mother, a sweetheart and a close ally in battle&quot; and &quot;remarkably strong, not only emotionally, but physically as well&quot;. In the film, she wears a white tank top with a black zipped up vest, a pink ribbon around her left bicep, and boots. She also wears a black buttoned-up skirt that covers her thighs and wears shorts beneath it, with a piece of cloth similar to a coattail extending from the back of the skirt&#x27;s waistband and ending at her ankles. She no longer uses suspenders to hold up her skirt and she wears her gloves during the film&#x27;s fight scenes. Her hairstyle was changed to end at the middle of her back, with the removal of the dolphin tail from her original design. This alteration was due to the difficulty of animating her original length of hair, as well as visibility problems that arose from its black color and the lighting.

For the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; series, the development team worked heavily with Nomura to refine her design, working with artist Roberto Ferrari and character modeler Dan Suzuki. Details like charms were added around her wrists, and roughly twenty hair colors were considered before settling on ashen brown. The development team wanted to avoid favoring either Tifa or Aerith so they deliberately tried to give them equal screen time, as they wanted both to be positioned as heroines, and emphasized Eastern aesthetics and the cuteness of her face to contrast with Aerith&#x27;s Western aesthetics. They additionally wanted to emphasize her athletic physique, so they gave her visibly defined abdominal muscles. Square Enix&#x27;s ethics department requested changes to her clothing, giving her black undergarments and a form-fitting tank top to &quot;constrict&quot; her chest so it would not &quot;come off as unnatural during heavy action sequences&quot;. Suzuki considered the innerwear an improvement to her design. Some media outlets however misinterpreted the information and claimed her bust size had been reduced; the development team later illustrated that when creating her character model, a padded Japanese G70 cup size (95 cm) bra was used on a real-life model to portray it accurately.

Ferrari created the multiple alternate outfits included in &quot;Remake&quot; for Tifa, aiming for designs that would be easier on the animation team but would also pay homage to outfits she had in the original game. Various ideas were considered during development, including a maid costume and a bikini modelled after a chocobo, one of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series&#x27; mascots. They ultimately settled on a black cheongsam with her hair worn in pigtail buns, as well as a black kimono, both of which are worn with stockings. Ferrari commented that the latter was particularly difficult to create, as several of his design submissions were rejected during the process. In &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, two beachside outfits were added for her: a blue tied-up shirt and short shorts with her hair in a bun adorned with a flower, and a white- and blue-frilled bikini with a similar hairstyle.

===Casting===
Nomura noted that he liked Ayumi Ito as an actress and wished to work with her on &quot;Advent Children&quot;. With Aerith&#x27;s voice actor already decided, Nomura asked Ito to voice Tifa, feeling her &quot;husky voice&quot; would offer a good contrast to Maaya Sakamoto&#x27;s soft-spoken Aerith. Although Tifa&#x27;s updated design had already been finalized, Ito&#x27;s casting motivated them to blend many traits from the voice actress into the character&#x27;s appearance. Cloud&#x27;s voice actor Takahiro Sakurai said that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside Ito for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling &quot;deflated&quot;, as the &quot;exchanges he has with Tifa [could] be pretty painful&quot;. Ayaka Mitsumoto voiced Tifa in the flashback from &quot;Remake&quot; where a teenage Tifa interacts with Cloud. Whereas young Cloud&#x27;s casting was a challenge, they found an actress to match Ito&#x27;s voice quite quickly.

Rachael Leigh Cook, Tifa&#x27;s English voice actor in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, stated that she enjoyed playing Tifa and described her as &quot;very strong physically and emotionally, [but also] very sensitive&quot; and &quot;really multi-dimensional&quot;. In voicing the character, Cook listened to Ito&#x27;s recording as a guide to how the character sounds. Following &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Cook thanked Nomura for the film he created as she enjoyed it. Britt Baron voiced Tifa in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, and Tifa as a child is voiced by Glory Curda.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
Tifa is introduced in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as the childhood friend of Cloud Strife and owner of the 7th Heaven bar in the slums of Midgar, a technologically advanced metropolis owned by the Shinra Electric Power Company. She is also a member of the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE, who opposes Shinra&#x27;s extraction and use of mako, the planet&#x27;s spiritual energy, as a power source. When they reunite in Midgar, she convinces Cloud to join the group and follows him in pursuit of the game&#x27;s antagonist, Sephiroth. While she is unable to keep him from being manipulated by Sephiroth, she helps him recover after his mind becomes fractured and they realize their mutual feelings for one another, working together to defeat Sephiroth.

When they were children, Tifa and Cloud followed a path up the mountain near their hometown of Nibelheim. However, they were both injured and Tifa fell into a coma for a week, with her father holding Cloud responsible for the incident. Cloud eventually left to join Shinra&#x27;s SOLDIER program to become stronger, but it is later revealed that he did it primarily to attract her attention. In response, she requested if she were ever in danger, he would return to save her. Years later, during Sephiroth&#x27;s rampage in Nibelheim, Cloud rescued Tifa after she was wounded by Sephiroth. Tifa was taken to safety by her martial arts instructor and eventually arrived in Midgar, meeting AVALANCHE&#x27;s leader, Barret Wallace. She joined AVALANCHE to get revenge for the destruction of her home. Shortly before the beginning of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, she encountered an incoherent Cloud at the city&#x27;s train station and convinced him to work for Barret, to keep him close and watch over him.

Her character changed significantly during development, with an early relationship chart depicting her as Sephiroth&#x27;s sibling. In preliminary drafts of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Tifa was a background character with a particular fondness for Cloud whose role in AVALANCHE was to provide support behind the scenes and to cheer everyone up after missions. She was supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. Masato Kato, one of the event planners, proposed a scene in which she and Cloud had sex but it was replaced with a toned-down version by Kitase wherein a suggestive line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview, Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become an issue at the time. When developing the international edition of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, an additional cutscene was added to showcase an enemy in the game, Ultima Weapon, and featured Tifa in it due to how popular her character had become.

===&quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
Tifa appears in the 2005 film &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;, which is set two years after the events of the game. She tries to give emotional support to Cloud, urging him to come to terms with the unwarranted guilt he places upon himself. She also takes care of Barret&#x27;s adopted daughter Marlene and an orphan, Denzel. During the film, she duels against Loz and battles the summoned creature Bahamut SIN alongside the team. Script writer Kazushige Nojima described her role in the film as &quot;very much like any woman who&#x27;s been left behind by a man&quot;, stating that while they did not want her to appear clingy, they wanted to portray that she was emotionally hurt by Cloud&#x27;s departure. In the film&#x27;s initial draft, she was intended to have a more central role in the then-short film, which only included herself, Cloud and several children, with the story revolving around a note being delivered to him.

Tifa is featured in the prequel games &quot;Before Crisis&quot; and &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, as well as the OVA &quot;Last Order&quot;, which each provide different perspectives on the destruction of Nibelheim. The novella &quot;Case of Tifa&quot;, written as part of the &quot;On the Way to a Smile&quot; series, is a story set between the original game and &quot;Advent Children&quot; that is told from her point of view. The story details how she creates a new 7th Heaven bar in the city of Edge and attempts to hold onto the concept of a normal family with herself and Cloud, despite him beginning to isolate himself from others. Tifa also appears in the game &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;, which is set one year after the events of &quot;Advent Children&quot;, in which she helps the protagonist Vincent Valentine defend the planet against the monster Omega WEAPON; in the game&#x27;s epilogue, she discusses Vincent&#x27;s disappearance.

Tifa is a prominent playable character in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;. By focusing solely on the Midgar portion of the original game in &quot;Remake&quot;, the development team was able to include additional scenes that developed the relationship between Tifa and Aerith. &quot;Traces of Two Pasts&quot;, a tie-in novel to the remake, depicts the childhoods of Tifa and Aerith. Tifa&#x27;s section details her upbringing in Nibelheim, her meeting and tutelage under her martial arts master, and her life in the slums of Midgar following her near-death experience during the Nibelheim incident.

===Other appearances===
Outside of the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Tifa is an unlockable character and optional boss in the fighting game &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;. She is a playable character in the electronic board games &quot;Itadaki Street Special&quot; and &quot;Itadaki Street Portable&quot;. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, she appears in her &quot;Advent Children&quot; attire, searching for Cloud and later fighting various Heartless. She was originally planned to appear in the &quot;Final Mix&quot; version of the original &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, but due to time constraints the staff members chose to incorporate Sephiroth instead. Whereas in the game, Cloud goes missing after a battle with Sephiroth, in the manga adaptation, Tifa finds him in Hollow Bastion. In 2015, she was added to the mobile game &quot;Final Fantasy: Record Keeper&quot; as a playable character.

Tifa is one of the playable characters in the fighting game &quot;Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy&quot;, which features characters from various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. She initially wears her original outfit, but the player has access to her &quot;Advent Children&quot; outfit and a third outfit based on her appearance in the Nibelheim flashback. The first print run of the game features another form based on artwork by Yoshitaka Amano. In &quot;LittleBigPlanet 2&quot;, Tifa appears as a downloadable character model, and as a Mii costume and Spirit in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Since her introduction critics and fans reacted positively to Tifa, often appearing near the top of fan polls. &quot;The New York Times&quot; named her as the pin-up girl of the &quot;cyber generation&quot;, while &quot;The Beaumont Enterprise&quot; cited Tifa as an example of a strong female character in video games in the mold of Lara Croft from the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series. Holly Boson of &quot;Polygon&quot; described Tifa as defined by her &quot;brittle confidence and supportiveness&quot;, further stating her belief that in the context of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, she represents forcefulness and sexuality. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Matthew Byrd attributed her popularity to her warmth, strength, and the ability to act both supportive and as a leader depending on the situation, but also noted her vulnerability and how it made her a well-rounded character &quot;who is more than worthy of her fan-favorite status&quot;. Jenni Lada of &quot;Siliconera&quot; called her an iconic heroine and praised how &quot;Remake&quot; built upon her character.

Tifa is often contrasted with Aerith, the other female protagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Gus Turner of &quot;Complex&quot; described her as a feminine foil to the more &quot;girlish&quot; Aerith and emphasized her agency and empowerment. Leigh Alexander argued that Tifa is the true heroine of the story, present since the beginning and indispensable in the course of events, calling her &quot;a partner for a grown-up player&quot; and wondered how many players did not properly appreciate her on their first playthrough of the game. Fans of the series have heavily debated which character was a better match for Cloud since the initial game&#x27;s release, comparing the pros and cons of each. Boson observed that supporters of each side often misrepresented the other&#x27;s chosen heroine. She concluded that there was no winning couple as, after killing Sephiroth, Cloud has a vision of Aerith when Tifa tries to help him and the two agree to meet her again in the afterlife.

&quot;RPGamer&quot; editor Marie Freed found that when examining Tifa as a character, she came to appreciate her more than Aerith in the years since the original release. She posited that Aerith represented more of an ideal than a character. Tifa was portrayed as someone who was &quot;insecure, lonely, and hides her true emotions&quot;, which may have led to her being received negatively, but in Freed&#x27;s eyes made her the more human of the pair. Freed found her insecurity over her appearance reasonable and relatable, both within the fiction and as an imposition by critics and fans. She also welcomed the contrast to the &quot;destined&quot; romance seen in &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, finding it a more realistic relationship that persevered through trauma. Freed closed by noting that while people had aspects of both characters in them, Tifa ultimately represented &quot;reality&quot; over the &quot;ideal&quot;.

On the other hand, Patrick Holleman in his book &quot;Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VII&quot; described Tifa as having &quot;the most typical story of a near-death experience and the loss of a world she belonged to&quot; of the game&#x27;s cast, despite how atypical Cloud was by comparison. Cloud represented her only living connection to her past and, to this end, Holleman believed she ignored the discrepancies in how he remembered events bordering on psychosis not as a matter of romance but as a means to hold onto what she lost. He viewed her desire for Cloud as selfish and ultimately did her more harm than good. However, he also praised a particular moment for her character later in the game when she confronts Scarlet, a secondary antagonist. The scene initially appears to lead into a boss battle against Scarlet, but Tifa instead engages in a slap fight with her, something he felt subverted the player&#x27;s expectations well.

===As a sex symbol===
A significant part of Tifa&#x27;s reception has focused on her sex appeal, with some unlicensed merchandise leaning heavily into this aspect. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarded her the &quot;Hottest Game Babe&quot; of 1997, calling her &quot;as well-proportioned as they come&quot;, but also noted her physical and emotional strength as a character. &quot;UGO.com&quot; shared similar sentiments, complimenting her outfit and describing her as a &quot;bona-fide sex symbol&quot;, highlighting that she was a rarity among female characters in video games at the time. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Phil Pirrello attributed a large part of her popularity to her chest size, noting that she was an example of how the series tried to add real sex appeal with &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. While her model in the original game was primitive by modern standards, he suggested it had a significant impact on the teenage demographic. Fellow contributor Dave Smith suggested similar, stating it was hard to sing her praises &quot;without sounding just a little teeny-weeny bit sexist&quot;, but added that she helped define &quot;tough, independent&quot; role-playing game heroines that came after her.

The character has been a frequent subject of fan-made pornography, cited in particular as a frequent search topic on Pornhub. A study of such content on Rule 34 websites such as Rule34.xxx and Sankaku Channel cited her as the most frequent subject of such content by a wide margin across multiple franchises. In January 2022, a Zoom video conference meeting in the Italian Senate was interrupted by a user displaying 3D-rendered pornography featuring Tifa engaging in sexual intercourse. The user was quickly removed, but due to the conference being televised, knowledge of the event went viral. Although the choice to use Tifa was incidental, it led to a surge in the character&#x27;s popularity. Jade King of &quot;TheGamer&quot; noted however that while much of the reaction revolved around fan art of a sexual nature, it also resulted in a large amount of what they considered &quot;wholesome&quot; art celebrating the character and the humor of the situation, usually portraying her in an awkward or comedic manner in association with the event or the country itself. King credited the response to the enduring nature of the character, compounded by &quot;Remake&quot;″s recent release, calling it an &quot;aspect of Tifa&#x27;s character that will now be ingrained into her history&quot;.

Other articles observed that the emphasis on her sex appeal sometimes overshadowed her other aspects. In another article for &quot;IGN&quot;, the staff acknowledged that while her design was meant to emphasize physical beauty, her &quot;awe-inspiring strength, complex background, strong will and her attachment to Cloud&quot; defined her as more than &quot;just an eye-catching woman&quot;, naming her a legendary heroine in the series. The book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy VII&quot; noted that while Tifa has many attributes of a seductive woman, exemplified by her large breasts, she &quot;thwarts the stereotypes associated with her appearance&quot; due to being an independent and strong character, identifying her as the most &quot;leveled headed&quot; and pragmatic character in the game&#x27;s cast. Philip Bloom of &quot;RPGamer&quot; felt that while fans and critics alike both overemphasized her beauty, to the point she set a perceived standard for other attractive female role-playing game protagonists, she &quot;isn&#x27;t that absurd of figure&quot; and was instead &quot;quite strong as far as female heroes go, often saving the day. But you wouldn&#x27;t know it to listen to talks about her.&quot;

<text>Air Force Base Hoedspruit is an airbase of the South African Air Force. It is located adjacent to the Kruger National Park. In the late 1990s an unused portion of the base was converted into a civilian airport known as Eastgate Airport. It was also an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle.

==Units hosted==

* 19 Squadron - Helicopter squadron
* 101 Squadron - Light transport (reserve)
* 514 Squadron - Security services
* 7 Aircraft Servicing Unit - Maintenance support
* Lowveld Airspace Control Sector - Airspace control
* Air Force Command and Control School - Training

==History==

The base was officially opened on 1 July 1978. It was designed from the start to be a highly protected wartime base. As such, it has armoured and Hardened Aircraft Shelters, with revetments placed close to the runways for aircraft on immediate take-off standby duty.

The base is teeming with wildlife, being surrounded by the 25 km² AFB Hoedspruit Game Reserve. Keeping the runway clear of animals was a massive problem. This led the base to introduce three cheetahs on the airfield, with the end result that animal incursions onto the runway have decreased by 90%. Another SAAF base, AFB Makhado, has since also adopted this concept.

The base gained international media attention in 2000, when it hosted the United States Air Force&#x27;s rescue contingent as part of Operation Atlas Response, the mission to provide rescue and humanitarian support to areas of Mozambique devastated by the severe flooding caused by Cyclone Eline.

The base motto is &quot;Pro Nostrorum Pace&quot; (Peace for our People).

==Eastgate Airport==
A civil airport terminal, known as the Eastgate Airport, was established at the southern end of the airfield in the early 1990s. The terminal&#x27;s main business is serving tourists visiting private game reserves in the area as well as access to the Kruger National Park via the nearby Orpen Gate. Facilities at the terminal include car hire and foreign exchange.

Charter flights are offered by Federal Air, Genair, Cesszani, Execujet, SA Historical Flight and Bataleur.

<text>Eldorado Gold Corporation is a Canadian company that owns and operates gold mines in Turkey, Greece and Canada. Since its merger with European Goldfields in 2011 the company has been pursuing the development of the Skouries mine, Olympias mine and Stratoni mine in Greece. The company previously developed and operated gold mines in China, Brazil and Mexico. Headquartered in Vancouver and listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges, Eldorado Gold has developed and operated assets from several merged companies HRC Developments Corporation, Afcan Mining Corporation, Sino Gold Mining, Brazauro Resources, Integra Gold, as well as European Goldfields.

== Corporate history ==
The Eldorado Corporation was incorporated in Bermuda on April 2, 1992, by several entrepreneurs who worked together at Bema Gold. The group had agreed to a contract that would give them a 70% interest in the Mexican La Colorada mining project if they were able to bring the mine into commercial production. In early 1994, La Colorada became Eldorado&#x27;s first productive mine and by the end of the year they had purchased its remaining interest. Meanwhile, they also fulfilled a similar contract, conducting development-related work in exchange for ownership interest, in the La Trinidad project, also in Mexico. While the mine began production in 1996, and Eldorado gained 100% ownership in 1997, it was shut down and then sold off in 1998 as the price of gold collapsed; La Colorada was sold in 2000 for the same reason.

In April 1996, after fending off a hostile takeover bid by Glamis Gold the previous year, the company was renamed to Eldorado Gold Corporation and had its domicile moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. That year, they acquired the Brazilian São Bento, as well as exploration properties in Brazil and Turkey, from Gencor in exchange for a 43% stake in the company. Gencor made a similar deal with Vancouver Stock Exchange-listed HRC Developments Corporation, 43% of the company for several exploration properties, and then Eldorado and HRC merged to form one company. São Bento would be the company&#x27;s sole operating mine from 2000 to 2006 as it focused on developing the Kişladağ project in Turkey.

Eldorado Gold increased the gold production from 64,298 ounces in 2005 to 632,539 ounces in 2010, despite the closure of the São Bento in 2007, by bringing Kişladağ into production in 2006, acquiring the Toronto Stock Exchange-listed Afcan Mining Corporation for its Tanjianshan Mine which it had acquired two years previous from Sino Gold Mining, and then acquiring Australian Securities Exchange-listed Sino Gold Mining, in a 2009 $1.6 billion all-stock deal, for their new Jinfeg and White Mountain mines. During this period of growth, Eldorado and Centerra Gold considered merging their operations but were unable to find sufficient advantages. Eldorado went on to be added to the S&amp;P/TSX 60 in 2009 as one of the largest companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 2010 Eldorado acquired, in an all-stock deal worth $122 million, TSX Venture Exchange-listed Brazauro Resources for their share of the Brazilian Tocantinzinho exploration project. Later that year, Eldorado offered a $3.4-billion all-stock deal to acquire ASX-listed Andean Resources for their Cerro Negro project but were out-bid by Goldcorp who offered $3.6-billion in cash and stocks. Instead, Eldorado went on to acquire TSX-listed European Goldfields for $2.5-billion in stocks for its projects in Greece, as well as exploration properties in Romania, such as Certej mine. Eldorado&#x27;s gold production peaked at 789,224 ounces in 2014 from its three mines in China, the Kişladağ mine in Turkey, supplemented by its second Turkish mine (Efemcukuru) which came online in 2012 and the old Olympias mine in Greece which the company was able to begin retreatment of leftover tailings.

Eldorado Gold began a years long decline as it committed to selling its mines in China in favour of developing its properties in Greece. At the time, during its economic crisis, Greece was actively seeking foreign investment and its Skouries project had the potential to be a high producing, long-lived (over 20 years) gold and copper mine. Other companies had previously attempted to develop the Skouries mine but the government had deemed it as not being in the national interest but the need for foreign investment reversed that decision. However, Eldorado&#x27;s projects in the Chalkidiki region had long been controversial as other mining projects left locals with little confidence in the government&#x27;s ability to effectively regulate mining and manage economic development. The company spent US$1 billion by 2017, mostly on the Skouries project, without completing a mine and experiencing protests against the project, due to land clearing in a popular forest and anticipated impacts to environmental values, tourism and agriculture, as well as protests in favour citing the number of jobs the mining project represented. Eldorado Gold&#x27;s assets in China were sold to China National Gold Group Corporation and the Shenzhen-listed Yintai Resources Company for a cumulative US$900-million in 2016 resulting in its gold production falling to 292,971 ounces in 2017. Despite having gained the Lamaque mine in Quebec with the company&#x27;s $590 million cash and stock acquisition of TSX Venture-listed Integra Gold, the company suspended dividend payments in 2018 and their stock briefly fell under CDA$1, all while company was accused of using Dutch subsidiaries for tax avoidance purposes and excessively compensating executive management for poor performance.

== Operations ==
As of 2020, Eldorado Gold operates 5 mines:
*Kişladağ gold mine, located in Uşak, Turkey, has been the company&#x27;s highest producing mine since its opening in 2006. The property was acquired by Eldorado with its 1996 merger with HRC Development and developed as a low-grade open pit mine with heap leaching to produce gold dore.
*Efemçukuru mine, located in İzmir, Turkey, near the village of Efemçukuru, reached commercial production in 2012. It is an underground mine targeting a high-grade deposit whose ore is sold to third parties for processing elsewhere.
*Lamaque mine, located in Val-d’Or, Quebec, Canada, is an underground gold mine that reached commercial production on March 31, 2019.
*Olympias mine, located in the Chalkidiki region of Greece, is an underground gold-silver-lead-zinc mine that ships ore concentrates from port facilities in Thessaloniki and Stratoni for processing elsewhere. It was acquired in Eldorado&#x27;s business combination with European Goldfields in 2012 and reached commercial production in 2017.
*Stratoni mine, located in the Chalkidiki region of Greece, near Stratoni, is an underground silver-lead-zinc mine that ships ore concentrates from port facilities in Stratoni for processing elsewhere.

===Past operations===
*La Colorada, located in Sonora, Mexico, was Eldorado Gold&#x27;s original mine. It began production in 1994 but was sold in 2000 to a private Mexican company.
*La Trinidad, located in Sinaloa, Mexico, was brought into production by Eldorado in 1996 but was sold in 1998.
*São Bento, located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, was purchased from Gencor in 1996 and operated through to 2006.
*Tanjianshan, located in a mountainous desert in Qinghai, China, the open gold pit mine was brought into production in 2007, following Eldorado&#x27;s acquisition of the Afcan Mining Corporation. The high-altitude mine produced approximately 110,000 ounces annually of gold dore until 2016 when it was sold.
*Jinfeg, located in Guizhou, China, the mine was a combined open pit and underground operation targeting a deep deposit. It was acquired by Eldorado with its 2009 acquisition of Sino Gold. The mine produced between 110,000 and 180,000 ounces of gold dore each year until 2016 when it was sold. 
*White Mountain, located in Jilin, China, near the city of Baishan. The underground mine was acquired by Eldorado in 2009 shortly after its opening. The mine produced between 60,000 and 85,000 ounces of gold dore each year until 2016 when it was sold.
*Vila Nova iron ore mine, located in Amapá, Brazil, operated from 2011 to 2014 and has since been on care and maintenance.

== Environmental Impact ==

=== Greece ===
The mining operation at Olympiada has been found to be in violation of Greek environmental protection laws by an inspection committee of the Greek Ministry of the Environment and Energy. The inspectors discovered, among other violations, concentrations over the allowed limits of cadmium, lead and arsenic in a water stream used by the mining operation.

<text>The Miles Franklin Literary Award is an annual literary prize awarded to &quot;a novel which is of the highest literary merit and presents Australian life in any of its phases&quot;. The award was set up according to the will of Miles Franklin (1879–1954), who is best known for writing the Australian classic &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1901). She bequeathed her estate to fund this award. As of 2016, the award is valued at A$60,000.
==Winners==

===1957–1969===
===1970–1979 ===
===1980–1989===
===1990–1999===
===2000–2009===
===2010–2019===
===2020–===
== Controversies ==
Author Frank Moorhouse was disqualified from consideration for his novel &quot;Grand Days&quot; because the story was set in Europe during the 1920s and was not sufficiently Australian.

1995 winner Helen Darville, also known as Helen Demidenko and Helen Dale, won for &quot;The Hand That Signed the Paper&quot; and sparked a debate about authenticity in Australian literature. Darville claimed to be of Ukrainian descent and said it was fiction based on family history. Writer David Marr, who presented the award to her, said that revelations about her true background did not &quot;alter a single thing about the quality of the story, it knocks completely out of the water her answers to critics who said it was not historically accurate, that she knows because of direct family experience, which appears to be complete bull----.&quot;

Even before the hoax was revealed, Darville’s book was considered anti-Semitic and justified the genocide of Jewish people. It was also later revealed that she plagiarised from multiple sources.

In 2004, judges of the award resigned due to what they viewed as the commodification of the awards.

2022 longlisted writer John Hughes was accused of plagiarising significant sections of his 2021 book &quot;The Dogs&quot; from Nobel Laureate Svetlana Alexievich&#x27;s nonfiction book &quot;The Unwomanly Face of War&quot;. Nearly 60 similarities and identical sentences were found in a comparison of Hughes&#x27; novel and the English version of Alexievich&#x27;s book. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper also found similarities between incidents described in the books, including the central scene from which &quot;The Dogs&quot; takes its title. Further investigation found other examples of plagiarism in the novel and that Hughes copied sections of classic texts including &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; without acknowledging the original source. The book was subsequently withdrawn from competition.

The Stella Prize was created in 2013 as a reaction to the supposed under-representation of women as winners of literary prizes, in particular the 2011 Miles Franklin Award shortlist. However, since 2013, only one man (A. S. Patrić in 2016) has won the Miles Franklin Award.

<text>Emera Incorporated is a publicly traded Canadian multinational energy holding company based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Created in 1998 during the privatization of Nova Scotia Power, a provincial Crown corporation, Emera now invests in regulated electricity generation as well as transmission and distribution across North America and the Caribbean.

==History==

Emera was created out of the privatization of the provincial Crown corporation Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (NSPI). On December 2, 1998, NSPI shareholders voted to restructure the company to create a holding company which would be shareholder-owned, with the regulated utility being a wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company. On December 9, 1998, NSPI received approval to establish NS Power Holdings Incorporated and NSPI shareholders exchanged their shares in NSPI for shares in NS Power Holdings Inc. on a one-to-one basis on January 1, 1999. Common shares in NS Power Holdings Inc. began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange and Montreal Stock Exchange on January 6, 1999. The NS Power Holdings Inc. name was changed to Emera Incorporated on July 17, 2000.

In 2013, Emera acquired the Bridgeport Energy, Rumford Power, and Tiverton Power plants from Capital Power Corporation for $541 million.

On September 4, 2015, Emera announced the acquisition of TECO Energy, a utility company based in Tampa, Florida, whose holdings include Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas (no relation to the Chicago-based company of the same name), and New Mexico Gas. Emera paid $10.4 billion for TECO. The deal closed in July 2016.

<text>Otis Williams (born Otis Miles Jr.; October 30, 1941) is an American second tenor/baritone singer. He is occasionally also a songwriter and a record producer. Williams is the founder and last surviving original member of the Motown vocal group The Temptations, a group in which he continues to perform; he also owns the rights to the Temptations name.

==Early life==
Williams was born Otis Miles Jr. in Texarkana, Texas, to Otis Miles and Hazel Louise Williams. The couple separated shortly after their son&#x27;s birth. While he was still a toddler, his mother married and moved to Detroit, Michigan, leaving the young Otis to be raised by both of his grandmothers in Texarkana.

Hazel Williams moved her son to Detroit when he was ten years old, where he lived with her and his stepfather.

==Career==

=== 1950s–1990s ===

Becoming interested in music as a teenager, Otis Miles Jr. adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name for his stage name, and as &quot;Otis Williams&quot; put together a number of singing groups. These groups included Otis Williams and the Siberians, the El Domingoes, and the Distants.In 1959, The Distants
scored a local hit, co-written by Williams and their producer Johnnie Mae Matthews, &amp; manager Milton Jinkins called &quot;Come On&quot;, with lead vocals by Richard Street. Later Distants recordings were not as successful, and after an offer from Berry Gordy of Motown Records, Williams and his friends/bandmates Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant and Melvin Franklin while Peewee Crawford &amp; Richard Street quit the Distants. Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams from The Primes later joined Williams, Bryant, and Franklin to create the Elgins, who signed to Motown in March 1961 as &quot;The Temptations&quot;, after being told another group was already using that name.

The Temptations became one of the most successful acts in soul music over the course of nearly five decades, during which singers such as David Ruffin, Dennis Edwards, former Distant Richard Street, Damon Harris, Ron Tyson, Ali-Ollie Woodson, Theo Peoples, Ray Davis and former Spinners singer G. C. Cameron have all been members. As a member of the Temptations, he sings both Tenor and Baritone vocals.

The Temptations biggest selling tracks include: My Girl, and (I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You, among many others. The groups have won four Grammy Awards, and have been nominated for nine.

Although he has served the longest tenure in the Temptations, Williams rarely sings lead, focusing instead on his role as the group&#x27;s leader and organizer, and as the background &quot;baritone in the middle&quot;. Some examples are The Smokey Robinson and Eddie Kendricks written track &quot;Don&#x27;t Send Me Away&quot; from the LP &quot;The Temptations with a Lot o&#x27; Soul&quot; (1967) and the intro on the early group song &quot;Check Yourself&quot; (1961).

Most notably, rare showcases for Williams singing lead are: &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; from the 1968 albums &quot;Live at London&#x27;s Talk of the Town&quot; and &quot;Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes Join the Temptations&quot; and The Norman Whitfield-penned tune &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Nothing&quot; from 1972&#x27;s &quot;All Directions&quot;

Williams has provided non-singing (spoken word) contributions to some Temptation songs, including: &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; (1968, a hit duet with Diana Ross and Eddie Kendricks sharing the lead vocals), &quot;I&#x27;m the Exception to the Rule&quot;, from the album &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit (The Temptations album)&quot; (1971) which features leads from both Eddie Kendricks and Dennis Edwards, During the opening verse of &quot;Masterpiece&quot; (1973), and &quot;For Your Love&quot;, which is done in a medley with &quot;You Send Me&quot; (led by Ali-Ollie Woodson) on the &quot;For Lovers Only&quot; album (1995).

=== 1990s–present ===

The Temptations lineup changes were so frequent, stressful and troublesome that Williams and Melvin Franklin promised each other they would never quit the group. Franklin would remain in the group until 1994, when he became physically incapable of continuing. Franklin died on February 23, 1995, leaving Otis Williams, then 53, as the last surviving original member of the quintet.

Williams still remains in the Temptations as of 2024, has performed on every release by the band, including their most recent studio album, &quot;Temptations 60&quot;, released on January 28, 2022, which also included a collaboration with Motown artist Smokey Robinson.

== Additional works ==
Williams is the co-author, with Patricia Romanowski, of &quot;Temptations&quot;, a 1988 book that served as both his autobiography and a history of the group. Ten years later, the book was adapted into an NBC television miniseries &quot;The Temptations&quot;. Williams was portrayed by actor Charles Malik Whitfield.

==Personal life==
Williams married Josephine Rogers in 1961; the couple&#x27;s son, Otis Lamont Miles, was born the same year. He and Josephine divorced in 1964. Otis Lamont Miles was a construction worker who died from falling off a building in a workplace accident in Detroit in 1985. Williams was engaged to Patti LaBelle. She ended the engagement when he asked her to quit music and become a housewife.

Williams was married to Ann Cain from 1967 to 1973. Cain was Ike Turner and Tina Turner&#x27;s housekeeper. He married his third wife, Arleata &quot;Goldie&quot; Williams (née Carter), in 1983. Arleata Williams&#x27; daughter Elan Carter was &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s Playmate of the Month for June 1994.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1989, Otis Williams was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Temptations. Williams received an honorary doctorate from Stillman College in May 2006.

==In popular culture==
*Charles Malik Whitfield portrayed Williams in the 1998 NBC-TV miniseries &quot;The Temptations&quot;.
*&quot;Aint Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations&quot;, a musical based on Williams&#x27; memoir &quot;The Temptations&quot; premiered at Berkeley Repertory Theater in September 2017. Williams was played by Derrick Baskin. The show then reached Broadway&#x27;s Imperial Theater, opening March 21, 2019. 
The musical then debuted on the West End in the Prince Edward Theatre in 2023.

<text>MVRDV is a Rotterdam, Netherlands-based architecture and urban design practice founded in 1993, with additional offices in Berlin, New York, Paris, and Shanghai. It is currently regarded as one of the world&#x27;s finest architecture firms. MVRDV is an acronym of the founding members&#x27; surnames: Winy Maas, Jacob van Rijs, and Nathalie de Vries.

==History==
Maas and Van Rijs worked at OMA, De Vries at Mecanoo before starting MVRDV.

The trio studied architecture together at the Delft University of Technology, Netherlands and won the &quot;Europan 2&quot; competition with their project &quot;Berlinvoids&quot; in 1991 before founding MVRDV two years later. The situation for starting a new office in the Netherlands was favourable - government support for young architects means all three received a grant to help start their architectural practice.

It took some time for the company to get going, working without a fixed office until the firm&#x27;s first major commission arrived. This was the new offices for the public broadcasting corporation VPRO in Hilversum, the Netherlands (1993–1997). Other early built works include the Wozoco housing in Amsterdam (1994–1997) and the Dutch Pavilion at the Hannover World Exhibition Expo 2000 (1997–2000). These were followed by a business park &#x27;Flight Forum&#x27; in Eindhoven, Gemini Residence silo conversion in Copenhagen, the Silodam Housing complex in Amsterdam, the Matsudai Cultural Centre in Japan, Unterföhring office campus near Munich, the Lloyd Hotel in Amsterdam, an urban plan and housing in The Hague Ypenburg, the rooftop – housing extension Didden Village in Rotterdam, the cultural Centre De Effenaar in Eindhoven, the boutique shopping building Gyre in Tokyo, part of Veldhoven&#x27;s Maxima Medical Centre, and the iconic Mirador housing estate in Madrid. Recently completed projects include a public library in Spijkenisse, the Netherlands, a shopping center in Schijndel, the Netherlands, a bank headquarters in Oslo, Norway, and most recently a public market hall, combining housing and shopping within the shape of a monumental arch, in Rotterdam.

Current projects in progress or on site include various housing projects in the Netherlands, China, France, India, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries, a sustainable office building in Paris, a central business district in Shanghai, an office tower in Poznań, a museum of rock music and a community cultural centre in Roskilde and Frederiksberg respectively, large scale urban masterplans in Oslo, Bordeaux and Caen, an entire new eco-city in Logrono, Spain, a structural development vision for Dutch New Town Almere, the masterplan for the Floriade (Netherlands) Horticultural Expo 2022, also in Almere, and a research masterplan into the future of greater Paris which was commissioned by French president Nicolas Sarkozy and the mayor of Paris Bertrand Delanoë.

MVRDV also maintains a research-oriented project called &quot;The Why Factory&quot;, which the company describes as an &quot;independent think-tank and research institute&quot;. It is run together with the Delft University of Technology.

==Influences==
In a 2010 interview with Designboom, Winy Maas cited Rem Koolhaas as one of the most important people that he had worked with and for, describing parts of MVRDV&#x27;s work as intellectual responses to Koolhaas&#x27;s questions. The architect and critic Rafael Moneo has noted the common featured between OMA and MVRDV, starting with the positioning of the architect in their draft process, with projects treated as collaborative efforts and the architect acting as a catalyst, An article in El Croquis further argued that &quot;if the notion of creation is still present in their discourse, it is more than a co-creation or synergy between all the parties than as the exclusive vision or synthesis of an architect.&quot;

The concept of densification - where the population density or building density is increased via taller buildings or adding more housing units - is a topic Koolhaas focused heavily on in his book &quot;Delirious New York&quot;. Reflection on the notion of densification also comprises a significant part of MVRDV&#x27;s research, for instance in their publications &quot;FARMAX&quot; and &quot;KM3&quot;, with Maas further noting that &quot;... proximity makes sense. That&#x27;s a fundamental part of our culture for many of us.&quot; In El Croquis, architect Fernando Márquez Cecilia notes that &quot;through these conceptual overlaps, the projects of the two offices show in some cases even strong formal accordance, as in the case of the VPRO Building and the Educatorium&quot;.

Maas has also noted that the Club of Rome warnings made in the 1960s over the dangers of global growth, which Maas heard as a ten-year old, contributed to his decision to study landscape architecture and urban planning. This continue to inform his ideas - solutions to what is now acknowledged as the climate crisis must be sought on a large scale.

Nathalie de Vries cites De Stijl, the Dutch museum director Franks Haks, and Mecanoo´s housing and neighbourhood projects as influences. Mecanoo would be where de Vries began her professional career.

==Architectural language==
The variety of design choices in their buildings demonstrate that MVRDV wishes not to develop a specific style of architecture, but to provide and develop different methods in designing architecture and urban space. Projects are developed by interdisciplinary teams that test different possibilities rather than designing &quot;top-down&quot;. Over the years, this strategy led to the development of an architectural language that helps in explaining design choices to others.

The exhibition &quot;&quot;Architecture speaks&quot; – The Language of MVRDV&quot; was an opportunity for &quot;MVRDV&quot; to present four conceptual themes to describe their work. The exhibition was shown in the &quot;aut&quot;, an architectural centre in the Tyrol region of Innsbruck, Austria and was curated by Natalie de Vries.

* &quot;stack&quot;: This refers to the ever growing demand in space as well as the approach to stack and connect functions vertically, to create a three-dimensional space. This method came into use for the &quot;Berlinvoids&quot; design, where the office saw an opportunity to renew the standard way to deal with densification.
* &quot;pixel&quot;: The term &quot;pixel&quot; deals with the boundaries of space and provides the smallest unit in an agglomeration of units. It was initially developed as a measuring tool for the offices software &quot;The Function mixer&quot; and transformed into a flexible form that is adapted to the needs of its function.
* &quot;village&quot;: With the manifestation of the term village, MVRDV takes the next step into not only wanting to develop the immediate building but also the context. They use the &quot;village&quot; to be an example for ideal homes and neighbourhoods that can work as a basis for &quot;healthy community-making&quot;(DeVries, 2019).
* &quot;activator&quot;: Spaces that engage social interaction are referred to as &quot;activators&quot;. These projects provide structures that exceed habitable use, being descriptive of the social interaction process rather than the formalistic character of the structure itself.

==Notable works==
=== Valley, Amsterdam, Netherlands ===

Winner of the Emporis Skyscraper Award, Valley is a mixed-use, semi-publicly accessible development in the Zuidas business district of Amsterdam. Comprising three towers of heights ranging from 67 to 100 metres tall, it combines offices, shops, catering, cultural facilities, and apartments in one building. Described as “an oasis in a business district dominated by regular office buildings” a green valley winds between the fourth and fifth floors, wholly accessible via two stone external staircases. 
=== Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, Netherlands ===

MVRDV won the design competition for the depot in 2013, for which the assignment was to offer a glimpse behind the scenes of the museum world and make the whole art collection accessible to the public. The world’s first publicly accessible art storage facility and a 2023 Architectural Digest “Work of Wonder”, the depot displays more than 150,000 works of art and design that the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen previously had no room to exhibit. In addition to the significant amount of storage space required for art and design works, the depot comprises exhibition halls, a rooftop garden, and a restaurant.
=== Tianjin Binhai Library, Tianjin, China ===

Nicknamed “The Eye”, the Tianjin Binhai Library is part of the Binhai Cultural Center, and MVRDV&#x27;s second complered project in the Chinese municipality. A five-level library possessing a total floor space of 33,700 square metres, it features floor-to-ceiling terraced bookshelves able to hold 1.2 million books, with a 110-capacity auditorium set in a central sphere. According to Newsweek’s culture writer, Anna Menta, the library is “breathtaking” and “every book lover’s dream.” This was MVRDV&#x27;s fastest realised project to date, taking only three years from the first sketch to the opening.

==Current Projects==
As of 2023, MVRDV&#x27;s current projects include:

=== Europe ===
=== Americas ===
=== Asia ===
==Gallery==
== Awards ==
MVRDV has won awards across multiple architectural categories including housing, public buildings, commercial buildings, mixed-used developments, interior design, exterior design, and landscape architecture. Notable accolades include the RIBA House of the Year (Public Vote), European Museum of the Year Jury Prize, Emporis Skyscraper Award, ArchDaily Building of the Year, Prix Versailles, International Architecture Award, Architizer A+ Award, and Red Dot Design Award. MVRDV&#x27;s work has been exhibited in multiple locations including Gallery MA, Tokyo; Het Nieuwe Instituut, Rotterdam; ArchiLib Gallery, Paris;, Kyoto Global Design Awards - Environmental Design category and Architektur Galerie, Berlin.

== Criticism ==
MVRDV&#x27;s rise to that of a significant force within the architecture industry has been accompanied by critical voices. The Markthal in Rotterdam, despite winning several awards, did not 
meet with universal acclaim. Rob Bevan of &quot;Architectural Review&quot; described it as being part of an overall mistaken preference in Rotterdam for a &quot;stodgy diet of instant icons&quot; and indicative of &quot;noodle-headed re-shaping and architectural gymnastics&quot;, the implication being that more modest designs as part of a more integrated city-wide planning would create more successful buildings, although Bevan tempered his criticism in acknowledging that &quot;There is curiosity value then in MVRDV’s immovable feast with its seemingly calculated &quot;jolie laide&quot; proportions and it has brought vigour to a corner of the city demanding it&quot;.

The urban and architectural geographer Mark Minkjan expressed a belief that contemporary architects often serve as makeup artists of sales pitches, or producers of visually pleasing &quot;eye candies&quot; using MVRDV&#x27;s &quot;Valley&quot; to illustrate his view. As a case study, he made a specific critique of the renderings of Valley, an MVRDV project located in an emerging business district of Amsterdam and subsequently named the world&#x27;s best skyscraper in the 2021 Emporis Awards. Minkjan saw the renderings as cosmetic, deceptive images that hid the environmental, financial challenges that would occur during and after the building&#x27;s construction, saying &quot;In reality ... the building will never turn out like the rendering&quot;. Furthermore, despite &quot;Valley&#x27;s&quot; commercial spaces receiving BREEAM &quot;Excellent&quot; certification, the building&#x27;s energy performance being 30% better than local regulations require, and the residential area scoring 8 out of 10 on the GPR Building Scale, Minkjan nonetheless accuses the office of greenwashing, stating his view that the unrealistic illustration of rooftop gardens and terraces, which ignore the effects of smog, wind, poor soil and changing seasons, deflect attention from the sizeable emissions of the building construction. Minkjan&#x27;s criticism notwithstanding, &quot;Valley&quot; has been positively received, and garden designer Piet Oudolf worked with MVRDV on the building, using around 13,500 plants in 370 planting areas over 27 floors.

MVRDV&#x27;s design of the Marble Arch Mound in London was not well received. Critics named the creation of an artificial hill around and over London&#x27;s Marble Arch to be pointless, a massive waste of time and material, a pile of rubble, and London&#x27;s worst attraction. MVRDV acknowledged the poor architectural result but also pointed to Westminster City Council for watering down their design, excluding the studio from overseeing the construction, and ignoring their advice.

== Research ==

=== The Why Factory ===
The Why Factory is a global think tank and research institute at Delft University of Technology, led by professor Winy Maas. Its research revolves around analyzing urban developments and providing scenarios for future cities and societies. There is particular focus on opening engaging the public in architectural debate through exhibitions, workshops, publications and panel discussions. Founded in 2007, the think tank also provides an experimental outlook on the urban landscape of the future by exploring imaginary narratives and their interlinked new social contexts. To develop scenarios further, the Why Factory also uses computational design tools for analyzing and generating these concepts.

<doc id="892796" wikidata="Q2599085" url="?curid=892796" title="Gwyddelwern">
<text>Gwyddelwern is a small village and community of 508 residents, reducing to 500 at the 2011 census, situated approximately north of Corwen in Denbighshire in Wales. Historically the village was part of the Edeyrnion district of Meirionnydd. Edeyrnion was part of the Glyndŵr district of Clwyd from 1974 to 1996, when the area became part of the principal area of Denbighshire. The village straddles the A494 road (trunk road).

==Etymology==
The name is often &quot;poetically&quot;, but incorrectly, translated as &quot;The Irishman&#x27;s Alder Grove&quot;. &quot;Gwyddel&quot; being &quot;Irishman&quot;, &quot;wern&quot; usually referring to a &quot;damp&quot; or &quot;swampy area&quot; arising from run-off from surrounding hills. However, the name is derived from &quot;gwyddeli&quot;, meaning &quot;thickets&quot;, hence the correct translation would be &quot;alder marsh in the thickets&quot;. In colloquial speech the village is often referred to simply as Gwyddel.

==Geography==
The outlook to the west of the village is dominated by the hills Mynydd-Rhŷd-Ddu and Bryn Gwenallt. To the south the view extends over the Dee Valley to the Berwyn Mountains and Arenig Fawr near Bala.

Besides farm work, local employers include a saw mill in the village and light manufacturing in Corwen and Cynwyd, further south.

==History==

The nearby hamlet of Bryn Saith Marchog (), features in the story of Branwen, daughter of Llyr, part of the Mabinogion, and is so named after Bendigeidfran (Bran the Blessed), who stationed seven princes or knights there (the &quot;Saith Marchog&quot;) to watch over his lands while he was away in Ireland. 

The Lordship of Gwyddelwern was a junior title within the Princely House of Powys Fadog and was recorded in 1400 as being held by Tudur ap Gruffudd, son of Gruffydd Fychan II, who was the younger brother of Prince Owain Glyndŵr. 

Tudur perished in battle during Glyndŵr&#x27;s war of independence and the title became dormant. His grandson, Ellis ap Griffith, husband of Margaret, the heiress of Plas yn Yale, would later succeed Tudur to the Lordship of Gwyddelwern and become Baron of Gwyddelwern.

In 1550, Gwyddelwern absorbed the neighboring parish of Llanaelhaiarn (named after its founder and patron saint Aelhaiarn, who visited the region in the early 7th century with his master Saint Beuno); a small village at the site was long also known as Aelhaiarn but was eventually replaced by the small community of Pandy&#x27;r Capel.

During the English Civil War a significant part of the village sided with the Royalist Cause - or at least enough people for the village to be required to give financial retribution. At the end of 1649 at least 20 men from the village were fined by the Parliamentarian side for &quot;delinquency&quot; to pay for their involvement fighting for the king. This included a heavy fine of £28 for Peter Meyrick at Ucheldref Farm.

Quarrying was important to Gwyddelwern: the two local quarries being the Dee Clwyd Granite Quarry and Graig Lelo Quarry. There is still activity at Graig Lelo, which plays host to a vehicle breakers and a granite and marble finishing business.

===The Coming and Going of the Railways===

Gwyddelwern became the first full-operational railway station in the Vale of Edeyrnion, when services started on 22 September 22, 1864 with the opening of the Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway. The station generated much income from the two quarries, which both had their own sidings. The station also had a coal yard, horse loading bay and cattle pens with a weighing machine. There was a freight loop at Gwyddelwern, on the otherwise single track line.

Passenger services ended on 2 February 1953 and goods traffic on 2 December 1957.

===Architecture===

Gwyddelwern&#x27;s historic architecture includes the much-rebuilt high spire of the parish church of St Beuno. The churchyard is circular, an indication of the age of the site, possibly to pre Christian times.

Which shares a boundary with the local inn - Tŷ Mawr, formerly the Rose and Crown. Parts of Tŷ Mawr date back to the 11th century and, during extensive renovation, a rare jeton or 15th century gaming token was found in one of the wall spaces.

<text>Quantum error correction (QEC) is a set of techniques used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Quantum error correction is theorised as essential to achieve fault tolerant quantum computing that can reduce the effects of noise on stored quantum information, faulty quantum gates, faulty quantum state preparation, and faulty measurements. Effective quantum error correction would allow quantum computers with low qubit fidelity to execute algorithms of higher complexity or greater circuit depth.

Classical error correction often employs redundancy. The simplest albeit inefficient approach is the repetition code. A repetition code stores the desired (logical) information as multiple copies, and—if these copies are later found to disagree due to errors introduced to the system—determines the most likely value for the original data by majority vote. For instance, suppose we copy a bit in the one (on) state three times. Suppose further that noise in the system introduces an error that corrupts the three-bit state so that one of the copied bits becomes zero (off) but the other two remain equal to one. Assuming that errors are independent and occur with some sufficiently low probability &quot;p&quot;, it is most likely that the error is a single-bit error and the intended message is three bits in the one state. It is possible that a double-bit error occurs and the transmitted message is equal to three zeros, but this outcome is less likely than the above outcome. In this example, the logical information is a single bit in the one state and the physical information are the three duplicate bits. Creating a physical state that represents the logical state is called &quot;encoding&quot; and determining which logical state is encoded in the physical state is called &quot;decoding&quot;. Similar to classical error correction, QEC codes do not always correctly decode logical qubits, but instead reduce the effect of noise on the logical state.

Copying quantum information is not possible due to the no-cloning theorem. This theorem seems to present an obstacle to formulating a theory of quantum error correction. But it is possible to &quot;spread&quot; the (logical) information of one logical qubit onto a highly entangled state of several (physical) qubits. Peter Shor first discovered this method of formulating a &quot;quantum error correcting code&quot; by storing the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of nine qubits.

In classical error correction, &quot;syndrome decoding&quot; is used to diagnose which error was the likely source of corruption on an encoded state. An error can then be reversed by applying a corrective operation based on the syndrome. Quantum error correction also employs syndrome measurements. It performs a multi-qubit measurement that does not disturb the quantum information in the encoded state but retrieves information about the error. Depending on the QEC code used, syndrome measurement can determine the occurrence, location and type of errors. In most QEC codes, the type of error is either a bit flip, or a sign (of the phase) flip, or both (corresponding to the Pauli matrices X, Z, and Y). The measurement of the syndrome has the projective effect of a quantum measurement, so even if the error due to the noise was arbitrary, it can be expressed as a combination of basis operations called the error basis (which is given by the Pauli matrices and the identity). To correct the error, the Pauli operator corresponding to the type of error is used on the corrupted qubit to revert the effect of the error.

The syndrome measurement provides information about the error that has happened, but not about the information that is stored in the logical qubit—as otherwise the measurement would destroy any quantum superposition of this logical qubit with other qubits in the quantum computer, which would prevent it from being used to convey quantum information.

==Bit-flip code==

The repetition code works in a classical channel, because classical bits are easy to measure and to repeat. This approach does not work for a quantum channel in which, due to the no-cloning theorem, it is not possible to repeat a single qubit three times. To overcome this, a different method has to be used, such as the &quot;three-qubit bit-flip code&quot; first proposed by Asher Peres in 1985. This technique uses entanglement and syndrome measurements and is comparable in performance with the repetition code.
Consider the situation in which we want to transmit the state of a single qubit formula_1 through a noisy channel formula_2. Let us moreover assume that this channel either flips the state of the qubit, with probability formula_3, or leaves it unchanged. The action of formula_2 on a general input formula_5 can therefore be written as formula_6.

Let formula_7 be the quantum state to be transmitted. With no error-correcting protocol in place, the transmitted state will be correctly transmitted with probability formula_8. We can however improve on this number by &quot;encoding&quot; the state into a greater number of qubits, in such a way that errors in the corresponding logical qubits can be detected and corrected. In the case of the simple three-qubit repetition code, the encoding consists in the mappings formula_9 and formula_10. The input state formula_1 is encoded into the state formula_12. This mapping can be realized for example using two CNOT gates, entangling the system with two ancillary qubits initialized in the state formula_13. The encoded state formula_14 is what is now passed through the noisy channel.

The channel acts on formula_14 by flipping some subset (possibly empty) of its qubits. No qubit is flipped with probability formula_16, a single qubit is flipped with probability formula_17, two qubits are flipped with probability formula_18, and all three qubits are flipped with probability formula_19. Note that a further assumption about the channel is made here: we assume that formula_2 acts equally and independently on each of the three qubits in which the state is now encoded. The problem is now how to detect and correct such errors, while not corrupting the transmitted state&quot;.&quot;

Let us assume for simplicity that formula_3 is small enough that the probability of more than a single qubit being flipped is negligible. One can then detect whether a qubit was flipped, without also querying for the values being transmitted, by asking whether one of the qubits differs from the others. This amounts to performing a measurement with four different outcomes, corresponding to the following four projective measurements:formula_22This reveals which qubits are different from the others, without at the same time giving information about the state of the qubits themselves. If the outcome corresponding to formula_23 is obtained, no correction is applied, while if the outcome corresponding to formula_24 is observed, then the Pauli &quot;X&quot; gate is applied to the formula_25-th qubit. Formally, this correcting procedure corresponds to the application of the following map to the output of the channel:
formula_26

Note that, while this procedure perfectly corrects the output when zero or one flips are introduced by the channel, if more than one qubit is flipped then the output is not properly corrected. For example, if the first and second qubits are flipped, then the syndrome measurement gives the outcome formula_27, and the third qubit is flipped, instead of the first two. To assess the performance of this error-correcting scheme for a general input we can study the fidelity formula_28 between the input formula_14 and the output formula_30. Being the output state formula_31 correct when no more than one qubit is flipped, which happens with probability formula_32, we can write it as formula_33, where the dots denote components of formula_31 resulting from errors not properly corrected by the protocol. It follows that formula_35This fidelity is to be compared with the corresponding fidelity obtained when no error-correcting protocol is used, which was shown before to equal formula_36. A little algebra then shows that the fidelity &quot;after&quot; error correction is greater than the one without for formula_37. Note that this is consistent with the working assumption that was made while deriving the protocol (of formula_3 being small enough).

==Sign-flip code==

The bit flip is the only kind of error in classical computers. In quantum computers, however, another kind of error is possible: the sign flip. Through transmission in a channel, the relative sign between formula_39 and formula_40 can become inverted. For instance, a qubit in the state formula_41 may have its sign flip to formula_42

The original state of the qubit
formula_43
will be changed into the state
formula_44

In the Hadamard basis, bit flips become sign flips and sign flips become bit flips. Let formula_45 be a quantum channel that can cause at most one phase flip. Then the bit-flip code from above can recover formula_46 by transforming into the Hadamard basis before and after transmission through formula_45.

==Shor code==

The error channel may induce either a bit flip, a sign flip (i.e., a phase flip), or both. It is possible to correct for both types of errors on a logical qubit using a well-designed QEC code. One example of a code that does this is the Shor code, published in 1995. Since these two types of errors are the only types of errors that can result after a projective measurement, a Shor code corrects arbitrary single-qubit errors.
Let formula_48 be a quantum channel that can arbitrarily corrupt a single qubit. The 1st, 4th and 7th qubits are for the sign flip code, while the three groups of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are designed for the bit flip code. With the Shor code, a qubit state formula_49 will be transformed into the product of 9 qubits formula_50, where
formula_51
formula_52

If a bit flip error happens to a qubit, the syndrome analysis will be performed on each block of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) to detect and correct at most one bit flip error in each block.

If the three bit flip group (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are considered as three inputs, then the Shor code circuit can be reduced as a sign flip code. This means that the Shor code can also repair a sign flip error for a single qubit.

The Shor code also can correct for any arbitrary errors (both bit flip and sign flip) to a single qubit. If an error is modeled by a unitary transform U, which will act on a qubit formula_46, then formula_54 can be described in the form
formula_55
where formula_56,formula_57,formula_58, and formula_59 are complex constants, I is the identity, and the Pauli matrices are given by
formula_60

If &quot;U&quot; is equal to &quot;I&quot;, then no error occurs. If formula_61, a bit flip error occurs. If formula_62, a sign flip error occurs. If formula_63 then both a bit flip error and a sign flip error occur. In other words, the Shor code can correct any combination of bit or phase errors on a single qubit.

More generally, the error operator &quot;U&quot; does not need to be unitary, but can be an Kraus operator from a quantum operation representing a system interacting with its environment.

== Bosonic codes ==
Several proposals have been made for storing error-correctable quantum information in bosonic modes. Unlike a two-level system, a quantum harmonic oscillator has infinitely many energy levels in a single physical system. Codes for these systems include cat, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP), and binomial codes. One insight offered by these codes is to take advantage of the redundancy within a single system, rather than to duplicate many two-level qubits.

=== Binomial code ===
Written in the Fock basis, the simplest binomial encoding is
formula_64
where the subscript L indicates a &quot;logically encoded&quot; state. Then if the dominant error mechanism of the system is the stochastic application of the bosonic lowering operator formula_65 the corresponding error states are formula_66 and formula_67 respectively. Since the codewords involve only even photon number, and the error states involve only odd photon number, errors can be detected by measuring the photon number parity of the system. Measuring the odd parity will allow correction by application of an appropriate unitary operation without knowledge of the specific logical state of the qubit. However, the particular binomial code above is not robust to two-photon loss.

===Cat code===
Schrödinger cat states, superpositions of coherent states, can also be used as logical states for error correction codes. Cat code, realized by Ofek et al. in 2016, defined two sets of logical states: formula_68 and formula_69, where each of the states is a superposition of coherent state as follows

formula_70

Those two sets of states differ from the photon number parity, as states denoted with formula_71 only occupy even photon number states and states with formula_72 indicate they have odd parity. Similar to the binomial code, if the dominant error mechanism of the system is the stochastic application of the bosonic lowering operator formula_73, the error takes the logical states from the even parity subspace to the odd one, and vice versa. Single-photon-loss errors can therefore be detected by measuring the photon number parity operator formula_74 using a dispersively coupled ancillary qubit.

Still, cat qubits are not protected against two-photon loss formula_75, dephasing noise formula_76, photon-gain error formula_77, etc.

==General codes==
In general, a &quot;quantum code&quot; for a quantum channel formula_78 is a subspace formula_79, where formula_80 is the state Hilbert space, such that there exists another quantum channel formula_81 with
formula_82
where formula_83 is the orthogonal projection onto formula_84. Here formula_81 is known as the &quot;correction operation&quot;.

A &quot;non-degenerate code&quot; is one for which different elements of the set of correctable errors produce linearly independent results when applied to elements of the code. If distinct of the set of correctable errors produce orthogonal results, the code is considered &quot;pure&quot;.

==Models==

Over time, researchers have come up with several codes:

* Peter Shor&#x27;s 9-qubit-code, a.k.a. the Shor code, encodes 1 logical qubit in 9 physical qubits and can correct for arbitrary errors in a single qubit.
* Andrew Steane found a code that does the same with 7 instead of 9 qubits, see Steane code.
* Raymond Laflamme and collaborators found a class of 5-qubit codes that do the same, which also have the property of being fault-tolerant. A 5-qubit code is the smallest possible code that protects a single logical qubit against single-qubit errors.
* A generalisation of the technique used by Steane, to develop the 7-qubit code from the classical [7, 4] Hamming code, led to the construction of an important class of codes called the CSS codes, named for their inventors: Robert Calderbank, Peter Shor and Andrew Steane. According to the quantum Hamming bound, encoding a single logical qubit and providing for arbitrary error correction in a single qubit requires a minimum of 5 physical qubits.
* A more general class of codes (encompassing the former) are the stabilizer codes discovered by Daniel Gottesman, and by Robert Calderbank, Eric Rains, Peter Shor, and N. J. A. Sloane; these are also called additive codes.
*Two dimensional Bacon–Shor codes are a family of codes parameterized by integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. There are &quot;nm&quot; qubits arranged in a square lattice. 
* Alexei Kitaev&#x27;s topological quantum codes, introduced in 1997 as the toric code, and the more general idea of a topological quantum computer are the basis for various code types.
* Todd Brun, Igor Devetak, and Min-Hsiu Hsieh also constructed the entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism as an extension of the standard stabilizer formalism that incorporates quantum entanglement shared between a sender and a receiver.
* The ideas of stabilizer codes, CSS codes, and topological codes can be expanded into the 2D planar surface code, of which various types exist. As of June 2024, the 2D planar surface code is generally considered the most well-studied type of quantum error correction, and one of the leading contenders for practical use in quantum computing.

That these codes allow indeed for quantum computations of arbitrary length is the content of the quantum threshold theorem, found by Michael Ben-Or and Dorit Aharonov, which asserts that you can correct for all errors if you concatenate quantum codes such as the CSS codes—i.e. re-encode each logical qubit by the same code again, and so on, on logarithmically many levels—&quot;provided&quot; that the error rate of individual quantum gates is below a certain threshold; as otherwise, the attempts to measure the syndrome and correct the errors would introduce more new errors than they correct for.

As of late 2004, estimates for this threshold indicate that it could be as high as 1–3%, provided that there are sufficiently many qubits available.

==Experimental realization==
There have been several experimental realizations of CSS-based codes. The first demonstration was with nuclear magnetic resonance qubits. Subsequently, demonstrations have been made with linear optics, trapped ions, and superconducting (transmon) qubits.

In 2016 for the first time the lifetime of a quantum bit was prolonged by employing a QEC code. The error-correction demonstration was performed on Schrödinger-cat states encoded in a superconducting resonator, and employed a quantum controller capable of performing real-time feedback operations including read-out of the quantum information, its analysis, and the correction of its detected errors. The work demonstrated how the quantum-error-corrected system reaches the break-even point at which the lifetime of a logical qubit exceeds the lifetime of the underlying constituents of the system (the physical qubits).

Other error correcting codes have also been implemented, such as one aimed at correcting for photon loss, the dominant error source in photonic qubit schemes.

In 2021, an entangling gate between two logical qubits encoded in topological quantum error-correction codes has first been realized using 10 ions in a trapped-ion quantum computer. 2021 also saw the first experimental demonstration of fault-tolerant Bacon-Shor code in a single logical qubit of a trapped-ion system, i.e. a demonstration for which the addition of error correction is able to suppress more errors than is introduced by the overhead required to implement the error correction as well as fault tolerant Steane code.

In 2022, researchers at the University of Innsbruck have demonstrated a fault-tolerant universal set of gates on two logical qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer. They have performed a logical two-qubit controlled-NOT gate between two instances of the seven-qubit colour code, and fault-tolerantly prepared a logical magic state.

In February 2023, researchers at Google claimed to have decreased quantum errors by increasing the qubit number in experiments, they used a fault tolerant surface code measuring an error rate of 3.028% and 2.914% for a distance-3 qubit array and a distance-5 qubit array respectively.

In April 2024, researchers at Microsoft claimed to have successfully tested a quantum error correction code that allowed them to achieve an error rate with logical qubits that is 800 times better than the underlying physical error rate.

This qubit virtualization system was used to create 4 logical qubits with 30 of the 32 qubits on Quantinuum&#x27;s trapped-ion hardware. The system uses an active syndrome extraction technique to diagnose errors and correct them while calculations are underway without destroying the logical qubits.

In January 2025, researchers at UNSW Sydney managed to develop an error correction method using antimony-based materials, including antimonides, leveraging high-dimensional quantum states (qudits) with up to eight states. By encoding quantum information in the nuclear spin of a phosphorus atom embedded in silicon and employing advanced pulse control techniques, they demonstrated enhanced error resilience.

== Quantum error correction without encoding and parity checks ==
In 2022, research at University of Engineering and Technology Lahore demonstrated error cancellation by inserting single-qubit Z-axis rotation gates into strategically chosen locations of the superconductor quantum circuits. The scheme has been shown to effectively correct errors that would otherwise rapidly add up under constructive interference of coherent noise. This is a circuit-level calibration scheme that traces deviations (e.g. sharp dips or notches) in the decoherence curve to detect and localize the coherent error, but does not require encoding or parity measurements. However, further investigation is needed to establish the effectiveness of this method for the incoherent noise.

<doc id="892807" wikidata="Q1702537" url="?curid=892807" title="Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001">
<text>The Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, is the official name of the inquiry conducted by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence into the activities of the U.S. Intelligence Community in connection with the attacks of September 11, 2001. The investigation began in February 2002 and the final report was released in December 2002.

==Calls for inquiry==
The White House, Senator Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and Representative Porter Goss (R-Fla.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, originally rebuffed calls for an inquiry following the September 11 attacks. After December 2001, initial resolutions in the Senate called for the establishment of an independent bipartisan commission. The joint inquiry was announced February 14, 2002, with Senator Graham saying it would not play &quot;the blame game about what went wrong from an intelligence perspective&quot;, and Representative Goss saying, &quot;This particular effort focuses on the broader issues of terrorism worldwide, our capacity to counter terrorist activities and our preparedness to protect the American people at home and abroad.&quot;

==Investigation==
Senator Graham and Representative Goss, accompanied by their respective committee ranking minority members, Republican Senator Richard C. Shelby and Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi, led the joint inquiry. L. Britt Snider, the former inspector general of the CIA, was staff director. He hired a 30-person investigative staff to gather evidence and interview Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

However, the committee quickly ran into stonewalling, delays and attacks from Vice President Dick Cheney and United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, especially after an alleged leak from the committee. CNN had reported classified information that the National Security Agency had received warning of the attacks on September 10 but failed to translate and forward them. Staff director L. Britt Snider was pressured to resign in April 2002 because of questions about whether one or more of his hires had lacked proper clearance to view classified material.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in May 2002 that Representative Goss dismissed as &quot;a lot of nonsense&quot; reports that five weeks before the attacks a CIA briefing had alerted President Bush about possible Osama bin Laden associates&#x27; plans to highjack aircraft; he said the investigation focus would be on why the United States intelligence bureaucracy composed of 13 agencies failed to detect the hijackers. Senator Graham said the question was why wasn&#x27;t the intelligence precise. Critics on and off of Capitol Hill complained that Goss was too aligned with the CIA and Graham was insufficiently assertive.

In August 2002 unnamed individuals who had read the report revealed it contained accusations of links between the government of Saudi Arabia and the attacks. The Saudis denied this and asked that the section be made public, but President Bush refused. In December 2002 Senator Graham himself revealed in a PBS interview that &quot;I was surprised at the evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the United States.&quot;

==The report==
The joint inquiry released their findings in December 2002. The 832-page report (available as both S. Rept. 107-351 and H. Rept. 107-792) presents the joint inquiry’s findings and conclusions, an accompanying narrative, and a series of recommendations. The critical and comprehensive report detailed failings of the FBI and CIA to use available information, including about terrorists the CIA knew were in the United States, in order to disrupt the plots.

===Redacted sections===

&quot;The 28 pages&quot; refers to a small section at the end of the inquiry commission report on the September 11 attacks that includes the details of foreign state sponsor support for al-Qaeda prior to the attack and the possible Saudi connection with the terrorists. This part of the congressional report was classified by the George W. Bush administration. Since then, attempts were made to declassify the redacted pages by senators and political activists, among them former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the co-chairman of the joint congressional panel, Bob Graham. United States&#x27; intelligence agencies declassified the pages, and Congress publicly released the pages with some parts redacted on July 15, 2016.

==Aftermath==
September 11 victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material and demanded an independent commission. In late 2002, President George W. Bush and Congress established the 9/11 Commission, an independent bipartisan commission charged with investigating the September 11 attacks.

In 2004, Senator Graham released his book &quot;Intelligence Matters: The CIA, the FBI, Saudi Arabia, and the Failure of America&#x27;s War on Terror&quot; that dealt with issues raised by the investigation. In April 2016, both co-chairmen of the Inquiry, Bob Graham and Porter Goss, later director of the CIA, as well as other former U.S. officials, who are familiar with the entire text of the joint inquiry′s report, aired their belief that the U.S. government was persisting in its coverup on the Saudi Arabian government officials′ substantial aid provided to the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack and urged the Obama administration to declassify the bowdlerized pages of the report. A bipartisan effort led by Walter Jones and Stephen Lynch seeks to make the document fully available to the public. Questions are likely to persist even if the &quot;28 pages&quot; are released.

In 2015, efforts began in the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that would allow victims to sue foreign powers that fund terrorist groups, such as Al Qaeda, to kill Americans on American soil. This bill became law on September 28, 2016, as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.

<text>Frederick &quot;Cy&quot; Williams (December 21, 1887 – April 23, 1974) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder for the Chicago Cubs (1912–17) and Philadelphia Phillies (1918–30). As Major League Baseball emerged from the dead-ball era, Williams became one of the most prominent home run hitters in the National League.

==Baseball career==
Born in Wadena, Indiana, Williams attended Notre Dame where he studied architecture and played football with Knute Rockne. His hitting prowess caught the attention of the Chicago Cubs, who purchased his contract after he graduated from college. Williams made his major league debut with the Cubs on July 18, 1912 at the age of 24. From 1915 to 1927 he was a consistent power hitting center fielder, leading the National League in home runs four times during his career.

Williams was the first National League player to hit 200 career home runs, and is one of three players born before 1900 to hit 200 homers in his career (Babe Ruth and Rogers Hornsby are the others). He was the National League&#x27;s career home run leader until his record of 251 was surpassed by Hornsby in 1929.

In a 19-year major league career, Williams played in 2,002 games, accumulating 1,981 hits in 6,780 at bats for a .292 career batting average along with 251 home runs, 1,005 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .365. He hit over .300 six times in his career. An excellent defensive player, Williams had a .973 career fielding percentage, which was nine points higher than the league average during his playing career.

Williams was also an effective pinch-hitter in his major league career, batting .287 (48-167) with 10 home runs and 41 RBI in that role.

The Williams Shift, in which defensive players moved to the right side of the playing field, is often associated with Ted Williams, but it was actually first employed against Cy Williams during the 1920s. He played in his final major league game on September 22, 1930 at the age of 42. In 1931, Williams served as a player-manager in the minor leagues for the Richmond Byrds of the Eastern League.

==Later life==
After retirement, Williams worked as an architect at the 3 Lakes Theatre in Three Lakes, Wisconsin beginning in 1949. Before that, he designed the 3 Lakes Theatre&#x27;s exterior and interior and later opened that June of the same year.

<text>Helijet International is a helicopter airline and charter service based in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. Its scheduled passenger helicopter airline services operates flights from heliports at Vancouver International Airport (YVR), downtown Vancouver, downtown Nanaimo and downtown Victoria. It also operates a charter division (Helijet Charters) serving the film, television, aerial tour, industrial and general helicopter and corporate jet charter markets, as well as helicopter and jet air ambulance services. Its head office and main hangar is Vancouver International Airport (YVR).

Sightseeing harbour and city tours and scheduled services to Victoria and Nanaimo operate from the Vancouver Harbour Heliport located on the shores of Burrard Inlet, adjacent to Waterfront Station. The actual heliport is a floating structure located in the harbour waters. Helijet is also British Columbia&#x27;s largest air medical service provider, operating rotary wing, fixed wing medevac aircraft including Learjet.

==History==
The airline was established in 1986 as Helijet Airways and started operations between Vancouver and Victoria in November 1986 with one Bell 412 helicopter and 14 staff members. During the past 30 years of operation, Helijet has grown from one aircraft in scheduled service with 14 personnel carrying just 22,000 passengers into a diversified company with 15 aircraft and 150+ employees carrying over 100,000 passengers per year. The company has an excellent record of aviation safety. With US Helicopter now defunct in the New York City area since 2009, Helijet and BLADE Urban Air Mobility Inc. are the only scheduled passenger helicopter airline service in North America.

In the past, Helijet provided scheduled passenger services with Sikorsky S-76 helicopters or Beechcraft 1900 turboprop fixed-wing aircraft to Seattle-Boeing Field, Abbotsford International Airport, Langley Regional Airport, Victoria International Airport and Campbell River Airport, all of which are still destinations accessible by Helijet Charters&#x27; services. Helijet has operated large, 19 passenger seat Sikorsky S-61 helicopters as well including in scheduled service between Vancouver and Victoria.

All scheduled passenger services between the company&#x27;s heliports located in downtown Vancouver, B.C. and downtown Victoria, B.C. have been operated for many years with twin engine, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) capable Sikorsky S-76 helicopters flown by two pilots. During the 2013 summer season, all scheduled service between Vancouver and Victoria was being operated with Bell 206L-3 LongRanger III turbine powered rotorcraft. However, with the advent of the 2013 fall season, Helijet was once again operating Sikorsky S-76 helicopters between Vancouver and Victoria and is currently doing so.

Helijet International operates the Vancouver and Victoria Harbour Heliports under its wholly owned subsidiary, Pacific Heliport Services.

Helijet also operates a year-round base at Sandspit Airport and provides helicopter services between Masset Airport and numerous fishing lodges in the Haida Gwaii area during the BC fishing season. The fishing lodges have an operating helipad to facilitate this service, which includes passenger and cargo transfers.

On March 11, 2015, Helijet began operating new scheduled passenger service utilizing Sikorsky S-76 helicopters with seven roundtrip flights every weekday between the company&#x27;s downtown heliport located in Vancouver Harbour and the Nanaimo Harbour Heliport located at the Nanaimo Cruise Ship Welcome Centre.

<doc id="892819" wikidata="Q6045755" url="?curid=892819" title="Intercity Shopping Centre">
<text>Intercity Shopping Centre is a shopping mall in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. It was one of the first shopping malls in Thunder Bay and is the largest of its kind in Northwestern Ontario, with of retail space.

Originally, Intercity was built as a strip mall in 1982. However, in the 1990s, the entire Intercity site was redesigned. The strip mall was demolished and a more modern mall was constructed. Since then, the mall has seen various anchor stores and changes over the years. Today, it is Thunder Bay’s dominant shopping mall.

==Description==

The mall is located in the middle of Thunder Bay, in the heart of the Intercity Neighbourhood. The mall is surrounded by the Harbour Expressway to the North, Fort William Road on the east, Isabel Street to the south, and Memorial Avenue to the west. By the main entrance, Thunder Bay Transit has a 2-platform bus hub, served by routes 1, 3M, 8, 9, and 12 when the mall is open.

The mall is home to dozens of shops. Shops range from clothing shops, to hair salons, to electronic shops, and more. The main entrance (on Fort William Road) leads to the food court on the south side of the mall. In addition, there is a second floor on the north side of the mall. This second floor is called the Office Galleria, and is home to several offices situated within the mall.

===Anchor Stores===
Today, there are 4 anchor stores within Intercity Shopping Centre. At the very south, is Dollarama. It has two entrances: one from Fort William Road, and the other from the mall. The southwest corner has Urban Planet, which can only be accessed by the mall. The west side of the mall is home to Sportchek, the only original anchor store remaining. It can be accessed from Memorial Avenue, or from the mall’s food court. At the very north, is Marshalls, accessible from the mall or Fort William Road.

The southernmost anchor store was originally Zellers from the opening of Intercity Mall until January 2013, when Zellers closed permanently. Renovations to this part of the mall began immediately, and a new Target store opened on 16 July 2013. Zellers and Target, both also had a third entrance at the corner of Memorial Avenue and Isabel Street. Like most Target stores in Canada, the Intercity location closed on 1 April 2015. In August 2016, Lowe&#x27;s had renovated this spot in the mall and was one of the mall&#x27;s anchor for several years. This location of Lowe’s had a garden centre on the west side of the store, and used the Memorial-Isabel entrance as their contractor’s entrance. In 2020, Lowe’s closed their Thunder Bay location and the south anchor was empty until Dollarama opened a store in the eastern half of the space in 2022. Thunder Bay Public Library intends on using the other half of the space to create a central library.

At the north end of the mall, Sears was the tenant of a 2-storey anchor store. They sold clothing and footwear on the lower level while furniture and home decor were sold on the upper level. Other than Thunder Bay Airport, Sears was the only other place in Thunder Bay to have escalators. There were three entrances, one from the mall, second from Fort William Road, and the third facing the Harbour Expressway. Finally, Sears Canada closed down in 2018, resulting in the closure of the Thunder Bay location too. Subsequently, Marshall’s moved into the space after renovations. However, Marshall’s is only occupying a fraction of the first floor, leaving the second storey of Sears and the northernmost space from Sears abandoned.

The southwest anchor store formerly was HomeSense. It relocated to Thunder Centre on the opposite side of Fort William Road on 20 March 2018. Following their relocation, Urban Planet has been located in that space. Sportchek, on the west side of the mall, is the only original anchor store that has not been changed.

===Food Court===
The main entrance (Entrance 1) on Fort William Road leads into a passage that leads to the food court. The food court leads to several fast food restaurants that serve the mall. They include:
* A&amp;W
* Feta &amp; Olives
* Manchu Wok
* Subway
* Sheffield Express
* Sam’s Kitchen
* Tim Hortons
* TacoTime
* New York Fries

 Rocky Mountain Chocolates is located on the north side of the mall instead. Freshly Squeezed used to be located in the centre of the food court but has since moved to a larger location in the middle of the mall.

The food court has a recycling and composting program. Instead of using garbage bins, all food waste is to be brought to a tray station in the centre. Customers bring their trash to the station and staff will sort recycling and compost and dispose of them sustainably.

==Thunder Bay Public Library==

Thunder Bay Public Library has shown an interest in acquiring space from the former Lowe’s space and making their central library. Currently, they have two main libraries located in the core of the two former cities of Port Arthur and Fort William. The creation of the Intercity library would see the consolidation of these libraries as the main library, leaving them to become neighborhood branches, much like County Fair and Mary J.L. Black branches are today. Currently, this development is in the consultation phase.

<doc id="892825" wikidata="Q3650634" url="?curid=892825" title="Julian Stanczak">
<text>Julian Stanczak ( ; November 5, 1928 – March 25, 2017) was a Polish-born American painter and printmaker who is considered a central figure of the Op art movement in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s. Described as an artist whose work &quot;evinced a tremendous geometric inventiveness&quot;, Stanczak is primarily known for his large-scale polychromatic abstract compositions made using acrylic paint on canvas in which he explored the perceptual dimensions of color.

Born in 1928 in Borownica, Poland, Stanczak survived a Siberian labor camp during World War II where he lost the use of his right arm. He retrained himself to paint left-handed and emigrated to the United States in 1950, where he eventually became a citizen. In 1956, Stanczak received an M.F.A. from Yale University, where he studied with Josef Albers and Conrad Marca-Relli, and was roommates with fellow abstract painter Richard Anuszkiewicz. The term &quot;Op art&quot;, since used to describe a short-lived movement of 1960s and 1970s, originated from Stanczak&#x27;s work when the Minimalist artist and sculptor Donald Judd used it in his critical review of the 1964 exhibition titled &quot;Julian Stanczak: Optical Paintings&quot; at Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. Stanczak achieved broader commercial recognition after being featured in the landmark 1965 exhibition &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; created by curator William C. Seitz at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

As the popularity of Op art diminished in the late 1970s, Stanczak remained active as a painter and continued to exhibit his work, but became progressively separated from mainstream contemporary art in the U.S. In addition to being a practicing artist, Stanczak served as a faculty member at the Art Academy of Cincinnati from 1957 to 1964 and, later, as Professor of Painting at the Cleveland Institute of Art from 1964 to 1995. In 2013, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. Stanczak lived and worked in Seven Hills, Ohio with his wife, the sculptor Barbara Stanczak, until his death in 2017. His work is included in permanent collections of museums in North America and Europe.

== Early life and work ==

=== Early life and education (1928-1950) ===

Julian Stanczak (Polish: Stańczak) was born in Borownica, Poland in 1928. In 1940, at the beginning of World War II, Stanczak and his family were forced into a Soviet labor camp in Perm, Siberia, where his right arm is seriously injured; he had been right-handed. In 1942, Stanczak together with his family successfully escaped from the camp. Aged sixteen, Stanczak decided to join the Polish Armed Forces in the West to receive food rations and medical help, becoming separated from his parents, sister, and brother. Realizing that he would permanently lose use of his right arm, Stanczak deserted. 

He then traveled to a refugee camp in Tehran where he joined his mother and siblings; his father had by that time gone missing. The family was then transported to a Polish refugee camp in Masindi, British Uganda. Stanczak remained there for six years. He received his first art lessons during that period from another Polish refugee named Henryk Frudist. Stanczak would later state that the time in Uganda had an important visual and artistic influence on his work; in particular, he found inspiration in geometric patterns of local textiles used by Ugandan women to make clothing, indigenous music, and East African fauna and flora, which he described as &quot;dazzling display&quot;. In 1948, Stanczak and his family moved to England where he enrolled at the Borough Polytechnic to study art. 

=== Immigration to the United States (1950) ===

The Stanczaks eventually immigrated to the United States in 1950 and permanently relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, where Stanczak would spend the rest of his life and career. Stanczak received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Cleveland Institute of Art, Cleveland Ohio in 1954, and then trained under Josef Albers and Conrad Marca-Relli at the Yale University, where he was roommates with Richard Anuszkiewicz who would later become one of the key artists associated with Op Art. Stanczak was a student of Albers for two years and was awarded a Master of Fine Arts from Yale University in 1956. 

Albers, who had formerly served as a faculty member at the Bauhaus and taught classes in color theory, served as an important influence for Stanczak and his &quot;work modeled the perceptual practices&quot; of Stanczak. According to the American scholar Joe Houston, the investigation of color became the primary interest of Stanczak and Anuszkiewicz while at Yale. In particular, Stanczak was inspired by the 1954 book by Rudolf Arnheim, a German Gestalt theorist with strong connections to the Bauhaus, titled &quot;Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye&quot;, which the artist translated into Polish. Writing in 1992, the &quot;Artforum&quot; critic Elizabeth Licata said that Stanczak&#x27;s precise linear systems operate within the visual rigor and limits set out by Albers who, according to Stanczak, &quot;taught by confrontation anxiety&quot;. In 1955, Stanczak&#x27;s paintings of &quot;an abstracted linear pattern&quot; were included in an annual exhibition of new art at the Cleveland Museum of Art, where he was awarded an honorary mention. He became a United States citizen in 1957 and taught at the Art Academy of Cincinnati for 7 years.

== Career in the U.S. ==

=== Op-art movement (1964-1970s) ===
The term op art was first coined by the American Minimalist artist Donald Judd in a review for &quot;Arts Magazine&quot; of &quot;Julian Stanczak: Optical Paintings&quot; held at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York in 1964. Judd described his paintings as &quot;primarily fields of narrow, vibrating stripes&quot; and compared them to the work of the British artist Bridget Riley before stating that optical effects &quot;are one thing, a narrow phenomenon, and color effects are another, a wide range. Op art&quot;. Critic Burton Wasserman would later describe the exhibition as a &quot;demonstration of lean plastic purity&quot;. In 1965, Stanczak&#x27;s work was included in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s landmark exhibition &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; curated by William C. Seitz. Although the show was poorly received by the critics, it proved popular with the general public and helped establish Op art as a distinct art movement, while many participating artists received substantial market recognition. According to art critic Christopher Bedford, &quot;the egalitarian address of Op art to our basic optical faculties serves Stanczak well, making his paintings as generous conceptually as they are experientially demanding&quot;. Stanczak, however, preferred to call his style &quot;perceptual art&quot; rather than &quot;optical&quot;. 

In 1966 he was named a &quot;New Talent&quot; by &quot;Art in America&quot; magazine. In 1973, Stanczak designed a mural for a 12-story residential building in Cleveland called Carter Manor, which would subsequently become badly damaged due to the contractor&#x27;s decision to use enamel paint. The mural was eventually restored in 2018 by artists participating in that year&#x27;s FRONT Triennial exhibition in Cleveland. As the popularity of Op art began to diminish in the late 1970s, superseded by such movements as Minimalism and later Postminimalism, Stanczak&#x27;s work became progressively separated from mainstream American art. He continued to exhibit frequently until the end of his life, primarily in the Midwest. Some critics have noted that Stanczak&#x27;s medium of acrylic paint and his visual vocabulary had remained largely unchanged since the 1960s, consisting primarily of parallel lines, straight or curved, various grids, and basic geometric shapes such as circles or squares.

=== Later career (1980s-2017) ===
During the early 1990s, Stanczak work was said to have influenced a new generation of artists including Peter Halley and Philip Taaffe. In addition to being an artist, Stanczak was also a teacher, having worked at the Art Academy of Cincinnati from 1957 to 1964 and as Professor of Painting, at the Cleveland Institute of Art, 1964-1995. He was named &quot;Outstanding American Educator&quot; by the Educators of America in 1970. He collaborated with other Polish-American artists, including Hanna Zawa-Cywińska.

In 2007, Stanczak was interviewed by Brian Sherwin for &quot;Myartspace&quot; Blog. During the interview, Stanczak recalled his experiences with war and the loss of his right arm and how both influenced his art. Stanczak explained: &quot;The transition from using my left hand as my right, main hand, was very difficult. My youthful experiences with the atrocities of the Second World War are with me, but I wanted to forget them and live a &#x27;normal&#x27; life and adapt into society more fully. In the search for art, you have to separate what is emotional and what is logical. (...) I looked for anonymity of actions through non-referential, abstract art&quot;. In 2008, Stanczak designed a 364-foot mural made of painted metal rods for the exterior of a corporate building in downtown Cincinnati. In 2013, Stanczak was awarded an honorary doctorate from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. For most of his life, he lived and worked in Seven Hills, Ohio with his wife, sculptor Barbara Stanczak. He died at home on March 25, 2017 at the age of 88 following a short illness.

<doc id="892829" wikidata="Q7059042" url="?curid=892829" title="Northern Territory News">
<text>The Northern Territory News (also known and branded as the NT News) is a morning tabloid newspaper based in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. Owned by News Corp Australia, it is published every week from Monday to Saturday. It primarily serves Darwin and the rest of the Northern Territory and it covers local, national, and world news as well as sports and business. The paper currently has a Monday to Friday readership average of 44,000, reaching an average of 32,000 on Saturdays.

News Corp Australia also publishes its local Sunday counterpart, &quot;The Sunday Territorian&quot;, which is also available throughout Darwin and the Northern Territory, its online regional NT newspaper, the &quot;Centralian Advocate&quot;, as well as free weekly community newspapers (since December 2008) under the banner of &quot;Sun Newspapers&quot; (delivered in Darwin, Palmerston, and Litchfield).

The paper has become well known around Australia for its front-page headlines, with then-Deputy Editor Paul Dyer winning a Walkley Award for his contributions in 2012.

==History==
Prior to the formation of the &quot;Northern Territory News&quot;, the Federal Government was concerned about the perceived &#x27;pro-communist&#x27; bias from &quot;The Northern Standard&quot;, a newspaper which was owned by the North Australian Workers&#x27; Union. In 1949, they approached a Canberra-based journalist, Don Whitington, to establish a rival newspaper, to act as a counterbalance from the bias perceived by the Federal Government from &quot;The Northern Standard&quot;. Whitington formed &quot;Northern Territory News Services Pty Ltd&quot;, aided by Eric White and local printer John Coleman.

The first edition of the &quot;Northern Territory News&quot; was published on 8 February 1952 as a weekly newspaper, later being published on a bi-weekly basis. Its office and print room were originally located from the former site of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank in Smith Street, nicknamed the &#x27;Tin Bank&#x27;. Originally, the paper was quite politically active being a noted advocate of greater self-governance powers for the Northern Territory as well as being vocal on a number of other local issues. However, the paper gradually lapsed into the current apolitical stance it maintains presently with its most noted feature being its unique headlines and front pages.

In 1960, News Limited bought the &quot;Northern Territory News&quot;, and it became a weekday newspaper in 1964. The Saturday edition was introduced in 1966, increasing its publishing schedule to six days a week, reverting to five days a week in 1975, before restarting its Saturday edition in 1979.

In 1967, its office moved to Mitchell Street, opposite Hotel Darwin. On 25 December 1974, the building was destroyed, along with much of Darwin and its surrounds, by Cyclone Tracy, although the &quot;NT News&quot; was still able to print emergency editions during the crisis.

Its Sunday counterpart, the &quot;Sunday Territorian&quot;, was introduced on 7 October 1984. In 1985, the &quot;NT News&quot; relocated to its present location in Printers Place in Darwin City.

In September 2010 the newspaper took delivery of the four-colour KBA Comet printing press which allows it to produce 64 pages in full colour. The Comet replaced the Uniman 2/2 machine on the floor, which increased its capacity to allow the plant to produce each Sunday to Friday edition in a single run, and to produce the Saturday edition in three runs instead of five runs.

On 30 July 2019, the &quot;Northern Territory News&quot; was resized from its original 405 millimetre high size, down to 350 millimetres from 12 August, with print editions of the &quot;Sunday Territorian&quot; and the &quot;Centralian Advocate&quot; following suit, being the first Australian newspaper to implement this format. The size is similar to the dimensions used by other international News Corp tabloids, most notably the &quot;New York Post&quot;. On 29 June 2020, the &quot;Centralian Advocate&quot; moved to a digital-only format, along with numerous other News Corp-owned regional newspapers across Australia.

<doc id="892836" wikidata="Q4199411" url="?curid=892836" title="Yuffie Kisaragi">
<text>is a character from Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. She was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and was first introduced in the 1997 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as a young female ninja princess and thief. She is an optional party member, and can be recruited through a sidequest. Yuffie reappears in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; series, which expands on her background and shows her after the events of the original game. 

Yuffie has been featured in other Square Enix games, most notably the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, and is voiced in Japanese by Yumi Kakazu. She is voiced in English by Christy Carlson Romano in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;, Mae Whitman in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind&quot;, and Suzie Yeung in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;. Yuffie is popular in East Asia, but her reception in Western media has been more mixed.

==Concept and design==
During early development of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Yuffie was envisioned as a 25-year-old ex-SOLDIER now working as a bounty hunter, seeking both the game&#x27;s protagonist Cloud Strife and its antagonist Sephiroth, while having a bounty on her. Her job class was originally listed as &quot;ninja (assassin)&quot; and she was intended to be a daughter of the long-deceased Kasumi Kisaragi. The Wutai sidequest present in the final incarnation of the game was significantly different. Her age and description was different for each of the several wanted posters, with her appearance and level being determined by the last wanted poster viewed. She would encounter the party in a random encounter or attack Cloud when he is sleeping in an inn. The Wutai scenario required Yuffie to be recruited to complete it.

Having a close attachment to Yuffie&#x27;s character, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; event planner Jun Akiyama was responsible for most cutscenes featuring her and her actions during fights. Regarding the use of Japanese pronouns, Yuffie uses &quot;atashi&quot; &quot;as opposed to the other female characters who use &quot;watashi&quot;, perhaps to make her sound more cute or youthful, as she is younger than the others&quot;. Mae Whitman, who voiced Yuffie in the English versions of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;, said she was not &quot;aware of the extent to which people were familiar with her character already&quot;. In a 2012 interview, Whitman recalled Yuffie as &quot;bubbly and bright and nice. But still super cool!&quot; Yuffie&#x27;s design in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was partially based on the original appearance of Rikku from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Suzie Yeung voiced her at &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&quot;. Yeung said: &quot;I was actually surprised because I didn&#x27;t know to what degree Yuffie was loved and looked forward to, honestly, by the fan community. So, I actually watched some reaction videos to some of them. And it was so wholesome because you can really tell how much fans loved her. I was nervous, but also excited for them to meet her&quot;. During the interview of the developers Naoki Hamaguchi and Motomu Toriyama on Yuffie&#x27;s Moogle hood and role in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&quot;, Toriyama said that Yuffie wears the hood as a reference to when it was used in &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;. In addition, he stated that she wears it whenever she is on a covert mission, while her role is the same as in the original game. Toriyama also said that he chose to give Yuffie her own story DLC over Vincent, stating that &quot;Yuffie, the heroine of Episode Intermission was not guaranteed to join your party in the original game, but that actually made her a character that we had more freedom to expand on the backstory for&quot;. Square Enix changed Yuffie&#x27;s original design to include more realistic details while preserving its ninja aspects and Japanese style. The company shared that, while the tissue physics in its model run in real time, Yuffie&#x27;s legwarmers are individually adjusted so they do not fall off. In &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, Hamaguchi expressed a desire to leverage the new gameplay and battle mechanics introduced in the downloadable content (DLC) episode &quot;INTERmission&quot;, such as team-up attacks performed by Yuffie and Sonon Kusakabe, in the next game, as he felt they made for a &quot;different feel in battle strategy&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
Yuffie appears in the 1997 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as one of two optional party members along with Vincent. She is a 16-year-old ninja and thief who wields shurikens that she can throw like a boomerang. She is a fiercely patriotic daughter of , the leader of , which is based on East Asia; Yuffie feels her country has lost its former glory and become nothing more than a resort town. After losing the war against Shinra Electric Power Company, Godo began to turn Wutai into a tourist attraction. This did not suit Yuffie, who began running off, stealing Materia from travelers in hopes of someday becoming strong enough to change this situation. Yuffie is sneaky and arrogant and has a tomboyish and charismatic personality and obsessively steals and collects Materia. She also tends to be short-tempered and is prone to motion sickness. Gameplay-wise, Yuffie possesses the special Materia &quot;Throw&quot;, enabling her to throw most items from the player&#x27;s inventory at enemies during combat. When leveled up, she unlocks the ability &quot;Coin&quot;, allowing her to throw the party&#x27;s Gil currency at the enemy.

Yuffie is introduced when she ambushes the protagonist Cloud Strife and his allies in a random encounter in a forest biome, appearing as &quot;Mystery Ninja&quot;. If the player defeats her in combat and then chooses the correct series of dialogue choices, she introduces herself and joins the player&#x27;s party as one of the player characters. However, once in Wutai Village, Yuffie steals the party&#x27;s Materia and hides, but is kidnapped by a Midgar crime lord, the lecherous Don Corneo. Once the group rescues Yuffie, she returns the stolen Materia and continues working with them. In another sidequest, she proves herself by fighting the bosses of Wutai&#x27;s five-story pagoda, the last of these battles being against Godo. These fights, and the subsequent sequence of conversations, enable her and Godo to understand each other and come to a mutual respect. At Godo&#x27;s request, Cloud officially takes Yuffie, who obtains her level 4 Limit Break &quot;All Creation&quot;, with him on his quest.

If Yuffie is present at the end of disc one when Aerith Gainsborough is murdered by Sephiroth, she shows an uncharacteristic display of emotion, as she breaks down in Cloud&#x27;s arms after failing to control her emotions. Yuffie&#x27;s loyalty to the team is called into question after Cloud temporarily disbands his party ahead of their final confrontation with Sephiroth; when Yuffie is the last to return, Barret Wallace suspects her of abandoning the team in light of her earlier treachery at Wutai. When Yuffie returns to the group, she subsequently rebukes Barrett for his judgement.

Yuffie is featured in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&quot;, appearing as the sole playable character in its bonus &quot;Intermission&quot; storyline, which occurs parallel to the story of the main game. She and her partner Sonon Kasukabe infiltrate Midgar to steal the &quot;Ultimate Materia&quot; from Shinra. When the mission goes wrong, Sonon sacrifices himself to save Yuffie, and she resolves to gather allies to take down Shinra. She returns as a party member in the sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;.

===&quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;===

In the 2005 animated film &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;, Yuffie reunites with her allies to fight against the summon creature Bahamut SIN. In the &quot;On the Way to a Smile&quot; novella &quot;Case of Yuffie&quot;, which is set between the end of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and the beginning of &quot;Advent Children&quot;, the disease Geostigma spreads to Wutai, and Yuffie sets out to find a cure.

In the 2004 action role-playing game &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, which is set six years before &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Yuffie encounters Shinra&#x27;s agents called the Turks in Wutai and unknowingly works with them against the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE. In the 2006 third-person shooter game &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;, which is set one year after &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Yuffie leaves home and joins the World Regenesis Organization, where she is placed in charge of espionage and intelligence gathering. 

A nine-year-old Yuffie makes brief appearances in the 2007 prequel action role-playing game &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, where she fights against Shinra following their invasion and takeover of Wutai. After meeting Zack Fair, she enlists his help to find treasures in several side missions.

===Other appearances===
Outside the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Yuffie has also been featured in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series since 2002. In the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, a younger Yuffie acts as a supporting character in Traverse Town, helping to defeat the Heartless who destroyed her world. Yuffie also appears in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; as a projection from Sora&#x27;s memories in Traverse Town. In 2005&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, she aids Leon and the others as part of the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee, and appears in her &quot;Advent Children&quot; attire. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Yuffie is featured as an opponent in the Olympus Coliseum, while 2008&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hearts coded&quot; features a virtual simulation of her. She also appears in the DLC expansion &quot;Re:Mind&quot; of &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;.

Yuffie is an unlockable playable character in the PlayStation version of the 1998 fighting game &quot;Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring&quot;, appearing alongside other characters from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. She is also one of the playable characters in the 2006 board video game &quot;Itadaki Street Portable&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, in a &quot;chibi&quot;-style design similar to her model during the exploration gameplay mode of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and in the 2013 action puzzle mobile game &quot;Pictlogica Final Fantasy&quot;, also in a &quot;chibi&quot; form. She was the first DLC character released for the 2014 rhythm game &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call&quot;. Yuffie also appears as a playable character in the free-to-play role-playing video games &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot; (2014) and &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot; (2017).

Yuffie also makes appearances in some video games as a non-playable character. In the 2008 action role-playing / fighting game hybrid &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, she appears as a tutor of the in-game manuals and an unlockable friend card. She is a &quot;Legend&quot; type assist character in the 2012 social role-playing mobile game &quot;Final Fantasy Airborne Brigade&quot;. Yuffie also appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a spirit.

==Reception==
Yuffie Kisaragi has received a notably positive reception in Japan and overseas, being described as one of the best ninja and overall video game characters. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) included &quot;seeing Yuffie once again&quot; as one of the greatest moments of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; while giving it their Role-Playing Game of the Year 2002 award. David Smith from &quot;IGN&quot; included her on their top ten &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; characters, stating that she &quot;belongs in the Wacky Sidekicks wing of the RPG hall of fame&quot;; although commenting that Yuffie can sometimes be &quot;a pain in the neck&quot;, Smith said that she became such an appealing sidekick character that Square would go on to use the &quot;Yuffie formula&quot; with Rikku for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; director Yoshinori Kitase asked &quot;EGM&quot; &quot;why American gamers love Yuffie so much&quot;. They were unable to come with a clear answer. According to &quot;Edge&quot;, Yuffie, being one of characters that are &quot;brands in and of themselves&quot;, created a new anime stereotype, as giddy girl ninja. WomanGamers.com gave the character an overall score of 7.0/10, opining that while &quot;a 18 year old ninja girl was a nice refreshing change [...] it would have been nice if her character had matured and developed through this story&quot;. Jef Rouner of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; described Yuffie&#x27;s reaction to Aerith&#x27;s death as one of the five most &quot;heartbreaking&quot; missable scenes in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, which he felt rivaled the emotional impact of anything found in the main narrative. In his review for &quot;Advent Children&quot;, James Mielke of &quot;1UP.com&quot; called her &quot;as cutely jailbait as ever&quot;; the film itself was called &quot;Ogling Legal-Age Yuffie&quot; by Geson Hatchett of &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot;. 

However, some of the reception was more negative. In her character profile, &quot;IGN&quot; called her &quot;both impressively useful and incredibly annoying&quot;. &quot;GameFan&quot; editor The 6th Man compared himself to Yuffie, as &quot;in one word—annoying&quot; but also having &quot;that innocent, naive qualify&quot;. In 2010, Scott Sharkey of 1UP.com described her as being in the category of &quot;The Perky Idiot&quot; alongside Rikku and Selphie while discussing the top five character types in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. That same year, &quot;GamesRadar&quot;″s Mikel Reparaz called her as &quot;hyper-annoying&quot;. In 2013, Kyle Lowe of &quot;Complex&quot; called her as the fifth most annoying classic video game character. Joe Juba of &quot;Game Informer&quot; included her among &quot;&quot;Final Fantasy&quot;″s particular breed of annoying companions, like Selphie and Vaan&quot;. Lisa Foiles of &quot;The Escapist&quot; included her in their &quot;crazy, hyperactive teenager&quot; on her top five annoying princesses in video games, calling her &quot;just a definition of annoying&quot;. As a result of calling her an unimportant character in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; due to how difficult is to get her, &quot;Paste&quot; regarded Yuffie&#x27;s portrayal in the remake as far more entertaining take on Yuffie due to her role in the narrative, while &quot;Kotaku&quot; praised and said that she&#x27;s &quot;irresistibly charming as Yuffie&quot;.

<doc id="892837" wikidata="Q2294772" url="?curid=892837" title="Aerith Gainsborough">
<text>, transliterated as Aeris Gainsborough in the English releases of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, is a character in Square&#x27;s (now Square Enix) role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. She was designed by Tetsuya Nomura with influence from Yoshinori Kitase, Hironobu Sakaguchi and Yoshitaka Amano.

She is one of the main characters of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, a young woman allied with the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE. Over the course of the story, AVALANCHE begin to pursue the game&#x27;s antagonist Sephiroth, and the player learns that she is the last surviving Cetra, or &quot;Ancient&quot;, one of the planet&#x27;s oldest races. She is ultimately murdered by Sephiroth. She has also appeared in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series.

She is voiced in Japanese by Maaya Sakamoto. In English, she is voiced by Mandy Moore in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Mena Suvari in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;, Andrea Bowen in &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot; and the Re Mind DLC of &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, and Briana White in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;. Aerith and the events surrounding her death in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; have been met with overall positive reception from critics and fans.

==Concept and creation==
Aerith was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress was designed to appear ladylike and contrast with Tifa Lockhart&#x27;s miniskirt. During development, Aerith was supposed to be Sephiroth&#x27;s sister, as their designs resembled each other. However, they were made former lovers, with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith&#x27;s first love was changed to Zack Fair.

Her green eyes were meant to symbolize nature and contrast with Tifa&#x27;s brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith&#x27;s design for &quot;Advent Children&quot;, but her design was updated in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire resemble how Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, adding white and green colors; this version was also used as the basis for her design in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;.

Aerith&#x27;s original Japanese name is . This was transliterated to &quot;Aeris&quot; in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Aerith&quot; in later products. Both transliterations have basis, as the Japanese &quot;su&quot; () is used when transcribing &quot;s&quot; () and &quot;th&quot; () to Japanese. However, official Japanese material uses the spelling &quot;Aerith&quot;, and developers stated that &quot;Aerith&quot; is a near-anagram of &quot;Earth&quot;.

In early planning stages of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Aerith was to be one of only three protagonists alongside Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; interview: &quot;Cloud&#x27;s the main character, so you can&#x27;t really kill him. And Barrett... well, that&#x27;s maybe too obvious&quot;. While designing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Nomura was frustrated with the &quot;perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love&quot;. He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked &quot;Is it right to set such an example to people?&quot; Kitase concluded: &quot;In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, &#x27;If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently&#x27;. These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith&#x27;s death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood&quot;.

According to Nomura, &quot;death should be something sudden and unexpected, and Aerith&#x27;s death seemed more natural and realistic&quot;. He said: &quot;When I reflect on &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the fact that fans were so offended by her sudden death probably means that we were successful with her character. If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn&#x27;t an effective character&quot;. From the original release of the game, rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back, but this was scrapped in development. Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true, as he said that &quot;the world was expecting us to bring her back to life, as this is the classic convention&quot;. A lengthy petition asking for Aerith&#x27;s revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase, but he dismissed it, pointing out that &quot;there are many meanings in Aerith&#x27;s death and [her revival] could never happen&quot;. Mena Suvari explained that for &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Aerith was given a mothering feel with an ephemeral presence, and expressed joy for her role.

In &quot;Remake&quot;, Briana White studied Sakamoto&#x27;s acting to appeal to fans.

==Musical theme==


A leitmotif associated with Aerith is played several times throughout &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and was composed by &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; composer Nobuo Uematsu. it is first heard during the flashback scenes with Aerith&#x27;s mother at her house, and also plays as she is killed by Sephiroth. The piece &quot;Flowers Blooming in the Church&quot; is based on it.

&quot;Aerith&#x27;s Theme&quot; is very popular among &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fans, and has inspired an orchestral version, a piano version, and a vocal version performed by the artist Rikki, who also performed &quot;Suteki Da Ne&quot; for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. A piano arrangement of the theme appears twice in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, and the track &quot;Water&quot; shares similarities with it. The opening phrase of &quot;Aerith&#x27;s Theme&quot; appears prior to the climax of the track &quot;Divinity II&quot;, which also includes as its final line the Latin phrase &quot;Sola Dea fatum novit&quot; (&quot;Only the goddess knows fate&quot;), and is also featured during the end credits of the film. It has been reinterpreted on the OverClocked ReMix &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; compilation &quot;Voices of the Lifestream&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Aerith&#x27;s Theme&quot; achieved the third place in the Classic FM Hall of Fame.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;=== 
Aerith Gainsborough is first introduced as a flower seller, when she briefly converses with Cloud Strife, a mercenary working for the anti-government group AVALANCHE, who are fleeing from the bombing of a Mako reactor. The two later meet in Aerith&#x27;s church in the Sector 5 slums, where she is faced with the possibility of capture by the Turks. Aerith asks Cloud to be her bodyguard for the cost of a date. She is eventually apprehended, but is ultimately rescued by Cloud and his allies. Aerith then joins them in the pursuit of Sephiroth, while also embarking on her own journey of self-discovery.

After a failed attempt to foil Sephiroth&#x27;s theft of the Black Materia, Aerith ventures alone into the Forgotten City. Cloud and his companions pursue her and eventually find her praying at an altar. As Aerith looks up to smile at Cloud, Sephiroth appears and kills her by impaling her through the torso. Cloud carries Aerith&#x27;s body out into a lake in the Forgotten City and releases her back to the Planet. Reeve Tuesti, the head of Shinra Urban and Development, brings the news of her death to Elmyra Gainsborough, Aerith&#x27;s adoptive mother. The party later learns why Aerith was in the Forgotten City; through her White Materia, Aerith was able to summon Holy, the only force capable of repelling the ultimate destructive magic, Meteor, which Sephiroth has summoned. Although Aerith successfully cast Holy before her death, it is being held back by the power of Sephiroth&#x27;s will. When Sephiroth is finally defeated and Holy is released, it appears that it is too late to function effectively, as Meteor is approaching the Planet&#x27;s surface. While Holy clashes with Meteor and attempts to prevent its impact, the gravity of both Meteor and the Planet pulling on Holy in opposite directions weakens it. Aerith is seen praying whilst urging the Lifestream to defend the planet. The Planet&#x27;s Lifestream then flows forth, intervening between Holy and Meteor and aiding in the destruction of Meteor.

===&quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
In &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, which is set several years prior to the events of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Aerith becomes the target of the original incarnation of AVALANCHE, led by Elfé, who seek to prevent Shinra from acquiring the last surviving Cetra. Instead, AVALANCHE intend to use her to learn the whereabouts of the Promised Land for their own purposes, although a member of the Turks tries to protect her.

Aerith makes several appearances in the CGI film &quot;Advent Children&quot; as Cloud&#x27;s spiritual guide, urging him to move on with his life and forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past, but she acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support. One of Aerith&#x27;s interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game&#x27;s party helps in Cloud&#x27;s final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She appears again in the final scene of the film, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack walk into the light. Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith&#x27;s church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma.

The &quot;On the Way to a Smile&quot; novella &quot;Case of the Lifestream – Black &amp; White&quot; focuses on Aerith and Sephiroth&#x27;s respective journeys through the Lifestream after the end of the game but before the events of the film. The &quot;Black&quot; section deals with Sephiroth, and the &quot;White&quot; with Aerith.

Aerith appears in the prequel game &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, where she is 16 years old. She meets Zack, whom she develops feelings for during his stay in Midgar. Aerith and Zack develop a romantic relationship, but Zack is killed after escaping from being held in a Mako chamber for four years in the Shinra Mansion basement and defending Cloud from Shinra soldiers. During those years, Aerith helped her adopted mother earn a living by growing and selling flowers, a job that results in her meeting Cloud at the beginning of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

Aerith is featured prominently in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, which covers the Midgar portion of the original game. Unlike in the original localization, the remake gives her name as the more widely-accepted Aerith rather than Aeris.

===Other appearances===
Aerith&#x27;s character has appeared in several games outside of the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; continuity. In &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, she appears as a flower girl; when a group of criminals harasses her, Cloud appears and the player engages in battle with the group, letting her escape. &quot;Itadaki Street Special&quot; features a playable version of Aerith, as well as other &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; characters Tifa Lockhart, Cloud Strife, and Sephiroth. She also appears in &quot;Itadaki Street Portable&quot; with the same characters from &quot;Special&quot;, with the addition of Yuffie Kisaragi. Aerith appears in the fighting game &quot;Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy&quot; as an assistant character. She is also featured in the rhythm game &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot; as a sub-character representing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. In &quot;LittleBigPlanet 2&quot;, Aerith is featured as a downloadable character model. Aerith also appears as a Mii costume and Spirit in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

Aerith appears in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series as a member of a group dedicated to defeating the Heartless, which includes fellow &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; characters Yuffie and Cid, and Leon of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. In the plot of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Aerith suggests a method for defeating the Heartless to protagonists Donald Duck, Goofy and Sora, and gives advice to the player throughout the game. She also appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; as a perceptive figment of Sora&#x27;s memories. Aerith returns in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, wearing a modified version of her dress from &quot;Before Crisis&quot;. She, Leon, Cid and Yuffie run a restoration committee for the town of Hollow Bastion. Aerith and the restoration committee return in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind&quot; expansion, helping Riku search for the missing Sora.

&quot;Hoshi o Meguru Otome&quot;, a novella written by Benny Matsuyama which appears in the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω&quot; guide, follows Aerith&#x27;s journey through the Lifestream following her death in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Aerith is mentioned on a graffiti in a subway station early in the animated film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, which reads &quot;Aerith Lives&quot;.

==Reception==
Aerith has received an overall positive reception from critics. &quot;GamesTM&quot; referred to her as a &quot;gaming legend&quot;. RPGamer&#x27;s Stuart Hoggan opined that although Aerith &quot;represented the token damsel in distress&quot;, she &quot;broke the mould in terms of personality&quot;, possessing &quot;an admirable pluck that was not brassy nor off-putting&quot;. In a &quot;This American Life&quot; episode, titled &quot;Save the Girl&quot;, reporter Lina Misitzis described the character as one-dimensional and lacking in personality. She and Kotaku writer Mike Fahey conclude that had the character been anything other than a pretty girl she would have needed much more development in order to elicit an emotional response from the player. Aerith&#x27;s romantic relationship with Cloud was also praised though some sites noted there were arguments between fans about whether or not Tifa was more suitable to be Cloud&#x27;s love interest. In a retrospective, &quot;Polygon&quot; analyzed several arguments fans have made about Cloud&#x27;s preferred partner and how each side misrepresents the other&#x27;s chosen heroine. &quot;Polygon&quot; concludes that there is no winning couple as, after killing Sephiroth, Cloud has a vision of Aerith when Tifa tries to help him and the duo agrees to meet her again. In contrast to this, Aerith&#x27;s relationship with Zack Fair was noted to be a more impactful based on her role in &quot;Crisis Core&quot;. Cloud is also seen as a Messiah with Tifa and Aerith being one of his main supporters to help progress and defeat Sephiroth, though the end of the narrative has Cloud appreciating the victory thanks to his &quot;pillars&quot;.

Aerith&#x27;s death in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; has received a great deal of attention. According to &quot;GamesTM&quot;, her death helped establish the popularity of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Players commented on message boards and blogs about the emotional impact the scene held. Fans submitted a petition to Yoshinori Kitase requesting her return. Tom&#x27;s Games called the scene &quot;one of the most powerful and memorable scenes of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series—or any other game, for that matter&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; called her death the &quot;dramatic highpoint&quot; of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and suggested that reintroducing her through the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; titles &quot;arguably undermines this great moment&quot;. Said death has also been cited as the defining moment of a star-crossed love story, between her and main character Cloud Strife. Brian Taylor, writing for &quot;Kill Screen&quot;, described a cottage industry of fan theories for how to return Aerith to life or prevent her death. He compared these efforts to the letter-writing campaign to convince Charles Dickens not to let Nell, the endearing protagonist of &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;, die at the end of the book. Taylor affirmed that the acts of discussing these fan theories and dissecting the game code to test them comprise a valid and important part of the experience of the game. In &quot;A Feeling of Wrongness: Pessimistic Rhetoric on the Fringes of Popular Culture&quot;, Aerith is seen a highly developed character due to Cloud visiting her mother and how often the protagonist and the heroine often talk. As Aerith plays a more active role in combat, her death is also noted to affect the gamer as a result of how useful she is. Benjamin Banasik from Heidelberg University noted the impact of Aerith&#x27;s death is mostly seen in Cloud&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Advent Children&quot; as he seeks redemption for her, leading him to his transformation into a heroic leader in the process. In &quot;The World of Final Fantasy VII: Essays on the Game and Its Legacy&quot;, Aerith&#x27;s death is described as a disastrous traumatic reminder of the eventual war. Game journalist Mike Fahey expressed concern in regards to this event being repeated in the &quot;Remake&quot; chronology as he saw the original Aerith as the least developed heroine in the game.

The character&#x27;s traits in the remake were praised by &quot;Siliconera&quot; due to how caring she is and how developed she becomes across the narrative. Despite criticizing for not doing wrong things that balance her, &quot;Siliconera&quot; still enjoyed the scene where she volunteers for Don Corneo. &quot;The Escapist&quot; noted that while the player primarily controls Cloud, Aerith remains as the actual hero of the game. As a result, when the &quot;Remake&quot; was released, gamers wondered 
if in this game it was possible to save her. In the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts, Aerith&#x27;s role in &quot;Remake&quot; and comments in the ending are noted to build up the apparent message of the installment in regards to how the same narrative should not be repeated with Aerith&#x27;s quote &quot;boundless, terrifying freedom&quot; which is made in response to Sephiroth&#x27;s values. Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences also wrote about the specter that interacts with a confused Cloud about their potential relationship was noted to stand out in the game as the former tells the latter not to fall in love with him as if Square Enix is reacting to the player&#x27;s constricted conditions, potential desires, and narrative expectations when compared with the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. In &quot;More Than Just a Flower Girl: A Personal Thank You to Aerith Gainsborough&quot;, Alana Hagues from RPGFan expresses multiple feelings involving her Aerith&#x27;s characterization; Despite being initially bothered by the idea of Aerith by a &quot;girl&quot; or weak, Hagues&#x27; noticed that she saw the character in a different light upon deciding to fully complete &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Rather than being a damsel in distress, Aerith appeared to challenge gender stereotypes as while faces too many problems in life like dealing with the death of Zack or being the final Cetra, she manages to deal with them and remains strong enough to appreciate life. This is highly notable when Aerith interacts with Cloud or Barret and expresses comfort to them or she lives inside the dangerous areas from Midgar. She realized Aerith was further stronger in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; over &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Crisis Core&quot; which delighted her when seeing her again in &quot;Remake&quot; as it &quot;understands her spirit in the original, but it also does one better.. When it comes to &quot;Rebirth&quot;, Digital Trend wrote &quot;In defense of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s polarizing ending&quot; where Cloud&#x27;s failures to save Aerith in the story comes across dealing with trauma; The returning player find a possible way to stop Aerith&#x27;s death like Cloud attempts and instead ends in tragedy again. Aerith tells Cloud that she is going to die just like Zack dies in the original timeline and it is her choice. This scene helps Cloud not feel the event to feel like a personal failure and that he can improve himself.

<text>Ilsington is a village and civil parish situated on the eastern edge of Dartmoor, Devon, England. It is one of the largest parishes in the county, and includes the villages of Ilsington, Haytor Vale, Liverton and South Knighton. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Bovey Tracey, Teigngrace (a short border only), Newton Abbot, Ogwell (another short border), Bickington, Ashburton, Widecombe-in-the-Moor and Manaton. In 2001 the population of the parish was 2,444, greatly increased from the 886 residents recorded in 1901.
The parish is represented in parliament by Mel Stride, as part of the Central Devon constituency.

==History==

The village is believed to be an ancient settlement – probably existing 200 to 300 years before the Norman Conquest. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Ilestintona, and there is known to have been a church there since at least the 11th century. St. Michael&#x27;s parish church, as seen today, dates back to the 15th century. It was the site of an incident which has passed into local folklore: in 1639 the schoolroom, which was above the west lychgate of the church, collapsed into the street and churchyard.

Apart from its agricultural history, Ilsington&#x27;s industrial archaeology reflects the mining of the 18th and 19th centuries. The Atlas tin mine and the Smallacombe iron mine were major local enterprises – with the cottages at Lewthorne Cross being built for William Grose, the mine captain and mine workers. Nearby, at Haytor, granite was quarried and carried down to the Stover Canal at Ventiford, Teigngrace, on the Haytor Granite Tramway, the route of which is now commemorated in the Templer Way footpath. Haytor granite was used in the building of many civic structures including London Bridge, over the Thames in London.

Through the centuries, Ilsington village appears to have been largely self-supporting. Census returns and church records show a variety of rural occupations among the local community including farmers, blacksmiths, carpenters, thatchers and stone workers. It had an ancient manor house which fell into ruin after occupation ceased in about 1825. The village&#x27;s most famous resident was the playwright John Ford, who was born at Bagtor House.

==Today==

Today, the village has a pub (The Carpenters Arms) a hotel (The Ilsington Hotel) and a village shop (Ilsington Village Shop), a non-profit shop where the villagers work voluntary shifts throughout the week. Nearby Haytor Vale has the Rock Inn, and Liverton has The Star and The Welcome Stranger. There are two schools in the parish: Blackpool School and Ilsington Primary School. Comedian Josh Widdicombe attended the latter after his family relocated from London. 

&quot;The Book of Ilsington: A Photographic History of the Parish&quot; was written by Dick Wills who lived in the parish all his life, and was the 14th generation of the Wills family to live and farm at Narracombe. He died shortly after the publication of his book in 2000.

Liverton United F.C. play in Division 3 South Devon Football League, and Ilsington Villa A.F.C. play in the Premier Division South Devon Football League.

==Governance==
Ilsington is governed locally by the Ilsington Parish Council. It also has representation on the Teignbridge District Council.

<text>Anna Maria dePeyster (&quot;née&quot; Torv; formerly Murdoch and Mann; born 30 June 1944) is a British and Australian journalist and novelist. She became the second wife of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and was a director at News Corp.

==Early life and education==
Anna Maria Torv was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1944 to Jakob Tõrv (anglicised Jacob Torv), an Estonian merchant seaman, and Sylvia Iris Bodfish, a Scottish drycleaner&#x27;s shop assistant. Her parents had a drycleaning business in Glasgow, until they emigrated to Australia.

After the picnic park that her parents had opened outside Sydney went bankrupt, her mother left the family household. She has two brothers, Jaan and Hans Arvid, and one sister, Karin Elisabeth. Raised Catholic, she attended Our Lady of Mercy College, Parramatta, New South Wales.

==Career==
Torv started her journalistic career at the age of 18, working on Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and also worked as a journalist for the Sydney &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. 

She later served on the board of directors of News Corporation.

==Writing==
Under the name Anna Murdoch, she wrote the novel &quot;In Her Own Image&quot; (1985). It is about two sisters who fall in love with the same man on a sheep station close to the Murrumbidgee River.

==Personal life==
Torv was married to media mogul Rupert Murdoch from 1967 to 1999. 
She and Murdoch had three children:
*Elisabeth Murdoch (born 1968)
*Lachlan Murdoch (born 1971)
*James Murdoch (born 1972)

According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, the people who in 1969 kidnapped and then killed Muriel McKay, wife of Murdoch&#x27;s deputy Alick McKay, had originally intended to kidnap Anna Murdoch instead, and confusion arose when the McKays had made use of one of Murdoch&#x27;s vehicles.

They divorced on 8 June 1999 as a result of Rupert&#x27;s affair with Wendi Deng. Anna reportedly received $1.7 billion (including $110 million in cash) from the settlement. A later report said that she chose to take a &quot;relatively small&quot; settlement, comprising half cash and half property, of $US200 million, rather than go for half of his wealth, to which she was entitled under California law. She said in a 2001 interview that she had been entitled to some of the seven homes they had shared, but walked away from that. 

She was instrumental in setting up a family trust at this time, to protect her children and to prevent Deng&#x27;s children having a say in News Corp. In a 2001 interview with &quot;Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, she spoke of how badly Rupert had behaved, not only having an affair, but pushing her off the board of News Corp. The trust gives the children born before this time (including stepdaughter Prudence, from Murdoch&#x27;s first marriage) equal say in the fate of the businesses: each would have one vote in the trust, while their father would have four. Almost all of the family&#x27;s wealth is in shares controlling 40% of both News Corp and Fox Corporation, and is tied up in the trust, which is worth around $US6 billion. The terms of the trust dictate that the four children would continue to have these votes after Rupert&#x27;s death. When Rupert Murdoch made moves to change the terms of the trust so that only Lachlan would have voting rights in his companies in 2023, the other three children challenged this in court in 2024.

She remarried six months later, in December 1999, to William Mann, a financier who was CEO of Henry Mann Securities. They remained married until his death in August 2017. During this time she was known as Anna Mann, but often referred to in the press as Anna Murdoch Mann. The couple resided in The Hamptons, New York, in a house which they bought from philanthropist Yasmin Aga Khan in 2000. 

After Mann&#x27;s death, she married again in April 2019 to Ashton dePeyster, and became known as Anna Maria dePeyster.

She is the aunt of Australian actress Anna Torv, whose father is dePeyster&#x27;s brother, the broadcaster Hans Torv.

==Recognition==
In 1998, then Anna Murdoch, she was made a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, an honorary order conferred by Pope John Paul II, for having supported the Archdiocesan Education Foundation and other Catholic causes in Los Angeles. Her husband Rupert was made a knight.

<text>South Norwood Country Park is a park in South Norwood, close to Elmers End and Birkbeck train stations. The historic Kent-Surrey border runs through the site, and since 1965 it has been located wholly in the London Borough of Croydon. It is a 47 hectare (116 acre) green space which opened in 1989. The park is a mix of countryside and parkland, and land formerly used for sewage farms serving the growing London population.

Croydon Sports Arena, the home of Croydon F.C., is on the south-eastern edge of the park. There is also a car park and visitor centre, and a duck pond similar to the one at South Norwood Lake.

== History ==
The site that is now known as South Norwood Country Park has undergone many changes in its long and chequered history, from the days of the Great North Wood to ancient moated house, sewage farm, farming, the war years, civil defence, allotments, wasteland, highways, refuse dump and now the Country Park.

=== La Motes medieval moated site ===
The Park was the location of a medieval moated manor, the site of which is a scheduled monument. An archaeological excavation was carried out in 1972 by Lillian Thornhill on behalf of the Croydon Natural History &amp; Scientific Society in an attempt to ascertain the age of the double-sided moat shown on the Thomas Morley estate map of 1736 with the name &quot;La Motes&quot;. On an earlier estate map of Peter Burrell, the land is indicated as adjoining &quot;Sturts Land&quot; and is given the name &quot;Lame Oates&quot; which is obviously a phonetic corruption of &quot;La Motes&quot;.

Deeds of 1467 relate to a mortgage transaction at &quot;Leweland&quot; between Richard at Cherte and Stephan and John Fabian of London. At an earlier date, there is documentary evidence of a 13th- or 14th-century manor house of some importance on the site. The principal owner was Robert de Retford, one of the King&#x27;s itinerant judges, active between 1295 and 1318. The low-lying position of the land, with streams flowing through it, raises the possibility of natural phenomena, such as the floods of 1315 to 1317, having played a part in the house&#x27;s disappearance.

Most of the moated earthworks were filled in during the period when the site was used as a sewage farm. The site is formed of two concentric moats, in the middle of which is a square platform where the manor house once stood. The site is now heavily overgrown, though it can be made out on old aerial photographs.

=== Sewage farm ===
From about 1862 the land was acquired by Croydon Corporation for use as a sewage farm. This was largely unsuccessful because of the heavy London Clay subsoil that makes up the majority of the site. A series of concrete channels (some of which are still visible today) were constructed to direct the sewage over the numerous lagoons but these were a failure as the lagoons would remain flooded for months without draining away.
In the 1920s a new method for the treatment of sewage had to be found so the farm was largely abandoned and a new sewage treatment works was built on the area now used for the pitch and putt course. This was shut down in 1962 and the area was left mostly undisturbed until the creation of the Country Park in 1988–99. It is still often referred to as &#x27;the Sewage Farm&#x27; by the older local residents, however, despite not having been used as such for several decades. The manager of the farm was Albert David Prior.

=== War years ===
The years leading up to World War II brought about even more dramatic changes, with the armed forces using the area for training. During the war, the site became an A.R.P. (Air Raid Precaution) centre and the civil defence unit was also based here until the 1950s; there was even a ruined house that was specially constructed for the rescue services to practise in.

During the blitz, when hundreds of buildings were destroyed in Croydon (a heavily targeted town) and surrounding areas, much of the spoils were dumped on the land. This rubble eventually mounted up to form what is now the large hill behind the sports arena today. It is the principal viewpoint in the park and from the top of it you can see the London Docklands, Shirley Hills, Crystal Palace, Croydon, and as far east as Bromley.

It is the southern terminus of a cycling route from Greenwich, called the Waterlink Way.

== Playground ==
The playground at South Norwood Country Park has been rebuilt since it was shut down in 2006 due to health and safety issues.
During 2008 Croydon Council constructed a lottery-funded playground in a large space which was formerly part of the pitch and putt course. The equipment is intended for children aged 4 to 14.

== Wildlife ==
With a wide range of different habitats, the country park is a haven for wildlife and an important site for nature conservation. It is a Local Nature Reserve.

Many wetlands and ponds in Britain have become polluted or have disappeared, leaving the plants and animals that like wet conditions with fewer places to live. The Dragonfly Pond was built to encourage dragonflies and damselflies, and many other plants and animals such as frogs, toads and newts can be found there too. In the summer months the blue and green Emperor Dragonfly, the largest dragonfly in Britain, can be found there.

South Norwood Country Park has an excellent bird record with over 100 different species being sighted each year. The large wetlands in particular attract a wide variety of birds.

<text>Palace Amusements was a historical indoor amusement park in Asbury Park, New Jersey. It was built in 1888 and expanded several times over its history; but after a worsening economic situation in both Asbury and the country in the mid-1980s, it went out of business in 1988.

Several efforts were made to save the structure, including its hand-carved carousel, murals and decorations, but in 2004, after an independent structural inspection, the building was deemed unsafe (it had already been damaged in several areas) and was ordered demolished. A local grassroots organization was able to save several pieces from the building, including the famed Tillie mural.

==Bruce Springsteen==
The Palace is mentioned in 1974 Bruce Springsteen hit &quot;Born to Run&quot; in the lines &quot;Beyond the Palace, hemi-powered drones / Scream down the boulevard&quot;.

<doc id="892865" wikidata="Q1368780" url="?curid=892865" title="Essential thrombocythemia">
<text>In hematology, essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a rare chronic blood cancer (myeloproliferative neoplasm) characterised by the overproduction of platelets (thrombocytes) by megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. It may, albeit rarely, develop into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis. It is one of the blood cancers wherein the bone marrow produces too many white or red blood cells, or platelets.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people with essential thrombocythemia are without symptoms at the time of diagnosis, which is usually made after noting an elevated platelet level on a routine complete blood count (CBC). The most common symptoms are bleeding (due to dysfunctional platelets), blood clots (e.g., deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, visual disturbances, dizziness, fainting, and numbness in the extremities; the most common signs are increased white blood cell count, reduced red blood cell count, and an enlarged spleen.

==Cause==
In ET, megakaryocytes are more sensitive to growth factors. Platelets derived from the abnormal megakaryocytes are activated, which, along with the elevated platelet count, contributes to the likelihood of forming blood clots. The increased possibility of bleeding when the platelet count is over 1 million is due to von Willebrand factor (vWF) sequestration by the increased mass of platelets, leaving insufficient vWF for platelet adhesion. A mutation in the JAK2 kinase (V617F) is present in 40–50% of cases and is diagnostic if present. &quot;JAK2&quot; is a member of the Janus kinase family.

In 2013, two groups detected calreticulin mutations in a majority of JAK2-negative/MPL-negative patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, which makes &quot;CALR&quot; mutations the second most common in myeloproliferative neoplasms. All mutations (insertions or deletions) affected the last exon, generating a reading frame shift of the resulting protein, that creates a novel terminal peptide and causes a loss of endoplasmic reticulum KDEL retention signal.

There are three known genetic mutations that cause ET. The most common genetic mutation is a JAK2 mutation. Roughly 50% of the population of ET patients have this mutation. The JAK 2 gene signals a protein that promotes the growth of cells. The protein is part of a signaling pathway called the JAK/STAT pathway. The JAK2 protein controls the production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells which are located in the bone marrow and can eventually become platelets, red blood cells or white blood cells. Specifically in ET, a JAK2 mutation is acquired rather than inherited. The most common JAK2 mutation is V617F which is the replacement of a valine amino acid with phenylalanine amino acid at the 617 position, hence the name V617F. This mutation results in the JAK2 protein constantly being turned on, which leads to the overproduction of abnormal blood cells, in ET it is platelets or megakaryocytes. There is also another JAK2 mutation found in exon 12, however much less common.

There is also a small number of people who have a different mutation called CALR, which is abbreviated from calreticulin. CALR is a protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Its purpose is to maintain calcium homeostasis and control protein folding. There are three parts to CALR including an amino acid domain, a proline rich P-domain, and a carboxyl domain. All of these parts facilitate the function of CALR. CALR mutation is caused by insertions or deletions of amino acids in exon 9 that cause a reading shift, which then leads to the formation of a novel C terminus. There are two common types of CALR mutations, type 1 and type 2. Type 1 mutations are a 52-bp deletion and type 2 mutations are a 5-bp insertion. In type 1 mutations, the negatively charged amino acids in the CALR C terminus are completely eliminated, and in the type 2 mutations, roughly half are eliminated. There are other mutations involving CALR, however these two are the most common.

Lastly, the least common mutation found in patients with ET are MPL mutations. The MPL gene is responsible for making thrombopoeitin receptor proteins which promote the growth and division of cells. This receptor protein is vital in producing platelets. There are various MPL mutations, but most typical are point mutations that cause amino acid changes. The MPL mutation activates the thrombopoeitin receptor despite the absence of the ligand. This causes the constant proliferation of cells.

==Diagnosis==
The following revised diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia were proposed in 2005. The diagnosis requires the presence of both A criteria together with B3 to B6, or of criterion A1 together with B1 to B6. The criteria are as follows:
* A1. Platelet count &gt; 400 × 103/μL for at least 2 months.
* A2. Acquired V617F JAK2 mutation present
* B1. No cause for a reactive thrombocytosis
** normal inflammatory indices
* B2. No evidence of iron deficiency
** stainable iron in the bone marrow or normal red cell mean corpuscular volume
* B3. No evidence of polycythemia vera
** hematocrit &lt; midpoint of normal range or normal red cell mass in presence of normal iron stores
* B4. No evidence of chronic myeloid leukemia
** But the Philadelphia chromosome may be present in up to 10% of cases. Patients with the Philadelphia chromosome have a potential for the development of acute leukemia, especially acute lymphocytic leukemia.
* B5. No evidence of myelofibrosis
** no collagen fibrosis and ≤ grade 2 reticulin fibrosis (using 0–4 scale)
* B6. No evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome
** no significant dysplasia
** no cytogenetic abnormalities suggestive of myelodysplasia

==Treatment==

===Indications===
Not all those affected will require treatment at presentation. Patients are usually designated as having a low or high risk of bleeding or developing blood clots based on their age, medical history, blood counts and their lifestyles. Low risk individuals are usually treated with aspirin, whereas those at high risk are treated with hydroxycarbamide, interferon-α or anagrelide. Currently unapproved but in late-stage clinical trials (NCT04254978) are agents that lower platelets such as bomedemstat.

===Agents===
Hydroxycarbamide, interferon-α and anagrelide can lower the platelet count. Low-dose aspirin is used to reduce the risk of blood clot formation unless the platelet count is very high, where there is a risk of bleeding from the disease, and hence this measure would be counter-productive as aspirin-use increases the risk of bleeding.

The PT1 study compared hydroxyurea plus aspirin to anagrelide plus aspirin as initial therapy for ET. Hydroxyurea treated patients had a lower incidence of arterial thrombosis, lower incidence of severe bleeding and lower incidence of transformation to myelofibrosis, but the risk of venous thrombosis was higher with hydroxycarbamide than with anagrelide. It is unknown whether the results are applicable to all ET patients. In people with symptomatic ET and extremely high platelet counts (exceeding 1 million), plateletpheresis can be used to remove platelets from the blood to reduce the risk of thrombosis.

==Prognosis==
Essential thrombocythemia is sometimes described as a slowly progressive disorder with long asymptomatic periods punctuated by thrombotic or hemorrhagic events. However, well-documented medical regimens can reduce and control the number of platelets, which reduces the risk of these thrombotic or hemorrhagic events. The lifespan of a well-controlled ET person is well within the expected range for a person of similar age but without ET. ET is the myeloproliferative neoplasm least likely to progress to acute myeloid leukemia.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of ET is 0.6-2.5/100,000 per year, the median age at onset is 65–70 years and it is more frequent in females than in males. The incidence in children is 0.09/100,000 per year.

==Pregnancy==
Hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide are contraindicated during pregnancy and nursing. Essential thrombocythemia can be linked with a three-fold increase in risk of miscarriage. Throughout pregnancy, close monitoring of the mother and fetus is recommended. Low-dose low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin) may be used. For life-threatening complications, the platelet count can be reduced rapidly using plateletpheresis, a procedure that removes platelets from the blood and returns the remainder to the patient.

==In popular culture==

Jill Kaplan, the female protagonist of The Pajama Diaries comic strip was diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia.

<text>The Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT) was a British trade union in the printing industry.

==History==
SOGAT was formed in 1966 by the National Union of Printing, Bookbinding and Paper Workers and the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA). The National Union of Printing, Bookbinding and Paper Workers became the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades Division A and NATSOPA became the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades Division 1. The aim was to achieve a complete merger over time, but differences led to in-fighting and in 1970 the two divisions split, Division A retaining the name Society of Graphical and Allied Trades and Division 1 becoming the National Society of Operative Printers, Graphical and Media Personnel (but retaining the NATSOPA acronym).

In 1975, SOGAT officially became the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades 1975 (SOGAT &#x27;75) after amalgamation with the Scottish Graphical Association. In 1982, SOGAT &#x27;75 and NATSOPA finally amalgamated to become the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades 1982 (SOGAT &#x27;82). In 1991, SOGAT &#x27;82 merged with the National Graphical Association to form the Graphical, Paper and Media Union, which subsequently merged with Amicus to become that union&#x27;s Graphical, Paper and Media industrial sector.

==Election results==
The union did not initially sponsor Parliamentary candidates, but shortly after the 1979 general election, it changed its policy. It sponsored Bob Litherland&#x27;s successful candidacy in the 1979 Manchester Central by-election, and also began sponsoring Ron Leighton, who was already a sitting Member of Parliament.

<doc id="892871" wikidata="Q1399341" url="?curid=892871" title="Jalal Al-e-Ahmad">
<text>[[Seyyed]] Jalāl Āl-e-Ahmad (; December 2, 1923September 9, 1969) was a prominent Iranian novelist, short-story writer, translator, philosopher, socio-political critic, sociologist, as well as an anthropologist who was &quot;one of the earliest and most prominent of contemporary Iranian ethnographers&quot;. He popularized the term &quot;gharbzadegi&quot; – variously translated in English as &quot;westernstruck&quot;, &quot;westoxification&quot;, and &quot;Occidentosis&quot; – producing a holistic ideological critique of the West &quot;which combined strong themes of Frantz Fanon and Marx&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jalal was born in Tehran, into a religious family – his father was a cleric – &quot;originally from the village of Aurazan in the Taliqan district bordering Mazandaran in northern Iran, and in due time Jalal was to travel there, exerting himself actively for the welfare of the villagers and devoting to them the first of his anthropological monographs&quot;. He was a cousin of Mahmoud Taleghani. After elementary school Al-e-Ahmad was sent to earn a living in the Tehran bazaar, but also attended Marvi Madreseh for a religious education, and without his father&#x27;s permission, night classes at the Dar ul-Fonun. He went to Seminary of Najaf in 1944 but returned home very quickly. He became &quot;acquainted with the speech and words of Ahmad Kasravi&quot; and was unable to commit to the clerical career his father and brother had hoped he would take, describing it as &quot;a snare in the shape of a cloak and an aba.&quot; He describes his family as a religious family in the autobiographical sketch that published after his death in 1967.

In 1946 he earned an M.A. in Persian literature from Tehran Teachers College and became a teacher, at the same time making a sharp break with his religious family that left him &quot;completely on his own resources.&quot; He pursued academic studies further and enrolled in a doctoral program of Persian literature at Tehran University but quit before he had defended his dissertation in 1951. In 1950, he married Simin Daneshvar, a well-known Persian novelist. Jalal and Simin were infertile, a topic that was reflected in some of Jalal&#x27;s works.

He died in Asalem, a rural region in the north of Iran, inside a cottage which was built almost entirely by himself. He was buried in Firouzabadi mosque in Ray, Iran. According to rumors he was poisoned by SAVAK which was vehemently contradicted by his wife who confirmed the official cause of death, pulmonary embolism due to alcohol and nicotine abuse. 

In 2010, the Tehran Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Department bought the house in which both Jalal Al-e Ahmad and his brother Shams were born and lived.

==Political life==

===Gharbzadegi: &quot;Westoxification&quot; ===
Al-e-Ahmad is perhaps most famous for using the term Gharbzadegi, originally coined by Ahmad Fardid and variously translated in English as weststruckness, westoxification and occidentosis - in a book by the same name &quot;Occidentosis: A Plague from the West&quot;, self-published by Al-e Ahmad in Iran in 1962. In the book Al-e-Ahmad developed a &quot;stinging critique of Western technology and by implication of Western `civilization` itself&quot;. He argued that the decline of traditional Iranian industries such as carpet weaving was the beginning of Western &quot;economic and existential victories over the East.&quot; His criticism of Western technology and mechanization was influenced, through Ahmad Fardid, by Heidegger, and he also considered Jean-Paul Sartre as another seminal philosophical influence. There was also Ernst Jünger, to whom Jalal ascribes a major part in the genealogy of his famous book, and he goes on to say &quot;Junger and I were both exploring more or less the same subject, but from two viewpoints. We were addressing the same question, but in two languages.&quot; Throughout the twelve chapters of the essay, Al-e Ahmad defines gharbzadegi as a contagious disease, lists its initial symptoms and details its etiology, diagnoses local patients, offers a prognosis for patients in other localities, and consults with other specialists to suggest a rather hazy antidote.

His message was embraced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, who wrote in 1971 that &quot;The poisonous culture of imperialism [is] penetrating to the depths of towns and villages throughout the Muslim world, displacing the culture of the Qur&#x27;an, recruiting our youth en masse to the service of foreigners and imperialists...&quot;

and became part of the ideology of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which emphasized nationalization of industry, independence in all areas of life from both the Soviet and the Western world, and &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; in economics. He was also one of the main influences of Ahmadinejad.

==Discourse of authenticity==

Ali Mirsepasi believes that Al-e Ahmad is concerned with the discourse of authenticity along with Shariati. According to Mirsepasi, Jalal extended his critiques of the hegemonic power of the West. The critique is centered on the concept of westoxication. Al-e Ahmad attacks secular intellectuals with the concept. He believes that the intellectuals could not construct effectively an authentically Iranian modernity. On this occasion, he posed the concept of “return” to an Islamic culture which is authentic at the same time. Al-e Ahmad believed that to avoid the homogenizing and alienating forces of modernity, it is necessary to return to the roots of Islamic culture. In fact, Al Ahmad wanted to reimagine modernity with Iranian-Islamic tradition.

===Political activism===
Al-e-Ahmad joined the communist Tudeh Party along with his mentor Khalil Maleki shortly after World War II. They &quot;were too independent for the party&quot; and resigned in protest over the lack of democracy and the &quot;nakedly pro-Soviet&quot; support for Soviet demands for oil concession and occupation of Iranian Azerbaijan. They formed an alternative party the Socialist Society of the Iranian Masses in January 1948 but disbanded it a few days later when Radio Moscow attacked it, unwilling to publicly oppose &quot;what they considered the world&#x27;s most progressive nations.&quot; Nonetheless, the dissent of Al-e-Ahmad and Maleki marked &quot;the end of the near hegemony of the party over intellectual life.&quot;

He later helped found the pro-Mossadegh Tudeh Party, one of the component parties of the National Front, and then in 1952 a new party called the Third Force. Following the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état Al-e-Ahmad was imprisoned for several years and &quot;so completely lost faith in party politics&quot; that he signed a letter of repentance published in an Iranian newspaper declaring that he had &quot;resigned from the Third Force, and completely abandoned politics.&quot; However, he remained a part of the Third Force political group, attending its meetings, and continuing to follow the political mentorship of Khalil Maleki until their deaths in 1969. In 1963, visited Israel for two weeks, and in his account of his trip stated that the fusion of the religious and the secular he discerned in Israel afforded a potential model for the state of Iran. Despite his relationship with the secular Third Force group, Al-e-Ahmad became more sympathetic to the need for religious leadership in the transformation of Iranian politics, especially after the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1963.

==Literary life==

Al-e-Ahmad used a colloquial style in prose. In this sense, he is a follower of avant-garde Persian novelists like Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh. Since the subjects of his works (novels, essays, travelogues, and ethnographic monographs) are usually cultural, social, and political issues, symbolic representations and sarcastic expressions are regular patterns in his books. A distinct characteristic of his writings is his honest examination of subjects, regardless of possible reactions from political, social, or religious powers.

On the invitation of Richard Nelson Frye, Al-e-Ahmad spent a summer at Harvard University, as part of a Distinguished Visiting Fellowship program established by Henry Kissinger for supporting promising Iranian intellectuals.

Al-e-Ahmad rigorously supported Nima Yushij (father of modern Persian poetry) and had an important role in the acceptance of Nima&#x27;s revolutionary style.

In &quot;a short but prolific career&quot;, his writings &quot;came to fill over thirty-five volumes.&quot;
===Novels and novellas===
*&quot;The School Principal&quot;
*&quot;By the Pen&quot;
*&quot;The Tale of Beehives&quot;
*&quot;The Cursing of the Land&quot;
*&quot;A Stone upon a Grave&quot;

Many of his novels, including the first two in the list above, have been translated into English.

* &quot;Of our suffering&quot;
* &quot;Someone else&#x27;s child&quot;

*&quot;Owrazan&quot;
*&quot;Tat people of Block-e-Zahra&quot;

<text>The National Graphical Association (NGA) was a trade union representing typographers and related workers in the United Kingdom.

==History==
The union was formed in 1964 by the merger of two long-term rival unions, the Typographical Association and the London Typographical Society. It was joined by a large number of small craft print unions including the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers, National Union of Press Telegraphists, Association of Correctors of the Press, Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers. Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Engravers (SLADE) and National Union of Wallcoverings and Allied Trades. By 1982 it had a membership of 136,300.

In 1978 the General Secretary Joe Wade asserted in a letter to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; that &quot;recruitment through secondary boycott has been a legitimate trade union tactic for many years.&quot;

The NGA merged with the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades in 1991 to form the Graphical, Paper and Media Union.

==Election results==

<doc id="892876" wikidata="Q636365" url="?curid=892876" title="War of the League of Cambrai">
<text>The War of the League of Cambrai, sometimes known as the War of the Holy League and several other names, was fought from February 1508 to December 1516 as part of the Italian Wars of 1494–1559. The main participants of the war, who fought for its entire duration, were France, the Papal States, and the Republic of Venice; they were joined at various times by nearly every significant power in Western Europe, including Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Florence, the Duchy of Ferrara, and the Swiss.

The war started with the &quot;Italienzug&quot; of Maximilian I, King of the Romans, crossing into Venetian territory in February 1508 with his army on the way to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in Rome. Meanwhile, Pope Julius II, intending to curb Venetian influence in northern Italy, brought together the League of Cambrai—an anti-Venetian alliance consisting of him, Maximilian I, Louis XII of France, and Ferdinand II of Aragon—which was formally concluded in December 1508. Although the League was initially successful, friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510; Julius then allied himself with Venice against France.

The Veneto–Papal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about the division of the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the coalition in favor of an alliance with France. Under the leadership of Francis I, who had succeeded Louis on the throne of France, the French and Venetians would regain the territory they had lost in a campaign culminating in the Battle of Marignano in 1515; the treaties of Noyon (August 1516) and Brussels (December 1516), which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy to the &quot;status quo&quot; of 1508.

== Timeline ==
This is an overview of notable events including battles during the war.
;Prelude (1506–1508)
* July 1506 – March 1507: A popular revolt in Genoa expelled the city&#x27;s pro-French nobility to Savona. By late November 1506, king Louis XII of France was planning a military expedition to bring Genoa back under pro-French control.
* 28 March 1507: The Genoese revolutionary council declared war on the king of France, who had already reached Piedmont with his army.
* 22–29 April 1507: Siege of Genoa. French victory over the Genoese revolutionaries. Louis arranged a triumphal entry and forced the Genoese to swear loyalty to him.
* April 1507: The Imperial Diet of Konstanz and Maximilian I declared Louis XII of France an enemy of Christianity and a threat to Italy, and requested (and received) funding for an &quot;Italienzug&quot;. Louis XII denied seeking war with the Empire or the Papacy.
* 14 May 1507: Louis XII left Genoa and held a similar triumphal entry in Milan.
* 28 June 1507: Louis XII of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon met for six days at Savona to lay the groundwork for the League of Cambrai against Venice, most likely intending to include Maximilian and the Pope into the coalition. Ferdinand departed for Spain on 3 July.
* July 1507: The Imperial Diet promised Maximilian 12,000 troops for his &quot;Italienzug&quot;. Because this was not enough to challenge the French in Milan, as he originally intended, Maximilian later ended up deciding to attack Venice instead on the grounds of refusing to ally with him against France, and refusing him passage to Rome.
;Maximilian&#x27;s &quot;Italienzug&quot; (1508)
* 24 January 1508: Maximilian requested permission to march to Rome through Venetian territory, but the Venetians suspected the ruse and prepared for war.
* 4 February 1508: Maximilian I proclaimed himself Holy Roman Emperor in Trento.
* Early February 1508: Maximilian declared war on Venice. Venice requested France, then still their ally, to send aid, which Chaumont did in the form of several thousand troops from Milan.
* 20–21 February 1508: Imperial troops invaded Venice, sacking Ampezzo and besieging the Castello di Botestagno.
* 23 February 1508: Imperials captured Pieve di Cadore.
* 24 February 1508: Skirmish at Chiusa di Venas, Imperial victory over Venice.
* 27 February 1508: Imperials captured Castello di Botestagno.
* 2 March 1508: Battle of Cadore. Venetian victory over the Emperor.
* March–May 1508: Successful Venetian counter-offensives into Imperial territory. The Venetians captured Trieste on 6 May.
* Summer 1508: Venice agreed to a separate three-year truce with Maximilian without the knowledge or consent of Louis of France. Angered by this &#x27;betrayal&#x27;, Louis sought to punish the Venetians, and started contemplating a Franco-German alliance with Maximilian against Venice.
;War of the League of Cambrai proper (1508–1510)
* Late November – 10 December 1508: The League of Cambrai was formally concluded.
* 10 May 1509: Battle of Casaloldo: Venetian victory over Mantua (Cambrai).
* 14 May 1509: Battle of Agnadello. French (Cambrai) victory over Venice.
* 15–30 September 1509: Siege of Padua. Venetian victory over the League of Cambrai.
* 26–29 November 1509: Battle of the citadel of Vicenza. Venetian victory over the Imperials (Cambrai).
* 22 December 1509: Battle of Polesella. Ferrarese (Cambrai) victory over Venice.
* February 1510: Pope Julius II left the League of Cambrai, and signed peace with Venice. 
* May 1510: French, Ferrarese, and Imperial troops invaded Venetian territory.
* July 1510: The Pope and Venice formed an alliance and went on a counter-offensive. The League of Cambrai fell apart, leaving only France and Ferrara at war with Venice and the Pope.
;Ferrarese War (1510–1511)

* 23 May 1511: French troops captured Bologna after an anti-Papal revolt.
* Late May 1511: French troops recaptured Mirandola.
;War of the Holy League proper (1511–1514)
* October 1511: Pope Julius II proclaimed the new Holy League against France, including the Papal States, Venice, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and the Swiss Confederacy.
* 18 February 1512: Sack of Brescia. French victory over Venice.

==Prelude==
In the aftermath of the First Italian War (1494–1498), Pope Alexander VI had, with French assistance, moved to consolidate Papal control over central Italy by seizing the Romagna. The brother of the Pope, Cesare Borgia, acting as Gonfalonier of the Papal armies, had expelled the Bentivoglio family from Bologna, which they had ruled as a fief, and was well on his way towards establishing a permanent Borgia state in the region when Alexander died on 18 August 1503. Although Cesare managed to seize the remnants of the Papal treasury for his own use, he was unable to secure Rome itself, as French and Spanish armies converged on the city in an attempt to influence the Papal conclave; the election of Pius III (who soon died, to be replaced by Julius II) stripped Cesare of his titles and relegated him to commanding a company of men-at-arms. Sensing Cesare&#x27;s weakness, the dispossessed lords of the Romagna offered to submit to the Republic of Venice in exchange for aid in regaining their dominions; the Venetian Senate accepted and had taken possession of Rimini, Faenza, and a number of other cities by the end of 1503.

Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare, first in Bologna and later in Ravenna, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized. The Republic of Venice, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute, refused to surrender the cities themselves. In response, Julius concluded an alliance with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice; the death of Isabella I of Castile (26 November 1504) and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance (the Treaty of Blois (1504), which had ended the Italian Wars of 1499–1504, became a &#x27;dead letter&#x27;), but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities, except for the three key towns of Rimini, Faenza and Cervia. Julius, although unsatisfied with his gains, did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic; for the next two years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and Perugia, which, located between Papal and Venetian territory, had in the meantime assumed a status of quasi-independence.

In 1507, Julius returned to the question of the cities in Venetian hands; once again rebuffed by the Senate, he encouraged Emperor Maximilian I to attack the Republic. Maximilian, using his journey to Rome for the Imperial coronation as a pretext, entered Venetian territory with a large army in February 1508 and advanced on Vicenza, but was defeated by a Venetian army under Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano (Battle of Cadore, 2 March 1508). A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure; Alviano not only routed the Imperial army but also seized the entire County of Gorizia, Austrian Istria (county of Pazin), as well as Trieste, Fiume, and the westernmost portions of Carniola, forcing Maximilian to conclude a truce with Venice.

==League of Cambrai==

In the spring of 1508, the Republic provoked Julius by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza; in response, the Pope called for all Christian nations to join him in an expedition to subdue Venice. On 10 December 1508, representatives of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire, and Ferdinand II of Aragon concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic. The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice&#x27;s territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories: Maximilian, in addition to regaining Gorizia, Trieste, Merania, and eastern Istria, would receive Verona, Vicenza, Padua, and the Friuli; France would annex Brescia, Crema, Bergamo, and Cremona to its Milanese possessions; Ferdinand would seize Otranto; and the remainder, including Rimini and Ravenna, would be added to the Papal States.

The danger to the Republic of Venice was imminent, so in April 1509 the Venetian Senate immediately ordered to assemble an army of about 50,000 soldiers in Pontevico, along the Oglio river, while the main Venetian generals assembled in its Castle. On 9 May 1509, Louis crossed the Adda River at the head of a French army of about 40,000 soldiers and moved rapidly into Venetian territory. To oppose him, Venice had hired a condottiere army under the command of the Orsini cousins—Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano and Niccolò di Pitigliano—but had failed to account for their disagreement on how best to stop the French advance. On 14 May, Alviano confronted the French at the Battle of Agnadello; outnumbered, he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin, who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way. Alviano, disregarding the new orders, continued the engagement; his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed. Pitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis; but his mercenary troops, hearing of Alviano&#x27;s defeat, had deserted in large numbers by the next morning, forcing him to retreat to Treviso with the remnants of the Venetian army.

The Venetian collapse was complete. Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as Brescia without encountering any significant resistance; the Venetians lost all the territory that they had accumulated in northern Italy during the previous century. The major cities that had not been occupied by the French—Padua, Verona, and Vicenza—were left undefended by Pitigliano&#x27;s withdrawal, and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto. Julius, having in the meantime issued an interdict against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic, invaded the Romagna and captured Ravenna with the assistance of Alfonso d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara. D&#x27;Este, having joined the League and been appointed Gonfalonier on 19 April, seized the Polesine for himself.

The newly arrived Imperial governors, however, quickly proved to be unpopular. In mid-July, the citizens of Padua, aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the proveditor Andrea Gritti, revolted. The landsknechts garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance, and Padua was restored to Venetian control on 17 July. The success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action. In early August, a massive Imperial army, accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops, set out from Trento into the Veneto. Because of a lack of horses, as well as general disorganization, Maximilian&#x27;s forces were slow to begin the siege of Padua, giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city. Although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua&#x27;s walls, the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian, growing impatient, lifted the siege on 1 October and withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army.

In mid-November, Pitigliano returned to the offensive, recapturing Vicenza, Este, Feltre, and Belluno; an attack on Verona failed, but Pitigliano destroyed a Papal army under Francesco II of Gonzaga in the process. Angelo Trevisan organized a river attack on Ferrara by the Venetian galley fleet, but the resulting Battle of Polesella ended in another defeat for the Republic when the Venetian ships anchored in the Po River were sunk by Ferrarese artillery.

Faced with a shortage of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them in February 1510; even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.

This apparent reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop multiple French, Ferrarese, and Imperial armies from invading Venetian territory in May 1510. Gianpaolo Baglioni and Andrea Gritti, left in command of the Venetian forces by Pitigliano&#x27;s death in January, withdrew to Padua; by 24 May, the League&#x27;s armies had taken Vicenza and the Polesine, and were advancing on Legnago. Gritti fortified Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco-Imperial army, but Louis, frustrated by Maximilian&#x27;s failure to appear in person and distracted by the death of his advisor, the Cardinal d&#x27;Amboise, abandoned his plans for a siege.

==Veneto-Papal alliance==
Julius, meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy; more significantly, alienated from Alfonso d&#x27;Este by friction over a licence for a salt monopoly in the Papal States and Alfonso&#x27;s continued forays against Venetian forces to secure his recently reacquired Polesine, he had formulated plans to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, and to add its territory to the Papal States. His own forces being inadequate for the venture, the Pope hired an army of Swiss mercenaries, ordering them to attack the French in Milan; he also invited Venice to ally with him against Louis. The Republic, facing a renewed French onslaught, readily accepted the offer.

 By July 1510, the new Veneto-Papal alliance was on the offensive. An initial attack on French-occupied Genoa failed, but Venetian troops under Lucio Malvezzo finally drove the French from Vicenza in early August, and a joint force commanded by Francesco Maria della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino, captured Modena on 17 August. Julius now excommunicated Alfonso d&#x27;Este, thus justifying an attack on the Duchy of Ferrara itself; in anticipation of his coming victory, the Pope traveled to Bologna, so as to be nearby when Ferrara was taken.

The French army, however, had been left unopposed by the Swiss (who, having arrived in Lombardy, had been bribed into leaving by Louis) and was free to march south into the heart of Italy. In early October, Charles II d&#x27;Amboise advanced on Bologna, splitting the Papal forces; by 18 October, he was only a few miles from the city. Julius now realized that the Bolognese were openly hostile to the Papacy and would not offer any resistance to the French; left with only a detachment of Venetian cavalry, he resorted to excommunicating d&#x27;Amboise, who had in the meantime been convinced by the English ambassador to avoid attacking the person of the Pope and had thus withdrawn to Ferrara.
In December 1510, a newly assembled Papal army conquered Concordia and besieged the fortress of Mirandola; d&#x27;Amboise, marching to relieve the latter, fell ill and died, briefly leaving the French in disarray; the pope took personal command of the siege, and Mirandola fell in January 1511. Alfonso d&#x27;Este, meanwhile, confronted and destroyed the Venetian forces on the Po River, leaving Bologna isolated once more; Julius, afraid of being trapped by the French, departed the city for Ravenna. Cardinal Francesco Alidosi, whom he left behind to command the defense of the city, was no better liked by the Bolognese than Julius himself had been; and when, in May 1511, a French army commanded by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio approached, the citizens of Bologna revolted, expelled Alidosi, and opened their gates to the French. Julius blamed this defeat on the Duke of Urbino, who, finding this quite unfair, proceeded to murder Alidosi in full view of the Papal guard.

==Holy League==
In October 1511, Julius proclaimed a Holy League against France. The new alliance included not only Spain and the Holy Roman Empire (which abandoned any pretense of adhering to the League of Cambrai in hopes of seizing Navarre from Queen Catherine and Lombardy from Louis), but also Henry VIII of England who, having decided to use the occasion as an excuse to expand his holdings in northern France, concluded the Treaty of Westminster—a pledge of mutual aid against the French—with Ferdinand on 17 November.

Louis now appointed his nephew, Gaston de Foix, to command the French forces in Italy. Foix proved more energetic than d&#x27;Amboise and Trivulzio had been; having checked the advance of Ramón de Cardona&#x27;s Spanish troops on Bologna, he returned to Lombardy to sack Brescia, which had rebelled against the French and garrisoned itself with Venetian troops. Aware that much of the French army would be diverted to deal with the impending English invasion, Foix and Alfonso d&#x27;Este besieged Ravenna, the last Papal stronghold in the Romagna, in hopes of forcing the Holy League into a decisive engagement. Cardona marched to relieve the city in early April 1512, and was decisively beaten in the resulting Battle of Ravenna, fought on Easter Sunday; the death of Foix during the fighting, however, left the French under the command of Jacques de la Palice, who, unwilling to continue the campaign without direct orders from Louis, contented himself with thoroughly sacking Ravenna.

By May 1512, the French position had deteriorated considerably. Julius had hired another army of Swiss mercenaries; they descended on Milan, bringing with them Maximilian Sforza, who was determined to regain control of the Duchy for his family. The French garrisons abandoned the Romagna (where the Duke of Urbino quickly captured Bologna and Parma) and retreated to Lombardy, attempting to intercept the invasion. By August, the Swiss had combined with the Venetian army and forced Trivulzio out of Milan, allowing Sforza to be proclaimed Duke with their support; La Palice was then forced to withdraw across the Alps.

In 1512 Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset led an unsuccessful English military expedition to France to reconquer Aquitaine, which England had lost during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Ferdinand of Aragon gave none of the support he had promised. While Ferdinand delayed and tried to persuade Dorset to help him to attack Navarre instead of Aquitaine, the English army&#x27;s food, beer, and pay ran out, many took to wine and became ill, and the army mutinied. Back in England, Dorset had to face a trial.

In late August, the members of the League met at Mantua to discuss the situation in Italy and the partition of territory acquired from the French. They quickly came to an agreement regarding Florence, which had angered Julius by allowing Louis to convene the Council of Pisa in its territory; at the Pope&#x27;s request, Ramon de Cardona marched into Tuscany, smashed Florentine resistance, overthrew the Florentine Republic, and installed Giuliano de&#x27; Medici as ruler of the city. On the subject of territory, however, fundamental disagreements quickly arose. Julius and the Venetians insisted that Maximilian Sforza be permitted to keep the Duchy of Milan, while Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand maneuvered to have one of their relatives installed as duke. The Pope demanded the annexation of Ferrara to the Papal States; Ferdinand objected to this arrangement, desiring the existence of an independent Ferrara to counter growing Papal power. The Emperor refused to relinquish any Imperial territory, which in his eyes included most of the Veneto, and signed an agreement with the Pope to exclude Venice entirely from the final partition; when the Republic objected, Julius threatened to reform the League of Cambrai against her. In response, Venice turned to Louis; on 23 March 1513, a treaty pledging to divide all of northern Italy between France and the Republic was signed at Blois. Pope Julius II, meanwhile, had died in February, and Cardinal Giovanni di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent and elder brother of the new ruler of Florence, was elected Pope Leo X.

==Franco-Venetian alliance==
In late May 1513, a French army commanded by Louis de la Trémoille crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan; at the same time, Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano and the Venetian army marched west from Padua. The unpopularity of Maximilian Sforza, who was seen by the Milanese as a puppet of his Swiss mercenaries, enabled the French to move through Lombardy with little resistance; Trémoille, having seized Milan, besieged the remaining Swiss in Novara. On 6 June, the French were attacked by a Swiss relief army at the Battle of Novara, and were routed despite having superior numbers. Detachments of the Swiss army pursued the fleeing French over the Alps and had reached Dijon before being bribed into withdrawing.

The rout at Novara inaugurated a period of defeats for the French alliance. English troops under Henry VIII besieged Thérouanne, defeated La Palice at the Battle of the Spurs, and captured Tournai. In Navarre, resistance to Ferdinand&#x27;s invasion collapsed; he rapidly consolidated his hold over the entire region and moved to support another English offensive in the Guyenne. James IV of Scotland invaded England at the behest of Louis; but he failed to draw Henry&#x27;s attention from France, and his death—and the Scots&#x27; catastrophic defeat—at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, ended Scotland&#x27;s brief involvement in the war.

Meanwhile, Alviano, unexpectedly left without French support, retreated into the Veneto, pursued closely by the Spanish army under Cardona; while the Spanish were unable to capture Padua in the face of determined Venetian resistance, they penetrated deep into Venetian territory and by late September were in sight of Venice itself. Cardona attempted a bombardment of the city that proved largely ineffective; then, having no boats with which to cross the Venetian Lagoon, turned back for Lombardy. Alviano, having been reinforced by hundreds of volunteers from the Venetian nobility, pursued Cardona and confronted him outside Vicenza on 7 October; in the resulting Battle of La Motta, the Venetian army was decisively defeated, with many prominent noblemen cut down outside the city walls as they attempted to flee. Cardona and Alviano continued to skirmish in the Friuli for the remainder of 1513 and through 1514.

The death of Louis XII on 1 January 1515 brought Francis I to the throne; having assumed the title of Duke of Milan at his coronation, Francis immediately moved to reclaim his holdings in Italy. By July, Francis had assembled an army in the Dauphiné; a combined Swiss and Papal force moved north from Milan to block the Alpine passes against him, but Francis, following the advice of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, avoided the main passes and marched instead through the valley of the Stura. The French vanguard surprised the Milanese cavalry at Villafranca, capturing Prospero Colonna; meanwhile, Francis and the main body of the French confronted the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano on 13 September. The Swiss advance initially made headway; however, Francis&#x27;s superiority in cavalry and artillery, together with the timely arrival of Alviano (who had successfully avoided Cardona&#x27;s army at Verona) on the morning of 14 September, led to a decisive victory for Francis and the Venetians.

==Aftermath==
After the victory at Marignano, Francis advanced on Milan, capturing the city on 4 October and removing Sforza from the throne. In December, he met with Leo at Bologna; the pope, who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his Swiss mercenaries, surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Francis and Modena to the Duke of Ferrara. In return, Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the Duchy of Urbino. Finally, the Treaty of Noyon, signed by Francis and Charles V in August 1516, recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples, removing Spain from the war.

Maximilian held out, making another attempt to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into negotiations with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for Cremona), effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the growing rivalry between the House of Valois and the House of Habsburg, and the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, would soon lead to the Italian War of 1521–26.

<text>Kimberworth is a suburb of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. It is located in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, about 2 miles (3.5 km) north-west of Rotherham town centre and 5 miles (7.6 km) north-east of Sheffield. Until 1974 it was in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

==History==
Kimberworth is mentioned in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, where it is noted as &quot;Chiberworde&quot;. Kimberworth castle, now demolished, was located near The Drawbridge pub. The monks at nearby Kirkstead Abbey were smelting iron from around 1160, the rest of the history of this area is heavily influenced by industrial developments, especially in iron, steel and coal.

There is evidence of human activity in this area going back 5000 years. The area was settled by Brigantes, before the arrival of the Romans. The Roman expansion north was halted by the Brigantes forts at Kimberworth and Wincobank.

The present manor house at Kimberworth was built in 1694 by the Kent family, long prominent at Kimberworth, who married with, amongst others, the Rawson family of Upperthorpe and the Creswick family that had owned land at Owlerton since the fourteenth century.

Kimberworth was formerly a township and chapelry, in 1866 Kimberworth became a separate civil parish, in 1894 the parish was abolished and merged with Rotherham and Wentworth. In 1891 the parish had a population of 19,566. It is now in the unparished area of Rotherham.

==Places of worship==
The Kimberworth area has several churches, the most prominent being St Thomas&#x27;s Anglican Church on Church Street, construction of which was started in 1842. The Salvation Army has a meeting hall on High Street, this is also used by the 1st Rotherham Cub Scout pack. Kimberworth United Reformed Church met in a building on Kimberworth Road overlooking Bradgate Park (Church closed in 2010).

==Landmarks==
* Thundercliffe Grange – 1770s


==Schools==
Kimberworth was served by Kimberworth Comprehensive School and Old Hall Comprehensive School until 2004 when they were merged to form Winterhill School, built on the site of the latter.

==Notable people==
*Dean Andrews, actor who appeared in &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, used to live in Kimberworth
*David Seaman, England football goalkeeper lived in nearby Ferham and attended Kimberworth Comprehensive School
*Rowland Suddaby (1912–1972), British artist and illustrator, born there

<doc id="892885" wikidata="Q846548" url="?curid=892885" title="Six Flags New England">
<text>Six Flags New England, formerly known as Gallup&#x27;s Grove(1870–1886), Riverside Grove (1887–1911), Riverside Park (1912–1995) and Riverside: The Great Escape (1996–1999), is an amusement park located in Agawam, Massachusetts. Opening in the late 19th century, it is the oldest amusement park in the Six Flags chain, acquired by Premier Parks in 1996 and rebranded Six Flags New England in 2000. Superman The Ride is among the park&#x27;s most notable rides, having appeared as a highly ranked roller coaster in the annual Golden Ticket Awards from &quot;Amusement Today&quot; since the ride opened in 2000.

==History==

Throughout much of the 20th century, the park was known as Riverside Park. It began as a picnic grove in 1870 named Gallup&#x27;s Grove. It was briefly changed to Riverside Grove, and then eventually Riverside Park in 1912. Prior to 1900, most of the park&#x27;s patrons arrived via steamship. The Springfield Street Railway extended its line to the park in 1900 and, although Riverside was at the end of the Springfield Street Railway, it was not owned by the railway and is, therefore, not considered a trolley park, contrary to published reports.

In the early 1900s, a few mechanical rides and a carousel were added. The park was purchased in 1911 by Henry J. Perkins who transformed the park from a picnic grove to an amusement park. He built the park&#x27;s first roller coaster, The Giant Dip, in 1912, which proved to be so popular that another coaster, The Greyhound, was added in 1915. Under Perkins&#x27; ownership, the park continued to prosper and additional amusements were added, including a 300-foot-diameter pool that became known as Lake Takadip. The original Giant Dip coaster was replaced in 1920 by a new, more thrilling coaster that was twice the size of the Giant and was eventually named Lightning. A third coaster, Whirlwind Racer, was added in 1928.

===Closure and re-opening===
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 took its toll on the park and by 1931 it had gone into foreclosure. For the 1932 season, the park operated only Wednesday through Sunday, and in 1933 it closed. Several attempts to reopen the park failed and it remained closed through 1939, although the grounds were occasionally used for company picnics. A drive-in movie theater operated in the parking lot from 1937 to 1939.

Edward Carroll Sr. purchased the abandoned park in 1939 and after making improvements, reopened Riverside Park on May 29, 1940. Carroll is credited with rescuing Riverside and turning it into the largest theme park in New England. He purchased the plans and cars of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair Cyclone Roller Coaster and opened a new coaster in 1941. That coaster, now known as Thunderbolt, is operating at the park and is the oldest coaster — in its original location — within the entire Six Flags chain of theme parks. The park continued to add new rides and removed some older ones. The theater and bowling alley were removed in the late 1950s, making Riverside Park a seasonal attraction.

Carroll took a liking to auto racing, a sport that was gaining popularity in the Northeast after World War II, and added it to his slate of attractions at Riverside, building the Riverside Park Speedway in 1948, replacing an open-air bandstand. The 1960s was a popular period for stock car racing at Riverside Park. NASCAR began to hold events at Riverside Park Speedway in 1976. In 1968 the park added its first steel coaster called the Wildcat and in 1977, Riverside Park added its first looping roller coaster, The Loop Coaster, later known as Black Widow. After a new roller rink was built in 1978, the former roller rink building, opened in 1916, was demolished in 1979 to expand the park. In 1998, the rink was closed and is now the human resources building. Edward J. Carrol Sr died in 1979, but the park continued to be successful throughout the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1979 the park invested in an Arrow Development log flume known as Red River Rapids. It became the park&#x27;s first water ride. It was later renamed Poland Spring Plunge. By the 1980s, the park stopped selling individual ride tickets and began charging a &quot;pay one price&quot; admission.

Six years after the opening of Black Widow, the Wildcat was removed and moved to the late Rocky Point Park in Rhode Island. In 1983, Riverside Park added its third roller coaster, which was also the park&#x27;s second wooden coaster. The owners originally wanted a coaster exactly like the Coney Island Cyclone, but space was limited, so the coaster would need to take up less space and would have sharper twists and turns. It became known as the Riverside Cyclone. In 1987, Riverside attempted to build a white-water rafting ride called the Lost River Water Ride. Plagued with problems, the attraction never opened and was subsequently abandoned. A majority of the ride was demolished in 1989 to make way for Wild River Falls, a waterslide complex consisting of three sets of slides: Riptide, Blue Lightning and Pipeline. A popular attraction, Wild River Falls remained in operation until the opening of the Island Kingdom Waterpark in 1997. 

In 1994, Riverside partnered with Lady Luck Gaming in a proposal to build a hotel and dockside casino complex at the park, one of several competing casino proposals in the state. The plan died after Agawam voters rejected a non-binding referendum in support of casino gambling in November.

===Purchase by Premier Parks===
During the 1996 season, the track on the Musik Express was damaged and the attraction remained closed for a portion of the year. A Chance Chaos was ordered and was scheduled to open for the 1997 season. In December of 1996, the Carroll family agreed to sell the park to Premier Parks of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In the Spring of 1997, Premier Parks renamed the park to Riverside: The Great Escape.

Under Premier Parks, various changes were made to the park. For the 1997 season, the new owners invested more than $20 million on general improvements and several new attractions. A new front entrance to the park was constructed, which included the expansion and renovation of Main Street U.S.A. and the relocation and renovation of the carousel. The Island Kingdom Waterpark was an expansion to the park that featured a children&#x27;s water play area, various slides, and a wave pool. This expansion was added to the south end of the park next to the park&#x27;s log flume in the location of the parking lot. To make room for this expansion, the parking lot was relocated to the other side of the roadway in former farmland and significantly expanded.

Other additions in 1997 included Mind Eraser (later renamed to The Riddler Revenge) and Shipwreck Falls. In the process of renovation, some older rides such as the Bayern Kurve and The Monorail were removed. The Southern Center midway was rethemed to a 1950s city named Rockville.

In 1998, the water park was further expanded, with additions such as a lazy river, another children&#x27;s play structure called Hook&#x27;s Lagoon, a speed slide tower called Cannonball, a family raft slide called Swiss Family Toboggan, and a multi-slide tower called Big Kahuna. The park also added The Hellevator, an S&amp;S Worldwide Turbo Drop tower measuring 21 stories tall, which was originally painted red.

===Six Flags===
On April 1, 1998, Premier Parks acquired the Six Flags chain of parks from Time Warner. The park continued to be known as &quot;Riverside&quot; until the end of the 1999 season. In 1999, the waterpark was doubled in size. Additions included a new slide tower named Shark Attack and a second wave pool called Hurricane Bay. The park also added a Hopkins river raft ride named Blizzard River to the North End, replacing a set of dry slides and the old Bumper Cars. Blizzard River was themed to incorporate the Penguin character from the Batman franchise; however, the name of the ride was never changed when the park was allowed to use characters from DC Comics on their rides. A new western area called Crackaxle Canyon was added and included four rides, three of which were new to the park. The Riverside Park Speedway was also removed. 

In 2000, Riverside was rebranded &quot;Six Flags New England,&quot; reflecting similar changes made at other Six Flags properties. On the former site of the racetrack, a new DC Comics-themed section of the park was installed, called &quot;DC Super Hero Adventures.&quot; The area featured several new rides, including Superman – Ride of Steel, a hypercoaster designed by Intamin. The park also added Flashback, a relocated Vekoma Boomerang from Kentucky Kingdom, which replaced the Black Widow and Rotor in the North End. Two S&amp;S Worldwide Combo drop tower rides were added next to the Hellevator; the entire drop tower complex was painted white and named Scream. A pedestrian bridge was also constructed over the roadway in front of the park to provide a safer connection between the parking lot and front entrance.

In 2003, the water park was renamed to Hurricane Harbor and saw the addition of the Tornado water slide. 

Mr. Six&#x27;s Pandemonium, a Gerstlauer spinning coaster, was added for the 2005 season in the North End of the park. The Mr. Six name was dropped from the attraction ahead of the 2007 season. At the end of the 2005 season, the Poland Spring Plunge log flume and ferris wheel were removed. 

In 2006, Splash Water Falls and Catapult, an S&amp;S Power Sky Swatter, were added to the park, two relocated rides from the recently closed Six Flags AstroWorld. Splash Water Falls replaced the log flume and ferris wheel in the South End of the park, and Catapult was located in the North End of the park near Cyclone.

In 2007, two new children&#x27;s areas were introduced to the park: Wiggles World and Thomas Town. Wiggles World was located on the site of the former Tiny Timber Town children&#x27;s section, which saw the introduction of a few new rides and attractions but also consisted of a few rethemed attractions. Thomas Town was located near the front gate of the park and included three rides and a splash pad.

In 2008, Six Flags New England was set to open The Dark Knight Coaster, an indoor MACK Wild Mouse coaster based on the upcoming film of the same name. The park&#x27;s other Batman-based attraction had its name briefly changed from Batman – The Dark Knight to Batman: The Ride to avoid confusion. However, due to apparent permit issues, the ride was canceled and dismantled, being sent to Six Flags Mexico. The ride would have cost the park $7.5 million in exchange for bringing $280,000 in taxes for the state of Massachusetts. The cancellation angered the city of Agawam, which stated that issues with the ride were not evident. The park then announced the new &quot;Glow in the Park Parade&quot;. On November 8, 2008, the Town of Agawam allowed Six Flags the right to build roller coasters up to in height.

At the end of the 2008 season, it was announced that Superman – Ride of Steel would be rethemed to Bizarro. The track was repainted purple with dark blue supports, and multiple special effects were added; including building structures that give riders the impression of speeding through a city, rings in the shape of Bizarro&#x27;s S shield that the train passes through, and flame effects. Two new trains with on-board audio were purchased. Bizarro opened on May 22, 2009 at the start of Memorial Day weekend.

In 2010, a new children&#x27;s area called Mr. Six&#x27;s Splash Island was added to Hurricane Harbor. This increased the number of children&#x27;s areas in the park to four. At the end of the 2010 season, Six Flags began removing various intellectual properties from their parks. Wiggles World was rethemed to Kidzopolis ahead of the 2011 season. Thomas Town, because of low guest foot traffic due to its location close to the front gate of the park, was closed following the end of the 2010 season.

In 2011, Gotham City Gauntlet: Escape From Arkham Asylum opened up in the DC Super Hero Adventures section of the park. This ride replaced the football field and was placed on the same plot of land that the canceled Dark Knight Coaster was supposed to be built on. The same year, the &quot;Mr. Six&#x27;s&quot; portion of Mr. Six&#x27;s Splash Island was dropped, effectively renaming the area to Splash Island. 

In late August 2011, it was announced that Goliath would be added to the park for the 2012 season in the location of Shipwreck Falls, a water ride located in the North End of the park. Shipwreck Falls closed permanently toward the end of the 2011 season. Goliath opened in the Crackaxle Canyon section of the park on May 25, 2012, as well as a new restaurant known as JB&#x27;s Smokehouse. 

A month before opening day in 2013, Catapult was unexpectedly removed and scrapped. The park announced ahead of the season that the former Thomas Town would reopen for the 2013 season as Whistlestop Park. In May of that same year, a new water ride opened in Hurricane Harbor known as Bonzai Pipelines. At the conclusion of the 2013 season, Taz&#x27;s DareDevil Dive and Twister, a HUSS Topspin located in Rockville, were removed. 

New England SkyScreamer opened in 2014 and, at the time of its opening, was the world&#x27;s largest swing ride at 408 feet in height. The SkyWay attraction permanently closed at the conclusion of the 2014 season.

On July 20, 2014, Cyclone permanently closed. Construction signs were quickly put up, and, during August of the same year, it was announced that Rocky Mountain Construction would transform the ride into a steel hybrid coaster, which would include three inversions and a steeper drop. Wicked Cyclone opened in May 2015. 

In 2016, two new attractions were opened: Fireball and Superman The Ride. Fireball, a Larson Loop attraction, was installed in the former location of Twister. Bizarro was transformed back into Superman, which included a new red track color and other effects. 

In 2017, The Joker, a 4D FreeFly coaster, was installed on the former site of Splash Water Falls, which closed toward the end of the 2016 season. Mind Eraser, the park&#x27;s SLC, received new trains with an updated restraint style. Superman The Ride had a limited run of offering Oculus Rift goggles to enhance the ride experience. Buzzsaw closed at the end of the 2017 season. 

Harley Quinn Spinsanity opened in May 2018. To make room for it, the Tea Cups were moved to the former location of Buzzsaw and is now classified as an attraction in Rockville. The South End was transformed into Gotham City. This included retheming Mind Eraser to The Riddler Revenge, which received a new color scheme with green track and yellow supports. 

For the 2019 season, Cyborg: Hyper Drive, a spinning flat ride, was installed inside the former Hall of Justice building in the DC Super Hero Adventures area of the park. This ride is the first to include the fictional character Grid, a sentient cybernetic system and the arch-nemesis of Cyborg, in Six Flags&#x27; DC character roster. Kryptonite Kollider, formerly known as The Joker&#x27;s Wildcard, was removed at the end of the season.

For the 2020 season, the park announced the addition of Supergirl Sky Flyer, a Zamperla Endeavour located on the site of the former Kryptonite Kollider. As a result of the park not opening for the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening of Supergirl Sky Flyer was to delayed to May 2021. The DC Super Hero Adventures section of the park was rethemed to DC Universe, which features newly installed superhero statues and freshly painted buildings. 

Goliath was left standing but not operating (SBNO) for the 2021 season and was removed from the park map. In July 2021, a tree fell onto Fireball during a thunderstorm, extensively damaging the attraction and leaving it closed for the rest of the season. Both Goliath and Fireball were scrapped prior to the 2022 season. The plot of land occupied by Goliath was left as a large grass area and known as Crackaxle Commons for the 2023 and 2024 seasons.

Before the start of the 2024 season, Kontiki was removed from the park. Bonzai Pipelines was left SBNO for the 2023 and 2024 seasons, and Typhoon was left SBNO for the 2024 season. Both attractions — as well as Tomahawk, the park&#x27;s HUSS Frisbee — were removed ahead of the 2025 season.

On August 15, 2024, a replacement for Goliath was announced. Quantum Accelerator is an Intamin Straddle Coaster that will open in 2025, featuring two launches up to 45 MPH and 11 airtime moments.

==Attractions==
Six Flags New England is home to many rides and attractions, including Superman: The Ride. Superman: The Ride is tall and drops into a tunnel, reaching a top speed of . It is considered one of the best steel roller coasters in the world according to the trade magazine &quot;Amusement Today&quot;, which awarded it the prestigious Golden Ticket award in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

==Six Flags Hurricane Harbor==
Hurricane Harbor is a water park located within Six Flags New England. The waterpark opened in 1997 as Island Kingdom and was rebranded Hurricane Harbor in 2003. It features a number of family-oriented rides as well as thrill rides. For the 2020 season, Bonzai Beach is being expanded and renamed to Buccaneer Beach. This area is to include a larger bathhouse facility and a new pool.

==Park entertainment==

During the park&#x27;s branding as a Six Flags in 2000, the Looney Tunes characters were added to the park. The line-up of Looney Tunes characters includes: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester, Foghorn Leghorn, Porky Pig, Petunia Pig, Pepé Le Pew, Roadrunner, Wile E. Coyote, Marvin the Martian, Taz, Granny, Lola Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Speedy Gonzales, Yosemite Sam and Gossamer.

In 2006, the park underwent a massive expansion in the entertainment department when Mark Shapiro took control of Six Flags. With this expansion, Six Flags New England has added &quot;Justice League&quot; characters, along with the Hall of Justice. In 2007, enemies of the Justice League known as the Legion of Doom came to Six Flags. This addition brought the following characters to the park: Batman, Robin, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Hawkgirl, Green Lantern, The Flash, The Joker, The Riddler, Sinestro, Cheetah, Lex Luthor and Captain Cold. The Hall of Justice is located in the building where the Jokers Wild Card flat ride used to be, transforming it into a secret lair. Times are posted outside indicating when guests will be able to meet the characters and pose for pictures. However, the Hall of Justice building has recently become the home of Cyborg: Hyper Drive.

The park also has some of the characters from Mystery Inc including Scooby-Doo, his best friend Shaggy Rogers and his nephew Scrappy-Doo.

In the 2008 season, the Glow in the Park Parade was introduced. It was the unique brainchild of world-renowned creative director Gary Goddard and featured five custom-designed floats, 65 performers, and more than 35 support staff members and technicians. Each float was adorned with vibrant-multicolor lights that illuminate the park and surrounded the streets with custom-composed cirque-inspired music. The parade featured drummers, puppeteers, singers, dancers, and kinetic stilt walkers to create an unparalleled nighttime spectacular. The parade did not return in the 2009 season, but it did return in 2010. The parade never got to complete its full-season run in 2010. It was canceled in July after new management took over the Six Flags Corporate office.

From 2001 to 2014, Six Flags New England hosted a series of outdoor summer concerts. Additionally, from 2006 to 2013, WKSS hosted their annual Kiss 95.7 Summer Kickoff Concert at the park, and from 2010 to 2013, WKCI-FM hosted KC 101&#x27;s Ticket to Ride concert.

== Fright Fest ==
During the month of October, the park gets transformed for its annual Halloween festival, Fright Fest. This transformation include the addition of Halloween decorations to several of its midway areas (making them Haunt Zones with roaming characters monsters), several shows and five premium haunted attractions: Nightmares, Terror Tales, The Aftermath: Zombies Revenge, Slasher Circus 3D and Midnight Mansion. In early 2009, Six Flags New England received an award within the chain for the best Fright Fest of 2008.

<doc id="892886" wikidata="Q5633676" url="?curid=892886" title="HMS Palomares">
<text>HMS &quot;Palomares&quot; was a British anti-aircraft ship of the Second World War.

Originally MV &quot;Palomares&quot;, built by William Doxford &amp; Sons, Sunderland yard in 1937, it operated as a merchant fruit carrier ship (a 13.5 knot banana boat) for service on the MacAndrews Line in January 1938 with their Spanish service.

==Service==
She was purchased by the British Admiralty in 1940, as these fruit ships were considered to be fast and manoeuvrable. In 1941 the Admiralty converted her to an anti-aircraft artillery ship and subsequently to a fighter direction ship (&quot;seagoing anti-aircraft auxiliaries&quot;). Most likely the conversion took place at Fairfields yard in Govan on the River Clyde with her sister ship .

In March 1942, she sailed with &quot;Pozarica&quot;, and the corvettes , , and for the port of Seyðisfjörður in Iceland

In June 1942, she sailed as an escort in Convoy PQ 17, where 25 out 36 ships were lost to the enemy, while working around Murmansk and Archangel.

In November 1942, HMS &quot;Palomares&quot; took part in the Operation Torch landings in Algiers as an anti-aircraft ship. The ship left Gibraltar on the 3rd and arrived on the 8th. However the next day &quot;Palomares&quot; was hit by a bomb suffering a large number of casualties, engulfed in flames her steering gear was put out of action. Deceased seamen were transferred to the corvette for burial at sea and her steering gear was repaired by the 10th.

In September 1943, during the Salerno landings of Italy on the 9th, &quot;Palomares&quot; was a fighter direction ship, directing fighter planes with her radar system.

In January 1944, &quot;Palomares&quot; again served as a fighter direction ship during the Anzio landings. Arriving at the beachhead on the 22nd, she struck a mine and was towed back to Naples by the tugs &quot;Edenshaw&quot; and &quot;Evea&quot;.

In September 1945, &quot;Palomares&quot; was to have participated in the Malaya landings but could not, as a fire had damaged her engine room.

==Armaments and displacement==
Upon conversion to an anti-aircraft ship, HMS &quot;Palomares&quot; was equipped with eight 4-inch AA guns in four turrets and eight 2-pounder (40mm) AA guns in two quadruple mounts. 
In December 1942, to take the role of a fighter-direction ship, &quot;Palomares&quot; was fitted with radar for directing fighter aircraft.

HMS &quot;Palomares&quot; had a weight of 1,896 tons and could move at 13.5 knots.

==Returned==
Surviving the war, HMS &quot;Palomares&quot; was returned to the MacAndrews Line in 1946, where she continued service with the company until 1959. She was then sold, being renamed &quot;Mary Sven&quot; and in 1961 sold again becoming &quot;Sarabande&quot;. On 5 October 1961 following a fire she drifted aground and was wrecked.

<doc id="892887" wikidata="Q7631562" url="?curid=892887" title="Submarine-launched cruise missile">
<text>A submarine-launched cruise missile (SLCM) is a cruise missile that is launched from a submarine (especially a SSG or SSGN). Current versions are typically standoff weapons known as land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs), which are used to attack predetermined land targets with conventional or nuclear payloads. Anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) are also used, and some submarine-launched cruise missiles have variants for both functions.

==History of development==
The U.S. Navy&#x27;s first land-attack cruise missile submarines (4 SSG and 1 SSGN) deployed with the Regulus missile from 1958 until retired in 1964 with the arrival of the Polaris ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) in the Pacific. The US deployed the short-range Harpoon anti-ship missile on submarines beginning in 1981. The Soviet Navy converted 13 Whiskey-class submarines (Project 613) for the land-attack cruise missile (LACM) role in the late 1950s (Whiskey Single Cylinder, Whiskey Twin Cylinder, Whiskey Long Bin), armed with the SS-N-3 Shaddock (П-5) missile.

As Soviet SSBNs armed with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) became available in the late 1960s, the Shaddock LACM was withdrawn and an anti-ship (ASCM) version replaced it. The Echo- and Juliett-class submarines of the 1960s had a similar armament history, with the Echo I&#x27;s converted to attack submarines because they could not accommodate an anti-ship guidance radar. The SS-N-3 ASCM was eventually replaced with the SS-N-12 (P-500). Later, the Charlie- and Oscar-classes were designed to use long-range ASCMs, the SS-N-9 (P-120) and SS-N-19 (P-700) respectively. Only the Oscar-class remains in service. In 1990, it was reported that the Soviet Navy had deployed between 50 and 300 SLCMs. The current Akula- and Severodvinsk-class submarines are armed with the SS-N-21 (S-10) LACM.

Four U.S. Navy Ohio-class SSBNs were converted in the mid-2000s to be able to salvo launch up to 144 Tomahawk cruise missiles from their modified vertical launch SLBM tubes, as opposed to launching cruise missiles from torpedo tubes as is done from attack submarines. The advantage that the submarines have over guided-missile destroyers and cruisers is the ability to remain undetected and launch while submerged. Tomahawk was deployed on US Navy attack submarines beginning in 1983, originally in LACM and ASCM versions, but the ASCM version was withdrawn in the 1990s.

The USSR′s S-10 Granat subsonic cruise missiles designed by the NPO Novator may still be in service in Russia, albeit not deployed. In October 2015, Russia launched long-range Kalibr (Klub) cruise missiles from its small ships in the Caspian Sea on targets in Syria; in December, several 3M14K cruise missiles from Kalibr-PL system were fired from the improved Kilo-class submarine B-237 &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; in the Mediterranean. The deployment of Kalibr missiles, long-range, low-flying, capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads, available in land-attack, anti-ship and anti-submarine variants, was said to have altered the military balance in Europe and potentially compromised the NATO missile defence system under construction in Europe.

Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly reports that the Dolphin-class submarines are believed to be nuclear armed, offering Israel a sea-based, second strike capability. In adherence to Missile Technology Control Regime rules the US Clinton administration refused an Israeli request in 2000 to purchase Tomahawk long range SLCMs. The Federation of American Scientists and GlobalSecurity.org report that the four larger torpedo tubes are capable of launching Israeli built nuclear-armed Popeye Turbo cruise missiles

<doc id="892889" wikidata="Q684241" url="?curid=892889" title="Cirrus Airlines">
<text>Cirrus Airlines Luftfahrtgesellschaft mbH was a German regional airline with its head office in Hallbergmoos and its maintenance facilities at Saarbrücken Airport. It operated both charter and scheduled flights, the latter on behalf of Lufthansa, Swiss International Air Lines and Air Moldova. Its main bases and hubs were Saarbrücken Airport and Mannheim City Airport. The company slogan was &quot;connecting business.&quot;

==History==

Cirrus Airlines was founded in February 1995 as &quot;Cirrus Luftfahrtgesellschaft mbH&quot; and operated an executive charter business. In March 1998, Cirrus Airlines received its licence to operate scheduled passenger services between Saarbrücken Airport and Hamburg. In August 1999, Cirrus Airlines took over Cosmos Air, its Dornier 328 and the route between Mannheim and Berlin Tempelhof and Baden Air in 2000.

In February 2000, upon the 5th anniversary of Cirrus Airlines, it established a cooperative partnership with German-owned Lufthansa and became a Team Lufthansa franchise member. In April that year, Cirrus received licences to operate regularly scheduled service between Mannheim City Airport and Hamburg Airport and between Berlin and Sylt.

Cirrus steadily expanded its business, with scheduled services operating mainly from Saarbrücken Airport and Mannheim City Airport to domestic destinations. 
The following years the airline started to decentralize its operations, also flying low-density point-to-point routes and adding Embraer-Jets to its Turboprop-Fleet.

In 2004 Cirrus Airlines took over Augsburg Airways, a Lufthansa Regional member. The headquarters were consequently moved to Hallbergmoos, near Munich Airport. &quot;Cirrus Technik&quot; and &quot;Cirrus Flight Training&quot; remained at Saarbrücken Airport.

The company introduced a modified corporate identity in January 2008.
Cirrus Airlines was a company within &quot;Aviation Investment Corp.&quot; along with &quot;Cirrus Maintenance&quot; and &quot;Cirrus Service&quot;.

On 20 January 2012, the airline ceased operations and flew all aircraft back to Saarbrücken. This left some airports temporarily without scheduled service, like Hof Airport and Mannheim City Airport.

==Destinations==
Cirrus Airlines served several scheduled destinations throughout Germany and Western and Central Europe, such as Berlin-Tempelhof, London-City, Cologne/Bonn and Bern.

==Fleet==
Cirrus Airlines operated the following aircraft during its existence:

* 1 Airbus A310 
* 1 Beechcraft Super King Air 200
* 1 Boeing 737-500
* 1 Boeing 737-800
* 8 De Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8
*19 Dornier 328 (1 donated to École nationale d&#x27;aérotechnique)
* 8 Embraer ERJ-145
* 3 Embraer 170

==Incidents and accidents==
* June 28, 2006: A Cirrus Airlines Embraer 145 flying on behalf of Swiss International Air Lines overshoots the runways in Nuremberg. None of the 49 occupants on board are hurt. 

* March 19, 2008: Flight 1567 from Berlin-Tempelhof overshoots runway 27 of the Mannheim City Airport and comes to rest on a wall close to a highway. Five of the 27 people on board is hurt, and the aircraft, a Dornier 328 (D-CTOB), is severely damaged.

<doc id="892899" wikidata="Q32271" url="?curid=892899" title="Parsing expression grammar">
<text>In computer science, a parsing expression grammar (PEG) is a type of analytic formal grammar, i.e. it describes a formal language in terms of a set of rules for recognizing strings in the language. The formalism was introduced by Bryan Ford in 2004 and is closely related to the family of top-down parsing languages introduced in the early 1970s.
Syntactically, PEGs also look similar to context-free grammars (CFGs), but they have a different interpretation: the choice operator selects the first match in PEG, while it is ambiguous in CFG. This is closer to how string recognition tends to be done in practice, e.g. by a recursive descent parser.

Unlike CFGs, PEGs cannot be ambiguous; a string has exactly one valid parse tree or none. It is conjectured that there exist context-free languages that cannot be recognized by a PEG, but this is not yet proven. PEGs are well-suited to parsing computer languages (and artificial human languages such as Lojban) where multiple interpretation alternatives can be disambiguated locally, but are less likely to be useful for parsing natural languages where disambiguation may have to be global.

== Definition ==

A parsing expression is a kind of pattern that each string may either match or not match. In case of a match, there is a unique prefix of the string (which may be the whole string, the empty string, or something in between) which has been &quot;consumed&quot; by the parsing expression; this prefix is what one would usually think of as having matched the expression. However, whether a string matches a parsing expression &quot;may&quot; (because of look-ahead predicates) depend on parts of it which come after the consumed part. A parsing expression language is a set of all strings that match some specific parsing expression.

A parsing expression grammar is a collection of named parsing expressions, which may reference each other. The effect of one such reference in a parsing expression is as if the whole referenced parsing expression was given in place of the reference. A parsing expression grammar also has a designated starting expression; a string matches the grammar if it matches its starting expression.

An element of a string matched is called a &quot;terminal symbol&quot;, or terminal for short. Likewise the names assigned to parsing expressions are called &quot;nonterminal symbols&quot;, or nonterminals for short. These terms would be descriptive for generative grammars, but in the case of parsing expression grammars they are merely terminology, kept mostly because of being near ubiquitous in discussions of parsing algorithms.

=== Syntax ===
Both &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;concrete&quot; syntaxes of parsing expressions are seen in the literature, and in this article. The abstract syntax is essentially a mathematical formula and primarily used in theoretical contexts, whereas concrete syntax parsing expressions could be used directly to control a parser. The primary concrete syntax is that defined by Ford, although many tools have their own dialect of this. Other tools can be closer to using a programming-language native encoding of abstract syntax parsing expressions as their concrete syntax.

==== Atomic parsing expressions ====
The two main kinds of parsing expressions not containing another parsing expression are individual terminal symbols and nonterminal symbols. In concrete syntax, terminals are placed inside quotes (single or double), whereas identifiers not in quotes denote nonterminals:

 &quot;terminal&quot; Nonterminal &#x27;another terminal&#x27;

In the abstract syntax there is no formalised distinction, instead each symbol is supposedly defined as either terminal or nonterminal, but a common convention is to use upper case for nonterminals and lower case for terminals.

The concrete syntax also has a number of forms for classes of terminals:
* A codice_1 (period) is a parsing expression matching any single terminal.
* Brackets around a list of characters codice_2 form a parsing expression matching one of the numerated characters. As in regular expressions, these classes may also include ranges codice_3 written as a hyphen with the range endpoints before and after it. (Unlike the case in regular expressions, bracket character classes do not have codice_4 for negation; that end can instead be had via not-predicates.)
* Some dialects have further notation for predefined classes of characters, such as letters, digits, punctuation marks, or spaces; this is again similar to the situation in regular expressions.
In abstract syntax, such forms are usually formalised as nonterminals whose exact definition is elided for brevity; in Unicode, there are tens of thousands of characters that are letters. Conversely, theoretical discussions sometimes introduce atomic abstract syntax for concepts that can alternatively be expressed using composite parsing expressions. Examples of this include:
* the empty string ε (as a parsing expression, it matches every string and consumes no characters),
* end of input &quot;E&quot; (concrete syntax equivalent is codice_5), and
* failure formula_1 (matches nothing).

In the concrete syntax, quoted and bracketed terminals have backslash escapes, so that &quot;line feed or carriage return&quot; may be written codice_6. The abstract syntax counterpart of a quoted terminal of length greater than one would be the sequence of those terminals; codice_7 is the same as codice_8. The primary concrete syntax assigns no distinct meaning to terminals depending on whether they use single or double quotes, but some dialects treat one as case-sensitive and the other as case-insensitive.

==== Composite parsing expressions ====
Given any existing parsing expressions &quot;e&quot;, &quot;e&quot;1, and &quot;e&quot;2, a new parsing expression can be constructed using the following operators:
* &quot;Sequence&quot;: &quot;e&quot;1 &quot;e&quot;2
* &quot;Ordered choice&quot;: &quot;e&quot;1 / &quot;e&quot;2
* &quot;Zero-or-more&quot;: &quot;e&quot;*
* &quot;One-or-more&quot;: &quot;e&quot;+
* &quot;Optional&quot;: &quot;e&quot;?
* &quot;And-predicate&quot;: &amp;&quot;e&quot;
* &quot;Not-predicate&quot;: !&quot;e&quot;
* &quot;Group&quot;: (&quot;e&quot;)
Operator priorities are as follows, based on Table 1 in:

==== Grammars ====
In the concrete syntax, a parsing expression grammar is simply a sequence of nonterminal definitions, each of which has the form

 Identifier LEFTARROW Expression

The codice_9 is the nonterminal being defined, and the codice_10 is the parsing expression it is defined as referencing. The codice_11 varies a bit between dialects, but is generally some left-pointing arrow or assignment symbol, such as codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, or codice_15. One way to understand it is precisely as making an assignment or definition of the nonterminal. Another way to understand it is as a contrast to the right-pointing arrow → used in the rules of a context-free grammar; with parsing expressions the flow of information goes from expression to nonterminal, not nonterminal to expression.

As a mathematical object, a parsing expression grammar is a tuple formula_2, where formula_3 is the set of nonterminal symbols, formula_4 is the set of terminal symbols, formula_5 is a function from formula_3 to the set of parsing expressions on formula_7, and formula_8 is the starting parsing expression. Some concrete syntax dialects give the starting expression explicitly, but the primary concrete syntax instead has the implicit rule that the first nonterminal defined is the starting expression.

It is worth noticing that the primary dialect of concrete syntax parsing expression grammars does not have an explicit definition terminator or separator between definitions, although it is customary to begin a new definition on a new line; the codice_11 of the next definition is sufficient for finding the boundary, if one adds the constraint that a nonterminal in an codice_10 must not be followed by a codice_11. However, some dialects may allow an explicit terminator, or outright require it.

=== Example ===
This is a PEG that recognizes mathematical formulas that apply the basic five operations to non-negative integers.

Expr ← Sum
Sum ← Product ((&#x27;+&#x27; / &#x27;-&#x27;) Product)*
Product ← Power ((&#x27;*&#x27; / &#x27;/&#x27;) Power)*
Power ← Value (&#x27;^&#x27; Power)?
Value ← [0-9]+ / &#x27;(&#x27; Expr &#x27;)&#x27;

In the above example, the terminal symbols are characters of text, represented by characters in single quotes, such as codice_19 and codice_20. The range codice_21 is a shortcut for the ten characters from codice_22 to codice_23. (This range syntax is the same as the syntax used by regular expressions.) The nonterminal symbols are the ones that expand to other rules: &quot;Value&quot;, &quot;Power&quot;, &quot;Product&quot;, &quot;Sum&quot;, and &quot;Expr&quot;. Note that rules &quot;Sum&quot; and &quot;Product&quot; don&#x27;t lead to desired left-associativity of these operations (they don&#x27;t deal with associativity at all, and it has to be handled in post-processing step after parsing), and the &quot;Power&quot; rule (by referring to itself on the right) results in desired right-associativity of exponent. Also note that a rule like (with intention to achieve left-associativity) would cause infinite recursion, so it cannot be used in practice even though it can be expressed in the grammar.

=== Semantics ===

The fundamental difference between context-free grammars and parsing expression grammars is that the PEG&#x27;s choice operator is &quot;ordered&quot;. If the first alternative succeeds, the second alternative is ignored. Thus ordered choice is not commutative, unlike unordered choice as in context-free grammars. Ordered choice is analogous to soft cut operators available in some logic programming languages.

The consequence is that if a CFG is transliterated directly to a PEG, any ambiguity in the former is resolved by deterministically picking one parse tree from the possible parses. By carefully choosing the order in which the grammar alternatives are specified, a programmer has a great deal of control over which parse tree is selected.

Parsing expression grammars also add the and- and not- syntactic predicates. Because they can use an arbitrarily complex sub-expression to &quot;look ahead&quot; into the input string without actually consuming it, they provide a powerful syntactic lookahead and disambiguation facility, in particular when reordering the alternatives cannot specify the exact parse tree desired.

=== Operational interpretation of parsing expressions ===
Each nonterminal in a parsing expression grammar essentially represents a parsing function in a recursive descent parser, and the corresponding parsing expression represents the &quot;code&quot; comprising the function. Each parsing function conceptually takes an input string as its argument, and yields one of the following results:
* &quot;success&quot;, in which the function may optionally move forward or &quot;consume&quot; one or more characters of the input string supplied to it, or
* &quot;failure&quot;, in which case no input is consumed.

An atomic parsing expression consisting of a single terminal (i.e. literal) succeeds if the first character of the input string matches that terminal, and in that case consumes the input character; otherwise the expression yields a failure result. An atomic parsing expression consisting of the empty string always trivially succeeds without consuming any input.
An atomic parsing expression consisting of a nonterminal &quot;A&quot; represents a recursive call to the nonterminal-function &quot;A&quot;. A nonterminal may succeed without actually consuming any input, and this is considered an outcome distinct from failure.

The sequence operator &quot;e&quot;1 &quot;e&quot;2 first invokes &quot;e&quot;1, and if &quot;e&quot;1 succeeds, subsequently invokes &quot;e&quot;2 on the remainder of the input string left unconsumed by &quot;e&quot;1, and returns the result. If either &quot;e&quot;1 or &quot;e&quot;2 fails, then the sequence expression &quot;e&quot;1 &quot;e&quot;2 fails (consuming no input).

The choice operator &quot;e&quot;1 / &quot;e&quot;2 first invokes &quot;e&quot;1, and if &quot;e&quot;1 succeeds, returns its result immediately. Otherwise, if &quot;e&quot;1 fails, then the choice operator backtracks to the original input position at which it invoked &quot;e&quot;1, but then calls &quot;e&quot;2 instead, returning &quot;e&quot;2&#x27;s result.

The zero-or-more, one-or-more, and optional operators consume zero or more, one or more, or zero or one consecutive repetitions of their sub-expression &quot;e&quot;, respectively. Unlike in context-free grammars and regular expressions, however, these operators &quot;always&quot; behave greedily, consuming as much input as possible and never backtracking. (Regular expression matchers may start by matching greedily, but will then backtrack and try shorter matches if they fail to match.) For example, the expression a* will always consume as many a&#x27;s as are consecutively available in the input string, and the expression (a* a) will always fail because the first part (a*) will never leave any a&#x27;s for the second part to match.

The and-predicate expression &amp;&quot;e&quot; invokes the sub-expression &quot;e&quot;, and then succeeds if &quot;e&quot; succeeds and fails if &quot;e&quot; fails, but in either case &quot;never consumes any input&quot;.

The not-predicate expression !&quot;e&quot; succeeds if &quot;e&quot; fails and fails if &quot;e&quot; succeeds, again consuming no input in either case.

=== More examples ===
The following recursive rule matches standard C-style if/then/else statements in such a way that the optional &quot;else&quot; clause always binds to the innermost &quot;if&quot;, because of the implicit prioritization of the &#x27;/&#x27; operator. (In a context-free grammar, this construct yields the classic dangling else ambiguity.)

S ← &#x27;if&#x27; C &#x27;then&#x27; S &#x27;else&#x27; S / &#x27;if&#x27; C &#x27;then&#x27; S
The following recursive rule matches Pascal-style nested comment syntax, . Recall that matches any single character.

C ← Begin N* End
Begin ← &#x27;(*&#x27;
End ← &#x27;*)&#x27;
N ← C / (!Begin !End .)
The parsing expression matches and consumes the text &quot;foo&quot; but only if it is followed by the text &quot;bar&quot;. The parsing expression matches the text &quot;foo&quot; but only if it is &quot;not&quot; followed by the text &quot;bar&quot;. The expression matches a single &quot;a&quot; but only if it is not part of an arbitrarily long sequence of a&#x27;s followed by a b.

The parsing expression matches and consumes an arbitrary-length sequence of a&#x27;s and b&#x27;s. The production rule describes the simple context-free &quot;matching language&quot; formula_9.
The following parsing expression grammar describes the classic non-context-free language formula_10:

S ← &amp;(A &#x27;c&#x27;) &#x27;a&#x27;+ B !.
A ← &#x27;a&#x27; A? &#x27;b&#x27;
B ← &#x27;b&#x27; B? &#x27;c&#x27;
== Implementing parsers from parsing expression grammars ==
Any parsing expression grammar can be converted directly into a recursive descent parser. Due to the unlimited lookahead capability that the grammar formalism provides, however, the resulting parser could exhibit exponential time performance in the worst case.

It is possible to obtain better performance for any parsing expression grammar by converting its recursive descent parser into a &quot;packrat parser&quot;, which always runs in linear time, at the cost of substantially greater storage space requirements. A packrat parser
is a form of parser similar to a recursive descent parser in construction, except that during the parsing process it memoizes the intermediate results of all invocations of the mutually recursive parsing functions, ensuring that each parsing function is only invoked at most once at a given input position. Because of this memoization, a packrat parser has the ability to parse many context-free grammars and &quot;any&quot; parsing expression grammar (including some that do not represent context-free languages) in linear time. Examples of memoized recursive descent parsers are known from at least as early as 1993.
This analysis of the performance of a packrat parser assumes that enough memory is available to hold all of the memoized results; in practice, if there is not enough memory, some parsing functions might have to be invoked more than once at the same input position, and consequently the parser could take more than linear time.

It is also possible to build LL parsers and LR parsers from parsing expression grammars, with better worst-case performance than a recursive descent parser without memoization, but the unlimited lookahead capability of the grammar formalism is then lost. Therefore, not all languages that can be expressed using parsing expression grammars can be parsed by LL or LR parsers.

=== Bottom-up PEG parsing ===

A pika parser uses dynamic programming to apply PEG rules bottom-up and right to left, which is the inverse of the normal recursive descent order of top-down, left to right. Parsing in reverse order solves the left recursion problem, allowing left-recursive rules to be used directly in the grammar without being rewritten into non-left-recursive form, and also confers optimal error recovery capabilities upon the parser, which historically proved difficult to achieve for recursive descent parsers.

== Advantages ==
=== No compilation required ===
Many parsing algorithms require a preprocessing step where the grammar is first compiled into an opaque executable form, often some sort of automaton. Parsing expressions can be executed directly (even if it is typically still advisable to transform the human-readable PEGs shown in this article into a more native format, such as S-expressions, before evaluating them).

=== Compared to regular expressions ===
Compared to pure regular expressions (i.e., describing a language recognisable using a finite automaton), PEGs are vastly more powerful. In particular they can handle unbounded recursion, and so match parentheses down to an arbitrary nesting depth; regular expressions can at best keep track of nesting down to some fixed depth, because a finite automaton (having a finite set of internal states) can only distinguish finitely many different nesting depths. In more theoretical terms, formula_11 (the language of all strings of zero or more formula_12&#x27;s, followed by an &quot;equal number&quot; of formula_13s) is not a regular language, but it is easily seen to be a parsing expression language, matched by the grammar
start ← AB !.
AB ← (&#x27;a&#x27; AB &#x27;b&#x27;)?
Here codice_24 is the starting expression. The codice_5 part enforces that the input ends after the codice_26, by saying “there is no next character”; unlike regular expressions, which have magic constraints codice_27 or codice_28 for this, parsing expressions can express the end of input using only the basic primitives.

The codice_29, codice_30, and codice_31 of parsing expressions are similar to those in regular expressions, but a difference is that these operate strictly in a greedy mode. This is ultimately due to codice_32 being an ordered choice. A consequence is that something can match as a regular expression which does not match as parsing expression:
: codice_33
is both a valid regular expression and a valid parsing expression. As regular expression, it matches codice_34, but as parsing expression it does not match, because the codice_35 will match the codice_36, then codice_37 will match the codice_38, leaving nothing for the codice_39, so at that point matching the sequence fails. &quot;Trying again&quot; with having codice_35 match the empty string is explicitly against the semantics of parsing expressions; this is not an edge case of a particular matching algorithm, instead it is the sought behaviour.

Even regular expressions that depend on nondeterminism &quot;can&quot; be compiled into a parsing expression grammar, by having a separate nonterminal for every state of the corresponding DFA and encoding its transition function into the definitions of these nonterminals —

A ← &#x27;x&#x27; B / &#x27;y&#x27; C

is effectively saying &quot;from state A transition to state B if the next character is x, but to state C if the next character is y&quot; — but this works because nondeterminism can be eliminated within the realm of regular languages. It would not make use of the parsing expression variants of the repetition operations.

=== Compared to context-free grammars ===

PEGs can comfortably be given in terms of characters, whereas context-free grammars (CFGs) are usually given in terms of tokens, thus requiring an extra step of tokenisation in front of parsing proper. An advantage of not having a separate tokeniser is that different parts of the language (for example embedded mini-languages) can easily have different tokenisation rules.

In the strict formal sense, PEGs are likely incomparable to CFGs, but practically there are many things that PEGs can do which pure CFGs cannot, whereas it is difficult to come up with examples of the contrary. In particular PEGs can be crafted to natively resolve ambiguities, such as the &quot;dangling else&quot; problem in C, C++, and Java, whereas CFG-based parsing often needs a rule outside of the grammar to resolve them. Moreover any PEG can be parsed in linear time by using a packrat parser, as described above, whereas parsing according to a general CFG is asymptotically equivalent to boolean matrix multiplication (thus likely between quadratic and cubic time).

One classical example of a formal language which is provably not context-free is the language formula_14: an arbitrary number of formula_12s are followed by an equal number of formula_13s, which in turn are followed by an equal number of formula_17s. This, too, is a parsing expression language, matched by the grammar
start ← AB &#x27;c&#x27;*
AB ← &#x27;a&#x27; AB &#x27;b&#x27; / &amp;(BC !.)
BC ← (&#x27;b&#x27; BC &#x27;c&#x27;)?
For codice_26 to match, the first stretch of formula_12s must be followed by an equal number of formula_13s, and in addition codice_42 has to match where the formula_12s switch to formula_13s, which means those formula_13s are followed by an equal number of formula_17s.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Memory consumption ===
PEG parsing is typically carried out via &quot;packrat parsing&quot;, which uses memoization to eliminate redundant parsing steps. Packrat parsing requires internal storage proportional to the total input size, rather than to the depth of the parse tree as with LR parsers. Whether this is a significant difference depends on circumstances; if parsing is a service provided as a function then the parser will have stored the full parse tree up until returning it, and already that parse tree will typically be of size proportional to the total input size. If parsing is instead provided as a generator then one might get away with only keeping parts of the parse tree in memory, but the feasibility of this depends on the grammar. A parsing expression grammar can be designed so that only after consuming the full input will the parser discover that it needs to backtrack to the beginning, which again could require storage proportional to total input size.

For recursive grammars and some inputs, the depth of the parse tree can be proportional to the input size, so both an LR parser and a packrat parser will appear to have the same worst-case asymptotic performance. However in many domains, for example hand-written source code, the expression nesting depth has an effectively constant bound quite independent of the length of the program, because expressions nested beyond a certain depth tend to get refactored. When it is not necessary to keep the full parse tree, a more accurate analysis would take the depth of the parse tree into account separately from the input size.

=== Computational model ===
In order to attain linear overall complexity, the storage used for memoization must furthermore provide amortized constant time access to individual data items memoized. In practice that is no problem — for example a dynamically sized hash table attains this – but that makes use of pointer arithmetic, so it presumes having a random-access machine. Theoretical discussions of data structures and algorithms have an unspoken tendency to presume a more restricted model (possibly that of lambda calculus, possibly that of Scheme), where a sparse table rather has to be built using trees, and data item access is not constant time. Traditional parsing algorithms such as the LL parser are not affected by this, but it becomes a penalty for the reputation of packrat parsers: they rely on operations of seemingly ill repute.

Viewed the other way around, this says packrat parsers tap into computational power readily available in real life systems, that older parsing algorithms do not understand to employ.

=== Indirect left recursion ===

A PEG is called &quot;well-formed&quot; if it contains no &quot;left-recursive&quot; rules, i.e., rules that allow a nonterminal to expand to an expression in which the same nonterminal occurs as the leftmost symbol. For a left-to-right top-down parser, such rules cause infinite regress: parsing will continually expand the same nonterminal without moving forward in the string. Therefore, to allow packrat parsing, left recursion must be eliminated.

==== Practical significance ====
Direct recursion, be that left or right, is important in context-free grammars, because there recursion is the only way to describe repetition:

Sum → Term | Sum &#x27;+&#x27; Term | Sum &#x27;-&#x27; Term
Args → Arg | Arg &#x27;,&#x27; Args

People trained in using context-free grammars often come to PEGs expecting to use the same idioms, but parsing expressions can do repetition without recursion:

Sum ← Term ( &#x27;+&#x27; Term / &#x27;-&#x27; Term )*
Args ← Arg ( &#x27;,&#x27; Arg )*

A difference lies in the abstract syntax trees generated: with recursion each codice_43 or codice_44 can have at most two children, but with repetition there can be arbitrarily many. If later stages of processing require that such lists of children are recast as trees with bounded degree, for example microprocessor instructions for addition typically only allow two operands, then properties such as left-associativity would be imposed after the PEG-directed parsing stage.

Therefore left-recursion is practically less likely to trouble a PEG packrat parser than, say, an LL(k) context-free parser, unless one insists on using context-free idioms. However, not all cases of recursion are about repetition.

==== Non-repetition left-recursion ====

For example, in the arithmetic grammar above, it could seem tempting to express operator precedence as a matter of ordered choice — codice_45 would mean first try viewing as codice_43 (since we parse top–down), second try viewing as codice_47, and only third try viewing as codice_48 — rather than via nesting of definitions. This (non-well-formed) grammar seeks to keep precedence order only in one line:
Value ← [0-9.]+ / &#x27;(&#x27; Expr &#x27;)&#x27;
Product ← Expr ((&#x27;*&#x27; / &#x27;/&#x27;) Expr)+
Sum ← Expr ((&#x27;+&#x27; / &#x27;-&#x27;) Expr)+
Expr ← Sum / Product / Value
Unfortunately matching an codice_49 requires testing if a codice_43 matches, while matching a codice_43 requires testing if an codice_49 matches. Because the term appears in the leftmost position, these rules make up a circular definition that cannot be resolved. (Circular definitions that can be resolved exist—such as in the original formulation from the first example—but such definitions are required not to exhibit pathological recursion.) However, left-recursive rules can always be rewritten to eliminate left-recursion. For example, the following left-recursive CFG rule:

string-of-a ← string-of-a &#x27;a&#x27; | &#x27;a&#x27;
can be rewritten in a PEG using the plus operator:

string-of-a ← &#x27;a&#x27;+
The process of rewriting &quot;indirectly&quot; left-recursive rules is complex in some packrat parsers, especially when semantic actions are involved.

With some modification, traditional packrat parsing can support direct left recursion, but doing so results in a loss of the linear-time parsing property which is generally the justification for using PEGs and packrat parsing in the first place. Only the OMeta parsing algorithm supports full direct and indirect left recursion without additional attendant complexity (but again, at a loss of the linear time complexity), whereas all GLR parsers support left recursion.

== Unexpected behaviour ==
A common first impression of PEGs is that they look like CFGs with certain convenience features — repetition operators codice_53 as in regular expressions and lookahead predicates codice_54 — plus ordered choice for disambiguation. This understanding can be sufficient when one&#x27;s goal is to create a parser for a language, but it is not sufficient for more theoretical discussions of the computational power of parsing expressions. In particular the nondeterminism inherent in the unordered choice codice_55 of context-free grammars makes it very different from the deterministic ordered choice codice_32.

=== The midpoint problem ===

PEG packrat parsers cannot recognize some unambiguous nondeterministic CFG rules, such as the following:

S ← &#x27;x&#x27; S &#x27;x&#x27; | &#x27;x&#x27;

Neither LL(k) nor LR(k) parsing algorithms are capable of recognizing this example. However, this grammar can be used by a general CFG parser like the CYK algorithm. However, the &quot;language&quot; in question can be recognised by all these types of parser, since it is in fact a regular language (that of strings of an odd number of x&#x27;s).

It is instructive to work out exactly what a PEG parser does when attempting to match

S ← &#x27;x&#x27; S &#x27;x&#x27; / &#x27;x&#x27;

against the string codice_57. As expected, it recursively tries to match the nonterminal codice_58 at increasing positions in this string, until failing the match against the codice_59, and after that begins to backtrack. This goes as follows:
 Position: 123456
 String: xxxxxq
 Results: ↑ Pos.6: Neither branch of S matches
 ↑ Pos.5: First branch of S fails, second branch succeeds, yielding match of length 1.
 ↑ Pos.4: First branch of S fails, second branch succeeds, yielding match of length 1.
 ↑ Pos.3: First branch of S succeeds, yielding match of length 3.
 ↑ Pos.2: First branch of S fails, because after the S match at 3 comes a q.
 Second branch succeeds, yielding match of length 1.
 ↑ Pos.1: First branch of S succeeds, yielding match of length 3.
Matching against a parsing expression is greedy, in the sense that the first success encountered is the only one considered. Even if locally the choices are ordered longest first, there is no guarantee that this greedy matching will find the globally longest match.

=== Ambiguity detection and influence of rule order on language that is matched ===
LL(k) and LR(k) parser generators will fail to complete when the input grammar is ambiguous. This is a feature in the common case that the grammar is intended to be unambiguous but is defective. A PEG parser generator will resolve unintended ambiguities earliest-match-first, which may be arbitrary and lead to surprising parses.

The ordering of productions in a PEG grammar affects not only the resolution of ambiguity, but also the &quot;language matched&quot;. For example, consider the first PEG example in Ford&#x27;s paper
(example rewritten in pegjs.org/online notation, and labelled and ):
* :  

Ford notes that &quot;The second alternative in the latter PEG rule will never succeed because the first choice is always taken if the input string ... begins with &#x27;a&#x27;.&quot;. 
Specifically, (i.e., the language matched by ) includes the input &quot;ab&quot;, but does not. 
Thus, adding a new option to a PEG grammar can &quot;remove&quot; strings from the language matched, e.g. is the addition of a rule to the single-production grammar , which contains a string not matched by .
Furthermore, constructing a grammar to match from PEG grammars and is not always a trivial task.
This is in stark contrast to CFG&#x27;s, in which the addition of a new production cannot remove strings (though, it can introduce problems in the form of ambiguity),
and a (potentially ambiguous) grammar for can be constructed

S → start(G1) | start(G2)
== Theory of parsing expression grammars ==
It is an open problem to give a concrete example of a context-free language which cannot be recognized by a parsing expression grammar. In particular, it is open whether a parsing expression grammar can recognize the language of palindromes.

The class of parsing expression languages is closed under set intersection and complement, thus also under set union.

=== Undecidability of emptiness ===
In stark contrast to the case for context-free grammars, it is not possible to generate elements of a parsing expression language from its grammar. Indeed, it is algorithmically undecidable whether the language recognised by a parsing expression grammar is empty! One reason for this is that any instance of the Post correspondence problem reduces to an instance of the problem of deciding whether a parsing expression language is empty.

Recall that an instance of the Post correspondence problem consists of a list formula_24 of pairs of strings (of terminal symbols). The problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence formula_25 of indices in the range formula_26 such that formula_27. To reduce this to a parsing expression grammar, let formula_28 be arbitrary pairwise distinct equally long strings of terminal symbols (already with formula_29 distinct symbols in the terminal symbol alphabet, length formula_30 suffices) and consider the parsing expression grammar
formula_31
Any string matched by the nonterminal formula_32 has the form formula_33 for some indices formula_34. Likewise any string matched by the nonterminal formula_35 has the form formula_36. Thus any string matched by formula_37 will have the form formula_38 where formula_39.

== Practical use ==
* Python reference implementation CPython introduced a PEG parser in version 3.9 as an alternative to the LL(1) parser and uses just PEG from version 3.10.

* The jq programming language uses a formalism closely related to PEG.

* The Lua authors created LPeg, a pattern-matching library that uses PEG instead of regular expressions, as well as the re module which implements a regular-expression-like syntax utilizing the LPeg library.

<text>The Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act was a U.S. federal law that banned Internet taxes in the United States. Signed into law on December 3, 2004, by George W. Bush, it extended until 2007 the then-current moratorium on new and discriminatory taxes on the Internet. It also extended the federal prohibition against state and local Internet access taxes until November 2007. 
The law&#x27;s primary supporters were Representative Christopher Cox (R-California) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), as well as Senator George Allen (R-Virginia).

The law was supported by a congressionally sponsored study commission known as the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, which studied Internet taxes in 1999 and 2000. The Commission was chaired by then-Virginia Governor James S. Gilmore, III, who led a coalition of Commission members to issue a final report opposing taxation of the Internet and eliminating federal telephone taxes, among other ideas. 

On November 1, 2007, President Bush signed the &quot;Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendment Act of 2007&quot; into law. It extended the prohibitions against multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce until November 1, 2014. &quot;See&quot; 47 United States Code Section 151.

<text>Rad Racer, known as in Japan, is a racing video game developed and published by Square for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1987. In this game, players drive a Ferrari 328 or a generic Formula One racing machine through a racecourse. The game was released in North America and Europe months after its debut. The title became well known for being one of two titles from Square that made use of stereoscopic 3D, which was made possible by wearing a pair of anaglyph glasses. Square president Masafumi Miyamoto initially conceived the game as an opportunity for developer Nasir Gebelli to demonstrate his 3D programming skills. Gebelli developed, and often drew by hand, the graphics for the game&#x27;s 3D mode.

The game sold 1.96 million copies and is considered one of the best racing games on the NES, but was criticized as being derivative of other racing games from the period. Reviewers widely compared the game to &quot;Out Run&quot;, though opined that &quot;Rad Racer&quot; was different in some ways, and they praised the sense of speed. The game appeared in the 1989 film &quot;The Wizard&quot; and was one of three games to feature a unique competition course in the 1990 Nintendo World Championship.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Rad Racer&quot; is a racing game in which the player races in a &quot;Transamerica&quot; race from the West Coast to the East Coast. The gameplay is sprite-based, and the player controls the car from a &quot;behind the vehicle&quot; perspective. At the start of the game, the player chooses between two types of car to race, either a 328 Twin Turbo or an F1 Machine, though both cars perform exactly the same. The objective is to complete eight driving stages of varying skylines, environments, and locations, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Athens. Competitors&#x27; vehicles get faster as the stages progress and include Volkswagen Beetles to Ferrari Testarossas. The player&#x27;s car can accelerate to 100 km/h, which turbo can then be activated to accelerate to a maximum of 255 km/h. The player can brake, steer, and change the background music while driving. Hitting any obstacles or other cars may cause the player&#x27;s vehicle to flip and crash. Players have a limited amount of time to reach the next &quot;checkpoint&quot; in the course, which is indicated by a checkered flag; passing the flag adds additional time or may signal the end of the course. Players have a simulated dashboard that contains a progress bar, speedometer, tachometer, score, and time remaining. Unlike in &quot;Out Run&quot; where the game ends immediately, when time runs out, the player&#x27;s vehicle coasts and decelerates down to 0 km/h before the game ends, giving the player an extra five to ten seconds to possibly reach the next checkpoint.

Players can activate a 3D mode during play by pressing the &quot;Select&quot; button and wearing 3D glasses. Players could also use the Power Glove to control their vehicle. The game was also compatible with the Famicom 3D, an accessory to the original Famicom released in Japan that utilized LCD &quot;shutter glasses&quot; to simulate 3D.

==Development and release==
The root cause for the game&#x27;s development was the then-President of Square Masafumi Miyamoto wanting to implement newly hired programmer Nasir Gebelli&#x27;s skills with 3D programming previously used to develop games for the Apple II. &quot;Rad Racer&quot; was the second title by Square to use anaglyph-based 3D: Gebelli worked on both titles and was influenced by his work on the first 3D game titled &quot;The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner&quot;. Two game programmers had left Square as Gebelli was hired, resulting in Gebelli to begin programming the game by himself. Gebelli remained in Japan to figure out how to create realistic background movement of the game&#x27;s scenery while the rest of Square was on vacation in Hawaii.

Game developer Takashi Tokita worked on &quot;Rad Racer&quot; with Gebelli, alongside developer Hiromichi Tanaka and artist Kazuko Shibuya who had previously worked on &quot;The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner&quot; with Gebelli. Akitoshi Kawazu also contributed to the development as his first game under Square. Hironobu Sakaguchi and Akitoshi Kawazu both worked on &quot;Rad Racer&quot;, causing developer Koichi Ishii to plan for the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; by himself briefly.

Though Gebelli found the work challenging, he was able to simulate the moving road in what Tokita described as a &quot;tricky&quot; bit of programming. To make the roads look like they were turning in 3D on a typical television, most of which at the time used cathode-ray tubes, the developers integrated scrolling by individual scanlines. &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; used this method to create game effects for the enemy Odin. Since the game was not programmed to display single sprites but was drawn line by line, Gebelli came several times a week memorizing Shibuya&#x27;s instructions on how the courses should be drawn. Shibuya would point out how many pixels and what color the lines had to be to create roads to Gebelli. Square produced six different versions of &quot;Rad Racer&quot; for different regions to accommodate the different 3D viewing systems needed if players were using either a typical television or the Famicom 3D System and a different version required for the PAL region. At the time, programmers usually worked on games individually, which Tokita described having someone to work with as an asset. Tokita designed and wrote the program for the billboards that appear in the game. Tokita also made all four levels and during the process, he learned that the middle two levels shared assets, which saved time and memory. Shibuya worked on the character sprites in which Final Fantasy developer Koichi Ishii stated that the sprites of &quot;3-D Battles of WorldRunner&quot; and &quot;Rad Racer&quot; typify Kazuko Shibuya’s pixel art style. Akitoshi Kawazu’s designed the &quot;Rad Racer&quot; ending that indicated with dots how far the player&#x27;s progress.

&quot;Rad Racer&quot; was announced at CES in May 1987 as 3-D Racer and was released in Japan as &quot;Highway Star&quot; on August 7, 1987. In August 1987, Nintendo released an arcade machine called &quot;Playchoice-10&quot; that contained up to ten popular NES titles. Amongst the eligible NES games, &quot;Rad Racer&quot; was also available on the arcade machine. Finally, the game was later released for the NES as &quot;Rad Racer&quot; in October 1987 in North America and on January 15, 1988 in Europe.

==Reception==
&quot;Rad Racer&quot; was met with favorable reviews, enjoyed commercial success, and sold 1.96 million copies. It also ranked 8th on &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s player&#x27;s poll &quot;Top 30&quot;. &quot;Famitsu&quot; praised the sense of speed but felt the game was slightly monotonous. Japanese publication &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot; applauded the variety of game landscapes found in different levels. British magazine &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called it an &quot;extremely playable racing game&quot; and said &quot;things get very fast and competitive as you get further into the game.&quot;

Retrospective reviews gave the title a more mixed reception. Skyler Miller of &quot;GameSpot&quot;, in his article &quot;The History of Square&quot;, commented that the game bears more than a passing resemblance to &quot;Out Run&quot;,&quot; but went on to say that &quot;it&#x27;s more than just a clone&quot; and credited the game with &quot;effectively convey[ing] the proper sense of speed.&quot; He continued to criticize the 3D effect, stating it created some sense of depth to the gameplay but was hindered by a pronounced screen flickering. He concluded that the game does not require 3D features and that it stands on its own as a &quot;fine racing game&quot;. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; stated in his retrospective that the game&#x27;s simplicity and &quot;race or die&quot; focus make it one of the best racing games of its time. He also mentioned how the power glove does not improve player control, though felt the experience was still fun. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;’s Jeremy Peeples and Neil Foster praised the game&#x27;s sense of speed and arcade levels of difficulty, but criticized the lack of personality and faulty collision physics.

&quot;Rad Racer&quot; was ranked number 57 on &quot;IGN&quot;″s Top 100 Nintendo Entertainment System games and was called &quot;iconic&quot; and one of the NES&#x27;s premier racing games. &quot;Maxim&quot; included the game amongst thirteen others in their greatest 8-bit video games of all time list.

===Legacy===
Due to most of &quot;Rad Racer&quot; sales being from the United States, &quot;Rad Racer II&quot; was developed and released only in North America for the NES and the arcade. The sequel featured eight new tracks and new music but similar gameplay. &quot;Hardcore Gamer 101&quot; said that steering was looser than the first game and rival cars more aggressive, leading to a less enjoyable playing experience. Despite the efforts of Square to make unique games with 3D features such as &quot;Rad Racer&quot; and &quot;3-D Worldrunner&quot;, and high sales, the company was in financial trouble. These events are what led to a final attempt at a breakout hit, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. &quot;Rad Racer&quot; appeared in a scene in the movie &quot;The Wizard&quot;. It was also one of three games, including &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Tetris&quot;, featured at the 1990 Nintendo World Championship with an exclusive racing level to complete as one of the rounds of competition. The limited-edition release of the game&#x27;s cartridge used in the tournament is now one of the rarest and most valuable Nintendo games available.

<text>Kakabeka Falls () is a waterfall on the Kaministiquia River, located beside the village of Kakabeka Falls in the municipality of Oliver Paipoonge, Ontario, west of the city of Thunder Bay.

The falls have a drop of , cascading into a gorge carved out of the Precambrian Shield by meltwater following the last glacial maximum. Because of its size and ease of access, it has been consequently nicknamed &quot;the Niagara of the North&quot;.

The rock face of the falls and the escarpments along the gorge are composed primarily of unstable shale, and are eroding. These rocks host sensitive flora, and contain some of the oldest fossils in existence, some 1.6 billion years of age. Due to the fragile rock, going into the gorge below the falls is prohibited.

The name &quot;Kakabeka&quot; comes from the Ojibwe word &quot;gakaabikaa&quot; &quot;waterfall over a cliff&quot; (help]).

== Kakabeka Falls Provincial Park ==
Kakabeka Falls Provincial Park, established in 1955, covers and is managed by Ontario Parks. It surrounds the falls and extends along the Kaministiquia River, which was used centuries ago by voyageurs, who were the first Europeans to overwinter annually in northern Ontario. They used the Kaministiquia River as a major route to the northwest, with a mountain portage around the falls. A hotel with terrace which was once located on the edge of the gorge was removed after the park&#x27;s creation. It included a round restaurant that once overlooked the falls, and in winter would get covered in a thick layer of ice from the spray of the falls.

The park has two campgrounds with 169 campsites, 90 of which have electricity. The park maintains of hiking on six trails, and offers cross-country ski trails in the winter. A small Natural Heritage Education program is operated within the park in the summer, and offers daily interpretive programs, guided hikes, and a visitor centre.

== Legend of Green Mantle ==
The Legend of Green Mantle is about an Ojibwe chief who upon hearing news of an imminent attack from the Sioux tribe instructs his daughter, Princess Green Mantle, to devise a plan to protect her people. She enters the Sioux camp along the Kaministiquia River and, pretending to be lost, she bargains with them to spare her life if she will bring them to her father&#x27;s camp. Placed at the head of the canoe, she instead leads herself and the Sioux warriors over the falls to their deaths, sparing her tribe from the attack. The legend claims that one can see Green Mantle when looking into the mist of Kakabeka Falls, a monument to the princess that gave her life to save her people. Other versions of the legend say she came across the Sioux herself, and later jumped out of the canoe ahead of the falls and swam to shore, leaving the Sioux to go over the falls, then ran back to the camp to warn her people.

== Kakabeka Falls in art ==

The most famous painting featuring the falls, painted by Lucius Richard O&#x27;Brien in 1882, is held by the National Gallery of Canada.

Frances Anne Hopkins, whose historic paintings are well known for her portrayal of Canadian life, painted the portage around the falls in 1877. Her painting, &quot;The Red River Expedition at Kakabeka Falls, Ontario&quot;, depicts the Red River Expedition of 1870 portaging around the falls on its way to the Red River Colony to interdict Louis Riel. Edward Roper also painted them. His &quot;Portage Below Kakabeka Falls, Kaministiquia River, Lake Superior&quot; (Peter Winkworth Collection of Canadiana. Library and Archives Canada, e000996335) is dated 1878.

<doc id="892918" wikidata="Q4284257" url="?curid=892918" title="Cincinnati riots of 2001">
<text>The 2001 Cincinnati riots were a series of civil disorders which took place in and around the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio from April 9 to 13, 2001. They began with a peaceful protest in the heart of the city on Fountain Square over the inadequate police response to the police shooting of unarmed African American 19-year-old Timothy Thomas. The peaceful protest soon turned into a march that went in the direction of the victim&#x27;s home neighborhood of Over-the-Rhine. 

The period of unrest was sparked after 19-year-old Timothy Thomas, an unarmed African American man, was shot and killed by Cincinnati Police Department Patrolman Stephen Roach during an attempt to arrest him for non-violent misdemeanors, most of which were traffic citations. Tensions were already high in the city following a series of other incidents involving police brutality and racial profiling, including thirteen deaths. Protests erupted into four nights of unrest, with instances of recorded property destruction in Cincinnati, objects thrown at police officers by demonstrators, and vandalism and looting of businesses before a city-imposed curfew eventually ended the unrest.

It was ultimately determined that the period of unrest caused $3.6 million in damage to businesses and another $1.5 to $2 million to the city. A subsequent community boycott of downtown businesses had an estimated adverse impact of $10 million on the area. Incidents of violent crime rose in the downtown area for several years thereafter. The city worked with the community and police to improve training and policies to prevent incidents like that in which Thomas was killed.

== Background ==
The initial incident and much of the subsequent unrest began on Fountain Square in Downtown Cincinnati. Much of the subsequent unrest took place in Over-the-Rhine, the neighborhood of the victim immediately north of Cincinnati&#x27;s central business district. A 2000 demographic profile of the neighborhood showed a resident population of 7,368, of whom 5,974 were African American. The profile also showed significant poverty, unemployment, and a lack of development in the area for several decades. Some 1,667 of 3,594 housing units, or more than one third, in the neighborhood were vacant. About 96 percent of the occupied houses were renter-occupied. The neighborhood had a concentration of African Americans, who otherwise made up 40 percent overall of the 331,000 residents of the city. At the time of the protests and growing unrest, the median income in Over-the-Rhine was $8,600 compared to $26,774 for the city overall. Author David Waddington attributed the poverty of the area to high unemployment resulting from a loss of manufacturing jobs in the city, as well as cuts in youth programs in the city. The neighborhood had a high rate of crimes, in particular drug-related offenses.

The array of poverty-associated problems resulted in heightened tensions between African-American residents in the neighborhood and the Cincinnati Police Department. Between 1995 and April 2001, fifteen black males suspected of crimes had been killed by Cincinnati police during confrontation or while in custody, including four since November 2000, while no white suspects were killed in that period. 

In particular, two recent deaths had sparked tensions: Roger Owensby, Jr. died November 7, 2000, allegedly of asphyxiation from a chokehold from a police officer, and Jeffrey Irons died the next day in a scuffle with police. One of the officers was acquitted, while the other case ended in a mistrial and the officer was not re-tried. 

This string of deaths led to claims by the community that the police were acting discriminatorily.
Three weeks before the protests and growing unrest, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a group of local organizations filed a civil lawsuit against the police department and city, alleging 30 years of racial profiling. A number of other civil suits were initiated against the department, including one African-American man who alleged he was handcuffed and beaten during a traffic stop. Bomani Tyehimba filed a lawsuit in 1999 against the city of Cincinnati. He claimed that during a routine traffic stop, police illegally ordered him out of his car, handcuffed him and held a gun to his head.

A local independent newspaper, &quot;CityBeat&quot;, published research that an &quot;analysis of 141,000 traffic citations written by Cincinnati Police in a 22-month period found black drivers twice as likely as whites to be cited for driving without a license, twice as likely to be cited for not wearing a seat belt and four times as likely to be cited for driving without proof of insurance.&quot; The NAACP argued that such statistics were the result of police targeting &quot;driving while black,&quot; rather than actual differences in the rate of offenses committed by different groups.

== Incident ==
In little more than two months preceding this incident, Timothy Thomas had received numerous traffic citations: he &quot;was pulled over 11 times by six different white officers and four black officers. They cited Thomas for 21 violations, almost all of them for exactly the same things – not wearing a seat belt or driving without a license.&quot;

In the early morning hours of April 7, 2001, Cincinnati police in Over-the-Rhine attempted to arrest the 19-year-old, who was wanted on 14 nonviolent misdemeanor counts, of which 12 were traffic citations.
Thomas was pursued for 10 minutes by nine officers, who were later joined by Patrolman Stephen Roach. The pursuit culminated at 2:20 a.m. when Thomas rounded a corner in a dark alley and surprised Roach, who shot him in the chest at close range. Roach said he believed Thomas was reaching for a gun in his waistband, but investigation later determined Thomas was trying to pull up his &quot;baggy pants.&quot; Roach also said that he was not aware that charges against Thomas were non-violent, and that Thomas ignored an order to stop. Thomas was rushed to a hospital, but died of his wounds.

== Disturbance ==
The shooting of Thomas sparked widespread outrage in the city, especially in Over-the-Rhine. On April 9, a group of 200 protesters brandishing signs, including Thomas&#x27; mother, Angela Leisure, gathered outside Cincinnati City Hall while the city council was in session, to demand public explanation for Thomas&#x27; shooting. The protesters also demanded to know the results of the police investigation of the shooting, but were told the department was not ready and was still investigating. The council members stayed inside city hall for three hours and did not respond to the crowd&#x27;s demands. 

Later that evening, several hundred residents gathered outside the Cincinnati Police District 1 headquarters in Over-the-Rhine and confronted a line of police officers on horseback and in police cruisers. For about an hour, the crowd threw stones and bottles at police, smashed the station&#x27;s front door, pulled the station flag from its mast and re-hung it upside down. Police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, bean bags and rubber bullets. Ten arrests were made during the incident.
On the afternoon of April 10, the unrest resumed after a static protest on Fountain Square. Approximately 20 to 30 African-Americans moved through city streets towards Over the Rhine, soon followed by police officers. At two road intersections, the crowd began throwing bottles and garbage at police, who retreated both times. Parts of the crowd headed back downtown, where they began to overturn garbage cans, vendor carts, and newspaper boxes. The crowd began smashing windows of businesses and looting stores. Police moved in on horseback or with linked arms and dispersed the crowd with bean bags, tear gas and rubber bullets. They made sixty-six arrests of protesters over the course of the day. The city called in deputies from the Hamilton County Sheriff&#x27;s Office to help when looting and vandalism broke out in other poorer neighborhoods in Cincinnati, including Walnut Hills and Avondale, where vandals broke windows and set small fires. Several gunshots were fired during the night, and there were a number of injuries reported in the incidents. Participants in the period of unrest dispersed in the early morning hours.

Many of the damaged downtown businesses resumed normal operations the next day. But, at nightfall on April 11, another interval of unrest broke out downtown as nothing had yet been done in retribution for the killing of Timothy Thomas, and more businesses were damaged and looted. Sporadic incidents continued the next evening, and a police crackdown resulted in another 82 arrests. By April 12, many downtown businesses did not open, and workers for many others refused to go downtown. A third night of unrest continued that evening, causing further damage.

The morning of April 13, Cincinnati Mayor Charles J. Luken announced a citywide curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. for all but work travelers. He also declared a state of emergency and brought in 125 Ohio Highway Patrol troopers to assist with policing. In all, 800 people were arrested for violating curfew conditions. This curfew did not extend to the city&#x27;s suburbs, prompting some criticism from Cincinnati residents of uneven enforcement of the curfew.

April 14 was the day of Timothy Thomas&#x27; funeral. Police kept a helicopter airborne and stationed police two blocks from the service. About 2,000 protesters began a peaceful march downtown following the service. A procession of 30 from the funeral marched to the intersection of Elm and Liberty streets. A group of seven law enforcement personnel arrived in patrol cruisers and fired bean bag ammunition into a crowd of 20, injuring four, including two children. Police contended they were acting under orders to disperse a large crowd blocking the intersection, while witnesses claimed the police did not provide warning and singled out black members of the group.

== Aftermath ==
The total damage sustained from the period of protest and unrest amounted to $3.6 million. In all, the city said 120 businesses experienced damage due to the civil unrest. It cost the city another $1.5 million to $2 million for emergency responders and equipment damage. The four days of protest and unrest are considered the largest urban disturbance in the United States since the 1992 Los Angeles period of unrest. There has been extensive discussion within the local community about the effects of suburbanization and urban decay in the city, as well as the redevelopment of Over-the-Rhine, a historic neighborhood. The incidents again strained the relationship between the police and residents of the city&#x27;s minority communities. In 2002, the city signed an agreement for initiatives to improve police service to minority communities, revise use-of-force guidelines and form a committee for community policing initiatives.

CPD officers began an unofficial work slowdown, which coincided with a rise in violent crime in the downtown area. In 2001 and 2002, violent crime and property crime rates rose in the city, with property crime rates peaking in 2003 before declining through 2010. The city has a crime rate higher than the national average but similar to other major cities. Initiatives were subsequently begun by community groups to reduce violence.

Sixty-three participants of the protest involved with property destruction and/or violence were indicted on felony charges.

Roach was tried for negligent homicide in September 2001. Cincinnati police attempted to waive the trial in favor of a bench ruling. Roach, who left the force to join a suburban police department, was later acquitted of the charges. Several isolated incidents of civil unrest occurred after his verdict was announced. An internal police investigation found Roach had lied in his incident report, had not followed department firearm procedures, and had not given Thomas sufficient time to respond to his order.

Angered by police reaction, particularly the April 14 incident, several community groups organized a boycott of downtown businesses. Several prominent African-American entertainers scheduled to perform in the city, including Bill Cosby, Whoopi Goldberg, and Smokey Robinson cancelled their performances there. After a year, the community boycott was estimated to have caused a $10 million negative economic impact on the city.

Significant gentrification of the Over the Rhine community began just before and continued after the period of civil unrest, as developers found property values low enough to allow acquisition and redevelopment. A number of tech companies and nightlife spots have opened in the neighborhood. By 2007, several new community events had been organized. Several large Cincinnati companies, including Fifth Third Bank, Procter &amp; Gamble and Kroger, announced support for reforms in the city, such as investment in schools and minority-hiring programs.

Police behavior and protocols were investigated, and changes were made to improve training and interaction with the community. On the ten-year anniversary of the protests and civil unrest, &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; reported that &quot;[t]he riots neither initiated the racial tension nor the police reforms, but accelerated both.&quot; Among the reforms were the following:

* Training officers to deal with &quot;low-light situations&quot; (such as the alley where Timothy Thomas was fatally shot).
* Training officers how to recognize suspects&#x27; potential mental health issues and how to interact with mentally ill people.
* Cincinnati patrol cars were equipped with computers to give police officers access to complete and detailed criminal records.
* Changes in the department&#x27;s &quot;foot pursuit policy,&quot; requiring officers to &quot;assess whether a pursuit is appropriate, taking into consideration the seriousness of the offense, whether the suspect is armed and their ability to apprehend at a later date.&quot;
* Requiring officers to complete &quot;contact cards&quot; after traffic stops, noting details about the car&#x27;s driver and passengers, including race. This change arose from complaints of racial profiling in traffic stops.
* The Citizens Complaint Authority was created in 2002 to independently review all &quot;serious uses of force&quot; by police officers.
* In late 2003 the city &#x27;updated Tasers for all officers after the death of Nathaniel Jones, an African-American man with drugs in his system.&quot; Jones died after officers &quot;hit him repeatedly with their batons.&quot;

<text>James Edward Ryan (February 11, 1863 – October 29, 1923), nicknamed &quot;Pony&quot;, was an American center fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played between 1885 and 1903, primarily for the Chicago White Stockings / Colts / Orphans. He batted .300 eleven times, retiring with a career average of .308, and was the seventh player to hit 100 career home runs. Ryan set major league records for career games (1,945) and assists (375) as an outfielder that were later broken by Jesse Burkett and Tris Speaker respectively. He also ended his career ranking second in putouts (3,701) and fourth in double plays (71).

==Baseball career==
A native of Clinton, Massachusetts, Ryan started his major league career with Chicago of the National League (NL) in 1885. He played for the team until 1900, except for the 1890 season when he played for the Chicago Pirates of the Players&#x27; League.

Ryan had his best season in 1888, leading the NL in hits (182), doubles (33), home runs (16), total bases (283), and slugging percentage (.515). He was also second in batting average (.332), extra-base hits (59) and runs scored (115). During that season, Ryan hit for the cycle on July 28. He also appeared in that game as a pitcher, becoming the first player in major league history to hit for the cycle and pitch in the same game. The White Stockings beat the Detroit Wolverines, 21–17.

Ryan was the most severely injured player when the Chicago team was involved in a train wreck at Lindsey, Ohio on August 6, 1893 when their sleeper cars derailed and crashed into a freight train that was stopped on a siding, resulting in three fatalities. Ryan&#x27;s legs were shattered, and for weeks there were doubts that he would even be able to walk again, resulting in a $10,000 settlement from the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. As late as the following January, it was still considered unlikely that he would be able to resume his career, but he returned to post a career-high .357 batting average. Almost exactly one year after the wreck, on August 5, 1894, Ryan and teammate Walt Wilmot were credited with saving hundreds of lives when a fire broke out in the stands at West Side Park; the two players used bats to break down barbed-wire fencing, allowing fans to escape onto the field.

In 1900, Ryan broke Tom Brown&#x27;s career record of 348 assists by an outfielder. Ryan finished his career with 375 assists. He held the record until Tris Speaker broke it in 1924. Ryan ended his major league career with the Washington Senators of the American League in 1902–1903. 

==Career statistics==
He was a career .308 hitter with 118 home runs and 1,093 runs batted in in 2,014 games. As a pitcher, he compiled a 6–1 record with a 3.62 earned run average and 43 strikeouts in 117 innings pitched. Ryan is 36th in runs scored, with him being 7th among 19th century players; the six ahead of him are each in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Player profile==
On the tough side, Ryan was one of the few players to punch a reporter at least twice. After his first episode, in 1887, Charlie Seymour of the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;Ryan slugged the magnificent Chicago reporter in Pittsburg[h] the other day.&quot; In the other, in 1892, he took exception to George Beachel of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. In the clubhouse after a game, Ryan &quot;picked a quarrel with [Beachel], and then attacked him, using him up pretty badly. No arrests have been made.&quot; In 1896, he punched a train conductor after losing his place and his teammates had gone to bed. A conductor who intervened was &quot;called down by Mr. Ryan, who got in one upper cut before [his longtime-captain manager Cap] Anson stopped the fun,&quot; wrote Tim Murnane of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;. 

In the 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, writer Bill James ranked Ryan as the 26th greatest center fielder of all time. 

==Personal life and death==
Ryan died in Chicago at age 60. He was married twice and left no children. He was buried in an unmarked grave until 2022 until the help of the SABR Grave Marker Project helped efforts to lend a proper gravestone.

<text>Royal Air Force Dishforth or more simply RAF Dishforth is a former Royal Air Force station near Thirsk in North Yorkshire, England. Opened in 1936, the base was used as a bomber airfield during the Second World War with both British and Canadian squadrons flying missions from the airfield. After the war, the base was used by various squadrons and training units before being disposed of in 1992 and handed over to the Army Air Corps.

==History==
The site at Dishforth was elected during the expansion period of the Royal Air Force in the 1930s. Named after the village of Dishforth, just to the north of the main runway, the base was opened in September 1936. Just like RAF Leeming further north, the airfield was adjacent to the Great North Road (now the A1(M)), and even extended over the road for some of its dispersal areas in the late 1930s. Five C-type hangars were built at the south-east boundary of the airfield, with the technical areas beyond the hangars. The creation of hardstanding hangarage, and brick-built accommodation blocks and messes, made Dishforth a preferred posting over the wartime built airbases which operated mainly from Nissen huts (such as Dalton, Tholthorpe, and Wombleton).

The first squadrons to arrive were No. 10 Sqn in January 1937, who immediately transferred from Handley Page Heyford aircraft to Armstrong Whitworth Whitley Mk 1 aircraft, and in February, No. 78 Sqn arrived, also with Heyfords, and were re-equipped with Whitleys in July of that same year. It was the dispersals across the A1 road that the Whitleys of No. 78 Sqn were stored, with barriers having to be placed across the carriageway to allow the aircraft to move back and forth.

When the Second World War started, No. 10 Sqn were engaged in leaflet dropping over Europe (known as &quot;Nickel&quot; raids, or &quot;Nickelling&quot;), whilst No. 78 Sqn in the pre-war period had been used to assimilate new crews fresh from training. At this time, the base was under the command of No. 4 Group, and whilst some bombing raids did take place, the squadrons were mostly engaged in leaflet dropping, including one raid over Berlin which was a round trip. In December 1939, No. 78 Squadron were sent to Linton-on-Ouse, and No. 51 Sqn moved in from Linton. Both No. 10 and No. 78 Sqns were used on bombing raids in the early part of 1940 with sorties over Norway and over the Ruhr.

In July 1940, No. 10 Sqn were transferred to RAF Leeming when it was opened, with an administrative detachment from No. 78 Sqn sent to Leeming as well to get the base up and running. Dishforth was used by several squadrons from RAF Leeming during early 1941 for &#x27;&quot;bombing-up purposes&quot;, as the airfield at Leeming was in the process of being concreted. Later in 1940, No. 78 Sqn returned from Leeming, with No. 10 Sqn being posted out of Dishforth for Leeming, leaving No. 51 and No. 78 Sqns at Dishforth. 

In February 1941, Whitleys from both squadrons took part in Operation Colossus, a commando raid on aqueducts in southern Italy. The RAF at that time did not have any suitable aircraft to transport troops over such a long-distance, however, the range of the Whitleys, and their ventral (side) gun turret, which was easily adapted into a jumping position for troops, made it ideal for the task. No. 12 (Blind Approach Training) Flight (later to become No. 1512 (Beam Approach Training) Flight) was formed at Dishforth in September 1941, flying Airspeed Oxfords. 

In April 1941, No. 78 Sqn was posted to RAF Middleton St George, leaving No. 51 Sqn as the only occupant. In the almost three-year tour that 51 Sqn performed at Dishforth, they flew 1,806 sorties, and lost 50 aircraft (an attrition rate of 2.8%). In early 1942, the Whitleys of 51 Sqn took part in raid on a radar installation in Bruneval, and in Operation Chariot, the raid on St. Nazaire. In June 1942, the first of the Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons, No. 425 (Alouette), was formed with Vickers Wellington aircraft. The squadron set about training and carried out their first raid on the night of the 5 and 6 October. In the same month as No. 425 were undertaking their first operational missions, No. 426 (Thunderbird) Squadron was formed up at Dishforth, becoming operational in January 1943.

In January 1943, Dishforth, along with ten other RAF airfields, was handed over from the RAF to the Royal Canadian Air Force (No. 4 Group RAF to No. 6 Group RCAF. Operations were concentrated at Leeming, Linton-on-Ouse and Middleton St George, with substations and the training bases being Topcliffe, Wombleton, Dalton and Dishforth, which had No. 1664 Heavy Conversion Unit. Both Canadian squadrons moved out of Dishforth in 1943; 425 in May and 426 in June respectively, which allowed for the runway to be upgraded. The RCAF kept Dishforth as the training arm for its bomber squadrons and when the upgrade was complete in November 1943, No. 1664 HCU (Heavy Conversion Unit) was allocated to the base.

In November 1944, the base was transferred into No. 7 Group, which had a responsibility for all the HCU stations. With hostilities in Europe at an end, the base was transferred again to RAF Transport Command, and continued with its training role. In November 1945, No. 1332 (Transport) Heavy Conversion Unit arrived from RAF Riccall, taking over training for long-haul transport routes and taking the aircraft form the existing HCUs at Dishforth.

===Post war===
Dishforth continued in the training role for transport aircraft after the war, and in 1956, No. 215 Sqn reformed at Dishforth with Scottish Aviation Pioneer aircraft, later disbanding at Dishforth in September 1958 to become No. 230 Sqn. In 1954, the base was initially approved for use in the PGM-17 Thor missile programme, but it never became one of the operational stations. In early 1962, No. 242 OCU was moved to Thorney Island and the base was put under a &quot;care and maintenance&quot; programme. Various aircraft from Leeming and Linton-on-Ouse used the airfield as a Relief Landing Ground (RLG), and the buildings were converted for use by the local police forces.

In 1992, the base was handed over to the Army Air Corps as Dishforth Airfield.

==Badge and motto==
The station badge features a white pack horse representing the transport nature of the base (post World War II), the horse is modelled on the White Horse of Kilburn, a nearby geographical feature in the Hambleton Hills. The station motto was &quot;Par Oneri&quot; ().

==Incidents==
* 13 September 1955—Hastings &quot;TG584&quot; lost control attempting to overshoot at RAF Dishforth and crashed; five died.

<text>Shyam Benegal (14 December 1934 – 23 December 2024) was an Indian film director, screenwriter and documentary filmmaker. Often regarded as the pioneer of parallel cinema, he is widely considered as one of the greatest filmmakers post 1970s. He has received several accolades, including eighteen National Film Awards, a Filmfare Award and a Nandi Award. In 2005, he was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India&#x27;s highest award in the field of cinema. In 1976, he was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian honour of the country, and in 1991, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian honour for his contributions in the field of arts. He died on 23 December 2024, aged 90, at Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai, where he was receiving treatment for chronic kidney disease.

Benegal was born in Hyderabad to Sridhar B. Benegal who was prominent in the field of photography. Starting his career as a copywriter, he made his first Documentary film in Gujarati, &quot;Gher Betha Ganga&quot; (Ganges at the Doorstep) in 1962. Benegal&#x27;s first four feature films – &quot;Ankur&quot; (1973), &quot;Nishant&quot; (1975), &quot;Manthan&quot; (1976) and &quot;&quot; (1977) – made him a pioneer of the new wave film movement of that period. Benegal&#x27;s &quot;Muslim Women Trilogy&quot; films &quot;Mammo&quot; (1994), &quot;Sardari Begum&quot; (1996), and &quot;Zubeidaa&quot; (2001) all won National Film Awards for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Benegal has won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi seven times. He was awarded the V. Shantaram Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Shyam Benegal was born on 14 December 1934 in a Konkani-speaking Hindu family in Hyderabad, as Shyam Sunder Benegal. His father hailed from Karnataka. When he was twelve years old, he made his first film, on a camera given to him by his photographer father Sridhar B. Benegal. He received an M.A. in Economics from Osmania University, Hyderabad. There he established the Hyderabad Film Society.

Film director and actor Guru Dutt&#x27;s maternal grandmother and Shyam&#x27;s paternal grandmother were sisters, thus making Dutt and Shyam second cousins.

Shyam Benegal married Nira Benegal. They have a daughter, Pia Benegal, a costume designer.

Shyam&#x27;s brother, Som, died in 2014, and his nephews, Dev and Rahul, have also pursued careers in filmmaking.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1959, he started working as a copywriter at a Mumbai-based advertising agency, Lintas Advertising, where he steadily rose to become the creative head. Meanwhile, Benegal made his first documentary in Gujarati, &quot;Gher Betha Ganga&quot; (Ganges at the Doorstep) in 1962. His first feature film had to wait another decade while he worked on the script.

In 1963 he had a brief stint with another advertising agency called ASP (Advertising, Sales and Promotion). During his advertising years, he directed over 900 sponsored documentaries and advertising films.

Between 1966 and 1973, Shyam taught at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune, and twice served as the institute&#x27;s chairman: 1980–83 and 1989–92. By this time he had already started making documentaries. One of his early documentaries &quot;A Child of the Streets&quot; (1967), garnered him wide acclaim. In all, he has made over 70 documentary and short films.

He was awarded the Homi J. Bhabha Fellowship (1970–72) which allowed him to work at the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, New York, and later at Boston&#x27;s WGBH-TV.

===Feature films===
After returning to Mumbai, he received independent financing and &quot;Ankur&quot; (&quot;The Seedling&quot;) was finally made in 1973. It was a realistic drama of economic and sexual exploitation in his home state, Telangana, and Benegal instantly shot to fame. The film introduced actors Shabana Azmi and Anant Nag and Benegal won the 1975 National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film. Shabana won the National Film Award for Best Actress.

The success that New India Cinema enjoyed in the 1970s and early 1980s could largely be attributed to Shyam Benegal&#x27;s quartet: &quot;Ankur&quot; (1973), &quot;Nishant&quot; (1975), &quot;Manthan&quot; (1976) and &quot;Bhumika&quot; (1977). Benegal used a variety of new actors, mainly from the FTII and NSD, such as Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, Smita Patil, Shabana Azmi, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Amrish Puri.

In Benegal&#x27;s next film, &quot;Nishant&quot; (&quot;Night&#x27;s End&quot;) (1975), a teacher&#x27;s wife is abducted and gang-raped by four zamindars; officialdom turns a deaf ear to the distraught husband&#x27;s pleas for help. &quot;Manthan&quot; (&quot;The Churning&quot;) (1976) is a film on rural empowerment and is set against the backdrop of Gujarat&#x27;s fledgling dairy industry. For the first time, over five lakh (half a million) rural farmers in Gujarat contributed 2 each and thus became the film&#x27;s producers. Upon its release, truckloads of farmers came to see &quot;their&quot; film, making it a success at the box office. After this trilogy on rural oppression, Benegal made a biopic &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Role&quot;) (1977), broadly based on the life of well-known Marathi stage and film actress of the 1940s, Hansa Wadkar (played by Smita Patil), who led a flamboyant and unconventional life. The main character sets out on an individual search for identity and self-fulfilment, while also grappling with exploitation by men.

In the early 1970s, Shyam made 21 film modules for Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE), sponsored by UNICEF. This allowed him to interact with children of SITE and many folk artists. Eventually he used many of these children in his feature length rendition of the classic folk tale &quot;Charandas Chor&quot; (&quot;Charandas the Thief&quot;) in 1975. He made it for the Children&#x27;s Film Society, India.
To quote film critic Derek Malcolm:

what Benegal has done is to paint a magnificent visual recreation of those extraordinary days and one that is also sensitive to the agonies and predicament of a talented woman whose need for security was only matched by her insistence on freedom.

===The 1980s===
Unlike most New Cinema filmmakers, Benegal has had private backers for many of his films and institutional backing for a few, including &quot;Manthan&quot; (Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation ) and &quot;Susman&quot; (1987) (Handloom Co-operatives). However, his films did not have proper releases. He turned to TV where he directed serials such as &quot;Yatra&quot; (1986), for the Indian Railways, and one of the biggest projects undertaken on Indian television, the 53-episode television serial &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot; (1988) based on Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s book, &quot;Discovery of India&quot;. This gave him an added advantage, as he managed to survive the collapse of the New Cinema movement in the late 1980s due to paucity of funding, with which were lost many neo-realist filmmakers. Benegal continued making films throughout the next two decades. He also served as the Director of the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) from 1980 to 1986.

Following the success of these four films, Benegal was backed by star Shashi Kapoor, for whom he made &quot;Junoon&quot; (1978) and &quot;Kalyug&quot; (1981). The former was an interracial love story set amidst the turbulent period of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, while the latter was based on the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and was not a big hit, although both won Filmfare Best Movie Awards in 1980 and 1982, respectively.

Benegal&#x27;s next film &quot;Mandi&quot; (1983), was a satirical comedy about politics and prostitution, starring Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil. Later, working from his own story, based on the last days of Portuguese in Goa, in the early 1960s, Shyam explored human relationships in &quot;Trikal&quot; (1985).

Soon, Shyam Benegal stepped beyond traditional narrative films and took to biographical material to achieve greater freedom of expression. His first venture in this genre was with a documentary film based on Satyajit Ray&#x27;s life, &quot;Satyajit Ray&quot;, in 1985. This was followed by works such as &quot;Sardari Begum&quot; (1996) and &quot;Zubeidaa&quot;, which was written by filmmaker and critic Khalid Mohamed.

In 1985 he was a member of the jury at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival.

===The 1990s and beyond===
The 1990s saw Shyam Benegal making a trilogy on Indian Muslim women, starting with &quot;Mammo&quot; (1994), &quot;Sardari Begum&quot; (1996) and &quot;Zubeidaa&quot; (2001). With &quot;Zubeidaa&quot;, he entered mainstream Bollywood, as it starred top Bollywood star Karishma Kapoor and boasted music by A. R. Rahman.

In 1992, he made &quot;Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda&quot; (&quot;Seventh Horse of the Sun&quot;), based on a novel by Dharmavir Bharati, which won the 1993 National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. In 1996 he made another film based on the book &quot;The Making of the Mahatma&quot;, based on Fatima Meer&#x27;s, &quot;The Apprenticeship of a Mahatma&quot;. This turn to biographical material resulted in &quot;Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero&quot;, his 2005 English language film. He criticised the Indian caste system in &quot;Samar&quot; (1999), which went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film.

Benegal served as a president of the president of the Federation of Film Societies of India. He was the owner of a production company called Sahyadri Films.

He was the author of three books based on his own films: &quot;The Churning&quot; with Vijay Tendulkar (1984), which was based on &quot;Manthan&quot;; &quot;Satyajit Ray&quot; (1988), based on his biographical cinema, &quot;Satyajit Ray&quot;; and &quot;The Marketplace&quot; (1989), based on &quot;Mandi&quot;.

In 2009 he was a member of the jury at the 31st Moscow International Film Festival.

===Later projects===
In 2008, his film &quot;Welcome to Sajjanpur&quot;, starring Shreyas Talpade and Amrita Rao, was released to a good response. Its music was composed by Shantanu Moitra, and it was produced by Chetan Motiwalla. Shyam Benegal is slated to direct an epic musical, &quot;Chamki Chameli&quot;, inspired by Georges Bizet&#x27;s classic Spanish opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. The story revolves around the eponymous Chamki, a beautiful gypsy girl with a fiery temper and is written by Shama Zaidi. The music is by A. R. Rahman and lyrics are by Javed Akhtar.

In March 2010, Benegal released the political satire &quot;Well Done Abba&quot;.

One of Benegal&#x27;s last projects was a film based on the life of Noor Inayat Khan, daughter of Inayat Khan and descendant of Tipu Sultan, who served as a British spy during World War II.

Benegal made a comeback on the small screen with &quot;Samvidhaan&quot;, a 10-part mini-series revolving around the making of the Indian Constitution, to be aired on Rajya Sabha TV from 2 March 2014.

Government of Bangladesh has confirmed Benegal would direct the biopic of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman named &quot;&quot;. The film was released in 2023.

==Personal life and death==
Shyam Benegal was married to Nira Benegal and had a daughter, Pia Benegal, a costume designer, who worked for many films.

Benegal died of kidney disease at Wockhardt Hospital Mumbai Central, on 23 December 2024, at the age of 90.

<doc id="892946" wikidata="Q3661056" url="?curid=892946" title="Ouimet Canyon">
<text>Ouimet Canyon is a large gorge in the municipality of Dorion, Thunder Bay District in northwestern Ontario, Canada, about northeast of the city of Thunder Bay. The gorge is deep, wide and long, protected as part of Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park.

There is a walkway consisting of boardwalks and trails, which leads to viewing platforms overlooking the canyon. Visitors to the canyon should remain on the marked trails for their own safety. Also in the Ouimet Canyon area, there are rare alpine flowers that are considered especially beautiful and arctic plants normally found one thousand kilometres further north. The canyon is shown in the IMAX film &quot;North of Superior&quot;.

The canyon was named after the former railway station of Ouimet, located nearby on the Canadian Pacific Railway line. The station itself was named after the Canadian Minister of Public Works from 1892 to 1896, Joseph-Aldric Ouimet.

Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park, a day-use park with no camping facilities, covers an area of  around the canyon.

==Geology==
The canyon is believed to have formed when a diabase sill dating from a billion years earlier was split open, either by the weight of advancing glaciers or the large volumes of water released during their retreat. Erosion by wind and rain continued the formation of the canyon. A large rock column known as the Indian Head can be seen from the northern viewing area.

==Eagle Canyon==

Near Ouimet Canyon is the privately owned and operated Eagle Canyon, which features on-site camping, two footbridges spanning the gorge and a zip line.

The longer of the two footbridges is long and is suspended above the canyon floor. It claims to be Canada&#x27;s longest foot suspension bridge, but is not, because Souris swinging bridge in Manitoba, re-built in 2013 is 604 ft long The zip line is claimed to be long and is advertised as Canada&#x27;s longest, highest () and fastest ().

<doc id="892948" wikidata="Q127582" url="?curid=892948" title="Andre Dawson">
<text>Andre Nolan Dawson (born July 10, 1954), nicknamed &quot;the Hawk&quot; and &quot;Awesome Dawson&quot;, is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for four different teams as a center and right fielder, spending most of his career with the Montreal Expos and Chicago Cubs.

An 8-time National League (NL) All-Star, he was named the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year in 1977 after batting .282 with 19 home runs and 65 runs batted in (RBI), and won the Most Valuable Player Award in 1987 after leading the league with 49 homers and 137 RBI; he had been runner-up for the award in both 1981 and 1983. He batted .300 five times, drove in 100 runs four times and had 13 seasons of 20 home runs. A strong base-runner early in his career, he also stole 30 bases three times. He is one of eight MLB players with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases during his career.

Dawson was a center fielder until knee problems – worsened by the artificial surface at Olympic Stadium – forced his shift to right field, followed by his move to a team which played on grass. He led the NL in outfield putouts three consecutive years (1981–1983), and won eight Gold Glove Awards for fielding excellence. Dawson was known for his incredible work ethic and study of the game. He was often seen in the dugout with a clipboard in-hand documenting pitches and pitcher tendencies. This was long before such practices were common-place and such information was readily available. Upon his retirement, his NL totals of 409 home runs and 962 extra base hits both ranked tenth in league history; he also ranked seventh in NL history in games as an outfielder (2,303), and sixth in both outfield putouts (5,116) and total chances (5,366). He set Expos franchise records for career games, at bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, runs batted in, extra base hits, total bases, and steals, all of which have since been broken variously by Tim Raines, Tim Wallach and Vladimir Guerrero. In 2010, Dawson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Dawson grew up in Florida as the oldest of eight children. His father was a major general in the United States Army and often absent, leaving Dawson to look after his seven younger siblings while his mother worked. Dawson would pay his younger brothers in cookies to toss him rocks for him to hit with a broomstick as batting practice.

Dawson&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Hawk&quot;, was given to him by an uncle at a very early age. Dawson used to work out with a men&#x27;s team that would hit him ground balls at practice. Dawson&#x27;s uncle told him that most kids his age would shy away from the ball, but Dawson attacked the ball like a hawk.

Dawson attended and graduated from Southwest Miami Senior High School in 1972. In high school, he suffered multiple knee injuries which hampered his athletic development. He did not draw any attention from professional scouts or college recruiters and took out student loans in order to enroll at Florida A&amp;M University.

At Florida A&amp;M, Dawson walked on to the Rattlers baseball team as a freshman. He spent three years at Florida A&amp;M which he later said paved the way for his future.

==Playing career==

===Montreal Expos===
Dawson was selected by the Expos in the 11th round (pick #250) of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft. He played in 24 major league games in 1976 after making his debut on September 11. His stardom rose in 1977 when he became an everyday outfielder for the Expos, and batted .282 with 19 home runs and 21 stolen bases. He was awarded the 1977 Rookie of the Year in the National League, narrowly beating out Steve Henderson of the New York Mets. Dawson had a blend of power and speed, hitting at least 20 home runs in seven seasons with the Expos, and stealing at least 20 bases in his first seven seasons. Dawson, playing primarily center field for the Expos, also became an excellent defensive player, gaining his first of eight Gold Glove Awards in 1980. Based on his all-around excellence, Dawson was second in the National League MVP voting in 1981 (won by Mike Schmidt) and second again in 1983 (won by Dale Murphy). He was voted the Montreal Expos Player of the Year in 1981 and 1983.

Dawson played 1,443 games with the Expos, fourth highest in franchise history, and set single-season club records for home runs (32, now seventh), RBI (113, now fourth), extra base hits (78, now seventh), and sacrifice flies (18, still first). He still holds the Expos career record for sacrifice flies (71), and is the only player to hit 200 home runs and steal 200 bases with Montreal. During his Expos days, Dawson hit two home runs in the same inning twice: at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium against the Atlanta Braves on July 30, 1978 and at Wrigley Field against his future team, the Chicago Cubs, on September 24, 1985. As of 2021, Dawson, Willie McCovey, Jeff King, Alex Rodriguez, and Edwin Encarnación are the only five players to hit two home runs in one inning twice.

In 1984, Dawson appeared in &quot;The Cap&quot;, a short film about a young boy living in Montreal who was given a baseball cap by Dawson.

===Chicago Cubs===
Dawson played for the Expos until after the 1986 season when he became a free agent and sought a team whose home field had natural grass, as his knee injuries were aggravated by Olympic Stadium&#x27;s artificial turf. However, due to collusion on the part of the Major League Baseball owners, he was unable to attract offers.

Dawson campaigned for the Cubs to sign him during the off-season, however general manager Dallas Green resisted, insisting the Cubs would start Brian Dayett in right field (Dawson had moved from center field to right field in his final two seasons with the Expos, due to the condition of his knees), and that one player could not make a 71–91 team a 91–71 team. When the Cubs opened camp in Mesa, Arizona, that spring, Dawson and his agent Dick Moss arrived with a signed blank contract in an attempt to secure a contract with the Cubs. Dawson and Moss&#x27; stunt was derided as a &quot;dog and pony show&quot; by Green. After reviewing the contract, Green reached an agreement with Moss on a salary of $500,000 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars), second-lowest on the team among regulars, and added bonuses of $150,000 if he did not go on the disabled list by the All-Star Game break and $50,000 if he made the All-Star team. He earned both. The team also wrote in $100,000 bonuses if Dawson was MVP of either the league championship series or the World Series, but did not add a clause for National League MVP. While he won the NL MVP, the Cubs did not make the playoffs, so he had no chance to earn the NLCS or World Series MVP.

He became the Cubs&#x27; starting right fielder, and hit an MLB-leading 49 home runs (equal with Oakland Athletics rookie Mark McGwire), the most a player had hit since George Foster in 1977 and Willie Mays in 1965. He was named the league&#x27;s MVP, finally winning after the two years as runner-up in Montreal. He also earned his fourth All-Star nod and won the Home Run Derby that year. Although the Cubs held first place for nearly half of May and remained in contention through July, the team finished the 1987 season 76–85, last in the National League East.

Dawson was the first player to win a league MVP trophy from a last place team. Dawson played five more seasons with the Cubs, and was one of the franchise&#x27;s most popular players during that time. His worst individual season came in 1989 when the Cubs won the National League East title. During the NL Championship Series that year, Dawson batted .105 as the San Francisco Giants beat the Cubs 4 games to 1. Dawson&#x27;s .507 career slugging percentage with the Cubs is fourth highest in team history.

===Later career===

In October 1992 the Red Sox signed Dawson as a free agent. Dawson hit his 400th career home run with the Red Sox on April 15 at Fenway Park. Dawson sustained a knee injury early in the 1993 season in a game against the Texas Rangers which limited him to only 121 games in his first year with the Red Sox: &quot;I got caught between sliding and standing up on a passed ball. I was on second base, and I took a chop step between strides and hit the corner of the third-base bag. I had knee surgery and [Boston] decided to use me in the DH role.&quot;

Dawson would have knee surgery the following year as well, and only managed to play 75 games in his second and final season with Boston. Dawson played his last two years with the Florida Marlins, where he played sparingly, retiring after the 1996 season. In his final game, Dawson was removed from the field as a final farewell to the fans and the game. The fans gave him a standing ovation as Dawson walked off the field.

==Accomplishments==

Dawson finished his career with 2,774 hits, 438 home runs, 314 stolen bases, and 1,591 RBI. He is one of only eight players in major league history to record over 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases in his career (300-300 club); the other players to accomplish this are Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Reggie Sanders, Steve Finley, Alex Rodriguez and Carlos Beltrán. Dawson is also one of only five members of the 400 HR-300 SB club, along with Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Alex Rodriguez, and Carlos Beltrán.

In 1997, Dawson&#x27;s #10 was retired by the Montreal Expos in his honor (the number had been previously retired for Rusty Staub). After the franchise moved to Washington, the Montreal Canadiens raised a banner in the Bell Centre to commemorate all of the retired Expos numbers, including Dawson&#x27;s. In 2010 the Washington Nationals franchise placed Dawson in its &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; at Nationals Park. In 2019, Dawson was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.

===Hall of Fame===
Dawson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010, his ninth year of eligibility, rising from an initial vote total of 45.3% in 2002 to 77.9% in 2010. Dawson&#x27;s Hall of Fame plaque depicts him with a Montreal Expos cap. Dawson objected to the choice of the Expos logo at the time and in 2023 he petitioned for the Hall of Fame to change the logo on his cap to a Chicago Cubs logo.

The major impediments to Dawson&#x27;s election to the Hall had been his ordinary career .323 on-base percentage (albeit accumulated before OBP was even a statistic, and many multi-time All-Stars and even Hall of Famers had even lower), his statistics being diminished in stature by sluggers who played after him in the steroid era, and never playing in a World Series. Cubs teammate Ryne Sandberg campaigned for Dawson&#x27;s induction during his speech at his own Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2005: &quot;No player in baseball history worked harder, suffered more or did it better than Andre Dawson. He&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. I watched him win an MVP for a last-place team in 1987 [with the Cubs], and it was the most unbelievable thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in baseball. He did it the right way, the natural way, and he did it in the field and on the bases and in every way, and I hope he will stand up here someday.&quot;
Dawson was the second player in the Hall of Fame whose plaque depicts him with an Expos logo, after Gary Carter. Though Dawson had played most of his 21-year career with Montreal, he publicly expressed his disappointment with the decision, saying it was &quot;a little gut-wrenching&quot; to find out he would not go in as a Chicago Cub. Dawson&#x27;s reluctance to be enshrined as an Expo stemmed, in part, from the breakdown of his relationship with the team during MLB&#x27;s collusion scandal of 1986–87, when he claimed the team not only &quot;threw him out&quot; of Montreal but tried to prevent other teams from signing him as a free agent. In late 2023, Dawson sent a letter to the Hall of Fame again requesting that the cap on his plaque be changed to a Cubs hat, but the plaque has not changed.

While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987. The Hall noted that &quot;Dawson had 1,575 of his 2,774 hits as an Expo, won six of his eight Gold Glove awards in Montreal and led the Expos to their only postseason series win,&quot; the 1981 NLDS win that was also the only postseason win in Dawson&#x27;s career.

==Retirement and personal life==
Dawson married the former Vanessa Turner and had two children, Darius in August 1989 and Amber in September 1990.

Shortly after retiring as a player, Dawson returned to the Marlins to accept a position in the team&#x27;s front office, where he got his first World Series ring in 2003.

Dawson owns the Paradise Memorial Funeral Home in Richmond Heights, Florida. He entered the funeral business in 2003, investing in a funeral home his younger brother owned, and became the owner and operator of Paradise Memorial in 2008. In an April 2020 Associated Press story on how he and his business dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, he said, &quot;It’s very sad. Because people mourn and grieve differently, and they’re not getting through that process as they would under normal circumstances. You see a lot of hurt and pain.&quot; At that time, his wife Vanessa was the office manager, while an uncle ran day-to-day operations.

Dawson also owned The Mahogany Grille, a soul food restaurant in Miami Gardens, Florida.

Dawson has regularly attended Chicago Cubs functions since his retirement and is a fan favorite. Dawson appeared in a 2012 &quot;Discount Double-Check&quot; commercial for State Farm Insurance with former Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood.

Dawson released his autobiography, &quot;If You Love This Game: An MVP&#x27;s Life in Baseball&quot;, in May 2012.

Though Dawson batted and threw right-handed, he writes with his left hand.

<doc id="892953" wikidata="Q1968873" url="?curid=892953" title="Vendsyssel">
<text>Vendsyssel () is the northernmost traditional district of Denmark and of Jutland. Being divided from mainland Jutland by the Limfjord, it is technically a part of the North Jutlandic Island which also comprises the areas Hanherred and Thy. Vendsyssel is part of the North Denmark Region.
Vendsyssel neighbours Hanherred to the southwest and Himmerland to the south, across the Limfjord. Whether the island Læsø is also a part of Vendsyssel, is a matter of definition. The major towns of Vendsyssel are Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Sæby, Hirtshals, Løkken, Nørresundby and, on its northern tip, Skagen. The dominating city is, however, Aalborg which is mainly situated outside Vendsyssel on the southern shore of the Limfjord with Nørresundby as a secondary, northern centre.

==Etymology==
Adam of Bremen (ca. 1075) calls Vendsyssel Wendila, Ælnoth (ca. 1100) calls it Wendel, the Icelandic literature Vendill or Vandill. Derived from this is the ethnic name wændlar, Danish vendelboer, which is part of the name of the &quot;syssel&quot;. In the Danish Census Book (Kong Valdemars Jordebog, ca. 1231) Wændlesysæl, Wendelsysel, Wændil. Presumably originally the name of the Limfjord, then name of the region north of it. 

According to historians and linguists, the name Vendsyssel may be derived from the Germanic tribe of the Vandals. Syssel is an ancient form of administrative region. Vendel (Old Danish &quot;Wændil&quot;) was also the ancient name of the Limfjord itself.

==Places of interest==

* Hirtshals lighthouse
* North Sea Oceanarium
* Rubjerg Knude lighthouse
* Vendsyssel Historical Museum

==Events==
The largest classical music festival in Scandinavia is the Vendsyssel Festival in the summer.

==Infrastructure==
Vendsyssel is an important gatehead for transport from the European continent to Norway and Western Sweden. The European routes E39 and E45 cross the area as motorways. National route 11 connects Vendsyssel with Hanherred and Thy before crossing the Limfjord to western Jutland on the Oddesund Bridge. Danish national road 40 also passes through Vendsyssel.

===Bridges===
Vendsyssel is linked to mainland Jutland by bridges and a tunnel:
*Limfjord Railroad Bridge (in Aalborg, linking Vendsyssel to the rail network)
*Limfjord Bridge (road, linking Nørresundby to central Aalborg)
*Limfjord Tunnel (motorway E45, east of Aalborg)
*A further bridge crossing the Limfjord west of Aalborg (carrying the E39) has been proposed.

===Railways===
*Skagen-Frederikshavn-Hjørring-Brønderslev-Aalborg, Nordjyske Jernbaner, single track, hourly Intercity trains. From Aalborg there are connections to Århus and Copenhagen
*Hjørring-Hirtshals, local railway (and transit to Norway) operated by Nordjyske Jernbaner

<text>Shepperton is a village in the Spelthorne district, in north Surrey, England, around south west of central London. The settlement is on the north bank of the River Thames, between the towns of Chertsey and Sunbury-on-Thames. The village is mentioned in a document of 959 AD and in Domesday Book.

In the 19th century, resident writers and poets included Rider Haggard, Thomas Love Peacock, George Meredith, and Percy Bysshe Shelley, who were attracted by the proximity of the River Thames. The river was painted at Walton Bridge in 1754 by Canaletto and in 1805 by Turner. Shepperton Lock and nearby Sunbury Lock were built in the 1810s, to facilitate river navigation.

Urbanisation began in the latter part of the 19th century, with the construction in 1864 of the Shepperton Branch Line, which was sponsored by William Schaw Lindsay, the owner of Shepperton Manor. Its population rose from 1,810 residents in the early 20th century to a little short of 10,000 in 2011. Lindsay had hoped to extend the railway via Chertsey to connect to the South Western Main Line, however the village station remains a terminus. The rise in population and passing trade led to small businesses lining most of its high street by the end of the 20th century.

Shepperton Film Studios is in the neighbouring village of Littleton, approximately to the north. The Swan Sanctuary and two SSSIs, one of which is managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust, are nearby.

== Toponymy ==
The first written record of Shepperton is from a charter of 959, in which it appears as &quot;Scepertune&quot;. The name is thought to derive from the Old English scēp (sheep), hirde (herdsman) and tūn (enclosure, farm or settlement). The name is generally agreed to mean &quot;shepherd&#x27;s farm&quot; or &quot;shepherd&#x27;s settlement&quot;.

== History ==
===Early history===

The earliest evidence of human activity in the local area is from the middle Neolithic. A henge, taking the form of a penannular ring ditch, was discovered in the late 1980s, close to the River Ash, to the north of Shepperton Green. The structure was around in diameter and is thought to have been constructed BCE. The main entrance to the henge was aligned with the position of the sun at sunrise on the summer solstice and lumps of red ochre had been placed inside the ditch to mark the position of the most southerly moonrise. The ditch appeared to have been refilled and re-excavated in the late Neolithic. Two burials were discovered at the site - a torso, probably male, and an almost complete skeleton of a female. Radiocarbon dating showed that the woman had lived in the late 3rd millennium BCE and analysis of the isotope composition of her teeth suggested that she had grown up in an area where lead-zinc ore was found, possibly Derbyshire, the Mendips or the North Pennines. A reconstruction of the face of the woman from the skull was created at the University of Manchester in 2004.

Finds from the Iron Age include an inhumation of a woman in her 40s, found on Chertsey Road, and iron swords, discovered at Shepperton Ranges. Pewter plates, from the latter site, are thought to date from the late Roman period. Evidence of late-Iron Age and Saxon settlements was found at Shepperton Green in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

===Later history===
Shepperton is recorded in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Scepertone&quot;. It had a population of 25 households and was held by Westminster Abbey; (excluding any woodland, marsh and heath) it had eight hides, pasture for seven carucates and one weir (worth 6s 8d per year). In total, the annual amount rendered was £6.

The Church Lane and Church Square area, leading to and next to the river predates by several centuries the High Street as the village nucleus. When the Thames Valley Railway built in 1864 the terminus of Shepperton railway station, north, for the 12 initial years a single train and track running to and from Strawberry Hill, the village slowly expanded into its northern fields. Its coming which was largely due to contributions and permission of W. S. Lindsay the owner of Shepperton&#x27;s manor.

The River Thames was important for transport from the late 13th century and carried barley, wheat, peas and root vegetables to London&#x27;s markets; later timber, building materials such as bricks, sand and lime, and gunpowder, see the Wey Navigation.

While the village was wholly agricultural until the 19th century, there are originally expensive gravestones of the local minor gentry in the churchyard, two of which are dedicated to their naturalised black servants, Benjamin and Cotto Blake who both died in 1781. These bear the inscription &quot;Davo aptio, Argo fidelior, ipso Sanchone facetior&quot;. During this long period since the conquest the wealth of the local rector and his bishop was great: William Grocyn was rector 1504–1513 and was an Oxford classical academic who corresponded regularly with Erasmus and Lewis Atterbury (1707–31) expended much of the large parish revenues on having the large tower rebuilt.
A large net income of rents and tithes of £499 per year was paid to the rectory belonging to S. H. Russell in 1848; this compares to £600 of poor relief, including for supporting its workhouse, paid out in 1829.

A change to secular council-administered rather than church-administered public services followed the establishment of poor law unions and Sanitary Districts and was completed with the founding, in 1889, of the Middlesex County Council and Staines Rural District from 1896. In 1930 on the rural district&#x27;s abolition, Shepperton became part of the Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District until its dissolution into a reduced and reconfigured county of Surrey in 1965. Three districts of the historic county thus did not become part of Greater London: Staines Urban District also joined Surrey and Potters Bar Urban District joined Hertfordshire. In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 6060. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

;Use in semi-fiction and alleged hauntings
In semi-fiction, George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life telling the Sad Fortunes of The Rev. Amos Barton&quot;, gives a thinly veiled picture of Chilvers Coton&#x27;s church and village in the early 19th century in which she uses the name Shepperton. If anything real is to be gleaned for its use, it is perhaps a passing similarity. &quot;Shepperton Manor&quot; by John Mason Neale was contemporaneously written in 1844 fifteen years after he had spent six years living in the village. Old parts of Shepperton are said to be haunted by the ghost of a headless monk. Battlecrease Hall (formerly home to Walter Hayes, Ford Motor Company executive and a founder of the company&#x27;s Formula One programme) is alleged by its owners and certain visitors to have poltergeists.

===Conservation areas===

====Church Square in Old Shepperton====
Leading to this is a short, since 1989 bypassed, winding lane from the High Street to Church Square, flanked by Shepperton Manor and the cricket ground, with some listed walls. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner described the view looking towards the south-east of the square with its now listed buildings and river opening as &quot;one of the most perfect village pictures that the area has to offer&quot;. It offers two pub/restaurants two hotels, the Anchor Hotel and the Warren Lodge Hotel. In this little square there is also the King&#x27;s Head public house.

The riverside manor, late 18th century, (its predecessor, as with the church here, predates the 12th century), features a room painted and rendered to look like a tent or draped damask. Also Grade II* listed is the c. 1500 timber framed Old Rectory refronted in the early 18th century, and including a reception hall built in 1498. Its front cladding has mathematical tiles.

Listed in the same high category of listed building is the parish church, St Nicholas&#x27; – its dedication is as with the ancient riverside churches of Thames Ditton and Chiswick. Also architecturally Grade II* is restored half timbered Winches Cottage on the west side of the lane which is 17th century.

====Lower Halliford====
The village includes the neighbourhood of Lower Halliford, formerly a near but separate hamlet, which historian Susan Reynolds places at the eastern end of a reduced, river bend-consumed half of the early medieval village, east of the Old Shepperton Conservation Area due to erosion.

This area is typified by a small number of detached classical three-storey 18th century riverside houses high on the riverside road on the outside of the river bend; the bend being flanked by riverside meadows with small boat moorings, low rise chalet-style houses to the south west, the &quot;Las Palmas Estate&quot;, named after the land once being that of the Spanish Ambassador; further west by the wooded Shepperton Cricket Club and by the village Green, Bishop Duppas Park to the east, formerly Lower Halliford Common and in a small part owned by the Old Manor House (Halliford).

From the 1760s—1860s a ropery was an industry here then from the 1860s—1870s brick clay was extracted.

Halliford Manor, confusingly also called The Old Manor, dates to at least the 13th century and ownership became royal, being held by Elizabeth I and the wives of Charles I and Charles II. The Bishop of Winchester, Brian Duppa (1588–1662) owned the waterside meadows adjoining to the south and was also an important landowner in Croydon&#x27;s history, &quot;see Duppas Hill&quot;. Wealthy writers built or expanded homes here in the 19th century, primarily as summer residences, such as Rider Haggard, Thomas Love Peacock, George Meredith and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

The Old Manor became yet another rebuilt Georgian house. The house which features a modillioned eaves cornice and glazing-bar sash windows to the first floor. Halliford School in the centre of this area was the 18th–19th century home of Emma Hamilton, mistress of Admiral Nelson.

The 21st century fully renovated hotel and restaurant (formerly &quot;the Ship&quot;), &quot;Harrison&#x27;s&quot; with river views is here beside the shorter Red Lion public house which in turn has a narrow, secluded south-facing public house picnic area overlooking the relatively narrow, non-tidal river Thames. It is for this reason a bridge and ferry was recorded here from 1274 to 1410.

The tern is applicable also to the mostly riverside homes and public park almost surrounded by the River Thames, south of the road from Kingston to Chertsey including next to Walton Bridge by Walton on Thames. The main park is Bishop Duppas Park and almost surrounds completely the Old Manor.

There is mention of Halliford in 962 and there was a settlement there by 1194. However the division into Upper and Lower Halliford does not appear until the late 13th century. Upper Halliford is a large hamlet in the parish of Sunbury, but Lower Halliford was almost certainly the main settlement of the manor. The creation of Desborough Cut diverted the main navigation of the Thames away from the Lower Halliford and Shepperton loop, rendering flooding far less common.

The poet Thomas Love Peacock lived at Elm Bank House here from 1822 until his death in 1866.

====Manygate Lane====
The field land and large houses on this estate were bought by Lyon Homes from landowner and developer Edward Scott in the 1950s.

This estate of buildings on this street are in a conservation area for proving a successful modular development in geometric, white-painted modernism from in the 1960s, one of very few private sector &quot;estate housing&quot; experiments of the 1960s with terraced, white panelled communal landscaped front gardens by Swiss architect Edward Schoolheifer; this American Radburn style was also used by Eric Lyons &quot;Span Developments&quot; in Ham Common, Richmond, London, Blackheath, London and New Ash Green, Kent.

==Localities==
The conservation areas of Old Shepperton and Lower Halliford are localities, as is Littleton.

===Charlton===
&lt;br&gt;
Charlton is a suburban hamlet and narrow area to the north, bounded to the west by the Queen Mary Reservoir in Littleton, bounded to the east and south by Thames water treatment works from that reservoir and by the M3 motorway. As a well-developed hamlet, bounded by farms, it also referred to as a village or neighbourhood. Its post town is Shepperton. Its parish is Sunbury-on-Thames. In the south of the neighbourhood, on the Shepperton side of the motorway are a general waste transfer station, further fields and Sunbury Golf Course, which has 18 holes and is bisected by the Shepperton railway line.

Charlton appears in Domesday Book as &quot;Cerdentone&quot;. It was held by Roger de Rames. Its domesday assets were: 5 hides; 1½ ploughs (with potential for 3½), meadow for 4 ploughs, cattle pasture. It rendered £1 10s 0d. However this manor was in the parish of Sunbury and unlike the three adjoining manors, Shepperton, Halliford and Sunbury did not reach down to the river public meadowlands, used for grazing of animals.

===Shepperton Green===
&lt;br&gt;
Shepperton Green is that part of the village which continues immediately west of the M3 motorway, north-west of the village centre. Across the River Ash, Surrey, which is no more than a stream most of the year, adjoining, to its north is Littleton. Taken together with Littleton, three farms operate on the edges of this conjoined residential area, providing a buffer to the north and west. Shepperton&#x27;s central SSSI is on the south side of the motorway &quot;Sheep Lake Walk and meadows&quot;, managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust. To the west are large lakes (one sifted and worked for gravel). This means that Shepperton Green with Littleton is buffered to all sides, except for its eastern side with its road bridge to Shepperton proper, classified as Shepperton Town ward and county council electoral division. This area is currently grouped with Laleham for all local elections.

==High Street and economy==
Shepperton has a traditional high street, shorter than that at nearby Ashford with two medium-size supermarkets, village hall, library, shops, optician, hairdressers, a wide range of restaurants, several cafés, with the railway terminus at the northern end.

Shepperton railway station saw high ticketed entries and exits for a settlement of its size to 422,000 (6 April 2010 – 5 April 2011), being a terminus with main commercial destinations being in the City of London, Kingston upon Thames. commercial hubs of West London and South London accessed along the route; this is supplemented by secondary school usage, with a substantial state school and private school.

===History board===
The Village Hall in the High Street has a large depiction of the economic life and of the history of the village. In October 2011, a group of children from St Nicholas C of E Primary School won a competition to create the history board, which was then edited by a graphic designer and officially opened by the mayor with a large ceremony and some press, after Sunbury had held a similar competition. The board itself includes a grassland to represent the pastures and provides local information.

==Public services==
Four infant/junior/primary schools, a senior comprehensive school and senior private school are in the village.

&quot;See List of schools in Surrey&quot;

Home Office policing in Shepperton is provided by Surrey Police. Public transport is co-ordinated by Surrey County Council who also provide the statutory emergency fire and rescue service who have a station in Sunbury.&quot;

St Peter&#x27;s Hospital on the far side of Chertsey is a large NHS hospital administrated by Ashford and St Peter&#x27;s Hospitals NHS Trust. It was opened under its existing name in 1947. The South East Coast Ambulance Service Foundation Trust provides emergency patient transport to and from this facility. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by several small clinics and surgeries.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Surrey Waste Disposal Authority and domestic waste collected by Spelthorne Borough Council. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill in Alfold and Shefford, and a proportion to energy from waste plants in Slough and Kent to lower landfill tax. Plans have been approved to permit gasification in Charlton in the north of the Shepperton post town as part of the county&#x27;s Eco Park to take up to half of the county&#x27;s residual waste. Shepperton&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is UK Power Networks; aside from renewables there are no power stations in the area. Thames Water manages Shepperton&#x27;s drinking and waste water; water supplies being sourced from the London sources including several reservoirs fed by the River Thames locally. There are water treatment works at Ashford, Hampton and sewage treatment works at Isleworth.

==Topography==
Shepperton has a long boundary with the River Thames in its southernmost salient, which almost surrounds Spelthorne. Old Shepperton is almost surrounded by the extreme southern meander within this. Prehistoric glacial retreat north of this has made the north bank almost flat for a considerable distance and as such, elevation never exceeds 14 m above mean sea level (on the border of Laleham). The river never exceeds 11.5 m, (beside Dumsey Meadow and under Chertsey Bridge). The lowest elevation is 9 m in flood meadows at the confluence of the Ash with the Thames. The Ash is the border with Littleton and Sunbury-on-Thames (mostly, to the northeast, with its technical hamlet, Upper Halliford).

Dumsey Meadow SSSI is the only piece of undeveloped, unfenced water meadow by the river remaining on the River Thames below Caversham, and is home to a variety of rare plants and insects.

The Swan Sanctuary moved to an old gravel extraction site by Fordbridge Road in 2005 from its former base in Egham.

On the opposite bank are in downstream order are Chertsey Bridge and Chertsey Meads, the Hamm Court area of Addlestone, three islands, (the first two of which have multiple properties) (Lock, Hamhaugh and D&#x27;Oyly Carte, one large man-made island, (Desborough), and the riverside parts of Walton on Thames, the upstream part of which is also open land, Cowey Sale Park. The towpath is the official route of three passing through the Shepperton reaches (of the Thames Path) as heading upstream from Hampton Court Palace another marked version takes Walton Bridge, the official version takes the Shepperton-Weybridge Ferry and another marked version crosses to the north bank at Chertsey Bridge.

;Upper Halliford

Upper Halliford has since the early 20th century been in Shepperton post town, and almost , but with its own station, residential roads, fair and shopping parade, even an Upper Halliford Village sign. Arguably in modern analysis it is a village, with the second highest concentration of development in the post town.

;Shepperton Green
This neighbourhood is smaller than the adjoining village, separated by the M3 motorway and some adjoining meadows and fields. The second of the borough&#x27;s Green Belt SSSIs, Sheep Walk Meadows, is a key feature of Shepperton Green, bounding it, to its south. A Saxon and medieval burial ground gives its name to the Saxon Junior School who use it for playing fields and has Scheduled status. A farm combined with a significant amount of fishing and gravel lakes form the outskirts and within the clustered settlement an estate of the homes was built as non-serving personally barracks for the British Army.

== Demography and housing ==

===Historic figures===
The population of Shepperton, according to the census of 1801, was 731. This number increased gradually to 858 forty years later, increasing further to the end of the 19th century. Between 1891 and 1901 its population rose by 511 to 1,810. The population also rose substantially between 1931 and 1951, to 6,060 people. Data for 1801–1951 is available at Britain Through Time. The 2001 and 2011 Censuses give detailed information about the Town ward and Shepperton Green.

===Other===
The settlement had 9,753 residents, living in 4,301 households. Of those, 83.6% of residents described their health as &#x27;good&#x27;, for this overall figure, above the regional average. Of these people 47.3% described their health as very good, below the regional average. 20.4% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no work qualifications, below the English average of 22.5%. In 2011 the area had only 114 people who were in the category &quot;never worked/long-term unemployed&quot;.

===Housing, area and population===
The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Culture==

===Film===

====Shepperton Studios====

Shepperton Studios is home to a multi-disciplinary film production facility from on-set, through to television and various forms of animation. This also acts as a base for on-location film work for television dramas in the South East and in films, for instance for productions partly shot in the Burnham Beeches woods less than away. These adjoin Shepperton Green, in the now negligible village of Littleton. In the 1930s its Littleton manor&#x27;s core, which covered was converted into film production lots. This was reduced to in 1973. Works produced or shot wholly or in part on its 15 stages, other lots or in its extensive animation facilities since the new millennium include:

====Halliford Studios====
Lower Halliford, a completely so also integral part of Shepperton, used to be home to Halliford Film Studios, opposite the Manygate Lane conservation area, built in 1955 and one of the first film studios devoted to TV commercial production. It was an independent film studio used for commercials, small television productions and other short &quot;promos&quot;. The studio was recently closed and demolished.

===Literature===
George Eliot depicted Shepperton as set out above.

Shepperton was the home of author J. G. Ballard, the so-called &quot;Seer of Shepperton&quot;, and provides the setting for his novels &quot;Crash&quot; (in which a couple become sexually aroused through car crashes and was written as the M3 motorway was being built past the end of his street) and &quot;The Unlimited Dream Company&quot;.

Shepperton is mentioned in the novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells, in which its destruction is described along with nearby settlements.

It is also mentioned in the novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles Dickens, where Bill Sikes tempts Oliver into visiting a house there, but instead, when they get there, Oliver is dragged on to a lonely house nearby by Sikes.

===Fine art===

J. M. W. Turner painted in 1805 two scenes of the shimmering river and fishermen on the far banks of the Lower Halliford part of Shepperton including the wide landscape work &quot;Walton Bridges&quot; widely exhibited in 1807 following a previous similar work by Canaletto of the scene in 1754.

==Sport and recreation==
There are recreation grounds for football on both sides of the M3: one in Shepperton Green and two in Shepperton/Lower Halliford; one has adjoining tennis courts. Through the town there is the Thames Path and there are popular adjacent flat cycling routes to Windsor, Hampton Court Palace and Richmond. There is a golf course north of the station in the historic parish of Sunbury so anachronistically named &quot;Sunbury Golf Club&quot; and for a time &quot;American Golf at Sunbury&quot; with two courses, a driving range and Crown Golf Academy as Sunbury is a larger settlement.

Desborough Sailing Club is based here with its own dinghy basin, private inlet and secluded reach of the river Thames and international medal-winner training club Queen Mary Reservoir Sailing Club lies between Shepperton and Ashford.

Angling is substantial at Halliford Mere fisheries and on the River Thames itself.

Shepperton has a thriving cricket club, which has teams in the Fullers Surrey County League.

==Places of worship==
There are several churches in the village covering three denominations of Christianity.

The architecturally listed stone-clad church to St Nicholas on the preserved village square (Church of England) is led by the rector of Shepperton, Rev Chris Swift and is committed to helping the largest Shepperton primary school and contributes to a wide range of local good causes.

Founded in 1936, St John Fisher Roman Catholic church led by Fr Shaun Richards adopts a vibrant approach to parish life involving &quot;Prayer, Partnership, Pilgrimage, and Panto&quot; the last two of which are annual and the first two of which are intended to be daily or regular activities of its believers. The parish places emphasis on helping the housebound and sick, CAFOD and takes part in the Westminster Diocese pilgrimage to Lourdes.

Jubilee Church, Shepperton was formed as a new church in 1982 to celebrate in modern &quot;mainstream Christianity&quot; being less focussed on ceremony than the two oldest UK churches. Its twin values are: &quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart  ... and your neighbour as your self.&quot; and Make disciples.

Littleton has a co-led Church of England; Upper Halliford has a Baptist church for further details of which see those articles.

<text>Sheryl Lynn Herring (born September 22, 1958) is an American actress and beauty pageant titleholder. She is perhaps best known for her role as Lucy Coe on the long-running soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; which she has played on and off since 1986.

==Early life==
Herring was born in Enid, Oklahoma. Before acting, Herring was Miss Virginia USA 1977, and was 4th runner-up to Kimberly Tomes for the title of Miss USA 1977. She earned a B.A. in psychology from Louisiana State University, where she was also a member of Delta Delta Delta sorority.

==Acting career==
Herring is best known for her work in daytime television, first portraying the role of mousy librarian Lucy Coe on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1986. Over time, Lucy became much more glamorous and man-hungry, and the role proved to be very lucrative for Herring. She left after six years to explore other opportunities, which led to a role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Her character, Lisanne Gardner, was never fully developed, and Herring asked to be let out of her contract with the show. &quot;Days&quot; producers agreed, and she then returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

She played Lucy on &quot;General Hospital&quot; until 1997, when she was asked to reprise her character on a spin-off series called &quot;Port Charles&quot;. She appeared on the series until it was canceled in 2003, and subsequently made a brief return to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 2004.

She joined the cast of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; on July 24, 2009, as Audrey Coleman.

On November 2, 2012, after more than eight years off-screen, it was announced that Herring would return to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Lucy in December. She first aired on December 17.

==Personal life==
Herring was married to actor Wayne Northrop from May 1981 until his death in 2024. They had two sons: Hank Wayne, born on January 9, 1991, and Grady Lee, born on July 20, 1993, in Los Angeles. They owned and ran a working cattle ranch in the Madera County area of Raymond.

In a February 2007 interview, Herring&#x27;s former co-star Kin Shriner said of Herring: &quot;She&#x27;s living a life that most women would love. She&#x27;s going to restore an old train depot on land up where she lives and bring it back to a sort of museum quality. She&#x27;s lobbying. She&#x27;s back at school. She&#x27;s working with animals. She&#x27;s got her two boys. She&#x27;s like Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. She&#x27;s running the whole town.&quot;

<doc id="892957" wikidata="Q4230857" url="?curid=892957" title="Concatenative programming language">
<text>A concatenative programming language is a point-free computer programming language in which all expressions denote functions, and the juxtaposition of expressions denotes function composition. Concatenative programming replaces function application, which is common in other programming styles, with function composition as the default way to build subroutines.

==Example==
For example, a nesting of operations in an applicative language like the following:
baz(bar(foo(x)))
...is written in a concatenative language as a sequence of functions:

 x foo bar baz

Functions and procedures written in concatenative style are not value level, i.e. they typically do not represent the data structures they operate on with explicit names or identifiers. Instead they are function levela function is defined as a pipeline, or a sequence of operations that take parameters from an implicit data structure upon which all functions operate, and return the function results to that shared structure so that it will be used by the next operator.

The combination of compositional semantics with a syntax that mirrors such a semantic makes concatenative languages highly amenable to algebraic manipulation of programs; although it may be difficult to write mathematical expressions directly in them. Concatenative languages can be implemented efficiently with a stack machine, and are commonly present implicitly in virtual machines in the form of their instruction sets.

==Properties==
The properties of concatenative languages are the result of their compositional syntax and semantics:

* The reduction of any expression is the simplification of one function to another function; it is never necessary to deal with the application of functions to objects.
* Any subexpression can be replaced with a name that represents the same subexpression. This is referred to in the concatenative community as factoring and is used extensively to simplify programs into smaller parts.
* The syntax and semantics of concatenative languages form the algebraic structure of a monoid.
* Concatenative languages can be made well-suited to an implementation inspired by linear logic where no garbage is ever generated.

==Implementations==
The first concatenative programming language was Forth, although Joy was the first language to call itself concatenative. Other concatenative languages are dc, Factor, Onyx, PostScript, and RPL.

Most existing concatenative languages are stack-based; this is not a requirement and other models have been proposed. Concatenative languages are currently used for embedded, desktop, and web programming, as target languages, and for research purposes.

Most concatenative languages are dynamically typed. Exceptions include the statically typed Cat language.

<text>Victoria (, meaning &quot;the city Victoria&quot;), also known among the native Maltese as Rabat (which is the name of the old town centre) or by its title Città Victoria, is an administrative unit of Malta, and the main town on Gozo. Victoria has a total population of 6,901 (as of March 2014), and is the most populous settlement in Gozo.

The area around the town, situated on a hill near the centre of the island, has been settled since Neolithic times. Victoria is the name given on 10 June 1887 by the British government on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, at the request of Pietro Monsignor Pace, Bishop of Gozo (Monsignor Pace later became Sir Pietro Monsignor Pace, Titular Archbishop of Rhodes and Bishop of Malta). However, many Gozitans, mainly older Gozitans, still often refer to it by the name Rabat. It is usually known as Rabat, Gozo to distinguish it from the town of Rabat on the main island of Malta.

===Cittadella===

In the heart of Victoria lies the Cittadella (Citadel), formerly known as &quot;il Castello&quot;, which has been the centre of activity of the island since possibly Neolithic times, but is known to be first fortified during the Bronze Age c. 1500 BC. It was later developed by the Phoenicians and continued into becoming a complex Acropolis by Roman times.

The north side of the Citadel dates back to the Aragonese domination period. The south flank, overlooking Victoria, was re-constructed under the Knights of St. John, namely between 1599 and 1603, after Ottomans invaded the city in 1551. The massive defensive stone walls of the fortifications rise above the town and were built by the Knights to protect the village communities from foraging corsairs attempting to take slaves and threatened invasion of Moslem forces fighting Christendom.

Within its walls lies a fine 17th century baroque Cathedral designed by Lorenzo Gafà, the Maltese architect who also built the Cathedral of Mdina. It is said that it lies on the site where a Roman temple dedicated to Juno once stood. It is most famous for the remarkable &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting on its ceiling, which depicts the interior of a dome that was never built. The Cathedral is built on one of the oldest religious sites in Gozo, if not the oldest, with evidence of some sort of temple dedicated to a goddess or female figure long before the Romans.

The Cathedral also houses a beautiful statue of the Assumption of Mary, donated to the Cathedral by the Leone Philharmonic Society (1863). The statue was originally bought by the band from Rome from the Fabbrica di Statue Religiose of Francesco Rosa in 1897, when the band had its first disagreement with its first &#x27;daughter-band&#x27; the La Stella Philharmonic Society (1880), and the Leone Band took control of the feast of the Assumption of Mary, and the La Stella Band took control of the feast of St. George. The statue was then donated to the Cathedral on the 29th of April, 1956 after many other disagreements between the bands.


===St George&#x27;s Parish===
St. George&#x27;s Basilica, Malta, caters for half of the population of Victoria, as it is a personal parish (as opposed to other parishes who are territorial) operating in the city of Victoria. Its parish church, dedicated to St George, has the status of a Basilica. This church was built in the 1670s and suffered severe damage in the earthquake of 1693. A new façade was built in 1818. The dome and the aisles are of recent construction (1930s and 1940s). There are several works of art in this church which include the painting of the dome and ceiling by Gian Battista Conti of Rome and other paintings and sculptures by Mattia Preti, Giuseppe d&#x27;Arena, Stefano Erardi, Alessio Erardi, Francesco V. Zahra, Giuseppe Calì, and contemporary Alfred Camilleri Cauchi and John L. Grima. The titular statue of St George was carved from solid wood by Pietro Paolo Azzopardi in 1838 and is the first titular statue on the island. The area over which the church is built is of considerable archaeological interest.

The parish celebrates two feasts during the year: 23 April, the official date celebrating the death of the martyr, and the third Sunday of July, when the solemn festivities in honour of Gozo&#x27;s patron saint are held.

In February 2013, the Basilica opened the doors to its new modern museum, one of a kind in the country. It is the first building built for the purpose of a museum. The Museum and cultural centre, named as Heart of Gozo: Il-Hagar, displays a rich collection of historical and artistic artefacts previously inaccessible to the general public. The museum is found on the left side of the Basilica.

===Villa Rundle Gardens===

These gardens are situated between Republic Street and the Main Car Park in Victoria. One can see in these gardens a bronze bust of the Gozitan 18th-century historian and grammarian Canon Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis and another of Gozo born French poet and writer Laurent Ropa. One can also find a memorial commemorating the invasion of Gozo by Ottomans in 1551.

<text>The Kröller-Müller Museum () is a national art museum and sculpture garden, located in the Hoge Veluwe National Park in Otterlo in the Netherlands. The museum, founded by art collector Helene Kröller-Müller within the extensive grounds of her and her husband&#x27;s former estate (now the national park), opened in 1938. It has the second-largest collection of paintings by Vincent van Gogh, after the Van Gogh Museum. The museum had 380,000 visitors in 2015.

== History ==
The Kröller-Müller Museum was founded by Helene Kröller-Müller, an avid art collector who, being advised by H.P. Bremmer, was one of the first to recognize Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s genius and collect his works. In 1935, she donated her whole collection to the state of the Netherlands. In 1938, the museum, which was designed by Henry van de Velde, opened to the public. The sculpture garden was added in 1961 and the new exhibition wing, designed by Wim Quist, opened in 1977.

== Collection ==

The museum has a considerable collection of paintings by Vincent van Gogh, such as &quot;Café Terrace at Night&quot;, and &quot;Sorrowing Old Man (At Eternity&#x27;s Gate)&quot;. Making it the second-largest collection of Van Gogh paintings in the world (after the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam). Apart from the Van Gogh paintings, other highlights include works by Piet Mondrian, Georges-Pierre Seurat, Odilon Redon, Georges Braque, Paul Gauguin, Lucas Cranach, James Ensor, Juan Gris, William Degouve de Nuncques and Pablo Picasso.

== Sculpture garden ==
The Kröller-Müller Museum is also famous for its large sculpture garden, within the forest park, of more than and one of the largest in Europe, with a fine collection of modern and contemporary sculptures. The garden reflects Helene Kröller-Müller&#x27;s conception of a symbiosis between art, architecture and nature. The collection includes works by Auguste Rodin, Henry Moore, Jean Dubuffet, Mark di Suvero, Lucio Fontana, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, Fritz Wotruba, Joep van Lieshout and many more.

==Selected collection highlights==

== Administration ==
Lisette Pelsers was the museum director of the Kröller-Müller Museum from 2012 to 2024. She was succeeded by Benno Tempel.

The museum had an increasing number of visitors until the COVID-19 pandemic, when it took a severe plunge due to closures and reduced tourism activities overall. Visitor numbers have largely recovered since, but have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels.

The museum was the 12th most visited museum nationally in 2013.

<doc id="892980" wikidata="Q6900699" url="?curid=892980" title="Monkey (character)">
<text>Monkey (also known as The Monkey, ITV Digital Monkey or PG Tips Monkey, and often pronounced in imitation of Johnny Vegas&#x27; Lancashire accent), is a puppet advertising character in the form of a knitted sock monkey. He was first produced by The Jim Henson Company via their UK Creature Shop, puppeteered by Nigel Plaskitt and Susan Beattie and voiced by comedian Ben Miller.

Monkey has appeared in advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom for both the defunct television company ITV Digital and the tea brand PG Tips, as well as being occasionally featured in TV programmes. Monkey&#x27;s first appearance was 11 July 2001, featuring in ITV Digital. Monkey is notable as one of a small number of advertising characters to eclipse the popularity of the product they advertise and also to be reused to advertise a completely different product. In May 2024, Monkey was officially retired from PG Tips advertisements.

==ITV Digital==
A series of high-profile adverts for ITV Digital featured the laid-back, droll and composed Monkey (in a variety of T-shirts) playing the straight man to the comedian Johnny Vegas&#x27;s womaniser of a character &quot;Al&quot;. Monkey was one of the few positive public relations successes of ITV Digital. Purchasers of ITV Digital were sent a free soft toy Monkey with their subscription.

For a period during the advertising campaign and after ITV Digital&#x27;s bankruptcy, the original promotional Monkey toys were in high demand and short supply. One sold for £150 at the bankruptcy auction and they were selling for several hundred pounds on eBay, where customers could also find replica Monkey knitting patterns delivered by email selling for several pounds. Later, The Gadget Shop purchased the remaining promotional toys from ITV Digital&#x27;s liquidators and sold them through their retail stores. These saw a boost in popularity after an appearance in the second series of award-winning British sitcom The Office.

==Legal dispute==
As Monkey was created and owned by advertising agency Mother rather than by ITV Digital itself, he was the subject of a legal dispute as both claimed the rights to the character. This prevented his use for some time, despite many organisations being keen to acquire the rights. The dispute was eventually resolved by both parties agreeing to donate the intellectual property rights for Monkey to Comic Relief. Following the resolution of the dispute, Monkey appeared in a few TV shows, with the BBC using him for 2001&#x27;s Comic Relief. He was about to make a guest appearance at the 2002 BRIT Awards but was later pulled out due to restrictions. In both cases Monkey appeared without Johnny Vegas. In 2003, the BBC commissioned a variety show to be hosted by Monkey. A pilot was filmed titled &quot;Watch with Monkey&quot; and featured Dawn French and the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain. The pilot has never been televised.

==PG Tips==

In January 2007, Monkey and Vegas reprised their double act in a new series of advertisements for PG Tips tea. The first advertisement was named &quot;The Return&quot; and the adverts make reference to PG Tips&#x27; popular series of adverts featuring live chimps which ran between 1956 and 2002, as well as to ITV Digital going out of business (on which low audience figures, piracy issues and an ultimately unaffordable multi-million pound deal with the Football League led to the broadcaster suffering massive losses, forcing it to enter administration in March 2002).

PG launched a website selling the newly branded &quot;PG Monkey&quot; merchandise with profits being donated to Comic Relief, who still own the intellectual property rights. The online shop has since closed but during promotions PG Tips have given away free mini-Monkeys packaged with their tea.

On May 1, 2024, PG Tips officially retired the Monkey character, stating that he was having a &quot;well-deserved retirement&quot;.

===Mini movie===
Monkey also appeared in a short advertising film which was shown in cinemas at the beginning of selected showings of &quot;Horton Hears a Who&quot;, &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Hannah Montana 3D&quot; and &quot;The Game Plan&quot;. The film was released on 21 March 2008. The film is called &quot;A Tale of Two Continents&quot; and has Monkey portraying various historical figures as he attempts to make the perfect cup of tea in the Kenya tea farms and then safely take it across the world to England for The Queen. The film was also given away on DVD with special packs of PG Tips tea.

==Characteristics==

===Early life===
In &quot;Monkey - Hero of Our Time&quot;, Monkey writes that his &quot;parents owned a toy shop&quot;; however, this was forced into closure in &#x27;1982&#x27;. He said &quot;[a]s my parents were clearing away and throwing out what was left of the stock, my mother came across me, stuck behind a pile of empty cardboard boxes&quot; and &quot;[s]he took me home and painstakingly restored me back to my former glory - cleaning me, re-stuffing me and sewing me up. Her love for me was so great that I amazingly found myself able to move and speak.&quot; Soon afterwards he claimed that his first words to her were &quot;Put the kettle on, eh Mum? I&#x27;m parched.&quot;.

===Personality and habits===
Monkey is sometimes portrayed as being quite cowardly; for example his refusal to take responsibility for dropping a ceramic bowl dating back to 3000 BC, despite being filmed doing so. He is also prone to miserliness, having admitted that he re-uses discarded plasters he finds in swimming pools. Monkey hoards both his and Al&#x27;s wages, deliberately neglecting to inform the naive Al of the fact that they are in fact paid for their work, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t bother Al with details&quot; and that his money is &quot;safely invested in a portfolio of bananas&quot;. Despite his turbulent relationship with Al, the two share the same bed.
Monkey is shown to be very passionate about tea, his favourite serving method being &quot;three stirs clockwise, two stirs back, one and three quarters sugars&quot;. He vehemently insists that tea bags should precede milk when brewing.
His exact species is never clarified; Monkey himself denies being a chimpanzee (the CHimp logo on his tea-shirt puns on CH sounding like the Chinese word for tea), and his response to Al&#x27;s idea that he may be &quot;half monkey-half chimp&quot; is limited to &quot;speak for yourself&quot;. Though he claims to be a &quot;ladies&#x27; monkey&quot;, he is caught by Al surfing dating sites, giving exaggerated descriptions of his physical appearance.
He is sometimes shown wearing a woman&#x27;s nightcap, a sheath dress and a ballet tutu. He gets distressed if tea is made in the wrong order.

=== Monkey&#x27;s cult following ===
When the ITV Digital ads came out Monkey was instantly famous and ITV Digital put Plushies in the package for the box.

<doc id="893001" wikidata="Q896513" url="?curid=893001" title="Hamburger Schule">
<text>The Hamburger Schule (German for &#x27;Hamburg School&#x27;) is a music movement current in Germany during the 1980s and early 1990s. With some active bands and artists it is still present. It took up traditions of Neue Deutsche Welle and combined them with elements of indie rock, punk, grunge, experimental pop, and intellectual lyrics. It established new grounds for the use of German language in pop music.

== Introduction ==
As the name indicates, the movement was initially carried by Hamburg based bands like , Kolossale Jugend, Ostzonensuppenwürfelmachenkrebs, Die Erde, Blumfeld, Tocotronic, Die Sterne, , and Die Goldenen Zitronen. Their music didn&#x27;t necessarily sound similar, but was characterised by lyrics in German language (not a given in Germany) that gave voice to social criticism and were based on post-modern theory. Consequently, it was lauded by the leftist trade press (especially &quot;Spex&quot; magazine). The artists themselves didn&#x27;t initially perceive these similarities to be particularly important and denied the existence of a homogeneous movement. However, social links and political cooperations suggest that it wasn&#x27;t unreasonable to view it as that. Furthermore, it could be surmised that the term &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; is a pun on the so-called &quot;Frankfurter Schule&quot; (&#x27;Frankfurt School&#x27;) which is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research, and philosophy, centered at the Institute for Social Research (&quot;Institut für Sozialforschung&quot;) of the University of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. However, it seems more likely to be simply a clever knock at the need for legitimacy, by referencing the way all art movements are titled in German (e.g. &quot;Wiener Schule&quot;, &quot;Berliner Schule&quot;, &quot;Österreichische Schule&quot;, &quot;New Yorker Schule&quot;, etc.).

== Beginnings ==
In the late 1980s, a new musical scene was emerging in Hamburg comprising a number of bands that sung in German but that had no record deals (with the exception of Die Antwort). To remedy this situation and to give the new style a platform, the record label L&#x27;Age D&#x27;Or was established in October 1988 by Carol von Rautenkranz and Pascal Fuhlbrügge. They signed contracts with many bands and published numerous albums. Many of the albums were produced by Chris von Rautenkranz, Carol&#x27;s brother, in the Soundgarden recording studio in Hamburg. Another label that influenced the emerging genre was Alfred Hilsberg&#x27;s What&#x27;s So Funny About?, which published the first albums by Blumfeld, , and Die Erde.

Another significant representative of &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; was Andreas Mand.

Soon, however, the &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; was not restricted to Hamburg anymore. In particular, a local scene of germanophone bands had developed in the small town of Bad Salzuflen in Eastern Westphalia, which was centered on the label Fast Weltweit. Founders were Frank Werner, Frank Spilker (of the band Die Sterne), Michael Girke, Bernadette La Hengst (of Die Braut haut ins Auge) and Jochen Distelmeyer (then of Bienenjäger, later Blumfeld). They got in contact with the Hamburg scene through Bernd Begemann who was a native of Bad Salzuflen but moved to Hamburg where he established his band Die Antwort. This led to various gigs in Hamburg for bands from the Fast Weltweit label, eventually causing many other artists to move to Hamburg.

Another first-generation &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; band, Die Regierung, was based in Hamburg for a long time, but originated from Essen.

== Rise and fall ==
By the mid 1990s, three bands met with great commercial success: Blumfeld, Die Sterne, and Tocotronic. The &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; became known as the epitome of German indie pop music. When other German guitar bands, whose music and lyrics were of a different style, they were able to profit from this success while spurring an entirely new indie pop scene. The &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; began to be marginalised by a movement which it had helped to create.

Other artists that are considered part of the &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; are Milch, Rocko Schamoni and the &#x27;Mobylettes&#x27;. But as time went by, the term eventually encompassed such a broad spectrum of musical content that it could hardly be associated with a particular musical genre anymore. As several bands have started to sing in foreign languages, it has begun to lose any meaning it once had.

== Revival ==
By the end of the 1990s, there emerged a new wave of German guitar music with intellectual aspirations. Examples for this new generation of artists, who clearly tie in with the &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; tradition, are Spillsbury, Kettcar, Erdmöbel, Kajak, Justin Balk, , Astra Kid, Modus Noa, Marr and Tomte. They display a new musical homogeneity of punk-influenced guitar pop.

Several small labels have sprung up to support this new musical current. Arguably the most important one is the Hamburg-based label Grand Hotel van Cleef which, like L&#x27;Age D&#x27;Or seeks to be an enabler for local bands. It was established in September 2002 by Tomte&#x27;s Thees Uhlmann and Kettcar&#x27;s Marcus Wiebusch and Reimer Bustorff.

== List of Hamburger Schule bands and solo artists ==
This list includes music groups and solo artists from the &quot;Hamburger Schule&quot; and its surroundings. The chronological focus is mainly between the end of the 1980s and the mid-1990s. It also includes bands and solo musicians, who were active before the emergence of the music movement in the 1980s and are regarded as its pioneers (e.g. &quot;Kolossale Jugend or Cpt. Kirk &amp;.&quot;) and forerunners (e.g. Die Goldenen Zitronen).

<doc id="893014" wikidata="Q252609" url="?curid=893014" title="New Swabia">
<text>New Swabia (Norwegian and ) was an area of Antarctica explored, with the intention to claim it, by Nazi Germany between 1938 and 1939, within the Norwegian territorial claim of Queen Maud Land . The region was named after the expedition&#x27;s ship, , itself named after the German region of Swabia. Although the name &quot;New Swabia&quot; is occasionally mentioned in historical contexts, it is not an officially recognized cartographic name in modern use. The area is now part of Queen Maud Land, governed under the Antarctic Treaty System.

==Background==
Like many other countries, Germany sent expeditions to the Antarctic region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of which were scientific. The late 19th century expeditions to the Southern Ocean, South Georgia, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Crozet Islands were astronomical, meteorological, and hydrological, mostly in close collaboration with scientific teams from other countries. As the 19th century ended, Germany began to focus on Antarctica.

The first German expedition to Antarctica was the Gauss expedition from 1901 to 1903. Led by Arctic veteran and geology professor Erich von Drygalski, this was the second expedition to use a hot-air balloon in Antarctica. It also found and named Kaiser Wilhelm II Land. The second German Antarctic expedition (1911–1912) was led by Wilhelm Filchner with a goal of crossing Antarctica to learn if it was one piece of land. As happened with other such early attempts, the crossing failed before it even began. The expedition discovered and named the Luitpold Coast and the Filchner Ice Shelf. A German whaling fleet was put to sea in 1937 and, upon its successful return in early 1938, plans for a third German Antarctic expedition were drawn up.

==German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939)==
The third German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939) was led by Alfred Ritscher (1879–1963), a captain in the German Navy. The main purpose was to find an area in Antarctica for a German whaling station, as a way to increase Germany&#x27;s production of fat. Whale oil was then the most important raw material for the production of margarine and soap in Germany and the country was the second largest purchaser of Norwegian whale oil, importing some 200,000 metric tonnes annually. Besides the disadvantage of being dependent on imports, it was thought that Germany would soon be at war, which was considered to put too much strain on Germany&#x27;s foreign currency reserves. Another goal was to scout possible locations for a German naval base.

On 17 December 1938, the New Swabia Expedition left Hamburg for Antarctica aboard MS &quot;Schwabenland&quot; (a freighter built in 1925 and renamed in 1934 after the Swabia region in southern Germany) which could also carry and catapult aircraft. The secret expedition had 33 members plus &quot;Schwabenland&quot;″s crew of 24. On 19 January 1939, the ship arrived at the Princess Martha Coast, in an area which had lately been claimed by Norway as Queen Maud Land, and began charting the region. Nazi German flags were placed on the sea ice along the coast. Naming the area &quot;Neu-Schwabenland&quot; after the ship, the expedition established a temporary base and in the following weeks teams walked along the coast recording claim reservations on hills and other significant landmarks. Seven photographic survey flights were made by the ship&#x27;s two Dornier Wal seaplanes named &quot;Passat&quot; and &quot;Boreas&quot;. About a dozen -long aluminum arrows, with steel cones and three upper stabilizer wings embossed with swastikas, were airdropped onto the ice at turning points of the flight polygons (these arrows had been tested on the Pasterze glacier in Austria before the expedition). None of these have ever been recovered. Eight more flights were made to areas of keen interest and on these trips, some of the photos were taken with colour film. Altogether they flew over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers and took more than 16,000 aerial photographs, some of which were published after the war by Ritscher. The ice-free Schirmacher Oasis, which now hosts the Maitri and Novolazarevskaya research stations, was spotted from the air by Richard Heinrich Schirmacher (who named it after himself) shortly before the &quot;Schwabenland&quot; left the Antarctic coast on 6 February 1939.
On its return trip to Germany, the expedition made oceanographic studies near Bouvet Island and Fernando de Noronha, arriving back in Hamburg on 11 April 1939. Meanwhile, the Norwegian government had learned about the expedition through reports from whalers along the coast of Queen Maud Land. 

Shortly after the expedition&#x27;s return, World War II broke out in Europe, with Germany occupying Norway in April of 1940. This occupation technically extended to the Norwegian Antarctic Dependencies, nearby to New Swabia. Additionally, the fall of France to Germany later that year also technically brought the French Antarctic territory of Adélie Land under German influence. However, no attempt at controlling or incorporating these territories were made, and any German territory in Antarctica was relinquished following the defeat of Germany in May 1945. 

Germany never advanced any territorial claims to the region, which were abandoned in 1945.

==Geographic features mapped by the expedition==
Because the area was first explored by a German expedition, the name &quot;Neuschwabenland&quot; (&quot;New Swabia&quot;) is still used for the region on some maps, as are many of the German names given to its geographic features. Some geographic features mapped by the expedition were not named until the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) (1949–1952), led by John Schjelderup Giæver. Others were not named until they were remapped from aerial photographs taken by the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition (1958–1959).

The exact location of objects in italics could not yet be determined because the position was given too imprecisely in the expedition report due to navigation problems with the aircraft, and most of the aerial photographs that would have allowed identification were lost during World War II. The names of objects that could be clearly located were used in the Norwegian translation of the topographical map &quot;Dronning Maud Land 1:250,000&quot; published by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1966.


===Aftermath===
Germany made no formal territorial claims to New Swabia. No whaling station or other lasting bases were built there by Germany, and no permanent presence was established until the Georg von Neumayer Station, a research facility, was opened in 1981. Germany&#x27;s current Neumayer Station III is also located in the region.

Although New Swabia is occasionally mentioned in historical contexts, it is not an officially recognized cartographic designation today. The region is part of Queen Maud Land, administered by Norway as a dependent territory under the Antarctic Treaty System, and overseen by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police.

== Conspiracy theories ==
Neuschwabenland has been the subject of conspiracy theories for decades, some of them related to Nazi UFO claims. Most assert that, in the wake of the German expedition of 1938–39, a huge military base was built there. After the war, high-ranking Nazis, scientists, and elite military units are claimed to have survived there. The US and UK have supposedly been trying to conquer the area for decades, and to have used nuclear weapons in this effort. Proponents claim the base is sustained by hot springs providing energy and warmth.

The WDR radio play &quot;Neuschwabenland-Symphonie&quot; from 2012 takes up the conspiracy theories.

<doc id="893021" wikidata="Q2723752" url="?curid=893021" title="Indian nationality law">
<text>Indian nationality law details the conditions by which a person holds Indian nationality. The two primary pieces of legislation governing these requirements are the Constitution of the Republic of India and the Citizenship Act, 1955.

All persons born in India between 26 January 1950 and 1 July 1987 automatically received citizenship by birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Between 1 July 1987 and 3 December 2004, citizenship by birth was granted if at least one parent was a citizen. Individuals born in the country since then receive Indian citizenship at birth only if both parents are Indian citizens, or if one parent is a citizen and the other is not considered an illegal migrant.

Foreigners may become Indian citizens by naturalisation after residing in the country for at least 12 years and renouncing any previous nationalities. Members of certain religious minority communities from neighbouring countries qualify for a reduced residence requirement of six years. Indian citizens who permanently settle in Pakistan or Bangladesh, or voluntarily acquire foreign citizenship automatically lose Indian citizenship. Dual citizenship is allowed in certain cases of minor children. 

India was previously ruled by the British Empire and local residents were British subjects and British protected persons. Although India gained independence in 1947 and Indians no longer hold British nationality, they continue to have favoured status when residing in the United Kingdom; as Commonwealth citizens, Indians are eligible to vote in UK elections and serve in public office there. Indian citizens also enjoy free movement rights in Nepal through bilateral agreement.

== Terminology ==
The distinction between the meaning of the terms citizenship and nationality is not always clear in the English language and differs by country. Generally, nationality refers a person&#x27;s legal belonging to a nation state and is the common term used in international treaties when referring to members of a state; citizenship refers to the set of rights and duties a person has in that nation.

In general discourse within the Indian context, the two terms are used interchangeably. However, the Supreme Court provides a more precise definition applicable in Indian law; citizenship is a legal status that can only be held by natural persons and determines the civil and political rights a person may exercise, while nationality is a status that can apply to both natural and juridical persons that determines the rights that entity has in the context of international law.

== Colonial-era history ==
=== Company administration ===
The East India Company was founded by royal charter in 1600 and granted a monopoly on all English trade with Asia. Over the course of the 17th century, the company secured a strong commercial presence in the Indian subcontinent through trade in indigo dye, saltpeter, and Indian textiles. Operations became more lucrative as the Mughal Empire entered into decline in the 18th century, giving the company opportunity to gain further advantages by intervening in regional politics. The vast financial resources of the firm and its superior military enabled it to defeat rival European trade companies and become the dominant power in India. The company itself ruled as the direct governing body from 1757 to 1858, though sovereignty was often shared with the Crown. Although legislation was enacted referencing British subjects in India, no comprehensive nationality statute existed to define which persons were subjects, leaving the status of native Indians ambiguous throughout this period.

Legislation passed in 1852 allowed foreigners residing in territory governed by the East India Company to naturalise as British subjects by application to the government. There was no minimum residence requirement and candidates simply needed approval from a relevant official. The oath of allegiance administered to successful applicants required them to swear loyal service to the company, as well as allegiance to the British monarch.

=== Direct imperial rule ===
India was brought under direct rule of the British Empire in 1858. Territories were broadly divided between two political groupings: the provinces of British India, which were administered by the British government, and the princely states, which were areas ruled by local monarchs given limited autonomy in exchange for accepting British suzerainty. Provincial residents were British subjects, while subjects of princely state rulers were considered British protected persons instead.

Although Britain held comprehensive jurisdiction in both types of holdings, domestic law treated the princely states as foreign territory. British protected persons were treated as aliens in the United Kingdom, but both Indian British subjects and protected persons could be issued British Indian passports. Protected persons could not travel to the UK without first requesting permission, but were afforded the same consular protection as British subjects when travelling outside of the Empire. A person with connections both to directly governed portions of British India and one of the princely states could be a British subject and British protected person simultaneously.

British nationality law during this time was uncodified and did not have a standard set of regulations, relying instead on past precedent and common law. Until the mid-19th century, it was unclear whether naturalisation rules in the United Kingdom were applicable in other parts of the Empire. Each colony had wide discretion in developing their own procedures and requirements for admitting foreigners as subjects. Naturalisation in Britain was achieved through individual Acts of Parliament until 1844, when a more streamlined administrative process was introduced. In 1847, the Imperial Parliament formalised a clear distinction between subjects who were naturalised in the UK and those who did so in other territories. Individuals who were naturalised in the UK were deemed to have received the status by imperial naturalisation, which was valid throughout the Empire. Those naturalised in colonies were said to have gone through local naturalisation and were given subject status valid only within the relevant territory. For example, a subject locally naturalised in Bengal was a British subject there, but not in England nor New South Wales. Like protected persons, locally naturalised British subjects were still entitled to imperial protection when travelling outside of the Empire.

The Imperial Parliament brought regulations for British subject status into codified statute law for the first time with passage of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5. c. 17). British subject status was standardised as a common nationality across the Empire. This act allowed Dominions and British India to grant subject status to aliens by imperial naturalisation, but did not prevent further grants of local naturalisation under local legislation. The continued application of local naturalisation allowed British Indian authorities to avoid adding English language requirements to the naturalisation process.

==== Unequal status ====
Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Queen Victoria issued a royal proclamation to the &quot;Princes, Chiefs and People of India&quot; in 1858, declaring the Crown to be &quot;bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to all our other subjects&quot;. Official rhetoric emphasised British subject status as a platform of equity, illustrating an imperial philosophy that all subjects of the Crown were equal before the law, regardless of race or background.

This ideal was directly contradicted by a series of immigration restrictions in other colonies and Dominions that were created to exclude non-white migrants, including Indian British subjects, from entering their borders. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa all enacted legislation severely restricting Indian immigration in some form by the early 20th century. Indians had greater success exercising their British subject rights in Britain itself, exemplified by the election of two Indian candidates to the House of Commons, Dadabhai Naoroji and Mancherjee Bhownaggree.

Demands for an equal imperial citizenship with the same status and rights as European British subjects were a primary motivator for Indian civil rights movements throughout the Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While the imperial government had recognised these claims as legitimate prior to the First World War, it was nervous at the prospect of these movements becoming revolutionary in nature and decided to forcefully suppress local unrest rather than politically address Indian concerns. As it became apparent that equality within the British Empire would not be possible, the focus of post-war Indian political movements turned towards independence.

== Post-independence policies ==
=== Partition and transition ===
British India was partitioned into two independent Dominions on 15 August 1947, the Union of India and Federation of Pakistan. India transitionally retained the British sovereign as its head of state until its continued membership in the Commonwealth of Nations as a republic was agreed upon at the 1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference. Indians continued to be British subjects until independent India enacted its own nationality legislation. Subjects of the princely states, who were previously considered British protected persons, became British subjects of India when their states acceded to India.

British subject status was reformed under the British Nationality Act 1948. The Act abandoned the common nationality used across the Empire and redefined British subject to mean any citizen of a Commonwealth country. A Commonwealth citizen was defined in this Act to have the same meaning. British subject/Commonwealth citizen status co-existed with the citizenship of each Commonwealth country. Because India had not enacted citizenship regulations by the time the 1948 Act took effect on 1 January 1949, Indians (and citizens of all other Dominions without citizenship laws) were provisionally classed as &quot;British subjects without citizenship&quot;.

=== Republic and a national citizenship ===
The citizenship provisions of the Constitution of India came into force on 26 November 1949, in advance of the document&#x27;s full effective date and the country&#x27;s conversion into a republic on 26 January 1950. The partition resulted in large-scale population movements across the new borders separating India and Pakistan. In this context, the Constituent Assembly limited the scope of the Constitution&#x27;s citizenship provisions for the immediate purpose of determining citizenship of these migrants. The Citizenship Act later enacted by Parliament in 1955 provides a full framework detailing citizenship requirements after that point.

Any individual domiciled in India automatically became an Indian citizen in 1949 if they were: born in India, born to at least one parent who themself was born in India, or living in India for at least five years prior to the Constitution&#x27;s commencement. Individuals of Indian descent living outside of the country could register for citizenship, but a person who had voluntarily acquired citizenship of a foreign state was barred from Indian citizenship. In this context, the definition of &quot;foreign state&quot; does not include Commonwealth member states.

Persons who migrated from the area that became part of Pakistan could be registered as Indian citizens if they (or a parent or grandparent) were born in any part of pre-partition India as defined by the Government of India Act 1935 and had either become domiciled in Indian territory before 19 July 1948, or had been registered as a citizen of India by Dominion officials after that date, but before commencement of the Constitution. Migrants from Pakistan were required to have been domiciled in India for at least six months prior to applying for registration. Conversely, persons who migrated from India to Pakistan and settled there at any time are not considered Indian citizens.

Migration between Nepal and India has been unrestricted since before a clear boundary existed between the two countries. While the British Indian government had encouraged Nepalese to settle in northeastern India to facilitate the growth of tea plantations in that area, high levels of migration between the two countries continued to occur due to cultural and religious similarities. Following Indian independence, the government negotiated a free movement agreement with Nepal that resulted in the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship; all Indian and Nepalese citizens have since had the officially sanctioned ability to live and work in either country.

==== Commonwealth citizenship ====

Commonwealth citizens initially continued to hold an automatic right to settle in the United Kingdom and Ireland after 1949. Non-white immigration into the UK was systemically discouraged, but strong economic conditions in Britain following the Second World War attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration. In response, the British Parliament imposed immigration controls on any Commonwealth citizens originating from outside the British Islands with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. Ireland had continued to allow all British subjects free movement despite independence in 1922 as part of the Common Travel Area arrangement, but moved to mirror Britain&#x27;s restriction in 1962 by limiting this ability only to people born on the islands of Great Britain or Ireland. Britain somewhat relaxed these measures in 1971 for patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom, which gave effective preferential treatment to white Commonwealth citizens.

Under the 1955 Citizenship Act, Commonwealth citizens were eligible to obtain Indian citizenship by registration in lieu of naturalisation, though there were no specific advantages to this method of acquisition. This pathway was available until Commonwealth citizen status was removed from Indian law in 2003. The UK itself updated its nationality law to reflect the more modest boundaries of its remaining territory and overseas possessions with the British Nationality Act 1981, which redefined the term &quot;British subject&quot; to no longer also include Commonwealth citizens. Indian citizens remain Commonwealth citizens in British law and are still eligible to vote and stand for public office in the UK.

==== Integration of remaining colonies ====
Remaining European colonial possessions in India were reintegrated by 1961. French-administered Chandernagore held a referendum in 1949 resulting in the city&#x27;s merger with West Bengal, while the rest of French India was relinquished by 1954. Portuguese India was taken by force with two military offensives in 1954 and 1961. Although most residents of these territories were given a choice between acquiring Indian citizenship and retaining their previous nationalities, those from Dadra and Nagar Haveli were not. In Goa, Daman and Diu, residents automatically became Indian citizens on 20 December 1961 unless they had made a written declaration before this date stating their intention to retain their existing nationality. Portugal did not recognise the annexation of its former Indian territories; persons born in applicable areas before 3 June 1975 were recognized as Portuguese citizens.

==== Accession of Sikkim ====
The Kingdom of Sikkim was an autonomous monarchy in northeastern India from the 17th century to 1975. Although Britain (and later India) had control over its foreign affairs, Sikkim was never considered a princely state and always held full autonomy over domestic matters. Sikkim lacked codified nationality legislation until 1961, when the Sikkim Subject Regulation came into force. This legislation initially defined Sikkim subjects as anyone of native ancestry with their permanent home in the country, or a person permanently settled in Sikkim who had cut all ties with their previous country or had acquired real estate in Sikkim. Subject status was further restricted by a requirement to have held property rights in Sikkim before 1937, effectively barring a large number of Nepali residents from obtaining a permanent status in the country. Dual citizenship was prohibited and women automatically lost their rights as subjects on their marriage to non-Sikkimese men.

The ethnic qualification to subject status was particularly unpopular, leading to a revolt and the repeal of the regulation in the following year. However, the 1962 amendment also created a facilitated naturalisation pathway for non-subjects of native ancestry; any person descended from a person domiciled in Sikkim before 1850 could apply for subject status even if they did not live in the country.

After the dissolution of Sikkim&#x27;s monarchy and its accession to India in 1975, any person registered as a Sikkimese subject before 26 April 1975 became an Indian citizen. This process of acquisition left certain groups of people living in Sikkim stateless including long-term residents without property, Sikkimese women who married non-Sikkimese, and individuals who had otherwise qualified for subject status but failed to complete registration before 1975.

=== Legislative responses to migration ===
Indian nationality regulations were broadly permissive when they were first created at the time of the republic&#x27;s founding. Successive governments since the 1980s have gradually increased the difficulty of acquiring Indian citizenship in response to changing patterns of immigration from neighbouring countries.

Large-scale migration into Assam from Bengal began during colonial rule. British authorities encouraged workers from outside the region to resettle there to provide a continual source of labour for railway construction, agricultural development, and resource mining. The National Register of Citizens for Assam was created in 1951 to maintain a central ledger of all citizens in the state as a result of local discontent towards the influx of migrants.

Assam&#x27;s population growth rate was substantially higher than the rest of India for the entire period between 1901 and 1981. The highest levels of migration occurred in the decade following the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War; an estimated 1.8 million people settled in the state in the 1970s, compared to 221,000 in the 1950s and 424,000 in the 1960s. During a local election in 1979, a substantial portion of the enrolled electorate was discovered to be non-citizens. The ensuing backlash triggered the multi-year Assam Movement, which demanded the expulsion of foreigners in the state. Protest organisers and government officials ultimately agreed on the Assam Accord in 1985, which resulted in the addition of Section 6A to the Citizenship Act that same year. Under this change, any person who had been living in Assam prior to 1966 was an Indian citizen; those who settled there between 1966 and 1971 were removed from electoral rolls and subject to a 10-year waiting period before becoming eligible to register for citizenship. Migrants arriving after 1971 were all considered to have illegally immigrated.

Ethnic conflict in neighbouring Sri Lanka led to civil war in 1983. Following the start of hostilities, about 100,000 people sought refuge in India. This event, combined with sustained unrest in Assam, led to another amendment to the Citizenship Act in 1986 that limited citizenship by birth to children born to at least one Indian parent. A further amendment in 2003 restricted that entitlement only to children with two Indian parents, or those with one parent who is a citizen and if the other is not considered an illegal migrant. Mandatory registration in the National Register of Citizens for the entire country (contrasted with the register specific to Assam) was introduced in that year, as well as overseas citizenship for the Indian diaspora living abroad.

Restrictions were selectively relaxed in 2019 for migrants from neighbouring countries belonging to certain religious groups who illegally entered India before 2015; persons from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians are not counted as illegal migrants for nationality purposes and are eligible for a reduced six-year residence requirement for naturalisation. The enactment of these changes sparked widespread protests for countering the secular nature of earlier citizenship law.

The National Register of Citizens for Assam was comprehensively updated in 2019, with every citizen in the state required to show proof of their citizenship and pre-1971 settlement. 1.9 million people failed to provide sufficient documentation and were not listed on the register, leaving them stateless and subject to deportation.

== Acquisition and loss of citizenship ==

=== Entitlement by birth or descent ===
All persons born in India between 26 January 1950 and 1 July 1987 automatically received citizenship by birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. From 1 July 1987 until 3 December 2004, children born in the country received Indian citizenship by birth if at least one parent was a citizen. Since then, citizenship by birth is granted only if both parents are Indian citizens, or if one parent is a citizen and the other is not considered an illegal migrant.

Children born overseas are eligible to become Indian citizens by descent if at least one parent is a citizen. The birth of eligible persons must be registered at an Indian diplomatic mission within a certain time frame for citizenship to be granted. Individuals born before 3 September 2004 were not required to have had their birth registered and received citizenship by descent automatically, unless either parent was an Indian citizen by descent, in which case registration of their birth was mandatory. Prior to 10 December 1992, only children of Indian fathers (not mothers) were eligible for citizenship by descent. Indian citizens by descent who hold another nationality automatically cease to be Indian citizens six months after reaching the age of 18, unless they renounce their foreign nationality.

=== Voluntary acquisition ===
Certain non-citizens qualify for citizenship by registration if they are married to an Indian citizen, are minor children of Indian citizens, or are of Indian origin and living either in the country or outside the area of pre-partition India. Persons whose parents are Indian citizens, who themselves or their parents had previously held Indian citizenship, or have held overseas citizenship for at least five years are also eligible to acquire citizenship by registration. Eligible individuals must be resident in the country for at least 12 months prior to an application for registration, and are subject to additional residence requirements depending on the criterion they qualified under.

All other foreigners may become Indian citizens by naturalisation after residing in the country for at least 11 of the previous 14 years, with an additional 12 months of residence immediately preceding an application, a total of 12 years. Anyone acquiring Indian citizenship through either naturalisation or registration must renounce their previous nationalities. Between 2010 and 2019, about 21,000 people naturalised as Indian citizens.

Any person deemed to be an illegal migrant is typically barred from obtaining citizenship through both naturalisation and registration. However, migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, or Pakistan who belong to selected religious communities (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians) and arrived in India prior to 2015 are not considered illegal migrants. They are eligible for naturalisation with a reduced residence requirement; at least five years of residence during the previous 14-year period, along with the additional 12 months of residence immediately preceding an application.

=== Relinquishment and deprivation ===
Indian citizenship can be voluntarily relinquished by any person over the age of 18. Minor children of a person who gave up citizenship also cease to be citizens. On reaching adult age, these children have the option of resuming Indian citizenship within one year. Before 2003, relinquishment required holding nationality of another country, and all married women were considered to be of full age for the purposes of giving up citizenship regardless of their actual age. Minor children lost citizenship only if their fathers (not mothers) relinquished that status until 1992. Any Indian citizen who permanently settles in Pakistan or Bangladesh, or who voluntarily acquires citizenship of another country at any time automatically loses Indian citizenship. Between 2015 and 2019, about 670,000 people lost their Indian citizenship either through renunciation or automatic loss after acquiring a foreign nationality.

== Dual citizenship ==
Indian citizens by descent can be dual citizens till 18 upon which they have to choose a citizenship. Dual citizenship was allowed with specific countries till 2005. Citizenship amendment bill of 2003 allowed citizens by descent to continue Indian citizenship after 18 if they registered as overseas citizens. Residents of Goa have claimed to have dual citizenship since there was no law terminating their previous citizenship.

== Overseas citizenship ==

Former Indian citizens and descendants of citizens have been eligible for overseas citizenship since its creation in 2003. This status gives its holders a lifelong entitlement to live and work in the country but they cannot vote in elections, stand for public office, and are subject to restrictions on entry into protected and restricted areas. Overseas citizenship is a status created specifically to work around the constitutional prohibition on holding multiple nationalities; it is not considered a full form of Indian citizenship. All persons who (or whose parents or grandparents) have ever been citizens of Pakistan or Bangladesh are permanently ineligible for overseas citizenship.

<text>Fiend Without a Face is a 1958 independently made British black-and-white science fiction-horror film drama directed by Arthur Crabtree, and starring Marshall Thompson, Kynaston Reeves, Michael Balfour, and Kim Parker.

It was produced by John Croydon and Richard Gordon for Amalgamated Productions. The screenplay by Herbert J. Leder was based upon Amelia Reynolds Long&#x27;s 1930 short story &quot;The Thought Monster&quot;, originally published in the March 1930 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine. The film was released in the U.K. by Eros Films; in the U.S. it was released in June 1958 by MGM as a double feature with &quot;The Haunted Strangler&quot; (1958).

A scientist on an air base in Canada experiments with the materialisation of thought waves through atomic energy, which ultimately take the form of malevolent invisible killer brains, which then materialize as flying brains with attached spinal columns and eyestalks, strangling people with their spinal cords.

==Plot==
U. S. Air Force Interceptor Command Experimental Station No. 6 is a long-range radar installation located in rural Winthrop, Manitoba, Canada. Unexplained deaths begin to occur in the general area of a farming village near the American base. Postmortems reveal the victims were murdered and the brains and spinal cords are missing from the corpses; the only clue left behind are two puncture marks at the base of each skull. The locals, however, become convinced that radiation leaks from the radar installation&#x27;s nuclear-power experiments are the cause of the mysterious deaths.

Air Force Major Jeff Cummings begins an investigation as the local deaths continue, interviewing various townsfolk, while looking for anything unusual. Cummings becomes suspicious of Professor R. E. Walgate, a retired British scientist living near the airbase; Walgate is in the process of writing another book about his ongoing experiments with telekinesis, this time as it applies to thought projection. Major Cummings&#x27; suspicion of Walgate is later proved to be correct. The scientist finally admits he has not only succeeded in developing his mental ability, but in the process created a living thought projection. Unknown to Professor Walgate, the nuclear power radar experiments underway at the nearby U. S. airbase have greatly enhanced his mental abilities to the point that, through him, his living thought projection has become a malevolent and invisible new life form. It escaped from Walgate&#x27;s laboratory and is now attacking humans as a means of replicating physical, though still invisible, new versions of itself, all of which are now feeding on the base&#x27;s nuclear-generated power.

The invisible creatures eventually attack and kill the military personnel at the airbase in order to take over control of the radar station&#x27;s nuclear reactor; two of them dial-up the power to very dangerous levels. As they do so all the creatures suddenly become visible. Their now visible bodies are revealed to be the missing brains with spinal cords stolen from their victims; their spinal cords have become very flexible and have now sprouted tendrils. These mutations also allow the brain-spine creatures to move quickly and even leap distances; each brain-spine has also developed a pair of small eyes at the ends of extended eye stalks.

The slithering creations then attack Walgate&#x27;s home, where most of the film&#x27;s principal characters have gathered to discuss the crisis. Some of the brains get inside by breaking through a boarded-up window using their tendrils, while others leap to the roof and slither down through the fireplace&#x27;s open flue. Some of the defenders are attacked and killed, but well-aimed .45 semi-automatic pistol shots to the brains soon make short work of most of the attacking creatures; they gorily bleed out as they expire.

Walgate exits his home as a diversion, but is quickly attacked and killed by his creation. Meanwhile, Major Cummings escapes out the back way and quickly heads to the airbase, where he saves the day by blowing up the radar installation&#x27;s power machinery. This immediately robs the surviving brains of their high-energy food source, and the creatures quickly die, dissolving into puddles of goo.

==Production and release==

Noted science fiction personality, collector, and literary agent Forrest J Ackerman represented mystery and science fiction pulp writer Long and brokered the sale of her story &quot;The Thought Monster&quot; to the film&#x27;s producers.

Screenwriter Leder was originally set to direct the film, but being American, was unable to obtain a British work permit in time, so Crabtree replaced him as director. Thompson later said that when the director showed up on the first day of shooting and looked at the script, Crabtree claimed it was not the film he had been hired to direct, as he did not do &quot;monster&quot; films. After a heated argument with the producers, Crabtree left the set and did not show up for several days. In the interim, Thompson himself directed the film.

&quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; was made entirely in England. Its Canadian setting was chosen because it would appeal to both American and British Commonwealth movie audiences, while still being easy to replicate using the English shooting locations. U. S. Air Force stock aviation footage was also used to establish the military base setting and to pad out the film&#x27;s meager running time. The producers used primarily expatriate American and Canadian actors working in the United Kingdom, plus a few British actors dubbed by Americans.

The film&#x27;s visible brain creatures were created using stop-motion animation, an unusual practice for such a low-budget science fiction thriller of this era. The director of these effects sequences was Florenz Von Nordoff, while the actual stop-motion was done in Munich by Nordhoff&#x27;s partner, German special effects artist K. L. Ruppel. Peter Neilson headed up the British practical effects crew.

During July 1958, &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; first opened in the United States at the Rialto Theatre in New York City&#x27;s Theater District. The film&#x27;s producers placed an outdoor, front-of-the-house exhibit near the sidewalk that showcased a &quot;living and breathing Fiend&quot; in a steel-barred glass display case. It periodically moved its spinal cord tail, startling onlookers, and also made menacing sounds with the help of a concealed electrical device. The crowds that gathered to watch the caged Fiend grew so large that NYC police finally ordered the display case removed because it was creating a public disturbance.

Five months later, &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; created a public uproar after its British premiere at the Ritz Theatre in Leicester Square in London&#x27;s West End. The British Board of Film Censors had demanded a number of cuts before its release and finally granted the film an &quot;X&quot; certificate, but newspaper critics were still aghast at its horrifying special effects. Questions were actually raised in Parliament as to why British censors had allowed &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; to be released, notably: &quot;What is the British film industry thinking by trying to beat Hollywood at its own game of overdosing on blood and gore&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;For the most part this is tepidly macabre. What may give the film a special interest for devotees of the genre is the final scene in which the creatures, hitherto invisible, appear as mobile brains with proboscis projections and trailing tails; the anatomical device whereby they are able to fly through the air as well is not explained. The trick photography is the best for a long time and the monsters have been devised with a certain amount of originality.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote in May 1958, &quot;Up until the last two reels, this British-made science-fiction-horror program horror melodrama is fairly interesting in the usual fantastic sort of way, because it deals with unexplained, invisible monsters who strangle their victims and supposedly suck out their brains and spinal cords. During the final fifteen minutes, however, the picture, instead of being mystifying or horrifying, is just plain revolting, to an extent that even those with strong stomachs may not be able to take it ... Because of its excessive gore, the picture is too unpalatable to be classified as entertainment.&quot;

In contrast, a reviewer for &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; in June 1958 wrote, &quot;This entry in the science fiction, horror division sweepstakes is well and logically constructed, capably acted and directed with an eye toward building suspense. The cast is substantially unknown but exploitation of the horror angle is indicated and should be effective.&quot;

Later reviews concentrated on the low production values and lack of a cohesive plot, but with a 67% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; now is considered one of the best B movies of the 1950s.

James Rolfe called the film the &quot;best killer brain movie ever&quot; and stated that &quot;it may be the goriest film of its time&quot;.

Leonard Maltin noted the film&#x27;s &quot;horrific climax, [and] good special effects.&quot; Marcella Papandrea of &quot;The Super Network&quot; said, &quot;While the film gets off to a bit of a rocky start, it finds its footing fairly quickly though and it becomes quite immersive and intense.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 3/5 stars, writing: &quot;Arthur Crabtree&#x27;s &quot;Quatermass&quot;-style shocker starts off pretty ordinarily but, once the flying spinal cords whip into throat-choking action, the screams you hear may well be your own! British to the core, despite the pseudo-American trappings and fading Hollywood actor Marshall Thompson taking centre stage.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Tepid shocker with well-organised mobile brains.&quot;

In &quot;British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959&quot; David Quinlan rated the film as &quot;average&quot;, writing: &quot;Dreary horror film whose only (considerable) interest lies in the special effects, ahead of their time.&quot;

==Box office==
According to MGM records, &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; was released on a double bill with &quot;The Haunted Strangler&quot;. Together, the two films earned $350,000 in the United States and Canada, and $300,000 in England and elsewhere. The estimated production budget for &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; was £50,000 ($,000); MGM realized a profit of $160,000 on the movie.

While &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; was not a major hit, it was one of the more successful British films released in the U.S. in 1958. Unexpectedly, it performed better in the South, Midwest, and California than in the Northeast, where U.K. imports were usually more well received. MGM was also surprised by market research showing &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; to be a &quot;stronger draw by far&quot; than its companion release, &quot;The Haunted Strangler&quot;, which failed to generate much audience interest.

==Remakes==
On 22 March 2010, Roy Frumkes confirmed to &quot;Fangoria&quot; magazine that he planned to produce a remake of the film in 2011.

The online website Dread Central offered an October 2013 update from Frumkes on his &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; remake:

The website also posted a still from a fundraising trailer that Frumkes had shot for the remake with director Franco Frassetti. As of April 2023, that remake has yet to materialize.

Montreal-based filmmaker Rémi Fréchette produced, co-wrote and directed a web series (2013) and a horror comedy feature film (2014), both called &quot;Les Jaunes&quot;, which shared the themes and images of &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot;, including the military aspects, rural setting, and energy-based brain creatures. In &quot;Les Jaunes&quot;, an epidemic of yellow crawling brains threatens the lives of the inhabitants of Fort Vince, a reclusive Northern Quebec town.

==Home media==
The Criterion Collection, a video company known for its painstaking restorations of various film classics, released a deluxe DVD edition of &quot;Fiend Without a Face&quot; in 2007, having previously released it on LaserDisc.

A high-definition video transfer, created on a Spirit DataCine from a 35 mm film print, was struck from the film&#x27;s original negative. Thousands of pieces of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System. For optimal image quality, Criterion also encoded the dual-layer DVD-9 at the highest possible bit rate. The film&#x27;s original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit, and audio restoration tools were used to eliminate clicks, pops, hisses and crackles.

Criterion added these bonus DVD features to their release:
* A new widescreen 1.66: 1 transfer with a complete digital picture restoration enhanced for 16×9 hi-def televisions.
* Audio commentary: a conversation with executive producer Gordon and genre film writer Tom Weaver.
* An illustrated essay on British science fiction/horror film making by film historian Bruce Eder.
* A collection of movie trailers from various Gordon films: &quot;Fiend without a Face&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Strangler&quot;, &quot;Corridors of Blood&quot;, &quot;First Man into Space&quot; and &quot;The Atomic Submarine&quot;.
* Rare still photographs and ephemera, with audio commentary.
* Vintage advertisements and lobby cards.
