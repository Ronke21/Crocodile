<text>James Edward Hansen (born March 29, 1941) is an American adjunct professor directing the Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. He is best known for his research in climatology, his 1988 Congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming, and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change. In recent years, he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of global warming, on a few occasions leading to his arrest.

Hansen also proposed an alternative approach of global warming, where the 0.7°C global mean temperature increase of the last 100 years can essentially be explained by the effect of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide (such as methane).

==Early life and education==
Hansen was born in Denison, Iowa, to James Ivan Hansen and Gladys Ray Hansen. He was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. He obtained a B.A. in physics and mathematics with highest distinction in 1963, an M.S. in astronomy in 1965 and a Ph.D. in physics in 1967, all three degrees from the University of Iowa. He participated in the NASA graduate traineeship from 1962 to 1966 and, at the same time, between 1965 and 1966, he was a visiting student at the Institute of Astrophysics at Kyoto University and in the department of astronomy at the University of Tokyo. He then began work at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in 1967.

==Career==
After graduate school, Hansen continued his work with radiative transfer models, attempting to understand the Venusian atmosphere. He later applied and refined these models to understand the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and in particular, the effects that aerosols and trace gases have on Earth&#x27;s climate. His development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the Earth&#x27;s climate. In 2009, his first book, &quot;Storms of My Grandchildren&quot;, was published. In 2012, he presented the TED Talk &quot;Why I must speak out about climate change&quot;.

From 1981 to 2013, Hansen was the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, a part of the Goddard Space Flight Center.

, Hansen directs the Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions at Columbia University&#x27;s Earth Institute. The program is working to continue to &quot;connect the dots&quot; from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions.

Hansen is representing his granddaughter as well as &quot;future generations&quot; as plaintiffs in the &quot;Juliana v. United States&quot; lawsuit, which is suing the United States government and some of its executive branch&#x27;s positions for not protecting a stable climate system.

==Research and publications==
As a college student at the University of Iowa, Hansen was attracted to science and the research done by James Van Allen&#x27;s space science program in the physics and astronomy department. A decade later, his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition.

Hansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres, especially the interpretation of remote sensing of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and surface from satellites. Because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe, they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change. His other interests include the development of global circulation models to help understand the observed climate trends, and diagnosing human impacts on climate.

===Studies of Venus===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, following his Ph.D. dissertation, Hansen published several papers on the planet Venus. Venus has a high brightness temperature in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared. He proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet. More recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago, Venus&#x27;s atmosphere was much more like Earth&#x27;s than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface, but a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water, which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere.

Hansen continued his study of Venus by looking at the composition of its clouds. He looked at the near-infrared reflectivity of ice clouds, compared them to observations of Venus, and found that they qualitatively agreed. He also was able to use a radiative transfer model to establish an upper limit to the size of the ice particles if the clouds were actually made of ice.

By 1974, the composition of Venus&#x27; clouds had not yet been determined, with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds, including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride. Hansen and Hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a refractive index and cloud drop effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid. Kiyoshi Kawabata and Hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on Venus. They found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud, confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun.

The Pioneer Venus project was launched in May 1978 and reached Venus late that same year. Hansen collaborated with Larry Travis and other colleagues in a 1979 &quot;Science&quot; article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum. They concluded that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images: a thin haze layer, sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer. The linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low- and mid-level clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about 1 micrometer. Above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze. Evidence published in the early 1980s showed that the clouds consist mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets.

===Global temperature analysis===
The first NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) global temperature analysis was published in 1981. Hansen and his co-author analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from 1880 to 1985. Temperatures for stations closer together than 1000 kilometers were shown to be highly correlated, especially in the mid-latitudes, providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate long-term variations. They concluded that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the Northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions. Warming in the past century was found to be , with warming similar in both hemispheres. When the analysis was updated in 1988, the four warmest years on record were all in the 1980s. The two warmest years were 1981 and 1987. During a senate meeting on June 23, 1988, Hansen reported that he was ninety-nine percent certain the earth was warmer then than at any time in the history of instrumental measurements, there was a clear cause and effect relationship with the greenhouse effect and lastly that due to global warming, the likelihood of freak weather was steadily increasing.

With the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, 1992 saw a cooling in global temperatures. There was speculation that this would cause the next couple of years to be cooler because of the large serial correlation in the global temperatures. Bassett and Lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small. Hansen countered by saying that having insider information shifted the odds to those who know the physics of the climate system, and that whether there is a new temperature record depends upon the particular data set used.

The temperature data was updated in 1999 to report that 1998 was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in 1880. They also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history, and concluded that the recent El Niño was not solely responsible for the large temperature anomaly in 1998. In spite of this, the United States had seen a smaller degree of warming, and a region in the eastern U.S. and the western Atlantic Ocean had actually cooled slightly.

2001 saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated. It incorporated corrections due to the following reasons: time-of-observation bias; station history changes; classification of rural/urban station; the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity, and relying more on rural station than urban. Evidence was found of local urban warming in urban, suburban and small-town records.

The anomalously high global temperature in 1998 due to El Niño resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years. However, a 2001 Hansen report in the journal &quot;Science&quot; states that global warming continues, and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming. The temperature data was updated in 2006 to report that temperatures are now warmer than a century ago, and concluded that the recent global warming is a real climate change and not an artifact from the urban heat island effect. The regional variation of warming, with more warming in the higher latitudes, is further evidence of warming that is anthropogenic in origin.

In 2007, Stephen McIntyre notified GISS that many of the U.S. temperature records from the Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) displayed a discontinuity around the year 2000. NASA corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited McIntyre with pointing out the flaw. Hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake. In 2010, Hansen published a paper entitled &quot;Global Surface Temperature Change&quot; describing current global temperature analysis.

===Black carbon studies===
Hansen has also contributed toward the understanding of black carbon on regional climate. In recent decades, northern China has experienced increased drought, and southern China has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods. Southern China has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed. In a paper with Menon and colleagues, through the use of observations and climate models results, they conclude that the black carbon heats the air, increases convection and precipitation, and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates.

A year later, Hansen teamed with Makiko Sato to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of AERONET sun photometers. While the location of the AERONET instruments did not represent a global sample, they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies. They found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least 2. This corresponds to an increase in the climate forcing of around , which they hypothesize is partially offset by the cooling of non-absorbing aerosols.

Estimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the 1880s after the start of the Industrial Revolution, and a leveling off from 1900 to 1950 as environmental laws were enacted. China and India have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development. The emissions from the United Kingdom were estimated using a network of stations that measured black smoke and sulfur dioxide. They report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the 1960s, and that the decline was faster than the decline in black-carbon-producing fuel use.

A 2007 paper used the GISS climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic. Much of the arctic aerosol comes from south Asia. Countries such as the United States and Russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed.

===Anthropogenic impact on climate===
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.

In 2000, Hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last 100 years, arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via carbon dioxide () largely balanced each other out, and that the 0.74±0.18 °C net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons. However, even then he wrote &quot;the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance of CO2 over aerosols&quot;.

In 2003, Hansen wrote a paper called &quot;Can We Defuse the Global Warming Time Bomb?&quot; in which he argued that human-caused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones, and that this, over a long time period, can cause large climate changes. He further stated that a lower limit on &quot;dangerous anthropogenic interference&quot; was set by the stability of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. His view on actions to mitigate climate change was that &quot;halting global warming requires urgent, unprecedented international cooperation, but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health, agriculture and the environment.&quot;

In a 2004 presentation at the University of Iowa, Hansen announced that he was told by high-ranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because it was not understood what &#x27;dangerous&#x27; meant, or how humans were actually affecting climate. He described this as a Faustian bargain because atmospheric aerosols had health risks, and should be reduced, but doing so would effectively increase the warming effects from .

Hansen and coauthors proposed that the global mean temperature was a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Two elements were identified as particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference: sea level rise and the extinction of species. They described a business-as-usual scenario, which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately 2% per year; and an alternate scenario, in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline. Under the alternate scenario, sea levels could rise by 1 meter per century, causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas. But this would be minor compared to the 10-meter increase in sea level under the business-as-usual scenario. Hansen described the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise. Assuming the alternate scenario, the situation would not be good, but it would be much worse for business as usual.

The concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a 2007 paper, finding that further warming of 1 °C would be highly disruptive to humans. An alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below 3 °C for doubled . The conclusion was that levels above 450 ppm were considered dangerous, but that reduction in non- greenhouse gases could provide temporary relief from drastic cuts. Further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by non- constituents as much as by . The 2007 paper cautioned that prompt action is needed to slow growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference.

===Climate model development and projections===
Vilhelm Bjerknes began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early 20th century. The progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations. It was not until the 1950s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic. Hansen&#x27;s first contribution to numerical climate models came with the 1974 publication of the GISS model. He and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sea-level pressure and 500mb heights in the North American region.

A 1981 &quot;Science&quot; publication by Hansen and a team of scientists at Goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted. They used a one-dimensional radiative-convective model that calculates temperature as a function of height. They reported that the results from the 1D model are similar to those of the more complex 3D models, and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks. Hansen predicted that temperatures would rise out of the climate noise by the 1990s, much earlier than predicted by other researches. He also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react.

By the early 1980s, the computational speed of computers, along with refinements in climate models, allowed longer experiments. The models now included physics beyond the previous equations, such as convection schemes, diurnal changes, and snow-depth calculations. The advances in computational efficiency, combined with the added physics, meant the GISS model could be run for five years. It was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a grid-point resolution as coarse as 1000 kilometers.

The first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by Hansen was in 1988, the same year as his well-known Senate testimony. The second generation of the GISS model was used to estimate the change in mean surface temperature based on a variety of scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. Hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades, and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the Eemian. He argued that if the temperature rose above the 1950–1980 mean for a few years, it would be the &quot;smoking gun&quot; pointing to human-caused global warming.
In 2006, Hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by Hansen in his 1988 testimony before the United States Congress. They described the intermediate scenario as the most likely, and that real-world greenhouse gas forcing had been closest to this scenario. It contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fifty-year projections. They found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios. The warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios were nearly the same through the year 2000, and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment. They noted that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the climate sensitivity used was higher than current estimates.

A year later, Hansen joined with Rahmstorf and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations. The comparison was done from 1990 through January 2007 against physics-based models that are independent from the observations after 1990. They showed that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate. Rahmstorf and coauthors showed concern that sea levels are rising at the high range of the IPCC projections, and that this was due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets.

Following the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures, Roy Spencer and John Christy published the first version of their satellite temperature measurements in 1990. Contrary to climate models and surface measurements, their results showed a cooling in the troposphere. However, in 1998, Wentz and Schabel determined that orbital decay had an effect on the derived temperatures. Hansen compared the corrected troposphere temperatures with the results of the published GISS model, and concluded that the model is in good agreement with the observations, noting that the satellite temperature data had been the last holdout of global warming denialists, and that the correction of the data would result in a change from discussing whether global warming is occurring to what is the rate of global warming, and what should be done about it.

Hansen has continued the development and diagnostics of climate models. For instance, he has helped in the investigations of the decadal trends in tropopause height, which could be a useful tool for determining the human &quot;fingerprint&quot; on climate. , the current version of the GISS model is Model E. This version has seen improvements in many areas, including upper-level winds, cloud height, and precipitation. This model still has problems with regions of marine stratocumulus clouds. A later paper showed that the model&#x27;s main problems are having too weak of an ENSO-like variability, and poor sea ice modeling, resulting in too little ice in the Southern Hemisphere and too much in the Northern Hemisphere.

===Climate forcings, feedbacks, and sensitivity===
In 2000 Hansen authored a paper called &quot;Global warming in the twenty-first century: an alternative scenario&quot; in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming, focusing on non-CO2 gases and black carbon in the short run, giving more time to make reductions in fossil fuel emissions. He notes that the net warming observed to date is roughly as big as that expected from non-CO2 gases only. This is because CO2 warming is offset by climate-cooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time non-CO2 gases, taken together, were responsible for roughly 50% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming.

In a 2007 paper, Hansen discussed the potential danger of &quot;fast-feedback&quot; effects causing ice sheet disintegration, based on paleoclimate data. George Monbiot reports &quot;The IPCC predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as this century. Hansen&#x27;s paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects doesn&#x27;t fit the data. The geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion, but flips suddenly from one state to another. When temperatures increased to 2 - 3 °C (3.6-5.4 °F) above today&#x27;s level 3.5 million years ago, sea levels rose not by 59 centimeters but by . The ice responded immediately to changes in temperature.&quot;

Hansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions. &quot;It is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem … An ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable, and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.&quot; He concludes that &quot;present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of human-made [greenhouse gases]. However, it is much lower than has commonly been assumed. If we have not already passed the dangerous level, the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades.&quot;

In 2013, Hansen authored a paper called &quot;Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide,&quot; in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be (3±1)°C based on Pleistocene paleoclimate data. The paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels &quot;would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans.&quot;

In 2016, a team of 19 researchers led by Hansen published a paper &quot;Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming could be dangerous&quot; describing the effect of meltwater from ice sheets on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (slowing it or even stopping) and Antarctic bottom water formation. This would speed up ice sheet melting and sea level rise by increasing the water temperature at hundreds of meters depth, thawing ice shelves from below. And the cool fresh meltwater on the ocean close to Greenland and Antarctica leads to larger temperature difference between tropics and middle latitudes, what would enable storms as strong as in the last interglacial, the Eemian, whose evidence includes, among others, megaboulders on Bahamas.

In 2023, Hansen led a team of 18 researchers to publish a paper titled &quot;Global Warming in the Pipeline.&quot; In it, Hansen et al. concluded that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to an increase of 4.8 ±1.2°C, significantly above earlier estimates. His team also concluded that the decline in global aerosol emissions from air pollution will accelerate the rate of global warming, going from an increase of 0.18 °C per decade between 1970 and 2010 to an increase of 0.27 °C per decade after 2010, with the world passing the 1.5 °C threshold before the end of the 2020s and the 2 °C threshold before 2050 without significant changes. The paper also concluded that sea level rise will be greater than the IPCC estimates and one of the ocean&#x27;s major circulation systems could collapse before the end of the century.

==Analysis of climate change causation==
Hansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change, the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions, but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

By this measure, among major economies, as of 2009 the U.K. still had the highest cumulative per capita contribution to climate change, followed by the U.S. and Germany, even though the People&#x27;s Republic of China currently produces the highest total annual emissions.

On public policy, Hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change. He points specifically to the Competitive Enterprise Institute&#x27;s commercials with the tagline &quot;carbon dioxide—they call it pollution, we call it life&quot;, and politicians who accept money from fossil-fuel interests and then describe global warming as &quot;a great hoax.&quot; He also says that changes needed to reduce global warming do not require hardship or reduction in the quality of life, but will also produce benefits such as cleaner air and water, and growth of high-tech industries. He was a critic of both the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations&#x27; stances on climate change. Addressing the potential effects of climate change, Hansen has stated in an interview in January 2009, &quot;We cannot now afford to put off change any longer. We have to get on a new path within this new administration. We have only four years left for Obama to set an example to the rest of the world. America must take the lead.&quot;

==Climate change activism==

=== US Senate committee testimony ===

Hansen was invited by Rafe Pomerance to testify before the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on June 23, 1988. Hansen testified that &quot;Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming...It is already happening now&quot; and &quot;The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now...We already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important.&quot; Hansen said that NASA was 99% confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation.

According to science historian Spencer R. Weart, Hansen&#x27;s testimony increased public awareness of climate change. According to Richard Besel of California Polytechnic State University, Hansen&#x27;s testimony &quot;was an important turning point in the history of global climate change.&quot; According to Timothy M. O&#x27;Donnell of the University of Mary Washington, Hansen&#x27;s testimony was &quot;pivotal,&quot; &quot;ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate,&quot; and marked &quot;the official beginning of the global warming policy debate.&quot; According to Roger A. Pielke of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hansen&#x27;s &quot;call to action&quot; &quot;elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes, floods, and heat waves, to unprecedented levels of attention from the public, media, and policy makers.&quot;

===Criticism of coal industry===
Hansen has been particularly critical of the coal industry, stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. He has called for phasing out coal power completely by the year 2030.

During his testimony before the Iowa Utilities Board in 2007, Hansen likened coal trains to &quot;death trains&quot; and asserted that these would be &quot;no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria, loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species.&quot; In response, the National Mining Association stated that his comparison &quot;trivialized the suffering of millions&quot; and &quot;undermined his credibility.&quot; Citing the reactions of &quot;several people&quot; and &quot;three of his scientific colleagues&quot; as his primary motivation, Hansen stated that he certainly did not mean to trivialize suffering by the families who lost relatives in the Holocaust and then apologized, saying he regretted that his words caused pain to some readers.

====Mountaintop removal mining====

On June 23, 2009, James Hansen, along with 30 other protesters including actress Daryl Hannah, was arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing police and impeding traffic, during a protest against mountaintop removal mining in Raleigh County, West Virginia. The protesters intended to enter the property of Massey Energy Company, but were blocked by a crowd of several hundred coal miners and supporters. Hansen said that mountaintop removal for coal mining &quot;[provides] only a small fraction of our energy&quot; and &quot;should be abolished.&quot; Hansen called on President Barack Obama to abolish mountaintop coal mining.

After Hansen&#x27;s arrest, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Andrew Revkin wrote: &quot;Dr. Hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists, particularly government scientists, in the environmental policy debate.&quot;

Hansen and about 100 other people were arrested in September 2010 in front of the White House in Washington, DC. The group was seeking a ban on mountaintop removal or surface mining.

===Cap and trade===
In 2009 Hansen spoke out against cap and trade, advocating instead what he believes would be a progressive carbon tax at source carbon as oil, gas or coal, with a 100% dividend returned to citizens in equal shares, as proposed by Citizens&#x27; Climate Lobby. He has made many appearances and talks supporting the work of CCL.

===Retirement from NASA===
Hansen retired from NASA in April 2013 after 46 years of government service, saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit greenhouse gases. The same month, the National Center for Science Education, an organization noted for defending the teaching of evolution in United States science classrooms, named Hansen as an advisor to support the extension of its area of concern into the teaching of climate change.

===Keystone Pipeline===
In a CBC interview aired in April 2013, as Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver lobbied in Washington, DC for approval of the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada&#x27;s Athabasca Oil Sands to the Gulf of Mexico, Hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other energy organizations &quot;there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil&quot; than in conventional oil. Hansen argued that coal, tar sands, and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the Keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands. He explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future: &quot;It&#x27;s not the case where you emit something and you see the effect. We see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear … Effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system. It takes decades, even centuries to get the full response. But we know the last time the world was 2 degrees warmer, sea level was 6 meters or 20 feet higher.&quot; Hansen urged President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada&#x27;s Athabasca Oil Sands to the Gulf of Mexico. On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during a further protest against the proposed Keystone pipeline extension.

===Proposed solutions===

Recently Hansen stated his support for a revenue-neutral fee and dividend system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the United States. In an interview on CBC television on March 3, 2015, Dr Hansen stated &quot;The solution [to climate change] has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly. They make no sense at all if you look at it from an economic-wide perspective. If we would simply put a fee on carbon – you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source (the domestic mines or the ports of entry) and then distribute that money to the public, an equal amount to all legal residents, that would begin to make the prices honest. And that&#x27;s what the economy needs in order to be most efficient. Right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public. If your child gets asthma, you pay the bill, the fossil fuel company doesn&#x27;t. What we need is to make the system honest.&quot;

At the end of 2008, Hansen stated five priorities that he felt then President-elect Barack Obama should adopt &quot;for solving the climate and energy problems, while stimulating the economy&quot;: efficient energy use, renewable energy, a smart grid, generation IV nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage. Regarding nuclear, he expressed opposition to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, stating that the $25 Billion (US) surplus held in the Nuclear Waste Fund &quot;should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste, and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new long-lived nuclear waste.&quot;

In 2009, Hansen wrote an open letter to President Obama where he advocated a &quot;Moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store CO2&quot;. In his first book &quot;Storms of My Grandchildren&quot;, similarly, Hansen discusses his &quot;Declaration of Stewardship&quot;, the first principle of which requires &quot;a moratorium on coal-fired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide&quot;.

In March 2013, Hansen co-authored a paper in &quot;Environmental Science &amp; Technology&quot;, entitled &quot;Prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power&quot;. The paper examined mortality rates per unit of electrical power produced from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) as well as nuclear power. It estimated that 1.8 million air pollution-caused deaths were prevented worldwide between 1971 and 2009, through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels. The paper also concluded that the emission of some 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between 1971 and 2009. Looking to the future, between 2010 and 2050, it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to 420,000 to 7 million premature deaths and 80 to 240 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.

This paper elicited a critical response to Kharecha and Hansen&#x27;s analysis, from an international group of senior academic energy policy analysts, including Benjamin Sovacool, M.V. Ramana, Mark Z. Jacobson, and Mark Diesendorf. They asserted that nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable, and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants. Sovacool et al. also claim that Kharecha and Hansen&#x27;s estimates of Chernobyl Disaster mortalities is very low, which biases their conclusions. All of these factors are said to make Kharecha and Hansen&#x27;s article &quot;incomplete and misleading&quot;. Kharecha and Hansen countered that all the data these scientists use to make their criticism, &quot;lacks credibility&quot;.

In 2013, Hansen and three other leading climate experts wrote an open letter to policy makers, saying that &quot;continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity&#x27;s ability to avoid dangerous climate change.&quot; The reaction from anti-nuclear environmental groups (e.g. the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and Greenpeace) was negative, citing nuclear safety and security issues, and the economics of nuclear power plants.

Together with Michael Shellenberger, Hansen began touring the world in the late 2010s, providing evidence for the climatic benefits of nuclear energy and to bring attention to the $2 trillion the US has spent on &quot;new renewables&quot; that despite the cost have not even caught up to nuclear in annual electricity generation, an issue reflected in Germany and elsewhere.

===Political interference at NASA===
In 2006, Hansen alleged that NASA administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change. Hansen said that NASA public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a December 2005 lecture at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. NASA responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception. Two years after Hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political , the agency&#x27;s inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place, with the NASA Office of Public Affairs having &quot;reduced, marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public&quot;.

In June 2006, Hansen appeared on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; stating that the George W. Bush White House had edited climate-related press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening. He also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials, and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career.

===Trials for energy company executives===
In 2008 interviews with &quot;ABC News&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and in a separate op-ed, Hansen has called for putting fossil fuel company executives, including the CEOs of ExxonMobil and Peabody Coal, on trial for &quot;high crimes against humanity and nature&quot;, on the grounds that these and other fossil-fuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about global warming, in the same way that tobacco companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer.

===Arrest at 2011 demonstration===
Hansen and 1,251 other activists were arrested at a two week long protest in August and September 2011, in front of the White House. Hansen urged President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada&#x27;s Athabasca Tar Sands to the Gulf of Mexico. On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during a further protest against the proposed Keystone pipeline extension.

===Criticism===

In June 2009, &quot;New Yorker&quot; journalist Elizabeth Kolbert wrote that Hansen is &quot;increasingly isolated among climate activists.&quot; Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that &quot;I view Jim Hansen as heroic as a scientist... But I wish he would stick to what he really knows. Because I don&#x27;t think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible, or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem.&quot;

In July 2009, &quot;New York Times&quot; climate columnist Christa Marshall asked if Hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate, noting that he &quot;has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against President Obama&#x27;s plan for a cap-and-trade system.&quot; &quot;The right wing loves what he&#x27;s doing,&quot; said Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. Hansen said that he had to speak out, since few others could explain the links between politics and the climate models. &quot;You just have to say what you think is right,&quot; he said.

==Honors and awards==
Hansen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1996 for his &quot;development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres; development of simplified and three-dimensional global climate models; explication of climate forcing mechanisms; analysis of current climate trends from observational data; and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system.&quot; In 2001, he received the 7th Annual Heinz Award in the Environment (endowed with US$250,000) for his research on global warming, and was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in 2006. Also in 2006, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) selected James Hansen to receive its Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility &quot;for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists&#x27; responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance.&quot;

In 2007, Hansen shared the US$1-million Dan David Prize for &quot;achievements having an outstanding scientific, technological, cultural or social impact on our world&quot;. In 2008, he received the PNC Bank Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service for his &quot;outstanding achievements&quot; in science. At the end of 2008, Hansen was named by EarthSky Communications and a panel of 600 scientist-advisors as the &quot;Scientist Communicator of the Year&quot;, citing him as an &quot;outspoken authority on climate change&quot; who had &quot;best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during 2008.&quot;

In 2009, Hansen was awarded the 2009 Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the American Meteorological Society, for his &quot;outstanding contributions to climate modeling, understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity, and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena.&quot;

Andrew Freedman wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the Society had erred in giving Hansen the medal: &quot;His body of work is not at issue... Rather, the problem arises due to the AMS&#x27; recognition of Hansen&#x27;s public communication work on climate change.&quot;

Hansen won the 2010 Sophie Prize, set up in 1997 by Norwegian Jostein Gaarder, the author of the 1991 best-selling novel and teenagers&#x27; guide to philosophy &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot;, for his &quot; key role for the development of our understanding of human-induced climate change.&quot;

&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; named Hansen one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers &quot;for sounding the alarm on climate change, early and often&quot;.

In December 2012, Hansen received the Commonwealth Club of California&#x27;s annual Stephen H. Schneider Award for Outstanding Climate Science Communications at a ceremony in San Francisco

On November 7, 2013, Hansen received the Joseph Priestley Award at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania &quot;...for his work advancing our understanding of climate change, including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans&#x27; impact on climate, and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy.&quot; He delivered a lecture, entitled, &quot;White House Arrest and the Climate Crisis,&quot; later that same day at Anita Tuvin Schlechter Auditorium on the college&#x27;s campus.

James Hansen was co-winner with climatologist Syukuro Manabe of the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Climate Change category in the ninth edition (2016) of the awards. The two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior. Decades ago, they correctly predicted how much Earth&#x27;s temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric . The scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by Manabe and Hansen.

In June 2018, Hansen was named joint winner, with Veerabhadran Ramanathan, of Taiwan&#x27;s Tang Prize. Hansen&#x27;s prize had a total value of NT$25 million.

<text>Kalmykia, officially the Republic of Kalmykia, is a republic of Russia, located in the Volga region of European Russia. The republic is part of the Southern Federal District, and borders Dagestan to the south and Stavropol Krai to the southwest; Volgograd Oblast to the northwest and north and Astrakhan Oblast to the north and east; Rostov Oblast to the west and the Caspian Sea to the east. Through the Caspian Depression, the Kuma river forms Kalmykia&#x27;s natural border with Dagestan. Kalmykia is the only polity within Europe where the Dharmic religion of Buddhism is the predominant religion whose sole main form is Tibetan Buddhism of Gelug and Kagyu lineages.

The Kalmykia republic covers an area of , with a small population of about 275,000 residents. The republic of Kalmykia is home of the Kalmyks, a people of Oirat Mongolian origin who are mainly of Tibetan Buddhist faith. The capital of the republic is the city of Elista.

==Geography==
The republic is located in Southern Russia, lying north of the North Caucasus. A small stretch of the Volga River flows through eastern Kalmykia. Other major rivers include the Yegorlyk, the Kuma, and the Manych. Lake Manych-Gudilo is the largest lake; other lakes of significance include Lakes Sarpa and Tsagan-Khak. The highest point in Kalmykia is shared, with an elevation of ; it is located in the Yergeni hills.

Kalmykia&#x27;s natural resources include coal, oil, and natural gas.

===Climate===
The average January temperature is and the average July temperature is . Average annual precipitation ranges from in the east of the republic to in the west. The small town of Utta is the hottest place in Russia. On 12 July 2010, during a significant heatwave affecting all of Russia, an all-time record-high temperature was observed at .

=== Flora and fauna ===

The republic&#x27;s wildlife includes the saiga antelope, whose habitat is protected in Chyornye Zemli Nature Reserve.

==History==


According to the Kurgan hypothesis, the upland regions of modern-day Kalmykia formed part of the cradle of Indo-European culture. Hundreds of kurgans can be seen in these areas, known as the Indo-European &quot;Urheimat&quot; (Samara culture, Sredny Stog culture, Yamna culture).

Some of the first recorded peoples to move into this territory were the Scythians and Sarmatians from the central Eurasian steppe, bringing their respective religious systems with them. Later on, all three major Abrahamic religions also took root, with the Khazar conversion to Judaism being a notable (if historically contested) episode in the religion&#x27;s history. The Alans were a major Muslim people group, who faced the invading Mongols and their Tengrist practices, with some of the latter settling permanently. The later Nogais were Muslim, but were replaced by the contemporaneous Mongolian Kalmyks, who practice Tibetan Buddhism. With the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire, there was an influx of the East Slavic-speaking Russian Orthodox settlers. Many religious institutions were suppressed in the wake of the Russian Revolution.

===Kalmyk autonomy===

The ancestors of the Kalmyks, the Oirats, migrated from the steppes of southern Siberia on the banks of the Irtysh River, reaching the Lower Volga region by the early 17th century. Historians have given various explanations for the move, but generally recognise that the Kalmyks sought abundant pastures for their herds. Another motivation may have involved escaping the growing dominance of the neighbouring Dzungar Mongol tribe.
They reached the lower Volga region in or about 1630. That land, however, was not uncontested pastures, but rather the homeland of the Nogai Horde, a confederation of Turkic-speaking nomadic tribes. The Kalmyks expelled the Nogais, who fled to the Caucasian plains and to the Crimean Khanate, areas (at least theoretically) under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Some Nogai groups sought the protection of the Russian garrison at Astrakhan. The remaining nomadic Mongol Oirat tribes became vassals of the Kalmyk Khan.

The Kalmyks settled in the wide-open steppes – from Saratov in the north to Astrakhan on the Volga delta in the south and to the Terek River in the southwest. They also encamped on both sides of the Volga River, from the Don River in the west to the Ural River in the east. Although these territories had been recently annexed by the Tsardom of Russia, Moscow was in no position to settle the area with Russian colonists. This area under Kalmyk control would eventually be called the Kalmyk Khanate.

Within twenty-five years of settling in the Lower Volga region, the Kalmyks became subjects of the Tsar of Russia. In exchange for protecting Russia&#x27;s southern border, the Kalmyks were promised an annual allowance and access to the markets of Russian border settlements. The open access to Russian markets was supposed to discourage mutual raiding on the part of the Kalmyks and of the Russians and Bashkirs, a Russian-dominated Turkic people, but this was not often the practice. In addition, Kalmyk allegiance was often nominal, as the Kalmyk Khans practised self-government, based on a set of laws they called the Great Code of the Nomads (&quot;Iki Tsaadzhin Bichig&quot;).

The Kalmyk Khanate reached its peak of military and political power under Ayuka Khan (ruled 1672–1724, khan 1690–1724). During his era, the Kalmyk Khanate fulfilled its responsibility to protect the southern borders of Russia and conducted many military expeditions against its Turkic-speaking neighbours. Successful military expeditions were also conducted in the Caucasus. The Khanate experienced economic prosperity from free trade with Russian border towns, with China, with Tibet and with Muslim neighbours. During this era, the Kalmyks also kept close contacts with their Oirat kinsmen in Dzungaria, as well as with the Dalai Lama in Tibet.

===Russian Civil War===

After the October Revolution in 1917, many Don Kalmyks joined the White Russian army and fought under the command of Generals Denikin and Wrangel during the Russian Civil War. Before the Red Army broke through to the Crimean Peninsula towards the end of 1920, a large group of Kalmyks fled from Russia with the remnants of the defeated White Army to the Black Sea ports of Turkey.

The majority of the refugees chose to resettle in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Other, much smaller, groups chose Sofia (Bulgaria), Prague (Czechoslovakia) and Paris and Lyon (France). The Kalmyk refugees in Belgrade built a Buddhist temple there in 1929.

===Soviet period===

In July 1919, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin issued an appeal to the Kalmyk people, calling for them to revolt and to aid the Red Army. Lenin promised to provide the Kalmyks, among other things, a sufficient quantity of land for their own use. The promise came to fruition on 4 November 1920, when a resolution was passed by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee proclaiming the formation of the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast. Fifteen years later, on 22 October 1935, the Oblast was elevated to republic status, Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

In line with the policy of &quot;Korenizatsiya&quot; based on the concept of titular nations, the government of the Soviet Union adopted a strategy of national delimitation, while at the same time enforcing the Leninist principle of democratic centralism. According to Dorzha Arbakov, decentralized governing bodies were a tool the Bolsheviks used to control the Kalmyk people:

After establishing control, the Soviet authorities did not overtly enforce an anti-religion policy, other than through passive means, because it sought to bring Mongolia and Tibet into its sphere of influence. The government also was compelled to respond to domestic disturbances resulting from the economic policies of War Communism and the 1921 famine.
The passive measures that were taken by Soviet authorities to control the people included the imposition of a harsh tax to close places of worship and religious schools. The Cyrillic script replaced Todo Bichig, the traditional Kalmyk vertical script.

On 22 January 1922, Mongolia proposed to migrate the Kalmyks during the famine in Kalmykia. Russia refused help; 71–72,000 Kalmyks died during the famine. Revolts erupted among the Kalmyks in 1926 and 1930 (on 1942–1943, see the next section). In March 1927, Soviet deported 20,000 Kalmyks to the tundras of Siberia and Karelia.

The Kalmyks of the Don Voisko Oblast were subject to the policies of de-cossackization where villages were destroyed, khuruls (temples) and monasteries were burned down and executions were indiscriminate. At the same time, grain, livestock and other foodstuffs were seized. 
In December 1927 the Fifteenth Party Congress of the Soviet Union passed a resolution calling for the &quot;voluntary&quot; collectivization of agriculture. The change in policy was accompanied by a new campaign of repression, directed initially against the small farming class. The objective of this campaign was to suppress the resistance of farming peasants to the full-scale collectivization of agriculture.

===World War II===
On 22 June 1941, the German army invaded the Soviet Union. By 12 August 1942, the German Army Group South captured Elista, the capital of the Kalmyk ASSR. After capturing the Kalmyk territory, German army officials established a propaganda campaign with the assistance of anti-communist Kalmyk nationalists, including white emigre, Kalmyk exiles. The total Jewish dead numbered between 100 and upwards of 700, according to documents held in the Kalmyk State Archives. The campaign was focused primarily on recruiting and organizing Kalmyk men into anti-Soviet militia units.

*Kalmüken Verband Dr. Doll (Kalmukian Volunteers)
*Abwehrtrupp 103 (Kalmukian Volunteers)
*Kalmücken-Legion or Kalmücken-Kavallerie-Korps (Kalmukian Volunteers)

The Kalmyk units were extremely successful in flushing out and killing Soviet partisans. But by December 1942, the Soviet Red Army retook the Kalmyk ASSR, forcing the Kalmyks assigned to those units to flee, in some cases with their wives and children in hand.

The Kalmyk units retreated westward into unfamiliar territory with the retreating German army and were reorganized into the Kalmuck Legion, although the Kalmyks themselves preferred the name Kalmuck Cavalry Corps. The casualty rate also increased substantially during the retreat, especially among the Kalmyk officers. To replace those killed, the German army imposed forced conscription, taking in teenagers and middle-aged men. As a result, the overall effectiveness of the Kalmyk units declined.

By the end of the war, the remnants of the Kalmuck Cavalry Corps had made their way to Austria where the Kalmyk soldiers and their family members became post-war refugees.

Those who did not want to leave formed militia units that chose to stay behind and harass the oncoming Soviet Red Army.

Although a number of Kalmyks chose to fight against the Soviet Union, the majority by and large did not, fighting the German army in regular Soviet Red army units and in partisan resistance units behind the battlelines throughout the Soviet Union. Before their removal from the Soviet Red Army and from partisan resistance units after December 1943, approximately 8,000 Kalmyks were awarded various orders and medals, including 21 Kalmyk men who were recognized as a Hero of the Soviet Union.

On 27 December 1943, Soviet authorities declared that &quot;many Kalmyks&quot; were guilty of cooperation with the German Army and cited that as a justification to order the deportation of the entire Kalmyk population, including those who had served with the Soviet Army, to various locations in Central Asia and Siberia. In conjunction with the deportation, the Kalmyk ASSR was abolished and its territory was split between adjacent Astrakhan, Rostov and Stalingrad Oblasts and Stavropol Krai. To completely obliterate any traces of the Kalmyk people, the Soviet authorities renamed the former republic&#x27;s towns and villages.

===Post-war Kalmykia===

Due to their widespread dispersal in Siberia, their language and culture suffered a possibly irreversible decline. Khrushchev finally allowed their return in 1957, when they found their homes, jobs, and land occupied by imported Russians and Ukrainians, who remained. On 9 January 1957, Kalmykia again became an autonomous oblast, and on 29 July 1958, an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR.

In the following years, bad planning of agricultural and irrigation projects resulted in widespread desertification. On orders from Moscow, sheep production increased beyond levels that the fragile steppe could sustain, resulting in 1.4 million acres (5666 km2) of the artificial desert. To ramp up output, economically nonviable industrial plants were constructed.

After the dissolution of the USSR, Kalmykia kept the status of an autonomous republic within the newly formed Russian Federation (effective 31 March 1992).

==Politics==
The head of the government in Kalmykia is called &quot;The Head of the Republic&quot;. After a reform in 2006 that made the governors of the federal subjects appointable by the President, the President of Russia selected a candidate for the Head of the Republic position and presented it to the Parliament of Kalmyk Republic, the People&#x27;s Khural, for approval. If a candidate was not approved, the President of the Russian Federation could dissolve the Parliament and set up new elections. Since the reform was revoked in 2011, the Head of the Republic has been elected by a direct vote, the first such election happening in 2014.

From 1993 to 2010, the Head of the Republic was Kirsan Nikolayevich Ilyumzhinov. He also was the president of the world chess organization FIDE until 2018. He has spent much of his fortune on promoting chess in Kalmykia—where chess is compulsory in all primary schools—and also overseas, with Elista, the capital of Kalmykia, hosting many international tournaments.

In the late 1990s, the Ilyumzhinov government was alleged to be spending too much government money on chess-related projects. The allegations were published in Sovietskaya Kalmykia, the opposition newspaper in Elista. Larisa Yudina, the journalist who investigated these accusations, was kidnapped and murdered in 1998. Two men, Sergei Vaskin and Tyurbi Boskomdzhiv, who worked in the local civil service, were charged with her murder, one of them having been a former presidential bodyguard. After prolonged investigations by the Russian authorities, both men were found guilty and jailed, but no evidence was discovered that Ilyumzhinov himself was in any way responsible.

On 24 October 2010, Ilyumzhinov was replaced by Alexey Orlov as the new Head of Kalmykia. Since September 2019 the acting President of Kalmykia is Batu Khasikov.

Since 2008, Anatoly Kozachko has been President of the Parliament, the People&#x27;s Khural. The current Prime Minister of Kalmykia is Lyudmila Ivanovna. All the three top politicians belong to the Kremlin&#x27;s &quot;United Russia&quot; Party.

The Oirat-Kalmyk People&#x27;s Congress has been convening since 2015 and supporting certain people in the People&#x27;s Khural of Kalmykia elections, as well as pushing for political change inside Kalmykia. It is now part of the Free Nations League, an organization which advocates the dissolution of the Russian Federation.

==Administrative divisions==

Republic of Kalmykia is administratively divided into 13 districts, 3 cities or towns and 111 selsoviets.

===Religion===
Tibetan Buddhism is the traditional and most popular religion among the Kalmyks, while ethnic Russians in the country practice predominantly Russian Orthodoxy. A minority of Kalmyks practice pre-Buddhist shamanism or Tengrism (a contemporary revival of the Turkic and Mongolic shamanic religions). Many people are unaffiliated and non-religious.

According to a 2012 survey, 47.6% of the population of Kalmykia adhere to Buddhism, 18% to the Russian Orthodox Church, 4.8% to Islam, 3% to Tengrism or Kalmyk shamanism, 1% are unaffiliated Christians, 1% are either Orthodox Christian believers who do not belong to a church or are members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, 0.4% adhere to forms of Hinduism, and 9.0% follow other religions or did not give an answer to the survey. In addition, 8.2% of the population declared themselves to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot; and another 8% to be atheist.

===Education===
Kalmyk State University is the largest higher education facility in the republic.

==Economy==
Kalmykia has a developed agricultural sector. Other developed industries include the food processing and oil and gas industries.

As most of Kalmykia is arid, irrigation is necessary for agriculture. The Cherney Zemli Irrigation Scheme () in southern Kalmykia receives water from the Caucasian rivers Terek and Kuma via a chain of canals: water flows from the Terek to the Kuma via the Terek-Kuma Canal, then to the Chogray Reservoir on the East Manych River via the Kuma–Manych Canal, and finally into Kalmykia&#x27;s steppes over the Cherney Zemli Main Canal, constructed in the 1970s.

The government of Kalmykia spends about $100 million annually. Its annual oil production is about 1,270,000 barrels.

==Emigration and culture==
The Kalmyks of Kyrgyzstan live primarily in the Karakol region of eastern Kyrgyzstan. They are referred to as Sart Kalmyks. The origin of this name is unknown. Likewise, it is not known when, why and from where this small group of Kalmyks migrated to eastern Kyrgyzstan. Due to their minority status, the Sart Kalmyks have adopted the Kyrgyz language and culture of the majority Kyrgyz population.

Although many Sart Kalmyks are Muslims, Kalmyks elsewhere, by and large, remain faithful to the Gelugpa Order of Tibetan Buddhism. In Kalmykia, for example, the Gelugpa Order with the assistance of the government has constructed numerous Buddhist temples. In addition, the Kalmyk people recognize Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader and Erdne Ombadykow, a Kalmyk American, as the supreme lama of the Kalmyk people. The Dalai Lama has visited Elista on a number of occasions.

The Kalmyks have also established communities in the United States, primarily in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The majority are descended from those Kalmyks who fled from Russia in late 1920 to France, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and, later, Germany. Many of those Kalmyks living in Germany at the end of World War II were eventually granted passage to the United States.

As a consequence of their decades-long migration through Europe, many older Kalmyks are fluent in German, French, and Serbo-Croatian, in addition to Russian and their native Kalmyk language. There are several Kalmyk Buddhist temples in Monmouth County, New Jersey, where the vast majority of American Kalmyks reside, as well as a Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center and monastery in Washington Township, New Jersey. At one point during the 20th century, there was a Kalmyk Buddhist temple in Belgrade, Serbia.

The word &quot;Kalmyk&quot; means &#x27;those who remained&#x27;. Its origin is unknown but this name was known centuries before a large part of the Kalmyks moved back from the Volga River to Dzhungaria in the 18th century.

There are three cultural subgroups within the Kalmyk nation: &quot;Turguts&quot;, &quot;Durbets&quot; (Durwets), and &quot;Buzavs&quot; (Oirats, who joined the Russian Cossacks), as well as some villages of Hoshouts and Zungars. The Durbets subgroup includes the &quot;Chonos&quot; tribe (literally meaning &quot;a tribe of the wolf&quot;, also called &quot;Shonos&quot;, &quot;Chinos&quot;, &quot;A-Shino&quot;, or &quot;A-Chino&quot;).

Kalmykia staged the 2006 World Chess Championship between Veselin Topalov and Vladimir Kramnik.

Most of the Republic of Kalmykia lies in the Caspian Depression, a low-lying region down to below sea level.

<text>Robert August Varsha (born April 21, 1951) is an American broadcast journalist who specializes in covering motorsports. He is best known for being the lap-by-lap commentator for Formula 1 and CART series races for ESPN, ABC Sports, and Speed Channel among others.

==Early years==
Varsha was born in Northport, New York, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1973 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in foreign language. While attending Dartmouth, Varsha won varsity letters in cross country and track. He made the finals of the U.S. Olympic Trials marathon event twice, doing so while attending Emory University School of Law. Varsha won the inaugural Peach Bowl Half Marathon in 1980 at a time of 1:08:23.

Varsha practiced law in Atlanta, but his life took a different direction when TBS asked him to cover the Peachtree Road Race, which he headed as part of the Atlanta Track Club in 1980. He did so well that TBS offered him a part-time job. In 1986, Varsha joined ESPN, where he hosted the network&#x27;s Formula One coverage as well the CART, the 24 Hours of Le Mans and many other sports including gymnastics, figure skating and track &amp; field.

==Speed and Fox Broadcasting==

In 1999, Varsha moved to Speed, then known as SpeedVision. In 2002 and 2003, Varsha was the host of Speed&#x27;s Champ Car coverage. Rick DeBruhl took over Varsha&#x27;s Formula One host chair for that period. In 2004, Varsha returned to his Formula One hosting duties. In 2004, Varsha was also a part-time host/narrator for Speed&#x27;s coverage of the World Rally Championship, even reporting on-site from the WRC&#x27;s inaugural event in Mexico. Varsha also commentated on the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction on Speed Channel in Scottsdale, Arizona, Palm Beach, Florida, Orange County, California and Las Vegas, Nevada annually.

At the end of the 2012 Formula 1 season, it was announced that Speed and Fox would no longer present the entire live Formula 1 schedule for the United States market. Varsha, who was under contract to Speed, was quoted as saying that this merely represented &quot;one single apex in a life of innumerable apices.&quot; Varsha was the lead broadcaster for the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship on Fox Sports 1 &amp; Fox Sports 2 through the end of the 2016 season. He is also leader of the network&#x27;s FIA World Endurance Championship coverage, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Varsha was the original studio host for the Formula E series on Fox Sports. Starting in the 2016-17 season, he joined the world feed as a host and continued this role in the 2017-18 season.

==Other networks==
CBS &quot;borrowed&quot; Varsha and other talent from Speed when they broadcast Champ Car races in 2002 &amp; 2003.

Varsha was permitted by Fox to host three F1 races during the 2013 season for the NBC Sports Network (the three races that are on the same day as an IZOD IndyCar Series race (Malaysia, Belgium, and Korea) as regular lead host Leigh Diffey was also lead host on IndyCar broadcasts for NBCSN), which carried F1 in the United States until the end of 2017. In 2014, Varsha was again permitted to work with NBCSN&#x27;s coverage, but NBCSN decided instead to have Varsha be lead broadcaster for the Verizon IndyCar Series races instead of Formula 1, where Diffey remained lead broadcaster for the entire season. In 2014, Varsha worked Carb Day, Pocono, and the Toronto IndyCar race weekends.

Varsha called the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix on NBCSN with Steve Matchett and David Hobbs filling in for regular F1 announcer Leigh Diffey who was ill after he called the Olympics for NBC. Varsha also covered for Diffey on NBCSN&#x27;s coverage of the F1 Singapore Grand Prix on September 17, 2017, as Diffey was on assignment covering the IndyCar Series finale the same weekend.

==Radio==
In January 2002 Varsha joined Focus On Racing Radio, syndicated by Westwood One. The show originates from Memphis, Tennessee, but Varsha hosts from Atlanta, Georgia and from the Speed TV studios in Charlotte, North Carolina Varsha&#x27;s co-host on the show is Forrest Goodman of Memphis, Tennessee. The radio program is delivered in a magazine-style format and features interviews with top drivers from all forms of motorsports. The show&#x27;s slogan is &quot;The Fastest Hour In Radio!&quot;

Varsha was play-by-play radio announcer for the 2014 United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.

==Personal life==
Varsha&#x27;s son, Matt, drove in the Star Mazda Series for most of 2006, but had to withdraw near season&#x27;s end due to lack of financial backing.

In January 2020, Varsha revealed that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and would begin chemotherapy treatment.

<doc id="890931" wikidata="Q277710" url="?curid=890931" title="A+ (programming language)">
<text>A+ is a high-level, interactive, interpreted array programming language designed for numerically intensive applications, especially those found in financial applications.

== History ==

In 1985, Arthur Whitney created the A programming language to replace APL. Other developers at Morgan Stanley extended it to A+, adding a graphical user interface (GUI) and other language features. The GUI A+ was released in 1988.

Arthur Whitney went on to create a proprietary array language named K. Like J, K omits the APL character set. It lacks some of the perceived complexities of A+, such as the existence of statements and two different modes of syntax.

== Features ==

A+ provides an extended set of functions and operators, a graphical user interface with automatic synchronizing of widgets and variables, asynchronous executing of functions associated with variables and events, dynamic loading of user compiled subroutines, and other features. A+ runs on many Unix variants, including Linux. It is free and open source software released under a GNU General Public License. A newer GUI has not yet been ported to all supported platforms.

The A+ language implements the following changes to the APL language:
* an A+ function may have up to nine formal parameters
* A+ code statements are separated by semicolons, so a single statement may be divided into two or more physical lines
* The explicit result of a function or operator is the result of the last statement executed
* A+ implements an object called a dependency, which is a global variable (the dependent variable) and an associated definition that is like a function with no arguments. Values can be explicitly set and referenced in exactly the same ways as for a global variable, but they can also be set through the associated definition.

Interactive A+ development is primarily done in the Xemacs editor, through extensions to the editor. Because A+ code uses the original APL symbols, displaying A+ requires a font with those special characters; a font named &quot;kapl&quot; is provided on the web site for that purpose.

<doc id="890932" wikidata="Q7541703" url="?curid=890932" title="Slovene National Benefit Society">
<text>The Slovene National Benefit Society, known in Slovenian as Slovenska narodna podporna jednota, and by its Slovene initials S.N.P.J. is an fraternal benefit and social organization for Slovene immigrants and their descendants in the United States. Founded in 1904, it is headquartered in suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA near Imperial. SNPJ publishes a newspaper, &quot;Prosveta&quot;.

== Formation and growth ==

The SNPJ was formed in Chicago, Illinois on April 6, 1904, and held its first convention on April 9. The society was organized the result of a call in a Slovenian language newspaper for a new Slovenian benefit society. The founding twelve delegates represented nine independent Slovene groups with a total membership of 276. The organization was incorporated on June 17, 1907. The incorporation was delayed over a year because of an Illinois law which required fraternal benefit groups to have at least 500 members. In 1905 membership had grown to over 1,500 in 27 lodges. By only 1907 there were almost 4,300 members in 60 lodges. In 1917 the SNPJ, with 16,700 members in 360 lodges, had become the largest Slovene fraternal benefit society in the United States.

In the late 1960s the Society had 68,000 members. In 1979 it had 56,000 members in 350 lodges in twenty states.

In 1921, the SNPJ merged with the Slovene Workmen&#x27;s Benefit Society, or SDPZ, (which had previously absorbed the St. Barbara Lodge and the Slovene Labor Benefit and Pension Union). This merger gave the SNPJ over 36,000 members in 374 lodges. In 1941 the Slovenian Progressive Benefit Society (SSPZ) merged with the SNPJ. The Lily Alliance merged with SNPJ in 1947. Just over twenty years later, in 1969, the Slovene Independent Benefit Society merged with SNPJ. Thirty-two years after that merger, in 2001, the Workingmen&#x27;s Beneficial Society of Pittsburgh merged with SNPJ.

The first English speaking lodge, Pioneer Lodge 559 of Chicago, was chartered in 1925.

In 1961, all Canadian members were consolidated into a single lodge; in 1971 this lodge was transferred to the Croatian Fraternal Union.

The high point of individual memberships appears to have been in 1950, when SNPJ had 71,554 members. The high point of lodge membership appears to have been in 1946, when SNPJ was composed of 614 active lodges. 

In 1995 the SNPJ had 47,764 members.

As of 2002 there were 42,299 members in 170 lodges.

The Society was founded on a &quot;freethought&quot; basis. This was because many of the founders felt that existing Slovene organizations were too closely tied to the church.

== Organization ==

The local chapters of the Society are called &quot;Lodges&quot; and the supreme authority is the &quot;National Legislative Body&quot;, which meets quadrennially. Between conventions the Society is run by a &quot;National Board&quot;. In 1979 it was headquartered in Burr Ridge, Illinois, but now appears to have its central office in Imperial, Pennsylvania. The Lodges appear to be organized into numbered regions as well as local federations.

== Benefits ==
Originally the Society offered a death benefit of $500 to males, with a $1 flat rate assessment. However, by the 1970s, the Society was a legal reserve fund insurance group. The Society sponsors scholarships and operates a recreation center for its members, among other activities.

== Ritual ==

The Society has a ritual, but is not secret about it. The ritual included initiation rites, installation ceremonies for officers, an organizational pledge and burial rites. A prospective member must promise to be faithful to the Society&#x27;s constitution, defend the reputation of the lodges, and bring no harm to the organization.

<text>The naval Battle of Salamis in 306 BC took place off Salamis, Cyprus between the fleets of Ptolemy I of Egypt and Antigonus I Monophthalmus, two of the Diadochi, the generals who, after the death of Alexander the Great, fought each other for control of his empire.

Cyprus had been seized by Ptolemy, and was used as a base for operations against the Antigonid territories in Asia Minor and the Levant. In 306 BC, Antigonus sent his son Demetrius to invade the island, which was defended by Ptolemy&#x27;s brother Menelaus. After landing on the northeastern part of the island, Demetrius marched to Salamis, defeated Menelaus in a battle, and laid siege to the city. This was the first time where Demetrius demonstrated his flair for siege warfare, which would later earn him the sobriquet Poliorcetes, &quot;the Besieger&quot;. Nevertheless, Menelaus was able to hold off Demetrius&#x27; attacks until the arrival of reinforcements. Ptolemy led a large-scale rescue expedition in person, hoping to catch Demetrius between his own forces and those of Menelaus, sallying forth from Salamis. Demetrius took a calculated risk by leaving only a small force to impede Menelaus, and focusing the bulk of his forces against Ptolemy. The ensuing battle was a complete victory for Demetrius, who destroyed or captured much of Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet and army. After the battle, Menelaus and his men surrendered, and the rest of Cyprus was captured by Demetrius. In the wake of this victory, Antigonus assumed the royal title that had been vacant since the murder of Alexander&#x27;s underage son. This act influenced the other Diadochi to follow and imitate Antigonus and Demetrius. Quickly after the battle, most Diadochi had officially assumed the kingship.

The battle was a turning point in the Diadochic Wars and placed the Antigonids in a position of supremacy in the emerging Hellenistic world. In addition, the adoption of the royal title had a lasting impact on the Hellenistic period.

== Background==
During the wars of the Diadochi that followed the death of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy, who had seized control of Egypt, had taken over the island of Cyprus and used it as a base of operations against his rival Antigonus I Monophthalmus. From Cyprus, Ptolemy&#x27;s forces were able to raid the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor, territories controlled by Antigonus. In early 306 BC, Antigonus resolved to remove this threat, and ordered his son, Demetrius, to capture the island. Demetrius at the time was in Greece, where he had in the previous year overthrown the garrison installed in Athens by the ruler of Macedon, Cassander. The city, along with neighbouring Megara, was restored to democratic rule, and allied itself with Demetrius. As a result, when Demetrius sailed from Athens in spring 306 to capture Cyprus, he was accompanied by 30 Athenian quadriremes.

Crossing the Aegean, Demetrius made for the coast of Caria, whence he called upon the Rhodians to join him, per the terms of their alliance with his father. The Rhodians, however, who maintained good relations with Ptolemy, refused. Going on to Cilicia, where he was reinforced with more troops, Demetrius then crossed over to Cyprus with an army of 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. This was accompanied by a fleet numbering 53 heavy ships — 7 heptereis, 10 hexereis, 20 quinqueremes — and upwards of 110 lighter vessels—triremes and quadriremes — although the exact numbers are somewhat unclear. He was opposed by Ptolemy&#x27;s brother, Menelaus, who disposed of 12,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and 60 ships.

== Siege of Salamis and Ptolemy&#x27;s arrival in Cyprus ==

Demetrius landed on the Karpasia Peninsula on the northeast of the island and established a fortified encampment, protected by a palisade and a moat. From there he began raiding the area, and captured the towns of Karpasia and Urania. Leaving his fleet there, he then marched on land against the city of Salamis. Menelaus confronted Demetrius in battle some forty &quot;stadia&quot; (about five miles) from the city, but his army of 12,000 infantry and 800 cavalry were defeated in a brief battle with heavy loss (1,000 dead and 3,000 captured according to Diodorus Siculus) and had to retreat behind its walls. Demetrius freed the captives and enrolled them in his army, but soon they tried to defect, so Demetrius sent them to his father in Syria instead.

Following the battle, Menelaus hastily made ready for a siege of Salamis, mounting catapults on the walls, and sent messengers to his brother for aid. Demetrius also began preparations for the first of the sieges that would earn Demetrius his later nickname of &quot;Poliorcetes&quot; (&quot;the Besieger&quot;): skilled craftsmen and large quantities of wood and iron were brought from Asia to begin constructing large siege engines, including two large battering rams encased in large canopies to protect them from missiles, and a massive, nine-level mobile siege tower or helepolis, equipped with catapults and ballistae on each level, operated by a crew of over 200 men. Demetrius then brought his fleet and siege train into action and assaulted the city. After a few days, Demetrius&#x27; machines opened a breach in the wall and his subsequent assault nearly proved decisive, and was only stopped by nightfall. During the night, Menelaus gathered flammable material and was able to set the largest siege engines on fire.

In the meantime, in response to his brother&#x27;s appeals, Ptolemy himself had sailed from Alexandria at the head of his fleet. He arrived at Paphus, on the western coast of Cyprus, at the head of 140 warships, all quadriremes and quinqueremes, and of over 10,000 men on 200 transports. According to Plutarch, Ptolemy issued an ultimatum to Demetrius to leave Cyprus, while the latter countered with the offer that he would do so, if Ptolemy were to withdraw his garrisons from the cities of Sicyon and Corinth in Greece.

Ptolemy decided to try to make a night dash from Citium, round Cape Greko, to Salamis, hoping to surprise Demetrius and combine his fleet with his brother’s sixty ships so they could then outnumber Demetrius. Demetrius, however, informed of Ptolemy&#x27;s arrival, took steps in order to prevent this from happening: he equipped his ships with missile-throwers, brought aboard his best troops as marines, and sailed his fleet to anchor just outside the harbour of the city, bottling up Menelaus in the harbour and interposing himself between the two enemy fleets. This meant that Demetrius took a calculated risk that he would be able to defeat Ptolemy before Menelaus could sail out of the harbour and attack him in the rear.

== Naval combat before Salamis ==

As Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet came into view of the city right after dawn on the day of the battle, they found Demetrius&#x27; fleet deployed and waiting for them. His fleet augmented to some 180 vessels with ships captured in Cyprus, Demetrius concentrated the bulk against Ptolemy, leaving only 10 quinqueremes under Antisthenes to blockade the narrow exit of the harbour of Salamis and prevent or at least delay Menelaus&#x27; intervention. Demetrius had gathered his best ships—the seven Phoenician heptereis, the Athenian squadron, and behind them 10 hexereis and 10 quinqueremes—on the left, under command of the admiral Medius of Larissa. Medius was apparently the actual overall commander of the fleet, although Demetrius himself was also present on the left wing on his flagship, a hepteres. His centre comprised the lightest vessels in his fleet, under the command of Themison of Samos and Marsyas of Pella, while the right was entrusted to Hegesippus of Halicarnassus and Pleistias of Cos, the chief pilot (&quot;archikybernetes&quot;, the second-in-command after Medius) of the fleet. Ptolemy quickly matched his fleet to mirror his opponent&#x27;s dispositions: he ordered the transports carrying his army to fall back, and massed the largest ships of his fleet on his own left, which he commanded in person. As the historian Richard Billows writes, &quot;the battle was in effect a race to see which of the two dynasts could first defeat the enemy&#x27;s right wing and turn to attack the enemy&#x27;s center&quot;, with the &quot;added question of whether or not Menelaus would succeed in breaking out of Salamis in time to intervene&quot;.

According to Diodorus Siculus, who provides the fullest, and probably most reliable, account of the battle, when the two fleets were about three &quot;stadia&quot; apart, both Demetrius and Ptolemy raised the signal to attack (a gilded shield), and the two fleets charged each other. Diodorus describes the ramming and boarding actions, as well as the missile exchanges, that dominated the fight:

Demetrius himself won distinction for his bravery when Ptolemy&#x27;s men boarded his flagship, &quot;by hurling his javelins at some of them and by striking others at close range with his spear&quot;, despite being himself subject to &quot;many missiles of all sorts&quot;. Of his three bodyguards, who tried to protect him with their shields, one was killed and the others severely wounded. The Athenians also fought with distinction, as Demetrius awarded 1,200 suits of armour to Athens from the spoils taken. In the end, both left wings proved victorious, but it was Demetrius who won the race: by the time Ptolemy turned to attack Demetrius&#x27; centre, he found the rest of his fleet already defeated and in flight. Menelaus&#x27; 60 ships meanwhile, under the command of Menoetius, managed to break through Demetrius&#x27; blockade, only to find the battle already lost.

== Aftermath of the battle ==
Demetrius tasked Neon and Burichus with pursuing the defeated enemy and picking up the men from the sea, and returned in triumph to his camp. According to Diodorus, his fleet had only lost 20 damaged ships, all of which returned to service after repairs, while Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet had lost 80 ships. More importantly, Demetrius&#x27; forces had captured fully 40 of Ptolemy&#x27;s warships intact with their crews, as well as over a hundred of the transports with some 8,000 troops aboard. Plutarch goes further, claiming that Ptolemy managed to save only eight of his ships, and that 70 of Ptolemy&#x27;s ships were captured. Among the numerous prisoners taken by Demetrius was the courtesan Lamia of Athens, who later became the mistress of Demetrius, as well as Leontiscus, one of Ptolemy&#x27;s sons. Demetrius sent his flagship to Syria with Aristodemus of Miletus to report the victory to Antigonus.

Following his defeat, Ptolemy retreated to Egypt, and Menelaus was forced to surrender Salamis and its garrison, further increasing Demetrius&#x27; strength. Demetrius then moved to take over the rest of Cyprus, taking over the garrisons into his own army as well. According to Diodorus, the total strength added to his forces thus were 16,000 infantry and 800 cavalry. Despite their rivalry, the relationship between Ptolemy and Demetrius was characterized by a mutual respect and chivalrous conduct: after the Ptolemaic victory at Gaza in spring 312 BC Ptolemy had unconditionally released the captives and baggage train of Demetrius&#x27;, a gesture reciprocated by Demetrius after his success at Myus in the next year. Demetrius honoured this after Salamis as well, immediately releasing Menelaus and other relatives and friends of Ptolemy who had been captured with their personal possessions. When Ptolemy recaptured Cyprus in 295 BC, and found Demetrius&#x27; mother and children at Salamis, he again reciprocated by immediately releasing them.

== Impact ==
The victory at Salamis was used by Antigonus as a suitable pretext for his own proclamation as king (&quot;basileus&quot;), the Macedonian throne having lain vacant since the murder of Alexander IV of Macedon by Cassander in 309 BC. At the same time, Demetrius was raised to co-king alongside his father. Antigonus&#x27; assumption of the royal title was followed by an attempt to eliminate Ptolemy for good in a massive, but failed, invasion of Egypt in autumn 306, and then by the celebrated, but equally unsuccessful, Siege of Rhodes by Demetrius in 305–304 BC. Finally, in 302 BC the remaining dynasts—Ptolemy, Cassander, Seleucus, and Lysimachus—having in turn assumed the royal title themselves, allied against Antigonus and defeated him in the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus was killed, and his realm was broken up and divided among the victors. Demetrius survived the battle, and thanks to his large fleet managed to maintain control of a coastal and insular realm encompassing Cyprus, the Cyclades, Sidon, Tyre, Corinth, and the major cities of western Asia Minor. During the next years, Cyprus became a base of operations for Demetrius in the Levant, and for his imposition of control over Athens and southern Greece. During his absence in Greece, however, Ptolemy seized Cyprus in 295 BC.

The Battle of Salamis is proposed by modern scholars as one of three possible naval battles—along with the Battle of Amorgos (322 BC) and the Battle of Cos (261/255 BC)—that provided the occasion for the erection of the statue of the Nike of Samothrace.

<text>K is a proprietary array processing programming language developed by Arthur Whitney and commercialized by Kx Systems. The language serves as the foundation for kdb+, an in-memory, column-based database, and other related financial products. The language, originally developed in 1993, is a variant of APL and contains elements of Scheme. Advocates of the language emphasize its speed, facility in handling arrays, and expressive syntax.

== History ==
Before developing K, Arthur Whitney had worked extensively with APL, first at I. P. Sharp Associates alongside Ken Iverson and Roger Hui, and later at Morgan Stanley developing financial applications. At Morgan Stanley, Whitney helped to develop A+, a variant of APL, to facilitate migrating APL applications from IBM mainframe computers to a network of Sun workstations. A+ had a smaller set of primitive functions and was designed for speed and to handle large sets of time series data.

In 1993, Whitney left Morgan Stanley and developed the first version of the K language. At the same time he formed Kx Systems to commercialize the product and signed an exclusive contract with Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS). For the next four years he developed various financial and trading applications using K for UBS.

The contract ended in 1997 when UBS merged with Swiss Bank. In 1998, Kx Systems released kdb+, a database built on K. kdb was an in-memory, column-oriented database and included ksql, a query language with an SQL-like syntax. Since then, several financial products have been developed with K and kdb+. kdb+/tick and kdb+/taq were developed in 2001. kdb+, a 64-bit version of kdb+ was released in 2003 and kdb+/tick and kdb+/taq were released in 2004. kdb+ included Q, a language that merged the functions of the underlying K language and ksql.

Whitney released a derivative of K called Shakti in 2018.

== Overview ==
K shares key features with APL. They are both interpreted, interactive languages noted for concise and expressive syntax. They have simple rules of precedence based on right to left evaluation. The languages contain a rich set of primitive functions designed for processing arrays. These primitive functions include mathematical operations that work on arrays as whole data objects, and array operations, such as sorting or reversing the order of an array. In addition, the language contains special operators that combine with primitive functions to perform types of iteration and recursion. As a result, complex and extended transformations of a dataset can be expressed as a chain of sub-expressions, with each link performing a segment of the calculation and passing the results to the next link in the chain.

Like APL, the primitive functions and operators are represented by single or double characters; however, unlike APL, K restricts itself to the ASCII character set (as does another APL variant, J). To allow for this, the set of primitive functions for K is smaller and heavily overloaded, with each of the ASCII symbols representing two or more distinct functions or operations. In a given expression, the actual function referenced is determined by the context. As a result, K expressions can be opaque and difficult to parse for humans. For example, in the following contrived expression the exclamation point codice_1 refers to three distinct functions:

Reading from right to left the first codice_1 is modulo division that is performed on 7 and 4 resulting in 3. The next codice_1 is enumeration and lists the integers less than 3, resulting in the list 0 1 2. The final codice_1 is rotation where the list on the right is rotated two times to the left producing the final result of 2 0 1.

The second core distinction of K is that functions are first-class objects, a concept borrowed from Scheme. First-class functions can be used in the same contexts where a data value can be used. Functions can be specified as anonymous expressions and used directly with other expressions. Function expressions are specified in K using curly brackets. For example, in the following expression a quadratic expression is defined as a function and applied to the values 0 1 2 and 3:
{(3*x^2)+(2*x)+1}&#x27;!4
In K, named functions are simply function expressions stored to a variable in the same way any data value is stored to a variable.
a:25
f:{(x^2)-1}

Functions can be passed as an argument to another function or returned as a result from a function.

== Examples ==
K is an interpreted language where every statement is evaluated and its results displayed immediately. Literal expressions such as strings evaluate to themselves. Consequently, the Hello world-program is trivial:

The following expression sorts a list of strings by their lengths:

x@&gt;#:&#x27;x

The expression is evaluated from right to left as follows:
# #:&#x27;x returns the length of each word in the list x.
# &gt; returns the indices that would sort a list of values in descending order.
# @ uses the integer values on the right to index into the original list of strings.

A function to determine if a number is prime can be written as:

{&amp;/x!/:2_!x}

The function is evaluated from right to left:
# !x enumerate the positive integers less than x.
# 2_ drops the first two elements of the enumeration (0 and 1).
# x!/: performs modulo division between the original integer and each value in the truncated list.
# &amp;/ find the minimum value of the list of modulo result.
If x is not prime then one of the values returned by the modulo operation will be 0 and consequently the minimal value of the list. If x is prime then the minimal value will be 1, because x mod 2 is 1 for any prime greater than 2.

The function below can be used to list all of the prime numbers between 1 and R with:

2_&amp;{&amp;/x!/:2_!x}&#x27;!R

The expression is evaluated from right to left
# !R enumerate the integers less than R.
# &#x27; apply each value of the enumeration to the prime number function on the left. This will return a list of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s.
# &amp; return the indices of the list where the value is 1.
# 2_ drop the first two elements of the enumeration (0 and 1)

==K financial products==
K is the foundation for a family of financial products. Kdb+ is an in-memory, column-based database with much of the same functions of a relational database management system. The database supports SQL, SQL-92 and ksql, a query language with a syntax similar to SQL and designed for column based queries and array analysis.

Kdb+ is available for several operating systems, including Solaris, Linux, macOS, and Windows (32-bit or 64-bit).

<doc id="890957" wikidata="Q1544932" url="?curid=890957" title="Greg Johnson (ice hockey)">
<text>Gregory C. Johnson (March 16, 1971 – July 7, 2019) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks, and Nashville Predators.

In over 700 career NHL games, Johnson earned 350 points from 134 goals and 216 assists. His best season was in 1998–99 where he achieved 16 goals and 34 assists.

==Playing career==

===Amateur===
Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Johnson recorded 96 points in 47 games for the local Thunder Bay Flyers of the USHL in 1988–89.

Johnson played four years at the University of North Dakota where he led the WCHA in assists twice and was placed on the conference First All-Star Team three straight years from 1991 to 1993. He was also placed on the NCAA West First All-American Team in 1991 and 1993 and the Second Team in 1992.

===Professional===
Johnson was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers as the 33rd pick in the second round of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, but never played for the organization. On June 20, 1993, he was traded from the Flyers with future considerations to the Detroit Red Wings for Jim Cummins and a fourth round pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. Red Wings head coach and general manager Bryan Murray specifically targeted Johnson as a skilled center whom the Wings could develop.

Johnson spent parts of four seasons with the Red Wings from 1993 to 1997. On January 27, 1997, Johnson was traded by the Red Wings to the Pittsburgh Penguins for winger Tomas Sandstrom. The Wings, who were looking to add a more physical element and had depth down the middle, traded from a position of strength by sending the skilled center for the rugged veteran forward. The move paid off for the Wings, as they went on to win the 1996-97 Stanley Cup.

Johnson played the rest of the 1996–97 season and part of the 1997–98 season with the Penguins before being traded to the Blackhawks for Tuomas Gronman on October 22, 1997.

Johnson was the 23rd pick of the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft by the Predators from the Blackhawks. He would go on to spend the final seven years of his career with the team. Johnson was the second captain in Nashville Predators history, and served in that capacity from 2002 until 2006. He had previously served as an alternate captain from 1999 to 2002.

Johnson became part of an anomaly during the 2005–06 season when he was credited with scoring a goal &quot;before&quot; the start of a game against the Detroit Red Wings. On November 21, 2005, he scored a goal during the first period of a game that was eventually postponed after Red Wings defender Jiri Fischer suffered a cardiac arrest. The game was replayed on January 23, 2006, and, while the full game was replayed, Johnson&#x27;s goal was allowed to stand, thus giving Nashville a 1–0 lead before the opening faceoff.

On August 14, 2006, Johnson signed a one-year contract to rejoin his former team, the Detroit Red Wings. In September 2006, during a routine preseason physical, an EKG test returned abnormal results. Johnson had further testing, and eventually decided to retire before training camp.

==International play==
Johnson earned a silver medal representing Canada at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics. He also played for the Canadian National Team in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons.

==Personal life==
Johnson&#x27;s brother Ryan was also a professional hockey player, playing for five teams over a fifteen-year NHL career.

On July 7, 2019, Johnson&#x27;s wife Kristin found him dead in the basement of their Detroit home. No cause of death has been given, but police reports concluded that it was suicide by firearm. Johnson was 48 and survived by his wife and their two daughters.

On July 10, 2024, five years after his death, it was announced Johnson was posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

<doc id="890960" wikidata="Q629990" url="?curid=890960" title="Bireme">
<text>A bireme (, ) is an ancient oared warship (galley) with two superimposed rows of oars on each side. Biremes were long vessels built for military purposes and could achieve relatively high speed. They were invented well before the 6th century BC and were used by the Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Greeks.

==Description==

The name bireme comes from &quot;bi-&quot; meaning two and &quot;-reme&quot; meaning oar.

It was typically about long with a maximum beam width of around . It was modified from the penteconter, a ship that had only one set of oars on each side, the bireme having two sets of oars on each side. The bireme was twice the triaconter&#x27;s length and height, and thus employed 120 rowers. Biremes were galleys, galleasses, dromons, and small pleasure crafts called pamphyles.

The next development, the trireme, keeping the length of the bireme, added a tier to the height, the rowers being thus increased to 180. It also had a large square sail.

==Uses==
These ships were frequently used by the Romans, as during the second of Caesar&#x27;s invasions of Britain. The bireme eventually evolved into the trireme. A unit commandant (who was given a tent on the open deck) directed a group of marines. The bireme was also recorded in ancient history on the 8th and early 7th-century BC Assyrian reliefs, where they were used to carry out an amphibious attack on the coast of Elam and the lagoons of the Persian Gulf during the reign of Sennacherib.

Medieval galleys are also described as &quot;bireme&quot; or &quot;trireme&quot; depending on the number of their banks of oars. The terminology can lead to confusion, since the terms are also used for rowed warships of the Greco-Roman period built on entirely different design principles.

==Dimensions and development==
In 1275, Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily, issued an order for the construction of several galleys that provide the earliest evidence for the dimensions of the bireme galleys. Because of increased weight and breadth, which brought increased friction through the water, a trireme galley was not dramatically faster than a bireme. But the change to trireme produced more significant developments than a gain in tactical speed over short distances. Early bireme galleys escorted merchant ships but were rarely used to carry goods. A few Genoese freight contracts of the mid-13th century record charters for bireme galleys.

<text>Taylor William Pyatt (born August 19, 1981) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Buffalo Sabres, Vancouver Canucks, Phoenix Coyotes, New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. Drafted from the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), he played major junior hockey with the Sudbury Wolves.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Pyatt played three seasons with the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). After scoring 75 points in 68 games in his second OHL season, Pyatt was selected eighth overall in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Islanders. The next season, his third and final with Sudbury, Pyatt scored 89 points in 68 games, earning OHL First All-Star Team honours.

===New York Islanders and Buffalo Sabres===
In 2000–01, Pyatt made the final cut out of the Islanders&#x27; training camp as the only player with no prior NHL experience. On November 27, 2000, he scored his first NHL goal, against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After Pyatt&#x27;s rookie season, during which he scored 18 points in 78 games, the Islanders traded him to the Buffalo Sabres (along with Tim Connolly) in exchange for Frank J. Selke Trophy winner Michael Peca in a draft-day trade.

During the 2004–05 lockout, Pyatt went overseas to play for Hammarby IF of the Swedish HockeyAllsvenskan.

===Vancouver Canucks===
After four seasons with Buffalo, on July 14, 2006, Pyatt was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft (later traded by Buffalo to the Calgary Flames). Pyatt benefitted from playing on the Canucks&#x27; top line with twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin, leading to career highs in goals and points, with 23 and 37 respectively.
During the 2007–08 season, on January 13, 2008, Pyatt took a stick to the face. Getting in the way of an Eric Brewer clearing attempt in a game against the St. Louis Blues, he required 25 stitches in his upper lip and a splint in his mouth to hold up his teeth. He wore a full face shield upon his return to the lineup and elected to wear a visor for the remainder of his Vancouver tenure. Despite being taken off the Canucks&#x27; top line with the Sedins during the season, Pyatt completed the campaign matching his career-high of 37 points, as well as setting a new career mark for assists with 21. The next season, in 2008–09, Pyatt was sidelined for eight games due to a foot injury suffered on December 17, 2008. Following an injury to Pavol Demitra during the 2009 playoffs, Pyatt made his return to the lineup on May 5 for Game 3 of the second round against the Chicago Blackhawks. Following the Canucks&#x27; second round elimination, it was revealed Pyatt required off-season surgery to his knee.

===Phoenix Coyotes===
After not being re-signed by the Canucks, Pyatt became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2009. Two months later, he signed a one-year, $600,000 contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. Going into his first season with the Coyotes, Pyatt suffered a lower body injury during training camp and missed the team&#x27;s first five regular season games. One month after returning to the Coyotes&#x27; lineup, he and younger brother Tom Pyatt of the Montreal Canadiens played against each other for the first time in their careers. On December 23, 2009, as the Coyotes played their final game before the NHL Christmas break against the Anaheim Ducks, Pyatt scored the second goal of the game, his 200th career NHL point. Near the end of the regular season, Pyatt recorded a Gordie Howe hat trick against the Colorado Avalanche after scoring a goal, recording an assist and engaging in a fight. The Coyotes defeated the Avalanche 6–2 and clinched their first playoff berth in seven seasons. Pyatt finished the regular season with 12 goals and 23 points in 74 games played. In the playoffs, he scored one goal and recorded one assist as the Coyotes were eliminated in the Western Conference Quarterfinals by the Detroit Red Wings in seven games.

On June 21, 2010, Pyatt signed a two-year, $2 million contract extension with Phoenix, avoiding unrestricted free agency. In his second season with the Coyotes, Pyatt began scoring more frequently than in his previous season. However, on December 20, 2010, in a 6–1 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins, Pyatt suffered an upper body injury during a fight with Penguins enforcer Deryk Engelland and was subsequently placed on the Coyotes&#x27; injured reserve list. After missing four games, he returned to the lineup for the Coyotes&#x27; New Year&#x27;s Eve game against the St. Louis Blues.

===New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins===
On July 3, 2012, Pyatt signed with the New York Rangers on a two-year, $3.1 million contract. In the final year of his contract with the Rangers on January 2, 2014, Pyatt was claimed off of waivers by the Pittsburgh Penguins. He scored his first goal with the Penguins on January 15, 2014, against the Washington Capitals. He would add three more goals during the remainder of the season. He did not play in the 2014 playoffs.

===Switzerland and retirement===
On July 24, 2014, with indication of little NHL interest, Pyatt agreed to a one-year free agent contract with Swiss team Genève-Servette HC of the National League A. For the first time in his career, Pyatt played alongside brother Tom Pyatt with Genève-Servette.

After one season in Switzerland, his 15th professional season, Pyatt retired from professional hockey.

==Personal life==
Pyatt is one of three sons of Kathie and former NHL player Nelson Pyatt. His younger brother by six years, Tom Pyatt, was also a professional ice hockey player.

<doc id="890978" wikidata="Q755230" url="?curid=890978" title="Athena, Phevos and Proteas">
<text>Athena and Phevos (; pronounced and were the official mascots of the 2004 Summer Olympics and Proteas (, ) was the official mascot of the 2004 Summer Paralympics, both held in Athens, Greece.

Athena and Phevos are one of the few examples of anthropomorphic mascots in the history of the Olympics. According to the official mascot webpage, &quot;their creation was inspired by an ancient Greek doll and their names are linked to ancient Greece, yet the two siblings are children of modern times - Athena and Phevos represent the link between Greek history and the modern Olympic Games.&quot;

The Athens 2004 Olympic Organizing Committee claimed that the mascots represented &quot;participation, brotherhood, equality, cooperation, fair play [and] the everlasting Greek value of human scale.&quot;

For the Paralympic Games, ATHOC subsequently requested Gogos for the creation of a new mascot along the creative lines of Athena and Phevos. He created Proteas, a seahorse that is to convey the nature of the competitions and the athletes’ constant goal of achieving excellency.

The mascots have been emblazoned on a variety of items for sale, including pins, clothing and other memorabilia.

==History==

An international competition for the design of the Olympic mascots was launched by the Athens Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (ATHOC) on 26 February 2001: on 18 May 2001, ATHOC shortlisted seven proposals out of the 127 entries that met the initial requirements. The winning proposal, submitted by Spyros Gogos of Paragraph Design Limited, was announced on 26 October 2001.

==Design==
The mascots were named after the Greek gods Athena and Apollo, &quot;Phevos&quot; being a transcription of the modern Greek pronunciation of &quot;Phoebus&quot;, an epithet of Apollo. They were loosely modeled after an archaic Greek terra cotta &quot;daidala&quot; from the 7th century BC, which was recommended by curators at the National Archaeological Museum.

==Controversy==

Prior to the Games, a group affiliated with the &quot;Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum&quot; called the Greek Society of the Friends of the Ancients and a Hellenic polytheistic group called the &quot;Committee for the Greek Religion Dodecatheon&quot;, devoted to the preservation of ancient Greek culture, sued over the mascots, claiming that they &quot;savagely insult&quot; Classical Greek culture. In a BBC Radio interview on June 26, 2004, Dr. Pan. Marinis, President of the Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum, said that the mascots:

&quot;mock the spiritual values of the Hellenic Civilization by degrading these same holy personalities that were revered during the ancient Olympic Games. For these reasons we have proceeded to legal action demanding the punishment of those responsible.&quot;

The fact that the organizing committee referred to the &quot;daidala&quot; as dolls has been the cause of some controversy among scholars of Ancient Greek culture, as the &quot;daidala&quot; were religious artifacts.

<text>Lovosice (; ) is a town in Litoměřice District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 8,800 inhabitants. It is an industrial town.

==Geography==
Lovosice is located about southwest of Litoměřice and south of Ústí nad Labem. It lies mostly in the Lower Ohře Table. A small northwestern part of the municipal territory extends into the Central Bohemian Uplands and includes the highest point of Lovosice, which is a contour line at the foot of the Lovoš mountain at above sea level. The town is situated on the left bank of the Elbe River, which forms the northern municipal border.

==History==

The region of Lovosice was inhabited already in the Bronze Age. Some evidence indicates that the first Czechs lived right here.

The first mention of Lovosice is from 1143. Duke Vladislaus II gave this small village to the Strahov monastery. Emperor Rudolf II promoted the village to a town in 1600.

Lovosice was 1756 the site of a major battle between Prussia and the Austrian empire, at the Battle of Lobositz. 

In 1850, the railroad was built, which supported the industrialization of the town and accelerated development.

During World War II, due to the Munich Agreement, Lovosice fell within a German occupation zone, commonly called Sudetenland. Only 600 Czechs stayed in the town at that time. After the war, the German population was expelled as a result of the Beneš decrees.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Lovosice is known as an industrial town with a long tradition of chemical and food-processing industries.

==Transport==
Lovosice is a significant transport junction. Besides a cargo port on the Elbe River, the town has a great connection to Prague and Germany via the D8 motorway.

Lovosice is located on the railway lines Prague–Děčín and Litoměřice–Chotiměř. The town is served by three train stations.

==Sights==

The former town hall is one of the most valuable buildings in the town. It was built in the Art Nouveau style in 1906–1907. Today it serves as a library and tourist information office.

The Renaissance castle in Lovosice was built in the second half of the 16th century. After a fire in 1809, it was modified in the Baroque style and served as an archive and office. Today the building houses a secondary vocational school.

The Church of Saint Wenceslaus was built in the Baroque style in 1733–1748, on the site of the former wooden church. It contains valuable frescoes and a Saint Wenceslaus altarpiece.

<text>The Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) was an early men&#x27;s amateur hockey league founded in 1898, replacing the organization that was formerly the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) before the 1898–99 season. The league existed for seven seasons, folding in 1905 and was itself replaced by the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). Formed because of a dispute between teams of the AHAC, it further developed the sport in its transition to professional, with a growing focus on revenues. The CAHL itself would fold over a dispute, leading to the new ECAHA league.

==History==
===Founding===

The annual meeting of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) was held in Montreal on December 10, 1898, and was reported as &quot;a cataclysm in the hockey world.&quot;

At the previous year&#x27;s meeting, the application of the Ottawa Capitals to join was declined. In 1898, the Capitals had won the intermediate championship and applied again for AHAC membership. The AHAC executive then voted in favor of admitting the Capitals for league membership. This led to the representatives of the Quebec, Montreal Victorias and Ottawa clubs opting to withdraw from the association. The representative of the Montreal Hockey Club asked the group to reconsider but was declined, after which point Montreal also withdrew.

The withdrawing teams then met at the Windsor Hotel the same day. A representative of the McGill University also attended on the possibility that McGill would join. On December 14, the group met again and organized the CAHL, adding also the Montreal Shamrocks and not McGill. The new league adopted the existing constitution of the AHAC.

The following executive committee was formed:
* H. Wilson, (president)
* A. E. Swift, Quebec (1st. vice-president)
* E. P. Murphy, (2nd. vice-president)
* George Jones, (secretary-treasurer)

===Hockey net===

Almost lost in the shuffle of the dissolution of AHAC and the founding of the CAHL was the first use of netting for the goals. Proposed by the Quebec team, a rope was used to connect the tops of the existing goal posts. Attached to the rope and the posts was netting in a pocket, to catch any pucks that entered the net. Nets had been in use for the goals in lacrosse and ice polo. The nets became a permanent part of the CAHL rinks after an exhibition series in 1899.

===Final season===
The league would stay with the same five teams until the 1904 season. During the season, Ottawa withdrew from the league in a dispute with the league. The league continued its schedule with the remaining four teams. The following season, the league admitted the Montreal Le National and Montreal Westmount clubs in place of Ottawa, which joined the Federal Amateur Hockey League. It would be the final season of the league, as in the off-season the Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa would form the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association and absorb the teams of the CAHL.

<doc id="890994" wikidata="Q211844" url="?curid=890994" title="Palm Islands">
<text>The Palm Islands consist of three artificial archipelagos: Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Islands (formerly known as Palm Deira or Deira Islands), and Palm Jebel Ali, on the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The Palm Islands were constructed around the same time as The World Islands. Nakheel Properties is the Palm Islands real estate developer. The creation of the islands began in 2001 and ended around 2006/2007. These islands have significantly impacted ocean sediment and wildlife in the surrounding area.

==Islands==
===Current projects===

Palm Jumeirah () is the site of numerous private residences and hotels. From the air, the archipelago resembles a stylized palm tree within a circle. Construction began in 2001 and was financed mainly by Dubai&#x27;s petroleum income. By 2009, 28 hotels had opened on the site. The opening ceremony of the Palm Jumeirah was held in 2010. The Atlantis and Atlantis The Royal Residences are the largest hotels currently constructed on Palm Jumeirah. The island has a population of over 18,000 people as of 2015.

Palm Jebel Ali () is an artificial archipelago that features a palm tree that is 50% larger than the Palm Jumeirah. Located near the southernmost Jebel Ali locality, The island has a larger crescent shape. Space has been created between the crescent and the tree to build boardwalks that encircle the &quot;fronds&quot; of the &quot;palm&quot; and spell out an Arabic poem written by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. After a subsequent redesign that scrapped the poem boardwalks, construction on the island began in 2001 but was halted due to the Global financial crisis. After 11 years of being dormant, the project was restarted in 2024 and will be completed in 2028.

Dubai Islands () are four undeveloped artificial islands off the coast of Deira, the northernmost locality in Dubai. As of 2025, little development has occurred on the islands. At first, the project, which was supposed to be a part of the Palm Islands, was known as Palm Deira. It was intended to be the biggest palm of the three, roughly eight times as big as the Palm Jumeirah. After the recession, it was scaled down to Deira Islands which utilized only the islands that were already built. However, this too was halted until Nakheel rebranded and relaunched it as Dubai Islands in 2024. The project will resume construction but an opening date has not been specified.

The World Islands are an archipelago of 300 small artificial islands constructed in the shape of a world map, located in the Persian Gulf, off the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The World Islands are composed mainly of sand dredged from Dubai&#x27;s shallow coastal waters. Construction of the 300 islands began in 2003, before being halted due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Though 60% of the islands were sold to private contractors in 2008, development on most of the projects has not started. As of July 2012, Lebanon Island was completed and was the only island that had so far been developed commercially, being used for private corporate events and public parties. As of late 2013, only two of the islands had been developed. In January 2014, Kleindienst Group announced the launch of &quot;the Heart of Europe&quot; project. As of 2025, the project will resume construction but an opening date has not been specified.

===Cancelled projects===
Dubai Waterfront was expected to become the largest waterfront and largest man-made development in the world. The project was a conglomeration of canals and an artificial archipelago; it would occupy the last remaining Persian Gulf coastline of Dubai, right next to Palm Jebel Ali and the Dubai-Abu Dhabi border. It was planned to consist of a series of zones with mixed-use including commercial, residential, resort, and amenity areas, with its longest canal, stretching from the base of the Waterfront to Palm Jumeirah, circling the Al Maktoum International Airport. The artificial islands would be formed to resemble the most widely recognized symbol of Islam, the star and crescent. This would produce a shelter around the Palm Jebel Ali. It was later redesigned without the Islamic design, and due to the financial crisis, the project was stalled. With 40% of the islands already constructed, the project was cancelled.

The Universe was a planned artificial archipelago in the shape of the Sun, Moon, Milky Way and Solar System, to be built on the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The Universe was to be located between the Palm Jumeirah and the World. The project plan was put on hold indefinitely in 2009 and later removed from the developer&#x27;s website.

== Purpose ==
Nakheel built the Palm Islands to increase the coastline for tourists. Dubai is known for its sunny weather and beaches, but more than 72 km (45 miles) of coastline was needed to accommodate the goal of tripling the number of tourists to 15 million annually. The solution was to construct a massive island shaped like a palm tree, which, upon completion in 2006, would add 56 km (35 miles) to the coastline. The island is designed to be a city within itself, featuring shopping centers, restaurants, hotels, and residential properties.

==Construction==
Palm Jumeirah was built entirely from sand and rocks; no concrete or steel was used to build the island. This was done following the order of the Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who came up with the idea for Palm Islands and the design.

===Resources involved===
*5.5 million cubic meters of rock were brought from over 16 quarries in Dubai.
*94 million cubic meters of sand brought from deep sea beds 6  nautical miles from the coast of Dubai.
*700 tons of limestone.

===Obstacles and risks===
*Erosion caused by wind and water currents is one of the biggest problems, as erosion is stripping away the sand that forms most of the island. This results in loss of coastal shape along the seashores.
*Damage to the Marine ecology (for example, the loss of reefs and fish), including disturbances in the reproductive cycles of the species of fish that were close to the shores of Dubai. Research conducted by marine biologists on this phenomenon showed that the newly born fish could not survive in conditions along the shores of Dubai due to constant construction and environmental alterations (for example, shifting of sand, moving boulders, and the effects of the vibrations).
*Waves up to two meters high, as well as annual or biennial storms.
*Sinking, as well as weak soil due to constant exposure to the rising seawater.
*Water pollution.

Installation of utilities and pipelines was complicated and required a lot of labour.

===Risk mitigation===
To counteract the waves and constant motion of the sea, breakwaters were built around the island. They are 3 meters high and 160 km in total length. Expanded over a length of about 11.5 km, the base of these breakwaters and the island itself were constantly monitored during the construction process with the help of deep-sea divers. The divers checked the alignment and placement of the rocks beneath the surface to ensure their stability. The shape of the island was monitored using the global positioning system.

The sand on top of the island was sprayed by a technique called rainbowing. The whole island was planned to have no stagnant water between the island and the breakwaters. To achieve this, small structural modifications were made to the breakwaters surrounding the island, allowing the seawater to move through the breakers without causing any damage to the island. To prevent erosion of the sand from the island, maintenance systems spray material along the coast of the island and also along the coast of Dubai.

A vibro-compaction technique was used to prevent the process of liquefaction. This was done to hold the island&#x27;s base together and to make a strong foundation for further construction.

==Environmental concerns==
The construction of the Palm Islands along the coast of Dubai has had a significant impact on the surrounding environment, resulting in changes to area wildlife (especially aquatic life), coastal erosion, alongshore sediment transport, and wave patterns.

The origin of most of the environmental damage stems from disturbed sediment from the construction of the Palm Island. The sediment decreased the amount of sunlight filtering down to the sea vegetation and injured the surrounding marine fauna. Environmental disturbances caused by changes in sediment and coastal erosion have attracted the attention of environmental groups such as Greenpeace, who criticized the Palm Islands for the lack of sustainability.

The non-profit environmental news service Mongabay has reported on Dubai&#x27;s artificial islands, stating that:

In 2006, the World Wildlife Fund announced, &quot;[The] UAE&#x27;s human pressure on global ecosystems (its ecological footprint) [is] the highest in the world. The country is supposedly at present five times more unsustainable than any other country&quot; (Samarai, 2007). It also mentioned that the construction from the start-up to date had caused many visible ecological and environmental changes that threatened the future.

===Geophysical effects===
According to a study published in the journal &quot;Water&quot; in 2022, the construction of Palm Jumeirah Island has increased water-soluble materials, changed the water&#x27;s spectral profile, and increased the water surface temperature around the island.

Variations in alongshore sediment transport have resulted in changes in erosion patterns along the UAE coast, which has also been exacerbated by altered wave patterns as the waters of the Persian Gulf attempt to move around the new obstruction of the islands. The rock walls constructed around the palm islands can result in different wave patterns along the coast of Dubai. Instead of hitting the shores directly, the waves move unusually around the new obstruction. This has led to the weakening of the shores of Dubai.

==Coastal protection==
To properly manage their shorelines and effects, Dubai relies on its coastal monitoring program. Established in 1997, the Dubai Coastal Monitoring program began studying the baseline bathymetric (measurement of the depth of water in oceans or seas) and topographic survey of the Jumeirah (Dubai) coastline.

Additional data was collected with technological improvements, including remote video monitoring of Dubai beaches, sediment sampling and analysis, near-shore directional wave and current recordings, and intensive measurement exercises at selected locations using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) equipment. Because of this, they can constantly monitor the continuously changing environmental conditions along the coast of Dubai.

In 2018, many rumours were abuzz that Palm Jumeirah and The World were sinking into the water. However, Nakheel claims that this is false.

<doc id="890995" wikidata="Q2160784" url="?curid=890995" title="Rockville Bridge">
<text>The Rockville Bridge is the longest stone masonry arch railroad viaduct ever built, at . It has 48 70-foot spans.

The bridge crosses the Susquehanna River about north of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The eastern end is located in Rockville and the western end is just south of Marysville.

Completed in 1902 by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), it remains in use today by the Norfolk Southern Railway and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; route.

The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1979.

==History==
The first bridge erected at this site was a one-track wooden truss built by the PRR and opened on September 1, 1849. The Northern Central Railway began to use it after abandoning its Marysville Bridge.

It was replaced in 1877 with a double-track iron truss bridge.

The third and current bridge was built between April 1900 and March 1902 by Drake &amp; Stratton Co., which erected the eastern half, and H.S. Kerbaugh, working from the west. The laborers included men of Italian heritage and local residents.

Control of the bridge passed to Penn Central after the PRR merger in 1968, then to Conrail and finally the Norfolk Southern.

For most of its life, the bridge carried four main line tracks, which were reduced to three during the 1980s when the former PRR Main Line was modernized across Pennsylvania.

In the late 1990s, an intermodal container was blown off an intermodal freight train and landed in the river, prompting Norfolk Southern to stop using the wye track to Enola at the west end of the bridge. This reduced the number of main line tracks to two, but left a buffer zone on either side to prevent further containers ending up in the river, although high winds from the departing December 2010 North American blizzard sent another overboard on December 27, 2010.

The track from the west side of the bridge was shortened to a new control point named &quot;Mary&quot; because the curve in the switch at the former location caused lateral forces to blow out the side of the spandrel. This led to the failure of the downriver side under the weight of a coal train. When the spandrel failed, it also disproved the once-popular thought that the core of the bridge was filled with concrete.

During times of high wind, it is routine to park heavy trains on the bridge as a wind shield.

Currently, the bridge is used by the Norfolk Southern Railway and Amtrak.

<text>Wild Kingdom, also known as Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom, is an American documentary television program that features wildlife and nature. It was originally produced from 1963 until 1988, and was revived in 2002. The show&#x27;s second incarnation aired until 2011 on Animal Planet in the United States. A third incarnation streamed webisodes on a dedicated YouTube channel from 2013 to 2018. Starting April 4, 2021, the program will be shown in its traditional Sunday timeslot on the cable channel RFD-TV. A fourth incarnation, &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom Protecting the Wild&quot;, hosted by Peter Gros &amp; Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant, premiered on NBC as part of the network&#x27;s Saturday morning &quot;The More You Know&quot; educational and informational programming block in October 2023.

==Overview of original program==
The original &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; grew from discussions that started in 1962 between zoologist Marlin Perkins and V. J. Skutt, the chairman and CEO of insurance company Mutual of Omaha. The company had been the sponsor of an earlier animal-related show, &quot;Zoo Parade&quot;, that Perkins had hosted from 1952 until 1957. Also intimately involved with the creation of &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; was &quot;Zoo Parade&quot; producer Don Meier, who was credited as the program&#x27;s creator. Mutual of Omaha sponsored and lent its name to the new program.

&quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; won Emmy Awards for &quot;outstanding program achievement&quot; in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969.

Liz and Henk Maartens, from Irene, Pretoria, South Africa, won five Emmy Awards for the documentary program &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; in 1970. One Emmy Award was for camerawork, while the other Emmy Awards were for aspects of production.

&quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; was first broadcast by NBC. The half-hour show aired on Sundays starting January 6, 1963, and continued until 1971, when the program entered first-run syndication. As a prime-time syndicated program, &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; enjoyed great popularity. Although most of the programs aired after 1971 were repeats, new shows continued to be produced until 1987. After syndication in 1971, the show received 41 major achievements. Some awards include the four Emmys from the National Academy of Arts and Sciences and the First Annual Communications Award from the National Wildlife Association. S Several episodes were filmed by cameraman Roy Pinney. Perkins was the host for most of the show&#x27;s history until he was forced to retire in 1985 for health reasons, and Jim Fowler, Perkins&#x27; long-time assistant and sidekick, became the host.

The format of the show often featured Perkins narrating off-camera, describing Fowler&#x27;s on-camera work with the wild animals. This was commonly parodied as Perkins saying &quot;I&#x27;ll wait here [someplace safe] while Jim does something or other with the dangerous animal.&quot;. However, according to a 1997 interview with Fowler, Perkins never said any such thing: according to Fowler, &quot;Johnny Carson started the jokes about me and Marlin in his monologues&quot;.

Perkins often featured pet chimpanzees in the studio: one named &quot;W. K.&quot; (Wild Kingdom); the other named &quot;Mr. Moke&quot;, after the Mini Moke vehicle.

&quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; increased ecological and environmental awareness in the United States. Its exciting footage brought the wilds of Africa, the Amazon River, and other exotic locales into the living rooms of millions of Americans. It created an interest in commercial nature programming that led to several other wildlife documentary programs going on the air, including &quot;Animal World&quot;, &quot;Wild, Wild World of Animals&quot; and &quot;Lorne Greene&#x27;s New Wilderness&quot;, and in subsequent decades, to entire cable television networks devoted to these topics, such as the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet.

Mutual of Omaha owns the rights to the program, but several episodes have been released on DVD from BCI Eclipse under license from Mutual of Omaha. Some episodes are also available on the Wild Kingdom official YouTube channel.

==Reruns==
As of April 4, 2021, Mutual of Omaha started syndicating the original series to RFD-TV, airing them in the original Sunday night timeslot through 2022. The classic episodes are introduced by Peter Gros, named host of the fourth revival in 2023. Today, viewers can watch these classic episodes on wildkingdom.com and the Wild Kingdom YouTube channel

==Revivals==

===Second incarnation: 2002 revival===
In 2002, a completely new &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot;, also sponsored by Mutual of Omaha, began airing new &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; specials on Animal Planet. The specials proved to be so popular that, in 2005, the network began airing new weekly episodes during the original Sunday night timeslot.

===Third incarnation: 2013 web series===
On November 3, 2013, &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom&quot; premiered as a series of webisodes that featured new host Stephanie Arne, a new format, and new stories.

# &quot;Reef Madness&quot;, featuring coral reefs of the Florida Keys.
# &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot;, featuring American bison across the South Dakota plains.
# &quot;Tegu Invasion&quot;, featuring tegu in the Florida Everglades.
# &quot;California Condor: Extreme Survival&quot;, featuring the California condor&#x27;s conservation success story.

A second season of new webisodes began in July 2014, and the third season began in March 2015. The fifth and last season was released in 2018.

===Fourth incarnation: 2023 revival===
On October 20, 2022, it was announced on the program&#x27;s website and YouTube channel that a fourth incarnation—the third regular series revival—went into production with the title &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom Protecting the Wild&quot;. This incarnation features new co-hosts: wildlife expert Peter Gros, who was part of the original &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; series, and Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant, wildlife ecologist and science communicator. The new series premiered in October 2023 on NBC and is produced by Hearst Media Production Group as part of the network&#x27;s Saturday morning &quot;The More You Know&quot; educational and informational programming block.

<text>The Sequatchie River is a waterway that drains the Sequatchie Valley, a large valley in the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. It empties into the Tennessee River downstream from Chattanooga near the Tennessee-Alabama state line.

==Hydrography==

The Sequatchie River originates from several springs at or near Devilstep Hollow Cave, including the spring, Head of the Sequatchie, which is protected as part of the Justin P. Wilson Cumberland Trail State Park. Dye traces establish the origin of their water as originating from Grassy Cove, the pastoral limestone sinkhole located to the north-east. The Sequatchie River follows the general trend of the Sequatchie Valley, flowing south-west for .

The stream crosses into Bledsoe County near the head of the Sequatchie Valley. The Sequatchie Valley is traversed throughout much its length by U.S. Route 127. The first sizeable town on the Sequatchie is Pikeville, the county seat of Bledsoe. State Route 30, which descends Walden&#x27;s Ridge into the Valley and then climbs the escarpment back onto the plateau, crosses here.

Crossing into Sequatchie County, the stream flows into Dunlap. Just north of Dunlap, US 127 turns southeastward, beginning the ascent onto Walden Ridge and eventually down into Chattanooga. A set of railroad tracks previously ran along the river from this point, testament to heavy underground coal extraction in years past. For almost the rest of its length the Sequatchie is paralleled by State Route 28. State Route 283 also runs along the base of the Walden&#x27;s Ridge escarpment for several miles. The river then enters Marion County. The town of Whitwell is just a few miles into Marion County. Below Whitwell at the small community of Sequatchie (also known as Sequachee), the river receives the flow of the Little Sequatchie River, which descends from atop the Cumberland Plateau to the west. At Jasper, which is slightly west of the river, is a railroad junction. East of town is the crossing of U.S. Highway 41 by SR 28, and the bridge over the river. Shortly south of the Interstate 24 bridge is the mouth of the Sequatchie into the Guntersville Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River.

<doc id="891009" wikidata="Q1204526" url="?curid=891009" title="Gashapon">
<text>, also called , is a kind of vending machine-dispensed capsule toy manufactured and sold by Bandai. It originated in the 1960s and is popular in Japan.

The word , a Bandai trademark, is onomatopoeic from two sounds, &quot;gasha&quot; (or &quot;gacha&quot;) for the hand-cranking action of a toy-vending machine, and &quot;pon&quot; for the toy capsule landing in the collection tray. is used for both the machines themselves and the toys obtained from them. 

Popular capsule toy manufacturers include Tomy, which uses the trademark for their capsule machines, and Kaiyodo. In many countries and territories including Japan, China, the United States, the European Union (European Union trade mark) and the United Kingdom, is a registered trademark of Bandai. The capsule toy model has been adapted digitally into numerous &quot;gacha&quot; video games, such as mobile phone games and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs).

== Description ==

 machines typically sell toys at prices ranging from 100 to 500 Japanese yen. The toys are often constructed from high-grade PVC plastic, and contain detailed molding and intricately painted features. They are engineered for high quality, small size, and minimal manufacturing cost; many do not turn a profit for their producers. Some are considered collector&#x27;s items.

 toys are often licensed from popular characters in Japanese manga, video games or anime, or from the American entertainment industry. These highly detailed toys have found a large following among all generations in Japan, and the trend is spreading elsewhere in the world, especially among adult collectors. It is not uncommon for sets marketed specifically for adults to feature risqué female figurines.

Virtually all are released in sets—each series will have a number of figures to collect. They are by nature a &quot;blind purchase&quot;; people insert coins and may hope to get a toy or figure they desire. Such an amusement element may become frustrating, as one risks obtaining the same item repeatedly.

Enthusiastic collectors will buy sets from stores in places such as Tokyo&#x27;s Akihabara or Osaka&#x27;s Nipponbashi (Den-Den Town). Depending on the store, the sets are usually cheaper than buying them randomly out of a machine.

Bandai has been selling toys since at least 1977. , Bandai Namco has sold toys for ¥100–500 each, generating approximately between in estimated sales revenue, since 1977.

Gashapon figures and items are available outside of Japan, including through officially licensed repackagings in the form of blind bags, sold in stores like the U.S. chains Five Below and Target. Dedicated gashapon stores also exist, including officially licensed Bandai Gashapon stores like the one in the American Dream mall in New Jersey, and individual gashapon machines in various stores and malls.

== Types ==

=== Blind-boxes ===
C&quot;apsule toys&quot; has also come to refer to blind-box trading figures, which are essentially the same product sold randomly out of sealed cardboard packages instead of a machine. One brand that does blind boxes is Chinese toy brand Pop Mart, which does designer toys, is very popular with teenagers and young adults. Kidrobot is another company famous for their blind boxes, in particular the Dunny series as well as collaborations with various popular franchises. Dreams Inc. uses blind boxes for its Sonny Angel and Smiski figurines.

There are also blind bags, which is a similar concept but in a disposable bag instead of a cardboard box. This is one way that &quot;Gashapon&quot; figures make it to the US, as companies like Bandai release their &quot;Gashapon&quot; figures as blind bags for American audiences. LEGO also used blind bags for their collectible Minifigure series, before switching to blind boxes due to environmental concerns. 

This is based on &quot;fukubukuro&quot;, a grab bag of randomized items for a set price that originated in Japan in the 1980s.

=== Bottle cap figures ===
Another variety of capsule toys is bottle cap figures. These small figures are mounted atop plastic bottle caps, as might be found on soda bottles. They are sold both in machine capsules and blind boxes. The caps are not functional as they lack screw threads to secure them to the mouth of the bottle.

== Video games ==
=== &quot;Gacha&quot; mechanism in &quot;gacha&quot; games ===

Games—often freemium—largely based on a mechanism of monetization are referred to as &quot;gacha games&quot;. &quot;Gacha&quot; mechanism, or &quot;gacha&quot;, is essentially a monetization model which the user pays with in-game currency to enter a draw in order to obtain the character or item they want. If a player does not obtain what they hoped for, there is the option of paying with their own money for more draws, and this is the main way to monetize the &quot;Gacha&quot; games. The game model arose in the early 2010s, faring particularly well in Japan. 

&quot;Gacha&quot; can be free to play. Rare or valuable gaming items often need to be obtained through special &quot;gacha&quot; purchased with real money. The games may feature different tiers of pulls, which give different sets of rewards. Examples of games include &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Collection&quot;. 

Many free-to-play massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) and mobile games also use &quot;gacha&quot; mechanics, with randomly generated items of varying market values being acquired via microtransactions. In addition, paid console games have included -style progression based on random items but with no in-app purchases, such as &quot;Work Time Fun&quot;.

The anime-oriented subculture surrounding the production of games has also given birth to the term &quot;gacha pop&quot;, referring to J-pop songs in diverse genres, from those of pop act Yoasobi to rock musician Kenshi Yonezu, associated with anime soundtracks or aesthetics sought by a global audience.

=== Impact of &quot;gacha&quot; mechanism on players ===

&quot;Gacha&quot; mechanism has come under scrutiny for its resemblance to gambling. Similar to gambling, &quot;gacha&quot; manipulates the emotional state of the player, specifically the player’s sense of luck, satisfaction and insecurity, as well as the player’s financial stability and dopamine release to ultimately cause a gaming addiction and encourage continued game play. Problematic use of &quot;gacha&quot; have also indicated to high levels of gambler’s fallacy. Gambler’s fallacy is a luck-related erroneous belief that a certain event is less or more likely to occur, based on a previous series of events. 

Winning high ranking virtual items in &quot;gacha&quot; is extremely rare and unpredictable. As a result, this can ultimately trigger the gambler’s fallacy in players. To minimize the relationship between gambling and the use of &quot;gacha&quot;, in 2016, the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) passed a law stating that companies must disclose the probability of drawing items in paid &quot;gachas&quot; so consumers can understand their chances of winning. This law is now respected and followed by every &quot;gacha&quot; game today.

Besides gambling, &quot;gacha&quot; games are also commonly associated with a social phenomenon called parasocial relationships. Parasocial relationships refer to a sense of attachment that develops between receivers and media characters. In terms of &quot;gacha&quot; games, &quot;Gacha&quot; players develop a parasocial relationship with in-game characters which players obtain through &quot;gacha&quot; mechanism. This parasocial relationship is primarily developed based on the character’s aesthetic and rich narrative element. Rentia and Karaseva’s study demonstrated how players are initially attracted to &quot;gacha&quot; games due to the games&#x27; aesthetic although moving forward, players grow to greatly value the narrative elements associated with the &quot;gacha&quot; characters. 

When a new character is introduced for the first time in a game, many &quot;gacha&quot; games will release a quest that follows the character’s life events, including the character’s life, intentions and aspirations, giving the opportunity for players to get acquainted with the characters. In &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; for example, when players pull a character, they receive more information and backstory about that specific character. Players can also read information on what characters think about other characters and their relationships. It is at this stage in which some players develop an intense emotional connection and as a result, engage in a parasocial relationship with an in-game character. For many players, the charming anime-style design of &quot;gacha&quot; characters create a strong attraction, which in time evolves into a strong emotional connection, then a parasocial relationship with the character. 

As a result of parasocial relationships with in-game characters, &quot;gacha&quot; players will personify the probability of drawing characters. Mackenzie and Lax’s study discovered how &quot;gacha&quot; communities traditionally referred to the successful acquisition of a desired character as the character ‘coming home.’ This reflects how, because of the strong emotional attachment they feel towards the character, &quot;gacha&quot; players will personify or give human life to character so much so the character develops a human capacity to acknowledge the player’s desire, and therefore returns home to where they belong.

<text>Dual Independent Map Encoding (DIME) is an encoding scheme developed by the US Bureau of the Census for efficiently storing geographical data. The committee behind the case study that eventually resulted in DIME was established in 1965, although the term &quot;DIME&quot; itself was first coined by George Farnsworth in August 1967. The file format developed for storing the DIME-encoded data was known as Geographic Base Files (GBF). The Census Bureau replaced the data format with Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) in 1990.

<text>James Patrick Archer (May 13, 1883 – March 29, 1958) was an Irish-born catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who spent nearly his entire career with four National League teams, primarily the Chicago Cubs, for whom he played from 1909 to 1917. Born in Dublin, he also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1904, the American League&#x27;s Detroit Tigers in 1907, and the Pirates, Brooklyn Robins and Cincinnati Reds in 1918. As a catcher, he could remain squatting and still throw out runners attempting to steal second base due to his unique arm strength, which became his trademark, acquired from the healing of burns that shortened his muscles after an industrial accident in which Archer fell into a vat of boiling sap at the age of 19.

His family immigrated to Montreal when he was an infant, later moving to Toronto when he was three; he attended Toronto&#x27;s De La Salle College and St. Michael&#x27;s College School. He was working at a barrelmaker in Toronto in 1902 when he suffered the burns which led to a three-month hospitalization. In 1903 he began playing baseball in Manitoba, and in 1904 he joined the Boone, Iowa based Boone Coal Miners team of the Iowa State League; he married Boone resident Lillian Stark in 1905. In August 1904 he was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates, and he went on to play seven games for the team that season.

He later played for Detroit for 18 games during the 1907 season, and started the fifth and final game of the 1907 World Series against the Cubs, but was hitless in three at bats as the Tigers lost 2–0; both Cub runs followed successful stolen bases against Archer and pitcher George Mullin. In 1909 he began playing for the Cubs, the team he remained with until 1917; he took over catching duties for Johnny Kling, one of the top players on the Cubs pennant winners of 1906 to 1908, who was taking a year off from baseball to pursue other interests. Archer split time with Pat Moran during the 1909 season, and with Kling upon his return for the 1910 season. He played three games en route to the Cubs&#x27; 1910 World Series loss to the Philadelphia Athletics, and after doubling with one out, scored the winning run on Jimmy Sheckard&#x27;s hit with two out in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 4 – the 4–3 victory giving the Cubs their only win in the Series. However, he had only one other hit in the Series, that coming with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 5 when the Cubs were trailing 7–2.

In 1911 Archer won the starting job, and Kling was later that season traded to the Boston Rustlers. Archer ended up finishing 16th in voting for the first Chalmers Award, the first formal Most Valuable Player Award presented in the major leagues. During the 1912 and 1913 seasons, Archer again earned some votes for the Chalmers Award, finishing 22nd in 1912 and 13th in 1913. He led the NL in assists in 1912 with 149, but also paced the league with 23 errors. However, he began to split time at catcher with Roger Bresnahan in 1914 and 1915. After playing 77 games in 1916 and only two in 1917, Archer was released by the Cubs. Over the course of the 1918 season, he played for three separate teams. He signed as a free agent with the Pirates on March 10, and played 24 games with them. However, he had a batting average of only .155 during that time and was released. He later played for the Brooklyn Robins and Cincinnati Reds for nine games each until his retirement at the end of the season.

In 847 games over 12 seasons, Archer posted a .249 batting average (660 hits in 2646 at bats) with 247 runs, 16 home runs, 299 runs batted in and 36 stolen bases. He recorded an overall .972 fielding percentage. In four World Series games, he hit .143 (2-for-14).

After his retirement from baseball, Archer worked as a hog purchaser for the Armour meat packing company in Chicago. He received a medal from the National Safety Council in 1931 after using prone pressure resuscitation to revive two truck drivers who had been overcome by carbon monoxide in the Union Stock Yards. Archer died at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the age of 74, due to a blocked coronary artery following treatment for spinal tuberculosis. He was interred at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Boone, Iowa, his wife&#x27;s hometown. He was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990.

<text>S-attributed grammars are a class of attribute grammars characterized by having no inherited attributes, but only synthesized attributes. Inherited attributes, which must be passed down from parent nodes to children nodes of the abstract syntax tree during the semantic analysis of the parsing process, are a problem for bottom-up parsing because in bottom-up parsing, the parent nodes of the abstract syntax tree are created &quot;after&quot; creation of all of their children. Attribute evaluation in S-attributed grammars can be incorporated conveniently in both top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing.

Specifications for parser generators in the Yacc family can be broadly considered S-attributed grammars. However, these parser generators usually include the capacity to reference global variables and/or fields from within any given grammar rule, meaning that this is not a &quot;pure&quot; S-attributed approach.

Any S-attributed grammar is also an L-attributed grammar.

<doc id="891034" wikidata="Q223230" url="?curid=891034" title="Leopold Staff">
<text>Leopold Henryk Staff (November 14, 1878 – May 31, 1957) was a Polish poet; an artist of European modernism twice granted the Degree of Doctor honoris causa by universities in Warsaw and in Kraków. He was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Polish PEN Club. Representative of classicism and symbolism in the poetry of Young Poland, he was an author of many philosophical poems influenced by the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche (from whom he translated several books into Polish), the ideas of Franciscan order as well as paradoxes of Christianity.

==Life==
Staff was born in Lwów (then in the Austrian partition; now Lviv, Ukraine) during the military partitions of Poland. He was one of three children of the local confectioner of Czech &amp; German origin. He studied law and philosophy at the Lwów University, and in 1918 settled in Warsaw at the cusp of Poland&#x27;s return to independence. He died at the age of 78 in Skarżysko-Kamienna soon after the end of Stalinism in postwar Poland, and was buried in Warsaw at the renowned Powązki Cemetery.

Staff was highly influential in the interwar period, including in the literary life of Julian Tuwim, one of Poland&#x27;s best-known poets. He served as vice-president of the Polish Academy of Literature since 1933, and since 1949 resided in Warsaw.

==Literary career==
Staff&#x27;s writing can be divided into three periods: Young Poland until 1918, Interwar period (1918–39), and postwar Poland (following the end of World War II).

In the early 20th century, Staff became probably the most famous and influential Polish poet. He called his popularity a &quot;retiring, soft glory&quot;. He was also the main role-model for Polish group of experimental poets named &quot;Skamander&quot; (founded in 1918). In the 1950s, he moved to blank verse in line with the ideals of Polish avant-garde.

Some of his best-known short poems include &quot;The Bridge&quot; (&quot;Most&quot;), &quot;Foundations&quot; (&quot;Podwaliny&quot;, transl. by Czesław Miłosz), and &quot;Three Towns&quot; (&quot;Trzy miasta&quot;, 1954).

<doc id="891046" wikidata="Q1095986" url="?curid=891046" title="Class-responsibility-collaboration card">
<text>Class-responsibility-collaboration (CRC) cards are a brainstorming tool used in the design of object-oriented software. They were originally proposed by Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck as a teaching tool but are also popular among expert designers and recommended by extreme programming practitioners. Author Martin Fowler has written that CRC cards may be a sensible means by which multiple alternative interactions may be quickly devised, as they avoid a great deal of drawing and erasing. CRC card sessions may be followed by the creation of sequence diagrams to capture interactions that are identified.

CRC cards are frequently employed during the design phase of system and software development to transition use-case descriptions into class diagrams, allowing a smoother transition with a greater overview and permitting developers to implement solutions with low binding and high cohesion.

CRC cards are usually created from index cards. Members of a brainstorming session will write one CRC card for each relevant class/object of their design. The card is partitioned into three areas:

# On top of the card, the class name
# On the left, the responsibilities of the class
# On the right, collaborators (other classes) with which the class interacts to fulfill its responsibilities

Using small cards minimizes the complexity of the design, reduces class responsibilities and keeps designers focused on the essentials of the classes without exploring implementation details. Because the cards are portable, they can easily be laid out on a table and rearranged while discussing a design.

== Creating CRC cards ==

Creation of CRC cards normally begins with writing a scenario that identifies the major actors and actions. From the scenario, nouns should become classes, verbs become responsibilities and collaborators are the other cards with which the card will interact.

<doc id="891050" wikidata="Q22070239" url="?curid=891050" title="Telephone numbers in China">
<text>Telephone numbers in the People&#x27;s Republic of China are administered according to the Telecommunications Network Numbering Plan of China. The structure of telephone numbers for landlines and mobile service is different. Landline telephone numbers have area codes, whereas mobile numbers do not. In major cities, landline numbers consist of a two-digit area code followed by an eight-digit local number. In other places, landline numbers consist of a three-digit area code followed by a seven- or eight-digit local number. Mobile phone numbers consist of eleven digits.

Landline calls within the same area do not require the area code. Calls to other areas require dialing the trunk prefix &quot;0&quot; and the area code.

The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are not part of this numbering plan, and use the calling codes 852 and 853 respectively.

== Mobile phones ==
In mainland China, mobile phone numbers have eleven digits in the format 1xx-XXXX-XXXX (except for 140–144, which are 13-digit IoT numbers), in which the first three digits (13x to 19x) designate the mobile phone service provider.

Before GSM, mobile phones had 6-digit (later upgraded to 7-digit) numbers starting with nine. They had the same numbering format as fixed-line telephones. Those numbers were eventually translated into 1390xx9xxx, where xx were local identifiers.

The oldest China Mobile GSM numbers were ten digits long and started with 139 in 1994, the second oldest 138 in 1997, and 137, 136, 135 in 1999. The oldest China Unicom numbers started with 130 in 1995, the second oldest at 131 in 1998. Keeping the same number over time is somewhat associated with the stability and reliability of the owner. The 5th to the seventh digit sometimes relates to age and location.

China&#x27;s mobile telephone numbers were changed from ten digits to eleven digits, with 0 added after 13x, and thus the HLR code became four-digit long to expand the capacity of the seriously fully crowded numbering plan.

In 2006, 15x numbers were introduced. In late 2008, 18x and 14x (for data plans or IoT) were introduced. In late 2013, 17x were introduced. In 2017, 16x and 19x were introduced.

In December 2016, each cell phone number was required to be consigned to a real name in mainland China. 

In November 2010, MIIT has started the trial mobile number portability service in Tianjin and Hainan, in 2012 the trial has extended to Jiangxi, Hubei and Yunan provinces. On 10 November 2019, all provinces started accepting MNP requests for all mobile carriers, except for technical difficulties, the MVNO phones, satellite phones and IoT phones.

Mobile service carriers can be identified by the first three or four digits as follows:

#China Unicom before 2009
#Operated by China Transport Telecommunication Information Group Co., Ltd.
#TD-SCDMA networks deprecated by China Mobile in 2020
#China Unicom finalize deprecated the GSM networks in 2021. A plan to deprecate GSM by China Mobile announced in 2023, scheduled to shut down in 2025
#CDMA2000 1x Ev-Do networks deprecated in 2022, and CDMA2000 1x RTT in 2024
#LTE compatibility of China Broadnet SIM cards only available on Apple iOS devices
#WCDMA networks are being deprecated by China Unicom since 2023

1G TACS networks were provided by China Telecom since 1987, operations transferred to China Mobile in 1999, the year China Mobile established, 1G shut down in 2001.

== Calling formats ==
To call phone numbers in China one of the following formats is used:

* For fixed phones:
xxx xxxx | xxxx xxxx Calls within the same area code

0yyy xxx xxxx | 0yyy xxxx xxxx Calls from other areas within China

+86 yyy xxx xxxx | +86 yyy xxxx xxxx Calls from outside China

* For mobile phones:
1nn xxxx xxxx Calls to mobile phones within China

+86 1nn xxxx xxxx Calls to mobiles from outside China

== Area 1 – Capital Operation Center ==
The prefix one is used exclusively by the national capital, Beijing Municipality.

== Area 2 – Country Communication System Operating Center ==

== Emergency numbers ==
From within Mainland China, the following emergency numbers are used:

*110 – Police (12110 for SMS to police, not for calling, 95110 for maritime policies, 96110 to report frauds)
*119 – Fire brigade (12119 for forest fire in some regions)
*120 – Ambulance
*122 – Traffic accident (incorporated into 110 in some cities) (12122 on expressways)
*999 – Privately operated ambulance (Beijing only, calls outside Beijing is 010-999)

In most cities, the emergency numbers assist in Mandarin Chinese and English.

Starting from 2012 in Shenzhen, an implemented system upgrade to unify three emergency reporting services into one number, 110. A similar approach is being installed in more cities in China to make them more convenient.

As 112, 911, and 999 (except Beijing) are not official emergency numbers in China, when dialing them, a recording message is played about correction in Chinese and English twice, but no services are automatically redirected:

* China Mobile &amp; China Broadcom (include contract phones without SIM cards inserted, even dialed 110/119/120/122): For police dial 110, to report the fire dial 119, for an ambulance dial 120, to report the traffic accident dial 122. But when dialing 999 outside Beijing, and without 010 prefix: The number is incorrect, please check and dial again.
* China Unicom (include contract phones without SIM cards inserted, even dialed 110/119/120/122): Hello, please dial 110 for police, 119 for fire, 120 for ambulance, 122 for traffic accident, and dial area code before 112 for fixed phone obstacle.
* China Telecom (include contract phones without SIM cards inserted, even dialed 110/119/120/122): Sorry, the number you&#x27;ve dialed is not correct, please check it and redial.
* Non-contract phones without SIM cards inserted: Sorry, you didn&#x27;t apply for this service.

However, some local report said that in sometimes, only within Beijing, China Unicom landlines and mobile phones call 010-112 may be successful as reporting service for call failures.

*124x – Carrier Identification Code (formerly 190/196/197, abolished in 2018, to create space for mobile phone numbers.)
*125xx – Premium service of China Mobile (e.g. 12580 for China Mobile&#x27;s Directory assistance)
*179xx + target number followed – VoIP (e.g. 17901-133-0000-0000, 1790 for China Telecom, 1791 for China Unicom, and 1795 for China Mobile)
*400 xxx xxxx, 800 xxx xxxx – business numbers
**Differences: bills for 400 numbers are paid by both originating and terminating callers, and support calling from both landlines and mobile phones (usually 400-1/7 operate by China Mobile, 400-0/6 operate by China Unicom, 400-8/9 operate by China Telecom); bills for 800 numbers are just paid by terminating callers, but for non-landline users, mostly only China Telecom mobile phones may call 800 phones, because nearly all 800 phones are operated by China Telecom
**400-881-0000 for auditing China Telecom&#x27;s services
*95xxx(xxx), 96xxx(xxx) – enterprise public institution&#x27;s consumer services, include but not only bank, insurance, public utility, etc. for example:
**95588 – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)
**95105105 or 96006 – railway ticket services

<doc id="891052" wikidata="Q852000" url="?curid=891052" title="ClamAV">
<text>ClamAV (antivirus) is a free software, cross-platform antimalware toolkit able to detect many types of malware, including viruses. It was developed for Unix and has third party versions available for AIX, BSD, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, OpenVMS, OSF (Tru64), Solaris and Haiku. As of version 0.97.5, ClamAV builds and runs on Microsoft Windows. Both ClamAV and its updates are made available free of charge. One of its main uses is on mail servers as a server-side email virus scanner. 

== History ==
ClamAV was initially released with version 0.10 on May 8, 2002, by Polish university student Tomasz Kojm. In 2007, it was acquired by Sourcefire, which in turn was acquired by Cisco in 2013 and now operates under its Talos cybersecurity division.

=== Patent lawsuit ===
In 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro for its distribution of ClamAV as part of a security package. Trend Micro claimed that Barracuda&#x27;s utilization of ClamAV infringes on a software patent for filtering viruses on an Internet gateway. The free software community responded in part by calling for a boycott against Trend Micro. The boycott was also endorsed by the Free Software Foundation. Barracuda Networks counter-sued with IBM-obtained patents in July 2008. On May 19, 2011, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Final Rejection in the reexamination of Trend Micro&#x27;s U.S. patent 5,623,600.

== Features ==
ClamAV includes a command-line scanner, automatic database updater, and a scalable multi-threaded daemon running on an anti-virus engine from a shared library. The application features a Milter interface for sent mail and on-demand scanning. It recognizes:

* ZIP, RAR, Tar, Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, and SIS formats
* Most mail file formats
* ELF and Portable Executable (PE) files compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, and Upack, or obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor.
* Office Open XML file formats, HTML, Rich Text Format (RTF) and Portable Document Format (PDF).

The ClamAV virus database is updated at least every four hours and as of 10 February 2017 contained over 5,760,000 virus signatures with the daily update Virus DB number at 23040.

=== Real-time file scanning ===

In older Linux application versions, ClamAV did support real-time protection via the Fanotify add-on for the Linux kernel (version 3.8 and later.) Alternatively, one could use ClamFS (for any Unix-like operating system supporting FUSE).

Nowadays, the Real-Time Protection in Linux Systems, is provided through ClamAV&#x27;s ClamOnAcc application (under the name of &quot;On-Access Scanning&quot;) – which uses &quot;Clamd&quot; to provide real-time protection by scanning files when they are accessed.

In other words, the &quot;On-Access Scanner&quot; can detect and prevent access to malicious files based on the verdict received from &quot;Clamd&quot;. By default, it operates in &quot;notify-only mode&quot;, alerting users of any threats detected without actively blocking file access.

Enabling &quot;prevention mode&quot; can considerably impact performance, especially in commonly accessed directories, so it is advised to use it judiciously.

In order to use ClamOnAcc, users need to first run clamd and then start the On-Access Scanner as root (to leverage its kernel event detection and intervention capabilities).

Configuration for On-Access Scanning is primarily done through &quot;clamd.conf,&quot; with additional options available in the On-Access Scanning User Guide.

Users can run multiple instances of ClamOnAcc simultaneously with different configurations, allowing for customized protection settings for various directories.

&quot;ClamOnAcc&quot; (v0.102+) is a client application that operates alongside clamd (the ClamAV daemon), to perform On-Access Scanning.

Regarding previous versions that were meant for Microsoft Windows, a free, open-source app called Clam Sentinel did use to detect file changes and scanned modified files using ClamWin. It did work with Windows 98 and later. In addition to on-access scanning, it used to feature optional system change messages and proactive heuristic protection.

== Effectiveness ==
In the 2008 AV-TEST comparison of antivirus tools, ClamAV scored poorly in on-demand detection, avoiding false positives, and rootkit detection.

In a Shadowserver six-month test between June and December 2011, ClamAV detected over 75.45% of all viruses tested, putting it in fifth place behind AhnLab, Avira, BitDefender and Avast. AhnLab, the top antivirus, detected 80.28%.

In 2022 Splunk conducted an efficacy study involving 416,561 malware samples sourced from MalwareBazaar, bucketed as follows: 106135 Banking Trojans (trojans targeted towards stealing financial information); 26875 Botnets (malware for making the victim a part of a botnet); 190371 Information Stealers (programs designed to steal client information. E.g. Keyloggers); 52422 Loaders (program that loads one or more other malicious programs – that is, a stager that fetches harmful things directly into memory); 1321 Miners (crypto currency miners); 30251 RATs (Remote access tools. E.g. Backdoors); and 8273 Trojans (a generic multipurpose malware that harms the user in different ways – generally disguises itself and delivered by tricking the user). Splunk&#x27;s study concluded ClamAV was 59.94% effective overall at detecting commodity malware – being able to detect 249,696/416,561 samples. 

In that same study, ClamAV performed relatively well at detecting certain types of malware in certain types of files (E.g. DOCX files, DIL files, ELF files, DOC files and EXE files), but was less effective in detecting malware in JAR files, JS files, VBS files, Z files, RAR files, and XLSB files. In addition, ClamAV performed well to detect a few top level categories of malware like Trojans &amp; Botnets but performed poorly on other malware types like Crypto Miners, RATs and Info Stealers.

== Unofficial databases ==
The ClamAV engine can be reliably used to detect several kinds of files. In particular, some phishing emails can be detected using antivirus techniques. However, false positive rates are inherently higher than those of traditional malware detection.

There are several unofficial databases for ClamAV:

* Sanesecurity is an organization that maintains a number of such databases; in addition they distribute and classify a number of similar databases from other parties, such as Porcupine, Julian Field, MalwarePatrol. 
* SecuriteInfo.com also provides additional signatures for ClamAV.

ClamAV Unofficial Signatures are mainly used by system administrators to filter email messages. Detections of these groups should be scored, rather than causing an outright block of the &quot;infected&quot; message.

== Platforms ==

=== Linux, BSD ===
ClamAV is available for Linux and BSD-based operating systems. In most cases it is available through the distribution&#x27;s repositories for installation.

On Linux servers ClamAV can be run in daemon mode, servicing requests to scan files sent from other processes. These can include mail exchange programs, files on Samba shares, or packets of data passing through a proxy server.

On Linux and BSD desktops ClamAV provides on-demand scanning of individual files, directories or the whole PC.

=== macOS ===
macOS Server has included ClamAV since version 10.4. It is used within the operating system&#x27;s email service. A paid-for graphical user interface is available from Canimaan Software Ltd in the form of &quot;ClamXav&quot;. Additionally, Fink, Homebrew and MacPorts have ported ClamAV.

Another program which uses the ClamAV engine on macOS, is Counteragent. Working alongside the Eudora Internet Mail Server program, Counteragent scans emails for viruses using ClamAV and also optionally provides spam filtering through SpamAssassin.

=== OpenVMS ===
ClamAV for OpenVMS is available for DEC Alpha and Itanium platforms. The build process is simple and provides basic functionality, including library, the codice_1 utility, the codice_2 daemon, and codice_3 for update.

=== Windows ===
There are IA-32 and x64 variants of ClamAV available for Windows; additionally, Cisco&#x27;s Immunet uses ClamAV as its engine.

=== OS/2 ===
A port of ClamAV is available for OS/2 (including eComStation and ArcaOS) with a native UI written in REXX.

== Graphical interfaces ==
Since ClamAV does not include a graphical user interface (GUI) but instead is run from the command line, a number of third-party developers have written GUIs for the application for various platforms and uses.

These include:

* Linux
** ClamTk using gtk2-perl; project is named for the Tk libraries that were used when it began
** KlamAV for TDE (development of the original KDE version was discontinued in 2009)
** wbmclamav is a webmin module to manage Clam AntiVirus
* macOS
** ClamXav is a port which includes a graphical user interfaces and has a &quot;sentry&quot; service which can watch for changes or new files in many cases. There is also an update and scanning scheduler through a cron job facilitated by the graphical interface. ClamXav can detect malware specific to macOS, Unix, or Windows. The ClamXav application and the ClamAV engine are updated regularly. ClamXav is written and sold by Canimaan Software Ltd.
** Tiger Cache Cleaner is shareware software which installs and presents a graphic interface for using ClamAV to scan for viruses, and provides other unrelated functions.
* Microsoft Windows
** Immunet
** ClamWin
** CS Antivirus
** Graugon AntiVirus
** Clam Sentinel
* OS/2
** ClamAV-GUI

=== ClamWin ===

ClamWin is a graphical user interface front-end ClamWin Pty Ltd. developed for ClamAV on Microsoft Windows. Features include on-demand (user-started) scanning, automatic updates, scheduled scanning, and integration with File Explorer and Microsoft Outlook. ClamWin does not provide on-access scanning. A Firefox add-on enables ClamWin to scan downloaded files. Several other extensions allow users to process downloaded files with any software and scan the files with ClamWin.

<text>The Air and Space Recognition Ribbon (ASRR) is a military award of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force which was first created in October 1980 as the Air Force Recognition Ribbon. The ribbon is intended to recognize those who have received &quot;non-portable&quot; awards for accomplishment and excellence while serving on active duty in the United States Air Force or United States Space Force. On 16 November 2020, the Air Force Recognition Ribbon was renamed to the Air and Space Recognition Ribbon by the Secretary of the Air Force.
To receive the Air and Space Recognition Ribbon, a service member must receive a designated trophy, plaque, or other award (such as the Sijan Leadership Award) through an achievement as specified by Air Force regulations. The ribbon is thus intended to recognize awards which cannot otherwise be displayed on a military uniform; as such, this award is typically presented in combination with an Air Force or Space Force level annual award.

Additional awards of the Air and Space Recognition Ribbon are denoted by oak leaf clusters.

<text>The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) is a development bank that helps Caribbean countries finance social and economic programs in its member countries through loans, grants, and technical assistance. The CDB was established by an Agreement signed on October 18, 1969, in Kingston, Jamaica, which entered into force on January 26, 1970. The idea for the bank originated from the 1966 Canada/Commonwealth Caribbean Conference.

The permanent headquarters of the CDB is located in Wildey, St. Michael, Barbados, adjacent to the campus of the Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic. On September 21, 2018, the Bank officially opened its Country Office in Haiti, the first outside its Headquarters in Barbados. The headquarters in Barbados serves all of the regional borrowing member countries, with staff recruited from its member states.

== History ==
The Caribbean Development Bank was established by an agreement between sixteen members of the Commonwealth of Nations in the Caribbean region, along with Canada and the United Kingdom. Signed on October 18, 1969, in Kingston, Jamaica, the Agreement entered into force on January 26, 1970 when 15 of the 18 signing states ratified it. The bank&#x27;s initial capital was 50 million USD, equivalent to 100 million Eastern Caribbean dollar, with main contributions from Jamaica (11,200,000 USD and 19.52% of votes), and the United Kingdom and Canada contributing 10,000,000 USD each with 17.55% of votes in bank.

The bank was created with the purpose of promoting sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty in the region, aligning with Arthur Lewis&#x27;s vision of economic development. During the first meeting of governors in Nassau, Lewis, who was an economist, was appointed the first president of the Caribbean Development Bank. His leadership was essential to establishing the bank&#x27;s operations, emphasizing the importance of financial discipline and efficiency in development through agriculture and infrastructure projects. At this time, the bank aimed to reduce economic disparities among its member states by using soft loans to finance public works and agricultural development in the less developed states. 

Lewis set the CDB&#x27;s independence up by retaliating against political interference in the financial decisions of the bank. He also ensured there would be efficient administration and a focus on the Caribbean states to become a key financial instrument for the countries that lacked access to international financial institutions. Lewis also played a key role in building strong relationships with other international organizations like the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and USAID that helped the bank gain legitimacy and credibility.

== Organization ==
=== Board of Governors ===
The Board of Governors is the apex governing body of the CDB. It meets annually and has the authority to:

* Admit new members
* Amend the charter
* Elect the Board of Directors and President
* Change the bank&#x27;s outstanding capital
* Dissolve the bank.

Each country is represented by one governor and one alternate, with the British Overseas Territory members counted as one country. 

=== Board of directors ===
The Board of Directors is responsible for:

* Determining the bank&#x27;s programs and annual budget
* Overseeing its operations
* Appointing the Oversight and Assurance Committee

As with the Board of Governors, each country is represented by one director and one alternate. Directors serve renewable two-year terms. 

=== President ===
The President is the chief executive officer of the CDB, and also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Different offices for communication, risk management, and compliance are part of the Office of the President. 

Presidential candidates are nominated by individual country members. A candidate must receive votes from two-thirds of the Board of Governors (representing 75% of the member countries) in order to be selected. The President serves for a five-year term, with the possibility of re-election.

=== List of presidents ===
The Bank has had seven presidents since its inception.
=== Corporate leadership ===
The two corporate leaders that report to the boards are the Vice-President Finance and Corporate Services and the Vice-President (Operations). 

== Financial Overview ==
As of December 31, 2021, the CDB&#x27;s total assets stood at US$3.71 billion, which included US$2.21 billion of Ordinary Capital Resources and US$1.50 billion of Special Funds Resources.

The Bank holds a high credit rating from international agencies:

* Aa1 (Stable) by Moody&#x27;s
* AA+ (Stable) by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s
* AA+ (Stable) by Fitch Ratings.

In 2021, the Bank approved US$269.5 million in loans and grants. At the end of 2020, the total value approved projects by the bank was US$122.6 million, including US$71.2 million in loans and US$51.4 million in grants.

==== Regional ====
===Other regional===
===Non-regional===
== United Nations Development Business ==
The United Nations launched &quot;Development Business&quot; in 1978 with the support of the Caribbean Development Bank, the World Bank, and many other major development banks from around the world. Today, Development Business is the primary publication for all major multilateral development banks, United Nations agencies, and several national governments, many of whom have made the publication of their tenders and contracts in Development Business a mandatory requirement.

== Recent Developments and Risk Management ==
In 2012, the CDB experienced a credit downgrade due to weaknesses in the banks credit profile. The downgrade reflected concerns about the deteriorating financial conditions of its borrowing member countries, this posed risks the banks ability to finance loans effectively. There were also inefficiencies in CDB&#x27;s risk management practices which prompted the bank to adopt a Enterprise Risk Management framework to address these issues. This design was meant strengthen the bank&#x27;s governance, risk management, and operational processes, ensuring better oversight, accountability, and financial stability. 

== Partnerships ==
The CDB collaborates with distinct institutions like the Green Climate Fund to promote sustainable development and climate resilience across the region. The bank also facilitates soft loans and technical assistance for its smaller member states by working closely with partners like the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank.

<doc id="891070" wikidata="Q6248395" url="?curid=891070" title="John Meikle">
<text>John Meikle (11 September 1898 – 20 July 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Born in Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire, Meikle&#x27;s family later moved to Nitshill, on the south side of Glasgow. Here, after leaving school, he worked as a clerk at the ticket office of Nitshill railway station.

In February 1915 he enlisted in the Seaforth Highlanders, joining the regiment&#x27;s 4th Battalion in France in July 1916. He was serving as a lance-corporal at the Third Battle of Ypres when he won the Military Medal for bravery on 20 September 1917 at the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge.

===VC action===
Meikle was a 19 years old sergeant in the 4th Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place on 20 July 1918 near Marfaux, France, during the Second Battle of the Marne for which he was awarded the VC.

Meikle is buried at Marfaux British Cemetery, maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, in the Marne department of France.

==Memorial==
A memorial to John Meikle stands outside Dingwall railway station. The inscription reads: &quot;In memory of Sergt John Meikle V.C M.M late clerk at Nitshill Station who enlisted in H.M. Forces (Seaforth Highlanders) 8th February 1915 during the Great War and was killed in action on 20th July 1918. Erected by his railway comrades&quot;.

The memorial was originally erected at Nitshill railway station in 1920, where, over the decades, it suffered vandalism. It was then moved to Levern Primary School in Nitshill, the local school Meikle had attended, and was on display in the school entrance for many years. When the school was to be demolished in 1997 the Head Teacher, Margaret Gallagher, contacted the Railway Authorities to enable the memorial to be saved for posterity. It now stands outside Dingwall station, while a new memorial, funded by the Railway Heritage Trust, was unveiled at Nitshill Station on 18 October 2016.

Meikle&#x27;s medals, including the Victoria Cross, are displayed at Dingwall Museum in Ross-Shire.

<text>The president of the Ohio State Senate is the leader of the Ohio State Senate. Under Ohio&#x27;s first constitution, in effect from 1803 to 1851, the presiding officer of the senate was called the speaker. Starting in 1851, when the second constitution took effect, a new office of lieutenant governor was created. The new position of lieutenant governor carried with it the office of president of the senate, and was nominally the presiding officer of the senate. During this time, the actual legislative leader of the senate majority was the president pro tempore of the Ohio Senate. In the 1970s, another change was made, which made the office of lieutenant governor elected jointly with the governor. At this time, the duty of presiding over the senate was removed from the lieutenant governor&#x27;s portfolio and the majority party of the senate began electing its own president starting in 1979. The president is second in line to the office of the governor.

<text>Michael Joseph Donlin (May 30, 1878 – September 24, 1933) was an American professional baseball outfielder and actor. His Major League Baseball (MLB) career spanned from 1899 to 1914 in which he played mainly in the National League for seven teams over 12 seasons. His most notable time was with the New York Giants, where he starred in the outfield for John McGraw&#x27;s 1904 pennant winners and 1905 World Series champions. One of the finest hitters of the dead-ball era, his .333 career batting average ranks 28th all time and he finished in the top three in batting five times. In each of those same seasons, he also finished in the top ten in the league in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and home runs.

Donlin, who was given the nickname &quot;Turkey Mike&quot; for his unique strut, was a controversial character— his entertaining personality, flamboyant style of dress, and prodigious talent as a hitter caused him to be lionized as &quot;the baseball idol of Manhattan.&quot; However, alcoholism led to friction with club officials and incarceration. Donlin attempted to leverage his popularity as an athlete to launch a career in Broadway theatre where he met and married vaudeville comedian Mabel Hite in 1906. Together, they performed in the baseball-themed play &quot;Stealing Home&quot; for about three years.

Between the waning popularity of the play in 1911 and Hite&#x27;s death the following year, Donlin attempted short-lived comebacks with the Giants, Boston Rustlers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. His forays into acting cut short an undeniable talent that could have been a much more successful major league career; he reached 100 games in just five of his major league seasons. After convincing McGraw to sign him for the last time in 1914, Donlin endured a disappointing 35-game cameo with the Giants, leading him to devote his efforts to launch his acting career. He migrated to Hollywood, where close friend John Barrymore helped him attain work. Although he made at least 53 appearances on film, the prospects of stardom never materialized. Donlin remained in Hollywood continuing in his acting career until his death in 1933.

Donlin made his way to California and was playing for the Santa Cruz Sandcrabs in 1899 when he was purchased by the St. Louis Perfectos for &quot;little more than train fare.&quot; Donlin learned of the transaction while he was locked up in a Santa Cruz jail for drunkenness. He gained admittance when he first arrived at St. Louis&#x27; League Park by pointing the gatekeeper to a newspaper photograph of himself which he had pinned to his lapel.

Despite not joining the team until mid-July, he finished 10th in the National League in home runs and batted .323. The following season he hit .326 and finished third in home runs with 10 while only playing in about half of St. Louis&#x27; games. On a team full of good hitters, Donlin found it difficult to get regular playing time because of his poor defense and decided to jump to the Baltimore Orioles of the new American League in to play for his former teammate in St. Louis, John McGraw.

&quot;Turkey Mike&quot;, nicknamed because of his gait while walking, hit .340 with Baltimore, which was good for second in the league. But in March of , he was sentenced to six months in prison for assaulting two people in Baltimore while drunk and was promptly released by the Orioles. After serving his time, Donlin was picked up by the Cincinnati Reds and hit .287 for them in the last month of the season. In , he finished third in the league in hitting at .351 and placed in the top five in the National League in virtually every offensive category.

Donlin hit .356 in 1904, when he had another drunken episode in St. Louis. The Reds first suspended him for 30 days and then traded him to the New York Giants, where he was once again reunited with John McGraw who was now managing the team. Donlin finished out the 1904 season hitting a respectable .280 after the trade and helped the Giants win the National League pennant. His combined batting average for 1904 ended up at .329, good enough for second in the league for the second time in the career of the 26-year-old.

Donlin followed up with the best season of his career in . Playing a full season for the first time, Donlin hit .356, good for third in the National League, and led the league in runs scored as well as finishing in the top five in several other batting categories. He led the Giants to the World Series where he hit .263 and scored 4 runs in 5 games as the Giants defeated the Philadelphia Athletics for their first World Series Championship.

On April 11, 1906, Donlin was married to Mabel Hite, a vaudeville and Broadway actress. Tragedy struck early in the season, however, as he broke his ankle sliding into second base and was lost for the remainder of the season. Cocky and brash as ever, Donlin demanded his same salary for the 1907 season as well as a $600 bonus incentive for staying sober throughout the year. When Giants owner John T. Brush refused, Donlin retired and sat out the entire season. Donlin spent the time traveling with his wife and became interested in the theater and the high-society lifestyle that came with it.

Donlin returned to the Giants for the season without showing any effects from a year-long layoff as he hit .334 and finished second in the league in hitting for the third time in his career. In his first home game back, he hit a game-winning two-run home run in the bottom of the 9th inning. He was also among the league leaders in virtually every other offensive category and turned in an adequate job defensively for the first time.

=== Comeback ===
In , Donlin returned to his old team and manager, John McGraw, after a two-year break for acting.

Donlin&#x27;s talents had declined and was no longer worth the problems he created and was sold to the Boston Rustlers, having only played 12 games for his former New York team. Boston immediately inserted him into their starting lineup and Donlin responded by hitting .315 for them.

Unwilling to negotiate with a hard-bargaining, poor defensive outfielder on a poor team, Boston traded him to Pittsburgh, where he played the season as a reserve for the Pirates, batting .316. In the fall of 1912, Hite was diagnosed with cancer and died in October. In December Pittsburgh placed Donlin on waivers and he was claimed by the Philadelphia Phillies. Donlin refused to go to the Phillies and instead retired, once again, from baseball.

He had a change of heart and attempted a comeback late in 1913 with the minor league Jersey City Skeeters and convinced his old friend, John McGraw, to select him to a traveling team that barnstormed in Europe, Asia and Africa in the winter of 1913. Encouraged by his hitting, McGraw gave Donlin a roster spot on the Giants but the magic in his bat was gone. Hitting only .161 in 35 games, Donlin called it quits, this time for good.

==Career statistics==
== Acting career ==
On October 26, 1908, Donlin made his stage debut in &quot;Stealing Home&quot;, a one-act play written by Donlin and Hite. Although the reviews for Donlin were mixed, critics raved over his wife&#x27;s performance and the show became a smash hit. Claiming he made more money from his play, Donlin left baseball and vowed never to return to baseball but after three successful years, the play&#x27;s popularity diminished and with Hite not able to land any successful roles, Donlin returned to baseball.

Starting in 1914, Donlin teamed up with Marty McHale, for an act they titled, &quot;Right Off the Bat&quot;.

Donlin later made the career change once again from baseball to acting, gradually switching from stage to screen. He had more success on the baseball field than in the entertainment industry, although he appeared in a number of movies in small roles, including the silent classic &quot;The General&quot; (1926), and in Paramount&#x27;s first sound feature &quot;Warming Up&quot; (1928). He was also retained as an advisor on a number of baseball movies. One of Donlin&#x27;s great friends and drinking buddies was renowned actor John Barrymore. Donlin appeared in at least two of the actor&#x27;s silent pictures, &quot;Raffles the Amateur Cracksman&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Sea Beast&quot; (1926). One of his many cinematic appearances was in an uncredited role as a Hong Kong bartender in &quot;One Way Passage&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Born in Peoria, Illinois, Donlin&#x27;s family soon moved to Erie, Pennsylvania, where he lost both his father, railroad conductor John Donlin, and mother, Maggie, in a train accident when he was a young boy. He was forced to hustle to survive from a young age, worked as a machinist in his youth and was resultantly a sickly child. At 15 years old he found work selling candy on a California-bound train. Once in California, he put down roots.

Donlin was a flamboyant playboy, a sharp dresser and a notorious drinker. With his dashing looks and penchant for finding trouble, he was equally popular with women and men and was one of the most popular players in baseball for a short time at the peak of his career. As a young minor leaguer in California, Donlin asked a &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; employee to run a photograph of him in the paper, saying, &quot;I know I&#x27;ll get a break. I know I&#x27;m going to be great.&quot; A month after Admiral George Dewey&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Manila Bay, University of Oregon baseball coach Tom Kelly recalled Donlin using a bat that he had painted red, white and blue and named &quot;Dewey.&quot;

In October 1914 Donlin married actress Rita Ross, known for her part in the musical comedy team Ross and Fenton.

=== Death ===
Donlin died in his sleep of a heart attack on September 24, 1933, at age 55 in Hollywood, California.

=== Popular culture ===
The 1949 musical film &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; may have been influenced by Donlin&#x27;s life story.
The story involves a reigning World Series championship Major League Baseball team (the fictitious &quot;Chicago Wolves&quot;) whose two star players moonlight in the off-season as vaudeville performers, the commitment to which causes them to arrive late to spring training, thus angering their team manager and owner.

The script was written by Gene Kelly, who portrays Wolves&#x27; star shortstop/Vaudevillian &quot;Eddie O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Frank Sinatra co-stars as second baseman/vaudevillian &quot;Dennis Ryan&quot;.

The San Jose Giants, the Single-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants baseball club, have a BBQ and picnic area, &quot;Turkey Mike&#x27;s BBQ&quot;, named after Donlin.

<doc id="891085" wikidata="Q7439719" url="?curid=891085" title="Scènes à faire">
<text>A scène à faire (French for &quot;scene to be made&quot; or &quot;scene that must be done&quot;; plural: &quot;scènes à faire&quot;; both pronounced ) is a scene in a book or film which is almost obligatory for a book or film in that genre. In the U.S. it also refers to a principle in copyright law in which certain elements of a creative work are held to be not protected when they are mandated by or customary to the genre.

==Examples in different genres==

For example, a spy novel is expected to contain elements such as numbered Swiss bank accounts, a deadly woman, and various spy gadgets hidden in wristwatches, belts, shoes, and other personal effects. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit interpreted the &quot;scènes à faire&quot; doctrine expansively to hold that a motion picture about police work in the South Bronx would need to feature drunks, prostitutes, vermin, and derelict cars to be perceived as realistic, and therefore a later film that duplicated these features of an earlier film did not infringe. These elements are not protected by copyright, though specific sequences and compositions of them can be.

==Policy==

The policy rationale of the doctrine of &quot;scènes à faire&quot; is that granting a first comer exclusivity over &quot;scènes à faire&quot; would greatly hinder others in the subsequent creation of other expressive works. That would be against the constitutionally mandated policy of the copyright law to promote progress in the creation of works, and it would be an impediment to the public&#x27;s enjoyment of such further creative expressions. By the same token, little benefit to society would flow from grants of copyright exclusivity over &quot;scènes à faire&quot;.

In a business and computer program context, the doctrine of &quot;scènes à faire&quot; is interpreted to apply to the practices and demands of the businesses and industries that the given computer program serves. Hence, the concepts of idea vs. expression (merger doctrine) and &quot;scènes à faire&quot; relate directly to promoting availability of business functionality.

In &quot;CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Properties, Inc.&quot;, 97 F.3d 1504 (1st Cir. 1996), the court compared the merger and &quot;scènes à faire&quot; doctrines. The court said that the two doctrines were similar in policy, in that they both sought to prevent monopolization of ideas. However, merger applied when idea and expression were inseparable, but &quot;scènes à faire&quot; applied despite separability where an external common setting caused use of common elements and thus similarity of expression.

==Limits of doctrine==

The doctrine must be a matter of degree—that is, operate on a continuum. Consider the Second Circuit&#x27;s ruling that the &quot;scène à faire&quot; for a movie about the South Bronx would need to feature drunks, prostitutes, vermin (rats, in the accused and copyrighted works), and derelict cars. The principle must have a limit, however, so that something is outside the &quot;scènes à faire&quot; doctrine for South Bronx movies. Perhaps, cockroaches, gangs, and muggings are also part of the South Bronx &quot;scène à faire&quot;, but further similarity such as the film having as characters &quot;a slumlord with a heart of gold and a policeman who is a Zen Buddhist and lives in a garage&quot; surely goes beyond the South Bronx &quot;scène à faire&quot;. There must be some expression possible even in a cliche-ridden genre.&quot;

==Cases==
*&quot;Cain v. Universal Pictures&quot;, 47 F.Supp. 1013 (United States District Court for the Southern District of California 1942)
::This was the case where the term was introduced, when the writer James M. Cain sued Universal Pictures, the scriptwriter and the director for copyright infringement in connection with the film &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot;. Cain claimed a scene in his book where two protagonists take refuge from a storm in a church had been copied in a scene depicting the same situation in the movie. Judge Leon Rene Yankwich ruled that there was no resemblance between the scenes in the book and the film other than incidental &quot;scènes à faire&quot;, or natural similarities due to the situation.

*&quot;Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc.&quot;, 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1986)
::After the release of the film &quot;Fort Apache, The Bronx&quot;, author Thomas Walker filed a lawsuit against one of the production companies, Time-Life Television Films (legal owner of the script), claiming that the producers infringed on his book &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (New York: Crowell, 1976. ). Among other things, Walker, the plaintiff, argued that: &quot;both the book and the film begin with the murder of a black and a white policeman with a handgun at close range; both depict cockfights, drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes and rats; both feature as central characters third- or fourth-generation Irish policemen who live in Queens and frequently drink; both show disgruntled, demoralized police officers and unsuccessful foot chases of fleeing criminals.&quot; But the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that these are stereotypical ideas, and that the United States copyright law does not protect concepts or ideas. The court ruling stated: &quot;the book &quot;Fort Apache&quot; and the film &quot;Fort Apache: The Bronx&quot; were not substantially similar beyond [the] level of generalized or otherwise nonprotectible ideas, and thus [the] latter did not infringe copyright of [the] former.&quot;

*&quot;Joshua Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc.&quot;, 225 F.3d 1068 (9th Cir. 2000) 

::Another significant case in United States law was &quot;Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits&quot; (2003), in which &quot;scenes à faire&quot; was upheld as an affirmative defense by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The case involved a commercial photographer, Joshua Ets-Hokin, who sued SKYY vodka when another photographer created advertisements with a substantially similar appearance to work he had done for them in the past. It was established that the similarity between his work and the later works of the photographer was largely mandated by the limited range of expression possible; within the constraints of a photo shoot for a commercial product there are only so many ways one may photograph a vodka bottle. In light of this, to establish copyright infringement, the two photos would have been required to be virtually identical. The originality of the later work was established by such minor differences as different shadows and angles.

* &quot;Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.&quot;, 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993)

::A significant &quot;scènes à faire&quot; case in the computer program context is &quot;Gates v. Bando&quot;. The court explained the policy and application of the doctrine to computer program copyright infringement cases in these terms:

::Under the &quot;scènes à faire&quot; doctrine, we deny protection to those expressions that are standard, stock, or common to a particular topic or that necessarily follow from a common theme or setting. Granting copyright protection to the necessary incidents of an idea would effectively afford a monopoly to the first programmer to express those ideas. Furthermore, where a particular expression is common to the treatment of a particular idea, process, or discovery, it is lacking in the originality that is the &quot;sine qua non&quot; for copyright protection.

::The &quot;scènes à faire&quot; doctrine also excludes from protection those elements of a program that have been dictated by external factors. In the area of computer programs these external factors may include: hardware standards and mechanical specifications, software standards and compatibility requirements, computer manufacturer design standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry programming practices. 

* &quot;RG Anand v. M/s Deluxe Films&quot;&quot;, AIR 1978 SC 1613&quot;
::The plaintiff was the writer and producer of a play called &quot;&quot;Hum Hindustani&quot; that was produced in the period of 1953-1955. The play was based on the evils of provincialism. The defendant in 1956 produced a film called &quot;New Delhi&quot;&quot;. One of the themes of the film was provincialism, too. While evaluating whether or not the defendant had infringed the plaintiff&#x27;s copyright, the Supreme Court of India held:There can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter, &quot;themes&quot;, plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the copyright work. (emphasis supplied)Therefore, the court held that there is a standard way of dealing with the theme of provincialism, and there can be no copyright over that theme. Consequently, a question of infringement does not even arise.

<text>Else Freiin von Richthofen (October 8, 1874 – December 22, 1973) was among the early female social scientists in Germany.

==Life and career==
Elisabeth Helene Amalie Sophie Freiin (Baroness) von Richthofen (also known as Else Jaffé) was born into the Heinersdorf line of
the at Château-Salins (France). Her parents were Friedrich Ernst Emil Ludwig Freiherr von Richthofen (1844–1915), an engineer in the Imperial German Army, and Anna Elise Lydia Marquier (1852–1930). Her younger sister was the author and translator Frieda Lawrence.

While Else von Richthofen started her professional career as a teacher, she enrolled at Heidelberg University at a time when this was still very unusual for women; she was one of just four female students at the time. She earned a doctorate in economics in 1901 and started to work as a labour inspector in Karlsruhe. 

She married Edgar Jaffé (1865–1921), another former student of Max Weber, in 1902, and he was a well-known economist and entrepreneur. It was Jaffé who bought the journal &quot;Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik&quot; of which Max Weber became one of the editors. With Jaffé, she had three children, Friedel (born 1903), Marianne (born 1905) and Hans (born 1909). 

Else became acquainted to intellectuals and authors, including the sociologists and economists Max Weber and Alfred Weber, the psychoanalyst Otto Gross, the writer Fanny zu Reventlow and others. She started an affair with Otto Gross with whom she had a fourth child, Peter (1907–ca. 1915). She also had affairs with her former professor Max Weber and his brother Alfred Weber, with whom she lived together in the same house for several years after her husband died.

<doc id="891095" wikidata="Q1185363" url="?curid=891095" title="Awa Dance Festival">
<text>The is held from 12 to 15 August as part of the Obon festival in Tokushima Prefecture on Shikoku in Japan. Awa Odori is the largest dance festival in Japan, attracting over 1.3 million tourists every year.

Groups of choreographed dancers and musicians known as &quot;ren&quot; (連) dance through the streets, typically accompanied by the shamisen lute, taiko drums, shinobue flute and the kane bell. Performers wear traditional obon dance costumes, and chant and sing as they parade through the streets.

&quot;Awa&quot; is the old feudal administration name for Tokushima Prefecture, and &quot;odori&quot; means &quot;dance&quot;.

==History==
The earliest origins of the dance style are found in the Japanese Buddhist priestly dances of Nembutsu-odori and &quot;hiji-odori&quot; of the Kamakura period (1185–1333), and also in &quot;kumi-odori&quot;, a lively harvest dance that was known to last for several days.

The Awa Odori festival grew out of the tradition of the Bon Odori which is danced as part of the Bon &quot;Festival of the Dead&quot;, a Japanese Buddhist celebration where the spirits of deceased ancestors are said to visit their living relatives for a few days of the year. The term &quot;Awa Odori&quot; was not used until the 20th century, but Bon festivities in Tokushima have been famous for their size, exuberance and anarchy since the 16th century.
Awa Odori&#x27;s independent existence as a huge, citywide dance party is popularly believed to have begun in 1586 when Lord Hachisuka Iemasa, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Awa Province hosted a drunken celebration of the opening of Tokushima Castle. The locals, having consumed a great amount of sake, began to drunkenly weave and stumble back and forth. Others picked up commonly available musical instruments and began to play a simple, rhythmic song, to which the revelers invented lyrics. The lyrics are given in the &#x27;Song&#x27; section of this article.

This version of events is supported by the lyrics of the first verse of &quot;Awa Yoshikono Bushi&quot;, a local version of a popular folk song which praises Hachisuka Iemasa for giving the people Awa Odori and is quoted in the majority of tourist brochures and websites. However, according to local historian Miyoshi Shoichiro, this story first appeared in a &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper article in 1908 and is unsupported by any concrete evidence. It is unclear whether the song lyrics were written before or after this article appeared.
Some evidence of the festival&#x27;s history comes from edicts issued by the Tokushima-han feudal administration, such as this one dating from 1671:
1. The bon-odori may be danced for only three days.2. Samurai are forbidden to attend the public celebration. They may dance on their own premises but must keep the gates shut. No quarrels, arguments or other misbehaviour are allowed.3. The dancing of bon-odori is prohibited in all temple grounds.
This suggests that by the 17th century, Awa&#x27;s bon-odori was well established as a major event, lasting over three days—long enough to be a major disruption to the normal functioning of the city. It implies that samurai joined the festival alongside peasants and merchants, disgracing themselves with brawling and unseemly behaviour. In 1674, it was &quot;forbidden for dancers or spectators to carry swords (wooden or otherwise), daggers or poles&quot;. In 1685 revelers were prohibited from dancing after midnight and dancers were not allowed to wear any head or face coverings, suggesting that there were some serious public order concerns.

In the Meiji period (1868–1912) the festival died down as the Tokushima&#x27;s indigo trade, which had financed the festival, collapsed due to imports of cheaper chemical dyes. The festival was revitalised at the start of the Shōwa period (1926) when Tokushima Prefectural authorities first coined the name &quot;Awa Odori&quot; and promoted it as the region&#x27;s leading tourist attraction.

==Song==

The song associated with Awa Odori is called &quot;Awa Yoshikono&quot; and is a localised version of the Edo period popular song &quot;Yoshikono Bushi&quot;. Parts of it are sung, and others are chanted. The origins of the melodic part have been traced to Kumamoto, Kyūshū, but the Awa version came from Ibaraki Prefecture, from where it spread back down to Nagoya and Kansai. The lyrics of the first verse are:

&quot;Awa no tono sama Hachisuka-sama ga ima ni nokoseshi Awa Odori&quot;What Awa&#x27;s Lord Hachisuka left us to the present day is Awa Odori

The song is usually sung at a point in the parade where the dancers can stop and perform a stationary dance — for example a street intersection or in front of the ticketed, amplified stands which are set up at points around the city. Not every group has a singer, but dancers and musicians will frequently break out into the Awa Yoshikono chant as they parade through the streets:

The dancers also chant &quot;hayashi kotoba&quot; call and response patterns such as &quot;Ayattosa, Ayattosa&quot;, &quot;Hayaccha yaccha&quot;, &quot;Erai yaccha, erai yaccha&quot;, and &quot;Yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi&quot;. These calls have no semantic meaning but help to encourage the dancers.

== Dance ==

During the daytime a restrained dance called &quot;Nagashi&quot; is performed, but at night the dancers switch to a frenzied dance called &quot;Zomeki&quot;. As suggested by the lyrics of the chant, spectators are often encouraged to join the dance.

Men and women dance in different styles. For the men’s dance: right foot and right arm forward, touch the ground with toes, then step with right foot crossing over left leg. This is then repeated with the left leg and arm. Whilst doing this, the hands draw triangles in the air with a flick of the wrists, starting at different points. Men dance in a low crouch with knees pointing outwards and arms held above the shoulders.

The women&#x27;s dance uses the same basic steps, although the posture is quite different. The restrictive kimono allows only the smallest of steps forward but a crisp kick behind, and the hand gestures are more restrained and graceful, reaching up towards the sky. Women usually dance in tight formation, poised on the ends of their geta sandals.

Children and adolescents of both sexes usually dance the men&#x27;s dance. In recent years, it has become more common to see adult women, especially those in their 20s, dancing the men&#x27;s style of dance.

Some of the larger &quot;ren&quot; (dance groups) also have a &quot;yakko odori&quot;, or kite dance. This usually involves one brightly dressed, acrobatic dancer, darting backwards and forwards, turning cartwheels and somersaults, with freestyle choreography. In some versions, other male dancers crouch down forming a sinuous line representing the string, and a man at the other end mimes controlling the kite.

== Awa Dance Festivals elsewhere ==
Kōenji, an area of Tokyo, also has an Awa Dance Festival, modeled on Tokushima&#x27;s, which was started in 1956 by urban migrants from Tokushima Prefecture. It is the second largest Awa Dance Festival in Japan, with an average of 188 groups composed of 12,000 dancers, attracting 1.2 million visitors.

The Japanese production company Tokyo Story produced a version of Awa Odori in 2015 in Paris by bringing dancers from Japan in order to promote Awa Odori and the Japanese &quot;matsuri&quot; culture abroad.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Awa dance&quot; is a 2007 Japanese movie starring Nana Eikura. The festival is also prominently featured in the 2007 movie &quot;Bizan&quot; starring Matsushima Nanako. The novel series and anime &quot;Golden Time&quot; prominently features lead cast members along with their friends in their college club, the Japanese Festival Culture Research Society, performing the Awa dance multiple times during the story. Posters representing popular anime characters practicing the Awa dance are also printed every year for the festival. They featured &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, for example, in 2014.

In the 1994 Studio Ghibli film &quot;Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko&quot; (released as &quot;Pom Poko&quot; in English-speaking countries), during the scene where the film&#x27;s tanuki use their transformation magic to put on a parade of yokai, part of their display includes a procession of tiny Awa dancers.

<doc id="891099" wikidata="Q7716364" url="?curid=891099" title="The Beiderbecke Tapes">
<text>The Beiderbecke Tapes is a two-part British television drama serial written by Alan Plater and broadcast in 1987. It is the second serial in &quot;The Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot; and stars James Bolam and Barbara Flynn as schoolteachers Trevor Chaplin and Jill Swinburne.When a tape recording of a conversation about nuclear waste inadvertently falls into Trevor&#x27;s hands, Trevor and Jill find themselves being pursued by national security agents.

==Plot==
Trevor Chaplin teaches woodwork and likes to listen to jazz. Jill Swinburne teaches English and wants to help save the planet. They live together and just want a quiet life. Then they meet John the barman who died but is much better now. John gives them a tape, which leads to meeting Dave the wimp. They find out about The People&#x27;s Front for the Liberation of West Yorkshire. The man with no name called Mr Peterson came to see them. He was followed by the six men in grey suits. Jill goes to see The Oldest Suffragette in Town. Trevor and Jill go on a trip to Amsterdam with their class from &quot;San Quentin High&quot;. Trevor and Jill meet The Honourable Order of Elks who are &quot;looking for a bit of action&quot;.

The tone throughout is deliberately discursive and undramatic. Trevor and Jill are mistakenly given a secret tape recording, which results in their harassment by security forces, their home being invaded, their private lives used to discredit them at school and their being pursued all the way to Amsterdam and Edinburgh. Eventually the tapes are revealed as just a charade invented by shady government forces as a part of a disinformation campaign.

<text>The Beiderbecke Connection is a four-part British television serial written by Alan Plater and broadcast in 1988. It is the third and final part of &quot;The Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot; and stars James Bolam and Barbara Flynn as schoolteachers Trevor Chaplin and Jill Swinburne. Now with a baby in tow, Jill and Trevor are asked by Big Al to look after a refugee called &quot;Ivan&quot;.

==Plot==
Trevor Chaplin teaches woodwork and likes to listen to jazz. Jill Swinburne teaches English and wants to help save the planet. They live together and just want a quiet life. Since their last adventure in &quot;The Beiderbecke Tapes&quot;, Jill and Trevor have a child - Firstborn. Big Al asks them to put up a friend of his and they agree. But when Ivan arrives, they find he speaks no English but thinks that &quot;Bix is cool&quot;. Meetings with criminals, smuggling people over the border, fighting for the right to education even when it&#x27;s against the rules. These and other adventures are played out to a soundtrack of jazz music in the style of Bix Beiderbecke performed by Frank Ricotti with Kenny Baker as featured cornet soloist.

==Episodes==
As with &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot;, the four episodes are titled by incipit, that is, the title is simply the first spoken words heard in each episode.

*&quot;Oh Look, It&#x27;s Average-Sized Trevor Chaplin&quot; - Jill &amp; Trevor have produced Firstborn. They need a babysitter and get a refugee. Head for the border.
*&quot;Hello Sir, Hello Miss&quot; - The refugee is back from the border. Life goes on. Big Al and Little Norm make other plans. Trevor makes a stand.
*&quot;Is He the Lodger?&quot; - A face from the past. Criminals in the spare bed. The police take an interest. A day at the seaside.
*&quot;What Do We Have on Hockey Sticks?&quot; - Rocking the world on its axis. But life goes on for those that hear the music.

<doc id="891109" wikidata="Q17010114" url="?curid=891109" title="Military history of the Warsaw Uprising">
<text>The [[Warsaw Uprising]] began with simultaneous coordinated attacks at 17:00 hours on August 1, 1944 (W-hour). The uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived; however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight almost without any outside assistance. Initially the battle raged throughout most of Warsaw, but after a short time it became confined to districts in the West of the town. The key factor in the battle was the massive imbalance of weapons between the two sides. The German side was extremely well equipped whilst the Polish side had, initially, barely enough ammunition for a few days. The policy of &quot;one bullet, one German&quot; allowed the Polish fighters to sustain the uprising for many weeks at the cost of their own lives. Some areas fought for a full 63 days before an agreed capitulation took place. The losses on the Polish side amounted to 18,000 soldiers killed, 25,000 wounded and over 250,000 civilians killed; those on the German side amounted to over 17,000 soldiers killed and 9,000 wounded.

Although Stalingrad had already shown the level of danger which a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support to armies, the Warsaw uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against far better equipped professional soldiers— though at the cost of vast sacrifices on the part of the city&#x27;s residents.

== W-hour ==

&quot;W-hour&quot; (from the Polish &quot;wybuch&quot;, &quot;outbreak&quot; ), the moment of the start of the uprising, had been rescheduled for 1 August at 1700 during a briefing on 31 July around 1730.
The change of &quot;W-hour&quot; from 2400 (in earlier plans) to 1700 proved to be a costly strategic decision, reducing the chance of surprising the Germans, especially since many of the Polish partisans were not trained for prolonged day fighting. The order to start the uprising did not reach all of the units (around 23,000 personnel) due to the technological and logistic limitations of the underground movement.

==First moves==
Fighting broke out before the &quot;W-hour&quot; (scheduled for 1700) in several places where German units encountered organising Polish forces: around 1400 on Żoliborz, 1500 on Czerniaków, 1600 around Plac Napoleona, Hale Mirowskie, Plac Kercelego marketplace, Okopowa street and Mokotów.

Until &quot;W-hour&quot; those separate incidents were not generally perceived as part of a bigger plan. However, around 1600 SS-Standartenfuhrer Paul Otto Geibel, chief of police and SS in the Warsaw District, received a warning about the uprising from an anonymous &#x27;lieutenant of Luftwaffe&#x27;, who had in turn been warned about it by a Polish woman. He alerted the units under his command, which thus were prepared for the assault at 1700. This drastically reduced the element of surprise of the resistance. On the other hand, while the Germans had been considering the possibility of an uprising, they had no operational plans prepared for such an occasion.

The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:

&quot;Area I&quot; (Śródmieście, Stare Miasto): Units in that area captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture strong German pockets of resistance (the Warsaw University buildings, PAST skyscraper, or the headquarters of the German garrison at Piłsudski square). They thus failed to create a central stronghold and secure communications links for other areas. The main failures were in establishing a secure land connection with the northern area of Żoliborz through the northern railway line and the Cytadela fortress as well as failure to capture the bridges over Vistula. The forces mobilized in the city centre also failed to capture the German-only area near the &quot;Szucha&quot; avenue.

&quot;Area II&quot; (Żoliborz, Marymont, Bielany): Units here failed to secure the most important military targets in the area of Żoliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although the main body of the area was captured, the soldiers of colonel &quot;Żywiciel&quot; failed to capture the Cytadela fortress area and break through German defences at Warszawa Gdańska railway station. 
&quot;Area III&quot; (Wola): Units here initially succeeded in securing most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of colonel &quot;Radosław&quot; managed to capture the German barracks, the German supplies depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the Jewish cemetery. 
&quot;Area IV&quot; (Ochota): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the Warsaw concentration camp on &quot;Gęsia&quot; street, SS barracks and Sipo barracks located in former Students House on &quot;Narutowicz square&quot;, nicknamed Alcatraz). After suffering heavy casualties most of the forces of the Armia Krajowa retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under lieut. Gustaw stayed in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Units of Kedyw managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German resistance from the south and west.
&quot;Area V&quot; (Mokotów): The situation in this area was very serious from the beginning of hostilities. The partisans were to capture the heavily defended and fortified so-called Police Area (&quot;Dzielnica policyjna&quot;) on &quot;Rakowiecka&quot; street. Also, they were to establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at Pola Mokotowskie. None of this succeeded. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokotów, which was, however, severed from most communications routes to other areas.

&quot;Area VI&quot; (Praga): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula. The main task of the &quot;Area VI&quot; (&quot;Obwód VI&quot;) was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the situation was far worse than in other areas, there was no chance for any help from the outside. After some minor initial success, the forces of lt.col. Antoni Władysław Żurowski were badly outnumbered by the German forces concentrated there. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces located in the Praga area went underground. After the Soviets finally reached the right bank of the Vistula on September 10, the officers proposed recreating the pre-war 36th &#x27;Academic Legion&#x27; infantry regiment; however, they were all arrested by the NKVD and sent to Russia for interrogation.
&quot;Area VII&quot; (&quot;Powiat Warszawski&quot;): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.
&quot;Zgrupowanie Kedywu Komendy Głównej&quot;: These units secured parts of Śródmieście and Wola; along with the units of &quot;Area I&quot;, they were the most successful during the first few hours.

Many primary targets were not achieved on the first and subsequent days. Those included the early plans to capture the PAST building and failed attacks on Okęcie, Pola Mokotowskie and Warszawa Gdańska train station. After the first several hours of fighting many units adopted a more defensive strategy, while the civilian population started erecting barricades throughout the city.

==German reinforcements==
The Uprising reached its apogee on August 4 when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish frontlines in the Wola and Ochota districts. However, they failed to secure the bridges over the Vistula or bridgeheads on the other side of the river. Also, there were still several German pockets of resistance inside the Polish-controlled territory, most notably the PAST skyscraper, the bridgeheads, and Headquarters of the police.

On that very same day SS general Erich von dem Bach was appointed commander of all the forces fighting the uprising and began concentrating the newly arrived troops. These included Units of Dirlewanger, Schmidt and Reinefarth. The main aim of the German forces was to break through to the German bridgeheads and then cut off the Uprising from the river by attacking both southward and northward.

== &quot;Wola&quot; Massacre ==
On August 5 the three German groups started their advance westward along &quot;Wolska&quot; and &quot;Górczewska&quot; streets toward the main East-West communication line of Aleje Jerozolimskie Av. Their advance was halted, but the Reinefarth and Dirlewanger regiments started to carry out orders of Heinrich Himmler: behind the lines special groups of SS, police and Wehrmacht went from house to house shooting all inhabitants and burning their bodies. The aim of this policy was to crush the will to fight and put the uprising to an end without having to commit to heavy city fighting. In mass executions approximately 40,000 civilians were slaughtered. At the same time the &quot;Zośka&quot; and &quot;Wacek&quot; battalions managed to capture the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Warsaw concentration camp. The area became one of the main communication links between the insurgents fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town.

On August 7 the German forces were joined by tanks, with civilians being used as human shields. After two days of heavy fights they managed to cut Wola in two and reach the &quot;Bankowy&quot; square.

Until mid September, the Germans were shooting all captured resistance fighters on the spot. The main perpetrators were Oskar Dirlewanger and Bronislaw Kaminski, who committed the most cruel atrocities. After von dem Bachs arrived in Warsaw (August 7), it became clear that atrocities only stiffened the resistance and that some political solution should be found, considering the small forces at the disposal of the German commander. The aim was to gain a significant victory to show the Home Army the futility of further fighting and make them surrender. This did not succeed, but from the end of September on, some of the captured Polish soldiers were treated as POWs.

== &quot;Ochota&quot; Massacre ==

Simultaneously with the German attack on Wola, the Kaminski Brigade started its onslaught on the Ochota district. The forces defending the area consisted of only two ill-equipped battalions, while the Germans were aided by tanks, artillery and Goliath self-propelled mines. However, the morale of German troops fighting in the area was low, and the main aim of the soldiers fighting there was to loot and rape rather than to attack enemy positions. As a result, the two battalions of the Home Army were able to defend the area with heavy casualties until August 11, when they retreated toward Mokotów.

== Old Town ==
The Old Town area (Polish &quot;Starówka&quot; or &quot;Stare Miasto&quot;) was initially weak and almost undefended. However, it posed a great threat to the German-held bridgehead of the Kierbedź bridge. The Polish positions were close enough to the northern railway line and the Cytadela stronghold to prevent the Germans from effectively using them. Knowing that, the Germans planned to cut off the Old Town both from the north (attack along the railway line toward Vistula) and from the south (attack from the &quot;Bankowy&quot; sq. &quot;Most Kierbedzia&quot; bridge). On August 9 the German units from the Mariensztat area captured the Royal Castle, but failed to drive further inland. The Home Army counter-attacked and on August 12 forced the Germans out of &quot;Bankowy&quot; sq. However, German aerial bombardment and extensive usage of tanks imposed high casualties on both the defenders of the Old Town and the civilians. One of the first buildings to be bombed was a field hospital marked with a huge symbol of the Red Cross on the roof.
A German attack from the north was also halted with heavy casualties on both sides. Heavy city fighting started in the area of &quot;Plac Bankowy&quot;, with the square and the nearby barricade at &quot;Tłomackie&quot; street changing hands several times. The Germans managed to establish a link with the German forces under siege in the building of the German Garrison (&quot;Mostowski Palace&quot;) on August 15, but the huge building became a scene of heavy door-to-door and room-to-room fights. The fights lasted until August 18 when both sides withdrew from the ruins.

The no-mans-land and the covering positions of the Polish defence lines were composed of Warsaw Ghetto ruins and big open areas of &quot;Kercelego&quot; Square, &quot;Żytnia&quot; street and &quot;Leszno&quot; street. The Home Army was not well enough equipped to withstand a German armoured attack in open field. However, the main positions in the Old Town were densely urbanised and covered with small, narrow streets. Because of that, after initial successes in taking the outer rim, the German advance was halted. However, Germans amassed large numbers of artillery for the constant bombardment of the area behind Polish lines. According to von dem Bach himself the number of guns used in the bombardment was as follows:

* 220 guns of various calibres
* 1 heavy mortar Thor 610mm
* 50 Goliath self-propelled mines
* 1 company of Nebelwerfer 42/43
* 1 battery of Wurfgranate of various calibres (ranging from 150mm to 320mm)
* 4 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers operating from the Okęcie airport

The usage of heavy artillery and constant air bombardment (the planes from Okęcie airport needed only five minutes to reach their targets) inflicted heavy casualties on the civilians and destroy the city itself. This aim was expressed in direct orders of Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler and Heinz Guderian.

Despite German superiority, both technical and numerical, the Old Town was held until the end of August. However, the situation of both the Home Army and the civilians became critical: lack of food, water and munitions made further defence of the ruins impossible. Several plans to break through the German positions in &quot;Ogród Saski&quot; park to the downtown and through the northern railroad to Żoliborz failed. On September 2 the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the sewers. More than 5,300 men and women were evacuated using this way.

The front lines stabilised for a short while, but during the upcoming days and weeks the German counter-offensive would recapture Żoliborz and the Old Town, splitting the area held by the resistance into three separate sectors, connected only by underground canals.

== Sewers and barricades ==

The city sewer system became an important communication network for the insurgents, who used the sewers to move under the areas occupied by Germans, thus allowing contact between surrounded positions (insurgents had almost no radios). Sewers were also used as a means of evacuation of areas that couldn&#x27;t be defended any longer. Hand-to-hand fighting took place in the pitch blackness, the Germans throwing grenades and gas bombs down manhole covers.

==Soviet &quot;help&quot;: Berling&#x27;s landings at &quot;Powiśle&quot;==
In September the eastern part of Warsaw had been captured by the Soviets. In the Praga area Polish units under command of general Zygmunt Berling (thus sometimes known as &#x27;berlingowcy&#x27; - &#x27;the Berling men&#x27;), the 1st Polish Army (&quot;1 Armia Wojska Polskiego&quot;) were in position. On the night of 14/15 September three patrols landed on the shore of Czerniaków and Powiśle areas and made contact with Home Army forces. Under heavy German fire only small elements of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division). At the same time the commanders of the Red Army declined to support the Polish troops with artillery, tanks or bombers.

The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, which could seriously compromise their line of defence, but weren&#x27;t able to make any significant advances for several days, while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and during the next few days sustained heavy losses (including destruction of all landing boats and most of other river crossing equipment). Other Soviet units limited their assistance to sporadic and insignificant artillery and air support.

Shortly after the Berling landings, the Soviets decide to postpone all plans for a river crossing in Warsaw &quot;for at least 4 months&quot;, and soon afterwards General Berling was relieved of his command. On the night of September 19, after no further attempts from the other side of the river were made and the promised evacuation of wounded did not take place, Home Army soldiers and landed elements of Wojsko Polskie were forced to begin a retreat from the positions on the bank of the river.

Out of approximately 3,000 men who made it ashore only around 900 made it back to the eastern shores of Vistula, approximately 600 of them seriously wounded.

== Airdrops ==
From 4 August the Western Allies begun supporting the Warsaw Uprising with airdrops of munitions and other supplies. Initially the air supply operations were carried out mostly by Polish bomber units (Polish Special Duty Squadron 1586) stationed in Bari and Brindisi in Italy. Later on at the insistence of the Polish government-in-exile they were joined by South African and British units. The drops continued until 21 September. The total weight of allied drops was 104 tons.

The Soviet Union did not give permission to the Allies for use of its airfields for those supply operations; thus the planes were forced to use distant bases in the United Kingdom and Italy, which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies&#x27; specific request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August (he referred to the resistance as &#x27;a handful of criminals&#x27;).

United States planes did not join the operation. After Stalin&#x27;s objections to support for the uprising, Churchill telegrammed Roosevelt on August 25, proposing to send planes in defiance of Stalin and &#x27;see what happens&#x27;. Roosevelt replied on August 26: &#x27;I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe&#x27;.

Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent, except for elements of JG52, the highest-scoring fighter squadron (&quot;geschwader&quot;) in the Luftwaffe, which claimed its 10,000th kill of the war on a Soviet plane over the Warsaw suburb of Praga, about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost. Most of the drops were made at night-time, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded in German-controlled territory.

From 13 September on the Soviets begun their own airdrop raids with supplies, and dropped about 55 tons in total. The drops continued until 28 September. Since the Soviet airmen did not equip the containers with parachutes, the majority of recovered packages were damaged.

Finally on 18 September the Soviets allowed one USAAF flight of 110 B-17s of the 3 division Eighth Air Force to re-fuel at Soviet airfields used in Operation Frantic, but it was too little too late. A large air-drop from high altitude fell predominantly into German hands.

Of the total of 239 tons of supplies dropped during the 8 weeks by 306 planes of the western Allies, only 88 Tons (36.8%) actually reached the Home Army in Warsaw, the Kabacki woods and the Kampinos forest. The remainder fell into enemy hands or was lost.

==Capitulation==
At 8 pm on 2 October General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski signed the capitulation of remaining Polish forces in Warsaw (&quot;Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej&quot; or Home Army Warsaw Corps) at the German headquarters in the presence of General von dem Bach. According to the capitulation treaty the Home Army soldiers were to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and the civilian population was to be treated humanely.

==Early life==
Ifans was born Rhys Owain Evans in Haverfordwest on 22 July 1967, the son of nursery school teacher Beti-Wyn (née Davies) and primary school teacher Eirwyn Evans. His younger brother, Llŷr Ifans, is also an actor. He grew up in Ruthin, where he received his primary education at Ysgol Pentrecelyn and was raised speaking Welsh as his first language. He attended Ysgol Maes Garmon, a Welsh medium secondary school in Mold, where he took his O levels and A levels. He attended acting classes at Theatr Clwyd. After leaving school, he presented Welsh-language television programmes on S4C. He studied acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he graduated in 1997.

==Career==
===Stage===
Ifans&#x27; early stage work included &quot;Hamlet&quot; at Theatr Clwyd, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Regent&#x27;s Park Theatre, and &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; and &quot;Volpone&quot; at the National Theatre. He appeared at the Donmar Warehouse in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Accidental Death of an Anarchist&quot;. In 2006, he returned to the London stage in Michael Grandage&#x27;s production of &quot;Don Juan in Soho&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse. In 2016, Ifans played Fool alongside Glenda Jackson in Deborah Warner&#x27;s production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, at The Old Vic. He returned to The Old Vic to play Ebenezer Scrooge in Matthew Warchus&#x27; production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (adapted by Jack Thorne) in 2017 and in 2018 returned to the National Theatre to play King Berenger in Patrick Marber&#x27;s new adaptation of Eugene Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;Exit the King&quot;. Ifans was given the role of Atticus Finch in Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; to begin at London&#x27;s Gielgud Theatre on 21 May 2020. The play was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic but was rescheduled for May 2021. The role of Atticus Finch was later given to Rafe Spall due to scheduling conflicts.

===Television===
Ifans appeared in many Welsh-language television programmes before embarking on his film career, including the comedy show &quot;&quot;, as well as performing at the National Theatre, London and the Royal Exchange, Manchester. In 1990, he presented &quot;Stwnsh&quot; (Welsh for &quot;Mash&quot;), an anarchic children&#x27;s quiz programme; 31 fifteen-minute programmes were broadcast on Welsh-language TV channel S4C.

In 2000, he narrated the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Sali Mali&quot; for S4C. In 2004, his performance as Peter Cook in the TV film &quot;Not Only But Always&quot; won him the BAFTA Best Actor at the 2005 British Academy Television Awards.

In 2005, Ifans made a guest appearance for the rock band Oasis in the video for their single &quot;The Importance of Being Idle&quot; (where he mimed to Noel Gallagher&#x27;s vocals), for which he accepted their award for Video of the Year at the 2006 NME Awards. He has also appeared in the music videos for &quot;God! Show Me Magic&quot; and &quot;Hometown Unicorn&quot; by Super Furry Animals, &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot; by Catatonia, and &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot; by Tom Jones with Stereophonics.

In 2008, he appeared in &quot;Six Days One June&quot;, one of three episodes of the TV series &quot;The Last Word Monologues&quot;, written by Hugo Blick and broadcast on BBC Two. He played a lonely Welsh farmer trying to free himself from a domineering mother.

From 2016 to 2019, Ifans portrayed hard-nosed American CIA case officer Hector DeJean in the U.S. pay-cable Epix network espionage thriller drama series &quot;Berlin Station&quot;, filmed on location in Berlin.

Ifans plays Otto Hightower in the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; prequel &quot;House of the Dragon&quot;, which premiered 21 August 2022.

===Film===
Following his role as Jeremy Lewis in the Swansea-based movie &quot;Twin Town&quot; (1997) alongside his brother Llŷr, Ifans gained international exposure in his role as slovenly housemate Spike in the British film &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999). Reportedly, in preparation for the role, Ifans did not wash himself or brush his teeth. He played Adrian, the pompous eldest brother in &quot;Little Nicky&quot; (2000). Other film roles include: Eyeball Paul in &quot;Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large&quot; (2000), Nigel in &quot;The Replacements&quot; (2000), Iki in &quot;The 51st State&quot; (2001), William Dobbin in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (2004), and Vladis Grutas in &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; (2007). He played Jed Parry in the 2004 film version of Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Enduring Love&quot;, and the lead role in &quot;Danny Deckchair&quot; (2003) as Danny Morgan.

Ifans revealed in March 2009 that he was to appear in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; (2010). He played Xenophillius Lovegood, editor of the wizarding magazine &quot;The Quibbler&quot; and father of the eccentric Luna Lovegood. In the same interview, he announced that he would play the title role in the film &quot;Mr. Nice&quot;, based on the life of the drug smuggler Howard Marks. He played Nemo Nobody&#x27;s father in &quot;Mr. Nobody,&quot; and a villain in &quot;Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang&quot;.

On 11 October 2010 Associated Press confirmed that Ifans would portray the villain in the Spider-Man reboot film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. The villain was revealed as the Curt Connors / Lizard a few days later, and the film was released in July 2012. In 2015, Ifans starred in &quot;She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;, directed by Peter Bogdanovich.

Ifans also starred in Steven Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Last Call&quot;, which was released theatrically, followed an extremely long delay, in the US on 25 November 2020. It is a surrealistic biopic, which recreates the life of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas through flashbacks during the famous drinking binge at the White Horse Tavern in New York City which ended fatally during the fall of 1953. It stars Ifans as Thomas alongside John Malkovich, Rodrigo Santoro, Romola Garai, Zosia Mamet, and Tony Hale.

On 16 November 2021 it was revealed, through the film&#x27;s official trailer, that Ifans would reprise his role as Lizard from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, to be released on 17 December. Later it was revealed that Ifans was not actually present on set and only lent his voice for the character created through digital means, with his human form at the end of the film being from archival footage from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;.

Ifans also appeared as Grigori Rasputin in the spy film &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot;, which was released in December 2021.
===Music===
Ifans was briefly lead vocalist of the rock band Super Furry Animals before they released any records.

Since 2007, Ifans has sung with the psychedelic rock band The Peth (&quot;peth&quot; is Welsh for &quot;thing&quot;), featuring Super Furry Animals&#x27; Dafydd Ieuan, which played a number of concert dates in south Wales and in London in the autumn of 2008. In 2009 the band supported Oasis at a concert in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

==Personal life==
Ifans dated actress Sienna Miller from 2007 to 2008; Miller had accepted Ifans&#x27;s marriage proposal before breaking up with him. He dated actress Anna Friel from 2011 to 2014.

In September 2012, Ifans became a patron of the Welsh-language Wikipedia, together with then Archbishop of Wales Barry Morgan. In 2017, Ifans partnered with Shelter Cymru in a campaign called 7 Ways You Can End Homelessness. He also in 2017 supported the community purchase of Tafarn Sinc, a pub in his native Pembrokeshire that was facing closure.

<doc id="891117" wikidata="Q4162315" url="?curid=891117" title="Discount card">
<text>A discount card is a card or document, often a plastic credit card or paper card, that entitles the holder to discounts on the prices of some products or services. 

== How it works ==
Cards may be issued as part of a loyalty program, offering discounts to existing customers to ensure their continuing custom; they may be offered free of charge, offering a modest discount with the intention of persuading purchasers to patronise participating shops; or they may be sold to members, offering larger discounts—for example, the tastecard offers 50% discounts at many restaurants—at a substantial annual cost. Cards may be offered by merchants or groups of merchants, by clubs or associations who negotiate on behalf of all members to obtain benefits, or by official organisations offering concessionary prices to qualifying groups, such as the disabled.

==Types==
* Loyalty cards
* Cards giving entitlement to educational discount. In many cases, a discount may be offered on proof of student status, without a special card.
* Cards giving entitlement to military discount. In many cases, a discount may be offered on proof of current or former membership of a military service, without a special card.
* Cards giving entitlement to disability discount. In many cases, a discount may be offered on proof of disability, without a special card.
* Proof of age card, a card which certifies the age of the holder. This type of card may, for example, be used by older children for free or discounted travel on public transport. Cards of this type are also used to certify that people of youthful appearance are old enough to legally buy, for example, tobacco and alcoholic beverages.

<doc id="891118" wikidata="Q2711323" url="?curid=891118" title="Stellastarr">
<text>Stellastarr (styled as stellastarr*) is an American indie rock band based in New York City. Its members were Shawn Christensen (vocals, rhythm guitar), Amanda Tannen (bass, vocals), Arthur Kremer (drums, percussion, keyboards), and Michael Jurin (lead guitar, vocals).

==History==
The band was formed in March 2000 from a previous musical effort, the band Ghistor, formed while studying art and design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. A few years later, after a chance meeting with Jurin, who had recently relocated to Brooklyn and had left his former band Charlotte&#x27;s Funeral behind in his hometown of Philadelphia, the former classmates reunited, this time with Christensen on vocals. The band was named after an old purple hearse parked in Poughkeepsie, where Christensen grew up.

Stellastarr played its first gig at Luna Lounge, formerly on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in July 2000, and released a limited series of independent/homemade EP CDs shortly thereafter. The band has toured with Jane&#x27;s Addiction, The Raveonettes, Placebo, The Killers, and Editors. Stellastarr has played live in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Europe.

The third album, &quot;Civilized&quot;, was released in July 2009 on the band&#x27;s own label, Bloated Wife. &quot;Graffiti Eyes&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot; are the singles, the last one has a B-side that includes &quot;Winter Song&quot;. Since the release of the album, the band has been on indefinite hiatus.

Members of the band have collaborated with Project Runway winner Christian Siriano and his boyfriend, musician Brad Walsh on music for Siriano&#x27;s runway shows at fashion week. Michael Jurin played guitar on Walsh&#x27;s song &quot;Pop&quot; which was the runway music in 2009, and Amanda Tannen contributed vocals to the song &quot;I Got What U Need&quot; on Walsh&#x27;s 2009 album. Arthur is currently involved in a project titled Dear Comrade, which released its first LP in 2011.

==Other projects==
All members of the band have alternate careers.

Frontman Shawn Christensen is an Academy Award winning filmmaker having won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for his 2012 short &quot;Curfew&quot; at the 85th Academy Awards. Christensen is also a professional painter. His award-winning art has been displayed at various New York exhibits and published in journals like Metropolis and The Village Voice. He painted the portraits inside the album artwork for the group&#x27;s eponymous debut album.

Bassist Amanda Tannen is a member of the Los Angeles–based band Cheekface, a graphic designer, and created the album art for the third album, &quot;Civilized&quot;.

Guitarist Michael Jurin is a member of the Philadelphia-based band The Midnight Sounds, creates his own music under the name Piano Belly and has scored various short independent movies.

Drummer Arthur Kremer is a graphic designer, and a founding member of a Brooklyn band called Dear Comrade, and acted in &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot;.

<doc id="891127" wikidata="Q7490395" url="?curid=891127" title="Sharper">
<text>A sharper is an older term, common since the seventeenth-century, for thieves who use trickery to part an owner with his or her money or other possessions. Sharpers vary from what are now known as con-men by virtue of the simplicity of their cons, which often were impromptu, rather than carefully orchestrated, though those certainly happened as well. The 1737 &quot;Dictionary of Thieving Slang&quot; defines a sharper as &quot;A Cheat, One who lives by his wits&quot;. In the nineteenth century, and into today, the term is more closely associated with gambling.

Sharpers were romantic figures in the eighteenth-century, valued as imaginative figures for their perceived social independence and ability to create new social networks of gangs. The appeal of an independent society, operating outside the law, has been imaginatively evocative for centuries, but in eighteenth-century London philosophical thought, influenced by Thomas Hobbes and Rousseau&#x27;s new formulations of social contract, the romanticization of thievery reached new levels. John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; and Henry Fielding&#x27;s novel &quot;Jonathan Wild&quot; are only two examples of sharpers as heroes, in these cases, to provide satirical ammunition against Robert Walpole, the British Prime Minister.

<text>Ivy was an American indie pop band composed of Andy Chase, Adam Schlesinger, and Dominique Durand. They were active between 1994 and 2012.

==History==

=== Formation and debut projects ===
In 1991, Andy Chase placed an ad that attracted fellow multi-instrumentalist Adam Schlesinger. In 1994 they met Dominique Durand, a native of Paris who had moved to New York City to study English, and with whom they shared admiration for the Go-Betweens, the House of Love, the Pastels, Prefab Sprout and the Smiths. Although Durand had never sung in a group, she was persuaded by Chase and Schlesinger to sing on some demos, and Ivy was formed.

In 1994, Ivy signed with Seed Records and released &quot;Get Enough,&quot; which the UK magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named Single of the Week, followed by the EP &quot;Lately&quot;. In 1995, they released their first full-length album, &quot;Realistic.&quot; &quot;Lately&quot;&#x27;s cover version of &quot;I Guess I&#x27;m Just a Little Too Sensitive&quot; impressed its author, Edwyn Collins of Orange Juice, so much that he invited them to tour together. Ivy also toured during this period with Lloyd Cole, Madder Rose, and Saint Etienne.

===&quot;Apartment Life&quot;===
&quot;Apartment Life&quot; (released October 6, 1997 on Atlantic Records) was praised by critics as one of the year&#x27;s best albums and established Ivy as a band that wrote pleasant, well-crafted pop songs. They were assisted by several guest musicians, including Lloyd Cole, James Iha, Dean Wareham and Chris Botti. The album received more attention when &quot;This Is the Day&quot; and &quot;I Get the Message&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;.

&quot;Apartment Life&quot;, however, did not produce any hits, and Ivy was dropped by Atlantic. They signed with 550 Music on the condition that the band reissue the album. According to Schlesinger, four of the songs were remixed and the album was remastered and re-released on October 7, 1998.

===&quot;Long Distance&quot;===
&quot;Long Distance&quot;, their third LP, was released on July 10, 2001 on Nettwerk, and won the group a wider audience both at home and abroad. The album was released on November 8, 2000 in Japan, seven months prior to its US release, and the Japanese edition included a bonus track, &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Mind&quot; (the US version included The Blow Monkeys cover &quot;Digging Your Scene&quot; as a bonus track instead).

On &quot;Long Distance&quot;, lush soundscapes and dense rhythm tracks were brought to the fore, and bouncy pop songs were outnumbered by moodier, more atmospheric songs like single &quot;Edge of the Ocean&quot;. Promotional videos were created for that song and the lead single, &quot;Lucy Doesn&#x27;t Love You&quot;.

By this time, the band had also found success on both the big and small screens, scoring the Farrelly Brothers’ &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;, as well as having their songs featured prominently in numerous films and television shows. Chase and Schlesinger had also begun to receive attention for their work outside the band: Chase produced the debut album by French pop group Tahiti 80, which was a hit in many countries and led to production work with several other groups; Schlesinger’s other band, Fountains of Wayne, released two critically acclaimed records, and he also received an Oscar nomination for his title song to Tom Hanks&#x27;s film &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;.

===&quot;Guestroom&quot;===
Ivy released &quot;Guestroom&quot; on September 10, 2002 on Minty Fresh. The album contained 10 of the group&#x27;s favorite cover songs, including The Cure&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot;, House of Love&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Why I Love You&quot;, Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Only a Fool Would Say That&quot;, Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Anamour&quot; (previously a B-side on the &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; single), The Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and Papas Fritas&#x27; &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;. Picking from several different eras, they revealed some of their sources of inspiration, and also displayed their ability to reinterpret many different types of songs in their own distinct way. Five of the 10 songs on &quot;Guestroom&quot; were recorded during one group of sessions in New York. The remaining five tracks were recorded at different times over the course of Ivy’s career, but were difficult to find, having been released only on limited-edition singles, compilations or soundtracks.

&quot;Digging Your Scene&quot; was also included on the album, and released in Japan and UK as a CD single. A video for &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot; was shot, depicting Durand and Chase in their NYC apartment, later joined by Iha.

The &quot;Lately&quot; EP was reissued in 2003 on Unfiltered Records with the same track list as the original.

Ivy gained even wider recognition in 2003–2004 for their song &quot;Worry About You&quot;, which was used as the theme song of the Stephen King series &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; and in the pilot episode of the television series &quot;The 4400&quot;.

===&quot;In the Clear&quot;===
&quot;In the Clear&quot; was released on March 1, 2005 on Nettwerk.

Ivy brought in UK producer Steve Osborne (New Order, Happy Mondays, Starsailor, Elbow) for his first-ever New York sessions to mix seven of the tracks.

&quot;In the Clear&quot; also featured guest appearances by friends like Iha, Porter, Brazilian string arranger Zé Luis (Bebel Gilberto, Caetano Veloso), and former Girls Against Boys frontman Scott McLoud, who dueted with Durand on the closing track, &quot;Feel So Free&quot;.

The album was given a warmer reception than previous releases. An animated promotional video clip was created for &quot;Thinking About You&quot;.

===&quot;All Hours&quot;===
&quot;All Hours&quot; was released on September 20, 2011 on Nettwerk. The first single from the album, &quot;Distant Lights&quot;, was released on June 7, 2011, and the second single, &quot;Fascinated,&quot; was released on July 26, 2011. The third and final single, &quot;Lost in the Sun&quot;, was released on April 10, 2012.

==Influences==
Ivy have cited the Go-Betweens, Burt Bacharach, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Orange Juice, the Smiths, the Velvet Underground, the Beatles and Françoise Hardy as influences, as well as other artists covered on &quot;Guestroom&quot;.

Durand&#x27;s vocal technique and Parisian pronunciation are often compared by reviewers to another French singer, Lætitia Sadier of Stereolab.

==Other work==
Along with Fountains of Wayne, Schlesinger was a member of Tinted Windows.

Durand and Chase, with Michael Hampton, recorded one album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;This Is Where We Live&quot;, as Paco.

Chase&#x27;s solo project, Brookville, released three albums: &quot;Wonderfully Nothing&quot; (2003), &quot;Life in the Shade&quot; (2006) and &quot;Broken Lights&quot; (2009). In November 2012, Brookville changed their name to Camera2, releasing the &quot;Just About Made It&quot; single, followed by EP releases in 2013 and 2014.

In his video &quot;How Music Should Sound,&quot; Rick Beato mentioned he played with the band for &quot;about six weeks&quot; in 1994.

<doc id="891132" wikidata="Q672287" url="?curid=891132" title="Greater Somalia">
<text>Greater Somalia sometimes also called Greater Somaliland (; ) is the geographic location comprising the regions in the Horn of Africa in which ethnic Somalis live and have historically inhabited.During the Scramble for Africa at the end of the 19th century, Somali inhabited territories were partitioned between imperial powers. The unification of these territories became a focal objective of an independent Somalia. Referred to as &#x27;Greater Somalia&#x27;, these regions at the outset of Somali independence encompassed British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland, which had successfully merged into a single nation in 1960. French Somaliland, the Northern Frontier District (NFD) in Kenya and the Ogaden region in Ethiopia were placed under the control of neighboring states, despite the pre-independence unification efforts of Somali nationalists.

The post-independence governments of the Somali Republic (1960-1969) and the Somali Democratic Republic (1969-1991) expended significant effort towards the unification of the NFD and French Somaliland with Somalia, however their primary focus was the Ogaden region, which had been occupied by Ethiopia since Menelik&#x27;s invasions in the 1890s. From 1960 and onwards, Somalis in Ethiopia seeking their self-determination have waged several insurgencies with the support of neighboring Somalia, escalating into several major interstate conflicts including the Ogaden War in Ethiopia and the Shifta War in Kenya.

However, following of breakout of the Somali Civil War and the splintering of Somalia into various autonomous polities, the concept of Greater Somalia has seen a sharp decline in support, with some Somali diaspora communities advocating for autonomy or independence rather than a full fledged union.

== History ==
Since the beginning of the 20th century the concept of Greater Somalia started to be developed with the birth of the nation of Somalia, as a united country inhabited by all the Somalis in their &quot;Horn of Africa&quot; areas. &quot;Pan-Somalism&quot; refers to the vision of reunifying these areas to form a single Somali nation. The pursuit of this goal has led to conflict: Somalia engaged after World War II in the Ogaden War with Ethiopia over the Somali Region, and supported Somali insurgents against Kenya. In 1946 the Somali Youth League selected Harar as the future capital of Greater Somalia and subsequently sent delegates to the United Nations office in Mogadishu to reveal this proposal.
===Italian Somaliland ===
Italians occupied the Benadir in 1890 and soon started to enlarge their &quot;Somalia italiana&quot; (Italian Somaliland): they created their colony in the first years of the 20th century.

During World War I, Britain secretly reached an agreement with Italy to transfer to the Italians 94,050 square kilometers of the Jubaland protectorate, which was situated in present-day southwestern Somalia. This was Italy&#x27;s reward for allying itself with Britain in its war against Germany. The treaty was honored, and in 1924, Britain ceded Jubaland. 
In 1926, the northern half of Jubaland was incorporated into Italian Somaliland, and was later re-dubbed &quot;Oltre Giuba&quot; by the Italians. Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later merged into the Northern Frontier District (NFD).

After its conquest of Ethiopia in 1936, Italy also annexed the Huwan region. In this way Italian Somaliland, with capital Mogadishu, was enlarged once more.

In early World War II, Italian troops invaded British Somaliland and ejected the British. Benito Mussolini annexed the conquered area to the Italian Somalia and added even the area of Moyale and Buna near the Jubaland in eastern Kenya (with some southern borders of French Somalia). 

In August 1940 Mussolini boasted to a group of Somalis in Rome that with the conquest of British Somalia (that he annexed to Italian Somalia) nearly all the Somali people were united, fulfilling their dream of a union of all Somalis. In September 1940 he even announced to the Somali people in Italy of having created an Italian &quot;Grande Somalia&quot; inside his Italian Empire.

Indeed, in early World War II, Italian troops invaded British Somaliland and ejected the British. However, Britain retained administration of most of the Northern Frontier District. Italians even did a tentative to occupy French Somaliland in summer 1940.

However the British regained control of British Somaliland in the spring of 1941, and conquered Italian Somaliland and the Somali Region. In 1945, the Potsdam conference was held, where it was decided not to return Italian Somaliland to Italy. The UN opted instead in 1949 to grant Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland for a period of ten years, after which time the region would be independent.

Meanwhile, in 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of Somalis, the British &quot;returned&quot; the &quot;Haud&quot; (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably &quot;protected&quot; by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Somali Region to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help in evacuating British garrisons in the Sudan. Britain included the proviso that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands that it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the Northern Frontier District to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region&#x27;s population to join the newly formed Somali Republic, predominantly the North Eastern region. 

===Somali Republic===
The first armed conflict following the independence and unification of the former British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland territories, known collectively as the Somali Republic, began in 1963 in an ethnic Oromo and Somali district, Elekere, then part of Bale province, instigated by the Oromo founder of the United Liberation Forces of Oromia, Waqo Gutu. The Bale revolt, a peasant revolt stemming from issues involving land, taxation, class, and religion, raged in the province for several years until a number of developments took the energy out of the militants, as well as the decision of Somali Prime Minister Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal to focus his country&#x27;s resources on economic development. Rebels began to surrender to the Ethiopian government at the end of 1969; Waqo Gutu, who had been the foremost of the insurgents, was surrounded with his command of barely 200 men in Arana by the Ethiopian army in February 1970 and surrendered. Pacification was complete by the next year.

Djibouti gained its independence in 1977, but a referendum was held in 1958 on the eve of Somalia&#x27;s independence in 1960 to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favor of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined &quot;yes&quot; vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. However, the majority of those who voted &quot;no&quot; were Somalis who were strongly in favor of joining a united Somalia as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later, and Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali who campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, wound up as Djibouti&#x27;s first president post-independence (1977–1991).

Between 1977 and 1978, Somalia and Ethiopia waged a war over control of the predominantly Somali Ogaden region. In 1978 and with the help of Soviet and Cuban troops, Ethiopian troops drove back the Somali army from the Ogaden, effectively marking the end of the Ogaden War. In 1981, Siad Barre visited Nairobi, and asserted that Somalia was suspending its claim on the North Eastern Province (NFD). Improved relations with Kenya led to the signing of a pact in December 1984 agreeing to cease hostilities along the border. Following renewed hostilities in the Ogaden with an August 1982 border clash, Ethiopia and Somalia signed a peace treaty in 1988.

== Somali Civil War ==
With the start of the Somali Civil War, the vision of uniting the various historically and predominantly Somali-inhabited areas of the Horn of Africa into a Greater Somalia was temporarily sidelined. Thousands of refugees have been granted political asylum in Kenya. Talk of pan-Somali unification movements for the moment took a backseat, as the Republic splintered into a few autonomous smaller regional or clan-based governing zones. The northern regions of the Somali Republic, which previously was a British protectorate, declared independence as the Republic of Somaliland in 1991, shattering the dream of a greater Somalia now that the two regions that previously united split apart. Though there was no 
unified government and thus no formal policy towards irredentism, individual militia leaders clashed with Ethiopian troops between 1998 and 2000.

=== Islamic Courts Union ===
In late 2006, Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, head of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) which then controlled much of southern Somalia, declared;

<text>Inishowen () is a peninsula in the north of County Donegal in Ireland. Inishowen is the largest peninsula on the island of Ireland.

The Inishowen peninsula includes Ireland&#x27;s most northerly point, Malin Head. The Grianan of Aileach, a ringfort that served as the royal seat of the over-kingdom of Ailech, stands at the entrance to the peninsula.

==Towns and villages ==

The main towns and villages of Inishowen are:
* Ballyliffin, Buncrana, Bridgend, Burnfoot, Burt
* Carndonagh, Carrowmenagh, Clonmany, Culdaff
* Dunaff
* Fahan
* Glengad, Gleneely, Greencastle 
* Malin, Malin Head, Moville, Muff
* Redcastle
* Shrove
* Quigley&#x27;s Point
* Urris

==Geography==

Inishowen is a peninsula of 884.33 square kilometres (218,523 acres), situated in the northernmost part of the island of Ireland. It is bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by Lough Foyle, and to the west by Lough Swilly. It is joined at the south to the rest of the island and is mostly in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. The south-eastern part of the peninsula lies in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, having been transferred from County Donegal at the behest of the London companies as part of the Plantation of Ulster in the early 17th century. The peninsula is separated from the rest of Northern Ireland by the River Foyle.

After the last ice age, the peninsula was an island. Most of Inishowen&#x27;s population inhabits the peripheral coastal areas, while the interior consists of low mountains, mostly covered in bogland, the highest of which is Slieve Snaght, which is 619 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Other major hills are located in the Malin Head peninsula, as well as the Urris Hills in west Inishowen. Due to its geography, Inishowen usually has relatively more moderate weather conditions, with temperatures slightly lower than in other parts of Ireland in summer and slightly warmer in winter, especially during extended cold weather periods.

Inishowen has several harbours, some of which are used for commercial fishing purposes, including Greencastle, Bunagee and Leenan. A seasonal ferry service crosses the Foyle, connecting Greencastle with Magilligan in County Londonderry, while another crosses the Swilly, connecting Buncrana with Rathmullan. The village of Fahan has a privately built marina.

There are several small outlying islands off the Inishowen coast, most notably Inishtrahull and Glashedy islands, both uninhabited, although the former was inhabited until the early twentieth century. Inch, located in Lough Swilly, is technically no longer an island, as it has a causeway connecting it to the mainland at Tooban, south of Fahan.

Lough Swilly is a fjord-like lough, and was of strategic importance for many years to the British Empire as a deep-water harbour. It is also famous as the departure point of the Flight of the Earls. Lough Foyle is important as the entrance to the river Foyle, and the city of Derry, but is much shallower than Lough Swilly, and requires the use of a guide boat to guide ships to and from Londonderry Port.

A large area of land, most of which now forms part of &quot;Grianán Farm&quot;, one of the largest farms in Ireland, was reclaimed from a shallow area of Lough Swilly, stretching from the village of Burnfoot to Bridgend and Burt. The outline of this land is plainly visible due to its flatness, showing a marked contrast to the more mountainous area surrounding it.

==History==

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century) described a point called Ουεννικνιον (&quot;Wenniknion&quot;, perhaps from *&quot;wen&quot;- &quot;friends&quot;) which probably referred to Inishowen.

Predating the formation of County Donegal by centuries, the area was named &quot;Inis Eoghain&quot; (the Island of Eoghan) after Eógan mac Néill, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages (&quot;Niall Naoigeallach&quot;, a High King of Ireland), whose name was also used for Tyrone (Irish: &quot;Tír Eoghain&quot;). Inis Eoghain is also the ancient homeland of the Meic Lochlainn (descended from the tribe of Eoghan), a clan that grew so formidable that they eventually came under siege by a Limerick King, who came north to Aileach, and ordered the destruction of Aileach fort, and that each soldier was to carry away a stone from the fort in order to prevent its rebuilding. Later, after the decline of the Meic Lochlainn, the Norman Earldom of Ulster expanded into Inishowen, founding Greencastle in the process. After the Bruce invasion in the early 14th century, the Ó Dochartaigh clan (descended from the tribe of Conaill), gradually conquered it as they lost their own homeland in the Laggan, a district in the east of Tír Conaill.

Inishowen has many historical monuments, dating back to early settlements, including the ruins of several castles, and the fort at Grianán Aileach. The ancient Grianán Ailigh fort at Burt was the one-time seat of the High Kings of Ireland, including both High Kings of the Meic Lochlainn, who held power in Inis Eoghain for many centuries. It was restored in the nineteenth century, although some damage in recent years has resulted in the partial collapse of the south side wall. Among the main castle ruins of Inishowen are Carrickabraghey on the Isle of Doagh, the Norman Castle at Greencastle, Inch Castle, Buncrana Castle and Elagh Castle.

In 1196, John de Courcy, an Anglo-Norman knight who had invaded Ulster in 1177, defeated the King of the Cenél Conaill and most of County Donegal was at his mercy. Two years later he returned to devastate Inishowen. However, in subsequent campaigns de Courcy was defeated by Clan O&#x27;Neill and their Chief Áed Méith and found himself unable to conquer the western part of Ulster.

In 1608 Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty, the Chief of the Name of Clan O&#x27;Doherty and Lord of Inishowen, launched O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion by burning Derry. After the defeat of the uprising, most of Clan O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s territory was awarded to Arthur Chichester. In 1990, an O&#x27;Doherty clan ceremony was held in Derry, during which Ramon Salvador O&#x27;Dogherty of Spain was installed as ceremonial &quot;Lord of Inishowen&quot; and received a traditional white wand of office.

Ireland&#x27;s deadliest road accident happened at Inishowen in July 2010.

==Demographics==
At the last Census of Ireland in 2016, Inishowen counted a population of 40,544 Buncrana is the largest town in Inishowen, with a 2016 population of 6,785 in its urban area.

==Politics==
On a national level, Inishowen forms part of the Donegal constituency, which elects five TDs to Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament). At the county level, Inishowen is an electoral area, a Municipal District, electing nine councillors to Donegal County Council. Currently there are three members of Fianna Fáil, two each of Sinn Féin and Fine Gael, one from the Labour Party and one independent.

==Media==
In addition to the radio stations and newspapers available elsewhere in Donegal, there are several media outlets that are based solely on the peninsula, including two newspapers (the &quot;Inish Times&quot; and the &quot;Inishowen Independent&quot;, both of which are published in Buncrana) and one online daily local news service (InishowenNews.com). The traditional news source for Inishowen is the &quot;Derry Journal&quot;, published in nearby Derry city, since 1772. It still serves the peninsula as a paper of record.

==Tourism==

Inishowen is at the starting (or ending) point of the Wild Atlantic Way.

The Inishowen 100 tourist route is an approximately 100-mile signposted scenic drive around the peninsula. It takes in or passes nearby many of the tourist sights and places of interest on the peninsula. It starts at Bridgend where there is a lay-by with a large map and information boards. The first leg of the coastal route is along the coast of Lough Swilly. It passes Inch Island, Fahan (a blue flag beach), Fahan 18-hole Golf Course, Buncrana Town, Tullyarvan Mill (An interpretive centre tracing over 250 years of textile production in the Buncrana area.). It continues along the western coast on Lough Swilly. The route passes Dunree beach, Dunree Fort (military museum) and then turns inland for Mamore Gap (between the Urris Hills and Raghtin More mountain), Leenan Bay, Dunaff, Head, Tullagh Bay (a blue flag beach), through the villages of Clonmany and Ballyliffin. Ballyliffin has an 18-hole golf course.

The route then passes the Isle of Doagh (where there is a famine museum and an interpretive centre). Next is Carndonagh - the second largest town in Inishowen, after which the route turns North again through Malin Town, past Five Fingers Strand and then up onto cliff top viewpoint at Knockamany Bens, then down again to sea level with the route looking out into the Atlantic, before heading to Ireland&#x27;s most northerly point Malin Head.

On the North Eastern coast, the route passes through Culdaff village and Culdaff Bay (another Blue Flag beach), Tramone Bay, and Kinnagoe Bay. Further East, it reaches Lough Foyle and then Greencastle (a port used by fishing boats and a landing point for the car ferry from Magilligan in Northern Ireland). Then, as the road heads South along Lough Foyle, it passes through Moville town, Quigley&#x27;s Point and the village of Muff.

===Museums===

The famine village on the Isle of Doagh in Lagacurry takes visitors on a tour from the famine days of the 1840s to the present. It includes thatched cottages, a large walk-through museum, and guided tours of life in an isolated place living on the edge. 

Fort Dunree Military Museum is located at the site of the former coastal defence and fortification at Fort Dunree. During the Napoleonic Wars, the fort was built to defend Lough Swilly. The museum includes restored guns, a military camp and underground bunkers.

The Inishowen Maritime Museum &amp; Planetarium was founded in 1994 by maritime history enthusiasts who raised funds to buy the Old Coast Guard Station on Greencastle Harbor. The museum includes photographs and artefacts. A planetarium is housed in an extension built to the museum. There is a memorial to those lost at sea from the Inishowen Peninsula in front of the museum.

Local clubs include Beart CLG (in Burt), Buncrana GAA club, Carndonagh GAA club, Malin GAA club, Moville GAA club, Naomh Pádraig GAA club (Muff), and Urris GAA club.

===Association football===

<text>Finchley Central is a London Underground station in the Church End area of Finchley, north London. The station is located on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between West Finchley and East Finchley stations; it is the junction for the short branch to Mill Hill East. The station is around 7 miles north-northwest of Charing Cross and is in Travelcard Zone 4.

The station was opened on 22 August 1867 as part of the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations. As part of London Underground&#x27;s Northern Heights plan, Northern line trains started serving the station in 1940 and main line passenger services ended in 1941.

==History==

===Original station===

Finchley Central station was built by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) on its line from Finsbury Park to Edgware. As construction of the line was nearing completion and before it opened it was purchased in July 1867 by the larger Great Northern Railway (GNR), whose main line from King&#x27;s Cross ran through Finsbury Park on its way to Potters Bar and the north.

The station, originally named &quot;Finchley and Hendon&quot;, opened along with the railway to Edgware on 22 August 1867 in what was then rural Middlesex. It was north-northwest of Charing Cross as the crow flies, and from the GNR terminus at King&#x27;s Cross. A branch line from Finchley Central to High Barnet was constructed by the GNR and opened on 1 April 1872. After the Railways Act 1921 created the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies, the GNR became part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. The station was renamed by the GNR twice: to &quot;Finchley&quot; on 1 February 1872 and &quot;Finchley (Church End)&quot; on 1 February 1894. It was given its current name on 1 April 1940.

At the start of the 1930s the station had around 54 trains daily from High Barnet running to Finsbury Park and then either King&#x27;s Cross, Moorgate or Broad Street. Trains between Finchley Central and Edgware typically operated as a shuttle, although some trains ran through to the terminals.

In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) announced a proposal, which became known as the Northern Heights plan, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to the Northern line with new tunnels from the Northern line&#x27;s terminus at Archway to East Finchley and to the Northern City line with a new surface connection between Drayton Park and Finsbury Park. The line from Finchley Central to Edgware closed for electrification and reconstruction on 11 September 1939.

The station was first served by electric Northern line trains on 14 April 1940 when the service was extended from East Finchley to High Barnet. After a period where the station was serviced by both operators, LNER steam services were ended on 2 March 1941. Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, completion of the electrification works on the line to Edgware was slowed and was completed only as far as Mill Hill East. Northern line services to Mill Hill East began on 18 May 1941 to serve the nearby Inglis Barracks.

===Postwar===

After the war, the plans to complete the Northern Heights works were reviewed but were not restarted. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest demand for LPTB funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault.

A government-commissioned review of rail transport in the London area produced a report in 1946 that proposed many new lines. It anticipated that completion of the Northern Heights works would put pressure on the Northern line&#x27;s capacity and it proposed that a relief line should be considered for one or other of the two branches. One of these, designated Route 12B, was proposed to run as a tube line in tunnel from Finchley Central to Clapham Junction via Golders Green, St John&#x27;s Wood, Baker Street, Knightsbridge and Sloane Square.

Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights plan. The proposal for Route 12B was also not developed by the LPTB or its successor organisations.

Before the war, Charles Holden and Reginald Uren designed replacement station buildings to be built on both sides of the road bridge at the north end of the station. The curtailment of the Northern Heights Plan means that the rebuilding work was not implemented and the station still retains much of its original Victorian architectural character today. As one of two EH&amp;LR stations retaining its original buildings (the other is Mill Hill East), it is one of the oldest parts of the Underground system, pre-dating the first tunnelled section of the Northern line (the City &amp; South London Railway) by more than twenty years.

British Railways (the successor to the LNER) continued to operate goods trains from Finsbury Park to the station&#x27;s goods yard until 1 October 1962, when it was closed.
==The station today==

The station has two entrances. The main one, in the original station building, is on the north side of the tracks in Chaville Way, a short access road from the junction of Ballards Lane, Regents Park Road and Nether Street. The second entrance is to the south of the tracks in Station Road.

The station is in a cutting and the two entrances are joined by a footbridge over the tracks from which stairs and lifts connect to the platforms. The station is accessible for disabled passengers travelling in both directions.

The station has three platforms. Platforms 1 and 2, which share an island platform, are for northbound trains: platform 1 is used mainly by trains terminating at Finchley Central (and trains reverse using a reversing siding north of the station) or going to Mill Hill East; platform 2 is mainly used by trains going to High Barnet. Platform 3, a side platform, is for southbound trains. All platforms have canopies at their northern ends. The large station car park on the north side of the tracks, with access from Chaville Way, occupies the site of the former goods yard.

==Services and connections==
The station is in Travelcard Zone 4, between West Finchley and East Finchley on the Northern line. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–7 minutes between 05:44 and 01:05 northbound to High Barnet and 05:31 and 01:15 southbound to Kennington (via Charing Cross) or Morden (via Bank). Trains to Mill Hill East operate between 05:16 and 01:06 (except for peak hours and after 23.00 all trains operate as a shuttle between Finchley Central and Mill Hill East).

London Bus routes 13, 125, 143, 326, 382 and 460, night route N20, and school routes 626 and 683 serve the station.

==Cultural references==
The station features in the Finchley Central mind game, which in turn became the basis for the game Mornington Crescent in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

The New Vaudeville Band&#x27;s song &quot;Finchley Central&quot; reached No. 11 in the UK singles charts in 1967.

Harry Beck, designer of the original Tube map lived nearby and used the station in the 1930s. There is a commemorative plaque on Platform 3, together with a facsimile enamel panel of Beck&#x27;s iconic 1933 design.

<text>In combinatorial mathematics and probability theory, the Schrödinger method, named after the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, is used to solve some problems of distribution and occupancy.

Suppose

:formula_1

are independent random variables that are uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]. Let

:formula_2

be the corresponding order statistics, i.e., the result of sorting these &quot;n&quot; random variables into increasing order. We seek the probability of some event &quot;A&quot; defined in terms of these order statistics. For example, we might seek the probability that in a certain seven-day period there were at most two days in on which only one phone call was received, given that the number of phone calls during that time was 20. This assumes uniform distribution of arrival times.

The Schrödinger method begins by assigning a Poisson distribution with expected value &quot;λt&quot; to the number of observations in the interval [0, &quot;t&quot;], the number of observations in non-overlapping subintervals being independent (see Poisson process). The number &quot;N&quot; of observations is Poisson-distributed with expected value &quot;λ&quot;. Then we rely on the fact that the conditional probability

:formula_3

does not depend on &quot;λ&quot; (in the language of statisticians, &quot;N&quot; is a sufficient statistic for this parametrized family of probability distributions for the order statistics). We proceed as follows:

:formula_4

so that

:formula_5

Now the lack of dependence of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;N&quot; = &quot;n&quot;) upon &quot;λ&quot; entails that the last sum displayed above is a power series in &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;N&quot; = &quot;n&quot;) is the value of its &quot;n&quot;th derivative at &quot;λ&quot; = 0, i.e.,

:formula_6

For this method to be of any use in finding &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;N&quot; =&quot;n&quot;), must be possible to find &quot;P&quot;&quot;λ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) more directly than &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;N&quot; = &quot;n&quot;). What makes that possible is the independence of the numbers of arrivals in non-overlapping subintervals.</text><links>

<doc id="891151" wikidata="Q1341644" url="?curid=891151" title="Rich Little">
<text>Richard Caruthers Little (born November 26, 1938) is a Canadian-American comedian, impressionist and voice actor. Sometimes known as the &quot;Man of a Thousand Voices&quot;, Little has recorded nine comedy albums and made numerous television appearances, including three HBO specials.

==Early life==
Little was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the middle of three sons, older brother Fred and younger brother Chris. His father, Lawrence Peniston Little, was a surgeon who served as a lieutenant commander in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II and then worked for the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs until his death in 1959. His mother, Elizabeth (Betty) Maud (née Wilson), was a housewife who grew up in Sarnia, Ontario. 

A third-generation Canadian, he is descended from English stock on his father&#x27;s side and Irish on his mother&#x27;s. On his mother&#x27;s side, he is descended from John Willson, who was Speaker of the 5th Parliament of Upper Canada in the 1820s. His maternal grandfather was a judge. His paternal great-grandfather, William Carruthers Little, was a Liberal-Conservative Member of Parliament in the Canadian House of Commons from 1867 to 1881.

He attended Lisgar Collegiate Institute. In his early teens, he formed a partnership with Geoff Scott, another budding impressionist (and future elected politician), concentrating on reproducing the voices of Canadian politicians such as Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton.

==Career==
===Early career in Canada===
Starting when he was 11, Little acted in two documentary movies for Crawley Films of Ottawa.

Little was an usher at the Elgin Theatre in Ottawa, where he perfected his voices while standing at the back of the theatre. He started his amateur acting career at the Ottawa Little Theatre, winning his first acting award at the Eastern Ontario Drama Festival in Deep River, Ontario for his role as “Bo Decker” in the play &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. At 17, he and his friend and fellow impressionist Geoff Scott won a talent contest on station CBOT in Ottawa, the first time he was paid for his impressionist skills, which led to an appearance on &quot;Pick the Stars&quot;, a national talent contest broadcast by CBC Television in 1956, where the duo tied for first place. This, in turn, led to an appearance on &quot;The Jackie Rae Show&quot; during the 1956–57 season during which Little premiered his impression of Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton to a national audience.

Little and Scott&#x27;s comedy team performed at various local events and venues. Still in their teens, they developed a 10-minute act that they performed at Shriners&#x27; conventions and Knights of Columbus meetings. Scott later entered journalism, and ultimately politics.

Little began as a relief announcer on Ottawa radio station CFRA as a student during his summer vacations. He also performed comedy sketches with Les Lye on Lye&#x27;s morning show. In the early 1960s, he was hired as a disc jockey on CJET in Smiths Falls, Ontario. His afternoon-evening shift ran from 4 to 8 pm weekdays, and the show gave him the opportunity to use his impressions on the air. In 1961, for 26 weeks, he co-hosted &quot;Folderol&quot; a half-hour suppertime show of light humour and interviews on television station CBOT.

By the 1960s, Little was taking his act to Toronto, where he performed at coffee houses, nightclubs, and other venues.

In 1963, Little issued two LPs through the Canadian division of Capitol Records. The first was &quot;My Fellow Canadians&quot; with Les Lye. The album was inspired by Vaughn Meader&#x27;s hit American satirical album &quot;The First Family&quot; and concentrated on Canadian political satire, featuring Little impersonating figures well-known to a Canadian audience such as Diefenbaker, Lester Pearson and Tommy Douglas. His second album was &quot;Scrooge and the Stars&quot;, which featured Little acting out Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; entirely on his own, playing all the roles as 22 different Hollywood stars, ranging from Jack Benny to Jack Webb. The album was released in early November, but it was withdrawn a few weeks later due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as Little had imitated JFK in the role of the Spirit of Christmas Present and had Kennedy say the line &quot;Scrooge, my life upon the globe is brief; it ends tonight. In fact, it ends as fast as you can say your name.&quot;

===Breaking into the US===
Little&#x27;s first performance in the US was in December 1963 at Guy Lombardo&#x27;s inn and country club in Tierra Verde, Florida.

Little&#x27;s American career was helped by Peppiatt and Aylesworth, a Canadian writing team who had moved to Hollywood and worked on various specials and variety series, including &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;. Familiar with Little&#x27;s work in Canada, Peppiatt had worked on &quot;The Jackie Rae Show&quot; on which Little made a television appearance at 17, and the team had written Little&#x27;s original Canadian nightclub act and would write much of his American material in the 1960s. They played a recording of Little for Garland, and the show&#x27;s musical director, Mel Tormé, and they encouraged her to audition him. Tormé had met Little when they both performed in a CBC Television variety show in Toronto, and bonded over their love of old movies.

The audition won him the job, and in January 1964, Little made his American television debut on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;, where he impressed Garland by imitating various male celebrities, including James Mason, who had been Garland&#x27;s co-star in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. Television appearances on variety shows hosted by Ed Sullivan, Jackie Gleason, Rudy Vallee, Mike Douglas, George Burns, and Al Hirt followed over the next two years.

Peppiatt and Aylesworth also helped bring Little on to other American shows for which they wrote, such as &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;, &quot;The Kopykats&quot;, and &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot; and continued to write material for his act after he moved to the US permanently at the end of 1965.

In Canada, Little starred in his own show &quot;The Rich Little Show&quot;, on CBC Radio in 1966. He also made his first appearances on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot; during the 1965–1966 season.

In 1965, Little provided the voice for the Pink Panther in two cartoons, &quot;Sink Pink&quot; and &quot;Pink Ice&quot;; these two cartoons were made by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises to experiment with giving the Panther dialogue, contrary to him usually being mute.

In 1966 and 1967, Little appeared in ABC-TV&#x27;s Judy Carne sitcom &quot;Love on a Rooftop&quot; as the Willises&#x27; eccentric neighbour, Stan Parker. He appeared on &quot;That Girl&quot; in 1967 as a writer who impressed Marlo Thomas&#x27; character with his impersonations. He also made two memorable appearances as accident-prone Brother Paul Leonardi on &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; in 1968; it marked one of his few appearances as a character actor rather than an impressionist. In 1969, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; as newly engaged fiancé to Billie Jo in &quot;Billie Jo and the Big Big Star&quot;.
===Nixon===
Little became best known for his impression of U.S. President Richard Nixon. During the 1970s, Little made many television appearances portraying Nixon, and once performed his impersonation in front of Nixon himself, who Little says did not realize he was imitating him at all and &quot;wondered why I was talking to him in such a funny voice.&quot; In 1972, he portrayed Richard Nixon with the voice and mannerisms of Oliver Hardy in &quot;Another Nice Mess&quot;. Little later appeared as Nixon on the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, in a 1991 fantasy sequence regarding Gina&#x27;s ideal sperm donor.

Little was part of an April Fool&#x27;s Day prank in 1992 when he appeared on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; as Nixon announcing his candidacy for president in the 1992 United States presidential election using the slogan &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, and I won&#x27;t do it again.&quot; Listeners flooded NPR with calls expressing outrage at the announcement, which NPR did not reveal as a hoax until the second half of the program.

In 2020, Little developed &quot;Trial on the Potomac: The Impeachment of Richard Nixon&quot;, a one-man show based on the 2015 book &quot;The Real Watergate Scandal: Collusion, Conspiracy, and the Plot That Brought Nixon Down&quot; by Geoff Shepard, alleging a conspiracy to remove Nixon from office.

===1970s===
Little was a semiregular on the Emmy-winning ABC-TV variety series &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot; in 1972–73. In response to his imitation of Jack Benny, the comedian sent Little an 18-carat gold money clip containing this message: &quot;With Bob Hope doing my walk and you doing my voice, I can be a star and do nothing.&quot; 

Little&#x27;s best-known continuing TV series was &quot;The Kopycats&quot;, hour-long segments of &quot;The ABC Comedy Hour&quot;, broadcast in 1972. Taped in England, these comedy-variety shows consisted entirely of celebrity impersonations, with the actors in full costume and makeup for every sketch. The cast included Little, Frank Gorshin, Marilyn Michaels, George Kirby, British comedian Joe Baker, Fred Travalena, Charlie Callas, and Peter Goodwright.

Little was a regular guest on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts&quot; in the 1970s, appearing in 24 of the specials, where he roasted celebrities such as Don Rickles, Jack Benny, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart and Kirk Douglas.

&quot;The Rich Little Show&quot; (1976) on NBC and &quot;The New You Asked for It&quot; (1981) were attempts to present Little in his own persona, away from his gallery of characterizations. Little also appeared on a second-season episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

The one-man show &quot;Rich Little&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; was his first HBO special, produced by and originally aired on CBC Television in December 1978 and airing on HBO in 1979. Little portrayed famous comedians in established roles (W. C. Fields as Ebenezer Scrooge, Paul Lynde as Bob Cratchit, et al.). The special won an International Emmy Award and a Rose d&#x27;Or award.

===1980s===
In 1981, Little appeared in a comedy LP called &quot;The First Family Rides Again&quot;, which was the fourth and final of the &quot;First Family&quot; comedy LPs originally created by Bob Booker, David Arvedon, and Earle Doud. Little starred along with Melanie Chartoff, Michael Richards, Shelley Hack, Jenilee Harrison, Earle Doud, and Vaughn Meader, making light of U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s first few months in the White House.

Another HBO special followed in 1983 with &quot;Rich Little&#x27;s Robin Hood&quot;, including portrayals of Groucho Marx as Robin Hood, Humphrey Bogart as Prince John, John Wayne as Little John, Carol Channing as Maid Marion, Laurel and Hardy as Sheriffs of Nottingham, George Burns as Alan-a-Dale, and various other characters.

Outside of any comedic context, Little&#x27;s talent for impersonation has been used in movies when an actor&#x27;s dialogue was impaired by poor health. When David Niven proved too ill for his voice to be used in his appearances in &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; (1982) and &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983), Little provided the overdub as an imitation of Niven&#x27;s voice. He performed similar duties to dub an imitation of James Cagney&#x27;s stroke-impaired voice in the 1984 TV movie &quot;Terrible Joe Moran&quot; and in the 1991 TV special &quot;Christmas at the Movies&quot; by providing an uncredited dub for actor/dancer Gene Kelly, who had lost his voice.

He also lent his voice to the narration of three specials that were the forerunners for the animated series &quot;The Raccoons&quot;: &quot;The Christmas Raccoons&quot; (1980), &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Raccoons and the Lost Star&quot; (1983). His brother, Fred Little, voiced the character Cedric Sneer.

In 1987, during the &quot;We the People 200: The Constitutional Gala&quot; television special, Little personified various historical figures, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Edward R. Murrow, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy. Little&#x27;s performance was described as eclectic, impersonating Henry Fonda as Abraham Lincoln and doing Winston Churchill giving a rousing speech.

===&quot;The Tonight Show&quot;===
Little was a frequent guest on variety and talk shows in the 1960s and 1970s, and had an unofficial monthly slot on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; for several years, and also guest hosted the program about a dozen times. He developed an impression of Johnny Carson, capturing &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; host&#x27;s voice and many onstage mannerisms, and later played Carson in the HBO TV movie &quot;The Late Shift&quot;. Little&#x27;s appearances on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; ended without notice after his August 1982 appearance. Little claims in his biography that he was banned because Carson was offended by his impression, and this claim was supported by Henry Bushkin, Carson&#x27;s long-time lawyer, who stated that nobody got under Carson&#x27;s skin more than Little. Little had been doing the impression since the early 1970s, though, a decade prior to his bookings on the show coming to an end, including performing the impression to the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host&#x27;s face when Carson was the guest of honor at &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast of Johnny Carson&quot; in 1973. In response to Little&#x27;s claims, Fred DeCordova, Carson&#x27;s producer, said they just were not interested in hiring him any more due to his lack of new impressions.

===Las Vegas and later career===
Little has been appearing in Las Vegas since the mid-1960s, when he had dates at the Golden Nugget and went on to play at other Vegas venues such as The Sands, where he debuted in 1969 with a two-year contract. In 1973, he performed at Caesars Palace for four weeks as the opening act for The Osmonds. He then appeared at the Desert Inn with Juliet Prowse for a month in 1974. His appearances continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s; he headlined at the Desert Inn for eight years in the late 1970s and 1980s, at the MGM Grand with Nell Carter in 1985; at Bally&#x27;s, with Charo in 1986; the Sands in 1991 and 1992, and at the Golden Nugget again in 1991.

With opportunities for him to work in television and film in decline, and his television work almost completely drying up by the mid-1980s, the focus of Little&#x27;s career shifted from Hollywood to Las Vegas. The decline in his career was blamed in part on him not having updated his repertory of impressions with younger voices, a fact he blames on recent generations of actors using a naturalistic delivery that makes their voices less distinctive. &quot;It&#x27;s much easier to do Humphrey Bogart than Tom Cruise,&quot; he said. &quot;How do you imitate Brad Pitt? George Clooney? Wouldn&#x27;t mean anything.&quot;

Little sold his house in Los Angeles and relocated to Las Vegas in 1990, and bought a home in 1992, when he signed an exclusive, long-term contract with the Sahara, staging a revamped version of &quot;The Kopykats&quot; with other impersonators. He later moved to Paris Las Vegas, where he starred in &quot;The Presidents&quot;, a play on nine Presidents of the United States from Kennedy to George W. Bush, starting in 2002. In 2004, he moved to the Suncoast.

In the early 2010s, he performed a one-man show, &quot;Jimmy Stewart and Friends&quot;, based on the life of Jimmy Stewart, at the Westgate hotel, and on tour. After the death of his friend Jimmy Stewart in the late 1990s, Rich recorded the crosswalk messages for intersections in Stewart&#x27;s hometown of Indiana, Pennsylvania, using his imitation of the star&#x27;s voice.

From 2015 until 2024, Little was a regular performer at the Laugh Factory in the Tropicana hotel in Las Vegas. His one-hour show, &quot;Rich Little Live!&quot;, was a career retrospective including video highlights from his TV career, and was performed five nights a week. Throughout the show, he displayed many of the charcoal sketches he has drawn of the celebrities he has impersonated. The Tropicana closed in April 2024 and was subsequently demolished to make way for a new stadium for the Athletics baseball team for when it moves to Las Vegas from Oakland in 2028. Little has said he intends to move to the relocated Laugh Factory once a new site on the Las Vegas Strip is found for the club.

Little was the host for the 2007 White House Correspondents&#x27; Association dinner. Although President George W. Bush was reported to have enjoyed Little&#x27;s performance, it was panned by some reviewers for &quot;his ancient jokes and impressions of dead people (Johnny Carson, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan).&quot;

Little appeared as a guest star in &quot;Futurama&quot; season two episode &quot;Raging Bender&quot; and the film &quot;&quot;, playing his own celebrity head, impersonating Howard Cosell.

In 2017, Little released his memoir, &quot;Little by Little: People I Have Known and Been&quot;. In 2021, &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; profiled Little; during the interview, he stated he believed it was the first time he had been on network television in 30 years, and hoped it would &quot;go over well!&quot;

In 2018, he appeared as himself in the documentary &quot;They&#x27;ll Love Me When I&#x27;m Dead&quot; about Orson Welles&#x27; final film &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;. Little was in the original 1974 cast but left for other commitments and his scenes were reshot with Peter Bogdanovich playing the part. Bogdanovich completed directing the film in 2018 after Welles died in 1985. Little is credited as a party guest in &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;.

Little was a frequent guest on &quot;Huckabee&quot;, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee&#x27;s talk show on the Trinity Broadcast Network, having appeared more frequently than any other guest. His last appearance was on the series finale, January 11, 2025.

===Honours===
Little was named &quot;Comedy Star of the Year&quot; by the American Guild of Variety Artists in 1974.

He was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983.

In 1998, Little was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, and into the Casino Legends Hall of Fame in 1999. He was given a star on the Las Vegas Walk of Stars in 2005.

In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.
He was inducted into the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame in 2001.

Little was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2022, with the rank of Officer.

==Other interests==
Little has been active in several charities, including the Juvenile Diabetes Fund and the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network. He has been named to Miami Children&#x27;s Hospital International Pediatrics Hall of Fame and been honoured by the naming of the Rich Little Special Care Nursery at Ottawa Civic Hospital. He has been a major supporter in helping veterans through the Gary Sinise Foundation.

==Personal life==
Little was engaged to Canadian actress Jean Christopher in 1965, but they did not end up marrying.

Little was married to Jeanne Worden, whom he met when she was working as a secretary on &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, in 1971. The couple had a daughter together, Bria, before their divorce in 1989. Little had a brief relationship with Lalette Cottrell, of Delaware; the couple had a daughter together, Lyndsay (born 1988).

Little was engaged to magician Melinda Saxe, but she broke-off the three-year relationship in 1991, saying she had discovered he had secretly videotaped them having sex in 1988. Saxe sued Little for defamation, invasion of privacy, and inflicting emotional distress, claiming he had joked about their relationship on stage. Little claimed the videotaping was consensual. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.

He married comedian and impressionist Jeannette Markey in 1994; they divorced in 1997. He was married to Marie Marotta from 2003 until her death in 2010 of a deliberate overdose of sleeping pills after years of suffering from migraines and chronic pain. He married his fourth wife, Catherine Brown, a former reality show contestant, in a private ceremony in 2012; they divorced in October of that year.

In 2010, Little became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Politically, he is a conservative and has described himself as &quot;basically a Republican&quot;, though his act has generally been non-partisan. In 2021, he asserted to the &quot;Daily Beast&quot; his belief that Donald Trump won the 2020 United States presidential election.

Little&#x27;s older brother, Fred, was a social worker and voice actor who was the original voice of Cederic Sneer in &quot;The Raccoons&quot;. Fred Little also performed in smaller venues as an impressionist in his own right and appeared on the &quot;Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; on January 25, 1979 and an episode of &quot;An Evening at the Improv&quot; in 1990, both times with Rich Little hosting. Younger brother Chris was a commercial artist who designed the covers of Little&#x27;s albums.

<text>Clarence Ellsworth Miller, Jr. (November 1, 1917 – August 2, 2011) was a Republican Congressman from Ohio, serving January 3, 1967 to January 3, 1993.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Lancaster, Ohio, one of six children of an electrician father. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in correspondence school and became a certified electrical engineer. He worked for Columbia Gas and held patents related to the pumping of gas.

== Congress ==
Miller was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1966 to represent a section of southeastern Ohio where, in Lancaster, he had served as mayor. During the Persian Gulf War, he was reportedly the only member of Congress who had a grandson (Drew Miller, of Lancaster, Ohio) fighting in that conflict.

By training, he was an engineer, and &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; wrote that Mr. Miller approached politics with the &quot;precise and orderly manner&quot; that one might expect from someone of his profession.

==U.S. patents==
, Filed August 1, 1960, Patented May 7, 1963 &quot;Remote Control and Alarm System For A Compressor Station and Compressor Engines Thereof&quot;

, Filed July 26, 1960, Patented October 5, 1965 &quot;Magneto Having Auxiliary Pole Piece&quot;

==Elections==
In 1966, the Tenth Congressional District elected Miller to the Ninetieth Congress, defeating incumbent Democrat Walter H. Moeller, and he was re-elected to twelve succeeding Congresses.

Miller was a 13-term Ohio Republican nicknamed &quot;Five Percent Clarence&quot; for his persistent efforts to cut spending bills by that amount. He did not cultivate publicity, preferring instead to focus on legislation more than on the Washington talk-show circuit. He was known for his near-perfect attendance on votes no matter how minute. In 1990, the Capitol Hill publication Roll Call named Mr. Miller the &quot;most obscure&quot; member of Congress. It was intended as a compliment, considering that grandstanders never would have received such an honor. A fiscal conservative, he served on the House Appropriations Committee. The numerous bills he introduced, often unsuccessfully, aimed to cut spending measures—if not by the 5 percent figure in his nickname, then at least by 2 percent. In 1977, he succeeded in persuading House colleagues to cut foreign aid by 5 percent.

He lost his bid for reelection in the 1992 primary after redistricting.

==Elections by landslide==

Twelve of the thirteen elections won by Mr. Miller were by a margin of victory of greater than 25%.

==Heated 1992 primary==
Ohio lost two seats in the 1990 reapportionment. The Democrats and Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly struck a deal to eliminate one Democratic and one Republican district, as one congressman from each party was expected to retire. The Republican expected to retire was Miller, but he announced he would run again. The Democrats in the Statehouse would not reconsider the deal and so Miller&#x27;s Tenth District was obliterated. (The new Tenth was in Cuyahoga County.)

The new district map was not agreed upon by the General Assembly until March 26, 1992, one week before the filing deadline for the primary originally scheduled for May 5. (Governor George Voinovich signed the new map into law on March 27, and on April 1 the General Assembly moved the primary to June 2.) Miller&#x27;s own hometown was placed in freshman David Hobson&#x27;s Seventh District, but Miller chose to run in the Sixth District against Bob McEwen; only one of the twelve counties in Miller&#x27;s old Tenth District was in the new Seventh but the largest piece of his old district, five counties, was placed in the new Sixth. Miller also had a strong distaste for McEwen, a Hillsboro Republican in his sixth term who had been elected to Congress at age thirty.

Despite being hurt in a fall in his bathtub after slipping on a bar of soap, an injury that led Republicans to expect his withdrawal, Miller stayed in the race. A deal was hoped for as late as May 15, the day Miller was scheduled to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal, but Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced each other in the Republican primary on June 2, 1992.

McEwen, who Congressional Quarterly&#x27;s &quot;Politics in America&quot; pronounced &quot;invincible&quot;, was caught up in the House banking scandal, which had been seized upon by Newt Gingrich, a like-minded conservative House Republican, as an example of the corruption of Congress. Martin Gottlieb of the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; said &quot;McEwen was collateral damage&quot; to Gingrich&#x27;s crusade. McEwen initially denied bouncing any checks. Later, he admitted he had bounced a few. Then when the full totals were released by Ethics Committee investigators, the number was revealed to have been 166 over thirty-nine months. McEwen said that he always had funds available to cover the alleged overdrafts, pointing to the policy of the House sergeant at arms, who ran the House bank, paying checks on an overdrawn account if it would not exceed the sum of the Representative&#x27;s next paycheck. In 1991, McEwen had also been criticized for his use of the franking privilege and his frequent trips overseas at taxpayer expense, but McEwen defended the trips as part of his work on the Intelligence Committee and in building relationships with legislatures overseas.

The primary race was bitter. Miller called McEwen &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and McEwen said of Miller &quot;his misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I tried to be his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply disappointed at the meanness of his effort.&quot; Tom Deimer of Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: &quot;both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts.&quot; Miller noted he had no overdrafts, saying, &quot;the score is 166 to nothing&quot; referring to the number of checks McEwen bounced in the House banking scandal.

The 1992 primary was so close it forced a recount and a lawsuit. When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller&#x27;s charges of voting irregularities in Highland, Hocking, and Warren Counties, Miller filed suit in the Ohio Supreme Court. Only in August did Miller drop his court challenge and then only because his campaign was out of money. In the final count, McEwen won 33,219 votes to Miller&#x27;s 32,922, a plurality of only 297 votes. Ominously for November, each had won the counties they had formerly represented, McEwen making little headway in the new eastern counties in the district. After the final result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen and carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should be drawn on a politically neutral basis. After the primary, McEwen introduced H. R. 5727 in the House to name the locks on the Ohio near Gallipolis after Miller, but the bill did not pass. McEwen subsequently lost the general election that year to Ted Strickland.

==Family==
His wife of 51 years, the former Helen Brown, died in 1987. The couple had two children, Ronald K. Miller of Lancaster and Jacqueline M. Williams of Cincinnati; five grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.

==Death==
After his election loss Clarence Miller returned to Lancaster. He was honored on his birthday, November 20, 2010, by the Hocking Valley Chapter of the Ohio Society of The Sons of the American Revolution, for his patriotism. He resided in Lancaster until his death on August 2, 2011, aged 93.

<text>An information subsidy is the provision of ready-to-use newsworthy information to the news media by various sources interested in gaining access to media time and space. Typical forms of information subsidies include press releases, as well as press seminars and conferences.

This information represents a subsidy to the media, since it lowers the cost of news-gathering. Out of the various alternatives available to the media to collect information —investigative work, informal channels and routine sources—, the latter channel is the cheapest to monitor and maintain. Relying on information provided by external sources can thus relieve the economic burden and shorten the time to publication, especially when the information is presented in a format (such as an inverted pyramid) and style that can be easily incorporated in news.

On the other hand, critics argue that subsidies have the potential to skew the process of news selection by leading journalists to pick stories based on criteria other than their inherent importance and newsworthiness. The content of the coverage, critics contend, is also likely to be influenced, since the subsidised materials are usually biased in favour of the source organisation. From the source&#x27;s point of view, the ideal goal is to have the news media view reflect as closely as possible their own.

<text>Condé Nast () is a global mass media company founded in 1909 by Condé Montrose Nast (1873–1942) and owned by Advance Publications. Its headquarters are located at One World Trade Center in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan.

The company&#x27;s media brands attract more than 72 million consumers in print, 394 million in digital and 454 million across social media platforms. These include &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair, Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;Bon Appétit&quot;, and &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, among many others. U.S. &quot;Vogue&quot; editor-in-chief Anna Wintour serves as Artistic Director and Global Chief Content Officer. In 2011, the company launched the Condé Nast Entertainment division, tasked with developing film, television, social and digital video, and virtual reality content.

==History==
The company traces its roots to 1909, when Condé Montrose Nast, a New York City-born publisher, purchased &quot;Vogue&quot;, a printed magazine launched in 1892 as a New York weekly journal of society and fashion news.

Nast initially published the magazine under the corporate name Vogue Company. In 1922, he incorporated Condé Nast Publications as the holding company for his interests. Nast had a flair for nurturing elite readers as well as advertisers and upgraded &quot;Vogue&quot;, sending the magazine on its path of becoming a top haute couture fashion authority. Eventually, Nast&#x27;s portfolio expanded to include &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (briefly known as &quot;Dress and Vanity Fair&quot;), &quot;Glamour&quot;, and &quot;American Golfer&quot;, published from 1908 to 1920. The company also introduced British &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1916, and Condé Nast became the first publisher of an overseas edition of an existing magazine.

Condé Nast is largely considered to be the originator of the &quot;class publication&quot;, a type of magazine focused on a particular social group or interest instead of targeting the largest possible readership. Its magazines focus on a wide range of subjects, including travel, food, home, and culture, with fashion the larger portion of the company&#x27;s focus. This company also opened a printing facility in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1924 but closed in 1964 to make way for more centrally located sites capable of producing higher volumes. During the Great Depression, Condé Nast introduced innovative typography, design, and color. &quot;Vogue&#x27;s&quot; first full color photograph by Edward Steichen was featured on the cover in 1932, marking the year when Condé Nast began replacing fashion drawings on covers with photo illustrations―an innovative move at the time. &quot;Glamour&quot;, launched in 1939, was the last magazine personally introduced to the company by Nast, who died in 1942. The Nast family connection to the publishing business remained, with Nast&#x27;s son Charles Coudert Nast serving as the company&#x27;s longtime general counsel.

In 1959, Samuel I. Newhouse bought Condé Nast for US$5 million as an anniversary gift for his wife Mitzi, who loved &quot;Vogue&quot;. He merged it with the privately held holding company Advance Publications. His son, S. I. Newhouse, Jr., known as &quot;Si&quot;, became chairman of Condé Nast in 1975. Under Newhouse, Condé Nast acquired &quot;Brides&quot; in 1959, revived &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1983 after it was shuttered in 1936, and launched the new publication &quot;Self&quot; in 1979.

===2000–2009===
At the outset of the new millennium in January 2000, Condé Nast moved from 350 Madison Avenue to 4 Times Square. The move was viewed as a significant catalyst for the redevelopment of Times Square. In the same year, Condé Nast purchased Fairchild Publications (now known as Fairchild Fashion Media), home to &quot;W&quot; and &quot;WWD&quot;, from the Walt Disney Company. In 2001, Condé Nast bought &quot;Golf Digest&quot; and &quot;Golf World&quot; from The New York Times Company for US$435 million. On October 31, 2006, Condé Nast acquired the content aggregation site Reddit, later on spun off as a wholly owned subsidiary of Condé Nast&#x27;s parent company in September 2011. The company folded the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Jane&quot; with its August issue in 2007, and later shut down its website. One of Condé Nast&#x27;s oldest titles, the American edition of &quot;House and Garden&quot;, ceased publication after the December 2007 issue. &quot;Portfolio&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; and &quot;Domino&quot; were folded as well. On May 20, 2008, the company announced its acquisition of a popular technology-oriented website, &quot;Ars Technica&quot;.

On October 5, 2009, Condé Nast announced the closure of three of its publications: &quot;Cookie&quot;, &quot;Modern Bride&quot;, and &quot;Elegant Bride&quot;. &quot;Gourmet&quot; ceased monthly publication with its November 2009 issue; the Gourmet brand was later resurrected as &quot;Gourmet Live&quot;, an iPad app that delivers new editorial content in the form of recipes, interviews, stories, and videos. In print, &quot;Gourmet&quot; continues in the form of special editions on newsstands and cookbooks. That same year, Condé Nast announced the launch of &quot;Love&quot; magazine, a bi-annual British style magazine founded by fashion journalist Katie Grand. In 2020, Grand announced her departure and was replaced by Whembley Sewell.

===2010–present===
In July 2010, Robert Sauerberg became Condé Nast&#x27;s president. In May 2011, the company was the first major publisher to deliver subscriptions for the iPad, starting with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; the company has since rolled out iPad subscriptions for nine of its titles. In the same month, Next Issue Media, a joint venture formed by five U.S. publishers including Condé Nast, announced subscriptions for Android devices, initially available for the Samsung Galaxy Tab.

In September 2011, Condé Nast said it would offer 17 of its brands to the Kindle Fire. The company launched Conde Nast Entertainment in 2011 to develop movies, television series, and digital video programming. In May 2013, CNÉ&#x27;s Digital Video Network debuted, featuring web series for such publications as &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; joined the Digital Video Network with the announcement of five original web series including the National Security Agency satire &quot;Codefellas&quot; and the animated advice series &quot;Mister Know-It-All&quot;.

In October 2013, the company ended its internship program after being sued by two former interns claiming they had been paid less than minimum wage for summer internships there. In November 2014, the company moved into One World Trade Center in Manhattan, where its headquarters are now located. On September 14, 2015, the company announced Sauerberg as its new CEO, with former CEO Charles H. Townsend taking the role of Chairman, and S. I. Newhouse Jr. taking the role of Chairman Emeritus in January 2016. On October 13, 2015, Condé Nast announced that it had acquired &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.

In July 2016, the company announced the launch of Condé Nast Spire, a new division of the company focusing on consumer purchasing data and content consumption through the company&#x27;s own first-party behavioral data. The Chairman of the company, Charles Townsend, retired at the end of 2016, and the Chairman Emeritus Newhouse died the following October.

In March 2018, Condé Nast announced the launch of the influencer-based platform &quot;Next Gen&quot;. The company&#x27;s Chief Revenue and Marketing Officer, Pamela Drucker Mann, stated that the platform would feature both &quot;in-house and external talent with significant and meaningful social followings&quot;. In April 2019, Condé Nast appointed the former CEO of Pandora Media, Roger Lynch, as the company&#x27;s first global CEO. It also sold the magazine &quot;Brides&quot; to the digital media company Dotdash, and in May of the same year, announced the sale of &quot;Golf Digest&quot; to Discovery, Inc. In June of the same year, Condé Nast sold &quot;W&quot; to a new holding company, Future Media Group. &quot;W&quot; editor Stefano Tonchi later sued the company for wrongful termination, with Condé Nast suing Tonchi in response, seeking the return of &quot;all monies paid to [Tonchi] during his period of disloyalty&quot;, claiming that he had acted as a &quot;faithless servant&quot; during the sale of &quot;W&quot;, and had interfered with the sale to benefit himself.

Roger Lynch was appointed chief executive officer in April 2019, and in October 2019, announced plans to increase Condé Nast&#x27;s revenue from readers.

In June 2020, following the global outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19, it was reported that Condé Nast had experienced a drop in advertising revenues of 45% as a result of the pandemic. It was also reported that the company had, in previous years, sublet six of the company&#x27;s 23 floors in the One World Trade Center, following the cancellation of a number of its publishing titles.

In November 2023, the company announced it would be cutting about 5 percent of its workforce which would impact approximately 270 employees. Some of the reasons given for this are pressures from digital advertising, decreasing social media traffic, and shifting audience preferences towards short-form video content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

In January 2024, union members from the company&#x27;s publications set a strike for 24 hours aligned with the announcement of 96th Academy Awards nominees claiming that the company was &quot;engaging in regressive bargaining and breaking the law in bargaining by rescinding an offer that they had previously made around layoffs&quot;. Anne Hathaway walked out of a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; photo shoot the same day, January 23, in solidarity with the union.

In December 2024, Condé Nast announced additional layoffs specifically targeting top executives at the company.

<text>William Francis Carrigan (October 22, 1883 – July 8, 1969), nicknamed &quot;Rough&quot;, was an American Major League baseball catcher and manager. He played for the Boston Red Sox between 1906 and 1916, and he was a player-manager for the last four of those seasons. In 1915 and 1916, Carrigan&#x27;s teams won back-to-back World Series. He was said to exert a positive influence on young Red Sox star Babe Ruth, serving as his roommate and his manager. He has the highest postseason winning percentage (.800) of any manager with multiple postseason appearances, and was named to the Honor Rolls of Baseball in 1946.

After his playing career, Carrigan was a partner in a large chain of New England vaudeville and movie theaters. He returned to the Red Sox as a manager between 1927 and 1929; the team finished in last place in each of those seasons. He then returned to his native Lewiston, where he was named a bank president in 1953 and where he died in 1969.

==Early life==
Carrigan was born in Lewiston, Maine. Carrigan&#x27;s brother John was a talented pitcher, and Carrigan served as his catcher. Carrigan played football and baseball at Lewiston High School; he also played roller polo, but it caused him to get into fights, and his brother pleaded with him to stop playing. He studied at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. At the time, Holy Cross was known for sending its baseball players to the major leagues.

==Early baseball career==

Carrigan started his career as a platoon catcher and played all ten seasons with the Boston Red Sox. Biographer Richard A. Johnson noted that Carrigan was known in baseball for combining toughness with intelligence. For a portion of his time in Boston, Carrigan&#x27;s roommate was Babe Ruth. &quot;Carrigan served Ruth as a combination father confessor, drill sergeant, psychologist and Dutch uncle,&quot; wrote Johnson. Ruth called Carrigan the best manager he ever played for. Carrigan also had a close relationship with Detroit Tigers star Ty Cobb. Both Carrigan and Cobb were known for their intense play on the field, but they were friends and Cobb often came to Maine to visit Carrigan.

A schism was forming along religious lines among Red Sox players and coaches in the early 1910s. Players like Tris Speaker held anti-Catholic sentiments, and they supported their manager, Stahl. Carrigan was among a group of Catholics on the team who were more aligned with team co-owner Jimmy McAleer. Midway through the 1913 season, McAleer fired Stahl and made Carrigan a player-manager. Author Thomas Whalen writes that Speaker and Carrigan once had a fistfight, and Carrigan won the fight, helping him to establish a sense of authority.

The Red Sox finished in second place in 1914. In July of that year, they paid $25,000 to Baltimore of the International League for Babe Ruth, Ernie Shore and Ben Egan. Ruth gave up 21 hits in 23 innings pitched for the Red Sox that year.
Carrigan received a dispensation from the Catholic Church to marry a Protestant woman, Beulah Bartlett, before the 1915 baseball season. They had been friends since childhood. Carrigan led the team to world championships in 1915 and 1916, compiling an 8–2 record as a manager in World Series play. Until Terry Francona duplicated the feat in 2007, he was the only manager to have won two World Series titles with Boston.

In August 1916, Carrigan approached Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin about the possibility of retiring soon. His father-in-law&#x27;s death had left some family business outstanding. The next month he decided that he would step down at the end of the season, wanting to decrease the time he spent traveling. He was also looking to devote more attention to a movie theater partnership known as the Maine and New Hampshire Theater Corporation. Lannin had hoped that Carrigan would change his mind, but other things were on Carrigan&#x27;s mind. He and his wife had a child, also named Beulah, in November, and they later had another daughter, Constance, and a son, William Jr.

==Hiatus from baseball==
With Carrigan having turned down Lannin&#x27;s pleas to remain manager of the Red Sox, and with Lannin having sold the team, new owner Harry Frazee named Jack Barry as Carrigan&#x27;s successor in January 1917. Carrigan pursued his theater venture. The group owned as many as fifty theaters and there were three other partners in the corporation: a Lewiston man named William P. Gray; a former Mayor of Portsmouth, Albert Hyslop; and former New Hampshire Governor John H. Bartlett. In January 1922, Carrigan sold his interests in the corporation to Gray; the &quot;Washington Times&quot; said that Carrigan was thought to have received between $200,000 and $250,000.

==Return to the Red Sox==
In the years after Carrigan&#x27;s unexpected departure from the Red Sox, he was often the subject of rumors about a return to baseball. In the article announcing the sale of his theater shares, the &quot;Washington Times&quot; even speculated that he might be preparing to buy the Red Sox from Frazee. Carrigan did return to the Red Sox, but it was as a manager and not until 1927. He was unable to duplicate his previous success, as Boston finished in last place for three straight seasons.

By early December 1929, Carrigan said he was uncertain whether he would accept President Bob Quinn&#x27;s offer to return as Red Sox manager. Despite the team&#x27;s struggles, James O&#x27;Leary of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that &quot;Pres Quinn and every baseball fan in New England and throughout the entire American League circuit would like to see the veteran back on the job next season.&quot; Carrigan resigned on December 20. 
==Managerial record==
==Later life==
In 1933 and 1934, Carrigan was the head baseball coach at Bates College. In 1953, he was named president of People&#x27;s Savings Bank in Lewiston. In 1958, Carrigan&#x27;s wife died. Carrigan died at Central Maine General Hospital in Lewiston at the age of 85. He was posthumously elected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004.

<text>Ekaterini Thanou (, ; born 1 February 1975), also known as Katerina Thanou, is a Greek former sprinter. She won numerous medals in the 100 metres, including an Olympic silver medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, while she was the 2002 European champion in Munich, Germany. She had also been crowned world and European champion in the 60 metres at the indoor championships.

In 2007, Marion Jones, who won in the 100 metres at the 2000 Olympics leaving Thanou in the second place, admitted that she had used steroids and her gold medal was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee, but was not reallocated to Thanou because she was also involved in doping.

She was named the Greek Female Athlete of the Year, for the years 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2002.

== Suspension ==
For the 2004 Summer Olympics, Thanou was one of the main hopes of the home crowd for winning an athletics medal. However, on the day prior to the opening ceremony, Thanou and her training partner Konstantinos Kenteris failed to attend a drugs test, and later the same night were hospitalised, claiming they had both been injured in a motorcycle accident. In the ensuing doping scandal, Kenteris and Thanou announced their withdrawal from the Games on 18 August after a hearing before the Disciplinary Commission of the IOC, for what they described to be &quot;in the interests of the country.&quot; An official Greek investigation into their alleged accident ruled that it had been staged and the pair were criminally charged with making false statements to authorities.

The missed test in Athens was the duo&#x27;s third violation of the summer and they were consequently provisionally suspended by the IAAF on 22 December 2004. In June 2005, however, the athletes were cleared of all charges by the Greek athletics federation. Their coach Christos Tzekos was blamed for the missed tests and suspended for four years, but was cleared on separate allegations of distributing banned substances. After a long legal battle, on 26 June 2006 prior to a final ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the athletes reached an out of court settlement with the IAAF accepting anti-doping rule violations of 3 missed tests between 27 July and 12 August 2004 (in breach of Rule 32.2(d)) and a failure to provide a urine and a blood sample on 12 August 2004 (in breach of Rule 32.2(c)). In return, the more serious charges against them, those of evasion and refusal to provide a sample, were dropped.&lt;ref name=&#x27;BBC Sport 06/26/2006&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They have been eligible to compete since 22 December 2006.

==Return from suspension==

On her return to international competition at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Birmingham, England, she was booed by the crowds before finishing sixth in the final of 60 metres with 7.26.

Following the revelations about Marion Jones&#x27;s use of steroids, Thanou, who finished 2nd behind Jones in the 100 m at Sydney 2000, was in line to be awarded the American&#x27;s gold medal, but due to Thanou&#x27;s own tainted record the IOC, after two years of deliberation, opted to punish Jones without rewarding Thanou. Jones&#x27; gold medal was withdrawn but was withheld by the IOC, Thanou remaining a silver medallist.

Thanou was provisionally selected by the Hellenic Olympic Committee to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She had not achieved the Olympic &#x27;A&#x27; standard (11.32 seconds), but as no other Greek woman had achieved this, she was selected as part of the team.

However, all of this became moot on 9 August 2008, when the executive board of the IOC decided to bar Thanou from competing under rule 23.2.1 of the Olympic charter. This rule allows the banning of athletes who are thought to be guilty of improper conduct or bringing the games into disrepute. Thanou claimed that she faced &quot;intense pressure&quot; to withdraw from the Beijing Olympics, four years after being involved in a major doping controversy at the Athens Games. Thanou qualified for the Beijing Games, and although she had threatened to sue Jacques Rogge, the IOC president, she was finally denied permission to participate.

== Conviction and subsequent acquittal==
Thanou was tried in 2009 for making false statements to police, to avoid a doping test, on the eve of the 2004 Athens Olympics. On 9 May 2011, Thanou and Kenteris were convicted of perjury and received suspended sentences of 31 months against which they immediately appealed. The judge declared that the &quot;motor accident at the Olympic Games in reality had never taken place&quot;. On 6 September 2011, the Guardian newspaper reported that Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou had been acquitted by a Greek appeals court of faking a motorcycle crash after missing a drugs test.

<text>The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine was a monthly magazine founded in London, England, by Edward Cave in January 1731. It ran uninterrupted for almost 200 years, until 1922. It was the first to use the term &quot;magazine&quot; (from the French &quot;magazine&quot;, meaning &quot;storehouse&quot;) for a periodical. Samuel Johnson&#x27;s first regular employment as a writer was with &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==History==
The original complete title was &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine: or, Trader&#x27;s monthly intelligencer&quot;. Cave&#x27;s innovation was to create a monthly digest of news and commentary on any topic the educated public might be interested in, from commodity prices to Latin poetry. It carried original content from a stable of regular contributors, as well as extensive quotations and extracts from other periodicals and books. Cave, who edited &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; under the pen name &quot;Sylvanus Urban&quot;, was the first to use the term &quot;magazine&quot; (meaning &quot;storehouse&quot;) for a periodical. Contributions to the magazine frequently took the form of letters, addressed to &quot;Mr. Urban&quot;. The iconic illustration of St John&#x27;s Gate, Clerkenwell, on the front of each issue (occasionally updated over the years) depicted Cave&#x27;s home, in effect, the magazine&#x27;s &quot;office&quot;.

Before the founding of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, there were specialised journals, but no such wide-ranging publications (although there had been attempts, such as &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, which was edited by Peter Motteux and ran from 1692 to 1694).

Samuel Johnson&#x27;s first regular employment as a writer was with &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. During a time when parliamentary reporting was banned, Johnson regularly contributed parliamentary reports as &quot;Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia&quot;. Though they reflected the positions of the participants, the words of the debates were mostly Johnson&#x27;s own. The name &quot;Columbia&quot;, a poetic name for America coined by Johnson, first appears in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament in the magazine.

The magazine&#x27;s long-running motto, &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;, Latin for &quot;Out of many, one&quot;, is thought to have inspired the use of the phrase as an unofficial motto of the United States. Motteux&#x27;s &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Journal&quot; had previously used the phrase.

A skilled businessman, Edward Cave developed an extensive distribution system for &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It was read throughout the English-speaking world and continued to flourish through the 18th century and much of the 19th century under a series of different editors and publishers. It went into decline towards the end of the 19th century and finally ceased general publication in September 1907. However, issues consisting of four pages each were printed in very small editions between late 1907 and 1922 in order to keep the title formally &quot;in print&quot;.

==Series==

*1731–1735: &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; or &quot;Monthly Intelligencer&quot;
*1736–1833: &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and Historical Chronicle
*1834–1856 (June) New Series: &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;

*1868 (June)–1922 Entirely New Series: &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;

==Indexes==
In addition to an index for each year of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which was usually published with the December issue of the magazine, a full index was compiled by the College of Arms and typed by the Genealogical Society of Utah. This 75-volume index, covering the years 1731–1850, gives the full name and an abbreviated reference to the date, event, and any other person(s) in each entry. The index is available at the Family History Library (FHL) under the call number 942 B2g Index, and is also available on microfilm (#599738–#599761) or microfiche (#6026701). In addition to the index, the FHL also has the magazine itself available in various formats.

An abstract of the &quot;chief contents of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1731 to 1868&quot; was published by George L. Gomme in 1891. He describes it as &quot;excerpts from the original publications containing local history and information, topographical details, and family history are presented here, organized into volumes by county&quot;. Gomme&#x27;s work has been digitised and indexed by Ancestry.com and is available online to Ancestry subscribers or at subscribing libraries.

A four-volume set of indexes was compiled by Samuel Ayscough (Assistant Librarian of the British Museum) with some assistance or later editing by John Nichols and by Gabriel Richard. The contents of these indexes are given as:

David Dobson gleaned references to American births, marriages, and deaths from &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and published it as &quot;American Vital Records from the Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine, 1731–1868&quot; (Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Co., 1987).

A few partial indexes to genealogical events in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; are also available:

<text>Looney Labs, Inc. is a small game company based in College Park, Maryland, United States. It is named after its founders, Andrew Looney and Kristin Looney, and is best known for creating the Fluxx line of card games. The company has three U.S. patents and eight Origins Awards.

The company&#x27;s games are distributed by ACD Distribution, Alliance Game Distributors and GTS for the US hobby game market, Lion Rampant for Canada and Publisher Services, Inc. for U.S. mass market and book trade and the international market.

==Icehouse Games: predecessor company==
Andrew and Kristin Looney previously entered game design and manufacturing with Icehouse Games which was started to manufacture pieces for the formerly fictional &quot;IceHouse&quot; game in 1989. In 1996, Looney shut down Icehouse Games, Inc. as the cost to create Icehouse pyramid molds would cost $12,000 and to focus on designing a card game.

==History==

===Home based===
Andrew Looney soon designed the &quot;Fluxx&quot; card game. Looney Laboratories was launched in 1996 as a part-time home based design company soon adding a nearby storage unit as a warehouse. Fluxx was licensed out to Iron Crown Enterprises to publish. At the 1998 Origins International Game Expo and Fair in Columbus, Ohio, Looney launched its &quot;Aquarius&quot; card game. Proton and Q-Turn were design in 1998–1999. Alison Frane started working at Looney Labs with Fluxx using her artistic abilities. The company&#x27;s November 1999 weekly web zine officially launched its Mad Lab Rabbit fan demo program.

Iron Crown went into bankruptcy thus the Looney triggered the license provision allowing the rights to revert to the company. Lab then decided to publish &quot;Fluxx&quot; in house instead of finding another publisher. Kristin Looney by 2000 quit her job to work full-time. By 2000, the company re-released Icehouse as &quot;&quot;, released &quot;Chrononauts&quot; and a new printing of &quot;Fluxx&quot; (version 2.1). &quot;Icehouse&quot; sold poorly in stores while selling briskly on the company&#x27;s website.

In summer 2001, ACMS, later renamed Print Mail Communications (PMC), took over from the storage unit as warehousing and distribution company. In 2001, &quot;IceHouse&quot; and &quot;Chrononauts&quot; both won Origins Awards 2000 while Looney Labs published &quot;Cosmic Coasters&quot;, &quot;Fluxx Blanxx&quot;, and &quot;Chrononauts: Lost Identities&quot;. Icehouse pieces were released as monochrome stash tubes in 2001.

Andrew Looney became full-time by 2002. Labs released in 2002 &quot;Nanofictionary&quot;, &quot;Are You a Werewolf?&quot; and a new &quot;Fluxx&quot; primary version. In 2003, the company expanded the Fluxx line with its first themed variant and a licensed German language version.

Looney Labs found in 2004 that an unaware Covenant Communications had published a rip-off of their game, &quot;Aquarius&quot;, as &quot;Search, Ponder, and Play!&quot; in 2003, for which Labs reached a licensing deal with Covenant. In 2004, the Zendo icehouse set won &quot;Best Abstract Board Game of 2003&quot;. while in 2005 the set won the Mensa Select Game Award.

===Apartment based===
Company offices moved to Janet&#x27;s Attic, an attic apartment in their friends&#x27; house several blocks away in early 2005. By October 2005, &quot;EcoFluxx&quot; was in play testing while &quot;Just Desserts&quot; was in prototype, or beta stage.

Robin Vinopal joined the company in early 2006 becoming Chief Operating Officer, Treasurer, and member of the Board of Directors. In 2006, Lab revamped their Icehouse sets to the Treehouse main set plus two color schemes and also released &quot;Martian Coasters&quot;. With the 2007 publishing of &quot;Zombie Fluxx&quot; the first new type of card, Creeper, is introduced. Also in 2007, the Mad Rabbits fan/demo program was shut down.

With Frane&#x27;s purchase of a house, Pepperland, in 2008, the company moved into its basement apartment. Product wise that year, Labs released edition 4 &quot;Fluxx&quot; and worked with Toy Vault to release &quot;Monty Python Fluxx&quot;. The company began using a standard two-part box instead of to-fit tuck box for a consistent look and shelving ease.

In , Looney Labs published one new card game, &quot;Are You the Traitor?&quot;, another Fluxx variant, new editions of its two other card games and a few expansion sets while starting to use a postcard promo card for marketing. The company on started distributing through Publisher Services, Inc. for international accounts, and to the book trade. On , Labs launched its Full Baked Ideas imprint with a new edition of &quot;Stoner Fluxx&quot; and expectations for a drinking variant of Fluxx.

The &quot;Back to the Future: The Card Game&quot; was released in 2010 along with two Fluxx re-releases in the new box format. Two new Fluxx variants debuted in 2011 that saw the IceHouse pyramids re-released with a new lead game set, IceDice. The company&#x27;s fan/demo club was restarted in 2011.

The company on reduced the number of distribution companies that they ship through to ACD Distribution and Alliance Game Distributors for the US hobby game market, Lion Rampant for Canada and Publisher Services, Inc. for U.S. mass market and book trade and the international market. ACD and Alliance would also make their supporting material available via subscription.

On August 1, 2012, Looney Labs got a simplified less expensive general market version with redesigned packaging of &quot;Fluxx&quot; into Target stores. On February 7, 2013, Labs released the 2.0 edition of &quot;Nanofictionary&quot; as a print on demand product.

===Office based===
In August 2013, the company moved from Pepperland basement to the top floor of The Sterling Building, an actual office complex. In May 2015, Labs changed its fulfillment company from PMC to Excel. Lab added in mid-2015 GTS as another distributor.

&quot;Loonacy&quot; was released in March 2014 and won the Parents&#x27; Choice FunStuff Award Spring 2014 Games. While two other &quot;Loonacy&quot; versions were released in the next two following years.

In 2017, Looney Labs had multiple releases with three Fully Baked Ideas summer releases of variants of existing games, a revived &quot;Nanofictionary&quot; version, a few variants of Fluxx including &quot;Chemistry Fluxx&quot; and &quot;Zendo&quot;. In December 2017, the company reissued &quot;Zendo&quot; game separate from the Looney pyramids line for the first time.

Graphic artist Mary Engelbreit was signed to a licensing deal in February 2018 with Looney Labs&#x27; for versions of Fluxx and Loonacy games to be released in the third quarter 2018. Two second quarter games were also scheduled, a new Fluxx set and &quot;Get the MacGuffin&quot; card game.

<doc id="891200" wikidata="Q7240104" url="?curid=891200" title="Prelude to the Warsaw Uprising">
<text>The [[Warsaw Uprising]] occurred at a stage of the Second World War when it was becoming clear that Nazi Germany was likely to lose. The Uprising ended in capitulation, the deaths of over 250,000 civilians, and only 15% of Warsaw intact; with the benefit of hindsight, many people have argued that it should never have been started. Others have argued that it was inevitable and even crucial for Poland to prove its commitment to the Allied cause. Although Stalin was later to describe it as a &quot;criminal enterprise&quot;, just two days prior to its initiation, Radio Moscow had called for the Polish people to rise in arms.

Research in the circumstances that led up to the initiation of the Uprising is difficult because the facts are not always fully available: there are still some sources of information, such as the British and Soviet archives, which remain closed . Therefore, analysis of the Uprising must also incorporate the speculation, past and present, concerning the time prior to the uprising.

== Operation Tempest ==
From the very beginning of its existence the Home Army was planning a national uprising against the German forces. Initial plans created by the Polish government-in-exile in 1942 assumed that the allied invasion of Europe would lead to the withdrawal of considerable German forces from the Eastern Front for the defence of the Third Reich. The Home Army would act to prevent troop transfer to the west and to allow the British and American forces to seize Germany by breaking all communication links with the majority of German forces massed in the Soviet Union.

However, by 1943 it became apparent that the allied invasion of Europe would not come in time, and that in all probability the Red Army would reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the invasion had well begun. In February 1943 general Stefan Rowecki amended the plan. The Uprising was to be started in three phases, the first being in the East (with main centres of resistance in Lwów and Wilno), before the advancing Red Army. The second part was to include armed struggle in the belt between the Curzon Line and the Vistula river, while the third part was to be a nationwide uprising in all of Poland.

Polish-Soviet relations were broken off on April 25, 1943, due to the Katyn massacre, and it became obvious that the advancing Red Army might not come to Poland as a liberator but rather, as General Rowecki put it, &quot;Our Allies&#x27; Ally&quot;. On November 26, 1943, the Polish government in exile issued an instruction to the effect that if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before their entry to Poland, the Home Army forces were to remain underground until further decisions were made. However, the Home Army commander took a different approach, and on November 30, 1943, the final version of the plan was created. It became known as Operation Tempest.

== Diplomacy with the Soviets and other Allies ==

The Warsaw Uprising, or at least some form of insurrection in Poland, had been planned long in advance. Warsaw was chosen, partially, because of its status as a pre-war capital. The Allies foresaw that the Germans would wish to hold onto Warsaw for as long as possible, as a tool of morale, communications and supply and troop movement. The Polish government-in-exile strongly wanted support from the other Allied countries. For this reason they carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from their allies prior to the start of battle. Although there were supply drops by American, British, and Polish forces prior to, and during the Uprising, most fell uselessly into German hands. This left the Polish Home Army forces seriously under-supplied.

== The Soviet advance ==
The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of the influence of Polish Government in Exile and as a direct operation against German occupiers. The fear was that in the aftermath of the war the allies would ignore the legal London-based government. It was clear that Poland would be liberated by the Red Army, and that the Soviet Union did not recognise the Government-in-Exile.

Initially, after the Red Army forces crossed the pre-war Polish borders, the local Home Army units were engaged in successful cooperation with the Soviets in liberating several towns and cities. However, in most cases after the struggle ended the Polish officers and members of local administration were caught by the NKVD and either shot or sent to Gulags and prisons in Russia. At the same time most of the Polish soldiers caught by the Soviets were given the choice of either joining the Soviet-backed Polish People&#x27;s Army or sharing the fate of their officers. 

Nevertheless, the Soviet advance was fast, and the Polish authorities saw no other choice but to continue the struggle against the German forces and aid the Soviets. At the same time the government in London asked the SOE and the Foreign Office several times for an allied mission to Poland to be sent; such missions had already been dispatched to all resistance movements in Europe, including Albania, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Yugoslavia. However, the pleas were not fulfilled until December 1944.

The official line of Soviet propaganda was that the Polish underground was &quot;waiting with their arms at ease&quot; and was not fighting the common enemy. As the Soviet forces were nearing Warsaw in June and July 1944, the Soviet radio stations demanded a full national uprising in Warsaw to cut the communication lines of the German units still on the right bank of the Vistula. On July 29, 1944, the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw.

With the recent flood of reports from the eastern territories about forced demilitarisation, trials and execution of Home Army soldiers by the Soviets, on 21 July 1944 the High Command of the Home Army decided to expand the scope of the Operation Tempest to include Warsaw itself. The date for the Warsaw Uprising was set to 1 August. The uprising began at the end of the Soviet offensive Operation Bagration.

== German defensive preparations ==
By the end of July the town had been declared &quot;Festung Warschau&quot; (Fortress Warsaw) by the Germans. It was to be defended at all cost against the Soviet offensive. However, the July 20 Plot and the failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler made many German units withdraw westward through Warsaw. The Home Army saw it as a sign of defeat of the Germans. The number of German soldiers in the area was lowered significantly.

On July 27, governor of the General Government Hans Frank called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17–65 to arrive at several assembly points in Warsaw the following day. They were to be employed at construction of fortifications for the Wehrmacht in and around the city. This move was viewed by the Home Army as an attempt to neutralise the underground forces and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it. Fearing German reprisal actions, general Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski ordered full mobilisation of Home Army forces in Warsaw area.

<text>Football Club Zenit ( ), also known as Zenit Saint Petersburg or simply Zenit, is a Russian professional football club based in Saint Petersburg. Founded in 1925 (or in 1914, according to some Russian sources), the club plays in the Russian Premier League. Zenit are the reigning champions of the Russian Premier League. Previously they won the 2007, 2010, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2018–19, 2019–20, 2020–21, 2021–22 and the 2022–23 seasons of the Russian Premier League, as well as the 2007–08 UEFA Cup and the 2008 UEFA Super Cup. The club is owned and sponsored by the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom. The team plays its home matches at the Gazprom Arena. In March 2022, the club was expelled from all European and international club competitions by FIFA and the UEFA due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In addition, the European Club Association suspended the team. On 24 May 2023, Zenit became the first Russian sports club with 10 million followers on social media.

==History==

===Before Zenit===
Zenit&#x27;s history is tightly connected with the political history of Saint Petersburg, Russia (also called &quot;Petrograd&quot; and &quot;Leningrad&quot; at times in its history). In 1897, the first officially-recorded football match in Russia was held in Saint Petersburg on Vasilievsky Island, an unofficial game between the local English team &quot;Ostrov&quot; and the local Russian team &quot;Petrograd,&quot; which the English team won, 6–0. The players of those local teams were amateurs and loosely associated with each other.

===Formation of Zenit===
The original Zenit team stemmed from several football teams, which changed names and owners many times during the Soviet era after the Revolution of 1917, as powerful political forces manipulated the careers of individual players as well as the fate of the whole team. The club was renamed several times and its owners and leaders were under political pressure for many decades. The origins of Zenit date back to the beginning of the 20th century to several predecessor teams in Saint Petersburg that were playing locally. The oldest documented predecessor of Zenit was the team &quot;Murzinka,&quot; founded in 1914, which played in the &quot;Obukhovsky&quot; stadium from 1914 until 1924, when the team came to be known as &quot;Bolshevik&quot; (the new name for &quot;Obukhovsky&quot; industry and its stadium). The team and stadium survived the drama of World War I, the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, and the Russian Civil War of 1918 to 1922.

In 1925, another predecessor team of Zenit was formed, of workers from the &quot;Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod&quot; (Leningrad Metal Plant); they were called the &quot;Stalinets&quot; in the 1930s. (&quot;Stalinets&quot; translates literally to English as &quot;Stalinist&quot;; however, in Russian, the name is a play on words as &quot;stal&quot; means &quot;steel&quot;.) Historians documented that both predecessor teams of Zenit were playing independently until their official merger at the end of 1939. The Stalinets were not the same team named Zenit that took part in the 1938 USSR championship. The current name of FC Zenit was registered in 1936 (as Bolshevik became part of the Zenit sports society and was renamed), three years before the Stalinets merged with it. The name &quot;Zenit&quot; means &quot;Zenith&quot;.

In 1939, during the rule of Joseph Stalin, Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod became part of the military industry and its sports teams, players, and managers were transferred to the Zenit sports society. FC Zenit was ordered to take in members of the &quot;Stalinets&quot; metallurgical workers&#x27; team after the end of the 1939 season.

===Zenit in the Soviet League===

Zenit won their first honours in 1944, claiming the war-time USSR Cup after defeating CSKA Moscow in the well-attended final. The club was always adored in Leningrad, but was not able to make much of a significant impact in the Soviet League. In 1967, Zenit finished last but were saved from relegation because the Soviet leadership decided it would not be prudent to relegate a Leningrad team during the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, which occurred in the city. Composer Dmitry Shostakovich and film star Kirill Lavrov were well known as ardent supporters of Zenit, a passion that is reflected in their attendance of many games. Zenit won the bronze medal in 1980, also reaching the Soviet Cup Final and winning the Soviet League title in 1984. In 1985, Zenit beat the Soviet Cup holder in the Soviet Super Cup (also called the Season Cup).

===Zenit in the Russian League===
The LOMO optical plant took up the ownership of the team after the war. In 1990, FC Zenit were re-registered as an independent city-owned professional club. In 1992, After being relegated in the first year of the Russian League, Zenit returned to the top flight in 1996 and has been decent since. They claimed the 1999 Russian Cup, finished third in the League in 2001, made the Cup final in 2002, became the runners-up in the Premier League and won the Russian Premier League Cup in 2003.

===Gazprom era===
In December 2005, Gazprom took a controlling stake in the club. The deal was announced by Valentina Matviyenko, the Saint Petersburg governor. Gazprom bought the majority of the club.

====Under Advocaat====

Although Zenit reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 2006, a mediocre start to the league season led to the summer replacement of coach Vlastimil Petržela. In July 2006, Dick Advocaat took over as Zenit&#x27;s manager. Advocaat worked together with his assistant manager, former Netherlands national youth team coach Cor Pot. Zenit won the 2007 Russian Premier League—their best league achievement since winning the USSR Championship in 1984—allowing them to compete in the group stage of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League.

In 2008, Zenit won the Russian Super Cup and reached the quarter-final of the UEFA Cup for the second time in their history. In the first leg of the quarter-final away game against German side Bayer Leverkusen, the team achieved a 4–1 victory. They qualified for the semi-finals of the competition for the first time in their history, despite a 1–0 home loss to Leverkusen in the second leg, and were drawn to play further German opposition in the semi-final, Bayern Munich, considered the top team remaining. A battling performance in the first leg of the semi-final earned Zenit a 1–1 draw away against Bayern Munich. In the second leg at home, Zenit won 4–0, defeating Bayern 5–1 on aggregate and going through to the UEFA Cup Final for the first time in club history, where they met Scottish side Rangers at the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester on 14 May. Zenit won 2–0, with goals from Igor Denisov in the 72nd minute and Konstantin Zyryanov in stoppage time, to lift the club&#x27;s first-ever UEFA Cup. Andrey Arshavin was named man of the match.

On 29 August 2008, at the Stade Louis II in Monaco, Zenit then defeated Manchester United 2–1 in the 2008 UEFA Super Cup, becoming the first Russian side to win the trophy. Pavel Pogrebnyak scored the first goal and Danny scored the second, the latter being named man of the match in his debut for Zenit.

In the 2008–09 Champions League group stage, Zenit was grouped with Real Madrid, Juventus and BATE Borisov in Group H, which by some was marked as the &quot;group of death.&quot; Zenit ultimately finished in third place in the group, behind Juventus and Real Madrid, and was thus unable to progress to the knockout phase of the competition. This position, however, was good enough to earn the club a place in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup last 32, where the team faced VfB Stuttgart for a place in the last 16 of the competition. After defeating Stuttgart on away goals, Zenit went on to lose 2–1 over two legs against Italian club Udinese.

====Under Spalletti====
Luciano Spalletti signed a contract with Zenit in December 2009, with Italian coaches Daniele Baldini, Marco Domenichini and Alberto Bartali also joining the Russian club. The Board of Zenit mandated him to return the Russian Premier League title to Zenit, win the Russian Cup and progress from the group stage of the Champions League in his first year.

Zenit won the Russian Cup on 16 May 2010 after beating Sibir Novosibirsk in the final (previously beating Volga Tver in the quarter-finals and Amkar Perm in the semi-finals). After 16 games in the 2010 Premier League, with 12 wins and four draws, Zenit claimed 40 points, setting a new Russian Premier League record for most points won at that stage of the campaign.
On 25 August 2010, Zenit lost its first game under Spalletti to French side Auxerre and failed to advance to the Champions League group stage, instead participating in the Europa League. On 3 October, Zenit beat Spartak Nalchik to set another Russian Premier League record for most consecutive games going undefeated, with 21 games since the start of the league season. On 27 October, however, Zenit suffered its first defeat of the season at the hands of rival club Spartak Moscow, just seven games short of finishing the championship undefeated. On 14 November, Zenit defeated Rostov and two games prior to the end of the season won the championship title, the first in Spalletti&#x27;s managerial career.

Zenit progressed through the knockout stage of the 2010–11 Europa League in first place, then beating Swiss side Young Boys in the Round of 16. On 6 March 2011, Zenit won against CSKA Moscow in the Russian Super Cup, the third Russian trophy won under Spalletti. On 17 March, however, Zenit were knocked out of the Europa League, losing to Dutch team Twente 2–3 on aggregate in the quarter-finals.

In the 2011–12 Champions League, Zenit began the group stage drawn into Group G alongside Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and APOEL. On 6 December 2011, the team finished the group stage in second place and for the first time in club&#x27;s history qualified for the spring knockout phase of Champions League. In the Round of 16, Zenit were drawn with Portuguese side Benfica, winning the first leg 3–2 at home through two goals from Roman Shirokov and one from Sergei Semak. In the second leg in Lisbon, however, Zenit lost 2–0 and were thus eliminated from the competition.

In April 2012, Zenit won their second-straight Russian Championship after beating Dynamo Moscow.

====Under Villas-Boas====
After a series of disappointing results in both the Champions League and the Premier League, Spalletti was fired on 11 March 2014. A week later, the club announced they had negotiated a two-year deal with André Villas-Boas, who himself had been released a few months prior after a disappointing stint as manager of English side Tottenham Hotspur. In the 2014–15 Europa League, Zenit were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual champions Sevilla. In May 2015, Zenit won the Russian Championship, the first championship title under Villas-Boas and the team&#x27;s fifth-ever on the eve of its 90th anniversary celebration. Zenit then defeated Lokomotiv Moscow in the 2015 Russian Super Cup 1–1 (4–2 on penalties).

Later in the 2015 calendar year, Villas-Boas said that he would be leaving the club after the 2015–16 season. In the 2015–16 Champions League, Zenit began the competition in the group stage. They were drawn in Group H alongside Valencia, Lyon and Gent. They ended the group stage with their best group stage finish ever, winning five out of six matches and emerging as group winners. They were, however, eliminated from the competition in the Round of 16 by Portuguese side Benfica.

On 24 May 2016 Villas-Boas left the club at the end of the season, with Mircea Lucescu appointed the new manager of Zenit.

====Under Lucescu and Mancini====
In July 2016 Zenit won the Russian Super Cup after a 0–1 victory over CSKA Moscow.

During the 2016–17 Europa League, Zenit began the group stage drawn into Group D alongside Maccabi Tel Aviv, AZ Alkmaar and Dundalk. On 8 December 2016, the team finished the group stage in first place and qualified for the spring knockout phase of Europa League. In the round of 32, Zenit faced R.S.C. Anderlecht and was eliminated 3–3 on aggregate due to the away goals rule. In the league, Zenit&#x27;s performances in the spring were disappointing and as such the club finished third and missed out on the Champions League for the second year in a row. Zenit was also eliminated in the round of 16 by FC Anzhi Makhachkala 0–4 on aggregate after an abysmal performance. The first (and last) season of Mircea Lucescu was a complete disappointment despite the expectations.

On 1 June 2017 Zenit appointed Roberto Mancini as the new manager of the team. On 13 May 2018, Mancini terminated his contract by mutual consent.

====Under Semak====

In May 2018, Mancini left to become the head coach of the Italy national football team. Sergey Semak became the new manager of Zenit, receiving a two-year contract.

In August 2018, during the 1st leg of the 3rd qualification round of the UEFA Europa League, Zenit suffered a 0–4 loss to Dynamo Minsk. During the 2nd leg back on home ground, Zenit made a comeback winning 8–1, scoring 3 goals in the second half and 4 goals in the second half of the extra time, with 2 goals scored in the 120th minute. Zenit went on to beat Molde FK 4–3 on aggregate in the next round, entering the group stage of 2018-19 UEFA Europa League.

In March 2020, the league was forced to halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia. Zenit secured another title on 5 July 2020 after a victory over FC Krasnodar, with 4 games left to play in the tournament.

On 2 May 2021, Zenit secured their third title in a row in a 6–1 victory over second-place FC Lokomotiv Moscow. Zenit opened the 2021–22 season with a seventh win in the Russian Super Cup after a 3–0 win over Lokomotiv Moscow, but without major key players who left the club like Yuri Zhirkov, Andrei Lunev, and Sebastián Driussi.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, former Ukrainian international Yaroslav Rakitskiy made a pro-Ukrainian post on Instagram and severed his contract with the team. FIFA and the UEFA indefinitely suspended the team from their competitions. In addition, the European Club Association suspended the team.

On 30 April 2022, Zenit secured their fourth title in a row and eighth overall. Many of Zenit&#x27;s foreign players have not been able to leave Russia, unable to secure moves away from Russian clubs, due to international sanctions placed upon the country as a result of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

On 7 May 2023, Zenit secured their fifth title in a row and ninth overall.

In 2024, Zenit was one of the organizers of the Equality Cup, an international football tournament.

On 25 May 2024, Zenit won their sixth title in a row dramatically on the last day of the season, as league-leading Dynamo Moscow lost to third-placed Krasnodar, allowing Zenit to come back to the top. The winning goal in Zenit&#x27;s game against Rostov was scored in the 85th minute by Artur. On 2 June 2024, Zenit won the Russian Cup with a late-comeback 2–1 victory over Baltika Kaliningrad, Nuraly Alip scored the winning goal in the 5th added minute. On 13 July 2024, Zenit won the 2024 Russian Super Cup.

==Stadiums==
Zenit&#x27;s home ground is now the 67,800-capacity Krestovsky Stadium, known as Gazprom Arena for sponsorship reasons, in Saint Petersburg. Petrovsky Stadium used to be the home ground of the team before the new Krestovsky Stadium was built. Before moving to the Petrovsky Stadium, Zenit&#x27;s home ground was the Kirov Stadium. It stood on the site where the Krestovsky Stadium was later erected.

Zenit&#x27;s reserve squad played professionally as Zenit-2 (Russian Second League in 1993, Russian Second Division from 1998 to 2000) and Zenit-d (Russian Third League from 1994 to 1997). Another team that was founded as Lokomotiv-Zenit-2 played as Zenit-2 in the Russian Second Division from 2001 to 2008. By 2008, there was no relation between that team and FC Zenit. Another farm club called FC Smena-Zenit debuted in the Russian Second Division in 2009, taking the spot of the former FC Zenit-2. FC Smena-Zenit was dissolved after the 2009 season because it did not fulfill Zenit&#x27;s initial expectations. Zenit-2 reentered professional football in the 2013–14 season in the Russian Professional Football League.

<text>Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport () is an international airport situated in the town of Ob, west of the center of Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia.

==Overview==
There are two ( and ) active runways in Tolmachevo Airport, along with one large passenger terminal with two connected sections (Section A for domestic flights (, 18 check-in desks, 2 jet bridges, capacity 1,800 passengers/hour, and Section B for international flights (, 14 check-in desks, 3 jet bridges, capacity 1,300 passengers/hour), 2 cargo terminals and 61 aircraft stands. Runway 16 is equipped with an ILS CAT II, which enables aircraft operations in low ceiling (30 metres) and visibility (350 metres).

The airport is situated in the middle of the route from some important East-Asian cities (e.g. Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong, etc.) to Europe which makes it attractive for cargo airlines to use it for refueling stops. It serves also as a diversion airport on Polar route 1.
Tolmachevo is the busiest airport in Siberia and the sixth-busiest airport in Russia. It is also the busiest regional transit airport in Russia after Moscow MOW. In 2020, the airport served 4,634,166 passengers (-31.3%) and handled 34,158 tons of cargo (+0.05%). Detailed data for years 2003–2020 is in the Traffic Statistics section below.

The Tolmachevo Airport is operated by Novaport since 2011.

==History==
Operations began on July 12, 1957, with the first passenger flight of a Tupolev Tu-104 from Novosibirsk to Moscow. The airport was owned by United Tolmachevo Aviation Enterprise and the Ministry of Civil Aviation of the USSR until 1992. The airport then became a joint stock company in 1995, with 51% owned by the state. The domestic terminal was completely renovated in 2006. Tolmachevo Airport is also the first Russian airport to receive an ISO 9002-96 certificate. On November 29, 2012, for the first time in its history, the airport received its three-millionth annual passenger. During 2014-2015, the former international terminal was enlarged and merged with the domestic terminal which doubled its passenger capacity. The airport celebrated its four-millionth annual passenger on December 21, 2016. In the last hours of 2017, another milestone was reached: on December 31, 2017, the airport handled its five-millionth annual passenger. On December 18, 2019, the airport celebrated its first 6.5-millionth annual passenger.

Plans for its further development include construction of a new rapid-exit taxiway and 4 stands for wide-body aircraft, On 15 September 2020 the airport commenced construction works of the new terminal. Work is being conducted by contractor Ant Yapı (Turkey). Construction of the 56,000 square meters terminal will be completed in the third quarter of 2022. Phase two work will be completed by 2025. The total area of the airport terminal will be more than 100,000 square meters.

The airport is also home to the 337th Independent Helicopter Regiment (previously called the 562nd Air Base (Army Aviation)) flying Mil Mi-24P&#x27;s and Mil Mi-8AMTSh-V&#x27;s and the Composite Aviation Squadron, 32nd Independent Composite Transport Aviation Regiment, both as part of the 14th Air and Air Defence Forces Army.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 13 November 2020, an Antonov An-124 Ruslan aircraft operating Volga-Dnepr Airlines Flight 4066 suffered an uncontained engine failure on departure and was severely damaged. On landing back at Tolmachevo, the aircraft overran the runway and was further damaged when its nosewheels collapsed. All fourteen people on board survived.

<doc id="891219" wikidata="Q3460673" url="?curid=891219" title="Wolf's Castle">
<text>Wolf&#x27;s Castle (), also spelt Wolfscastle, is a village and community in Pembrokeshire, between Haverfordwest and Fishguard, in southwest Wales. It was historically in the parish of St Dogwells.

== Geography and transport links ==
Wolfscastle comprises two small villages; Wolfscastle proper, at the top of a hill, and Ford, situated in the river valley below. The remains of a motte and bailey castle lie in the upper village, a strategic location determined by its situation at the northern end of Treffgarne gorge. The village lies at the confluence of the Western Cleddau and the Anghof rivers, in the parish of St Dogwell&#x27;s.

The A40 road, the London to Fishguard trunk route, passes through Wolfscastle and provides the main transport route to and from the village, with a regular bus service connecting with the major towns of the area.

The main railway line from Swansea to Fishguard Harbour passes through Ford. At one time, there was a station named at the point where the A40 road crosses the railway for both passengers and the loading of milk from local farms, but this was closed in 1964 when the local train service between Fishguard and Clarbeston Road was withdrawn. At the present time (2018) the line carries two daily services each way between Swansea and Fishguard Harbour, timed to connect at Swansea with services from London Paddington and at Fishguard with the Irish ferry service to Rosslare, plus a limited number of local services between Fishguard, Clarbeston Road and Haverfordwest. The latter were reintroduced in 2012, almost fifty years after being withdrawn, but the station at Wolf&#x27;s Castle was not reopened as part of this initiative.

== History ==
Musland Farm was once the residence of Captain William Davies Evans, the first utiliser of the Evans Gambit in chess.

The castle formed part of the series of defences constructed by the Normans after 1093 known as the Landsker Line, providing a general boundary between the English-speaking south and the Welsh-speaking north.

A Romano-British villa was excavated by the antiquarian Richard Fenton, hinting that Roman influence extended further west than had previously been thought. It has been subjected to a recent investigation to ascertain its exact location.

The railway from Clarbeston Road station to Letterston Junction, 4¾ miles along the line north of the village, opened in 1906, replacing the former North Pembrokeshire &amp; Fishguard Railway route from Clynderwen to Fishguard via Maenclochog and Rosebush, which did not pass close to Wolf&#x27;s Castle.

== Economy ==
Mainly agricultural due to its rural location, the village does boast both the Wolfscastle Country Hotel and a public house, the &quot;Wolfe Inn&quot;. Agriculture involves dairy, sheep and beef farming, and several farms can be found within the village and its environs.

Previous economic assets included slate quarrying near Sealyham, roadstone quarrying in Treffgarne gorge and a village post office, all of which have ceased operating. Also, the running of the hall merited the employment of staff.

== Community ==
A Welsh Independent chapel, known as Pen-y-Bont, stands near the river in Ford. Several churches are to be found in the area – St Margaret&#x27;s in Wolfscastle itself, St Michael&#x27;s in Treffgarne, and St Dogfael&#x27;s at St Dogwells (a grade II* listed building).

A community council meets monthly in the village. Every summer the Wolfscastle Festival week is held and the community council sponsors the village&#x27;s annual entry in the Wales in Bloom competition. In 2005 the village won the Small Village Trophy and was runner-up in 2006. A small, twin-classroom County Primary school, built in 1834, completes the community aspect of the village.

Both of his parents are of part French Canadian descent, along with some German, English, Scottish, and Irish. He and his family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives. Because of his father&#x27;s work, they &quot;moved around a lot&quot; and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario and Burlington, Ontario. His parents divorced when he was 13, and he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother, an experience Gosling has credited with programming him &quot;to think like a girl&quot;.

Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School, Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson High School. As a child, he watched &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and was inspired to become an actor. He &quot;hated&quot; being a child, was bullied in elementary school, and had no friends until he was &quot;14 or 15&quot;. In grade one, having been heavily influenced by the action film &quot;First Blood&quot;, he took steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a suspension. He was unable to read, and was evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but was not diagnosed with it and, contrary to false reports, never took medication. His mother left her job and home-schooled him for a year. He has said homeschooling gave him &quot;a sense of autonomy that I&#x27;ve never really lost&quot;. Gosling performed in front of audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being a performer. He and his sister sang together at weddings; he performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle&#x27;s Elvis Presley tribute act, and was involved with a local ballet company. Performing boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing for which he received praise. He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent did not sound &quot;tough&quot;. He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando. Gosling dropped out of high school at age 17 to focus on his acting career.

==Acting career==

===1993–1999: Career beginnings===
In 1993, 12-year-old Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. He was given a two-year contract as a Mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida. He has said he appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were considered more talented. Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life. Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Keri Russell, and JC Chasez. Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in him &quot;this great sense of focus.&quot; He was specifically close friends with Timberlake because they lived together for six months during the second year of the show. Timberlake&#x27;s mother became Gosling&#x27;s legal guardian after his own mother had to return to Canada for work reasons. Gosling has said that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still supportive of each other.

Following the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1995, Gosling returned to Canada, where he continued to appear in family entertainment television series, including &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; (1995) and &quot;Goosebumps&quot; (1996), and starred in &quot;Breaker High&quot; (1997–98) as Sean Hanlon. At age eighteen, he moved to New Zealand to film the Fox Kids adventure series &quot;Young Hercules&quot; (1998–1999) as the title character. He later said that he initially enjoyed working on the series, but began to care too much about the show, so it was no longer fun for him. He wanted to spend more time sitting with and devising a character as well as play a variety of roles, so he chose to transition into film and not accept any more television work.

===2000–2003: Independent films===
Aged 19, Gosling decided to move into &quot;serious acting&quot;. He was dropped by his agent and initially found it difficult to secure work because of the &quot;stigma&quot; attached to children&#x27;s television. After a supporting role in the football drama &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, he secured a lead role as a young Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Believer&quot;. Director Henry Bean said he cast Gosling because his Mormon upbringing helped him understand the isolation of Judaism. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised an &quot;electrifying and terrifyingly convincing&quot; performance while Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; felt his &quot;dynamite performance&quot; could &quot;scarcely have been better&quot;. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and Gosling has described it as &quot;the film that kind of gift-wrapped for me the career that I have now.&quot; Because of the controversial nature of the film, it was difficult to secure financial backing for a full theatrical release, and the film was instead broadcast on Showtime. The film was a commercial failure, grossing $416,925 worldwide from a production budget of $1.5 million.

In 2002, Gosling co-starred in the psychological thriller &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; with Sandra Bullock and Michael Pitt, where Gosling and Pitt portrayed a pair of high school seniors who believe they can commit the perfect murder. Bullock played the detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described him as &quot;a phenomenal talent even in junk like this&quot; while Todd McCarthy felt that the &quot;strong and &quot;charismatic&quot; young actors were &quot;let down by the screenplay&quot;. The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 million. His second screen appearance of 2002 was in &quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot; with David Morse which explores the relationship between a high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work with Morse made him &quot;a better actor&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Gosling as &quot;major star material&quot; with a &quot;rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon&quot; while Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was won over by his &quot;raw talent&quot;. The film was released in just three US theatres and grossed $13,411.

In 2003, Gosling starred in &quot;The United States of Leland&quot; as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was &quot;emotionally disconnected for the whole film.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert felt that the &quot;gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes from a writer&#x27;s conceits, not from life.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that he &quot;struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché&quot; while David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; felt that his &quot;one-note, blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in &quot;The Believer&quot;&quot;. The film grossed $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.

===2004–2009: &quot;The Notebook&quot; and &quot;Half Nelson&quot;===
Gosling gained mainstream attention in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film &quot;The Notebook&quot;, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks&#x27; novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes. Gosling played Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: &quot;It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative.&quot; He sought to imbue his character with &quot;quiet strength&quot; and was inspired by Sam Shepard&#x27;s performance in &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;. Shepard co-starred in &quot;The Notebook&quot;. Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set. &quot;We inspired the worst in each other,&quot; Gosling has said. &quot;It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way.&quot; At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to &quot;bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot&quot; because he felt McAdams was uncooperative. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;spontaneous and combustible&quot; performances of the two leads and noted that, &quot;against your better judgment, you root for the pair to beat the odds against them.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Gosling&#x27;s &quot;beguiling unaffectedness&quot; and noted that &quot;it&#x27;s hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together&quot;. The film grossed over $115 million worldwide. Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards and an MTV Movie Award. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has said that the movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. &quot;The Notebook&quot; has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists.
In 2005, Gosling appeared as a disturbed young art student in &quot;Stay&quot;, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Gosling &quot;like his fans, deserves better.&quot; Todd McCarthy remarked that the &quot;capable&quot; Gosling and McGregor &quot;deliver nothing new from what they&#x27;ve shown before&quot;. The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: &quot;I had a kid come up to me on the street, 10 years old, and he says, &#x27;Are you that guy from &quot;Stay&quot;? What the f--- was that movie about?&#x27; I think that&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m just as proud if someone says, &#x27;Hey, you made me sick in that movie,&#x27; as if they say I made them cry.&quot;

Gosling next starred in 2006&#x27;s &quot;Half Nelson&quot; as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage.&quot; Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and asserted that &quot;nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance&quot;. Roger Ebert believed that his performance &quot;proves he&#x27;s one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies.&quot; Gosling garnered a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Gosling played an introvert who falls for a sex doll in the 2007 film &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot;. He drew inspiration from James Stewart&#x27;s performance in &quot;Harvey&quot;. Roger Ebert felt &quot;a film about a life-sized love doll&quot; had been turned into &quot;a life-affirming statement of hope&quot; because of &quot;a performance by Ryan Gosling that says things that cannot be said&quot;. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described his performance as &quot;a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes.&quot; However, Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt &quot;the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career.&quot; He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role. The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget.

Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller &quot;Fracture&quot;. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on. Gosling noted that he was drawn to his character, Willie, because he had flaws and seemed like a real person. He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; declared that &quot;watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood is worth the price of admission&quot;. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt it was a treat to watch &quot;the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma.&quot; The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.

Gosling was scheduled to begin filming &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of &quot;creative differences&quot; and was replaced by Mark Wahlberg. Gosling was cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds (27 kilograms) in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then &quot;began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what.&quot; Gosling later said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed.&quot; He has said the experience was &quot;an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It&#x27;s OK to be too young for a role.&quot;

===2010–2012: Widespread recognition===
Following a three-year absence from the screen, Gosling starred in five films in 2010 and 2011. &quot;I&#x27;ve never had more energy,&quot; Gosling said. &quot;I&#x27;m more excited to make films than I used to be. I used to kind of dread it. It was so emotional and taxing. But I&#x27;ve found a way to have fun while doing it. And I think that translates into the films.&quot; He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working. In 2010, he starred opposite Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance&#x27;s directorial debut, the marital drama &quot;Blue Valentine&quot;. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said &quot;you had to remind yourself you were making a film&quot;. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt he &quot;brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance&quot; while A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found him to be &quot;convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that he &quot;plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful.&quot; However, Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; felt the performance was an example of &quot;hipsterism misdirected&quot;. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million.

Gosling&#x27;s second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film &quot;All Good Things&quot; with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir David Marks, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst). Gosling found the filming process to be a &quot;dark experience&quot; and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film. When asked if he was proud of the film, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m proud of what Kirsten does in the movie.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that he &quot;gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; found the &quot;chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this empty shell of a man&quot;. Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but praised Gosling&#x27;s performance. The film grossed $644,535 worldwide. Also in 2010, Gosling narrated and produced &quot;ReGeneration&quot;, a documentary that explores the cynicism in today&#x27;s youth towards social and political causes.
2011 saw Gosling expand his horizons by appearing in three diverse, high-profile roles. He co-starred in his first comedic role in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot;, with Steve Carell and Emma Stone. Gosling took cocktail-making classes at a Los Angeles bar in preparation for his role as a smooth-talking ladies&#x27; man. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said his &quot;seductive command presence suggests we may have found our next George Clooney&quot;. Peter Travers declared him &quot;a comic knockout&quot; while Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; felt he reveals a &quot;surprising&quot; &quot;knack for comedy.&quot; He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was a box office success, grossing over $142 million worldwide. With adjustments for inflation, it is the fourth most successful of Gosling&#x27;s career.

Gosling&#x27;s first action role was in &quot;Drive&quot;, based on a novel by James Sallis. Gosling played a Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a getaway driver, and he has described the film as a &quot;violent John Hughes movie&quot;: &quot;I always thought if &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; had head-smashing it would be perfect&quot;. Roger Ebert compared Gosling to Steve McQueen and stated that he &quot;embodies presence and sincerity ... he has shown a gift for finding arresting, powerful characters [and] can achieve just about anything. Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; pondered &quot;the ongoing mystery of how he manages to have so much impact with so little apparent effort. It&#x27;s irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando.&quot; The film was a box office success, grossing $81 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.

In his final appearance of 2011, Gosling co-starred with Philip Seymour Hoffman in the political drama &quot;The Ides of March&quot; directed by George Clooney, in which he played an ambitious press secretary. Gosling partly decided to do the film to become more politically aware: &quot;I&#x27;m Canadian and so American politics aren&#x27;t really in my wheelhouse.&quot; Joe Morganstern stated that Gosling and Hoffman &quot;are eminently well equipped to play variations on their characters&#x27; main themes. Yet neither actor has great material to conjure with in the script.&quot; In a generally tepid review, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asserted that it was &quot;certainly involving to see the charismatic Gosling verbally spar with superb character actors like Hoffman and [Paul] Giamatti.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt there was &quot;one aspect to the character that Gosling can&#x27;t quite nail down, that might simply be outside his sphere, which is idealism.&quot; He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film grossed $66 million worldwide.

In 2012, Gosling filmed Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;Song to Song&quot;, but the film would not be released until 2017.

===2013–2014: Mixed critical reception and directorial debut===

In 2013&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Gangster Squad&quot;, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD officer who attempts to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot;. Stone has said she hopes they will find more projects to work together on. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as an excuse for the cast &quot;to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess.&quot; Christy Lemire of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; criticized Gosling&#x27;s &quot;weird, whispery voice&quot; and his &quot;barely developed, one-note&quot; character. However, Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt that there was &quot;a seductive power&quot; in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: &quot;But like too much else in the film, it&#x27;s a scenario that is only half played out.&quot;

In &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot;, a generational drama directed by &quot;Blue Valentine&quot;″s Derek Cianfrance, Gosling played Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks to provide for his family. The shoot was described by Gosling as &quot;the best experience I have ever had making a film.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised his performance, writing: &quot;Mr. Gosling&#x27;s cool self-possession — the only thing he was allowed to display in &quot;Drive&quot; — is complicated, made interesting, by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability.&quot; Scott Foundas of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was unimpressed: &quot;Gosling&#x27;s character verges on parody ... Gosling uses a soft, wounded half-whisper that tells us this is all some kind of put-on ... It&#x27;s a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refn&#x27;s existential Hollywood thriller, &quot;Drive&quot;, where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction.&quot; David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; remarked that he &quot;reprises his inexorable-loner routine&quot;. The film grossed $35 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.

Later in 2013, Gosling starred in the violent revenge drama &quot;Only God Forgives&quot;, directed by &quot;Drive&quot;″s Nicolas Winding Refn. Gosling undertook Muay Thai training in preparation for the role, and has described the script as &quot;the strangest thing I&#x27;ve ever read&quot;. Both the film and his performance drew negative reviews. David Edelstein of &quot;New York&quot; magazine stated, &quot;Gosling looked like a major actor as a skinhead in &quot;The Believer&quot; and a star in &quot;Half Nelson&quot;. Then he stopped acting and started posing. His performance in &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; (would God forgive that title?) is one long, moist stare&quot;. Stephen Holden of the &quot;New York Times&quot; criticized Gosling&#x27;s inability &quot;to give his automaton any suggestion of an inner life&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that Gosling, while &quot;meant to be a blank page for us to write on, often looks merely blank&quot;.

In early 2013, Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve lost perspective on what I&#x27;m doing. I think it&#x27;s good for me to take a break and reassess why I&#x27;m doing it and how I&#x27;m doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that.&quot; Gosling&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Lost River&quot; competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The &quot;fantasy noir&quot;, written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found it &quot;insufferably conceited&quot; and remarked that Gosling had lost &quot;any sense of proportion or humility.&quot; Robbie Collin of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described &quot;Lost River&quot; as &quot;mind-bogglingly pleased with itself&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot;″s Justin Chang dismissed the &quot;derivative&quot; film as a &quot;train-wreck.&quot;

===2015–present: Established actor===

In 2015, Gosling played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire &quot;The Big Short&quot;, a Best Picture nominee at the 2016 Academy Awards. David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; felt that he was &quot;smarmily funny, somehow simultaneously magnetic and repulsive; after years wandering the halls of mediocre art cinema, it&#x27;s wonderful to see him cut loose again.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said: &quot;Gosling, a virtuoso of verbal sleaze, talks directly to the camera, and he&#x27;s volcanically fierce and funny.&quot; The following year, Gosling starred in the black comedy &quot;The Nice Guys&quot;, opposite Russell Crowe, and in Damien Chazelle&#x27;s musical &quot;La La Land&quot;, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. Robbie Collin praised his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone, writing: &quot;Both stars are so attuned to each other&#x27;s pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out, perfectly formed.&quot; It emerged as one of his most commercially successful films, with earnings of over $440 million against its $30 million budget.

Gosling was signed on to work with Terrence Malick in 2004 on the biographical film &quot;Che&quot;, but later dropped out. He later starred in Malick&#x27;s &quot;Song to Song&quot; (2017), which had been filmed in 2012, and co-starred Rooney Mara, Michael Fassbender, and Natalie Portman. Also in 2017, he starred in &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, a sequel to the 1982 science fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, directed by Denis Villeneuve and co-starring Harrison Ford, who reprised his role as Rick Deckard. Gosling&#x27;s role was as Officer K, a &quot;blade runner&quot; working for the LAPD whose job it is to kill rogue bioengineered humans known as replicants. A. O. Scott found him to be perfectly cast, adding that his &quot;ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it – his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa – makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time&quot;. Despite being Gosling&#x27;s largest box office opening, grossing $31.5 million domestically, the film generally underperformed at the box office.

In 2018, Gosling portrayed Neil Armstrong, the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon in 1969, in Chazelle&#x27;s biopic &quot;First Man&quot;, based on the book &quot;First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong&quot;. Writing for IndieWire, Michael Nordine commended him for bringing &quot;quiet charisma&quot; and &quot;grace&quot; to his role, while Nicholas Barber of the BBC hailed him as the &quot;best deadpan actor in the business&quot;. He received a nomination for the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actor.

After a four-year break from film, Gosling returned starring in the 2022 spy-action thriller &quot;The Gray Man&quot;, opposite Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. The film had a limited theatrical release and was distributed by Netflix. Despite negative reviews from critics, who described the film as &quot;mediocre&quot; and full of cliches, a sequel has been announced and is in development. In the following year, Gosling starred as Ken in Greta Gerwig&#x27;s fantasy comedy &quot;Barbie&quot;, opposite Margot Robbie in the title role. He also sang the song &quot;I&#x27;m Just Ken&quot; for the film&#x27;s accompanying soundtrack as well as a cover of &quot;Push&quot; by Matchbox Twenty. His performance was acclaimed, with Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; lauding his comedic performance as &quot;peak Gosling&quot;, and &quot;Vulture&quot; Alison Willmore wrote that he &quot;comes close to stealing the movie&quot;. He received Golden Globe, Critics&#x27; Choice, SAG, BAFTA, and Academy Award nominations for his performance. He performed &quot;I&#x27;m Just Ken&quot; live at the 96th Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Original Song.

Gosling next starred in the action comedy film &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; alongside Emily Blunt. It received positive reviews from critics but did not perform well commercially. Gosling will next produce and star in &quot;Project Hail Mary&quot;, based on Andy Weir&#x27;s science fiction novel of the same name.

==Music career==

In 2007, Gosling made a solo recording called &quot;Put Me in the Car&quot; available for download on the Internet. Also that year, Gosling and his friend Zach Shields formed the indie rock band Dead Man&#x27;s Bones. The two first met in 2005 when Gosling was dating Rachel McAdams and Shields was dating her sister, Kayleen. They initially conceived of the project as a monster-themed musical but settled on forming a band when they realized putting on a stage production would be too expensive. They recorded their eponymous debut album with the Silverlake Conservatory&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Choir and learned to play all the instruments themselves. Gosling contributed vocals, piano, guitar, bass guitar and cello to the record. The album was released through ANTI- Records on October 6, 2009. &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; was won over by the &quot;unique, catchy and lovably weird record&quot; while &quot;Prefix&quot; felt the album was &quot;rarely kitschy and never inappropriate&quot;. However, &quot;Spin&quot; felt the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t reverse the rule that actors make dubious pop musicians&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; criticized its &quot;cloying, gothic preciousness&quot;.

In September 2009, Gosling and Shields had a three-night residency at LA&#x27;s Bob Baker Marionette Theater where they performed alongside dancing neon skeletons and glowing ghosts. They then conducted a thirteen-date tour of North America in October 2009, using a local children&#x27;s choir at every show. Instead of an opening act, a talent show was held each night. In September 2010, they performed at Los Angeles&#x27; FYF Festival. In 2011, the actor spoke of his intentions to record a second &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Bones&quot; album. No children&#x27;s choir will be featured on the follow-up album because &quot;it&#x27;s not very rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

==Personal life==

Gosling previously resided in New York City. He co-owns Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. He bought the restaurant on an impulse; he said he spent &quot;all [his] money&quot; on it, spent a year doing the renovation work himself, and now oversees the restaurant&#x27;s menus.

Gosling dated his &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; co-star Sandra Bullock from 2002 to 2003. He then had a relationship with his &quot;The Notebook&quot; co-star Rachel McAdams from 2005 to 2007; they briefly reunited in 2008.

Gosling has been in a relationship with his &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot; co-star Eva Mendes since September 2011. They have two daughters, born in 2014 and 2016. When asked in a 2022 interview if she and Gosling had married, Mendes said that &quot;I like to keep it all mysterious&quot;.

Gosling supports various social causes. He has worked with PETA to encourage KFC and McDonald&#x27;s to use improved methods of chicken slaughter, and on a campaign encouraging dairy farmers to stop de-horning cows.

In 2005, Gosling volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi in the clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina. He is a supporter of Invisible Children, Inc., a group that raises awareness about the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA) in Central Africa. In 2005, he traveled to Darfur refugee camps in Chad. He was a speaker at Campus Progress&#x27; National Conference in 2008, where he discussed Darfur. As part of his work with the Enough Project, he visited Uganda in 2007 and eastern Congo in 2010.

==Accolades==

Among his many accolades, Gosling has received three Academy Award nominations, two British Academy Film Award nominations, one Golden Globe Award from six nominations, and six Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.

In 2006, his role as a troubled history teacher in the drama film &quot;Half Nelson&quot; gained him nominations for an Academy Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor. He received nominations for an Academy Award, British Academy Film Award, Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016) and &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023) in the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories respectively, winning a Golden Globe Award for the former. His performances in &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot; (2007), &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; (2010), &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, and &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot; (both 2011); also earned him Golden Globe nominations.

<text>The  is a historic theatre in Vienna located on the Left Wienzeile in the Mariahilf district. Completed in 1801, the theatre has hosted the premieres of many celebrated works of theatre, opera, and symphonic music. Since 2006, it has served primarily as an opera house, hosting its own company.

Although &quot;&quot; is German for &quot;Vienna&quot;, the &quot; in the name of the theatre is actually the name of the Wien River, which once flowed by the theatre site; &quot; means &quot;on the banks of the Wien&quot;. In modern times, the river has been covered over in this location and the covered riverbed now houses the Naschmarkt, an open-air market.

The theatre is operated in cooperation with Vereinigte Bühnen Wien (VBW) which also operates the Raimund Theater and the Ronacher.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

The theatre was the brainchild of the Viennese theatrical impresario Emanuel Schikaneder, who is best known as Mozart&#x27;s librettist and collaborator on the opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1791). Schikaneder&#x27;s troupe had already been successfully performing for several years in Vienna in the smaller and this is where &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; had premiered. As the troupe&#x27;s performances often emphasized spectacle and scenery, the librettist felt ready to move to a larger and better equipped venue.

He had already been granted an imperial licence to build a new theatre in 1786, but it was only in 1798 that he felt ready to act on this authorization. The building was designed by the architect Franz Jäger in Empire style (it has since been remodeled). Construction was completed in 1801. The theatre has been described as &quot;the most lavishly equipped and one of the largest theatres of its age&quot;.
The theatre opened on 13 June 1801 with a prologue written by Schikaneder followed by a performance of the opera &quot;Alexander&quot; by Franz Teyber. The new theatre proved to be a sensation. Adolf Bäurle, a local critic, wrote &quot;if Schikaneder and [his partner] Zitterbarth had had the idea ... to charge admission simply for looking at the glories of their , Schikaneder would certainly have been able to take in vast sums of money without giving one single performance.&quot; The &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; called it the &quot;most comfortable and satisfactory in the whole of Germany&quot; (which meant at the time, &quot;all German-speaking lands&quot;).

In 1807 the theatre was acquired by a group of court nobles that included Count Ferdinand Palffy von Erdöd, who bought it outright in 1813. During the period of his proprietorship, which lasted until 1826, he offered opera and ballet and, to appeal to a wider Viennese audience, popular pantomime and variety acts, losing money in elaborate spectacles until finally he was forced to sell the theatre at auction in 1826.

Only a part of the original building is preserved: the &quot;&quot; (Papageno Gate) is a memorial to Schikaneder, who is depicted playing the role of Papageno in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, a role he wrote for himself to perform. He is accompanied by the Three Boys, characters in the same opera.

From 1889 to 1905, Alexandrine von Schönerer was managing director after the lease ended in 1884 between her and the librettist Camillo Walzel.

In the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the theatre experienced a golden age during the flourishing of Viennese operetta, as referenced in the list below.

=== Later history ===

From 1945 to 1955, it was one of the temporary homes of the Vienna State Opera, whose own building had been destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. However, in 1955, the theatre was closed for safety reasons. It languished unused for several years, and by the early 1960s, the threat had emerged that it would be converted to a parking garage. (This was the same era of &quot;urban renewal&quot; that in America nearly destroyed Carnegie Hall).

By 1962 the theatre had a new and successful role as a venue for contemporary musical theatre. Many English-language musicals had their German premieres there. In 1992, the musical &quot;Elisabeth&quot; (about Franz Joseph I of Austria&#x27;s wife, Elisabeth of Bavaria, also known as Sisi), premiered there and ran for six consecutive years until 1998; Elisabeth went on to become the most successful German-language musical to date, returning to the Theater an der Wien for a revival production from 2003 to 2005. The musical &quot;Cats&quot; directed and choreographed by Gillian Lynne played successfully for seven years.
Despite its focus on operettas and musicals, the theatre still served as a venue for occasional opera productions, especially during the Vienna Festival seasons, and sometimes co-produced with the Vienna State Opera. Notable productions of the non-standard repertory include:
* Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; (1962), conducted by Karl Böhm, staged by Otto Schenk, designed by Caspar Neher, and starring Evelyn Lear
* Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (1967), conducted by Richard Bonynge, staged by Rudolf Hartmann, and starring Nicolai Gedda and Joan Sutherland
* Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; (1971), conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and staged by Federik Mirdita
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (1976), conducted by Julius Rudel, staged by Mirdita, and starring Werner Hollweg, Teresa Berganza, Arleen Auger, and Edda Moser
* Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Fierrabras&quot; (1988), conducted by Claudio Abbado, staged by Ruth Berghaus, and starring Thomas Hampson, Karita Mattila, and László Polgár
* The world premiere of Adriana Hölszky&#x27;s &quot;Die Wände&quot; (1995), conducted by Ulf Schirmer, and staged by Hans Neuenfels
Between 1996 and 2002, Riccardo Muti conducted new productions of the three Da Ponte operas of Mozart, based on an original production by Giorgio Strehler.

=== Today ===
In 2006, the 250th anniversary year of Mozart&#x27;s birth, the presented a series of major Mozart operas, thus initiating its conversion to a full-time venue for opera and other forms of classical music under the direction of . Major musical productions since are now presented at either the Raimund Theater or the Ronacher. The first opera to be given was Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; with Neil Shicoff in the title role and Peter Schneider conducting the new production by Willy Decker. Other members of the cast were Angelika Kirchschlager, Genia Kühmeier, and Barbara Frittoli.

Geyer is quoted as saying that he wishes to &quot;present cutting edge directors and interesting productions&quot;, and his three main areas of focus are on Baroque opera, contemporary opera, and Mozart.

In recent years, the theatre&#x27;s seasons have included the following works outside the standard repertoire:
*Ian Bell: &quot;The Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot; with Diana Damrau in the title role.

<text>Lochcarron () is a village, community and civil parish in the Wester Ross area of Highland, Scotland. It has a population of 923.

==Locality==
The name Lochcarron is also applied to the collection of small settlements strung out along Loch Carron, a sea loch on the west coast of Ross and Cromarty. The village stretches for almost , meandering along the shore of the loch. It means &quot;Loch of rough water&quot;. In the 19th Century the village was named Janetown, then Jeantown. The local newspaper, &quot;An Carrannach&quot;, is published on a monthly basis.

Lochcarron is a central location for hillwalking and touring the West Coast Highlands, including the Torridon, Plockton and Skye regions. Close to the village lies the Bealach na Bà road (Gaelic: &quot;Pass of the cattle&quot;), which links Applecross to the rest of the mainland. It is a road popular with tourists, drivers, and motorcyclists alike for its scenery and hairpin bends.

==Amenities==
Lochcarron contains a variety of local services. These include two petrol stations, a Spar shop (which has a Post Office counter), a library, a nursing home (attached to which is the local library), medical centre and tartan weaving heritage shop.

There are also two hotels (offering entertainment and meals), a restaurant and two cafés. The community hall hosts a number of public events including ceilidhs and sales; and sports such as indoor bowls and short tennis.

There are a number of self catering and bed and breakfast establishments, many of which are members of the local business association.

==Education==
The local primary school stands at the entrance to the village, with 43 pupils (as of December 2019). The primary school offers both English and Gaelic Medium education. Plockton High School is the nearest secondary school to Lochcarron.

==Employment==
The area&#x27;s biggest employment sectors include tourism, crofting, and fish farming. Other employers include transportation via sea and road, and quarry work. Service industries include engineering, motor garages, health services and education. The Howard Doris Centre employs people in the care sector.

==Sport and recreation==
Sailing is a popular activity amongst the local and visiting population, and as such, a local RYA accredited, and Volvo Championship Club hosts free sailing sessions every Wednesday evening (between April and October), and racing sessions every Sunday afternoon. It currently enlists over 100 members.

Lochcarron is home to the local shinty team Lochcarron Camanachd. The team currently play their home games at Battery Park in the west end of the village. The playing field is used during the week for training, and knockabout sessions.

There is a 9-hole course in the area which is over 150 years old. The golf club&#x27;s clubhouse offers catering facilities and golf clubs available to hire.

The nearby Attadale hosts an annual Highland Games every third Saturday of July.

<doc id="891240" wikidata="Q5035982" url="?curid=891240" title="Capitulation after the Warsaw Uprising">
<text>The Warsaw Uprising of 1944 was ended through a capitulation agreement which guaranteed not only the rights of the resistance to be treated as prisoners of war but also was designed to guarantee the fair treatment of the civilians living in Warsaw. This agreement, between General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski and SS General Erich von dem Bach, had taken a long period of on-and-off negotiations to achieve.

==Signing of the capitulation treaty==
On October 3, General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski signed the capitulation of the remaining Polish forces (&quot;Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej&quot; or Home Army Warsaw Corps) in the German headquarters in the presence of General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski. According to the capitulation treaty, the Home Army soldiers were to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the civilian population was to be treated humanely.

The next day the Germans began to disarm the Home Army soldiers. Most of them were later sent to POW camps in various parts of Germany. At the same time the civilian population (approximately 700,000) was resettled to concentration camps west of Warsaw. Many soldiers, fearing German atrocities in captivity, chose to blend into the civilian population, escape Warsaw among them and continue the fight later.

==Reasons for failure==

There are several factors responsible for the failure, although there is no consensus about all of them nor their relative importance.

One of the main reasons for the collapse of the uprising was the lack of support from the Soviet Red Army. Soviet assistance to the Home Army on the eastern territories was limited to small collaboration on a tactical level at best, with common incidents of shooting or imprisoning of Home Army soldiers after the area was seized by Soviets. During the Warsaw Uprising the Red Army stood on the other bank of the Vistula River and only elements from the Polish 1 Armia Wojska Polskiego attempted to make a crossing and received artillery support. The Soviet High Command did not allow pilots from the RAF and the Polish Air-forces to use Soviet landing strips. After the initial radio and leaflet propaganda campaign, the Moscow-backed Wanda radio station remained silent until the very end of fighting. It has been argued that the Soviets deliberately allowed the Germans to defeat the Home Army in order to eliminate a force in Poland which would oppose the communist puppet government the Soviets planned to install in Poland. This is consistent with later Soviet treatment of many Home Army soldiers, who were usually imprisoned, tortured, and executed.

::&quot;See Operation Tempest for aftermath of other actions of that operation&quot;

The decision to begin the Uprising can be viewed more as a political one (a demonstration to show the Soviets and the Western Allies that the Polish government-in-exile had control over the country) than a military one (since the military situation was worsening, as German troops in Warsaw were being strengthened and reinforced). The decision to start the Uprising was rushed several times: first on 20 July, when plans for Operation Tempest were changed to include Warsaw (after the series of reports on aggressive actions by Soviets toward Home Army units in the eastern territories), then on 31 July when exaggerated reports of approaching Russian forces convinced some decision makers that if they did not start the Uprising soon it would be too late to aid the Russians and &#x27;make a stand&#x27;. Due to this rushed change of plans, personnel and ammunition available at the time of &quot;W-hour&quot; in Warsaw were not optimal.

==Fate of the Warsaw civilians==

Most civilians were not killed and many were released into the country west of Warsaw, but some were sent to concentration camps or subjected to slave labour.

The entire civilian population of Warsaw was expelled from the city and sent to a transit camp &quot;Durchgangslager&quot; 121 in Pruszków. Out of 350,000–550,000 civilians who passed through the camp, 90,000 were sent to labour camps in the Third Reich, 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps (including Ravensbrück, Auschwitz, and Mauthausen, among others), while the rest were transported to various locations in the General Government and released.

==Fate of the fighters==

Most of the resistance fighters were sent to POW camps in various parts of Germany. Depending on where they were sent, the ones that were still alive were later liberated by U.S., British or Soviet forces.

<doc id="891254" wikidata="Q3066039" url="?curid=891254" title="Duc de Dalberg">
<text>The title of Duc de Dalberg was created by the French Emperor Napoleon I on 14 April 1810 for Emmerich von Dalberg, the nephew of Karl Theodor von Dalberg, Prince-Primate of the Confederation of the Rhine and Grand Duke of Frankfurt. He died on 27 April 1833. His daughter, Marie Louise von Dalberg (1813–1860), and heiress married firstly Sir Richard Acton, 7th Baronet (by whom she was the mother of John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton) and secondly Granville George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, but as the Duke had no sons, the title became extinct.

==Tascher de La Pagerie==
However, by decree of the Emperor Napoleon III, 2 March 1859, the extinct Dalberg dukedom was revived and extended to the Emmerich de Dalberg&#x27;s first cousin twice removed, Charles de Tascher de La Pagerie (who was also a second cousin once removed of Napoleon III), and redesignated as Duc de Tascher de La Pagerie. 

Tascher family is an old French noble family of landed gentry, tracing back their lineage to 1455, that originated in Châteauneuf-en-Thymerais, Perche, France. The title became extinct again at the death of Charles&#x27;s son Louis Robert in 1902, though the senior branch of the Tascher de La Pagerie family (who were unrelated to the 1st Duc de Dalberg, but distant relatives of Duke Louis Robert (1840-1902) and Empress Josephine de Beauharnais) later illegally assumed the ducal title.

==Ducs de Dalberg, later de Tascher de La Pagerie (1810)==
*Emmerich Joseph Franz Heinrich Felix Dismas Kämmerer von Worms gt. von Dalberg, 1st Duc de Dalberg (1773-1833)
*Charles Joseph Louis Robert Philippe de Tascher de La Pagerie, 2nd Duc de Tascher de La Pagerie (1811-1869)

<doc id="891255" wikidata="Q3978062" url="?curid=891255" title="Supermanifold">
<text>In physics and mathematics, supermanifolds are generalizations of the manifold concept based on ideas coming from supersymmetry. Several definitions are in use, some of which are described below.

== Informal definition ==
An informal definition is commonly used in physics textbooks and introductory lectures. It defines a supermanifold as a manifold with both bosonic and fermionic coordinates. Locally, it is composed of coordinate charts that make it look like a &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;Euclidean&quot; superspace. These local coordinates are often denoted by

:formula_1

where &quot;x&quot; is the (real-number-valued) spacetime coordinate, and formula_2 and formula_3 are Grassmann-valued spatial &quot;directions&quot;.

The physical interpretation of the Grassmann-valued coordinates are the subject of debate; explicit experimental searches for supersymmetry have not yielded any positive results. However, the use of Grassmann variables allow for the tremendous simplification of a number of important mathematical results. This includes, among other things a compact definition of functional integrals, the proper treatment of ghosts in BRST quantization, the cancellation of infinities in quantum field theory, Witten&#x27;s work on the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and more recent applications to mirror symmetry.

The use of Grassmann-valued coordinates has spawned the field of supermathematics, wherein large portions of geometry can be generalized to super-equivalents, including much of Riemannian geometry and most of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras (such as Lie superalgebras, &quot;etc.&quot;) However, issues remain, including the proper extension of de Rham cohomology to supermanifolds.

== Definition ==
Three different definitions of supermanifolds are in use. One definition is as a sheaf over a ringed space; this is sometimes called the &quot;algebro-geometric approach&quot;. This approach has a mathematical elegance, but can be problematic in various calculations and intuitive understanding. A second approach can be called a &quot;concrete approach&quot;, as it is capable of simply and naturally generalizing a broad class of concepts from ordinary mathematics. It requires the use of an infinite number of supersymmetric generators in its definition; however, all but a finite number of these generators carry no content, as the concrete approach requires the use of a coarse topology that renders almost all of them equivalent. Surprisingly, these two definitions, one with a finite number of supersymmetric generators, and one with an infinite number of generators, are equivalent.

A third approach describes a supermanifold as a base topos of a superpoint. This approach remains the topic of active research.

===Algebro-geometric: as a sheaf===
Although supermanifolds are special cases of noncommutative manifolds, their local structure makes them better suited to study with the tools of standard differential geometry and locally ringed spaces.

A supermanifold M of dimension (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) is a topological space &quot;M&quot; with a sheaf of superalgebras, usually denoted &quot;OM&quot; or C∞(M), that is locally isomorphic to formula_4, where the latter is a Grassmann (Exterior) algebra on &quot;q&quot; generators.

A supermanifold M of dimension (1,1) is sometimes called a super-Riemann surface.

Historically, this approach is associated with Felix Berezin, Dimitry Leites, and Bertram Kostant.

===Concrete: as a smooth manifold===
A different definition describes a supermanifold in a fashion that is similar to that of a smooth manifold, except that the model space formula_5 has been replaced by the &quot;model superspace&quot; formula_6.

To correctly define this, it is necessary to explain what formula_7 and formula_8 are. These are given as the even and odd real subspaces of the one-dimensional space of Grassmann numbers, which, by convention, are generated by a countably infinite number of anti-commuting variables: i.e. the one-dimensional space is given by formula_9 where &quot;V&quot; is infinite-dimensional. An element &quot;z&quot; is termed &quot;real&quot; if formula_10; real elements consisting of only an even number of Grassmann generators form the space formula_7 of &quot;c-numbers&quot;, while real elements consisting of only an odd number of Grassmann generators form the space formula_8 of &quot;a-numbers&quot;. Note that &quot;c&quot;-numbers commute, while &quot;a&quot;-numbers anti-commute. The spaces formula_13 and formula_14 are then defined as the &quot;p&quot;-fold and &quot;q&quot;-fold Cartesian products of formula_7 and formula_8.

Just as in the case of an ordinary manifold, the supermanifold is then defined as a collection of charts glued together with differentiable transition functions. This definition in terms of charts requires that the transition functions have a smooth structure and a non-vanishing Jacobian. This can only be accomplished if the individual charts use a topology that is considerably coarser than the vector-space topology on the Grassmann algebra. This topology is obtained by projecting formula_13 down to formula_5 and then using the natural topology on that. The resulting topology is &quot;not&quot; Hausdorff, but may be termed &quot;projectively Hausdorff&quot;.

That this definition is equivalent to the first one is not at all obvious; however, it is the use of the coarse topology that makes it so, by rendering most of the &quot;points&quot; identical. That is, formula_6 with the coarse topology is essentially isomorphic to formula_20

== Properties ==

Unlike a regular manifold, a supermanifold is not entirely composed of a set of points. Instead, one takes the dual point of view that the structure of a supermanifold M is contained in its sheaf &quot;OM&quot; of &quot;smooth functions&quot;. In the dual point of view, an injective map corresponds to a surjection of sheaves, and a surjective map corresponds to an injection of sheaves.

An alternative approach to the dual point of view is to use the functor of points.

If M is a supermanifold of dimension (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;), then the underlying space &quot;M&quot; inherits the structure of a differentiable manifold whose sheaf of smooth functions is formula_21, where formula_22 is the ideal generated by all odd functions. Thus &quot;M&quot; is called the underlying space, or the body, of M. The quotient map formula_23 corresponds to an injective map &quot;M&quot; → M; thus &quot;M&quot; is a submanifold of M.

== Examples ==

* Let &quot;M&quot; be a manifold. The &quot;odd tangent bundle&quot; ΠT&quot;M&quot; is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Ω(&quot;M&quot;) of differential forms on &quot;M&quot;.
* More generally, let &quot;E&quot; → &quot;M&quot; be a vector bundle. Then Π&quot;E&quot; is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Γ(ΛE*). In fact, Π is a functor from the category of vector bundles to the category of supermanifolds.
* Lie supergroups are examples of supermanifolds.

==Batchelor&#x27;s theorem==

Batchelor&#x27;s theorem states that every supermanifold is noncanonically isomorphic to a supermanifold of the form Π&quot;E&quot;. The word &quot;noncanonically&quot; prevents one from concluding that supermanifolds are simply glorified vector bundles; although the functor Π maps surjectively onto the isomorphism classes of supermanifolds, it is not an equivalence of categories. It was published by Marjorie Batchelor in 1979.

The proof of Batchelor&#x27;s theorem relies in an essential way on the existence of a partition of unity, so it does not hold for complex or real-analytic supermanifolds.

== Odd symplectic structures ==

=== Odd symplectic form ===

In many physical and geometric applications, a supermanifold comes equipped with an Grassmann-odd symplectic structure. All natural geometric objects on a supermanifold are graded. In particular, the bundle of two-forms is equipped with a grading. An odd symplectic form ω on a supermanifold is a closed, odd form, inducing a non-degenerate pairing on &quot;TM&quot;. Such a supermanifold is called a P-manifold. Its graded dimension is necessarily (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot;), because the odd symplectic form induces a pairing of odd and even variables. There is a version of the Darboux theorem for P-manifolds, which allows one
to equip a P-manifold locally with a set of coordinates where the odd symplectic form ω is written as 
:formula_24
where formula_25 are even coordinates, and formula_26 odd coordinates. (An odd symplectic form should not be confused with a Grassmann-even symplectic form on a supermanifold. In contrast, the Darboux version of an even symplectic form is
:formula_27
where formula_28 are even coordinates, formula_26 odd coordinates and formula_30 are either +1 or −1.)

===Antibracket===
Given an odd symplectic 2-form ω one may define a Poisson bracket known as the antibracket of any two functions &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; on a supermanifold by

::formula_31

Here formula_32 and formula_33 are the right and left derivatives respectively and &quot;z&quot; are the coordinates of the supermanifold. Equipped with this bracket, the algebra of functions on a supermanifold becomes an antibracket algebra.

A coordinate transformation that preserves the antibracket is called a P-transformation. If the Berezinian of a P-transformation is equal to one then it is called an SP-transformation.

===P and SP-manifolds===

Using the Darboux theorem for odd symplectic forms one can show that P-manifolds are constructed from open sets of superspaces formula_34 glued together by P-transformations. A manifold is said to be an SP-manifold if these transition functions can be chosen to be SP-transformations. Equivalently one may define an SP-manifold as a supermanifold with a nondegenerate odd 2-form ω and a density function ρ such that on each coordinate patch there exist Darboux coordinates in which ρ is identically equal to one.

===Laplacian===
One may define a Laplacian operator Δ on an SP-manifold as the operator which takes a function &quot;H&quot; to one half of the divergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. Explicitly one defines

:::formula_35

In Darboux coordinates this definition reduces to
::::formula_36

where &quot;x&quot;&quot;a&quot; and &quot;θ&quot;&quot;a&quot; are even and odd coordinates such that

::::formula_37

The Laplacian is odd and nilpotent

::::formula_38

One may define the cohomology of functions &quot;H&quot; with respect to the Laplacian. In Geometry of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization, Albert Schwarz has proven that the integral of a function &quot;H&quot; over a Lagrangian submanifold &quot;L&quot; depends only on the cohomology class of &quot;H&quot; and on the homology class of the body of &quot;L&quot; in the body of the ambient supermanifold.

== SUSY ==

A pre-SUSY-structure on a supermanifold of dimension
(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) is an odd &quot;m&quot;-dimensional
distribution formula_39.
With such a distribution one associates
its Frobenius tensor formula_40
(since &quot;P&quot; is odd, the skew-symmetric Frobenius
tensor is a symmetric operation).
If this tensor is non-degenerate,
e.g. lies in an open orbit of 
formula_41,
&quot;M&quot; is called &quot;a SUSY-manifold&quot;.
SUSY-structure in dimension (1, &quot;k&quot;)
is the same as odd contact structure.
