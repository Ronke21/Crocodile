<text>The 89th Infantry Division, originally known as the &quot;89th Division,&quot; was an infantry formation of the United States Army that was active during World War I, World War II, and the Cold War.

== History ==
===World War I===

The 89th Division was officially established by the War Department on 5 August 1917, four months after the American entry into World War I, at Camp Funston, Fort Riley, Kansas. On 27 August, Major General Leonard Wood, formerly the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, assumed command. Organization of the division began during the last week of August, with a cadre of officers and men of the Regular Army, and from officers of the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps and National Army officer graduates of the First Officers Training Camp held at Fort Riley. From September 5-10, the initial draft of 2,200 Selective Service men arrived, and from Sept 19-24, an additional 18,600 arrived. The drafted men came from Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, and South Dakota. 

The 353rd Infantry was organized with men from Kansas, the 354th Infantry with men from southeastern and eastern Missouri, the 355th Infantry with men from Nebraska, and the 356th Infantry with men from northwest Missouri. The 340th Machine Gun Battalion was organized with men from South Dakota, the 341st Machine Gun Battalion principally from men living in the Omaha, Nebraska, area, and the 342nd Machine Gun Battalion got men from Arizona, Colorado, and South Dakota. The 340th Field Artillery was sent men from Arizona, the 341st Field Artillery from Colorado, and the 342nd Field Artillery from southeast Missouri. The 314th Engineer Regiment received men from southeastern and eastern Missouri that were surplus after the organization of the 354th Infantry. The 314th Field Signal Battalion was organized using men of the Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps called to active duty. They were principally from the Chicago area, but the unit also &quot;contained representatives of almost every state;&quot; Company A, the radio company, was made up principally of reservists who worked for the Western Electric Company. Men from Nebraska comprised the 314th Ammunition Train, while the 314th Engineer, Sanitary, and Supply Trains received men from each state sent to Camp Funston.

Systematic training began. Between January and June 1918, arrivals and departures at Camp Funston aggregated 20,000 each, and on April 30, the 89th Division numbered 16,000 men, having been reduced by transfers to the 3rd, 4th, 35th, and other divisions. In May, fresh drafts and transfers completed the division.

The division, now commanded by Major General William M. Wright, was sent overseas in June and July 1918 to join the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in the final stages of World War I, which ended on November 11, 1918, due to the Armistice with Germany. The 89th Division, now under Major General Frank L. Winn, participated in the Battle of St. Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Two 89th staff officers would serve together in significant roles in WWII: Division Chief of Staff Col. John C.H. Lee, and his G-4 (supply officer), Lt. Col. Brehon B. Somervell, who also received the Distinguished Service Cross for leading a three-man patrol to inspect damage to a bridge some 600 yards (550 m) in front of American lines. Lee would serve under Somervell in the Army Service Forces from 1942 to 1945.

===Between the wars===
The division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Seventh Corps Area, and assigned to the XVII Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota. The headquarters was organized on 2 September 1921 at the Army Building at 15th and Dodge Streets in Omaha, Nebraska. It moved in April 1922 to 22nd and Hickory Streets, and to the new Federal Office Building at 106 South 15th Street on 18 January 1934, where it remained until the division was ordered into active military service for World War II. The designated mobilization station for the division during this period was Fort Riley, Kansas. After its reorganization, the division formed rapidly and by November 1922, the “Middle West Division” was up to 95 percent strength in its complement of officers as required by its peacetime tables of organization. 

The headquarters and staff usually trained with the staff of the 14th Infantry Brigade, 7th Division, either at Fort Crook, Nebraska, or at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the 17th Infantry Regiment at Fort Crook, or Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Sixth and Seventh Corps Areas, often with the active units of the 7th Division. For example, the division’s artillery trained at various posts to include Fort Riley, Fort Des Moines, Iowa, and Camp McCoy, Wisconsin, with the 9th and 14th Field Artillery Regiments; the 314th Engineer Regiment trained at Fort Riley, with Troop A, 9th Engineer Squadron; the 314th Medical Regiment trained at the Medical Corps training camp at Fort Snelling; and the 314th Observation Squadron trained with the 16th Observation Squadron at Marshall Army Airfield, Kansas. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Fort Crook, Fort Des Moines, and Fort Leavenworth each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Seventh Corps Area and Fourth Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. Unlike the Regular and Guard units, however, the 89th Division did not participate in the various Seventh Corps Area maneuvers and the Fourth Army maneuvers of 1937, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

===World War II===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 89th Infantry Division landed in France at Le Havre, 21 January 1945, and engaged in several weeks of precombat training before moving up to the Sauer River into jump-off positions east of Echternach, 11 March 1945. The next day, the offensive began, and the 89th plunged across the Sauer in a rapid advance to and across the Moselle, 17 March. The offensive rolled on, and the division assaulted across the Rhine River on 26 March 1945 under intense fire in the Wellmich-Oberwesel region. A pontoon bridge was built across the Rhine from St. Goar to St. Goarshausen. In April, the 89th attacked toward Eisenach, taking that town on 6 April. The next objective, Friedrichroda, was secured by 8 April. On 4 April 1945, the 89th overran Ohrdruf, a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp. The division continued to move eastward toward the Mulde River, capturing Zwickau by 17 April. The advance was halted, 23 April, and from then until VE-day, the division saw only limited action, engaging in patrolling and general security. Three towns, Lößnitz, Aue, and Stollberg, were kept under constant pressure, but no attacks were launched.

===Postwar===
The 89th was reactivated as a Reserve unit in 1947 with headquarters in Wichita, Kansas and redesignated as the 89th Division (Training) in 1959. In 1973 the division colors were cased and the shoulder patch (but not the lineage and honors) was continued in use as the 89th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM); ARCOMs were not tactical commands, but were instead regional conglomerations of unrelated units. Upon mobilization, units within the ARCOMs would be assigned to active duty units with which they were aligned. The 89th ARCOM was later redesignated as the 89th Regional Support Command, and in 2003 it became the 89th Regional Readiness Command. In its 2005 BRAC recommendations, United States Department of Defense recommended realigning the Wichita U.S. Army Reserve Center by disestablishing the 89th Regional Readiness Command. This recommendation was part of a larger recommendation to reengineer and streamline the command and control structure of the Army Reserve that would create the Northwest Regional Readiness Command at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. The 89th currently exists as the 89th Sustainment Brigade in the Reserve.

<text>The 84th Training Command (&quot;Railsplitters&quot;) is a formation of the United States Army. During World War I it was designated the 84th Division, American Expeditionary Forces; during World War II it was known as the 84th Infantry [[Division (military)|Division]]. From 1946 to 1952, the division was a part of the United States Army Reserve as the 84th Airborne Division. In 1959, the division was reorganized and redesignated once more as the 84th Division. The division was headquartered in Milwaukee in command of over 4,100 soldiers divided into eight brigades—including an ROTC brigade—spread throughout seven states.

Changes to the U.S. Army Reserve organizations from 2005 until 2007 redesigned the unit as the 84th Training Command (Leader Readiness) and it was paired with the Army Reserve Readiness Training Center (ARRTC). The flag resided at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. As a result of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) throughout the Army, the ARRTC was moved to Fort Knox, Kentucky. The 84th Training Command (LR) underwent a command-directed move to Fort Knox, Kentucky in advance of the ARRTC in September 2008. Since the move, the 84th Training Command and ARRTC split, leaving the ARRTC with leader readiness and training support. The 84th Training Command was re-designated once again to 84th Training Command (Unit Readiness).

In September 2010, the 84th was renamed 84th Training Command and began reorganization. The 84th mission currently supports three numbered and three named training divisions – The 78th Training Division (Ft. Dix, NJ), the 86th Training Division (Ft. McCoy, WI), and the 91st Training Division (Ft. Hunter Liggett, CA), Atlantic Training Division (Ft. Dix, NJ), Great Lakes Training Division (Arlington Heights, IL), Pacific Training Division (Camp Parks, Dublin, CA)

Tradition has it that the division traces its lineage to the Illinois militia company in which a young Captain Abraham Lincoln served during the Black Hawk War of 1832. The division patch was selected to honor this legacy and the division&#x27;s origin in Illinois. For this reason, the alternative nickname of &quot;Lincoln County&quot; Division&quot; has been used to denote the 84th.

==World War I==
The division was activated in September 1917 at Camp Taylor, Kentucky. It was initially made up of enlisted draftees from Indiana and Kentucky (who chose the formation&#x27;s distinctive patch and nickname, an allusion to Abraham Lincoln who grew up in those two states), with a cadre of Regular Army, Officers Reserve Corps, and National Army officers. Later groups of enlisted men assigned to the division to replace men transferred to other units came from Ohio, North Dakota, and Montana. The division remained in training at Camp Taylor until August 1918. It was deployed to France in October 1918 to serve as a training formation for replacements which would be sent to the Western Front. At the war&#x27;s end, the formation was recalled home and, without having seen combat actions, inactivated in January 1919.

Its commanders included Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (25 August 1917), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (6 October 1917), Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (26 November 1917), Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (15 December 1917), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (1 March 1918), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (5 June 1918), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (21 July 1918), Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (18 October 1918), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (31 October 1918).

==Interwar period==

The 84th Division headquarters arrived at the Port of Hoboken, New Jersey, aboard the USS Wilhelmina on 19 January 1919 after four months of overseas service and was demobilized on 26 July 1919 at Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky. It was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Fifth Corps Area, and assigned to the XV Corps. The division was further allotted to Indiana as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 6 September 1921 at room 408 in the Federal Building in Indianapolis. The headquarters was relocated in August 1922 to 24 East Michigan Street and moved again in 1928 to the Meridian Life Building. The headquarters was moved twice more before World War II: first to the Chamber of Commerce Building in 1933; and finally back to the Federal Building in 1937. It remained there until activated for World War II.

Though the designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Knox, Kentucky, and some of the division&#x27;s training occurred there, much of the training activities for the division headquarters and its subordinate units transpired in other locations as well. For example, the headquarters occasionally trained with the staff of the 10th Infantry Brigade, 5th Division, at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. The infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 10th Infantry Brigade at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, or Fort Benjamin Harrison, but some years they went to Camp Knox. For some years, the 167th and 168th Infantry Brigades and their subordinate units conducted camp at the Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster trained at various posts in the Fifth Corps Area, usually with similar active units of the 5th Division. For example, the division&#x27;s artillery trained with the 5th Division artillery units stationed at Camp Knox; the 309th Engineer Regiment usually trained at Fort Benjamin Harrison; the 309th Medical Regiment trained at Camp Knox; and the 309th Observation Squadron trained with the 88th Observation Squadron at Wright Field, Ohio. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility for conducting the infantry Citizens Military Training Camps held at Fort Thomas and Camp Knox each year.

On a number of occasions, the division participated in various Fifth Corps Area or Second Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the First Corps Area, the 84th Division did not participate in the Fifth Corps Area maneuvers and the Second Army maneuvers of 1936, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

==World War II==

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 84th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 15 October 1942, at Camp Howze, Texas, about 60 miles north of Dallas. It embarked on 20 September 1944 and arrived in the United Kingdom on 1 October, for additional training. The division landed on Omaha Beach, 1–4 November 1944, and moved to the vicinity of Gulpen, the Netherlands, 5–12 November.

The division entered combat on 18 November with an attack on Geilenkirchen, Germany, (Operation Clipper) as part of the larger offensive in the Roer Valley, north of Aachen. Operating under the command of Lt-Gen Brian Horrocks the division was supported by British tanks of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, specialist armoured units of 79th Armoured Division, and XXX Corps&#x27; artillery. Taking Geilenkirchen on 19 November, the division pushed forward to take Beeck (Geilenkirchen) and Lindern (Geilenkirchen) in the face of heavy enemy resistance, 29 November. After a short rest, the division returned to the fight, taking Wurm and Würm (Geilenkirchen), Mullendorf, 18 December, before moving to Belgium to help stem the German winter offensive (Battle of the Bulge).

Battling in snow, sleet, and rain, the division threw off German attacks, recaptured Verdenne, 24–28 December, took Beffe and Devantave (Rendeux), 4–6 January 1945, and seized La Roche, 11 January. By 16 January, the Bulge had been reduced. After a 5-day respite, the 84th resumed the offensive, taking Gouvy and Beho. On 7 February, the division assumed responsibility for the Roer River zone, between Linnich and Himmerich (near Heinsberg), and trained for the river crossing.

On 23 February 1945, the first day of Operation Grenade, the division cut across the Roer, took Boisheim and Dülken, 1 March, crossed the Niers on 2 March, took Krefeld, 3 March, and reached the Rhine by 5 March. One day before, the &#x27;Krefeld-Uerdinger Brücke&#x27; was blown off by Wehrmacht soldiers.
The division trained along the west bank of the river in March.

After crossing the Rhine, 1 April, the division drove from Lembeck toward Bielefeld in conjunction with the 5th Armored Division, crossing the Weser River to capture Hanover, 10 April. By 13 April, it had reached the Elbe, and halted its advance, patrolling along the river. Soviet troops were contacted at Balow, 2 May 1945. The division remained on occupation duty in Germany after VE-day, returning to the United States on 19 January 1946 for demobilization. It was redesignated a reserve formation on 21 January 1946.

Troops of the 84th Infantry Division liberated two satellite camps of the Neuengamme Concentration Camp: Ahlem (a.k.a. Hannover-Ahlem), on 10 April 1945, and Salzwedel, on 14 April 1945. As such, the 84th is officially recognized as a &quot;Liberating Unit&quot; by both the U.S. Army&#x27;s Center of Military History and the Holocaust Memorial Museum.

==Cold War to present==
Following the conclusion of World War II, the division was made part of the Army Reserve. In January 1946, it was redesignated the 84th Airborne Division and headquartered out of Wisconsin. In 1947, it was designated as the Army&#x27;s Airborne Reserve Command. Five years later, in 1952, the division was reorganized again, this time as a training division composed of three regiments—the 274th, 334th, and 339th. Throughout the 1950s, the division would continue its conversion to a training formation, changing its subordinate unit makeup from regiments to brigades and support groups.

On 24 January 1991, elements of the 84th Division (Training) were activated and mobilized for support roles in Operation Desert Storm. Less than three months later, on 22 March 1991, the elements were returned home. In 1993, reorganization within the Army Reserve brought about the merger between the 84th and the 85th Division (Training). The move expanded the 84th Division&#x27;s area of command to include the rest of Wisconsin and Illinois, as well as all of Missouri and Iowa. Soon after, in June 1994, units from the 84th participated in peacekeeping operations as part of the multinational observer force in the Sinai, Egypt, and remained there until July 1995.

In April 1995, the formation was once more redesignated, this time as an institutional training division. This change brought with it command of units and training in the state of Nebraska. In August 1995, army reorganization further expanded the 84th&#x27;s range of authority to command the fourteen U.S. Army Reserve Forces Schools in Region E—Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.

In October 2004, the 84th Division (Institutional Training) underwent a major transformation. All eight brigades realigned under the 100th Division and the Headquarters and Division Band combined with the Army Reserve Readiness Training Center (ARRTC) located at Fort McCoy, Wis., to create the 84th U.S. Army Reserve Readiness Training Command (84th USARRTC). The expertise and resources from the two units gave the 84th USARRTC an edge on the type and amount of training opportunities offered. The three Army Reserve NCO academies were also realigned under the new 84th USARRTC.

In October 2006, the 84th USARRTC underwent another major transformation as 12 brigades from the Army Reserve&#x27;s Institutional Training Divisions realigned under the command. The brigades were responsible for Officer Education System (OES) training, such as the Combined Arms Exercise (CAX) and Intermediate Level Education (ILE), and Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (SROTC) support to universities across the country.

In February 2007, the 84th USARRTC was renamed the 84th Training Command (Leader Readiness) in response to the unit&#x27;s transformation under the Army Reserve&#x27;s Decision Point 74. The 84th Training Command had exercise command and control over three professional development brigades, one schools brigade, one training development brigade, the 84th Division Band, and eventually the Small Arms Readiness Group.

In September 2008, the 84th Training Command relocated from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin to Fort Knox, Kentucky.

In October 2009, the focus of the 84th Training Command shifted from leader readiness to unit readiness. The Army Reserve Readiness Training Center and the three U.S. Army Reserve NCO Academies moved from the umbrella of the 84th and became the 83rd USARRTC which reported directly to the U.S. Army Reserve Command.

In October 2010, the 84th Training Command reorganized to align with the transformation of the Army Reserve. The 84th Training Command is the executing agent of the U.S. Army Reserve&#x27;s Combat Support Training Programs which includes Warrior Exercises (WAREX), Combat Support Training Exercises (CSTX). The 84th Training Command provides multiple collective training opportunities which prepare units for operational deployments worldwide.

<text>Kóoshdaa káa or Kushtaka (lit. &quot;land otter man&quot;) are mythical shape-shifting creatures found in the folklore of the Tlingit peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America.

== Description ==
They are similar to the &#x27;Watsa of the Tsimshian people, Nat&#x27;ina of the Dena&#x27;ina Native Alaskans of South Central Alaska, and the Urayuli of the Yup&#x27;ik in Western Alaska.

Physically, Kóoshdaa káa are shape-shifters capable of assuming human form, the form of an otter and potentially other forms. In some accounts, a Kóoshdaa káa is able to assume the form of any species of otter; in others, only one. Accounts of their behaviour seem to conflict with one another. In some stories, Kóoshdaa káa are cruel creatures who take delight in tricking poor Tlingit sailors to their deaths. In others, they are friendly and helpful, frequently saving the lost from death by freezing. In many stories, the Kóoshdaa káa save the lost individual by distracting them with curiously otter-like illusions of their family and friends as they transform their subject into a fellow Kóoshdaa káa, thus allowing them to survive in the cold. Naturally, this is counted a mixed blessing. However, Kóoshdaa káa legends are not always pleasant. In some legends it is said the Kóoshdaa káa will imitate the cries of a baby or the screams of a woman to lure victims to the river. Once there, the Kóoshdaa káa either kills the person and tears them to shreds or will turn them into another Kóoshdaa káa. 

Legends have it Kóoshdaa káa can be warded off through copper, urine, dogs, and in some stories, fire.

Since the Kóoshdaa káa mainly preys on small children, it has been thought by some that it was used by Tlingit mothers to keep their children from wandering close to the ocean by themselves.

It is also said that the Kóoshda káa emit a high pitched, three part whistle in the pattern of low-high-low.

== In modern literature ==
Kóoshdaa káa appear in Pamela Rae Huteson&#x27;s &quot;Legends in Wood: Stories of the Totems&quot; in the legend &#x27;War with the Land Otter Men&#x27;, as well as Pamela Rae Huteson&#x27;s &quot;Transformation Masks&quot; with the &#x27;Kooshdakhaa Den&#x27;; and Garth Stein&#x27;s &quot;Raven Stole the Moon&quot;. Harry D. Colp describes a miner&#x27;s encounter with the Kóoshdaa káa at Thomas Bay in the short story &quot;The Strangest Story Ever Told.&quot;

It is also the subject of the Alaskan-set horror novel &quot;Kushtaka&quot; by David Pierdomenico. Kóoshdaa káas also appear in William Giraldi&#x27;s novel &quot;Hold the Dark&quot; (2015). The second book of Ann McCaffrey&#x27;s science-fiction The Twins of Petaybee series, &quot;Maelstrom&quot;, features a species of shape-changing deep-sea otter that refer to themselves as Kóoshdaa káa.

The Kóoshdaa káa is the main antagonist in the Bill Schweigert novel &quot;The Beast of Barcroft&quot; (2015).

They are also depicted in the book &quot;Shamans and Kushtakas: North Coast Tales of the Supernatural&quot; by Mary Giraudo Beck.

The short story &quot;Kushtuka&quot; by Mathilda Zeller, features the eponymous creature as a shapeshifter who assumes the image of the protagonist. The story is featured in the collection &quot;Never Whistle at Night: An Indigenous Dark Fiction Anthology&quot; published in 2023.

== In television ==

The Kóoshdaa káa is investigated in the 2015 Discovery Channel series Missing in Alaska in episode 10 &quot;Shapeshifters from the River&quot;.

The Kóoshdaa káa is investigated in the 2014 series Alaska Monsters in episode 3 &quot;The Otterman&quot;.

<text>The 95th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army. Today it exists as the 95th Training Division, a component of the United States Army Reserve headquartered at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Activated too late to deploy for World War I, the division remained in the Army&#x27;s reserve until World War II, when it was sent to Europe. Renowned for fighting back fierce German counterattacks, the division earned the nickname &quot;Iron Men of Metz&quot; for fighting to liberate and defend the town.

In April 1945, the 95th Infantry Division (United States) &quot;Victory&quot; division uncovered a German prison and civilian labor camp in the town of Werl. On April 7, the unit reported discovering a camp housing some 4,500 undernourished French officers and 800 enlisted men. The 95th provided the prisoners with emergency rations from the division&#x27;s own supplies.

After World War II, the division spent another brief period in reserve before being activated as one of the Army&#x27;s training divisions.

The 95th Infantry Division (United States) was recognized as a liberating unit by the United States Army Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1995.

Over the next fifty years the division would see numerous changes to its structure as its training roles changed and subordinate units shifted in and out of its command. It activated many regimental and brigade commands to fulfill various training roles. The division then began conducting one station unit training, a responsibility it continues to this day.

== History ==
=== World War I ===
The 95th Division was first constituted on 4 September 1918 in the National Army. The division, minus the 377th and 378th Infantry Regiments of the 189th Infantry Brigade and the 170th Field Artillery Brigade (including the 320th Ammunition Train), were organized at Camp Sherman, Ohio, in September. The 377th and 378th Infantry Regiments were intended to be organized in France from the 1st and 2nd Pioneer Infantry Regiments, while the 170th Field Artillery Brigade was organized in September at Camp Zachary Taylor and Camp Knox, Kentucky. By the end of October, the division had about 6,400 men, and by the end of November after the Armistice with Germany, 7,600. Training did not progress beyond the elementary phases, and the division was ordered to be demobilized on 30 November, with demobilization being completed on 22 December. The division was commanded by:

*Colonel Julien Edmund Victor Gaujot (acting), September 23–25, 1918
*Colonel Edward Croft (acting), September 25, 1918 – October 24, 1918
*Brigadier General Mathew C. Smith, October 24, 1918 – December 22, 1918

===Interwar period===

Pursuant to the National Defense Act of 1920, he 95th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Eighth Corps Area, and assigned to the XVIII Corps. The division was further allotted to the state of Oklahoma as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 31 August 1921 at the Oklahoma State Capitol building in Oklahoma City. It was relocated on 3 May 1922 to the Tradesmen&#x27;s National Bank Building in that city, and relocated once again in August 1924 to 203-1⁄2 West Grand Avenue. The headquarters remained there until activated for World War II. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the chief of staff published a newsletter titled &quot;The Observation Post.&quot; The newsletter informed the division&#x27;s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division&#x27;s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Fort Sill, Oklahoma, the location where much of the 95th Division&#x27;s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training with the 3rd Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 1925–27; 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 1927–33; and the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, 1933–39 at Fort Sill. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Eighth Corps Area. For example, the division&#x27;s artillery trained at Fort Sill with the 1st Field Artillery; the 320th Engineer Regiment trained at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and Fort Logan, Colorado, with the 2nd Engineer Regiment; the 320th Medical Regiment trained at Fort Sam Houston with the 2nd Medical Regiment; and the 320th Observation Squadron trained at Brooks Field, Texas. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC training held at Fort Sill each year.

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Eighth Corps Area and Third Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers&#x27; opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Eighth Corps Area, the 95th Division did not participate in the various Eighth Corps Area maneuvers and the Third Army maneuvers of 1938, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel. But, for each maneuver, the division maximized the number of participants. For example, for the 1938 maneuver at Camp Bullis, Texas, the 95th Division provided 173 officers to the 2nd Division and 68 to the National Guard&#x27;s 45th Division. Similar numbers participated in the two succeeding exercises.

===World War II===
On 15 July 1942, the division was ordered into active military service and reorganized at Camp Swift, Texas. Major General Harry L. Twaddle was assigned to command, and he remained in this position until the division was demobilized at the end of the war. The 189th and 190th Infantry Brigades were disbanded as part of an army-wide elimination of brigades. Instead, the division was based around three infantry regiments, the 377th Infantry Regiment, the 378th Infantry Regiment, and the 379th Infantry Regiment. The 380th Infantry Regiment remained in an inactive status, and was disbanded on 11 November 1944. Over the next two years, the division trained extensively in locations throughout the United States, including Camp Coxcomb in California.

====Order of battle====

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

==== Europe ====
The 95th Infantry Division was assigned to XIII Corps of the Ninth United States Army, Twelfth United States Army Group. The division sailed for Europe on 10 August 1944. The 95th Infantry Division arrived in England on 17 August. After receiving additional training, it moved to France one month later on 15 September. During this time it was reassigned to III Corps. The division bivouacked near Norroy-le-Sec, from 1 to 14 October. It was then assigned to XX Corps of the Third United States Army. The division was sent into combat on 19 October in the Moselle bridgehead sector east of Moselle and South of Metz and patrolled the Seille near Cheminot, capturing the forts surrounding Metz and repulsing enemy attempts to cross the river. It was during the defense of this town from repeated German attacks that the division received its nickname, &quot;The Iron Men of Metz.&quot; On 1 November, elements went over to the offensive, reducing an enemy pocket east of Maizières-lès-Metz. On 8 November, these units crossed the Moselle River and advanced to Bertrange. Against heavy resistance, the 95th captured the forts surrounding Metz and captured the city by 22 November.

The division pushed toward the Saar on 25 November and entered Germany on the 28th. The 95th seized a Saar River bridge on 3 December and engaged in bitter house-to-house fighting for Saarlautern. Suburbs of the city fell and, although the enemy resisted fiercely, the Saar bridgehead was firmly established by 19 December. While some units went to an assembly area, others held the area against strong German attacks. On 2 February 1945, the division began moving to the Maastricht area in the Netherlands, and by 14 February, elements were in the line near Meerselo in relief of British units. During this time the division returned to the Ninth Army under XIX Corps, though saw temporary assignments to several other corps through the spring.

On 23 February, the division was relieved, and the 95th assembled near Jülich, Germany, on 1 March. It forced the enemy into a pocket near the Hitler Bridge at Uerdingen and cleared the pocket on 5 March, while elements advanced to the Rhine. From 12 March, the 95th established defenses in the vicinity of Neuss. Assembling east of the Rhine at Beckum on 3 April, it launched an attack across the Lippe River the next day and captured Hamm and Kamen on the 6th. After clearing the enemy pocket north of the Ruhr and the Möhne Rivers, the division took Werl and Unna on 9/10 April, Dortmund on 13 April and maintained positions on the north bank of the Ruhr. It held this position until the end of the war.

====Casualties====
*Total battle casualties: 6,591
*Killed in action: 1,205
*Wounded in action: 4,945
*Missing in action: 61
*Prisoner of war: 380

==== Demobilization ====
The division returned to the United States on 29 June 1945 where it began the process of preparing to join the invasion forces of the Japanese Island of Honshu as part of the First United States Army. With the ending of the war in Japan, the division, remaining on orders for the Pacific, staged a minor mutiny before the orders were changed. This resulted in the division being demobilized and releasing its soldiers from Army service. It was inactivated on 15 October 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. The division took 31,988 German prisoners. Soldiers of the division were awarded one Medal of Honor, 18 Distinguished Service Crosses, 1 British Military Cross, 14 Legion of Merit Medals, 665 Silver Star Medals, 15 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 2,992 Bronze Star Medals, and 162 Air Medals. The division was awarded one Presidential Unit Citation and four campaign streamers during its time in combat.

===Cold War===
The division was reactivated on 13 May 1947 at Oklahoma City as a reserve unit. However, it was not mobilized for any combat duties following World War II. In 1952, the division underwent reorganization, with the first change being the addition of the 291st Infantry Regiment of Tulsa, Oklahoma, from the 75th Infantry Division. The second change that year for the division was the withdrawal of assignment of the 377th Infantry Regiment from the 95th, which was transferred to the 75th Infantry Division. The 377th had headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana since its activation after World War II.

The year 1955 saw further changes to the division and more changes of assignment for subordinate elements. On 1 January 1955, the 291st Regiment was again assigned to the 75th Infantry Division from the 95th and was subsequently inactivated on 31 January 1955. On 30 January, the 377th Regiment was reassigned to the 95th from the 75th and its headquarters moved from New Orleans to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The same date saw the relocation of the 379th Regimental headquarters from Hot Springs, Arkansas where it had been since 1947, to Little Rock, Arkansas.
On 1 April 1958 the 95th Infantry Division was redesignated as the 95th Division (Training) and a major reorganization of mission assignments was underway. Personnel trained for infantry combat, field artillery, military police and combat support roles were now to undergo re-training to enable them to train others. The division had a new role as one of the 13 Training Divisions in the Army Reserve. The same year the division&#x27;s size increased as the 291st Regiment was reassigned again from the 75th and was redesignated as 291st Regiment (Advanced Individual Training). With the reorganization of the division all of the regiments were redesignated. The 95th Divisional Artillery became the 95th Regiment (Common Specialist Training) with headquarters at Shreveport, Louisiana. The 377th became the 377th Regiment (Basic Combat Training), as did the 378th and 379th, and all were reassigned new training sites. In 1966, the division received a distinctive unit insignia.

In 1967, the division was reorganized according to the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan, part of an army-wide transformation. The division&#x27;s former World War II components were reorganized into brigades. The division&#x27;s former headquarters was reactivated as 1st Brigade, 95th Division at Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 920th Field Artillery Battalion became the 2nd Brigade, 95th Division, also in Tulsa. The 320th Engineer Battalion became the 3rd Brigade, 95th Division at Oklahoma City, and the 795th Ordnance Battalion became the 4th Brigade, 95th Division in Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1975, the division&#x27;s center was changed to Midwest City, Oklahoma.

The division was located in three states, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. The 1st Brigade was headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma and had elements of the 377th and 379th in regiments in its battalions. The 2nd Brigade was headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma with elements of the 378th and 379th Regiments. The 3rd Brigade was headquartered in Stillwater, Oklahoma, a move made in September 1975, and consisted of only 291st Regiment elements. The 4th Brigade was headquartered in Bossier City, Louisiana, a suburb of Shreveport, and includes the 95th Regiment and one element of the 379th. The Committee Group was headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas with no Regimental elements. The 95th Support Battalion was headquartered in Midwest City, Oklahoma with the Division Headquarters, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 95th Division Leadership Academy, and the 95th Division Maneuver Training Command. On 1 January 1979 the division&#x27;s four brigades was reorganized specifically for one station unit training.

The division experienced tremendous expansion in October 1984 with the addition of the 4073d US Army Reception Station, in Lafayette, Louisiana, with a strength of 809 personnel. The 402nd Brigade was also activated under the division&#x27;s administrative control. It was designated to expand the training base for the Army&#x27;s Field Artillery Training Center located at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. In 1989 the division&#x27;s location was returned to Oklahoma City.

===Present day===
The division continued its mission of training and operating one station unit training. In 1996, the division received three additional brigades as part of an Army consolidation of training commands. The 5th Brigade, 95th Division was activated in San Antonio, Texas, the 6th Brigade, 95th Division was activated in Topeka, Kansas, and the 7th Brigade, 95th Division was activated from the 95th Training Command in Little Rock, Arkansas.

In 2000, the brigade took on the additional responsibility of training Reserve Officer&#x27;s Training Corps cadets. The 8th Brigade, 95th Division was activated as a provisional unit in charge of ROTC units throughout the southwestern United States. In 2005, the division headquarters were relocated to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. This put the division at the area&#x27;s major training center, allowing it to more effectively provide training oversight.

==Heraldry==

===Shoulder sleeve insignia===

The division&#x27;s original shoulder sleeve insignia, adopted in the interwar period, was a monogram &quot;O&quot; and &quot;K,&quot; to denote the division&#x27;s assigned home area of the state of Oklahoma. On 29 August 1942, a revised shoulder sleeve insignia, consisting of an interlocked red &quot;9&quot; and white &quot;V&quot; on a blue oval background was approved for the 95th Infantry Division; the &quot;9&quot; and &quot;V&quot; refer to the unit&#x27;s numerical designation, while the &quot;V&quot; also alludes to victory. The red, white, and blue are the American national colors. The insignia was subsequently authorized for the 95th Division (Training) on 24 June 1968. On 14 April 1972, its description was revised.

===Distinctive unit insignia===

The device commemorates the crossing of the Moselle River and the breakthrough at Metz, symbolized by the blue wavy band and the black fortress. The blue wavy band further alludes to the Distinctive Unit Citation the division received for this action in World War II. The arrow alludes to the letter &quot;V&quot; for victory, and the nickname given the organization.

<text>The 8th Infantry Division, (&quot;Pathfinder&quot;) was an infantry division of the United States Army during the 20th century. The division served in World War I, World War II, and Operation Desert Storm. Initially activated in January 1918, the unit did not see combat during World War I and returned to the United States. Some units would serve in the American Expeditionary Force to Siberia. Activated again on 1 July 1940 as part of the build-up of military forces prior to the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, the division saw extensive action in the European Theatre of Operations. Following World War II, the division was moved to West Germany, where it remained stationed at the Rose Barracks in Bad Kreuznach until it was inactivated on 17 January 1992.

====Moving abroad====
In August 1918, Major General Graves, along with his staff, 5,000 men, and 100 officers, was transferred to Siberia to occupy Vladivostok in Russia as part of the intervention in the Russian Civil War. Major General Eli A. Helmick succeeded Graves in command of the division. The overseas movement of the division to Europe commenced on October 30, 1918.

The 8th Field Artillery Brigade, 8th Infantry Brigade, 16th Infantry Brigade headquarters, and the 319th Engineer Regiment were the only divisional units to go to France. The 13th and 62nd Infantry Regiments were at sea when recalled after the Armistice. The 12th Infantry did not leave its pre-embarkation point at Camp Mills, New York, because it was quarantined for Spanish influenza. The troops who did reach France became the garrison of Brest and assisted in building huge camps for troops about to embark for return to the United States. The 8th Infantry Regiment became part of the American occupation forces in Germany until August 1919 and the remainder returned to the United States in January 1919, after which the division disbanded.

===Between wars===
The 8th Division officially demobilized at Camp Lee, Virginia, in September 1919. The division was partially reconstituted on 24 March 1923, allotted to the Third Corps Area for mobilization purposes, and assigned to the III Corps. Camp George G. Meade, Maryland, was its designated mobilization station for reactivation. The 16th Infantry Brigade (12th and 34th Infantry Regiments), the 1st Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, the 15th Ordnance Company, and the 8th Tank Company (Light) were assigned to the division in June 1923 as Regular Army active units, and formed the force from which the remainder of the division would be reactivated in the event of war. The commanding general of the brigade was considered the division commander for planning purposes. The 16th Infantry Brigade was stationed at Fort Howard, Maryland, from 1922 to 1928; Fort Hunt, Virginia, from 1928 to 1931; in Washington, D.C., from 1931 to 1936; and at Fort Meade from 1936 to the activation of the division.

The division headquarters was organized in April 1926 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) unit using personnel of the Organized Reserve, and by mid-1927, most of the division&#x27;s other inactive elements were also organized as such. The active units of the division conducted annual training with the III and XIII Corps and the 79th, 80th, and 99th Divisions. Summer training camps were usually conducted at Camp Meade.

The 16th Infantry Brigade&#x27;s 12th and 34th Infantry Regiments, reinforced by the 3d Cavalry and the District of Columbia National Guard&#x27;s 260th Coast Artillery, were called out on 28 July 1932 to quell potential trouble from the Bonus Army in Washington, D.C. The 12th Infantry was ordered to clear the United States Capitol and the camps on the Anacostia Flats of the veterans that afternoon. From June 1936 to August 1937, the 16th Brigade was commanded by Lorenzo D. Gasser, who went on to serve as the Army&#x27;s assistant chief of staff for personnel (G-1) and Deputy Chief of Staff of the United States Army.

The division was also provisionally organized in 1939 for the First Army Maneuvers at Manassas, Virginia, with the 16th Brigade reinforced by the 66th Infantry (Light Tanks). In preparation for becoming a &quot;triangular&quot; division, the 8th Infantry Division was reactivated on 1 July 1940 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, less Reserve personnel, and assigned to the I Corps

Major General William C. McMahon was relieved shortly after the division arrived in Normandy. His replacement, Major General Donald A. Stroh was temporarily relieved during the Hurtgen fighting; the death of his son Harry, a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces who was shot down over Brittany, had made a deep psychological impact. After a rest, Stroh went on to command the 106th Infantry Division.

====Combat chronicle====
During World War II, the 8th Infantry Division was sent to Europe to fight against the Axis. After training in Northern Ireland, the division’s engineer unit, the 12th Engineer Combat Battalion (see division organization in WWII), landed on the morning of 6 June 1944 on Omaha Beach in support of U.S. forces landing in the area. The rest of the 8th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach, Normandy, 4 July 1944, and entered combat on 7 July. Shortly after its arrival, the division captured the French cities of Rennes and Brest. Fighting through the hedgerows, it crossed the Ay River, 26 July, pushed through Rennes, 8 August, and attacked Brest, France in September. When U.S. Brigadier General Charles Canham, who was at the time the deputy commander of the 8th Infantry Division, arrived to accept the surrender of German troops in Brest, the commander of the Brest garrison, General Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke asked the lower-ranking man to show his credentials. Canham pointed to his nearby troops and said &quot;These are my credentials&quot;. That phrase has since become the 8th Infantry Division&#x27;s motto.

Following these actions, the 8th turned eastward toward the German border, taking part in the heavy fighting in the Hürtgen Forest in November 1944. The Crozon Peninsula was cleared on 19 September, and the division drove across France to Luxembourg, moved to the Hürtgen Forest, 20 November, cleared Hürtgen on the 28th and Brandenberg, 3 December, and pushed on to the Roer.

That river was crossed on 23 February 1945, Düren taken on the 25th and the Erft Canal crossed on the 28th. The 8th reached the Rhine near Rodenkirchen, 7 March, and maintained positions along the river near Koeln. In early March 1945, the 8th had advanced into the Rhineland. It fought its way into the Ruhr region the following month.

On 6 April the division attacked northwest to aid in the destruction of enemy forces in the Ruhr Pocket, and by the 17th had completed its mission. After security duty, the division, under operational control of the British Second Army, drove across the Elbe, 1 May, and penetrated to Schwerin when the war in Europe ended.

On 2 May 1945, as it advanced into northern Germany, the 8th Infantry Division encountered the Neuengamme concentration camp Wöbbelin subcamp, near the city of Ludwigslust. The SS had established Wöbbelin in early February 1945 to house concentration camp prisoners who had been evacuated from other Nazi camps to prevent their liberation by the Allies. Wöbbelin held some 5,000 inmates, many of whom suffered from starvation and disease. The sanitary conditions at the camp when the 8th Infantry Division and the 82nd Airborne Division arrived were deplorable. There was little food or water, and some prisoners had resorted to cannibalism. In the first week after liberation, more than 200 inmates died. In the aftermath, the United States Army ordered the townspeople in Ludwigslust to visit the camp and bury the dead.

The 8th Infantry Division was recognized as a liberating unit by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1988.

====Medals of Honor====
Three soldiers of the 8th Division were awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II.

*Private First Class Ernest Prussman, 13th Infantry Regiment. Prussman took over his squad on 8 September 1944 during the advance on Les Coates &quot;[wrong transliteration of Loscoat, near Brest]&quot; in Brittany, and disarmed several Germans, including a machine gun crew. Shot by a German rifleman, his dying act was to unleash a hand grenade that killed the man who shot him. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously.
*Private First Class Walter C. Wetzel, 13th Infantry Regiment. As acting squad leader in the regimental Anti-Tank Company, PFC Wetzel defended his platoon&#x27;s command post from an enemy attack on 3 April 1945. Wetzel threw himself on either 1 or 2 enemy grenades (sources vary) thrown into the C.P. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously.
*Staff Sergeant John W. Minick, Company I, 121st Infantry Regiment. After his battalion was halted by enemy minefields during an advance on 21 November 1944 during the Hurtgen fighting, he led four men through the obstacle, then successfully destroyed an enemy machine gun post that had opened fire on the small party. Moving forward again, he single-handedly engaged an entire company of enemy soldiers, killing 20 men and capturing 20 more. Resuming the advance, he tried to scout through another minefield, but detonated a mine in the attempt. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously.

===After World War II===
The 8th Infantry Division was reactivated in 1950 as a training division at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and in 1954 became a regular infantry division. In 1956-57 it was sent to West Germany, initially on a temporary basis in Operation Gyroscope, but remained in West Germany for decades. The Division&#x27;s First Brigade (with subordinate units) was stationed in Mainz, the Second Brigade (with subordinate units) was stationed in Baumholder, and the Third Brigade (with subordinate units) was stationed in Mannheim (Sullivan and Coleman Barracks). In 1974, an amendment by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia led to two more brigades being organized for European service. The 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (&quot;Brigade-76&quot;) was dispatched to Europe in the fall of 1976. It was stationed in Wiesbaden, attached to the 8th Infantry Division, and for eight years, made it unique - the 8th ID became the Army&#x27;s only four-brigade division. In 1984, the 4th Brigade was inactivated and the division&#x27;s size fell to the standard three brigades. From December 1957, until it was inactivated in January 1992, the 8th Infantry Division was headquartered at Bad Kreuznach.

From the late 1950s until the early 1960s, the 8th Infantry Division was organized as a partially Airborne Pentomic division, with two of its five battle groups (the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 504th Infantry, and 1st Airborne Battle Group, 505th Infantry) on jump status. In 1963 the division was reorganized into a brigade structure with the 1st Brigade on jump status, and 1-504th was reorganized and reflagged as the 1st Battalion (Abn), 509th Infantry and 1-505th as the 2d Battalion (Abn), 509th Infantry. Supporting units throughout the division (for example, one field artillery battalion, one company of the engineer battalion, one platoon of the MP company, etc.) were also on jump status. The 8th Infantry Division operated its own jump school at Wiesbaden Air Base to support its 1st Brigade as well as other elements of the United States Army, Europe. In 1973 elements of the 1st Brigade were transferred to Vicenza, Italy, to establish a separate Airborne battalion combat team (1-509th INF) and the two Airborne infantry battalions were reorganized and reflagged as the 2d Battalion, 28th Infantry and the 2d Battalion, 87th Infantry. The reorganized 1st Brigade included a tank unit, the 4th Battalion, 69th Armor.

===Desert Storm===

Four battalions deployed to Operation Desert Storm.
* Attached to 3d Armored Division:
** 4th Battalion, 34th Armor
** 12th Engineer Battalion 
** 5th Battalion, 3d Air Defense Artillery 
* Attached to the 42d Field Artillery Brigade:
** 2d Battalion, 29th Field Artillery (M109A2/A3 155mm SP)

===Inactivation===
The 8th Infantry Division inactivated on 17 January 1992, with some elements being &quot;reflagged&quot; as part the 1st Armored Division, which had been stationed in southeastern West Germany.

==In Popular Culture==

2010 movie &quot;A-Team&quot;, General Morrison (portrayed by actor Gerald McRaney) wears the UCP version of the 8th I.D. patch.
Soldiers in the camp are seen wearing the same patch in UCP.

In the 1962 movie The Longest Day, a soldier of the 12th Engineer Battalion can be seen on Omaha Beach. This is recognizable by the 8th Infantry Division Patch on his left shoulder.

In the 2002 WW2 Hallmark movie, &quot;Silent Night&quot;, the US soldiers wear the 8th Infantry Division Patch.

The 2022 real-time strategy video game Warno features the 8th Infantry Division as a playable battlegroup based on its order of battle in 1989 in the Fulda Gap.

<text>The Selway–Bitterroot Wilderness is a protected wilderness area in the states of Idaho and Montana, in the northwestern United States. At 1.3 million acres (5,300 km²), it is one of the largest designated wilderness areas in the United States (14th overall, but third-largest outside Alaska).

The Selway–Bitterroot Wilderness spans the Bitterroot Mountain Range, on the border between Idaho and Montana, and covers parts of Bitterroot National Forest, Clearwater National Forest, Lolo National Forest, and the Nez Perce National Forest. The Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area is immediately to its south, separated from it only by a dirt road (the Magruder Corridor). Together with adjoining public land, the two wilderness areas form a five million-acre (20,000 km²) wild region.

It is here that the Lochsa and Selway rivers form and flow westward to their confluence at Lowell, Idaho (outside the wilderness along U.S. Route 12) to form the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River. The land ranges in elevation from on the Lochsa River to at Trapper Peak in the Bitterroot Mountains.

One of the largest elk herds in the United States calls the wilderness home, and it also boasts a healthy population of bighorn sheep. This wilderness is one of the areas being used to reintroduce wild packs of the grey wolf. The high-elevation areas around the Bitterroot peaks are rugged alpine parkland. Lower areas are covered by dense coniferous forest.

<text>The 80th Training Command (The Army School System – TASS) is a formation of the United States Army Reserve.

The unit was first organized in August 1917 and activated the following September during World War I as the 80th Division. During World War II, the Division was redesignated on 1 August 1942, as the 80th Infantry Division. Nicknamed the &quot;Blue Ridge Division&quot;, it was initially composed of draftees from the mid-Atlantic states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. The Division was redesignated the 80th Airborne Division from December 1946 to May 1952. In May 1952 and March 1959, the unit was redesignated as a reserve infantry division and then a reserve training division. In 1994, the unit was granted the designation, 80th Division (Institutional Training). On 1 October 2008, the unit underwent a major transformation and is now the 80th Training Command.

*** 317th, 318th, 319th, and 320th Ambulance Companies and Field Hospitals

The 317th Infantry included men from central and western Virginia; the 318th Infantry was made up mostly of men from the Shenandoah Valley and Tidewater areas; the 313th Machine Gun Battalion mostly had men from the Erie, Pennsylvania, area. These units comprised the 159th Infantry Brigade. The 318th Infantry were nicknamed the &quot;squirrels&quot; while training with the British in the Artois/Picardy section of France; the 1st Battalion was the &quot;red squirrels,&quot; the 2nd Battalion was the &quot;gray squirrels,&quot; and the 3rd Battalion was the &quot;flying squirrels.&quot;

The 319th Infantry included men from the Allegheny County and Erie areas, and a few from eastern Ohio. The 320th Infantry had men from Pittsburgh; the 315th Machine Gun Battalion had men from Pittsburgh and Erie. These units combined to create the 160th Infantry Brigade.

Each infantry regiment in the 80th Division used a unique helmet marking; the 317th used a diamond, the 318th a square, the 319th a circle, and the 320th Infantry Regiment a bowl shape. The headquarters of each regiment divided their shape using three vertical stripes of red, white, and blue; the 1st battalion of each regiment used solid red, the 2nd battalion white, and the 3rd battalion blue. Each company painted their respective letter inside the shape. The machine gun company of each regiment divided their shape vertically in half in red and blue; the supply company divided their shape in red and white.

The 313th, 314th and 315th Field Artillery Regiments were composed of men almost exclusively from the state of West Virginia, and formed the 155th Field Artillery Brigade.

Serving with the division were the 314th Machine Gun Battalion (men from the Tidewater area) as well as the 305th Engineer Regiment (men from the area east and north of Pittsburgh); the 305th Trains (Ammunition, Engineer, Supply and Sanitary) were men from western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia. The engineers were more often than not sent out ahead. During the rest period from 14 October through the Armistice, they finally were outfitted with U.S. Springfield and Browning automatic rifles. They had two weeks to train before the third and final push began in the Meuse-Argonne. It was also during this period that an attack formation was reorganized to allow for more maneuverability.

===Meuse-Argonne===
The 155th Field Artillery Regiment was in combat from the start of the Meuse Argonne, continuously with the 80th Division, but served also with the 90th Division into Germany, until after the Armistice. Altogether, the 155th served with five different divisions.

During the Meuse Argonne campaign, the 80th Division was the only one that saw action during each phase of the offensive (three times). And they first earned their motto, &quot;The 80th Division Moves only Forward!&quot;. The artillery of the division boasted more days of continuous combat firing than the batteries of any other American division. The 80th captured two Germans and one machine gun for every man wounded and one piece of artillery with gun crew for every 10 men wounded. Men of the 80th Division received 619 awards and decorations.

===Helmet insignias===
&quot;Previously announced, the distinctive symbols of the various units of the Division were declared official on 30 April 1918. For the four Infantry Regiments, in their order beginning with the 317th Infantry, they were a diamond, square, circle, and semi circle. The symbol of each unit&#x27;s Headquarters Company was colored red, white and blue; that of the Supply Company red and white; that of the Machine Gun Company red and blue. The battalion symbols were colored in red (Coys, A, B, C, D), white (Coys, E, F, G, H), blue (Coys, I, K, L, M) in numerical order. The three Machine Gun battalions were identified with a shield – blue and white (313th), red and white (314th), red and blue (315th), in order, beginning with the 313th M.G.Bn. Other Units of the Command were assigned equally distinctive symbols, thereby enabling property and individuals immediately identified by the markings required on the packing cases, wagons, helmets and other property articles&quot;.

All artillery units wear the &quot;Gun Sight&quot; on their helmets. It referenced the 313th F.A. and 314th F.A. with two blocks at approximately 45 degrees and 270 degrees. The 315th F.A. was 155mm and their &quot;Gun Sight&quot; emblem was a variation of this emblem. It contained the infantry colors (blue) in the four quadrants. In the center, there was a star and the battery letter was in the center of the star. The engineer units were identified by spades on their helmets. White and red for the headquarters company, red for the 1st Battalion (Companies A,B,C), white for the 2nd Battalion (Companies D, E, F).

==Interwar period==

The 80th Division headquarters arrived at the port of Newport News, Virginia, aboard the USS Zeppelin on 28 May 1919 after 12 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 5 June 1919 at Camp Lee, Virginia. It was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Third Corps Area, and assigned to the XIII Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. The division headquarters was organized on 1 September 1921 at 1014 East Main Street in Richmond, Virginia. It was relocated in 1926 to the Post Office Building, moved in 1933 to the Broad-Grace Arcade Building at Third and Grace Streets, and finally to the Parcel Post Building in 1935. The headquarters remained there until activated for World War II.

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp George G. Meade, Maryland, the location where much of the 80th&#x27;s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The division headquarters usually conducted its summer training there, and on a number of occasions, participated in command post exercises. The 80th Division headquarters occasionally trained with the staff of the 8th Division&#x27;s 16th Infantry Brigade. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 16th Infantry Brigade. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Second and Third Corps Areas usually with units of the 1st Division or the active elements of the 8th Division. For example, the division&#x27;s artillery trained with the 16th Field Artillery Regiment at Camp Meade; the 305th Engineer Regiment usually trained with the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware, or the 13th Engineers at Camp Humphreys, Virginia; the 305th Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 305th Observation Squadron trained with the 99th Observation Squadron at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Camp Meade each year.

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Third Corps Area or First Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Third Corps Area, the 80th Division did not participate in the Third Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or support personnel.

==World War II==
*Ordered into active military service: 15 July 1942; Initially, soldiers reported to Camp Forrest, Tennessee, named for General Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate Cavalry commander in the Civil War. The Division later moved for training at Camp Phillips, near Salina, Kansas and at Camp Iron Mountain and Camp Laguna at the Desert Training Center in the California – Arizona Maneuver Area (DTC / C-AMA). The 80th Division, as part of MG Alexander M. Patch Jr.&#x27;s IV Corps, were stationed at Camp Laguna, AZ about 25 miles North of Yuma AZ. The 80th remained at the DTC / C-AMA from December 1943 to March 1944.

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

===Combat chronicle===
On 5 August 1944, the 80th landed at Utah Beach. The division was destined to become the &quot;work horse&quot; of General Patton&#x27;s Third Army and to play a key role in the breakthrough at Avranches. The Division then attacked Argentan, taking it, 20 August, and creating the Falaise Pocket. After mopping up in the area, the 80th took part in the Third Army dash across France, cutting through Saint-Mihiel, Châlons, and Commercy in pursuit of the retreating Germans until stopped by the lack of gasoline and other supplies at the river Seille.

From 25 September to 7 November, the division maintained an aggressive defense of positions west of the Seille, and prepared for the Third Army sweep into the industrially vital Saar Basin. The attack jumped off on 8 November, the 80th advancing through Delme Ridge, Faulquemont, and St. Avold to within of Saarbrücken, when it was relieved by the 6th Armored Division, 7 December 1944.
====Battle of the Bulge====
After 10 days rest, the division returned to combat, moving southeast to take part in an attack on the Siegfried Line at Zweibrücken when the Germans launched their winter offensive in the Ardennes. The 80th was moved northward to Luxembourg and was hurled against the German salient, fighting at Luxembourg and Bastogne. By Christmas Day, men of the 80th were side by side with the tanks of the 4th Armored Division, battering forward through murderous opposition to help the 101st Airborne Division, besieged in Bastogne. Over frozen, snow-covered terrain, the attack gained nine bitter miles despite constant machine gun and mortar fire. The next day, the gap between the rescuers and the besieged was narrowed to 4000 yards. On 28 December, the 80th broke through, bringing relief to the 101st before driving the enemy across the Sure to Dahl and Goesdorf, 7 January 1945, and across the Clerf and Wiltz Rivers by 23 January. On 7 February 1945, the division stormed across the Our and Sauer Rivers at Wallendorf (Eifel), broke through the Siegfried Line, pursued the fleeing enemy to Kaiserslautern, 20 March, and crossed the Rhine, 27–28 March, near Mainz.

Pursuit continued in April, the division defeating the German defenders at Kassel, driving rapidly to Erfurt on the 12th, and Weimar, Jena, and Gera on the 14th. Relieved, 21 April, it moved to Nürnberg for occupation duty and on 28 April, to Regensburg, then to the Enns River, battling to the very end. It has been alleged that the last shot fired on the western front was in Czechoslovakia by the 80th, the last of General Patton&#x27;s divisions still in action. General Patton issued his cease-fire order at 0800 on 8 May 1945. By V-E day, the 80th Division had amassed 289 days of combat and had captured more than 200,000 enemy soldiers.

==Cold War==
The division was inactivated in January 1946, but reactivated in December of that year as the 80th Airborne Division. Since then, the division has been reorganized several times. As an airborne division, it became one of 24 organized Reserve Corps divisions. In 1952, during the Korean War, it was reorganized again as the 80th Infantry Division and remained as such for seven years. In March 1959, it was reorganized as the 80th Division (Training), with a primary focus of providing initial entry training to trainees at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Jackson, South Carolina, a mission and structure that lasted for many years. In 1988 and 1990, the division carried out ten-week exercises for wartime mobilization missions named, &quot;Old Dominion Forward&quot; at Fort Bragg, setting up training for nearly 700 new Soldiers.

==Persian Gulf War==
Units from the 80th Division were activated in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Two 80th Division units were called to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The 424th Transportation Company of Galax, Virginia, was activated 17 November 1990. After training and equipping at Fort Eustis, Virginia, it deployed to Saudi Arabia 5 January 1991. For its service in the war the company was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Citation reading: &quot;... under adverse conditions in a combat zone, logging over 850,000 accident- free road miles, in the countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.&quot; By the end of the war, elements of the 424th had advanced as far as the Euphrates River in support of coalition assault units. The 424th returned to the United States on 29–30 June 1991, and to home station 3 July. Soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 318th Regiment, 4th Brigade, at Fort Story, Virginia, were activated 23 January 1991, and reported to Fort Eustis to train recalled reservists. Because of the short duration of the ground war in Iraq and Kuwait, additional Individual Ready Reserve troops were not called up and the 3rd Battalion was released from active duty and returned to home station 17 March.

==New training reorganization==
In 1992, the division began a training base expansion mission at Fort Benning, Georgia. The mission changed to professional roundout training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the following year when Reservists worked with active duty Army drill sergeants in training new soldiers. October 1994 marked the fourth major reorganization since World War II, when it became Headquarters, 80th Division (Training). Maintaining the Initial Entry mission, it expanded to provide &quot;The Army School System&quot; or TASS mission. The 80th took command and control of 10 Army Reserve Forces schools, and along with legacy divisions from World War II (84th, 95th, 98th, 100th, 104th, and the 108th) became one of seven institutional training (IT) divisions, located in seven regions throughout the U.S. The 80th Division (IT) provided instructions for units in Region B which included Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Delaware. Seven brigades of the 80th Division (IT) carried out specific training missions in the above states and proceeded to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, to support expansion of the U.S. Army Training Center and to conduct Basic Combat Training (BCT), One Station Unit Training (OSUT) and other specialized training, as directed by Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).

==Global War on Terrorism==
*Operation Noble Eagle After 11 September 2001, specialized training commenced with drill sergeant and instructor units mobilized to training posts in the U.S.
*Operation Enduring Freedom in 2004, 80th Division (IT) units provided training and reconstruction support to the Afghanistan government.
*Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2005 in support, the 80th Division (IT) mobilized and deployed to Iraq in support of the largest activation of the division&#x27;s soldiers since World War II, serving in every specialty and skill as a part of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq. Two soldiers were killed in action and two others died stateside while mobilized during this conflict.

During the period 17 May 2005 to 15 August 2006, 80th Division (Institutional Training) displayed outstanding meritorious service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit planned and executed the largest mobilization and combat-zone deployment of the Army Reserve Division since 1945. Additionally, the unit was responsible for training and advising over 106,000 Iraqi Army Soldiers to include: two Iraqi Army Division Headquarters, seven Iraqi Brigade Headquarters, and twenty-two Battalions of Iraqi Soldiers.

So far 80th Division soldiers have earned more than 1,144 medals and citations including 31 Purple Hearts, 2 Bronze Stars with Combat V, 467 Bronze Stars, 84 Combat Infantryman Badges (CIB) and 187 Combat Action Badges (CAB). The unit continues to support the Global War on Terrorism with individual and group deployments to the theater of operations as required.

==80th Training Command==
On 1 October 2008, the 80th Division (IT) transformed to become the 80th Training Command (TASS). It expanded from the five states to reach across the entire country. Of the seven IT divisions, only three remain, with the 80th taking command of the entire TASS mission for the Army Reserve. The 80th expanded from eight brigades and 12 battalions to three divisions (94th, 100th, 102nd), 13 brigades, 63 battalions, and 14 training centers. The 80th is the third-largest command organization in the U.S. Army Reserve. Made up of over 7,300 Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to 15 brigade units aligned under three major subordinate one-star commands with units located nationwide—from Pennsylvania to Puerto Rico and from the Carolinas and Georgia to California. It has an operational control training relationship with a unit in Hawaii and a support relationship with a unit in Germany.

The command&#x27;s annual economic impact is about $40–60 million. In addition to the salaries of full-time civilian and military personnel, this figure also includes pay to Army Reserve soldiers, money spent locally for the purchase of supplies, services, maintenance support, equipment, facility construction and renovation, and the G.I. Bill college tuition payments to Army Reserve soldiers attending school.

The 80th trains Army soldiers in the career military fields for Combat Support and Combat Service Support. The 94th Training Division (Force Sustainment) headquarters is located at Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia (Erstwhile Fort Lee) and became fully mission capable in October 2009. The 100th Training Division (Operational Support) has its headquarters in Louisville. Kentucky, and will soon relocate to Fort Knox. The 102nd Training Division (Maneuver Support) headquarters is located at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and also became fully mission capable in October 2009.

<doc id="889500" wikidata="Q3184285" url="?curid=889500" title="Joseph-Goderic Blanchet">
<text>Joseph-Goderic Blanchet (or Joseph-Godric; June 7, 1829 – January 1, 1890) was a Canadian physician and politician. He was the only person to serve as both speaker of the House of Commons and speaker of a provincial legislature. He represented Lévis in the House of Commons as a Liberal-Conservative member from 1867 to 1873 and from 1879 to 1883; he represented Bellechasse from 1875 to 1878. He also represented Lévis in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1867 to 1875.

== Biography ==
He was born in Saint-Pierre-de-la-Rivière-du-Sud, Lower Canada in 1825. He studied at the Petit Séminaire de Québec and Collège de Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière. He then studied medicine with his uncle Jean Blanchet and qualified as a doctor in 1850. A popular physician, Blanchet entered politics with his election as mayor of Notre-Dame-de-la-Victoire, now part of Lévis Quebec (then Canada East) in 1845 at the age of 25. With the Province of Canada on military alert due to the American Civil War, Blanchet joined the militia and raised a battalion to defend the frontier against raids from the United States. During the Fenian Raids of 1866 and 1870, he was in command of the militia on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River.

Blanchet was a Conservative and first ran for election to the Legislative Assembly in 1857 but was defeated. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Lévis in 1861 and 1863. He supported Canadian Confederation as a means of defending British North America against possible attack by the United States.

He was concurrently elected in the 1867 federal election to the new House of Commons and to the Quebec Legislative Assembly. Under the law of the day, he was allowed to be a member of both legislatures at the same time.

He became Speaker of the provincial legislature and served in that position for two terms.

In the federal House of Commons, Blanchet was appointed by John A. Macdonald to the parliamentary committee to investigate allegations related to the Pacific Scandal in 1873.

The federal election law was changed in 1874 to prohibit members of Parliament (MPs) from concurrently sitting in a provincial legislature. Blanchet chose to resign his seat in the federal House of Commons. After losing his seat in the Quebec legislature to the much younger Étienne-Théodore Pâquet in the 1875 Quebec provincial election, he won a federal by-election in 1875 and returned to Ottawa as MP for Bellechasse. In the 1878 federal election, he ran in his old riding of Lévis. The election returned the Conservatives to power, and Macdonald nominated Blanchet to be speaker of the House of Commons.

Due to the tradition of alternating between English and French Speakers after each election, he returned to the backbenches following the 1882 election despite a successful term as Speaker. In 1883, he resigned from Parliament in order to accept a position as Collector of Customs for the Port of Quebec and served in that position until his death at Lévis in 1890 at the age of 60. He was buried in the crypt of Notre-Dame Church of Lévis.

<text>Echis coloratus, known as the painted saw-scaled viper, painted carpet viper, Burton&#x27;s carpet viper, and by other common names, is a highly venomous viper species endemic to the Middle East and Egypt. No subspecies are currently recognized.

==Description==
It grows to a maximum total length (body + tail) of .

==Common names==

Painted saw-scaled viper, painted carpet viper, Burton&#x27;s carpet viper, Palestine saw-scaled viper, Arabian saw-scaled viper, Mid-East saw-scaled viper.

==Geographic range==
It is found in the Middle East in Sinai, Palestine, and Jordan. On the Arabian Peninsula it has been recorded from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. In Africa it occurs in eastern Egypt east of the Nile and as far south as the 24th parallel.

The type locality given is &quot;on Jebel Shárr, at an altitude of 4500 feet ... Midian&quot; (Saudi Arabia, 1371 m altitude).

==Habitat==
It occurs in rocky deserts, from sea level to altitudes as high as . It is not found in sandy deserts.

==Taxonomy==
In order to maintain nomenclatural stability, Stimson (1974) proposed that &quot;E. coloratus&quot; be validated over &quot;E. froenata&quot;. The ICZN subsequently gave &quot;coloratus&quot; precedence over &quot;froenata&quot; by use of its plenary powers.

<text>The 100th Training Division (Leader Development) (formerly the 100th Infantry Division) is a division of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Knox, Kentucky. It currently serves as a major training command of the United States Army Reserve. It has been known as the &quot;Century Division&quot; owing to its &quot;100th&quot; designation.

Throughout its long history, the division has taken on numerous roles. Serving as the 100th Infantry Division until the 1950s, the division then briefly became the 100th Airborne Division
before becoming the 100th Division (Training). Since this transformation, the division has primarily taken on numerous training roles for other Army units.

It was originally activated in mid-1918, too late to join the fighting in World War I. The division is best known for its exploits during World War II as the 100th Infantry Division. Fighting in the European Theater, the division advanced through France and Germany through the end of the war, fending off heavy German counterattacks along the way. World War II would be the only war the division would see active combat in before taking on a role as a training unit.

==History==

===World War I===

On 23 July 1918, the War Department directed the organization of the 100th Division at Camp Bowie, Texas. Plans called for the division to include a headquarters, headquarters troop, the 199th Infantry Brigade (397th and 398th Infantry Regiments and 374th Machine Gun Battalion), 200th Infantry Brigade (399th and 400th Infantry Regiments and 375th Machine Gun Battalion), 373rd Machine Gun Battalion, 175th Field Artillery Brigade (373rd-375th Field Artillery Regiments and 25th Trench Mortar Battery), 325th Engineers, 625th Field Signal Battalion, and 325th Train Headquarters and Military Police (Ammunition, Engineer, Sanitary, and Supply Trains). It was intended that the 199th Infantry Brigade would be organized in France from the 56th and 57th Pioneer Infantry Regiments. 

The 25th Trench Mortar Battery was formed at Camp Stanley, Texas, in August 1918 and was assigned to the 175th Field Artillery Brigade, but never ended up joining. The organization of the division began in October with the appointment of Colonel William L. Reed as division chief of staff, but organization never progressed beyond the assignment of the division staff and preliminary preparations for the receipt of Selective Service men. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the 100th Division was ordered demobilized on 30 November 1918.

===Interwar period===

The 100th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Fifth Corps Area, and assigned to the XV Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of West Virginia and Kentucky as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 27 September 1921 at 209 Greenbriar Street in Charleston, West Virginia, but relocated in April 1922 to 815 Quarrier Street and moved again in September 1922 to the Morrison Building in Charleston. On 29 May 1923, the division received its shoulder sleeve insignia. The headquarters was relocated a final time on 30 June 1928 from 1313 Union Bank and Trust Building in Charleston to the Coal Exchange Building in Huntington, and remained there until activated for World War II. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter titled “The Century,” which alluded to the division&#x27;s numerical designation. The newsletter informed the division&#x27;s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division&#x27;s summer training quotas were, when and where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC). As the 1920s gave way to the 1930s and many World War I-experienced Reservists began to retire, the single largest cohort of the division&#x27;s assigned officers became new ROTC (Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps) graduates chiefly from West Virginia University in Morgantown, the University of Kentucky in Lexington, or Western Kentucky State Teachers&#x27; College in Bowling Green.

The 100th Division headquarters occasionally trained with the staff of the 5th Division&#x27;s 10th Infantry Brigade at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 10th Infantry Brigade at Camp Knox or Fort Thomas, Kentucky, or Fort Benjamin Harrison. Some years, the division&#x27;s 167th and 168th Infantry Brigades and their subordinate units conducted camp at the Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Fifth Corps Areas, usually with active units of the 5th Division. For example, the division&#x27;s artillery trained with the 5th Division field artillery units stationed at Camp Knox; the 309th Engineer Regiment usually trained at Fort Benjamin Harrison; the 309th Medical Regiment trained at Camp Knox; and the 309th Observation Squadron trained with the 88th Observation Squadron at Wright Field, Ohio. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility for conducting the infantry CMTC training held at Camp Knox and Fort Thomas each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Fifth Corps Area and Second Army command post exercises (CPXs) in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Fifth Corps Area, however, the 100th Division did not participate in the various Fifth Corps Area maneuvers and the Second Army maneuvers of 1936, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

On 15 August 1942, the War Department designated Major General Withers A. Burress as division commander, Colonel Maurice L. Miller as assistant division commander, and Colonel Theodore A. Buechler as division artillery commander. Miller and Buechler were later promoted to brigadier general. The officer cadre (regimental, battalion, and company commanders) was designated by the end of August, and was dispatched to training schools to prepare them for their new assignments. In October 1942, they reported to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and were joined by about 400 &quot;filler&quot; officers principally obtained from officer candidate schools. In mid-October, the non-commissioned officer cadre, provided principally by the 76th Infantry Division arrived at Fort Jackson. The 100th Infantry Division was officially ordered into active military service on 15 November 1942. Over 13,000 enlisted fillers, consisting of men from all across the United States, &quot;salesmen from New York; farmers from the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama; mechanics from New Jersey; clerks from the New England states; mill workers from Pennsylvania and Delaware,&quot; arrived in short order thereafter. Basic training began on 28 December 1942.

From late 1943 to early 1944, the division trained in the mountains of Tennessee and was subsequently sent to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for further training. While at Fort Bragg, Technical Sergeant Walter L. Bull earned the first Expert Infantryman&#x27;s Badge.

Between January 1943 and August 1944, the division sent 14,636 enlisted men and 1,400 officers as cadres or fillers for other units or to overseas replacement depots. The latter transfers were to obey two War Department directives issued in January and February 1944. The first was that the greatest possible proportion of men sent overseas as replacements have at least six months of training. The latter was to prohibit 18 year olds and men with children conceived prior to Pearl Harbor who had less than six months of training from being sent overseas as replacements unless men could be found from other sources. In June 1944, the age rule became even stricter, with no men under 19 shipped as replacements in infantry or armor under any circumstances, and no men under 18 years and 6 months assigned to infantry or armor replacement training centers.

Between April 1944 (&quot;when the initial age rules began to have a substantial effect&quot;) and September 1944 (when the age policy came to an end), the 100th Infantry Division lost 125 infantry noncommissioned officers and 3,859 privates. In exchange, the division received men from replacement training centers (particularly starting in the summer, when demand for replacements in all theaters became so high that the centers, rather than units, again became the primary source of overseas replacements), the pared-down Army Specialized Training Program, aviation cadets returned to the ground forces, men from disbanded units in other branches of the Army (principally antiaircraft and tank destroyer), and men who had volunteered for the infantry from other branches of the Army.

The division sailed to Europe on 6 October of that year. The division arrived at Marseille, France, on 20 October. It was made part of VI Corps of the Seventh United States Army, Sixth United States Army Group.

===European Theater===
As soon as the division was prepared for combat, it began moving into the Meurthe-et-Moselle region, and sent its first elements into combat at St. Remy in the Vosges Mountains on 1 November 1944. The division as a whole began the relief of the 45th Infantry Division at Baccarat on 5 November, and assumed control of the sector on 9 November. The attack jumped off on 12 November, and the division drove against the German Winter Line in the Vosges Mountains. The 100th took Bertrichamps and Clairupt, pierced the German line, and seized Raon-l&#x27;Étape and Saint-Blaise-Moyenmoutier between 16 and 26 November. Later in November the division moved into the Vosges region, elements assisted in holding the Saverne Gap bridgehead while the bulk of the division went into reserve. The unit was relieved from assignment to VI Corps and transferred to the US XV Corps on 27 November 1944. It then moved into the Moselle region.
In December 1944, the division went on the offensive in the vicinity of Bitche, France. The division occupied the nearby areas of Wingen and Lemberg after fierce fighting on 6–10 December. The division then advanced to Reyersviller, which fell after fighting on 11–13 December. On 14 December, regiments from the 100th started their assault on a minor fortification Freundenburg and Fort Schiesseck, a major defensive work in the region. Fort Freundenburg was captured on 17 December by the 100th division&#x27;s 398th Infantry Regiment. Fort Schiesseck capitulated after three more days of heavy assault by the 100th on 20 December. The division was ordered to halt its attack and to hold defensive positions south of Bitche as part of the Seventh Army during the Battle of the Bulge. Thanks to a stout defense, the men of the 100th later became known as the &quot;Sons of Bitche&quot;. The German counterattacks of 1 and 8–10 January 1945 were repulsed, after heavy fighting at Bitche. After further attacks stalled and the Germans began to withdraw, the sector was generally quiet and the division prepared to resume its offensive east.

On 15 March 1945, the attack jumped off and on 16 March, Bitche fell to the 100th Infantry Division. The unit was then relieved from assignment to XV Corps, and transferred to XXI Corps on 22 March 1945. Taking Neustadt and Ludwigshafen, the division reached the Rhine River on 24 March. On 25 March 1945, the unit was returned from XXI Corps back to VI Corps. On 31 March 1945, the 100th Infantry Division crossed the Rhine and moved south in the wake of the 10th Armored Division and then east across the Neckar River, establishing and enlarging a bridgehead from 4 to 11 April. Heilbronn fell after nine days of house-to-house combat on 12 April and the division resumed its rapid pursuit of the enemy, reaching Stuttgart by 21 April. The 100th was mopping up along the Neckar, southeast of Stuttgart on 23 April, when it was removed from VI Corps and assigned directly to the Seventh United States Army as an Echelon Above Corps Asset. The division was then assigned primarily to patrolling the sector east of Stuttgart. Shifting to Göppingen on 30 April, the Division engaged in occupational duties as the war in Europe came to an end on V-E Day. The division had spent 163 days in combat.

The division took 13,351 enemy prisoners of war on its own. Members of the division won three Medals of Honor, seven Distinguished Service Crosses, five Legions of Merit, 492 Silver Star Medals, 23 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 5,156 Bronze Star Medals, and 90 Air Medals. The division itself was awarded three campaign streamers for participation in the campaign.

100th Infantry Division returned to the United States via the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation on 10 January 1946, and was released from active duty at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia that day. The division then began the process of demobilization, before inactivating on 26 January.

==Post War==

===Cold War===
In fall of 1946, the division was reactivated in the U.S. Army Reserve as the 100th Airborne Division in Louisville, Kentucky. This distinction as one of the few airborne divisions within the U.S. Army was brief; in 1952 the division was once again redesignated the 100th Infantry Division. It would change names again in 1955, this time to 100th Division (Replacement Training). It would once again be reorganized in 1959 to its present designation as 100th Division (Institutional Training). Its mission became to teach basic, advanced, and common training skills to soldiers from the Army&#x27;s active, reserve, and National Guard components.

In 1961, some 1,500 soldiers from the 100th were activated and sent to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, in order to provide support during the Berlin Crisis. During their time on active duty, the 100th successfully trained some 32,000 soldiers after thoroughly rebuilding and fixing the old Army base. The unit was returned to reserve status again in August 1962. In 1968, the division received its distinctive unit insignia, which alluded to its history in World War II and as a Kentucky-based unit.

With the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan in 1968, the division ceased to be centered on regiments and instead was reorganized with brigades. However, with the 199th Infantry Brigade active as a separate brigade, the division&#x27;s new brigades were activated from units that had been under its command in World War II. The division&#x27;s headquarters element (which had since been replaced by a Headquarters and Headquarters Company) was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 100th Division responsible for basic armor school training. The 928th Field Artillery Battalion became the 2nd Brigade, 100th Division responsible for armored cavalry unit training. The 325th Engineer Battalion became the 3rd Brigade, 100th Division responsible for combat support training, and the 800th Ordnance Battalion became the 4th Brigade, 100th Division, responsible for combat service support training.

In 1978, the 100th became the first Army Reserve formation to be equipped with its own squadrons of M1 Abrams tanks. With the arrival of the M3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, the division&#x27;s mission profile changed from individual combat training to armor and armor reconnaissance training. By 1986, it was the largest reserve unit within the state of Kentucky, commanding fifty-eight percent of instate reservists.

===Gulf War and beyond===
At the outbreak of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the 100th was assigned to armor training at Fort Knox, Kentucky for deploying armor units. Armor training was a responsibility that the division continued after the war.

In 1995 the division was reorganized to include Army Reserve schools, taking over the responsibilities for new programs. In 1996 the 100th Division&#x27;s 1st Brigade worked with Readiness Group Knox to pioneer the national training experiment to reserve combat units at crew and platoon levels. Later that year, the division added three additional divisional brigades; the 5th Brigade, 100th Division in Memphis, Tennessee for health services training, the 6th Brigade, 100th Division in Louisville, Kentucky for professional development training, and the 7th Brigade, 100th Division at Fort Knox, formed from the 100th Training Command and responsible for training exercises. The 5th Brigade moved to Millington, Tennessee in 1997, and the 7th Brigade inactivated in 2000. The 8th Brigade, 100th Division was also activated as a unit overseeing ROTC training.

During 1997, the division was tasked with partial responsibility for Operation Future Challenge at Fort Knox, a six-week Reserve Officer&#x27;s Training Corps Basic Camp during each summer. By 2000, the 100th has assumed full responsibility for running the camp. Later that same year, the 100th began inactivating many of its M1A1 Abrams tanks as part of a reduction in military expenditures.

After the September 11 attacks, the 100th Division began taking on the job of preparing Army National Guard units from Ohio and Kentucky as they began to prepare for deployment in support of the War on Terrorism.

By 2006, the division had moved its headquarters from Louisville to Fort Knox, easing distance strains in administration and training. In line with Army Reserve transformations, the 100th Division restructured, eliminating all but four of its brigades. The division shifted its focus from initial entry training to providing military occupational specialty and non-commissioned officer training for four army career fields across the United States. The 100th Division (Operational Support) teaches soldiers subjects from military intelligence, signal corps, civil affairs/psychological operations and health services.

On 1 October 2018 the 100th Training Division was redesignated as the 100th Training Division (Leader Development). The 100th Training Division (Leader Development) establishes and implements the Army Reserve Leader Development Strategy to provide a continuum of career education, training, and experience for leaders in the Army Reserve. During this reorganization, the 83rd USARRTC and the 97th (CGSOC) Brigade were placed under the 100th Training Division.

== Subordinate units ==

==Legacy==
The division&#x27;s legacy in World War II has been honored several times. The Cross Island Parkway in Queens, New York was renamed the &quot;100th Infantry Division Parkway&quot; in 2005 in honor of 2,300 soldiers from New York that served with the division during the war. Three soldiers earned the Medal of Honor serving with the division in World War II. They were Edward A. Silk, Mike Colalillo, and Charles F. Carey Jr.

<text>The root position of a chord is the voicing of a triad, seventh chord, or ninth chord in which the root of the chord is the bass note and the other chord factors are above it. In the root position, uninverted, of a C-major triad, the bass is C — the root of the triad — with the third and the fifth stacked above it, forming the intervals of a third and a fifth above the root of C, respectively.

In figured bass, a root-position triad has no symbol, while a root-position seventh chord is notated with a &quot;7&quot;.

According to &quot;The American History and Encyclopedia of Music:&quot;

Note that any voicing above the bass is allowed. A root position, or uninverted, chord must have the root chord factor in the bass, but it may have any arrangement of the third and fifth above that, including doubled notes, compound intervals, and omission (C-E-G, C-E-G-E&#x27;, C-G&#x27;-E&quot;, etc.)

<text>The 102nd Infantry Division (&quot;Ozark&quot;) was a unit of the United States Army in World War II. The unit is currently active as the 102nd Training Division (Maneuver Support).

==Interwar period==
The division was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Seventh Corps Area, and assigned to the XVII Corps, with Arkansas and Missouri as its home area. The headquarters was organized on 2 September 1921 at 3rd and Olive Streets in St. Louis, and relocated in 1923 to the Old Customhouse. The headquarters remained there until activated for World War II. To encourage esprit de corps, the division adopted the nickname “Ozark” after the mountainous region that ran through both states, and the division staff published a newsletter titled “Ozark.” The division formed rapidly and by November 1922, it had 95 percent of the officers as required by its peacetime tables of organization.

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Fort Riley, Kansas. The headquarters and staff usually trained at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the 17th Infantry Regiment at Fort Leavenworth. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Sixth and Seventh Corps Areas, often with the active units of the 7th Division. For example, the division’s artillery trained at Fort Riley; the 327th Engineer Regiment also trained at Fort Riley with Troop A, 9th Engineer Squadron; the 327th Medical Regiment trained at the Medical Corps training camp at Fort Snelling, Minnesota; and the 327th Observation Squadron trained with the 16th Observation Squadron at Marshall Army Airfield, Kansas. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Fort Leavenworth each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Seventh Corps Area and Fourth Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Seventh Corps Area, the 102nd Division did not participate in the various Seventh Corps Area maneuvers and the Fourth Army maneuvers of 1937, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises.

In the 1920s and 1930s Harry S. Truman, a lieutenant colonel in the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps, commanded the division&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 379th Field Artillery Regiment. After promotion to colonel, Truman advanced to command of the 379th Field Artillery Regiment.

===Order of battle===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split. The 408th Infantry Regiment was inactivated by relief of remaining Reserve personnel on 6 January 1942, and disbanded on 11 November 1944.

===Combat chronicle===
The 102nd Infantry Division, under the command of Major General Frank A. Keating, arrived on the Western Front in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) at Cherbourg, France, 23 September 1944, and, after a short period of training near Valognes, moved to the German-Netherlands border. On 26 October, elements attached to other divisions entered combat and on 3 November the division assumed responsibility for the sector from the Wurm to Waurichen. A realignment of sectors and the return of elements placed the 102nd in full control of its units for the first time, 24 November 1944, as it prepared for an attack to the Roer. The attack jumped off, 29 November, and carried the division to the river through Welz, Flossdorf, and Linnich.

After a period of aggressive patrolling along the Roer, 4–19 December, the division took over the XIII Corps sector from the Wurm River, north of the village of Wurm, to Barmen on the south, and trained for river crossing. On 23 February 1945, the 102d attacked across the Roer (Operation Grenade), advanced toward Lövenich and Erkelenz, bypassed Mönchengladbach, took Krefeld, 3 March, and reached the Rhine. During March the division was on the defensive along the Rhine, its sector extending from Homburg south to Düsseldorf. Crossing the river on 9 April on pontoon bridge, the division attacked in the Wesergebirge, meeting stiff opposition. After 3 days and nights of terrific enemy resistance Wilsede and Hessisch-Oldendorf fell, 12 April 1945, and the 102d pushed on to the Elbe, meeting little resistance. Breitenfeld fell, 15 April, and the division outposted the Elbe River, 48 miles from Berlin, its advance halted on orders. Storkau experienced fighting on the 16th, EHRA on the 21st along with Fallersleben. On 3 May 1945 the 102nd shook hands with the Russian 156th Division just outside Berlin.
On 15 April the division discovered a war crime in Gardelegen: the Isenschnibbe Barn Atrocity. About 1,200 prisoners from the Mittelbau-Dora and Hannover-Stöcken concentration camps were forced from a train into an empty barn measuring approximately a hundred by fifty feet on the outskirts of the town. The barn was then set afire, killing those inside. About 1,016 people were killed. However, two men survived, buried under a shield of dead bodies, protecting them from the gunfire and flames. When the first soldiers arrived at the barn, the two came crawling out from under the dead and burning bodies. Major General Keating ordered that the nearby civilian population be forced to view the site and to disinter and rebury the victims in a new cemetery. After digging the graves and burying the bodies, they erected a cross or a Star of David over each grave and enclosed the site with a white fence. Today both the former crime scene and the Cemetery of Honour are parts of the Isenschnibbe Barn Memorial Gardelegen.

The division patrolled and maintained defensive positions until the end of hostilities in Europe, then moved to Gotha for occupation duty.

The division and subordinate elements were inactivated on 31 December 1965. Later, when the 102d Army Reserve Command was formed as a regional headquarters for Army Reserve units within the same general area where the 102d Infantry Division had been located, the shoulder sleeve insignia was authorized for wear by units of the 102d ARCOM, such as the military police unit stationed at Richards Gebaur AFB near Belton, Missouri. The lineage of the 102d Division is perpetuated by the 102d Training Division.

== Subordinate units ==

<text>The 103rd Infantry Division (&quot;Cactus Division&quot;) was a unit of the United States Army that served in the U.S. Seventh Army of the 6th Army Group during World War II.

It was variously assigned to the VI Corps, XV Corps, and XXI Corps. By war&#x27;s end it was part of VI Corps&#x27; dash across Bavaria into the Alps, reaching Innsbruck, Austria, taking the Brenner Pass, and earning the honor of linking up with the U.S. Fifth Army coming north from Vipiteno, Italy, joining the Italian and Western European fronts on 4 May 1945.

==Interwar period==

The 103rd Division was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Eighth Corps Area, and assigned to the XVIII Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 31 August 1921, at the State Capitol in Denver. The headquarters was moved on 29 March 1922 to the Kittredge Building at 16th Street and Glenarm Place in Denver and remained there until activated for World War II. To encourage esprit de corps, in 1922 the division’s officers adopted the nickname “Rocky Mountain Division” after the majestic mountain range that defined much of the division’s home area. However, this nickname soon gave way to the moniker “Cactus Division” after the unit’s shoulder patch. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter appropriately titled “The Cactus.” The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The large geographical area of the division made it difficult to bring subordinate units of the division together for virtually any training events except for those units in Denver; the division headquarters, special troops, 206th Infantry Brigade (less one regiment), 176th Field Artillery Brigade (less one regiment), and a few other assorted units were located in that city. Inactive training period activities of the division were generally conducted at the local level near concentrations of division personnel. One event that turned out large numbers of the Denver members of the division was the Memorial Day parade held in that city each year. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training with the 25th Infantry Regiment at Fort Huachuca and Camp Stephen D. Little, Arizona, and with the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment. at Fort Logan, Colorado. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Eighth Corps Area. For example, the division’s artillery regiments trained at Fort Bliss, Texas, with the 82nd Field Artillery, or at Fort Francis E. Warren, Wyoming, with the 2nd Battalion, 76th Field Artillery; the 328th Engineer Regiment trained with the 2nd Engineers at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and later at Fort Logan; the 320th Medical Regiment trained at Fort Sam Houston with the 2nd Medical Regiment; and the 328th Observation Squadron trained at Brooks Field and some years at Fort Bliss.

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Eighth Corps Area and Third Army command post exercises (CPXs) in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Eighth Corps Area, however, the 103rd Division did not participate in the various Eighth Corps Area Maneuvers and the Third Army maneuvers of 1938, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel. However, for each maneuver, the division maximized the number of participants. For example, for the 1938 maneuvers at Fort Francis E. Warren, Fort Bliss, and Fort Huachuca, the 103rd Division provided 228 officers to Regular Army units and 53 to units of the National Guard&#x27;s 45th Division. Similar numbers participated in the two succeeding Army maneuvers.

==World War II==

*Campaigns: Ardennes-Alsace, Rhineland, Central Europe
*Awards: Distinguished Service Cross (United States)-12; Distinguished Service Medal (United States)-1; Silver Star-299; LM-3; SM-14; BSM-2,669; AM-92
*Commanders: Maj. Gen. Charles C. Haffner Jr. (November 1942 – January 1945), Maj. Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe (January–July 1945), Brig. Gen. John N. Robinson (August 1945 to inactivation).

===Combat chronicle===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 103rd Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 15 November 1942 at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. The officer and enlisted cadre came from the 85th Infantry Division at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and the enlisted fillers arrived from reception centers located in the 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Service Commands (Camp Grant, Illinois, 4,060; Fort Custer, Michigan, 3,845; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 1,307; Camp Dodge, Iowa, 1,036; Fort Snelling, Minnesota, 990; Eighth and Ninth Service Command reception centers, 921; Fort Bragg, North Carolina, 600; Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, 600; Fort McPherson, Georgia, 537; Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, 526; Fort Jackson, South Carolina, 218). 

During 1944, the division lost 2,550 enlisted men from transfers to other divisions or to overseas replacement depots, and replenished its ranks with men transferred from antiaircraft artillery, coast artillery, and tank destroyer units, and aviation cadets and Army Specialized Training Program students reassigned to other duties. After nearly two years of training, the 103rd departed the United States for Europe on 5 October 1944. The division arrived at Marseilles, France, 20 October 1944. It relieved the 3d Division at Chevry on 8 November, arrived at Docelles (Vosges) on 9 November, and attacked west of St. Dié, 16 November, in its drive through the Vosges. Meeting heavy resistance all the way, it crossed the Meurthe River, took St. Dié on 23 November and captured Diefenbach on 29 November and Selestat on 4 December.

The division crossed the Zintzel river at Griesbach, 10 December 1944. Pushing through Climbach, the 103rd crossed the Lauter River into Germany, 15 December, and assaulted the outer defenses of the Siegfried Line. On 22 December, the division moved west to the Sarreguemines area where an active defense was maintained. The enemy offensive did not develop in its sector and the 103rd moved to Reichshofen, 14 January 1945, to take up positions along the Sauer River. On 15 January, General Anthony &quot;Nuts&quot; McAuliffe was redeployed from the Battle of the Bulge and given command, which he retained until July 1945. Defensive patrols were active and a limited attack on Soufflenheim on 19 January was repulsed by the enemy. On 20 January, the division withdrew to the Moder and repulsed German advances near Muehlhausen, 23–25 January. The 103rd&#x27;s offensive began on 15 March 1945. Crossing the Moder and Zintzel rivers and taking Muehlhausen against sharp opposition, the division moved over the Lauter river and penetrated the defenses of the Siegfried Line.

As German resistance disintegrated, the 103rd reached the Upper Rhine Valley, 23 March, and engaged in mopping up operations in the plain west of the River Rhine. In April 1945, it received occupational duties until 20 April when it resumed the offensive, pursuing a fleeing enemy through Stuttgart and taking Münsingen on 24 April. On 27 April, elements of the division entered Landsberg, where Kaufering concentration camp, a subcamp of Dachau, was liberated. The men of the division crossed the Danube River near Ulm on 26 April. On 3 May 1945, members of its 409th Infantry Regiment captured Innsbruck, Austria with little to no fighting. The 411th Infantry Regiment continued on to take the Brenner Pass and earn the honor of linking up with the 88th Infantry Division of the Fifth Army, which had been fighting its way north up the Italian peninsula. Troops met at Vipiteno, Italy, near the Austrian border, on 4 May 1945, joining the Italian and Western European fronts.

After Victory in Europe Day, the division received occupational duties until it left for home and inactivation. It returned to the continental U.S. on 10 September 1945, and was inactivated on 22 September 1945 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.

<doc id="889551" wikidata="Q15622974" url="?curid=889551" title="Joy buzzer">
<text>A joy buzzer (also called a hand buzzer) is a practical joke device that consists of a coiled mainspring inside a disc worn in the palm of the hand. When the wearer shakes hands with another person, a button on the disc releases the spring, which rapidly unwinds creating a vibration that mimics an electric shock to the unsuspecting victim.

==History==
The joy buzzer was invented in 1928 by Soren Sorensen &quot;Sam&quot; Adams of the S.S. Adams Co. It was modeled after &quot;The Zapper&quot;, a product that was similar to the joy buzzer, but did not have a very effective buzz and contained a button with a blunt point that would hurt the recipient&#x27;s hand.

Adams brought a large prototype of his newly designed buzzer to Dresden, Germany, where a machinist created the tools that would make the parts for a new palm-sized Joy Buzzer. In 1932, the item received from the U.S. Patent Office. The instant success of the new item allowed Adams to move to a new building and increase the size of his company. Adams continued to send royalty payments to the tool and die maker until 1934 when the payments were returned.

In 1987, Sam Adamses&#x27; son, Joseph &quot;Bud&quot; Adams, redesigned the mechanism for greater durability and a louder buzz, marketing it as the &quot;Super Joy Buzzer&quot;.

==Electric shock==
A common misconception, largely due to false advertising by the makers of the device, is that the joy buzzer delivers an electric shock, when in fact it only causes a vibration simulating a shock.

==In pop culture==
The joy buzzer has found its way into several pop culture media since its creation.
*Some stylized villains in fiction (e.g. Batman&#x27;s nemesis The Joker) employ &quot;lethally powerful&quot; joy buzzers as weapons.
*In Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse cartoon film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Rival&quot; (1936), Mickey Mouse&#x27;s hands are shocked by Mortimer Mouse&#x27;s trousers.
*In the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Pranks a Lot&quot; (2004), Patrick Star&#x27;s hand is shocked by a joy buzzer.
*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homie the Clown&quot; (1995), Homer Simpson is shocked with a joy buzzer multiple times by Krusty the Clown to the point where he is tortured by it. Two years later it makes another appearance in &quot;Principal and the Pauper&quot; (1997) where Bart used it on Principal Seymour Skinner promoting the reply &quot;What the... Oh an enjoyment buzzer!&quot;.

==Related device variations== 
Some device variations were later created to actually shock the person being pranked rather than simulate the shock with vibrations. These devices include the shocking pen, which generates a mild electric shock when a victim clicks the button on top, or shocking gum, which also delivers a mild electric shock when a victim touches or pulls upon what appears to be the last stick of gum from a box.

<doc id="889552" wikidata="Q4642222" url="?curid=889552" title="66th Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 66th Infantry Division was a unit of the United States Army during World War II. Activated 15 April 1943, the division trained at Camp Blanding, Florida, and was later transferred to Camp Robinson, Arkansas and then later to Camp Rucker, Alabama before being shipped overseas to England on 26 November 1944. Commanded by Maj. Gen. Herman F. Kramer, the 66th Infantry Division&#x27;s main role in World War II was containing and eliminating the remaining pockets of German soldiers in Northern France.

==Combat chronicle==
Three regiments of the 66th Infantry Division arrived in Dorchester, England on 26 November 1944, and the rest of the Division joined them on 12 December 1944. They trained and prepared for deployment until 24 December 1944, then transferred to Southampton before crossing the English Channel to Cherbourg, France. Two transport vessels, &quot;SS Cheshire&quot; and the Belgian &quot;Leopoldville&quot; carried the 66th across the English Channel. However, only 5 miles from the port of Cherbourg, the &quot;Leopoldville&quot; was torpedoed by a German U-Boat and sunk, taking the lives of 14 officers and 748 enlisted soldiers. The U.S. Navy later announced the sinking of the &quot;Leopoldville&quot; to be the second-largest loss of life from the sinking of a troop transport ship in the entire European Theater.

Primarily involved with destroying the German troops left behind in port cities in western France such as Lorient, St. Nazaire, Royan and La Rochelle following the retreat during the summer of 1944, the 66th Infantry Division relieved the 94th Infantry Division of control of the Brittany-Loire area on 29 December 1944, and collaborated with French forces as well. The 66th carried out its objective by harassing German installations, conducting limited objective attacks, and running reconnaissance missions to gather intelligence. The use of artillery shelling many German positions also played a major part in the advancement of the 66th through the region. Notably, a heavy German attack near La Croix was repulsed on 16 April 1945 and several strongly fortified enemy positions were taken from 19 to 29 April 1945 in a series of counterattacks. The remaining German soldiers surrendered to 66th Infantry Division officers and French officials in a small cafe near Cordemais on 8 May 1945.

Ordered to change to an occupation-oriented mission on 14 May 1945, the 66th made a 700-mile trek into Germany where the Black Panthers occupied 2,400 square miles of territory and the city of Koblenz. As a security force, the division was charged with establishment of a military government and control of all German affairs. Tasks included the discharge of prisoners of war, inventorying of ammunition and supplies, and organizing civilians. After spending time in Germany, the 66th returned to the French coast to aid with the allied withdrawal from the European Theater. During this time, the composition of the division was changed by the beginning of the inactivation process, until it returned to the U.S. and was formally inactivated, sailing for home 27 October 1945.

===Order of battle===

The division consisted of these units:

* Headquarters, 66th Infantry Division
* 262d Infantry Regiment
* 263d Infantry Regiment
* 264th Infantry Regiment
* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 66th Infantry Division Artillery
**721st Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm)
**870th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)
**871st Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)
**872d Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)
* 266th Engineer Combat Battalion
* 366th Medical Battalion
* 66th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized)
* Headquarters, Special Troops, 66th Infantry Division
** Headquarters Company, 66th Infantry Division
** 766th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company
** 66th Quartermaster Company
** 566th Signal Company
** Military Police Platoon
** Band
* 66th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment

The 422d and 423d Infantry Regiments (from the 106th Infantry Division) were attached to the division from 15 April to 15 May 1945.

===Casualties===
*Total battle casualties: 1,452
*Killed in action: 795 (Includes SS Leopoldville disaster)
*Wounded in action: 636
*Prisoner of war: 21

==Assignments in European Theater of Operations==
*27 December 1944: 12th Army Group.
*31 March 1945: Fifteenth Army, 12th Army Group.

==Aesthetic==
*Nickname: Black Panther Division
*Shoulder sleeve insignia: The snarling panther suggests the power, aggressiveness and endurance of the Division. The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 26 August 1943

The shoulder sleeve insignia was designed by Nicolas Viscardi (known professionally as Nick Cardy), a comic book artist who served in the Division during World War II. Viscardi won a competition to design the patch, and subsequently created the iconic logo. Viscardi also earned two Purple Hearts for wounds suffered as a tank driver while serving with the 3rd Armored Division.

<doc id="889561" wikidata="Q2352270" url="?curid=889561" title="M-8 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-8 is a state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan lying within the cities of Detroit and Highland Park. Much of it is the Davison Freeway, the nation&#x27;s first urban depressed freeway, which became a connector between the Lodge (M-10) and the Chrysler (Interstate 75, I-75) freeways.

Named for Jarad Davison, an English immigrant to the area, Davison Avenue was originally the only street connecting across Highland Park to Detroit. It was rebuilt by the city and Wayne County as a freeway during World War II. The roadway was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 1993 and numbered as M-8. Subsequent changes by the state rebuilt the freeway and extended the M-8 designation to connect to the Jeffries Freeway (I-96).

==Route description==
M-8 starts on the western end at an interchange with I-96 in Detroit. Davison Avenue continues west of this interchange forming a service drive for the freeway while M-8 uses a short section of freeway to connect between I-96 and Davison Avenue. This short freeway segment runs easterly to Livernois Avenue where the trunkline transitions into Davison Avenue. East of this transition, the roadway turns northeasterly running through residential areas of Detroit. The trunkline meets M-10/Lodge Freeway on the border between Detroit and Highland Park, a city surrounded by Detroit. Northeast of this interchange, M-8 becomes the Davison Freeway, running depressed below the level of the cross streets. There are interchanges for M-1/Woodward Avenue and Oakland Avenue before meeting the Chrysler Freeway (I-75) on the eastern border of Highland Park. The Davison Freeway continues northeasterly in Detroit north of Hamtramck. The freeway ends between Gallagher and Newbern avenues. M-8 continues to Conant Street where the designation ends. Davison Avenue continues past Mound Road where it turns back due east until it ends at Van Dyke Street next to the Mt. Olivet Cemetery.

MDOT&#x27;s 2007 traffic surveys counted the average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of the number of vehicles using a section of roadway on any given day of the year. An average of 38,000 vehicles used the western section of M-8 along Davison Avenue in 2007 each day; the eastern segment carried 37,300 vehicles. The section of freeway in between carried in excess of 50,000 vehicles a day in 2007 between M-10 and I-75. Of this traffic, 1,900 trucks and other commercial vehicles used the trunkline.

==History==
Davison Avenue predates both the Davison Freeway and the M-8 state trunkline designation in the area. The roadway was named for Jarad Davison, an English immigrant and one of the early settlers of the area. The street was the only one of the 30 parallel streets in Highland Park that crossed through the city from border to border and connected with Detroit streets. This road was heavily congested, approaching gridlock during rush hour by 1940. A traffic survey showed that 96% of the traffic using the street was crossing Highland Park with no destination in the city. A proposal to rebuild the street as a six-lane, limited-access highway was approved by the Highland Park City Council on March 17, 1941. The council also appropriated $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for the construction with Wayne County and the remaining $3,400,000 (equivalent to $ in ) paid by state and federal government appropriations.

The freeway construction required a half-block of right-of-way on the south side of Davison Avenue and the demolition of 69 homes to accommodate the of excavation along the project. Another 63 homes were moved. The outbreak of World War II accelerated the construction schedule after the project was given priority due to the defense plants near the roadway. The freeway opened for traffic without a dedication ceremony at 4:00 p.m. on November 25, 1942. Travel times across Highland Park dropped from 15 minutes to around 3–4 minutes after the freeway opened. The roadway was the first urban, depressed freeway in the United States. The concrete for the road bed was cured underwater by flooding, creating an extremely hard and durable surface which lasted for more than 50 years (some requiring dynamite for its eventual removal).
In 1968, the freeway was extended eastward a few blocks through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the freeway to state control and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another freeway in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to state control in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained freeway, the Davison Freeway was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed for a year and a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened on October 8, 1997, by Governor John Engler.

In 2001, M-8 was extended to include the segment of Davison Avenue between the freeway&#x27;s western terminus and Davison Avenue&#x27;s junction with I-96 (Jeffries Freeway). Except for a M-8 shield on the Lodge Freeway&#x27;s Davison Avenue exit signs, the non-freeway portion of M-8 remains unsigned, including at the Davison Avenue exit from the Jeffries where new Clearview signs were erected as part of a large I-96 reconstruction project in 2005.

===Combat chronicle===
The division was first activated at Camp Meade, Maryland in August 1917, composed primarily of draftees from Maryland and Pennsylvania. After a year of training the division sailed overseas in July 1918. The 79th Division saw extensive combat in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive area where it earned the name of &quot;Cross of Lorraine&quot; for their defense of France. The division was inactivated June 1919 and returned to the United States.

Throughout its entire World War I campaign, the division suffered 6,874 casualties with 1,151 killed and 5,723 wounded. Private Henry Gunther, the last American soldier to be killed in action during World War I, served with the 313th Infantry Regiment of the 79th Division.

==Interwar period==

The 79th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Third Corps Area, and assigned to the XIII Corps. The division was further allotted to the eastern half of Pennsylvania as its home area. The headquarters of the “Lorraine Division” was originally organized on 29 September 1921 at the Schuylkill Arsenal, 2620 Gray’s Ferry Road in Philadelphia. It was later relocated in 1930 to the Gimbal Building at 35 South Ninth Street. It was again relocated in 1935 to the New Custom House Building at Second and Chestnut Streets and remained there until activated for World War II. After activation, the division’s recruiting efforts were such that by 1926, the division was at 85 percent of its authorized strength. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter, the “79th Division Bulletin.” The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as
when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC). The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp George G. Meade, the location where much of the 79th’s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The division headquarters usually conducted its summer training there, and on a number of occasions, participated in command post exercises there as well. During these camps, the 79th Division headquarters occasionally trained with the staff of the 16th Infantry Brigade, 8th Division. In May 1929, the 79th Division conducted a &quot;contact camp&quot; at Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania, and almost 500 of the division’s officers attended. The highlight of the camp was an aerial demonstration performed by the 99th Division’s 324th Observation Squadron.

The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 16th Infantry Brigade. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster trained at various posts in the Second and Third Corps Areas usually with units of the 1st Division or the active elements of the 8th Division. For example, the division’s artillery trained with the 16th Field Artillery at Camp Meade; the 304th Engineer Regiment usually trained with the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware, or the 13th Engineer Regiment at Camp Humphreys, Virginia; the 304th Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 304th Observation Squadron trained with the 99th Observation Squadron at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC training held at Camp Meade each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Third Corps Area or First Army CPXs in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. Perhaps the division’s most ambitious CPX was a division-level exercise conducted around the clock for almost 2 weeks from 31 July to 12 August 1938. In January 1940, many officers of the 79th Division headquarters attended a week of additional annual training performed by the 28th Division; the training was part of a War Department-directed effort to increase the readiness of National Guard units that winter. The 79th Division officers voluntarily participated in the training without pay. Unlike Regular Army and National Guard units in the Third Corps Area, the 79th Division did not participate in the Third Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

===Combat chronicle===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 79th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service at Camp Pickett, Virginia on 15 June 1942, around a cadre of officers and enlisted men from officer candidate schools and the 4th Infantry Division, with the general staff selected by the War Department and Army Ground Forces. The initial enlisted fillers for the division arrived over a period of about two weeks after activation, and were principally Selective Service men from reception centers in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Corps Areas, comprising the Mid-Atlantic, Southern, Great Lakes, and Midwestern states (the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming)

After basic training, it participated in exercises in the Tennessee Maneuver Area, after which it moved to Camp Laguna near Yuma, Arizona, where it trained in the desert. It was then ordered to Camp Phillips, Kansas for training in winter conditions. At the beginning of April 1944, the division reported to the port of embarkation at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts.

The division arrived in Liverpool on 17 April and began training in amphibious operations. After training in the United Kingdom from 17 April 1944, the 79th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach, Normandy, 12–14 June and entered combat 19 June 1944, with an attack on the high ground west and northwest of Valognes and high ground south of Cherbourg Naval Base. The division took Fort du Roule after a heavy engagement and entered Cherbourg, 25 June. It was around this time that Corporal John D. Kelly and First Lieutenant Carlos C. Ogden, both of the 314th Infantry Regiment, were awarded the Medal of Honor. It held a defensive line at the Ollonde River until 2 July 1944 and then returned to the offensive, taking La Haye du Puits in house-to-house fighting, 8 July. On 26 July, the 79th attacked across the Ay River, took Lessay, crossed the Sarthe River and entered Le Mans, 8 August, meeting only light resistance. The advance continued across the Seine, 19 August. Heavy German counterattacks were repelled, 22–27 August, and the division reached the Therain River, 31 August. Moving swiftly to the Franco-Belgian frontier near St. Amand (east of Lille), the division was then moved to XV Corps in eastern France, where it encountered heavy resistance in taking Charmes in street fighting, 12 September. The 79th cut across the Moselle and Meurthe Rivers, 13–23 September, cleared the Forêt de Parroy in a severe engagement, 28 September – 9 October, and attacked to gain high ground east of Emberménil, 14–23 October, when it was relieved, 24 October.

After rest and training at Lunéville, the division returned to combat with an attack from the MignevineMontiguy area, 13 November 1944, which carried it across the Vezouse and Moder Rivers, 18 November – 10 December, through Haguenau in spite of determined enemy resistance, and into the Siegfried Line, 17–20 December. The division held a defensive line along the Lauter River, at Wissembourg from 20 December 1944 until 2 January 1945, when it withdrew to Maginot Line defenses. The German attempt to establish a bridgehead west of the Rhine at Gambsheim resulted in furious fighting. The 79th beat off German attacks at Hatten and Rittershoffen in an 11-day battle before withdrawing to new defensive positions south of Haguenau on the Moder River, 19 January 1945. The division remained on the defensive along the Moder until 6 February 1945. During February and March 1945, the division mopped up German resistance, returned to offensive combat, 24 March 1945, crossed the Rhine, drove across the Rhine-Herne Canal, 7 April, secured the north bank of the Ruhr and took part in clearing the Ruhr Pocket until 13 April. The division then went on occupation duty, in the Dortmund, Sudetenland, and Bavarian areas successively, until its return to the United States and inactivation.

<doc id="889570" wikidata="Q17082987" url="?curid=889570" title="Worse-than-average effect">
<text>The worse-than-average effect or below-average effect is the human tendency to underestimate one&#x27;s achievements and capabilities in relation to others. 

It is the opposite of the usually pervasive better-than-average effect (in contexts where the two are compared or the overconfidence effect in other situations). It has been proposed more recently to explain reversals of that effect, where people instead underestimate their own desirable traits.

This effect seems to occur when chances of success are perceived to be extremely rare. Traits which people tend to underestimate include juggling ability, the ability to ride a unicycle, the odds of living past 100 or of finding a U.S. twenty dollar bill on the ground in the next two weeks.

Some have attempted to explain this cognitive bias in terms of the regression fallacy or of self-handicapping. In a 2012 article in Psychological Bulletin it is suggested the worse-than-average effect (as well as other cognitive biases) can be explained by a simple information-theoretic generative mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).

<text>Outer Subcarpathia (; ; ; ) denotes the depression area at the outer (western, northern and eastern) base of the Carpathian arc, including foothills of the Outer Western Carpathians and Outer Eastern Carpathians. It stretches from northeastern Austria, through eastern Czech Republic, southern Poland, western Ukraine and northeastern Romania. 

The opposite foothill regions on the inner side of the Carpathian arc are known as &quot;Inner Subcarpathia&quot;, transitioning further to the Pannonian Basin.

==Geography==


The western end is marked by the (northern) Vienna Basin, separating it from the Eastern Alpine Foreland. The adjacent hilly landscape of the Lower Austrian Weinviertel region with its extensive loess layers border on the limestone rock formations of the South-Moravian Carpathians. 

In the Czech Republic, the depression is situated on the outskirts of the White Carpathians in Moravia, including the Pálava Protected Landscape Area. In Poland they stretch along the Lesser Poland Voivodeship to the Podkarpackie Voivodeship, part of the Galicia historic region that leads to Ukraine (Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi Oblast) and the Dniester Basin. 

In Romania, the depression ends east of the Carpathian arc on the upper Moldova River within the Bukovina and Moldavia regions, bordering on the Wallachian Plain in the south.

<text>Robert Franklin Sutherland, (April 5, 1859 – May 23, 1922) was a Canadian politician and Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 1905 to 1909, noted for his fine speaking ability and strong temperament.

Sutherland was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Essex North in the 1900 election. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections.

He was born in Newmarket in Canada West in 1859. After studies at the University of Toronto and University of Western Ontario, Sutherland began his career as a lawyer in Windsor, Ontario. He was a member of the city council, and first ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in 1900 and was elected. During the campaign in a riding with a large francophone and Catholic population, he was accused of having been a member of the anti-Catholic Protestant Protective Association. While he admitted having attended a meeting out of curiosity, he insisted that he refused to join the group upon learning of its anti-Catholic views. Once elected, he concentrated on constituency issues and obtaining grants for his riding.

By the time of the next general election in 1904, Sutherland had learned some French and was able to campaign in the language. Following the election, he was nominated by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to become Speaker of the House, and was the first anglophone Speaker to give part of his acceptance speech in French.

Laurier offered to renominate Sutherland for the Speakership following the 1908 election, but he declined, and was appointed the next year to a seat on Ontario&#x27;s High Court. He became a respected judge and mediator.

He was later appointed to chair a Royal Commission in Ontario to investigate a proposal by Sir Adam Beck to establish a network of radial lines (that is, a system of inter-city streetcar lines). Sutherland&#x27;s report argued against the scheme and it was not implemented.

<doc id="889581" wikidata="Q1126275" url="?curid=889581" title="Pakora">
<text>Pakora () is a fritter originating from the Indian subcontinent. They are sold by street vendors and served in restaurants across South Asia. They often consist of vegetables such as potatoes and onions, which are coated in seasoned gram flour batter and deep-fried.

Other spellings include pikora, pakoda, and pakodi, and regional names include [[bhaji]], bhajiya, bora, ponako, and chop.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pakoṛā&quot; is derived from Sanskrit पक्ववट &quot;pakvavaṭa&quot;, a compound of &quot;pakva&quot; (&#x27;cooked&#x27;) and &quot;vaṭa&quot; (&#x27;a small lump&#x27;) or its derivative &quot;vaṭaka&quot;, &#x27;a round cake made of pulse fried in oil or ghee&#x27;. The word &quot;Bhajji&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;Bharjita&quot; meaning &quot;fried&quot;.

Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word. The sound is a hard &#x27;da&#x27; in the Telugu language and the &#x27;ra&#x27; sound would be an incorrect pronunciation. The sound is the retroflex flap , which is written in Hindi with the letter ड़, and in Urdu with the letter ڑ.

However, in the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration, the Hindi letter ड़ is transliterated as &lt;ṛ&gt;, popular or non-standard transliterations of Hindi use &lt;d&gt; for this sound, because etymologically, it derives from ड . The occurrence of this consonant in the word &quot;pakora&quot; has given rise to two common alternative spellings in English: &quot;pakoda&quot;, which reflects its etymology, and &quot;pakora&quot;, which reflects its phonology.

==History==
An early variation of pakora appears in Sanskrit literature and Tamil Sangam literature but the recipe is not clearly provided as they only mention it as &#x27;a round cake made of pulse fried in oil&#x27; and &#x27;crispy fried vegetables&#x27; which were served as part of the meals. Early known recipes come from Manasollasa (1130 CE) cookbook which mentions &quot;Parika&quot; (pakoda) and the method of preparing it with vegetables and gram flour. Lokopakara (1025 CE) cookbook also mentions unique pakora recipe where gram flour is pressed into fish-shaped moulds and fried in mustard oil.

==Preparation==
Pakoras are made by coating ingredients, usually vegetables, in a spiced batter, and then deep frying them.

Common varieties of pakora use onion, masoor dal (lentil), suji (semolina), chicken, arbi root and leaves, eggplant, potato, chili pepper, spinach, paneer, cauliflower, mint, plantain or baby corn. 

The batter is most commonly made with gram flour or a mixture of gram flour and rice flour but variants can use other flours, such as buckwheat flour. The spices used in the batter are up to the cook and may be chosen due to local tradition or availability; often these include fresh and dried spices such as chilli, fenugreek, ginger, cardamom, turmeric and coriander.

==Serving==
Pakoras are eaten as a snack or appetiser, often accompanied by chutney or raita. They are also offered with &quot;masala chai&quot; to guests at Indian wedding ceremonies.

==Regional names==

A gram-flour fritter is known in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka as &quot;pakoda&quot; or &quot;bajji&quot;, in Gujarat as &quot;bhajia&quot;, in Maharashtra as &quot;bhaji&quot;, and in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and Karnataka as &quot;bajji&quot; or &quot;pakodi&quot;. &quot;Pakoda&quot;in Bengal (some parts) &quot;Jhal pitha&quot; may be interpreted in these states as deep-fried balls of finely chopped onions, green chilis, and spices mixed in gram flour. In Manipur, it is known as &quot;bora&quot;.

<doc id="889591" wikidata="Q6005882" url="?curid=889591" title="Impact bias">
<text>In the psychology of affective forecasting, the impact bias, a form of which is the durability bias, is the tendency for people to overestimate the length or the intensity of future emotional states.

== Overview ==
People display an impact bias when they overestimate the intensity and durability of affect when making predictions about their emotional responses. It is a cognitive bias that has been found in populations ranging from college students (e.g. Dunn, Wilson, &amp; Gilbert, 2003; Buehler &amp; McFarland, 2001), to sports fans (Wilson et al, 2000), to registered voters (Gilbert et al, 1998).

=== Affective Forecasting ===

Research shows that people often make errors about how much positive or negative effect an event will have on us. People mispredict their emotional reactions (how much pleasure or displeasure an event will bring them) when they mispredict how the event will occur. These mistaken projections can lead to mistaken assumptions about the impact of an event on their happiness. Generally, people accurately predict the valence, if an event will generate a positive or negative reaction, but people are less accurate in their predictions about the intensity and the duration of these effects.

=== Mistaken projections ===
To make decisions, people try to predict how an event will play out and what it will make them feel. However, when making these predictions, people are subject to many cognitive biases, including the impact bias. Research shows that people’s projections are often mistaken (e.g. Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2005; Buehler &amp; McFarland, 2001; Loewenstein &amp; Schake, 1999). Early studies revealed that this phenomenon is a result of people’s inability to anticipate how their feelings will be affected by external factors, and change over time (e.g. Kahneman, 1994). People are more prone to make errors about intensity and duration of affect, than about valence. These mistaken projections affect people’s ability to make decisions that maximize their happiness.

== Example ==

In Gilbert et al., 1998, there was a conducted study on individuals participating in a job interview. The participants were separated into two groups; the &quot;unfair decision condition&quot; (where the decision of being hired was left up to a single MBA student with sole authority listening to the interview) and the &quot;fair decision condition&quot; (where the decision was made by a team of MBA students who had to independently and unanimously decide the fate of the interviewee). Then, certain participants were chosen to forecast how they would feel if they were chosen or not chosen for the job immediately after learning if they had been hired or fired and then they had to predict how they would feel ten minutes after hearing the news. Then following the interview, all participants were given letters notifying them they had not been selected for the job. All participants were then required to fill out a questionnaire that reported their current happiness. Then after waiting ten minutes, the experimenter presented all the participants with another questionnaire that once again asked them to report their current level of happiness.
The predictions made by the participants in both the unfair and fair groups were about the same regarding how they would feel immediately after hearing the news as well as ten minutes later. Both groups accurately predicted how they would feel immediately after hearing the news. The study showed that both groups felt much better than they had originally predicted, ten minutes later, demonstrating the impact bias.

== Causes ==

Explanations for the occurrence of the impact bias include the following:

=== Misconstrual Problem ===
Misconstrual of future events:
When predicting how an experience will impact us emotionally, events which have not been experienced are particularly difficult. Often what we think an event may be like does not relate to what the experience is like. People know that the future is uncertain, but fail to recognize their projections as construals, subjective perceptions or interpretations of reality. (Griffin &amp; Ross, 1998; Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2003). Misconstruals can be responsible for a great range of mispredictions because there is no limit to the degree of error one can make. It leads to the impact bias when misconstruals are accurate about the valence of an event, but overpredict intensity and duration of emotional reaction.

Inaccurate theories:
People have created cultural theories and had experiences that greatly influence beliefs of how an event will affect us. For example, American culture has emphasized a correlation between wealth and happiness, however despite this belief; money does not necessarily bring happiness.

Motivated Distortions:
When faced with a negative event people may have forecasts that are overestimated and can evoke either comfort or fear in the present. The overestimation however can often be used to soften the effects of an event or make it easier by the reality not being as extreme as the forecasted impact.

Under correction (anchoring and adjustment):
People anchor their prediction on how they currently feel and never accurately adjust their predictions. An illustrative example proposed by Wilson and Gilbert (2005), is that if you are currently in bed with a cold, and are invited to a party a month from now, it will be very difficult to separate your negative feelings from your prediction of how you will feel on a Saturday night a month later. This process is sometimes referred to as the projection bias (Loewenstein et al., 1999) whereby people’s affective forecasts are unconsciously or consciously influenced by their current state.

=== Focalism ===
Often when making a prediction of the impact of an event people focus solely on the event in question. This ignores the fact that with the passage of time, other events will occur that influence happiness. Disregarding the effect of unrelated events on future thoughts emotions, leads to erroneous predictions of our emotional reactions. Whereby, since we are focusing on the impact on one specific event, we simultaneously overestimate the intensity and duration of our emotional reaction to that event and underestimate the effect of other unrelated events. However, we fail to consider that these unrelated events can moderate our emotional responses.

=== Distinction bias ===
Cognitive bias whereby people focus too much on the differences between two future events instead of the shared features. This bias leads to the impact bias when people focus too much on a distinction that does affect their future happiness instead of focusing on features that do. As a result, people overestimate the impact of that difference on their wellbeing. For example, a study asked college students to predict how happy they would be a year later if assigned to a desired or undesired dormitory. Results showed that the students largely overestimated their unhappiness when assigned to an undesired dormitory, as their overall happiness was nearly identical to those living in desired houses the following year.

=== Sense-making ===
People fail to recognize how quickly they will make sense of an event, thereby, failing to anticipate the deceleration of emotional reactions. Research suggests that there are four processes by which our psychological immune system deals with unpredicted and poorly understood events: First, they pay a lot of attention to the event, then, they react emotionally, they attempt to make sense of the event, and finally, they adapt emotionally. Failure to recognize that these processes will occur or how fast they will occur causes people to overestimate the impact (and the duration of impact) of such events.

Immune Neglect:
We have unconscious psychological processes such as ego defense, dissonance reductions, self-serving biases, etc. that will cushion the effects of a negative event. When making predictions, people are generally unaware of these unconscious processes, and fail to take them into account when making affective forecasts.

== Consequences ==
In the context of decision-making, the impact bias has important consequences. When making decisions (ranging from deciding whether to move to California or not to deciding whether to bike or drive to work), people attempt to predict the outcome of their decisions by projecting their emotional reactions to future events (e.g.: “&quot;How will this make me feel?&quot;”). Thereby, they base their decisions on affective forecasts (Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2005). Erroneous projections about future emotional reactions, such as overestimating the intensity and durability of affect (i.e.: impact bias) can lead to mistaken projections. These mistakes impact decisions, and misguide people into making decisions that are not compatible with their future states and may be harmful to their wellbeing.

The impact bias can also result in error in recollecting memories. People display retrospective impact bias when they overestimate the intensity and duration of an emotional reaction to a past event. This can lead to errors in decision making because it can lead people overestimating how an event positively or negatively impacts their wellbeing. Furthermore, people are influenced by their current emotion when recalling their past emotions. This can explain why people do not learn from their mistakes, and make more accurate forecasts. This phenomenon can cause people to make irrational or unbalanced decisions because they recollect that an example was positive (or negative), but fail to recollect the degree of positive (or negative) effect, leading to an inaccurate cost-benefit analysis.

== Development in children ==
Recent evidence suggests that 3, 4 and 5 year-old children show an impact bias for the intensity of their negative future emotions, but not their positive future emotions.

<text>LTK Commune (aka LTK, Taiwanese: &quot;Lô-chúi-khoe Kong-siā&quot; 濁水溪公社) is a well-known Taiwanese &quot;underground&quot; band founded in 1990. Their music has been variously described as having elements of punk, rock, nakasi, Taiwanese folk songs. In recent years band members have self-consciously applied the label &quot;Taik&quot; (from &quot;Tai&quot;wanese + -k ending, as in &quot;punk&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;) to their music – a reference to the Taiwanese &quot;Taike&quot; (Trad.: 台客) subculture.

The &quot;LTK&quot; stands for &quot;Loh Tsui Kweh&quot;, an idiosyncratic spelling (in Taiwanese) of the name of the Choshui River in Taiwan, one that evokes nativist sentiments.

The two guitar players – Tsai Hai-en (蔡海恩) and Ke Jen-chien (柯仁堅) – share lead vocals. Both attended National Taiwan University but left school early. Between the two of them they have driven the band&#x27;s evolution. The critic Malaite attributes the group&#x27;s early grunge influence to Tsai. In addition to Western influences, both of them are, in their own ways, steeped in local, traditionally working class genres. There is also a bass player and a drummer.

LTK Commune&#x27;s earlier music echoes the island&#x27;s protest movements of the early 1990s. Earlier themes have consciously reflected environmentalist concerns and anti-authoritarian sentiments. With the decline of street protests and the onset of political liberalization, socially conscious themes have become less foregrounded. The band unabashedly supports Taiwan independence.

Their songs often express the frustration of the Taiwanese working class male. Unapologetically sexual or scatological references and vulgar language are found in some songs, a characteristic embraced by the fans but found outrageous by some critics. Some critics detect a streak of male chauvinism, most notably in the song &quot;Rape, Murder&quot;; others consider the song as a study of the perverse psyche of a rapist-murderer.

Much of the lyrics are in the native Taiwanese language, a choice consistent with the language&#x27;s working class base, as well as the anti-Kuomintang Opposition culture. Spoken monologues reminiscent of traditional melodrama (such as Budaixi, Taiwanese opera) are a favored device in their narratives.

LTK Commune&#x27;s live performances are noted for their spontaneity and engagement with the crowd.</text><links>

<text>In music theory, the bass note of a chord or sonority is the lowest note played or notated. If there are multiple voices it is the note played or notated in the lowest voice (the note furthest in the bass.)

Three situations are possible:

# The bass note is the root or fundamental of the chord. The chord is in root position.
# One of the other pitches of the chord is in the bass. This makes it an inverted chord
# The bass note is &quot;not&quot; one of the notes in the chord. Such a bass note is an additional note, coloring the chord above it. Such a chord is also called a slash chord.

In pre-tonal theory (Early music), root notes were not considered and thus the bass was the most defining note of a sonority. See: thoroughbass. In pandiatonic chords the bass often does not determine the chord, as is always the case with a nonharmonic bass.

<doc id="889605" wikidata="Q72429" url="?curid=889605" title="Judith Holofernes">
<text>Judith Holfelder-Roy (&quot;née&quot; Holfelder-von der Tann; born 12 November 1976), known by her stage name Judith Holofernes (), is a German singer, guitarist, songwriter and author.

She was the lead singer of Wir sind Helden, the German pop rock band that released the song &quot;Guten Tag&quot; in 2002. The band received critical acclaim owing in part to Holofernes&#x27; lyrics, which are characterized by their playful use of words and use of social criticism.

After recording four albums that were chart successes in the German-speaking world, Wir sind Helden went on indefinite hiatus in 2012. Since then, Holofernes has recorded two solo albums (&quot;Ein leichtes Schwert&quot;, 2014; &quot;Ich bin das Chaos&quot;, 2017) and has published a book of poems (&quot;Du bellst vor dem falschen Baum&quot;, 2015) and a memoir (&quot;Die Träume anderer Leute&quot;, 2022).

== Early life ==
Holofernes was born in Berlin and moved at the age of six with her mother to the city of Freiburg im Breisgau in the south of Germany. From the age of 14, she busked in the city&#x27;s pedestrian zone as a singer/guitarist. After she received her secondary education at Staudinger Gesamtschule, she returned to Berlin to study communication in Social and Economic Contexts at Berlin University of the Arts, but did not complete her studies. At the university, she was concerned with anti-consumerism, one of her activities being to set up the German website of Adbusters, a Canadian-based anti-consumerist magazine.

== Music career ==

=== Late nineties: Early endeavours ===
Holofernes was able to focus on music after leaving university. Towards the end of the nineties, she performed in Berlin clubs as a solo artist and self-released the EP &quot;Kamikazefliege&quot; (1999), though only 500 copies were produced. Some of the songs from the EP, such as &quot;Außer dir&quot; and &quot;Aurélie&quot;, would be later re-recorded by Wir sind Helden for the band&#x27;s debut album.

=== 2000–2012: Wir sind Helden ===
In mid-2000, Holofernes met drummer Pola Roy, keyboardist/guitarist Jean-Michel Tourette and bassist Stefan Nietzky at a pop music workshop in Hamburg. They formed a band together, though Nietzky was later replaced by bassist Mark Tavassol. The band was initially briefly called Helden (which means &quot;Heroes&quot;) before being renamed Wir sind Helden (which means &quot;We are heroes&quot;). Wir sind Helden&#x27;s breakthrough came in 2002 without the support of a record label, when the band&#x27;s song &quot;Guten Tag&quot; was played by radio stations and a self-produced music video for the song received heavy rotation on MTV Germany. The band subsequently signed to Labels and released its debut album &quot;Die Reklamation&quot; (2003), which was a top 5 hit in Germany and Austria and sold over half a million copies in Germany alone. The band went on to record the albums &quot;Von hier an blind&quot; (2005), &quot;Soundso&quot; (2007) and &quot;Bring mich nach Hause&quot; (2010), all of which reached high positions in the German, Austrian and Swiss charts. In April 2012, the band announced that it was taking an indefinite break owing to family commitments, the long distances between the band members&#x27; home cities, and &quot;signs of wear and tear&quot;.

=== 2012 to present: Post-Wir sind Helden career ===
During her break from Wir sind Helden, Holofernes began composing songs informally using Apple software application GarageBand and then later decided to record them in the studio, with herself on guitar, piano and ukulele, Roy on drums, and Jörg Holdinghausen from German band Tele on bass. The songs appear on her solo album &quot;Ein leichtes Schwert&quot;, which was released in February 2014 and charted at No. 7 in Germany. Holofernes&#x27; newest album, &quot;Ich bin das Chaos&quot;, was released in March 2017. For the album, Holofernes collaborated with the Faroese singer-songwriter Teitur Lassen and her husband Pola Roy who produced the album. In 2019, Holofernes joined the crowdfunding platform Patreon. She received support by the American artist Amanda Palmer who has been using crowdfunding to finance her work since 2012. On the platform, Holofernes, amongst other things, shares essays and episodes of her podcast &quot;Salon Holofernes&quot; in which she talks to various artists. Holofernes&#x27; memoir, &quot;Die Träume anderer Leute&quot;, was published in September 2022. In the book, Holofernes reflects on her experiences with the music industry, focussing primarily on her time as a solo artist since the hiatus of Wir sind Helden. Her general conclusion is that, while her solo career was enjoyable and to an extent successful, it has been &quot;overshadowed into&quot; a failure by her Wir Sind Helden era. This is also reflected in the fact that she mostly lives off the copyright of her old songs.

=== Collaborations ===
Holofernes&#x27; voice appears on the song &quot;X&quot; from the album &quot;Supporters&#x27; Album #1&quot; (2003) by German band Einstürzende Neubauten. She also sang background vocals for two songs by Tele on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Wovon sollen wir leben&quot; (2004). Further vocal contributions by Holofernes can be heard on the song &quot;Wir rühren uns nicht vom Fleck&quot; (2004) by German band Die Sterne and &quot;Armer Vater&quot; (2006) by German band Olli Schulz und der Hund Marie. Together with Swedish singer Moneybrother, she recorded the song &quot;Magic Moments&quot;, which appears on his album &quot;Mount Pleasure&quot; (2007). She has also collaborated with German band Die Höchste Eisenbahn, recording and performing the song &quot;Vergangenheit&quot; (2012), and with German singer Maxim, co-writing and recording the song &quot;Meine Soldaten&quot; (2013).

== Artistry ==

=== Stage name ===
Holofernes&#x27; stage name alludes to the Old Testament account of the beheading of Holofernes by Judith given in the &quot;Book of Judith&quot;. As a young teenager, Holofernes frequently heard the story of Judith and Holofernes from her uncles and aunts. She later decided in her late teens to use the two names to create her stage name. There is no historical evidence for the existence of a General Holofernes.

=== Lyrics ===
Holofernes was the lead singer and guitarist of Wir sind Helden, and also the writer of the lyrics for the band&#x27;s songs. She conveys her political opinions in many of her lyrics. For example, she criticizes consumerism in the song &quot;Guten Tag&quot;, a performance-oriented society in &quot;Müssen nur wollen&quot;, the music industry in &quot;Zuhälter&quot;, and a dog-eat-dog society in &quot;Konkurrenz&quot;. However, she has stated that politics are only one aspect of Wir sind Helden and that she is primarily a songwriter, writing love songs and songs of a whimsical nature with the same commitment as political songs. She is known for her playful use of words in the German language and has been described as a wordsmith in the tradition of German writers Robert Gernhardt and Christian Morgenstern. Songwriters that have had a major influence on Holofernes include Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello and Rio Reiser.

== Other activities ==
Holofernes maintains her own blog, where she has posted her opinions on topical issues, anecdotes from Kreuzberg (the area of Berlin where she lives), and &quot;Tiergedichte&quot; (animal poems). A collection of her &quot;Tiergedichte&quot; was published in October 2015 in her first sole-authored book, titled &quot;Du bellst vor dem falschen Baum&quot;. Her previous book was &quot;Wir sind Helden – Informationen zu Touren und anderen Einzelteilen&quot; (2008), a band autobiography written with the other members of Wir sind Helden.

In July 2011, Holofernes presented &quot;Summer of Girls&quot;, a season of programmes on French-German television channel arte concerning women in the pop music industry.

== Public image ==

=== Media appearances ===
Following the breakthrough of Wir sind Helden in 2002, the band received much attention from the media, including the quality newspapers, owing in part to Holofernes&#x27; sociocritical lyrics in songs such as &quot;Guten Tag&quot; and &quot;Müssen nur wollen&quot;. Holofernes subsequently became a much sought after personality for interviews and has appeared on German talk shows such as &quot;Die Harald Schmidt Show&quot;. In 2010, she made an appearance on political talk show &quot;Maybrit Illner&quot;, participating in a discussion titled &quot;Bürgeraufstand 2010 – regiert die Politik am Volk vorbei?&quot; (&quot;Civil uprising 2010 – are the people being ignored by politics?&quot;).

=== Activism ===
Holofernes lends her support to the Tibet Initiative, a German organization campaigning for human rights and self-determination in Tibet; Attac, a global organization seeking an alternative to neo-liberal globalization; and Viva con Agua, a German charity campaigning for clean drinking water worldwide. She is also a supporter of green issues; in 2011, she performed with the other members of Wir sind Helden at an anti-nuclear power demonstration in Berlin following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

=== Public criticism of the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper ===
In 2011, Holofernes had a public argument with advertising agency Jung von Matt when it asked her if she could participate in an advertising campaign for &quot;Bild&quot;, Germany&#x27;s most widely read tabloid, even though she had been critical of &quot;Bild&quot; in the past. She responded by posting an open letter on the Wir sind Helden website, where she criticized the campaign and &quot;Bild&quot;. At the end of the letter, she stated: &quot;The &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper is a dangerous political instrument: it&#x27;s not only a telescope which strongly magnifies into the abyss, but also a malicious entity which is not describing Germany, but shaping it instead – with an agenda.&quot; The letter attracted much attention, causing the Wir sind Helden website to go down. &quot;Bild&quot; subsequently reproduced the letter without Holofernes&#x27; consent in a single-page advertisement in German newspaper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, with a caption at the end thanking Holofernes for her honest and unpaid opinion.

== Personal life ==
Holofernes married Roy, fellow member of Wir sind Helden, in July 2006 and gave birth to their son in December of the same year. The couple had a second child, a daughter, in August 2009. Holofernes and Roy are both Buddhists; in 2007, she met the Dalai Lama.

She is a fan and also close friends with the singer Teitur. She owns a dog named Lupita. As of now, she does not agree with some of her old lyrics.

6 years ago, in 2018, due to a combination of work related stress and exhaustion, motherhood and meningitis, she practically lost her voice which was fragile from the beginning, susceptible to allergies, asthma and infections. Since 2022, she has been doing voice therapy and can sing along &quot;Dolly Parton and Joni Mitchell&quot;, though in a different pitch and tone than she used to.

It was one of the first of the Organized Reserve divisions to be called into federal service, created nearly &quot;from scratch&quot; after the implementation of the draft in 1940. Previous divisions were composed of a core of either Regular Army or National Guard personnel plus draftees. Much of the experience in reactivating it was used in the subsequent expansion of the U.S. Army.

By the end of World War II the 88th Infantry fought its way to the northernmost extreme of Italy. In early May 1945 troops of its 349th Infantry Regiment joined the 103d Infantry Division of the VI Corps of the U.S. Seventh Army, part of the 6th Army Group, which had raced south through Bavaria into Innsbruck, Austria, in Vipiteno in the Italian Alps.

===Composition===
Initial personnel for the division were Selective Service men from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and the division was at full strength of 20,000 by the end of September 1917. The 88th Division, like many National Army divisions, subsequently suffered heavily from transfers to other new units or units that were more advanced in their training and preparing to go overseas, delaying its combat readiness. In October 1917, 3,000 men were transferred to the 34th Division and 1,000 to the 33rd Division, while in November 8,000 went to the 87th Division. The strength of the 88th Division was only 8,000 men in January 1918, but the next month, 12,000 men arrived from Iowa and Minnesota to bring the division to full strength. Subsequently, 16,000 men were transferred from the division, the majority to the 82nd Division, and others to the 30th, 33rd, 35th and 90th Divisions. At the end of April, the 88th Division was left with less than 8,500 men, but during May and June more than 10,000 fresh drafts joined, many from Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota, and during July, more fresh drafts and transfers completed the division. The division sailed in stages to England in August and September 1918, and moved to France. Elements of the division participated in training near the front lines with the French Army, and occupied quiet sectors of the front in Alsace beginning in early October 1918. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the war a month later.

The division was composed of the following units:

* Headquarters, 88th Division
* 175th Infantry Brigade
** 349th Infantry Regiment
** 350th Infantry Regiment
** 338th Machine Gun Battalion
* 176th Infantry Brigade

*** 349th, 350th, 351st, and 352nd Ambulance Companies and Field Hospitals

==Interwar period==

The 88th Division headquarters arrived at the port of Newport News, Virginia, aboard the USS Pocahontas on 1 June 1919 and was demobilized on 10 June 1919 at Camp Dodge. Pursuant to the National Defense Act of 1920, the 88th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Seventh Corps Area, assigned to the XVII Corps, and further allotted to the states of Minnesota, Iowa, and North Dakota. The division headquarters was organized on 2 September 1921 at 1684 Van Buren Street in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was relocated to the Kasota Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 29 September 1921, to 835 Palace Building in August 1924, and to the new Post Office Building in July 1937, where it remained until activated for World War II. In the first years after World War I, many officers of the division were chaplains, doctors, engineers, or other men with prior military service commissioned directly from civilian life. As the 1920s turned to the 1930s, many of the World War I veteran officers began to retire, and the single largest cohort of officers in the division became college graduates from the Reserve Officers Training Corps. The primary sources for these new Reserve lieutenants were Coe College, the State University of Iowa, and Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in Iowa, the University of Minnesota in Minnesota, and North Dakota Agricultural College and the University of North Dakota in North Dakota.

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Dodge. For annual training the headquarters and staff usually trained with the staff of the 14th Infantry Brigade, either at Fort Crook, Nebraska, or Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The infantry regiments held their annual training primarily with the 3rd Infantry Regiment at Fort Snelling, or with the 17th Infantry Regiment at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Sixth and Seventh Corps Areas, often with the active units of the 7th Division or other Regular Army units. For example, the division artillery trained at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin; the 313th Engineer Regiment trained at Fort Riley, Kansas, with Troop A, 9th Engineer Squadron; the 313th Medical Regiment trained at the medical corps training camp at Fort Snelling; and the 313th Observation Squadron trained with the 16th Observation Squadron at Marshall Field, Kansas. The infantry regiments also rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Fort Snelling, Fort Des Moines, and Fort Lincoln, North Dakota, each year. The division sometimes participated in Seventh Corps Area and Fourth Army command post exercises with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units, but unlike the Regular and Guard units, the 88th Division did not participate in the Seventh Corps Area maneuvers and the Fourth Army maneuvers of 1937, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel. In the United States Army&#x27;s precautionary mobilization in 1940-1941 prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, most Organized Reserve officers were ordered to active duty individually and assigned to fill vacancies in existing or newly organized Regular Army and National Guard units. As a result, the 88th Division was almost completely depleted of personnel, particularly company-grade officers (lieutenants and captains).

===Activation and training===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 88th Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John E. Sloan, was ordered into active military service on 15 July 1942 at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma, around a cadre of officers and men from the 9th Infantry Division, National Guard and Organized Reserve officers, and men from infantry replacement training centers at Camp Wheeler, Georgia, and Camp Wolters, Texas. The first group of draftee fillers for the division arrived in early August, coming predominantly from New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Other groups, mainly from the Great Lakes and Midwest but also hailing from the Southwest and Far West, arrived in October and early November to round out the division.

The division was unique among U.S. Army infantry divisions during World War II in that it suffered relatively little from factors that caused personnel turbulence or other delays to the date on which it was judged to be &quot;ready&quot; for combat service and shipped to a theater of war. The Army&#x27;s officer candidate schools (OCS) expanded dramatically in scope in 1942. One requirement for entry was that men have at least six months of service in the Army; the majority of the 88th Infantry Division&#x27;s personnel did not become eligible for OCS until January 1943, around which time the Army reconsidered the troop basis, eliminating the need for many infantry officers as their future units were no longer contemplated for organization. OCS quotas in the combat arms were reduced dramatically until 1944. There was also little pressure for the division to provide candidates for the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), which went into operation early in 1943, as units on maneuvers or under alert orders were exempted from providing candidates. The 88th Infantry Division went on maneuvers in Louisiana beginning in June 1943 and was alerted for overseas movement in September, soon after completing them. The division also had not progressed far enough in its training to be a victim of the stripping of stateside units in 1942 to obtain men needed to fill out units slated for participation in the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942. In addition, it moved overseas just as the stripping of stateside units to fill emergency requirements and provide additional sources of trained replacements became a formalized policy beginning in fall 1943, resulting in near-continuous personnel losses to many units until late summer 1944. According to the Army Ground Forces, the 88th&#x27;s three sister divisions activated in July 1942, the 80th, 89th, and 95th, respectively lost seven, fourteen, and eight months of training time to personnel turbulence caused by withdrawal of ASTP/OCS candidates or time lost because of other factors not attributed to personnel turbulence.

===Combat chronicle===

*First Entered combat: Advance party on night of 3–4 January 1944 in support of Monte Cassino attacks.
*First Organization Committed to Line: 2nd Battalion, 351st Infantry Regiment plus attachments
*First combat fatality: 3 January 1944
*Began post war POW Command: 7 June 1945. Responsible for guarding and later repatriating 324,462 German POWs.

The 88th Infantry Division arrived at Casablanca, French Morocco on 15 December 1943, and moved to Magenta, Algeria, on 28 December for intensive training. Destined to spend the war fighting on the Italian Front, the division arrived at Naples, Italy on 6 February 1944, and concentrated around Piedimonte d&#x27;Alife for combat training. The 88th Infantry Division, along with the 85th Infantry Division, were the first United States Army divisions composed essentially entirely of draftees to enter combat. An advance element went into the line before Monte Cassino on 27 February, and the entire division relieved the battered British 46th Infantry Division along the Garigliano River in the Minturno area on 5 March. A period of defensive patrols and training followed. The 88th formed part of Major General Geoffrey Keyes&#x27;s II Corps, part of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark.

After being inspected by the Fifth Army commander on 5 May, the 88th Division, six days later, drove north to take Spigno, Mount Civita, Itri, Fondi, and Roccagorga, reached Anzio, 29 May, and pursued the enemy into Rome, being the first unit of the Fifth Army into the city on 4 June, two days before the Normandy landings, after a stiff engagement on the outskirts of the city. An element of the 88th is credited with being first to enter the Eternal City. After continuing across the Tiber to Bassanelio the 88th retired for rest and training, 11 June. The division went into defensive positions near Pomerance on 5 July, and launched an attack toward Volterra on the 8th, taking the town the next day. Laiatico fell on the 11th, Villamagna on the 13th, and the Arno River was crossed on the 20th although the enemy resisted bitterly.

After a period of rest and training, the 88th Division, now commanded by Major General Paul Wilkins Kendall, opened its assault on the Gothic Line on 21 September, and advanced rapidly along the Firenzuola-Imola road, taking Monte Battaglia (Casola Valsenio, RA) in the Battle of Monte Battaglia on the 28th. The enemy counterattacked savagely and heavy fighting continued on the line toward the Po Valley. The strategic positions of Mount Grande and Farnetto were taken on 20 and 22 October. From 26 October 1944 to 12 January 1945, the 88th entered a period of defensive patrolling in the Mount Grande-Mount Cerrere sector and the Mount Fano area. From 24 January to 2 March 1945, the division defended the Loiano-Livergnano area and after a brief rest returned to the front. The drive to the Po Valley began on 15 April. Monterumici fell on the 17th after an intense artillery barrage and the Po River was crossed at Revere-Ostiglia on 24-25 April, as the 88th pursued the enemy toward the Alps. The cities of Verona and Vicenza were captured on the 25th and 28th and the Brenta River was crossed on 30 April. The 88th was driving through the Dolomite Alps toward Innsbruck, Austria where it linked up with the 103rd Infantry Division, part of the U.S. Seventh Army, when the hostilities ended on 2 May 1945. The end of World War II in Europe came six days later. Throughout the war the 88th Infantry Division was in combat for 344 days.

==Post war==
After the war, the 88th Infantry Division absorbed some personnel and units from the 34th Infantry Division and served on occupation duty in Italy guarding the Morgan Line from positions in Italy and Trieste until 15 September 1947 when the Italian peace treaty came into force. The 351st Infantry was relieved from assignment to the division on 1 May 1947 and served as temporary military Government of the Free Territory of Trieste, securing the new independent State between Italy and Yugoslavia on behalf of the United Nations Security Council. Designated TRUST (Trieste United States Troops), the command served as the front line in the Cold War from 1947 to 1954, including confrontations with Yugoslavian forces. 
In October 1954 the mission ended upon the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding of London establishing a temporary civil administration in the Anglo-American Zone of the Free Territory of Trieste, entrusted to the responsibility of the Italian Government. 
TRUST units, which included a number of 88th divisional support units, all bore a unit patch which was the coat of arms of the Free Territory of Trieste superimposed over the divisional quatrefoil, over which was a blue scroll containing the designation &quot;TRUST&quot; in white.
==Cold War and beyond==
The 88th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) was formed at Fort Snelling in January 1968, as one of 18 ARCOMs which were organized to provide command and control to Army Reserve units. The initial area of responsibility for the 88th ARCOM included Minnesota and Iowa, and this area was later expanded to include Wisconsin. Army Reserve Commands were authorized to use the number and shoulder sleeve insignia of infantry divisions with the same number. However, ARCOMs did not inherit the lineage and honors of the divisions because it was against Department of the Army policy for a Table of Distribution and Allowances organization, such as an ARCOM, to perpetuate the lineage and honors of a Table of Organization and Equipment formation, like the 88th Infantry Division.

In 1996, when the Army Reserve&#x27;s command structure was revised, the 88th Regional Support Command (88th RSC) was established at Fort Snelling. Its mission was to command and control Army Reserve units in a six state region, which included Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. In addition, the 88th RSC ensured operational readiness, provided area support services, and supported emergency operations in its area of responsibility.

In 2003, the Army Reserve&#x27;s command structure was again revised, and the 88th Regional Readiness Command (88th RRC) was formed at Fort Snelling with responsibility for USAR units in the same six states included in the 88th RSC. Various Combat Support units mobilize and deploy to Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2003-mid 2004.

In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Fort Snelling, MN by disestablishing the 88th Regional Readiness Command. This recommendation was part of a larger recommendation to re-engineer and streamline the Command and Control structure of the Army Reserve that would create the Northwest Regional Readiness Command at Fort McCoy, WI.

In 2008, the 88th Regional Readiness Command (88th RRC) moved to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. The mission was changed to provide base operations support to the new 19 state region, Welcome Home Warrior ceremonies, and the Yellow Ribbon weekends. The units assigned to the 88th RSC include 6 Army Reserve Bands and the Headquarters Company. It may supervise the 643rd Area Support Group at Whitehall, Ohio.

=== Operation Allies Welcome ===
The 88th was ordered to support Operation Allies Refuge in August 2021 as the core of Task Force McCoy. From August 2021 until February 2022, the task force assisted in feeding, housing, clothing, and providing assistance to the more than 12,600 Afghans resettling in the United States. Major subordinate elements of the task force included the Fort Mccoy Garrison, the 181st Infantry Brigade, 302nd Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, 720th MP Battalion, and the 1st Squadron, 32nd Cavalry.

==Current==

The division shoulder patch is worn by the United States Army Reserve 88th Readiness Division at Fort Snelling, Minnesota; the division lineage is perpetuated by the 88th RD. RDs such as the 88th have the same number as inactivated divisions and are allowed to wear the shoulder patch, and division lineage and honors are inherited by an RD.

==General==
*Shoulder patch: A blue (for Infantry) quatrefoil, formed by two Arabic numeral &quot;8s&quot;. A rocker above it with the nickname &quot;Blue Devils&quot; was often worn.
*During World War II, the Germans thought the 88th was an elite stormtrooper Division. This was most likely due to parallels between the &quot;Blue Devil&quot; nickname and patch rocker and the German SS&#x27;s use of the Totenkopf death&#x27;s head insignia.

<text>Eucinetidae is a family of beetles, notable for their large coxal plates that cover much of the first ventrite of the abdomen, sometimes called plate-thigh beetles. The family is small for beetles, with about 50 species in 11 genera, but are found worldwide.

Adults are generally elliptical in shape, ranging from 0.8 to 4.0 mm in length, and black or brown in color. The head is small and bent underneath.

Eucinetids live in detritus or in fungus-covered tree bark, where both adults and larvae are assumed to eat various sorts of fungi. Around half of the genera possess strongly modified mouthparts, particularly the labrum, adapted for suctorial feeding.

==Genera==
These genera belong to the family Eucinetidae:
* &quot;Eucinetella&quot;
* &quot;Eucinetus&quot; 
* &quot;Euscaphurus&quot; 
* &quot;Noteucinetus&quot; 
* &quot;Nycteus&quot; 
* &quot;Peltocoleops&quot; 
* &quot;Subulistomella&quot; 
* †&quot;Huaxiacinectus&quot; Huachi-Huanhe Formation, China, Early Cretaceous (Hauterivian)
* Suctorial clade:
** &quot;Eucilodes&quot; 
** †&quot;Cretohlezkus&quot; Burmese amber, Myanmar, mid Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian)
** &quot;Bisaya&quot; 
** &quot;Jentozkus&quot;

<text>The Tiki Ti is a Polynesian-themed tiki bar on Sunset Boulevard, in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles.

Established in 1961 by Ray Buhen, the Tiki Ti&#x27;s only employees, Mike Sr. and Mike Jr. Buhen are also the sole owners. The establishment is only open part of the week, closing instead on Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays. The bar is a well known stop as an underground landmark, often serving as a prelude stop before attending other clubs in the popular Silverlake/Hollywood area. The bartenders are known for their &quot;heavy&quot; pours and specialty drinks like the &quot;Blood and Sand,&quot; where patrons synchronously yell &quot;Toro, Toro, Toro&quot; while the drink is topped off with tequila, an homage to the 1941 Tyrone Power film about bullfighting. The other chanting drink is the &quot;Uga Booga&quot; where patrons yell &quot;ooga booga&quot; as the drink is being prepared. 

The Tiki Ti does not have a happy hour, but on Wednesdays the &quot;Ray&#x27;s Mistake&quot; cocktail is reduced in price. Also on that day, Mike will raise a toast to his father, Ray Buhen. The strongest drink is purported to be the &quot;Stealth.&quot;

Although the Tiki-Ti does not serve typical bar cocktails such as the martini, the cosmopolitan or beer, their drink menu does consist of over 80 exotic drinks—many of which are originals. Drink names are colorful and include Yellow Bird, Laka Nuki, Bayanihan, Bonnie &amp; Clyde and the Missionary&#x27;s Downfall, just to name a few. For those who cannot decide what drink to choose, the bar offers a wheel that patrons can spin to help them make up their mind.

<text>Honey Nut Cheerios is a variation of Cheerios breakfast cereal, introduced in 1979. Honey Nut Cheerios has a honey and almond flavor, making it sweeter than the original. While Honey Nut Cheerios used to be made with actual nuts, as of 2006, the nuts were discontinued, and natural flavor from peach and apricot pit is used instead . In 2011, Honey Nut Cheerios was the best-selling cereal in the United States.

Honey Nut Cheerios was the third variation of Cheerios introduced; Cinnamon Nut Cheerios was test marketed in 1976. There have been many other Cheerios variations, including Maple Cheerios, Chocolate Cheerios, Frosted Cheerios and Blueberry Cheerios.

==History==

Historically, Honey Nut Cheerios has participated in much the same promotional advertising as the original brand, while collaborating with the field of NASCAR and especially driver Bill Lester, in promoting healthy diets. In 1985, Baskin-Robbins introduced an ice cream flavor based on the cereal called Honey Nut Crunch. Promotional tie-ins included gift certificates in cereal boxes and special Honey Nut Crunch sundaes in stores. The first 7 series of Honey Nut Cheerios did not have the bee mascot on the box, It was not until series 8 that the bee appeared on the box. Cereal boxes from 1979 without the bee are called &#x27;pre-bee&#x27; and are very rare.

General Mills has been active in the conservation of bees since 2011; in 2011, the company began investing in the Xerces Society to help promote biodiversity and pollinator conservation. In March 2017, General Mills announced the Buzz Bee image had been removed from boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios. Images of the new box showed a white empty space where Buzz Bee used to be. Below the image of the bowl of cereal, a plea to &quot;Help Bring Back The Bees&quot; was added. This was to raise awareness of pollinator decline. In the announcement, General Mills made note that 30% of ingredients they use depend on pollinators, and that the company plans to expand their pollinator habitat to 3,300 acres. As part of the campaign, 1.5 billion packets of wildflower seeds were included in boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios.

This campaign has struck controversy in some environmental communities. Kathryn Turner, an ecologist, commented that the packages of seeds contain species that are invasive to some geographic locations, and urged individuals to become more educated before planting the seeds.

==Mascot and promotions==

Honey Nut Cheerios&#x27; mascot is an anthropomorphic bee, designed for the first commercials by Dean Yeagle at Zander&#x27;s Animation Parlour in New York City. The bee did not have a name until 2000, when Kristine Tong, a fifth grade student from Coolidge, Texas, won a national contest to name him, dubbing him &quot;BuzzBee&quot;. Several different voice actors have provided the voice of Buzz: originally voiced by Arnold Stang until 1992, he was then voiced by Hadley Kay, Billy West, George Trahanis, Charlie Schlatter, Jason Marsden, Oliver Wyman, Sam Heyn and Travis Moscinski. Buzz appeared as the host in the Honey Nut Cheerios Spelling Bee board game.

==Taglines==

Many of this cereal&#x27;s taglines overlapped with each other. They were used on different advertisements.

* It&#x27;s a honey of an O. (1979–2004)
* It&#x27;s Honey Nut Cheerios! (1979–1992; 2000–2004; 2014–Present)
* It&#x27;s Irrezzzzistable! (1992–1993)
* Race for the taste! (1993–1995)
* Little O, Big Taste! (1995–1999)
* Nobody can say &quot;No&quot; to Honey Nut Cheerios. (1995–2004)
* From the hive that&#x27;s nuts about honey! (2004–2008)
* Bee happy, Bee healthy! (2004–2013)
* Must Be the Honey. (2013–Present, based on Nelly&#x27;s &quot;Ride wit Me&quot;)
* Good Goes Round. (2016–Present)
* Have a Change of Heart. (2022–Present)

==Nutrition==

Honey Nut Cheerios maintains most of the same health claims as the original Cheerios, due to its soluble fiber. Package nutritional information asserts that &quot;three grams of soluble fiber daily from whole grain oat foods, like Honey Nut Cheerios, in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease . Honey Nut Cheerios has 0.75g per serving.&quot; As with Cheerios, the American Heart Association certified the cereal as &quot;heart-healthy&quot; for meeting the food criteria for saturated fat and cholesterol content.

Honey Nut Cheerios also contains more sugar (9.6 Grams/serving) than original Cheerios, which contain 1.2 Grams/serving. This sugar comes from brown sugar, molasses, and honey.

<doc id="889630" wikidata="Q14687059" url="?curid=889630" title="Gospel Hump Wilderness">
<text>The Gospel Hump Wilderness is a federally-protected wilderness area that covers of the state of Idaho. Managed by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it received wilderness designation on February 24, 1978 through the passage of the Endangered American Wilderness Act and is part of Nez Perce National Forest. As part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, the Gospel Hump Wilderness is an area where human development and use are restricted and people are to remain only visitors.

==History==
The Nez Perce people lived in Idaho as early as 6000 BCE, and the area that is now the Gospel Hump Wilderness was used by them long before the arrival of settlers. In 1861 gold was discovered in Florence, Idaho, just outside the wilderness&#x27;s boundary. A quartz vein at the base of Buffalo Hump was discovered in 1898, which sparked a gold rush before mining subsided in 1903. Remnants of mines and other structures remain in the wilderness. The wilderness was formally established on February 24, 1978 when Congress passed Public Law 95-237.

==Management==
When the Gospel Hump Wilderness is combined with the adjacent Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area and the surrounding unprotected inventoried roadless area, it is part of a wilderness-roadless area complex. To the north of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area lies the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area. These two large Wilderness areas are separated only by a single dirt road (the Magruder Corridor), connecting Red River, Idaho to Darby, Montana. Negating the Magruder Corridor, the Selway-Bitterroot, Gospel Hump and Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Areas constitute the largest intact piece of wildland in the United States outside of Alaska.

A management plan was established in 1983 and provides guidance for the Forest Service on management of the wilderness. The Wilderness Act of 1964 enhanced the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage of the act ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or extraction, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter wilderness areas is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, just as they are throughout the Nez Perce National Forest, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits.

==Recreation==
There are no roads in the wilderness, and motorized vehicles are prohibited. However, several unpaved roads provide access to the wilderness, but are usually only accessible during the summer months. No permits are required for recreational visits, but group size is limited to 20 people and 20 head of stock and there is a fourteen-day limit for camping at one site.

In 1982 it was estimated that the wilderness had 29,000 recreation visitor days. Half of summer use is from hikers, half of which camp in the wilderness. The majority of visitors during the fall are hunters.

==Geography and geology==
Elevations in the wilderness range from at the Wind River pack bridge across the Salmon River to at the summit of Buffalo Hump. The Salmon River forms the southern border of the wilderness and separates it from the adjacent Frank Church—River of No Return Wilderness. Several alpine lakes are located in high-elevation basins below the mountain peaks in the wilderness.

Rock units in the wilderness include gneiss along the Salmon River, the Hood Quartzite and Yellowjacket Formation (Precambrian in age), and undifferentiated granite of the Idaho Batholith.

==Natural Resources==

The southern section of the wilderness is dry and sparsely forested, while the northern section is moist and heavily forested. Mean annual precipitation ranges from along the Salmon River to at higher elevations, and snowpacks can reach at higher elevations. At lower elevations ponderosa pine and cheat grass dominate, while higher elevations are covered by lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, and whitebark pine along with whortleberry and beargrass. The two parts of the wilderness are separated by the mountain divide for which the wilderness is named. Fish present in the wilderness include sockeye salmon, chinook salmon, rainbow trout, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, and smallmouth bass. Elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, black bears, mountain lions, mountain goats, gray wolves, moose, and bighorn sheep are large mammals found in the wilderness. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, provided proper permits are obtained in the appropriate season.

<doc id="889632" wikidata="Q8023913" url="?curid=889632" title="WindTunnel with Dave Despain">
<text>WindTunnel with Dave Despain was a live viewer call-in show exclusively for auto racing fans that debuted on Speed Channel on February 22, 2003, and ended on August 11, 2013. During the course of the show, host Dave Despain fielded telephone calls and read e-mail from viewers, some of them directed at the guest Despain is interviewing, which was done just after the first segment, titled &quot;Hot Topics&quot;, which Despain reads the big stories from the racing world. After the interview segment, Despain did a segment just for him, titled &quot;My Take&quot;, in which he gave his opinion on news from the racing world. There was also an award for the best e-mail or phone call from each show, as the winning viewer received a Despain bobblehead. It was a coveted prize among viewers.

When &quot;WindTunnel&quot; debuted, the show aired Friday nights at 11 pm. The pilot episode was only a half-hour long. The time length was changed to an hour the very next week. In August 2003, &quot;WindTunnel&quot; expanded to four nights a week (Monday-Thursday) and moved to a 9 pm timeslot. In 2005, to the chagrin of some of the series&#x27; fans, &quot;WindTunnel&quot; was scaled back to one night a week, airing for two hours beginning at 9 pm on Sunday nights. In 2006, &quot;WindTunnel&quot; was scaled back to one hour. There have been special episodes of WindTunnel shown as part of the lead-up to the Daytona 500 and the Sprint All-Star Race.

The 2006 season brought about guest co-hosts in the form of racing personalities like drivers (such as Tony Stewart, Mario Andretti) and journalists (such as David Hobbs, Robin Miller, Ed Hinton, and Bob Varsha). In 2009, Despain began to take breaks during the season; guest hosts such as Krista Voda, Tommy Kendall, and Robin Miller have presented the show while Despain was off. Before this, only Ralph Sheheen in 2004 had replaced Despain for an episode due to illness.

The show would take a hiatus following the last NASCAR Sprint Cup race to late January during the racing off-season. During this time, best-of episodes titled &quot;WindTunnel: The Interviews&quot; were shown. Only the most popular interviews from the previous season were shown, which included interviews with NASCAR great Richard Petty, NASCAR star Jeff Gordon, and drag racing legend John Force. Starting in 2009 Golden Corral, an American restaurant chain, became the show&#x27;s sponsor. Previous sponsors have been Carquest, an automobile parts store chain in 2007, and Alltel, a cell phone company in 2008.

==Programming segments==
*Hot Topics-Highlights from the weekend&#x27;s races and motorsports news.
*Super 7 Sweep - An online fantasy racing game that awarded autographed Dave Despain Bobbleheads to each weekly winner plus season&#x27;s end championship prizes.
*Fired Up (2006-2012) – A short segment with callers (via voice mail) expressing heated opinions about topics regarding motorsports.
*Eye Candy – A high energy musical video package including clips from that weekend&#x27;s races.
*My Take – A short editorial segment where Despain offers his opinion on a controversial topic in motorsports, usually offering a potentially simple solution to a complex problem.
*Stat Rat (debuted July 15, 2007) - A reference of statistics regarding the performance of a team, driver, or manufacturer over a specific time period. While not a regular segment, it is used to highlight a guest&#x27;s achievements.
*Last Call – The last call from a viewer or a driver. Last call is announced by a graphic of what is likely intended to be an Italian bartender, but fans call him the &quot;pizza guy&quot; saying he looks like a worker in a pizza restaurant and that his long sleeves would get wet if he were a bartender. Despain counters, &quot;Why would a pizza guy be saying &quot;last call!&quot;?
*WindTunnel EXTRA (2009–2012) – An extra 30-minute program that starts immediately after the television broadcast, available on Speed Channel web site. Despain often does a second &quot;My Take&quot; on a different subject. It is not unusual for a guest from the broadcast to remain for the webcast. Despain often answers questions from the live interactive chat that runs concurrent with the show.
*Dave&#x27;s Favorite E-Mail (2010–2012) – Dave reads and reacts to his favorite user-submitted e-mail of the week, usually of a comedic or satirical nature.
*Help Yourself to Happiness – Sponsored by restaurant chain, Golden Corral. Dave highlights a particular moment or event of the previous week in which a racer &quot;helps them-self to happiness.&quot; Usually features a dramatic or meaningful overtaking maneuver.
*Question of the Week - Sponsored by RACER Magazine, Dave asks viewers to respond via phone or e-mail to a particular question. Usually relates to a &quot;Hot Topic&quot; or to a guest of the show.

<doc id="889638" wikidata="Q3423624" url="?curid=889638" title="Registered Traveler">
<text>A registered traveler is a person qualified through an airline passenger security assessment system in the United States air travel industry. Such programs were initially tested in 2005. Registered traveler programs are currently in operation in various airports around the country and are administered by TTAC, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) office responsible for Secure Flight, the replacement for the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) and the canceled CAPPS II counter-terrorism system.

Registered Traveler is a public and private partnership between the TSA and the Registered Traveler Interoperability Consortium (RTIC), providing rules and standards for private enrollment providers that sign up participants. The largest registered traveler program is called Clear and is operated by Clear Secure, Inc. The Clear Access Clearance Service is currently operating at 60 airports, airports, stadiums, and other venues nationwide as of January 2020.

==Overview==
The program seeks to identify passengers who pose a minimal security risk and then provide those passengers with an improvised security checkpoint process. Passengers will voluntarily pay a fee and submit to a background check to become registered travelers. Passengers who pass the background check will be issued a smartcard credential for use at the security checkpoints of airports that participate in the program. Registered travelers will have access to a reserved security lane and will experience a shorter wait at the security checkpoint. Other benefits, such as allowing registered travelers to keep their coats and shoes on and their laptops in their bags, have also been discussed. Any U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident over the age of 18 can apply for membership, as can minors over the age of 12 with parental or guardian sponsorship.

In order to prevent a terrorist with a clean background from compromising the system, the TSA requires that registered travelers undergo the normal TSA screening (baggage x-ray and personal metal detector) at the RT kiosk checkpoint. Additionally, registered Travelers are not exempt from random secondary screening and may not bring prohibited items into secure areas of terminals.

== Airports ==
These airports operated the Clear Registered Traveler program until June 2009, and currently other Registered Traveler programs:
*Albany International Airport (ALB)
*Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG), Terminal 3

The following airports have expressed interest and/or have requested TSA approval for the RT program:
*Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)
*Birmingham International Airport (BHM)
*Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW)

*Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)
*O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD)
*Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT)
*Springfield-Branson National Airport (SGF)
*Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC)

== Programs ==
The Registered Traveler programs are interoperable; someone who is registered with one RT program can participate in programs operated by other providers.

===Clear===
Clear, operated by Verified Identity Pass, was the largest registered traveler program participant, with almost 200,000 members. Clear was founded by Steven Brill, the founder of Court TV. Clear had programs at Albany, Cincinnati, Denver, Dulles Washington D.C., Indianapolis, Little Rock, New York LaGuardia, New York JFK, Newark, Oakland, Orlando, Reagan Washington D.C., Salt Lake City, San Jose, San Francisco, and Westchester Airports.

On July 26, 2008, a laptop containing the names, addresses, birth dates, driver&#x27;s license numbers, and passport information of 33,000 Clear customers was reported stolen from a secured room in San Francisco International Airport. The information was on an unencrypted laptop, in contravention of TSA rules, although it was protected by two levels of password protection.

As a result of the theft, TSA officials ordered Clear to inform affected customers, suspend enrollment of new customers, and cease the use of unencrypted computers, as well as secure devices until encryption can be installed, as required by TSA rules. Verified Identity Pass must submit an independent audit of its systems to the TSA before the company can register new customers.

On August 4, 2008, TSA Suspends Verified Identity Pass, Inc. Clear Registered Traveler Enrollment.

On August 5, 2008, the laptop was found in the same room where it went missing. Officials are currently investigating whether any personal data was accessed as well as the circumstances of the reappearance.

On June 22, 2009, Clear announced they would cease operations effective immediately, citing the inability of Verified Identity Pass, Inc. to obtain the necessary financing. The entire contents of Clear&#x27;s Web site were removed, and most pages were redirected to this statement: 

Clear Lanes Are No Longer Available.

At 11:00 p.m. PST on June 22, 2009, Clear will cease operations. Clear’s parent company, Verified Identity Pass, Inc. has been unable to negotiate an agreement with its senior creditor to continue operations. 
On July 6, 2009, two law firms filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of customers of Clear&#x27;s parent company, Verified Identity Pass, Inc., that suddenly shut down on June 22.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Verified Identity Pass Inc. by Schneider Wallace Cottrell Brayton Konecky LLP and Kaplan Fox. The suit claims that by ceasing operations and not offering refunds, VIP committed conversion, fraud, breach of contract, negligence, and unjust enrichment. Additional lawsuits since have focused on demanding the return or destruction of personal information, social security numbers, credit card numbers, fingerprints, and iris scans in addition to refunding membership fees.

On April 16, 2010, Judge Stuart M. Bernstein of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan granted approval to Alclear LLC to purchase the CLEAR assets after outbidding rival Henry Inc.

On May 3, 2010, Verified Identity Pass was purchased by Alclear LLC. Alclear LLC has brought Clear back and honored the time left on all of Clear&#x27;s original customers whose membership may have been terminated before the end of their contracts. In November 2010, Clear re-opened in Denver and Orlando airports.

, Clear is operational in nineteen cities.

===iQueue===
FLO Corporation has partnered with Cogent and iQueue to deliver RT solutions and services. They expected to bring back the Registered Traveler program in the &quot;Fall of 2010,&quot; starting with Indianapolis International Airport, with further expansions planned after. The website still exists (flyiqueue.com), but the registered traveler enrollment is not as yet operational.

====FLO====
The FLO Corporation, in conjunction with FLO Alliance partners, provides biometric identification technologies and credentialing processes for use in airports in accordance with the Registered Traveler program. Final enrollment centers are located in the Washington, D.C. area, or by on-location appointment for corporate accounts.

====RtGo====
RtGo was operated by Unisys Corporation (it had been bought out by FLO and was being operated by IRAM Associates). Membership was $100 per year, with the option to prepay for up to 5 years. Shortly after the buyout, the company went out of business and was shut down in July 2009.

===Preferred Traveler===
The Preferred Traveler program is run by Vigilant Solutions, a Jacksonville Beach-based company. The company&#x27;s program differentiates itself by adding a suite of value-added services for the traveler.

==Identifying information==

Passengers who participate in this system must first provide personal biographical information including name, address, phone number, citizenship status, and previous addresses, along with other information. The biographical information will be collected by a commercial Registered Traveler service provider. The biographical portion of the enrollment may be accomplished via a secure website. Next, the applicant will proceed to the biometric phase of the enrollment process. During biometric enrollment applicants will present identification documents and fingerprints. Applicants may also choose to have an image of their iris taken if they wish to use an iris image as an alternative to a fingerprint scan at the security checkpoint. The iris image is non-invasive to the eye. Once the biometric enrollment is complete, the service provider submits the collected data to the TSA which performs a Security Threat Assessment (STA) of the applicant. If the assessment does not indicate that the applicant is suspected of posing a risk to aviation security, the TSA will return an approved STA result to the service provider. The service provider will then provide the passenger with a Registered Traveler card. The card will be a smartcard, containing biometric information to prevent the card from being used by unauthorized persons. This card will then be inserted into a verification kiosk at the special checkpoints, which will verify the passenger&#x27;s biometrics (fingerprint or iris scan) and acknowledge membership and clearance to proceed to RT screening.

==Controversy==

===Privacy===

This system, like the related Secure Flight, has come under fire for its privacy implications although less so because Registered Traveler unlike Secure Flight is voluntary. The potential effectiveness has also been questioned. On the privacy front Registered Traveler collects far more information than Secure Flight including biometrics. While supporters assert that this program is voluntary, critics assert that RT&#x27;s extensive background checks will be misused. The privacy safeguards and rules can be found in the RTIC specification and the TSA RT Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). Many airports and airlines already offer access to shorter &quot;priority&quot; security lines to first-class or other status travelers without requiring any background checks.

===Effectiveness===

Similar to the concerns raised about CAPPS and CAPPS II, critics point out that any program designed to exclude certain passengers from scrutiny will provide a backdoor for potential terrorists, since they would likely seek Registered Traveler status. This criticism draws on the 9/11 Commission&#x27;s finding that nine of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11, 2001 attacks were flagged by the CAPPS I system but were not intercepted, because security was focused on luggage bombs. However, those participating in the Registered Traveler Program currently pass through the same security checkpoints and are screened the same as any other individual, the main difference being RT members enjoy a much shorter wait before screening. Currently, RT programs do not offer a reduced security check, but their announced plans indicate they intend to offer this if airport officials allow it.

===Fairness===
Because the Registered Travelers Program, in its current form, does not exempt members from any of the security checks of the TSA, it is often criticized as merely being a method by which frequent travelers can pay an annual fee to a private company in order to be permitted to move to the head of the TSA line and not wait their turn along with less frequent travelers. Since the TSA lines are a government program (funded by equal payments on tickets of frequent travelers and non-travelers), this strikes many as being unfair to less frequent travelers.

<doc id="889639" wikidata="Q842421" url="?curid=889639" title="Default logic">
<text>Default logic is a non-monotonic logic proposed by Raymond Reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions.

Default logic can express facts like “by default, something is true”; by contrast, standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false. This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always. A classical example is: “birds typically fly”. This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified. Default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions.

==Syntax of default logic==
A default theory is a pair formula_1. is a set of logical formulas, called &quot;the background theory&quot;, that formalize the facts that are known for sure. is a set of &quot;default rules&quot;, each one being of the form:

: formula_2

According to this default, if we believe that is true, and each formula_3 for formula_4 is consistent with our current beliefs, we are led to believe that is true.

The logical formulae in and all formulae in a default were originally assumed to be first-order logic formulae, but they can potentially be formulae in an arbitrary formal logic. The case in which they are formulae in propositional logic is one of the most studied.

===Examples===
The default rule “birds typically fly” is formalized by the following default:

:formula_5

This rule means that, &quot;if is a bird, and it can be assumed that it flies, then we can conclude that it flies&quot;. A background theory containing some facts about birds is the following one:

:formula_6.

According to this default rule, a condor flies because the precondition is true and the justification is not inconsistent with what is currently known. On the contrary, does not allow concluding : even if the precondition of the default is true, the justification is inconsistent with what is known. From this background theory and this default, cannot be concluded because the default rule only allows deriving from , but not vice versa. Deriving the antecedents of an inference rule from the consequences is a form of explanation of the consequences, and is the aim of abductive reasoning.

A common default assumption is that what is not known to be true is believed to be false. This is known as the Closed-World Assumption, and is formalized in default logic using a default like the following one for every fact .

: formula_7

For example, the computer language Prolog uses a sort of default assumption when dealing with negation: if a negative atom cannot be proved to be true, then it is assumed to be false.
Note, however, that Prolog uses the so-called negation as failure: when the interpreter has to evaluate the atom formula_8, it tries to prove that {{mvar|F}} is true, and conclude that formula_8 is true if it fails. In default logic, instead, a default having formula_8 as a justification can only be applied if formula_8 is consistent with the current knowledge.

===Restrictions===
A default is categorical or prerequisite-free if it has no prerequisite (or, equivalently, its prerequisite is tautological). A default is normal if it has a single justification that is equivalent to its conclusion. A default is supernormal if it is both categorical and normal. A default is seminormal if all its justifications entail its conclusion. A default theory is called categorical, normal, supernormal, or seminormal if all defaults it contains are categorical, normal, supernormal, or seminormal, respectively.

==Semantics of default logic==
A default rule can be applied to a theory if its precondition is entailed by the theory and its justifications are all consistent with the theory. The application of a default rule leads to the addition of its consequence to the theory. Other default rules may then be applied to the resulting theory. When the theory is such that no other default can be applied, the theory is called an extension of the default theory. The default rules may be applied in different order, and this may lead to different extensions. The Nixon diamond example is a default theory with two extensions:

:formula_12

Since Nixon is both a Republican and a Quaker, both defaults can be applied. However, applying the first default leads to the conclusion that Nixon is not a pacifist, which makes the second default not applicable. In the same way, applying the second default we obtain that Nixon is a pacifist, thus making the first default not applicable. This particular default theory has therefore two extensions, one in which {{math|Pacifist(Nixon)}} is true, and one in which {{math|Pacifist(Nixon)}} is false.

The original semantics of default logic was based on the fixed point of a function. The following is an equivalent algorithmic definition. If a default contains formulae with free variables, it is considered to represent the set of all defaults obtained by giving a value to all these variables. A default formula_13 is applicable to a propositional theory {{mvar|T}} if formula_14 and all theories formula_15 are consistent. The application of this default to {{mvar|T}} leads to the theory formula_16. An extension can be generated by applying the following algorithm:

 T = W /* current theory */
 A = 0 /* set of defaults applied so far */
 /* apply a sequence of defaults */
 while there is a default d that is not in A and is applicable to T
 add the consequence of d to T
 add d to A
 /* final consistency check */
 if 
 for every default d in A
 T is consistent with all justifications of d
 then
 output T

This algorithm is non-deterministic, as several defaults can alternatively be applied to a given theory {{mvar|T}}. In the Nixon diamond example, the application of the first default leads to a theory to which the second default cannot be applied and vice versa. As a result, two extensions are generated: one in which Nixon is a pacifist and one in which Nixon is not a pacifist.

The final check of consistency of the justifications of all defaults that have been applied implies that some theories do not have any extensions. In particular, this happens whenever this check fails for every possible sequence of applicable defaults. The following default theory has no extension:

:formula_17

Since formula_18 is consistent with the background theory, the default can be applied, thus leading to the conclusion that formula_18 is false. This result however undermines the assumption that has been made for applying the first default. Consequently, this theory has no extensions.

In a normal default theory, all defaults are normal: each default has the form formula_20. A normal default theory is guaranteed to have at least one extension. Furthermore, the extensions of a normal default theory are mutually inconsistent, i.e., inconsistent with each other.

===Entailment===
A default theory can have zero, one, or more extensions. Entailment of a formula from a default theory can be defined in two ways:

; Skeptical : a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by all its extensions;

; Credulous : a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by at least one of its extensions.

Thus, the Nixon diamond example theory has two extensions, one in which Nixon is a pacifist and one in which he is not a pacifist. Consequently, neither {{math|Pacifist(Nixon)}} nor {{math|¬Pacifist(Nixon)}} are skeptically entailed, while both of them are credulously entailed. As this example shows, the credulous consequences of a default theory may be inconsistent with each other.

===Alternative default inference rules===
The following alternative inference rules for default logic are all based on the same syntax as the original system.

; Justified: differs from the original one in that a default is not applied if thereby the set {{mvar|T}} becomes inconsistent with a justification of an applied default;

; Concise: a default is applied only if its consequence is not already entailed by {{mvar|T}} (the exact definition is more complicated than this one; this is only the main idea behind it);

; Constrained: a default is applied only if the set composed of the background theory, the justifications of all applied defaults, and the consequences of all applied defaults (including this one) is consistent;

; Rational: similar to constrained default logic, but the consequence of the default to add is not considered in the consistency check;

; Cautious: defaults that can be applied but are conflicting with each other (like the ones of the Nixon diamond example) are not applied.

The justified and constrained versions of the inference rule assign at least an extension to every default theory.

==Variants of default logic==
The following variants of default logic differ from the original one on both syntax and semantics.

; Assertional variants : An assertion is a pair formula_21 composed of a formula and a set of formulae. Such a pair indicates that {{mvar|p}} is true while the formulae formula_22 have been assumed consistent to prove that {{mvar|p}} is true. An assertional default theory is composed of an assertional theory (a set of assertional formulae) called the background theory and a set of defaults defined as in the original syntax. Whenever a default is applied to an assertional theory, the pair composed of its consequence and its set of justifications is added to the theory. The following semantics use assertional theories:

* Cumulative default logic
* Commitment to assumptions default logic
* Quasi-default logic

; Weak extensions : rather than checking whether the preconditions are valid in the theory composed of the background theory and the consequences of the applied defaults, the preconditions are checked for validity in the extension that will be generated; in other words, the algorithm for generating extensions starts by guessing a theory and using it in place of the background theory; what results from the process of extension generation is actually an extension only if it is equivalent to the theory guessed at the beginning. This variant of default logic is related in principle to autoepistemic logic, where a theory formula_23 has the model in which {{mvar|x}} is true just because, assuming formula_24 true, the formula formula_23 supports the initial assumption.

; Disjunctive default logic : the consequence of a default is a set of formulae instead of a single formula. Whenever the default is applied, at least one of its consequences is nondeterministically chosen and made true.

; Priorities on defaults : the relative priority of defaults can be explicitly specified; among the defaults that are applicable to a theory, only one of the most preferred ones can be applied. Some semantics of default logic do not require priorities to be explicitly specified; rather, more specific defaults (those that are applicable in fewer cases) are preferred over less specific ones.

; Statistical variant : a statistical default is a default with an attached upper bound on its frequency of error; in other words, the default is assumed to be an incorrect inference rule in at most that fraction of times it is applied.

==Translations==
Default theories can be translated into theories in other logics and vice versa. The following conditions on translations have been considered:

; Consequence-Preserving : the original and the translated theories have the same (propositional) consequences;

; Faithful : this condition only makes sense when translating between two variants of default logic or between default logic and a logic in which a concept similar to extension exists, e.g., models in modal logic; a translation is faithful if there exists a mapping (typically, a bijection) between the extensions (or models) of the original and translated theories;

; Modular : a translation from default logic to another logic is modular if the defaults and the background theory can be translated separately; moreover, the addition of formulae to the background theory only leads to adding the new formulae to the result of the translation;

; Same-Alphabet : the original and translated theories are built on the same alphabet;

; Polynomial : the running time of the translation or the size of the generated theory are required to be polynomial in the size of the original theory.

Translations are typically required to be faithful or at
least consequence-preserving, while the conditions of
modularity and same alphabet are sometimes ignored.

The translatability between propositional default logic and
the following logics have been studied:

* classical propositional logic;
* autoepistemic logic;
* propositional default logic restricted to seminormal theories;
* alternative semantics of default logic;
* circumscription.

Translations exist or not depending on which conditions are imposed. Translations from propositional default logic to classical propositional logic cannot always generate a polynomially sized propositional theory, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Translations to autoepistemic logic exist or not depending on whether modularity or the use of the same alphabet is required.

==Complexity==
The computational complexity of the following problems about default logic is known:

; Existence of extensions : deciding whether a propositional default theory has at least one extension is formula_26-complete;

; Skeptical entailment : deciding whether a propositional default theory skeptically entails a propositional formula is formula_27-complete;

; Credulous entailment : deciding whether a propositional default theory credulously entails a propositional formula is formula_26-complete;

; Extension checking : deciding whether a propositional formula is equivalent to an extension of a propositional default theory is formula_29-complete;

; Model checking : deciding whether a propositional interpretation is a model of an extension of a propositional default theory is formula_26-complete.

<text>Bonnie Kathleen Blair (born March 18, 1964) is a retired American speed skater. She is one of the top skaters of her era, and one of the most decorated athletes in Olympic history. Blair competed for the United States in four Olympics, winning five gold medals and one bronze medal.

Blair made her Olympic debut in Sarajevo in 1984 where she finished eighth in the 500 meters. At the time, Blair trained in both short-track and long-track speed skating. She won the 1986 short-track world championship. Blair returned to the Olympics in 1988 competing in long-track at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. There she won her first Olympic gold medal in the 500 meters and a bronze medal in the 1,000 meter. Blair won two gold medals in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and her final two Olympic gold medals at the 1994 Lillehammer games. Blair continued competing through 1995 when the World Championships were held in Milwaukee, finally retiring in March 1995.

After retiring from speed skating, Blair became a motivational speaker. She has been inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame, the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==

Blair was born in Cornwall, New York to Charlie and Eleanor Blair. She was the youngest of six children. Her godmother is Canadian speed skater Cathy Priestner. The family moved to Champaign, Illinois when Bonnie was a toddler. Bonnie first tried skating, already a hobby for her siblings, at age two. She participated in her first skating meet at age 4. Early on, Blair competed in &quot;pack style,&quot; or short track speed skating, where several skaters race on the ice at once. At age 7, Blair won her age group at the Illinois Speed Skating Championship. She attended Jefferson Middle School and later Centennial High School in Champaign In addition to skating, Blair was also a cheer leader and a member of the student council.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1979 when Olympic medalist Cathy Priestner Faminow became Blair&#x27;s coach that Blair switched from pack style to long track speed skating in which skaters compete for the fastest time. At age 15, Blair tried out for the national team, earning a spot on her first attempt. With her increased focus on the 1984 Olympics, Blair went to train in Europe. To finance the expense of training in Europe, the Champaign Policemen&#x27;s Benevolent Association began helping to sponsor Blair. She completed her high school diploma through the mail in 1982. She moved to the Milwaukee area to train with the United States national speed skating team, living with a family friend while she trained. Blair took classes at Parkland College, although college classes were less of a priority than training and she did not receive a degree.

==Career==

=== Early career and first Olympics (1984–1986) ===
Blair made her international competitive debut at the 1984 World Sprinting Championships where she placed tenth. Later that year, Blair appeared at her first Olympic games at age 19 in Sarajevo. Blair had not been not considered a front-runner and later recalled she was happy just to be at the games and see her family in the stands. She failed to medal and finished eighth in the 500 meters. The U.S. failed to win any speed skating medals at the 1984 Olympics. After the 1984 Olympics, Blair worked closely with coach Mike Crowe to improve her skating skills to compete with the powerful East German skaters.

A strong performance at the United States International Skating Association Metric All-Around Championships, held in West Allis, Wisconsin, earned Blair a spot on the U.S. long track women&#x27;s sprint team for the 1985 World Championships. Blair won both the 500 meter and 1500 meter at the West Allis event, and was considered one of the U.S. team&#x27;s strongest medal contenders. On the 1985-1986 World Cup Circuit, Blair finished fourth in four distances: the 500 meter, 1,000 meter, and 1,500 meter. In May 1985, at a time when U.S. speed skating lacked unity, U.S. International Speedskating Association replaced national team coach Dianne Holum with Mike Crowe.

During this time, Blair trained in both short-track and long-track. Blair won events at 1984, 1985 and 1986 short-track world championships and was the 1986 overall short-track world champion.

=== Rise and becoming an Olympic medalist (1987–1989) ===
Early in 1987, Blair won World Cup titles in the 500 and 1,000 meters. She followed up her World Cup titles in by setting her first world record in the 500 meters with a time 39.43 seconds. Blair also proved she could beat East-German world champion Karin Enke-Kania in head-to-head match-ups. Although Blair was four inches shorter than Enke-Kania, Blair&#x27;s technique and fast start time made her a formidable competitor. Blair held a world record at 500 meters until December 1987 when Christa Rothenburger beat her time at the World Cup. Blair, under the weather with a cough and cold, finished second in the event. Overall, Blair won 4 of 18 women&#x27;s medals at the 1987 World Cup; East German skaters, including Rothenburger, won 13.

At the December 1987 U.S. speed skating trials for the 1988 Winter Olympics, Blair led the women&#x27;s field in the 500,1,000, and 1,500 meters, securing her place on the U.S. Olympic team, as expected. Blair was considered a stronger competitor in the shorter distances, where she was seen as the United States&#x27; best chance at a gold medal in speed skating. U.S. speed skating failure to win a single medal at the 1984 Olympics added to the pressure and attention focused on Blair leading up to the 1988 games.

Blair went on to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, where her first event was the 500 meters. Rothenburger skating first, setting a new world record. Blair responded to the challenge with her best start ever in the 500 meters, winning the gold medal in world record time of 39.10 seconds. For her second event of the games, Blair had a personal best and briefly set an Olympic record in the 1,000 meters. Two of Blair&#x27;s competitors, who skated after her, subsequently beat her time; thus Blair won the bronze in the 1,000 meters. Blair&#x27;s third and final event of the 1988 Winter Olympics was the 1,500 meters, in which she placed fourth. Blair&#x27;s family friends in the stands, affectionately known as the &quot;Blair Bunch,&quot; became a staple of her competitive career. To end the games, Blair was chosen to carry the American flag at the closing ceremonies.

Despite her success at the 1988 Olympics, Blair did not enjoy a windfall from endorsements. Holding Blair back from more advertisements was both her choice of sports, which was thought to be less marketable, and ABC&#x27;s coverage of the games, which failed to resonate with viewers. Blair also took a break from skating, enrolling in Montana Technological University. She skipped the first two World Cup events of the 1989 season. Blair was back to competing later in the season and won the 1989 World Sprint Championships held in Heerenveen, Netherlands. At the event, Blair won the 500 meters twice and finished third and second in two 100 meters races for an overall victory. The win made Blair the first U.S. woman to win a world sprint championship in nearly a decade.

Following the 1988 Olympics, Blair also tried track cycle racing, and was coached by former speed skater and cycling world champion Connie Paraskevin. Cycling became part of Blair&#x27;s speed skating training as both sports utilized the same muscle groups. She made her competitive cycling debut in June 1989 at the Sundance Juice Sparkler Grand Prix. After placing fourth at U.S. Nationals and missing the opportunity to compete at the World Championships, Blair opted to give up competitive cycling and focus solely on speed skating.

=== Repeat Olympic gold (1990–1992) ===
The 1990–1991 season had setbacks for Blair. She contracted a severe case of bronchitis that affected her breathing. The breathing problem lingered through the 1991 World Sprint Championships where she finished fifth. As confidence in coach Crowe had waned in the lead up to the 1988 Olympics, Blair helped to recruit Peter Mueller to coach the U.S. team. The coaching switch took place ten months before the 1992 Olympics. Training with Mueller in the summer before the Olympics, Blair regained her competitive edge.

Blair again competed at Olympics in 1992, this time held in Albertville, France. Although she had won gold at the prior Olympics, Blair felt that her small stature made her an underdog against much larger East German competitors. Blair again won gold in the 500 meters, becoming the first woman to win the event in back to back Olympics, with a time of 40.33 seconds. Her winning time was slower than her record setting pace in Calgary, however, the venue in Albertville was outdoors creating conditions which were less conducive for speed skating. The second-place finisher, Ye Qiaobo of China, claimed to have been slowed down by an improper crossover from another skater. Although Ye claimed the crossover cost her the gold, the referee&#x27;s rejected China&#x27;s protest. Blair dedicated her gold medal to her father, Charlie, who had died from lung cancer two years earlier. Charlie had dreamed of Bonnie becoming an Olympic speed skater.

In her second event, the 1,500 meters, Blair finished 21st. The placement was due in part to the strategy of her coach, Peter Mueller; Mueller told Blair he would give her a signal to coast if he felt she was not on pace for a podium finish, allowing her to conserve energy. As Blair approached the final 400 meters, Mueller gave the signal. Blair won her second gold of the 1992 Olympics in the 1,000 meters (1:21.90). Her time was only 0.02 seconds faster than Ye. Blair&#x27;s gold made her the most decorated U.S. woman in Winter Olympics of all time.

Her success in the 1992 Olympics led to more attention for Blair. She was on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Blair also began to pick-up more endorsements, including sports marketing group Advantage International. After the Olympics, Blair moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to train at the newly opened Pettit International Ice Center.

=== Final Olympics (1993–1994) ===
Back in 1986, the International Olympic Committee voted to stage the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympics in alternating four year cycles. Thus, the next Winter Games would be held in February 1994. The attempt to compete at her fourth Olympics was not without its challenges; the 1993 season was lackluster for Blair. At the 1993 World Sprint Championships, Blair did not win any of her four races finishing behind rival Ye Qiabo. Blair felt as though she had lost her quickness and after failing to rectify the problem with coach Peter Mueller, she switched to Nick Thometz. At the 1994, U.S. Olympic long-track trials at the Pettit National Ice Center, Blair set track records in the first round of the 500 meter and 1,000 meter trails.

The 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, were another success for Blair: She again won gold in the 500 meters (39.25) and 1,000 meters (1:18.74) races. Blair finished 0.36 seconds ahead of the second best time in the 500 meters. Her 1.38 second margin in the 1,000 meters race is the largest margin of victory in the history of the event. Blair&#x27;s success at Lillehammer placed her among the most decorate American Olympians of all time. She became the first American woman to win five gold Olympic medals and the first American Winter Olympian to win six career medals. In addition to the 500 and 1,000 meters races, Blair also competed in the 1,500 meter distance, missing the podium with a fourth-place finish. At her post race press conference, Blair confirmed Lillehammer would be her last Olympic games.

===Post-Olympic career===
After the 1994 Olympics, Blair continued to compete. Less than a month after Lillehammer Olympics, Blair set another world record in the 500 meters, becoming the first female to complete the race in under 39 seconds, achieving a time of 38.99 seconds. Blair topped her own World Record the following year, achieving a time of 38.69 on February 12, 1995, in Calgary. Blair continued on to the 1995 World Championships in her adopted home town of Milwaukee. The Blair Bunch, the name given to Blair&#x27;s family and friends, accounted for 12% of the crowd at the Pettit National Ice Center. There, Blair won the 500 meters with a time of 39.54 seconds. On March 18, 1995, she retired.

After fellow speed skater Johann Olav Koss founded Right to Play in 2000, he recruited Blair to serve as one of the charities first celebrity ambassadors. Blair became involved with Right to Play, When the Winter Olympics returned to the United States in 2002, Blair was one of the final torchbearers to carry the Olympic flame into Rice-Eccles Stadium for the opening ceremony in Salt Lake City, Utah. As of 2002, Blair served on U.S. Speedskating&#x27;s board of directors. As of 2014, Blair worked as a motivational speaker and corporate spokesperson. That same year she was a member of the U.S. Olympic delegation to Sochi. As of 2018, Blair serves on the board of the Pettit National Ice Center.

==Awards and honors==

In 1992, Blair became the third winter athlete to win the Sullivan Award. Blair won the 1992 Oscar Mathisen Award (being the first female winner of this award). In 1992, Blair received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. She also was Female Athlete of the Year as selected by the Associated Press in 1994. Blair also won the World Cup points championship 11 times. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Blair their Sportswoman of the Year for 1994. By 1994, Blair&#x27;s hometown of Champaign had renamed one of its streets Bonnie Blair Drive.

She is a member of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame and the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2004, she was elected to the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

<doc id="889642" wikidata="Q867914" url="?curid=889642" title="Clausula (music)">
<text>The clausula (Latin for &quot;little close” or “little conclusion&quot;; plural clausulae) was a newly composed section of discant (&quot;note against note&quot;) inserted into a pre-existing setting of &quot;organum&quot;. &quot;Clausulae&quot; flourished in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries and were associated with the Notre Dame school. The origin of the &quot;clausula&quot; has long been subject of scholarly debate, as the relationship between &quot;clausulae&quot; and motets is very complicated. &quot;Clausulae&quot; eventually became used as substitutes for passages of original plainchant. They occur as melismatic figures based on a single word or syllable within an &quot;organum&quot;.

== Origins ==
&quot;Clausulae&quot; emerged from the compositional practices of the Notre Dame school in Paris c. 1160–1250 (during the stylistic period known as &quot;ars antiqua&quot;). The composers Léonin and Pérotin in particular contributed heavily in composing &quot;clausulae&quot;. Rather than write entirely new music, the preference was to take existing music, that is, plainchant melodies, and develop or improve upon them. According to an English author known as Anonymous IV (c. 1280), &quot;Pérotin was better at making clausulae than Léonin had been in that Pérotin was better at making better discant style of clausulae.&quot; The appearance of &quot;clausulae&quot; provided the first rhythmic system. (It is hard to find rhythmic notation in the earliest motets because of the lack of the use of clear rhythmic notation in the manuscripts.) Pérotin&#x27;s &quot;clausulae&quot; make use of the rhythmic modes, whose strict metrical feet necessitated that voices change notes together (&quot;discantus&quot;). This was in contrast to the earlier practice of one voice moving in a free rhythm above a &quot;tenor&quot; voice (Latin &quot;tenere&quot;: &quot;to hold&quot;) sustaining the long notes of a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;. The tenor line was often repeated to allow for expansion of the &quot;clausula&quot;; this was the origin of the technique known as isorhythm.

The scholarly debate over the origin of the &quot;clausula&quot; continues. In particular, rather than seeing &quot;clausula&quot; as a genre, the part composed in the style of &quot;discantus&quot; with a definite final cadence was called &quot;clausula&quot;. Thus, there are more studies that relate specifically to the motet, rather than studies of the origin of the &quot;clausula&quot;. One scholar writes that &quot;the motet arose through the addition of Latin texts to the melismatic upper voices of the two-voice &quot;clausulae&quot; and was thereby able to explain for the first time the previously baffling and unprecedented verse structures of many motet texts.&quot; Others claim that by the removal of the text of a motet in its original composition, it was changed into a clausula. As the relationship between clausulae and motets is very complicated, there are conflicting conclusions on whether the &quot;clausula&quot; or the motet came first. Instead, the relationship between the two is complexly intertwined and closely influenced by each other.

== Function and development ==
Clausulae enriched pre-existing settings of organum. Hundreds of clausulae in two, three and four parts were incorporated into the Magnus Liber Organi of Léonin and Pérotin. Others were arranged in liturgical order within manuscripts so that they could be easily introduced into a particular organum setting or piece of plainchant. As they were notated separately, it was possible for them to be expanded and developed further, and they eventually became standalone pieces which could be sung at certain points in the liturgy. At that time, there were some clausulae that people liked or were particularly popular, for example, those composed on the tenor REGNAT from the verse of the Ascension &quot;Alleluia Hodie Maria virgo&quot; in the early thirteenth-century. Over time, the appearance and use of clausulae changed little by little, but the images of clausulae found in different times and regions still had similar characters. Some clausulae matched the melodic lines from the French motet without text. This is an important clue to the eventual transformation of clausulae into the form of motet&quot;.&quot; The composition of clausulae died out in the mid-13th century as they were replaced by motets as the main platform for the development of new compositional techniques. Norman Smith claimed that the music of pre-existing clausulae in three early thirteenth-century Latin motets in the Florence Manuscript resemble each other so much that it&#x27;s hard to find differences in rhythms between the motet and the clausula, which clearly exists. However the difference reflects the artistic changes that occurred in the process of texting clausulae. Obviously, possibilities and usefulness of clausula played a pivotal role in the creation of an important musical genre called the motet.

<doc id="889645" wikidata="Q310867" url="?curid=889645" title="Sanjay Dutt">
<text>Sanjay Balraj Dutt (born 29 July 1959) is an Indian actor, playback singer and film producer who works in Hindi cinema in addition to a few Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Punjabi films. One of the most popular actors of Hindi cinema, Dutt has won several accolades and acted in over 160 films.

Part of the Dutt family of Punjabi background, he is the son of actor-politicians Sunil Dutt and Nargis. Dutt made his acting debut with &quot;Rocky&quot; (1981), directed by his father. A career downturn followed, with the exception of the crime thriller &quot;Naam&quot; (1986), a milestone in his career. He later established himself as a superstar with films like &quot;Thanedaar&quot; (1990), &quot;Saajan&quot;, &quot;Sadak&quot; (both 1991), &quot;Adharm&quot; (1992), &quot;Khalnayak&quot; (1993), &quot;&quot; (1994), &quot;&quot;, &quot;Haseena Maan Jaayegi&quot;, &quot;&quot; (all 1999) and &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; (2000). His critically acclaimed performance in &quot;Vaastav&quot; won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

Dutt gained widespread acclaim for playing Munna Bhai in Rajkumar Hirani&#x27;s &quot;Munna Bhai&quot; series (2003–2006), his most iconic role, and his biggest sole commercial success ever. Since 2000, his other notable films include - &quot;Jodi No.1&quot; (2001), Rakht, Musafir (both 2004), Shabd, Parineeta&quot;,Dus&quot; (all 2005), &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot; , &quot;Dhamaal&quot; (both 2007), &quot;All the Best&quot; (2009), &quot;Double Dhamaal&quot; (2011), &quot;Agneepath&quot;, and &quot;Son of Sardaar&quot; (both 2012). He reunited with Hirani on &quot;PK&quot; (2014). This was followed by another major career downturn with the exceptions of Kannada film &quot;K.G.F: Chapter 2&quot; (2022) and the Tamil film &quot;Leo&quot; (2023), the former being the 4th highest-grossing Indian film and the latter being the 12th highest-grossing Indian film, both in which he played the main antagonist.

Dutt was arrested under the TADA and the Arms Act in April 1993 and was convicted later for violation of Arms Act for possession of illegal weapons procured from other accused in the 1993 Bombay bombings. He was sentenced to five years in prison. He was granted bail several times during his sentence which is why he only completed his five-year jail sentence in 2016. He was granted bail in 1993, 1995, 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2016. Dutt&#x27;s life receives considerable media coverage in India, and in 2018, &quot;Sanju&quot;, a biopic based on his life (which also saw a special appearance by him), starring Ranbir Kapoor as Dutt, was released to positive reviews and emerged as one of the highest-grossers of Indian cinema.

== Early life ==
Sanjay Dutt was born in Bombay (now Mumbai since 1995), Bombay State, to parents who were noted Hindi cinema actors Sunil Dutt and Nargis Dutt. Born to a Punjabi Hindu (Mohyal Brahmin) father and a Muslim mother of Punjabi descent, Dutt&#x27;s ancestry can be traced back to the Rawalpindi Division of West Punjab (present-day Pakistan); with his paternal village being Khurd in Jhelum District. Through his father, he belongs to the Hussaini Brahmin community, which reveres Imam Hussain and has participated in the battle of Karbala, the community&#x27;s fluid identity as half-Hindu and half-Muslim having made it vulnerable during the 1947 Partition riots. Sanjay has two sisters, Priya Dutt and Namrata Dutt. He is the maternal grandson of music composer Jaddanbai and nephew of actor Anwar Hussain.

Sanjay&#x27;s name was chosen by crowdsourcing via the Urdu language film magazine &quot;Shama&quot;. His mother died in 1981, shortly before his debut film&#x27;s premiere; her death is cited as the instigator of his drug abuse. Dutt made his acting debut at an early age, playing a child qawali singer in his father&#x27;s film &quot;Reshma Aur Shera&quot; (1971).

== Career ==

=== Early career and breakthrough (1981–1990) ===
Dutt made his Bollywood film debut with the moderately successful &quot;Rocky&quot; in 1981. Dutt then went on to star in &quot;Vidhaata&quot;, the highest-grossing Hindi film of 1982, along with film veterans Dilip Kumar, Shammi Kapoor and Sanjeev Kumar. He also starred in movies like &quot;Main Awara Hoon&quot; (1983). In 1985, he shot , his first film in two years.

The 1986 film &quot;Naam&quot; was a turning point in Dutt&#x27;s career, it was a major critical and commercial success. Dutt appeared in successful films throughout the &#x27;80s such as &quot;Imaandaar&quot;, &quot;Inaam Dus Hazaar&quot; (1987), &quot;Jeete Hain Shaan Se&quot; (1988), &quot;Mardon Wali Baat&quot; (1988), &quot;Ilaaka&quot; (1989), &quot;Hum Bhi Insaan Hain&quot; (1989), &quot;Kanoon Apna Apna&quot; (1989) and &quot;Taaqatwar&quot; (1989)&quot;.&quot;

His performances in both &quot;Kabzaa&quot; (1988) and J. P. Dutta&#x27;s &quot;Hathyar&quot; (1989) were both well received by critics, although both films only managed average collections at the box office. In the late 1980s, he was seen in a number of multi-starrers alongside leading actors like Govinda, Mithun, Dharmendra, Jackie Shroff and Sunny Deol.
=== Rise to prominence (1991–1993) ===
His successes continued in the 1990s, with films that include &quot;Tejaa&quot; (1990), &quot;Khatarnaak&quot; (1990), &quot;Zahreelay&quot;, (1990) &quot;Thanedaar&quot; (1990), &quot;Khoon Ka Karz&quot; (1991), &quot;Yalgaar&quot; (1992), &quot;Gumrah&quot; (1993), &quot;Sahibaan&quot; (1993) and &quot;&quot; (1994). He went on to star in some of the most era-defining Indian films of the early 1990s such as &quot;Sadak&quot; (1991), &quot;Saajan&quot; (1991) and &quot;Khalnayak&quot; (1993), earning two nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the latter two.

&quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote that &quot;Dutt&#x27;s earlier films (like &quot;Naam&quot; and &quot;Sadak&quot;) got him a lot of favourable attention&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Saajan&quot; established Dutt as the conventional soft hero.&quot;&quot;Saajan&quot; was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 1991, and &quot;Sadak&quot; was the fifth highest grosser of 1991. &quot;Khalnayak&quot; became a blockbuster and was the second-highest grosser of 1993. This was followed by another box office success &quot;Gumrah&quot;, this was Dutt&#x27;s second consecutive hit of the year.

=== Involvement in 1993 serial bombings and later career (1993–1998) ===
Bombay (now Mumbai) suffered a series of serial bombings in 1993. Dutt was among several people associated with Bollywood who were accused of involvement. It was alleged that Dutt accepted delivery of weapons at his house from Abu Salem and co-accused Riyaz Siddiqui, who had also been implicated in relation to the Mumbai blasts. It was claimed that the weapons formed a part of a large consignment of arms connected to the terrorists. Dutt, however, in his confession stated that he took only one Type-56 from the producers of his movie &quot;Sanam&quot;, for his own family protection. It has also been reported that Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s father Sunil Dutt&#x27;s political rivalry caused Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s conviction. Dutt&#x27;s first film after his 1993 arrest was &quot;Daud&quot; (1997). It did average business at the box office despite getting a lot of publicity. This was followed by &quot;Dushman&quot; (1998) which did well financially.

=== Resurgence (1999–2002) ===
1999 was an excellent year for Dutt and one that is regarded as his comeback, with all of his five releases being among the highest-grossing films of that year. He began it by starring in the Mahesh Bhatt-directed film &quot;Kartoos&quot;, followed by &quot;Khoobsurat&quot;, &quot;Haseena Maan Jaayegi&quot;, &quot;Daag: The Fire&quot; and &quot;&quot;, for which he won many awards, including his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. His role in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; won him critical acclaim and a number of awards and nominations, including his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Dutt was also invited by the President of India to Rashtrapati Bhavan for his performance in the film.

As the decade went on, he continued to play lead roles in critical and commercial successes such as &quot;Jodi No.1&quot; (2001), &quot;Pitaah&quot; (2002) and &quot;Kaante&quot; (2002), which earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

=== &quot;Munna Bhai&quot; and supporting roles (2003–2014) ===
He played the lead role in the National Award-winning film &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot; (2003), which garnered him several awards, including his first Filmfare Award for Best Comedian. At the box office, &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot; achieved a silver jubilee status (25-week run) being one of only eight films to have achieved this status since the year 2000. In its 26th week of release, the film could still be found playing on 257 screens throughout India. Later successes came with &quot;Musafir&quot; (2004), &quot;Plan&quot; (2004), &quot;Parineeta&quot; (2005), which earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and &quot;Dus&quot; (2005). He also won critical acclaim for his performances in &quot;Shabd&quot; (2005) and &quot;Zinda&quot; (2006).

The sequel of &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot;, &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot; was released on 1 September 2006, for which Dutt received a number of awards, along with an award from the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his work in the &quot;Munna Bhai&quot; series. NDTV India counted the character &quot;Munna Bhai&quot; as one of top 20 fictional characters in Bollywood. Dutt earned his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film. 

In January 2008, the Indian film Institute Filmfare listed 12 films featuring Dutt in its list of the top 100 highest-grossing movies of all time. In its May 2013 edition &quot;100 years of Indian cinema&quot;, &quot;Filmfare&quot; listed three films featuring Dutt in its top 20 list of highest-grossing Hindi films of all time, adjusted for inflation these films were &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot;, &quot;Khalnayak&quot; and &quot;Saajan&quot;. Later, Dutt starred in movies like &quot;Dhamaal&quot; (2007), &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot; (2007), &quot;All the Best&quot; (2009), &quot;Double Dhamaal&quot; (2011), &quot;Son of Sardaar&quot; (2012) &quot;Agneepath&quot; (2012) and &quot;PK&quot; (2014).

=== Setbacks and expansion into South Indian films (2016–present) ===
Vidhu Vinod Chopra on 29 September 2016 announced that the third part of Munna Bhai series, starring Dutt in the title role, would begin soon. However, as of 2024, production on the film has still not commenced.

In 2017, Dutt appeared as the lead in &quot;Bhoomi&quot;, directed by Omung Kumar. In 2018, he starred in &quot;Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster 3&quot;. On 29 June 2018, his biopic &quot;Sanju&quot; released in which he made a special appearance. He then produced and starred in&quot;Prassthanam&quot;, which released on 20 September 2019.

Due to the COVID pandemic, Dutt then had four OTT releases. First was &quot;Sadak 2&quot;, a sequel to his 1991 film &quot;Sadak&quot;, co starring Alia Bhatt and Aditya Roy Kapur. The trailer for the film became the most disliked trailer of all time, with fans critical of nepotism following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. The film was universally panned and some claimed it to be one of the worst films in Dutt&#x27;s career. Then came Netflix release Torbaaz, an action thriller set in Afghanistan. His 2021 release &quot;&quot;, which featured an ensemble cast consisting of Ajay Devgn, Sonakshi Sinha and Nora Fatehi, also received negative reviews. However, in 2022, Dutt appeared in &quot;Toolsidas Junior&quot;, a sports drama which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.

Also in 2022, Dutt made his debut in Kannada cinema as Adheera, the main antagonist in &quot;K.G.F: Chapter 2&quot;, the sequel to the blockbuster Kannada film, &quot;K.G.F: Chapter 1&quot;. The movie was a financial success and became the third highest grossing Indian film. However, his other 2022 theatrical releases were financial flops - the period epic &quot;Shamshera&quot;, directed by Karan Malhotra and starring Ranbir Kapoor, in which he again played a key antagonist, and &quot;Samrat Prithviraj&quot; alongside Akshay Kumar.

In 2023, Dutt performed a cameo in Shah Rukh Khan starrer &quot;Jawan&quot; and played a key antagonist in Lokesh Kanagaraj&#x27;s &quot;Leo&quot; (2023) alongside Vijay, making his debut in Tamil cinema. Both were huge financial successes. In 2024, he reunited with Raveena Tandon in the digital film &quot;Ghudchadi&quot; and made his Telugu cinema debut with Puri Jagannadh&#x27;s &quot;Double iSmart&quot;, which was a box office debacle.

Dutt is next set to appear in &quot;Housefull 5&quot;, &quot;Son of Sardaar 2&quot;, &quot;Baaghi 4&quot;, &quot;Dhurandhar&quot;, &quot;The Raja Saab&quot;, &quot;Baap&quot;, &quot;KD - The Devil&quot;, the Punjabi film &quot;Sheran di Kaum Punjabi&quot;, an untitled film with Arshad Warsi, and his production &quot;The Virgin Tree&quot;. He will also star in the big-budget international film &quot;The Good Maharaja&quot;.

== Off-screen work ==

=== Hosting ===
Dutt co-hosted the fifth season of the Indian reality show &quot;Bigg Boss&quot; along with Salman Khan. The show aired on &quot;Colors&quot; television from 2 October 2011 to 7 January 2012. Dutt later said it was Khan who persuaded him to co-host the show. 

=== MMA league ===
Dutt and entrepreneur Indian Premier League cricket team owner Raj Kundra together launched India&#x27;s first professionally organised mixed martial arts league—the Super Fight League—on 16 January 2012.

=== Poetry ===
While in jail, Dutt wrote some Hindi poetry, around 100 couplets, that he aims to release as a book in the future under the title &quot;Salaakhen&quot; (Lock Up).

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
In the early 1980, Dutt had a relationship with his co-star from his first film, Tina Munim. After this relationship ended, Dutt married actress Richa Sharma in 1987. She died of a brain tumour in 1996. The couple have a daughter, Trishala Dutt, born in 1988, who lives in the United States with her maternal grandparents.

Dutt&#x27;s second marriage was to air-hostess-turned-model Rhea Pillai on 14 February 1998. The divorce finalised in 2008. Dutt married Manyata (born Dilnawaz Sheikh) first registered in Goa in 2008 and then, in a Hindu ceremony in Mumbai, after two years of dating. On 21 October 2010, he became a father to twins, a boy and a girl.

=== Religion ===
Earlier, Dutt used to identify with Islam, for example wearing Qur&#x27;anic verses around his neck, which Mahesh Bhatt attributed to his mother&#x27;s family, Dutt also often frequenting his maternal uncle&#x27;s house and thus his Muslim cousins. When the police interrogated him following the 1992-1993 Mumbai riots about an assault rifle he conceded getting from Anees Ibrahim, the brother of Dawood Ibrahim, he responded that &quot;Because I have Muslim blood in my veins. I could not bear what was happening in the city.&quot;

In more recent years, Dutt has been connected more with Hinduism, and is considered a worshiper of Shiva. Dutt performed &quot;pind daan&quot;, a Hindu ritual that involves paying homage to the ancestors, for his deceased parents in January 2024.

=== Health issues ===
Sanjay Dutt was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. He took treatment in Mumbai and now has recovered from lung cancer.

== Controversies ==

=== 1993 Bombay bombings case ===
Bombay suffered a series of serial bombings in 1993. Dutt was among several people associated with Bollywood who were accused of involvement. It was alleged that Dutt accepted a delivery of weapons at his house from Abu Salem and co-accused Riyaz Siddiqui, who had also been implicated in relation to the Bombay blasts. It was claimed that the weapons formed a part of a large consignment of arms connected to the terrorists. Dutt, however, in his confession stated that he took only one Type-56 from the producers of his movie &quot;Sanam&quot;, for his own family protection. It has also been reported that Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s father Sunil Dutt&#x27;s political rivalry caused Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s conviction.

On 19 April 1993, after initial reporting by Baljeet Parmar on Dutt&#x27;s possession of the AK-56, he was arrested under the provisions of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). Dutt was granted bail by the Supreme Court of India on 5 May 1993; however, on 4 July 1994 his bail was cancelled and he was re-arrested. On 16 October 1995 he was granted bail. Abdul Qayyum Abdul Karim Shaikh, who was thought to be a close aide of the terrorists&#x27; ringleader, Dawood Ibrahim, was arrested. Dutt had given Qayuum&#x27;s name to the police when confessing to arms possession, saying that in September 1992 he had bought a pistol from Qayuum in Dubai. His arrest coincided with the release of his film, &quot;Khalnayak,&quot; in which he played a wanted criminal. The film&#x27;s major success was in part due to Dutt&#x27;s off-screen legal controversy.

On 31 July 2007, Dutt was cleared of the charges relating to the Mumbai blast; however, the TADA court sentenced Dutt to six years&#x27; rigorous imprisonment under Arms act for illegal possession of weapons. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The actor claimed he feared for his life after the notorious &#x27;Black Friday&#x27; bombings, which were allegedly staged by Mumbai&#x27;s Muslim-dominated mafia in retaliation for deadly Hindu-Muslim clashes a few months earlier. But the judge rejected this defence and also refused bail.&quot; Dutt was returned to at the Arthur Road Jail and soon after moved to the Yerawada Central Jail in Pune. Dutt appealed against the sentence and was granted interim bail on 20 August 2007 until such time as the TADA court provided him with a copy of its judgement. On 22 October 2007 Dutt was back in jail but again applied for bail. On 27 November 2007, Dutt was granted bail by the Supreme Court. On 21 March 2013 the Supreme Court upheld the verdict but shortened the sentence to five years&#x27; imprisonment. Dutt was given a month to surrender before the authorities.

Dutt has said that &quot;I am not a politician but I belong to a political family.&quot; He was persuaded by a close friend to contest the 2009 Lok Sabha elections as a candidate for the Samajwadi Party, but withdrew when the court refused to suspend his conviction. He was then appointed General Secretary of the Samajwadi Party, leaving that post in December 2010. In March 2013 the Supreme Court upheld Dutt&#x27;s five-year sentence, 18 months of which he already spent in jail during the trial. He was given four weeks to surrender to the authorities, the court having refused to release him on probation due to the severity of the offence.

On 10 May, the Supreme Court rejected Dutt&#x27;s review petition for the reconsideration of his conviction and asked him to surrender on the stipulated date. on 14 May, Dutt withdrew the mercy plea and surrendered to the Mumbai Police on 16 May 2013. Just before the surrender, the Mumbai jail authority got an anonymous letter threatening Dutt&#x27;s life. Dutt filed an appeal to allow him to surrender before entering Yerwada Central Jail. Later, Dutt withdrew this request too. He was paroled from 21 December 2013. The parole was extended three times until March 2014, raising concern in Bombay High Court and a proposal from the Government of Maharashtra to amend the law of parole. He returned to Yerwada Central Jail after his parole ended. Dutt was out on a two weeks&#x27; furlough granted by the Yerwada Central Jail authorities on 24 December. He was subsequently incarcerated in Yerwada Central Jail, to complete his jail term. He was released from there on 25 February 2016 after serving his sentence.

=== Drug addiction ===
For years, Dutt struggled with drug abuse, being addicted to cocaine and heroin in particular, having started them for attracting the attention of girls as he put it, but after years of rehab and personal struggle he eventually overcame his drug addiction.

<text>Joseph-Aldric Ouimet (baptized Aldric; May 20, 1848 – May 12, 1916) was a Canadian politician.
== Biography ==
Ouimet was first elected to the House of Commons in an 1873 by-election as member of Parliament for Laval, Quebec. He was a Liberal-Conservative and supporter of the government of Sir John A. Macdonald.

After being educated in a seminary, and a brief career as a journalist, Ouimet became a lawyer. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the age of 25. His advocacy of the rights of French Canadians was challenged by the Conservative government&#x27;s attitude to Louis Riel. Following the First Riel Rebellion, Ouimet argued for Riel to be pardoned, and, in 1875, voted against a Conservative motion to expel Riel from the seat in the House of Commons to which he had been elected.

With the beginning of the Second Riel Rebellion in 1885, Minister of Militia Adolphe Caron asked Ouimet to raise a regiment from Montreal to join in the suppression of the uprising. Ouimet raised three hundred men, and led his regiment as its Lieutenant-Colonel. He was put under the command of Thomas Bland Strange who rejected Ouimet&#x27;s proposal to negotiate safe passage for Riel.

Strange sent Ouimet to Ottawa to secure supplies resulting in newspapers accusing him of desertion. He returned west and was placed in command of Fort Edmonton.

Despite fighting against the rebels, Ouimet opposed the execution of Riel when he returned to Ottawa. Ouimet&#x27;s pleas fell on deaf ears, and, despite his efforts, he was condemned by French Canadians for having helped put down the rebellion.

Ouimet voted in the House of Commons for a Liberal motion to censure the government for executing Riel.

The execution of Riel seriously damaged the Conservative Party in Quebec, and was one of the key factors in the party&#x27;s decline and eventual loss of power. In an attempt at conciliation, Prime Minister Macdonald nominated Ouimet for the position of speaker of the House of Commons following the 1887 election.

Because of the custom of alternating between English and French Speakers following each general election, Ouimet returned to the backbench following the 1891 election. Macdonald died in June 1891, and his longtime Quebec lieutenant, Sir Hector Langevin, was forced to resign from Cabinet due to a corruption scandal in August. In January 1892, Prime Minister Sir John Abbott made Ouimet the senior minister from Quebec, and appointed him to Langevin&#x27;s old job as Minister of Public Works. Ouimet stayed in that position under the succession of Prime Ministers who attempted to keep the Conservative government together. He also served as Acting Minister of Agriculture and Acting Secretary of State for Canada under Sir Mackenzie Bowell. Bowell faced a caucus revolt over his handling of the Manitoba Schools Question and was forced to resign. The issue split the party as English Protestant Conservatives rejected Bowell&#x27;s proposal to create a new Catholic School Board in Manitoba.

With the fall of Bowell&#x27;s cabinet, the opposition of Tory MPs to French Catholic rights in Manitoba further hurt the party&#x27;s prospects among Catholic Quebecers. Perhaps sensing that the Conservative government was doomed and that his prospects of keeping his seat were dim as Quebecers turned against the Tories, Ouimet decided not to run in the 1896 election. He declined to serve in the short-lived Cabinet of the Sir Charles Tupper, the final Tory prime minister prior to the election. He instead accepted a judicial appointment that he held until his death in 1916.

== Legacy ==
He holds the current record for being acclaimed to parliament 5 times.

Ouimet Canyon near Thunder Bay in north-western Ontario is named for him.

<text>The vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum) is the largest extant species of guineafowl. Systematically, it is only distantly related to other guineafowl genera. Its closest living relative, the white breasted guineafowl, &quot;Agelastes meleagrides&quot; inhabit primary forests in Central Africa. It is a member of the bird family Numididae, and is the only member of the genus &quot;Acryllium&quot;. It is a resident breeder in northeast Africa, from southern Ethiopia through Kenya and just into northern Tanzania.

==Description==
The vulturine guineafowl is a large () bird with a round body and small head. It has a longer wings, neck, legs and tail than other guineafowl. The adult has a bare blue face and black neck, and although all other guineafowl have unfeathered heads, this species looks particularly like a vulture because of the long bare neck and head.

The slim neck projects from a cape of long, glossy, blue and white hackles. The breast is cobalt blue, and the rest of the body plumage is black, finely spangled with white. The wings are short and rounded, and the tail is longer than others in the family Numididae.

The sexes are similar, although the female is usually slightly smaller than the male and with smaller tarsal spurs. Young birds are mainly grey-brown, with a duller blue breast and short hackles.

==Behaviour==
The vulturine guineafowl is a species, forming flocks outside the breeding season typically of about 25 birds. This species&#x27; food is seeds and small invertebrates. This guineafowl is terrestrial and will run rather than fly when alarmed. Despite the open habitat, it tends to keep to cover, and roosts in trees. It makes loud &quot;chink-chink-chink-chink-chink&quot; calls.

It breeds in dry and open habitats with scattered bushes and trees, such as savannah or grassland. It usually lays 4–8 cream-coloured eggs in a well-hidden grass-lined scrape.

<text>Alain de Cadenet (27 November 1945 – 1 July 2022) was an English television presenter and racing driver. He was noted for racing in 15 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans during the 1970s and 1980s, achieving one podium finish with third place in 1976.

==Early life==
De Cadenet was born on 27 November 1945, the son of Maxime de Cadenet, a lieutenant or a film technician in the French Air Force, and his English first wife, Valerie (), who occasionally acted in Hollywood. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, he &quot;claimed that his French ancestors had fought with Charlemagne in the 9th century&quot;. As a baby he and his family were abandoned by his father. He attended Framlingham College in Suffolk. Although he studied to become a barrister, he did not pursue the profession. He first worked as a fashion and music photographer for Radio Caroline and Wonderful Radio London.

==Career==
De Cadenet decided to pursue racing after attending a race meeting at Brands Hatch in which his friend was participating. He made his reputation building and driving his own sports prototypes, taking on works teams and occasionally beating them. After a life-threatening accident at the Targa Florio, he first raced at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1971 driving a Ferrari 512M. A year later, he persuaded Duckhams Oil to sponsor a car he commissioned Gordon Murray to design for the Le Mans race. He finished 12th overall. De Cadenet later finished third overall at Le Mans in 1976. In 1980, with co-driver Desiré Wilson, he won two rounds of the World Sportscar Championship – the Monza 1000 kilometers and Silverstone six hour events. This was a major achievement in an era of increasing professionalism, when it was very difficult for privateers to defeat larger, better-funded teams that had factory support.

==Later life==
After retiring from sports car endurance racing, de Cadenet hosted numerous shows and broadcasts for the Speed Channel, ESPN, the Velocity Channel, and the Petrolicious website. He hosted &quot;Legends of Motorsport&quot; for Speed between 1996 and 2000, as well as the network&#x27;s coverage of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

During the 2000s, he was the host of Speed&#x27;s &quot;Victory By Design&quot;, in which he drove vintage racing cars and discussed their history. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the series as &quot;car pornography&quot;. In 2012, de Cadenet hosted &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; for the Velocity Channel (now called the Motor Trend network), covering cars, motorcycles, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and racing at Monaco.

===Collecting===
De Cadenet also raced classic and vintage cars, having owned and raced numerous models, particularly Alfa Romeos. In addition to cars, he also collected motorcycles and aircraft, and operated a Supermarine Spitfire. A video on the Internet shows a clip from a documentary in which a Spitfire flies extremely low over his head. He was also a collector and authority on George V stamps, and advised the Royal Mail on their collection.

==Personal life==
De Cadenet&#x27;s first marriage was to Anna Gerrard, an interior designer and model. Together, they had two children: Alexander and Amanda. They eventually divorced. He later married Alison Larmon, with whom he had a son, Aidan. They remained married until his death.

De Cadenet died on 1 July 2022. He was 76, and suffered from cholangiocarcinoma prior to his death. He was buried at the Putney Vale Cemetery; his grave is alongside pre-war racing driver Richard Seaman.

<doc id="889657" wikidata="Q3457234" url="?curid=889657" title="Coeur d'Alene Reservation">
<text>The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation is a Native American reservation in northwestern Idaho, United States. It is home to the federally recognized Coeur d&#x27;Alene, one of the five federally recognized tribes in the state.

It is located in parts of Benewah and Kootenai counties. The land area is 523.76 sq mi (1,356.531 km2) and it had a population of 6,551 residents at the 2000 census. The largest city entirely within the reservation is Plummer, with a population of more than 1,000 in the 2010 census.

Part of the larger city of St. Maries, the county seat of Benewah County, extends onto the reservation&#x27;s eastern end. Some 734 of the city&#x27;s 2,652 residents reside in this area of the reservation.

== History and origin ==
Considered as &quot;where the old ones walked,&quot; the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation came to fruition by the tribesmen using the surrounding resources to fish and hunt. The name, &quot;Coeur d&#x27;Alene,&quot; meaning &quot;Heart of the Awl,&quot; was given from a French trapper in the late 18th or early 19th century, recognizing the high trading skill the tribe displayed.

The Coeur d&#x27;Alene territory, acquired by the United States under an 1846 treaty with Great Britain, saw numerous settlers from eastern United States move in the same decade. Following the defeat of the Indians in the Skitswish War of May–September 1858, more people were attracted to the territory after the discovery of silver in 1863 in the northern Idaho Panhandle region near the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. People eventually discovered large amounts of silver through mining in this area.

Through executive order, President Ulysses S. Grant established this reservation to be federally recognized in 1873. Ultimately, this move decreased the size of the lands to approximately 600,000 acres (940 sq. mi; 2,400 km2), where disagreement was received from the current Chief Peter Mocetelme, including a meeting between the chief and President Ulysses S. Grant. If the executive order was to be approved, 1/3 of the original Coeur d&#x27;Alene land was set to be sold to other white settlers.

The Tribe never saw a ratification of the executive order to be federally recognized or receive any compensation as of 1885. The Tribe made an effort to regain Congress&#x27; attention again in order to make an official peace treaty. Through several government actions, a boundary was put in place on the Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, eventually decreasing the size of the lands to approximately 345,000 acres (539 sq. mi; 1,400 km2).

Land disputes would still continue, and in 1997, the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Idaho v. Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe of Idaho&quot; held that the Coeur d&#x27;Alene tribe could not continue taking claim to Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene. Another similar case in 2001, &quot;Idaho v. United States&quot;, ruled in favor of the federal government.

== Geography ==
Spanning over eastern Washington, north Idaho, and western Montana, also referred to as the Panhandle region of Idaho, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene&#x27;s and the neighboring tribes originally lived on over 3.5 million acres (7812 sq. mi; 20,234 km2) of land. The region was diverse and contained numerous varied biomes, from forested mountains to marshes and lakes. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene tribe is located south of Bonner county, west of Shoshone county, and north of Benewah county. It borders Washington, being directly east of Spokane valley. At the center of the reservation was Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

The tribe hunted and gathered several fish including cutthroat trout, anadromous salmon, and steelhead. Cutthroat trout were originally harvested in the St. Joe River and the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Lake. Today, the trout only exists in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Basin to be harvested.

== Demographics ==
Consisting of over 2,190 current members, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene people were established as non-nomadic. Back from 1947 to current day, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene tribe has tribal leaders that oversee issues within the tribe. The council they presume consists of a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary-treasurer, and several council members. The chairman and vice-chairmen may interact with the federal government.

== Economy/Trading ==
Trading was at the forefront of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene, being described by a past Frenchman fur trader as &quot;the greatest traders in the world.&quot; The land provided ample amounts of resources, allowing for the tribe to be stationary and non-nomadic while being able to establish farms and a &quot;productive agriculture.&quot; Fish, quarry, waterfowl, nuts, and berries all derived from the bodies of water, mountains, grassy lands, and wetlands nearby.

The Coeur d&#x27;Alene tribe is allowed to earn money through corporate form, and all economic development and lease agreements must be approved. The tribe&#x27;s primary economic development stems from agriculture and gaming. They employ around 1,000 people in both economic sectors. The tribe produces several crops on a 6,000 acre (9.38 sq. mi; 24.28 km2) farm, but they also have farmland for turf farming and logging. For gaming, the tribe operates the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Casino, Resort, and Hotel, earning around $20 million in profit per year. Among other economic sectors, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene tribe also is involved in an automotive center, hardware center, food markets, and a medical center.

<text>Tidal is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, released on July 23, 1996, by The WORK Group. &quot;Tidal&quot; produced three singles: &quot;Shadowboxer&quot;, &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot;, and &quot;Criminal&quot;. The latter was the album&#x27;s most popular single, winning a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 1998. In 2017, &quot;Tidal&quot; got its first vinyl run as a &quot;Vinyl Me Please&quot; exclusive &quot;Record of the Month&quot;.

==Background and reception==

&quot;When I did &quot;Tidal&quot;,&quot; Apple said in 2000, &quot;it was more for the sake of proving myself; telling people from my past something. And to also try to get friends for the future.&quot;

&quot;Tidal&quot; was received well by critics, with Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describing it as a mature effort comparable to the work of singer/songwriters Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 83 among the 100 greatest albums of the 1990s. The following year, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed it at number 74. The album is featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 25 on its list of &quot;100 Best Debut Albums of All Time&quot;, claiming that it was &quot;just the beginning—and Apple has kept topping herself artistically ever since.&quot;

As of July 2016, the album has sold 2.9 million copies in United States.

<doc id="889659" wikidata="Q14475256" url="?curid=889659" title="Rosy retrospection">
<text>Rosy retrospection is a proposed psychological phenomenon of recalling the past more positively than it was actually experienced.

The highly unreliable nature of human memory is well documented and accepted amongst psychologists. Some research suggests a &#x27;blue retrospective&#x27; which also exaggerates negative emotions.

Though it is a cognitive bias which distorts one&#x27;s view of reality, it is suggested that rosy retrospection serves a useful purpose in increasing self-esteem and sense of well-being.

Simplifications and exaggerations of memories such as occur in rosy retrospection may make it easier for the brain to store long-term memories, as removing details may reduce the burden of those memories by requiring the generation and maintenance of fewer neural connections.

Declinism, the predisposition to view the past more favourably and the future more negatively, may be related to cognitive biases like rosy retrospection.

Rosy retrospection is very closely related to the concept of nostalgia though still different respectively in being rosy retrospection being biased towards perceiving the past as better than the present.

The English idiom &quot;&quot; or &quot;rose-tinted glasses&quot; refers to perceiving something more positively than it is in reality (also in , , ).

The Romans occasionally referred to this phenomenon with the Latin phrase &quot;&quot;, which translates into English roughly as &quot;memory of good past&quot;, or more idiomatically as &quot;good old days&quot;.

==Research==
In one group of experiments, three groups going on different vacations were interviewed before, during, and after their vacations. Most followed the pattern of initially positive anticipation, followed by mild disappointment thereafter. Generally, most subjects reviewed the events more favorably some time after the events had occurred than they did while experiencing them.

A 2003 pair of studies tracked 68 and 117 undergraduates, suggesting rosy retrospection is caused by high self-esteem. Participants journaled the day&#x27;s events and associated emotions each night for seven nights. They later recalled their emotions when asked about said events. Those with higher self-esteem recalled their positive emotions being stronger than they journaled. They did not also recall their negative emotions more strongly. However, this result varied in its strength and did not occur consistently.

A 1995 study tracked 30 employed adults over 2 working weeks, having them report their mood every 2 hours during their waking day, as well as end-of-day and end-of-week reflection. It suggests a rosy bias which grows with time. For positive emotions, it found that end-of-day reflections were stronger than an average of the 2-hourly ratings of that day; likewise end-of-week reflections were stronger than an average of the end-of-days. But for negative emotions, there was no such significant difference neither between the averaged hourly and daily ratings nor the averaged daily and weekly ratings.

=== Exaggeration of both negative and positive emotions ===
Some studies have found evidence of a bias to exaggerating negative emotions - a.k.a. a &#x27;blue&#x27; retrospective - as well as positive ones. 

A 2016 study of 179 adults tracked their emotional state at regular intervals over 10 days, upon reflection after one day, and again after 1-2 months. It found that for both positive and negative emotions, stronger &quot;peak&quot; emotions (the strongest rating of the day) were more likely to result in exaggerated recollections upon reflection. Unlike the study above, it did not find that this effect increased with time. It also found a negative correlation with the &quot;average&quot; rating and the exaggerated recollections; suggesting those who &quot;consistently&quot; experienced stronger emotion recall more accurately. Additionally, it found extraverted personalities were more likely to have ‘rosy’ positive bias whereas neurotic personalities were more likely to have negative &#x27;blue&#x27; bias on recall.

A 2021 work studied a group of 120 Swiss children aged about 12, later repeating the study on the same group aged about 15. For a week, the children filled in short emotional questionnaires at random points during their school day. Afterwards, they were asked to recall their week’s emotions in retrospect. Note they were asked only about the preceding week: the 15-year-olds were not asked to recall their emotions at age 12. It found evidence of a ‘rosy’ positive bias for the 12-year-olds. But this was the opposite for the 15-year-olds, who showed a &#x27;blue&#x27; negative bias instead.

A 2003 study surveyed 41 participants around the time of their vacations. Subjects predicted their emotions before vacating, reported their emotions during (in-situ), and recalled their emotions after. It indeed found a rosy effect as subjects recalled (and predicted) their positive emotions being stronger than they actually were. But it also found recollections of negative emotions were recalled and predicted more intensely than was reported at the time (as an aside, the only significant predictor of a desire to repeat a holiday was the recalled emotions, but not the predicted nor in-situ reports).

=== Limitations ===
Relying on subjective ratings, the above studies could suffer from demand characteristics: participants may guess the study&#x27;s goals and expected results, unconsciously changing their answers thinking they are &#x27;supposed&#x27; to recall their emotions inaccurately.

These studies may be vulnerable to sample biases. They rely on small samples which are more likely to be unrepresentative of the general population by unlucky chance. Many of the samples are homogenous to varying extents, with subjects often being relatively young, in education, and western. A similar sample bias may occur in the way researchers find subjects. Potentially those who come across and are appealed to join and remain in studies will be those with relatively more free-time, better education, higher wealth and income, etc. Though the studies took varying efforts to reduce this by ensuring a balance of ages, ethnicities, sexes, etc. 

These studies typically asked subjects to recall their emotions only days or weeks after an event. Thus they may predict little for rosy retrospection on the scale of months, years, and decades. 

A suggested cause of such findings may be in the social and linguistic norms of the subjects, rather than their actual emotions. Especially if a subject fails to fully recall their emotions, social convention may bias them to more positive terms in an attempt to answer. Though this raises the question as to if evidence exists or can be found of such a norm and bias.

<doc id="889661" wikidata="Q5967302" url="?curid=889661" title="I've Got a Secret">
<text>I&#x27;ve Got a Secret is an American panel game show produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman for CBS television. Created by comedy writers Allan Sherman and Howard Merrill, it was a derivative of Goodson–Todman&#x27;s own panel show, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?.&quot; Instead of celebrity panelists trying to determine a contestant&#x27;s occupation, however, as in &quot;What&#x27;s My Line,&quot; the panel tried to determine a contestant&#x27;s secret: something that is unusual, amazing, embarrassing, or humorous about that person.

The original version of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; premiered on CBS on June 19, 1952, and ran until April 3, 1967. The show began broadcasting in black and white and switched to color in 1966, when all commercial prime-time network programs in the US began to be produced in color.

The show was revived for the 1972–1973 season in once-a-week syndication and again from June 15 to July 6, 1976, as a summer replacement series on CBS. Oxygen launched a daily revival series in 2000, which ran until 2001. A second revival by GSN premiered on April 17, 2006, and aired new episodes daily until June 9, 2006.

==Hosts and panelists==
The show was originally hosted by radio and television personality Garry Moore. After several months of an ever-changing panel, game show host Bill Cullen, acerbic comedian Henry Morgan, TV hostess Faye Emerson, and actress Jayne Meadows became the four regular panelists. In 1958, Emerson left the show to star in a play and was replaced by actress Betsy Palmer. Later that year, Meadows relocated to the West Coast and was replaced by former Miss America Bess Myerson. At various times, guest hosts substituted for Moore, including panelists Cullen, Morgan and Palmer, among others. Additionally, other comedians and celebrities appeared as guests on the panel when others were away. The announcer for most of the 1952–67 run was John Cannon.

Moore left the show after the 1963–64 season. After his comedy program &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; was canceled, Moore chose to retire from television to travel the world with his wife. Moore was replaced by Steve Allen, who left his own syndicated talk show to take over the game, on September 21, 1964. Allen also hosted the show during the 1972−73 revival. Former panelist Bill Cullen hosted the show for its brief 1976 CBS summer run. Frequent panelists on this revival were Richard Dawson, Henry Morgan, Pat Carroll, and Elaine Joyce.

The version seen on Oxygen was hosted by Stephanie Miller from January 2000 until August 2001. Regular panelists on this version included Jim J. Bullock, Jason Kravits, Amy Yasbeck, and Teri Garr.

The GSN version was hosted by Bil Dwyer and, unlike the earlier versions, featured a permanent panel that appeared on each episode, consisting of Billy Bean, Frank DeCaro, Jermaine Taylor, and Suzanne Westenhoefer.

==Original series==
===Gameplay===
Each typical episode featured two regular contestant rounds, followed by a celebrity guest round, occasionally followed by an additional regular round.

====Standard rounds====
Each round was a guessing game in which the panel tried to determine a contestant&#x27;s secret. The concept of a secret was fairly broad. Secrets were always intended to be unusual, amazing, embarrassing, or humorous. They commonly included something that happened to the contestant, something owned by the contestant, or a notable occupation, hobby, achievement, or skill.

Each show began with the entrance of one or more contestants. The host then introduced the contestant or asked his or her name and hometown. He then asked them to &quot;whisper your secret to me, and we&#x27;ll show it to the folks at home.&quot; The contestant then ostensibly whispered the secret, while the audience and viewers were shown the secret as a text overlay on the screen. Then the host gave the panel a clue – for example, &quot;the secret concerns something that happened to [contestant&#x27;s name].&quot; The host then selected a panelist to begin questioning.

When the show debuted, each panelist had 15 seconds of questioning at a time, running through the panel twice, in order. Each segment of questioning which passed without the panelist guessing the secret won the contestant $10, for a top prize of $80. In mid-1954, the format changed to only once around the panel, with a $20 prize for each panelist stumped. The time limit was no longer fixed, and the buzzer which ended questioning was instead at the discretion of the production staff. This was due, in part, to the program airing live, and sometimes requiring to lengthen or shorten the time allowed for questioning in order to keep the show running on time. Increasingly later in the run, the panelists were sometimes buzzed out when they were getting too close to the secret, were suspected to be about to get it, or simply at a point that would get a laugh; this was precipitated in part by the fact that, like &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, the top payoff never increased with inflation, and the money eventually became somewhat secondary to the gameplay, with the cash awards not even mentioned at all by the end of the series. Similarly, the panelist chosen to question first eventually became a strategy by the producers. When a secret fell within an area that a panelist was knowledgeable on (most commonly Cullen with mechanical, scientific or sports secrets), they would often be chosen first, to give them no preceding clues during their questioning. On occasion when a secret referenced a panelist, the order was usually chosen to put them last.

Following the revelation of a guest&#x27;s secret, either by guessing or by the host&#x27;s revelation once the game was over, the host typically either interviewed the contestant about their secret, or, if applicable, the contestant did some kind of demonstration of their secret. These demonstrations sometimes included the host, and occasionally one or more of the panelists.

Beyond the standard celebrity guests, several notable people with secrets appeared, including Colonel Harland Sanders (&quot;I started my restaurant with my first Social Security check&quot;), drummer Pete Best (&quot;I used to be one of The Beatles&quot;), and a 95-year-old man, Samuel J. Seymour, who was the last surviving eyewitness to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination (he was five years old at the time). In 1958, an episode devoted to the theme of &quot;teenage appreciation&quot; was the show&#x27;s answer to media reports of teenage delinquency, and featured nine teenagers of unusual accomplishment including the then 15-year-old chess champion Bobby Fischer, 16-year-old pop star Paul Anka, and 19-year-old college basketball star Oscar Robertson. Sgt. Ira Jones, who served as Elvis Presley&#x27;s First Sergeant in Germany, made an appearance. Scientist Philo T. Farnsworth, the inventor of electronic television, made his only televised appearance as a contestant on the show.

====Guest rounds====

On each typical episode, a celebrity guest came on the show with a secret. The celebrity usually opened the episode by coming out from the behind the curtain and saying &quot;my name is [Name] and I&#x27;ve Got a Secret!&quot;, though sometimes they would say &quot;and this is &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;!&quot;. Early in the show&#x27;s run, the celebrities would indeed have actual personal secrets similar to the other contestants. However, producer Allan Sherman later admitted that these celebrity &quot;secrets&quot; (such as Boris Karloff being afraid of mice) were frequently concocted by the show&#x27;s staff, and the celebrities merely played along.

The celebrity &quot;secret&quot; was slowly phased out during the mid-1950s, as an increasingly common activity for the celebrity guest was to challenge the panel in some sort of alternate game. Eventually, this became the primary use of the guest segment, and the pretense of having the panel guess the guest&#x27;s secret was dropped altogether. The guest would simply come out with a challenge for the panel; sometimes ostensibly related to the guest or their current project, but other times not related to the guest at all. Several of these challenges predated future game shows which used the same concepts, such as a game in which Woody Allen challenged the panel to guess words based on definitions written by children, which became the basis for &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, and a pair of segments with Peter Falk and Soupy Sales in which the panel had to identify celebrities based on a series of photos starting with infancy and progressing older. which featured in the format of the show &quot;Face the Music&quot;.

Often, secrets would involve Henry Morgan in some manner. Since Morgan had a &quot;lovable sourpuss&quot; personality, he attracted a certain &quot;let&#x27;s see how we can &#x27;get&#x27; Henry this time&quot; playfulness from the writers. Sometimes he would be sent on week-long trips (often starting as soon as the live broadcast ended) which would be filmed and highlights shown the following week. Some of these trips: being sent to England to buy a proper English Christmas meal from a famous English restaurant, while dressed in a stereotypical English derby and morning coat; spending a week at Roy Rogers&#x27; dude ranch as a hired hand; accompanying a mathematician to a Las Vegas casino, to test a new, theoretical method of gambling; and going on an African safari with Ann Sheridan (which started immediately, as Morgan received inoculations and his passport photo on stage). Henry was also recruited as a background spear holder at the Metropolitan Opera, a dead body in a murder-mystery Broadway play, a Santa Claus for disadvantaged kids, and a radio announcer who bravely read his script while the other panelists distracted him mercilessly. A Halloween episode had Arnold Stang taking the stage in a traditional &quot;bedsheet&quot; ghost costume with the secret &quot;This costume was made from Henry Morgan&#x27;s bedsheet.&quot; After the game Moore said &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Henry, we promise to put these back where we found them,&quot; at which point the center stage curtain rose to reveal Morgan&#x27;s own bed.

&quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; was host to many notable guests over the course of the show&#x27;s run.
===History and style===
&quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; was more informal than sister show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in most respects. The panel and host were generally on a first-name basis. As noted, the formal time limit on questioning was removed early in the show&#x27;s run, and time limits were set more for entertainment. The men on the panel always wore normal suits or even sport jackets, though both Morgan and Moore often chose bow ties over straight ties. Until the later years of the series, both Moore and members of the panel smoked cigarettes on the air, with Moore doing so right up until his last episode. The panel was introduced at the start of each episode by the host, usually with a series of descriptive puns.

Only yes-or-no questions were supposed to be asked by the panel, but the format was often relaxed, and other questions slipped through. Unlike on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, the host often offered hints and suggestions when the panel was off in the wrong direction, or when an answer might be misleading. Unlike on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, the panelists were not allowed to formally confer with each other, though later in the series, there was no chastising of the panelists for whispering ideas to each other.

The series began in black-and-white, and only in 1966 switched regularly to color, though like most programs of this era, existing recordings are in black and white. The series was sponsored for most of its run, with the opening of the show featuring a promotion for whichever company was the sponsor, signage on the set, and commercials being included during the show. Some sponsors provided samples of their wares for each contestant, in addition to their winnings. Late in the series&#x27; run, sponsorship was discontinued.

&quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; was, along with &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, canceled in a mass axing of CBS&#x27;s remaining panel shows in 1967; the shows were still financially successful but were not drawing good ratings, especially among the key demographics. Of the three, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; was the only one not to continue uninterrupted in some other form. (&quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; moved to syndication, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; continued as a daytime series.) Then-host Steve Allen would return to his syndicated talk show the next year.

The series itself had a cameo in the 1959 film &quot;It Happened to Jane&quot;, in which the title character appears as a contestant on the show. Moore and the entire panel played themselves in the fictional episode of the show.

In January 1960, as a result of Goodson-Todman&#x27;s sale, the show became a production of Telecast Enterprises, Inc., which was co-owned by CBS and Moore.

In 1992, Carsey-Werner attempted to revive the show for the fall of 1993 and quite possibly pair it up with the Bill Cosby revival of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; in syndication. However, plans for it fell through at the last minute. Thus, it never made it to air. Also, this was the only version of the show never to have announced a permanent host or its four panelists for the show at all.

In March 2023, it was announced that Embassy Row, Werner Entertainment and Game Show Enterprises Studios would be producing an hour-long pilot for a potential revival, with Katie Nolan as host. The panelists for the pilot include Nikki Glaser, Colton Dunn, Cristela Alonzo and Matteo Lane.

===Merchandise===
A home game of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, featuring host Garry Moore on the cover of the box, was released in 1956 by the Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation of New York City.

==Changes in the revivals==
===1970s revivals===
The format of the 1970s revivals were essentially unchanged from the original series, though celebrity secrets, rather than challenges to the panel (whose members changed weekly), did return. Richard Dawson served as a regular panelist on both versions in the 1970s, with actress Pat Carroll also making frequent panel appearances, and Henry Morgan appeared as a panelist a few times as well.

===Oxygen revival===
On the Oxygen revival, panelists had 45 seconds each for the questioning. The contestant earned $250 for each stumped panelist, and stumping the entire panel earned a total of $1,000 for the challenger. Stephanie Miller hosted this version and the show&#x27;s set resembled an upscale city apartment. The Oxygen revival ran for over 120 episodes. Steve Allen (in one of his last major appearances before his passing) and Betsy Palmer both made special guest appearances on one episode.

===GSN revival===
On GSN&#x27;s revival, each panelist had 40 seconds for questioning, with one conference allowed. Stumping the entire panel won the contestant $1,000 and dinner for two in Beverly Hills. The disclaimer at the end of the program disclosed that contestants were also paid an appearance fee. Losing contestants also received some unspecified parting gifts. Several minor show business professionals demonstrated their performances on the show, including piano juggler Dan Menendez. Another element in the revival was that all the panelists were openly gay, but this was generally only referenced in double entendres, such as when host Bil Dwyer was introduced as &quot;the straight man to the panel&quot;.

==Episode status==
As with &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, some early episodes from the original series&#x27; first season in 1952 appear to have been lost. From late 1952 until the 1967 cancellation, most episodes appear to exist as a digital transfer of the original black-and-white kinescope films. However, the premiere episode, which featured a drastically different set-up, is presumed to be lost.

===GSN===
A good portion of the series is unlikely to be aired, due to the show&#x27;s longtime sponsorship by Winston cigarettes, which remains an existing brand, and that cigarette advertisements on radio and television have been banned since January 1971. In fact, the prize on the 1956 episode about Samuel J. Seymour, who witnessed the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, included $80 () and a carton of Winston cigarettes. Seymour did not smoke cigarettes, so he was given Prince Albert pipe tobacco instead. It is unclear whether this is mandated legally, or simply a choice by GSN; GSN had aired many Winston-sponsored episodes in previous years. In addition, the network skipped several episodes through its run which are known to have been skipped in previous runs of the show; this may mean that other episodes are lost or in bad enough condition for GSN not to air them.

All subsequent revivals of &quot;Secret&quot; exist in their entirety, except for the 1976 run, whose status is currently unknown, though the pilot episode (that also aired as the premiere) for that version is currently available for viewing on YouTube. The finale is also available in audio. GSN has occasionally aired single episodes from the 1972–73 syndicated version.

===Buzzr===
The over-the-air digital channel Buzzr, owned by Fremantle, has aired the program in a two-hour block, with &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. Each episode airs uncut, including the original commercials (excluding the cigarette commercials), in a 40-minute slot.

==Nielsen ratings==
Between 1952 and 1967, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; ranked among the top 30 television shows for ten out of fifteen seasons, peaking at #5 during the 1957–58 season.

==Theme music==
The first theme used on the show from 1952 to 1961 was &quot;Plink, Plank, Plunk!&quot;, by Leroy Anderson (this theme can be heard on the album &quot;Classic TV Game Show Themes&quot;; however, the theme on the CD was credited to Norman Paris).

The second theme, used from 1961 to 1963, was an upbeat arrangement of the &quot;Theme from A Summer Place&quot;, by Max Steiner.

The third theme was used from 1963 to 1967. It was an upbeat, spritely march featuring piccolo and xylophone, composed by the show&#x27;s musical director Norman Paris and played by a live studio combo. It quoted a familiar melody widely associated with schoolyard taunts, to which the words &quot;I&#x27;ve got a secret!&quot; might be sung by children in a teasing manner.

In addition to being used as a tag for his entrance on CBS episodes he hosted, Steve Allen&#x27;s composition &quot;This Could Be the Start of Something&quot; was used as the opening theme in 1972 arranged by Edd Kalehoff for Score Productions. The closing theme to the 1972 version was also written by Kalehoff.

Tim Mosher and Stoker are credited with the 2000 theme, while Alan Ett and Scott Liggett contributed an up jazz theme for Bil Dwyer&#x27;s 2006 version of the show for GSN.

==International versions==

An Australian version of the show was produced and aired in Brisbane on QTQ Channel 9 from 1967 to 1973. It was hosted by newsreader Don Seccombe; and, like its American inspiration, featured regular celebrity panelists including Ron Cadee, Babette Stevens and Joy Chambers (future wife of Australian game show impresario Reg Grundy).

A different Australian version aired in Melbourne in 1956, with Eric Pearce as host. It debuted during the first week of television programming in that city and opening night for television station HSV 7 (November 4) with American actress, Jean Moorhead, as a guest panellist. During its run, it featured regular panelists such as Olive Wykes, Shirley Cecil, John Frith, Freddie Bowler and Jack Dyer. It is not clear when that particular version ended, but it was still running in 1958. It is not known if any kinescopes exist of this version.

A Japanese version aired on NHK from 1955 to 1967 called &quot;My Secret&quot;, hosted by Keizo Takahashi.

French network TF1 aired &quot;J&#x27;ai un Secret&quot; between 1982 and 1983, hosted by Pierre Bellemare.

Two versions were produced in the United Kingdom. The first was produced by Associated-Rediffusion and aired on ITV in 1956. This version was hosted by American-born Ben Lyon. The second version aired on BBC1 from 1984 to 1988, hosted by Tom O&#x27;Connor.

<text>I Wanna Date a Race Car Driver is a reality television show on Speed Channel. hosted by Scott Lasky, the format was similar to ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, although contestants competed for dates with racing stars, like NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series driver Jon Wood, and not for their hand in marriage. The show, which debuted in June 2004, was immediately panned by the network&#x27;s viewers, who complained that the Fox Network-owned channel was sinking to a low level by caving into the reality dating shows that are so popular in the present day.

The show disappeared from SPEED&#x27;s lineup in late Summer of 2004, never to return.</text><links>

<text>U.S. Highway 87 (US 87) is a north–south United States highway (though it is signed east–west in New Mexico) that runs for 2,005 miles (3,215 km) from northern Montana to southern Texas, making it the longest north-south road to not have a &quot;1&quot; in its number and the third longest north-south road in the country, behind U.S. 41 and U.S. 1. Most of the portion from Billings, Montana to Raton, New Mexico is co-signed along Interstates 90 and 25. It is also co-signed along the majority of I-27 in Texas and future plans call for the interstate to be extended along the US 87 corridor. As of 2004, the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Havre, Montana, at US 2 and its southern terminus is in Port Lavaca, Texas, at SH 238.

==Route description==

===Texas===

In Texas, US 87 is a north–south highway that begins near the Gulf Coast in Port Lavaca, Texas, and heads north through San Antonio, Lubbock, Amarillo, and Dalhart to the New Mexico border near Texline.

===New Mexico===
US 87 continues in a northwesterly direction in New Mexico and is signed by NMDOT primarily as an east–west route. It merges with US-64 (and thus the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway) in Clayton, shortly after entering New Mexico. It continues to the northwest until Des Moines, when it takes a more westerly approach to Raton. In Raton, it separates from US 64 and merges with Interstate 25 and US 85, with which it remains concurrent through Raton Pass and into Colorado, though it is unsigned on much of the concurrency.

===Colorado===

US 87 remains concurrent with I-25 throughout the state of Colorado, which is a rare occurrence for a US highway to have a concurrency with an Interstate in its entirety within state boundaries. It is unsigned through the entire state.

===Wyoming===
US 87 remains concurrent with Interstate 25 northward until exit 160 east of Glenrock where it joins US Route 20/US Route 26 from Glenrock to Casper. In Casper it splits from US-20/26 and rejoins I-25 at exit 186. It then remains concurrent with Interstate 25 northward until its terminus with Interstate 90. It then follows I-90 west to exit 44 where it runs up to Sheridan. A portion of US-87 has been washed out for several years along this stretch and &quot;temporary&quot; detour signs are posted directing US-87 traffic along Wyoming Highway 193 through Story. In Sheridan US-87 rejoins Interstate 90 into Montana.

===Montana===

US 87 remains concurrent with Interstate 90 westward until Billings, where it breaks off and heads north. Between Crow Agency and Billings, US 87 and I-90 are merged with US 212. It intersects with (and briefly merges with) US 12 in Roundup and continues north with a slight bend to the northwest until, at Grass Range it takes a sharp turn to the west at an intersection with Montana State Highway 200. US 87 remains concurrent with Montana State Highway 200 until Great Falls. In Lewistown, it merges with US 191 and remains heading generally west. Some ten miles (16 km) out of Lewistown, it breaks with US 191 and merges with Montana State Highway 3, heading generally northwest and merging briefly with US 89 before breaking with all three in Great Falls. US 87 heads northeast then east to Fort Benton and then generally northeast to its terminus with US 2 about two miles (3 km) west of Havre.

==History==
US 87 originally ran northwest out of Great Falls, Montana, towards the eastern border of Glacier National Park. US 87 ran to the Canadian Border at the Piegan Border Crossing. This was changed in 1934, when US Route 89 was diverted to US 87&#x27;s routing to Glacier Park. US 87 ended in Great Falls until circa 1945 when it was extended to its current northern terminus in Havre, Montana.

U.S. Route 185 was formed in 1926 and extended from US 85 in Cheyenne north to Orin. It became part of a southern extension and realignment of US 87 in 1936.

==Future==
On March 15, 2022, a bill was signed by President Joe Biden that added the extension of I-27 from its termini in Amarillo and Lubbock, Texas, northward to Raton, New Mexico, and southward to Laredo, Texas, respectively to the Interstate Highway System utilizing the US 87 corridor. The interstate&#x27;s northern terminus would be at I-25. A bill introduced in 2023 would explicitly designate the extension as I-27 with two auxiliary routes numbered I-227 and I-327. I-227 is proposed to be routed via SH 158 from Sterling City to Midland and SH 349 from Midland to Lamesa; I-327 would utilize US 287 from Dumas to the Oklahoma border. However, after legislation passed through the U.S. Senate in August 2023, I-227 and I-327 were respectively redesignated as I-27W and I-27N, with I-27E replacing the proposed I-27 between Sterling City and Lamesa.

<text>Room (formerly Room of One&#x27;s Own) is a Canadian quarterly literary journal that features the work of emerging and established women and genderqueer writers and artists. Launched in Vancouver in 1975 by the West Coast Feminist Literary Magazine Society, or the Growing Room Collective, the journal has published an estimated 3,000 women, serving as an important launching pad for emerging writers. &quot;Room&quot; publishes short fiction, creative non-fiction, poetry, art, feature interviews, and features that promote dialogue between readers, writers and the collective, including &quot;Roommate&quot; (a profile of a &quot;Room&quot; reader or collective member) and &quot;The Back Room&quot; (back page interviews on feminist topics of interest). Collective members are regular participants in literary and arts festivals in Greater Vancouver and Toronto.

==History==
The journal&#x27;s original title (1975-2006) &quot;Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; came from Virginia Woolf&#x27;s essay &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;. In 2007, the collective relaunched the magazine as &quot;Room&quot;, reflecting a more outward-facing, conversational editorial mandate; however, the original name and its inspiration is reflected in a quote from the Woolf essay that always appears on the back cover of the magazine.

&quot;Room&quot; magazine has always been operated by an editorial collective. Former collective members include author Gayla Reid, CBC broadcaster Eleanor Wachtel, University of British Columbia Press editor Jean Wilson, and &quot;Geist&quot; senior editor Mary Schendlinger.

Works that originally appeared in &quot;Room&quot; have been anthologized the &quot;Journey Prize Anthology&quot;, &quot;Best Canadian Poetry&quot;, &quot;Best Canadian Essays&quot;, and &quot;Best Canadian Stories&quot;, and have been nominated for National Magazine Awards.

Approximately 90% of the content &quot;Room&quot; publishes comes from unsolicited submissions.

==Notable contributors==
Past contributors to &quot;Room&quot; include Marian Engel, Carol Shields, Eden Robinson, Nalo Hopkinson, Larissa Lai, Lorna Crozier, Evelyn Lau, Ivan Coyote, Audrey Thomas, Kate Braid, Souvankham Thammavongsa, Susan Point, Hiromi Goto, Susan Musgrave, Shani Mootoo, Elizabeth Hay, Karen Solie, Erín Moure, Yasuko Thanh, Cynthia Flood, Gail Anderson-Dargatz, M. NourbeSe Philip, Daphne Marlatt, Bronwen Wallace, Carmen Aguirre, Ayelet Tsabari, Nancy Richler, Eliza Robertson, Carmen Rodríguez, Marie Annharte Baker, Betsy Warland, Lydia Kwa, and Elizabeth Bachinsky, among many other acclaimed writers and artists. Recent issues have included interviews with Ursula K. Le Guin, Miriam Toews, Joy Kogawa, Lisa Charleyboy, Stacey McKenzie, d&#x27;bi young, Jillian Tamaki, Janie Chang, and Mariko Tamaki.

==Writing contests==
&quot;Room&quot; currently offers four writing contests, which are open to both Canadian and international writers who identify as women or genderqueer. The deadline for the fiction and poetry contests is in mid-July, while the deadline for the creative non-fiction contest is currently on 8 March, which is also International Women&#x27;s Day. The creative non-fiction contest was originally added to the other two genres in 2008, and moved to the March deadline starting in 2015.

In 2016, &quot;Room&quot; launched their first Short Forms Contest, a multi-genre / genre-blending contest for flash fiction, flash CNF, and prose poetry of 500 words and under, with an inaugural deadline of 15 January 2017.

In addition to offering contests, &quot;Room&quot; presents one contributor each year with a $500 Emerging Writer Award.

==Cover art contest==
In 2015, &quot;Room&quot; introduced a cover art contest with a deadline of 30 November.

== &quot;Making Room: Forty Years of Room Magazine&quot; ==
In 2017, &quot;Room&quot; published the anthology, &quot;Making Room: Forty Years of Room Magazine&quot;. The anthology contains a selection of works featured in &quot;Room&quot; between 1975 and 2016. The anthology is broken up chronologically and follows Canadian feminist writing throughout different eras of feminism. 80 pieces are featured in &quot;Making Room&quot;. The &quot;Making Room&quot; project was coordinated by Meghan Bell.

== Growing Room Festival ==
&quot;Room&quot; launched Growing Room: A Feminist Literary Festival in 2017. The first festival was planned to celebrate both &quot;Room&quot;&#x27;s 40th anniversary and International Women&#x27;s Day and ran from 8 to 12 March in Vancouver, British Columbia. Growing Room features panels and from female and genderqueer Canadian writers as well as dancing and music.

The 2018 iteration of Growing Room was held from 1 to 4 March of that year. The 2019 festival was held from 8 to 17 March and featured approximately 100 writers and over 50 events. Growing Room 2020 was cancelled due to COVID-19.

<doc id="889672" wikidata="Q1345671" url="?curid=889672" title="Tropical disease">
<text>Tropical diseases are diseases that are prevalent in or unique to tropical and subtropical regions. The diseases are less prevalent in temperate climates, due in part to the occurrence of a cold season, which controls the insect population by forcing hibernation. However, many were present in northern Europe and northern America in the 17th and 18th centuries before modern understanding of disease causation. The initial impetus for tropical medicine was to protect the health of colonial settlers, notably in India under the British Raj. Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or vector. These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals. Most often disease is transmitted by an insect bite, which causes transmission of the infectious agent through subcutaneous blood exchange. Vaccines are not available for most of the diseases listed here, and many do not have cures.

Human exploration of tropical rainforests, deforestation, rising immigration and increased international air travel and other tourism to tropical regions has led to an increased incidence of such diseases to non-tropical countries. Of particular concern is the habitat loss of reservoir host species.

== Health programmes ==
In 1975 the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established to focus on neglected infectious diseases which disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations in developing regions of Africa, Asia, Central America and North South America. It was established at the World Health Organization, which is the executing agency, and is co-sponsored by the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund, United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank and the World Health Organization.

TDR&#x27;s vision is to foster an effective global research effort on infectious diseases of poverty in which disease endemic countries play a pivotal role. It has a dual mission of developing new tools and strategies against these diseases, and to develop the research and leadership capacity in the countries where the diseases occur. The TDR secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, but the work is conducted throughout the world through many partners and funded grants.

Some examples of work include helping to develop new treatments for diseases, such as ivermectin for onchocerciasis (river blindness); showing how packaging can improve use of artemesinin-combination treatment (ACT) for malaria; demonstrating the effectiveness of bednets to prevent mosquito bites and malaria; and documenting how community-based and community-led programmes increases distribution of multiple treatments. TDR history

The current TDR disease portfolio includes the following entries:
:† 

==Other neglected tropical diseases==
Additional neglected tropical diseases include:

Some tropical diseases are very rare, but may occur in sudden epidemics, such as the Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever and the Marburg virus. There are hundreds of different tropical diseases which are less known or rarer, but that, nonetheless, have importance for public health.

==Relation of climate to tropical diseases==
The so-called &quot;exotic&quot; diseases in the tropics have long been noted both by travelers, explorers, etc., as well as by physicians. One obvious reason is that the hot climate present during all the year and the larger volume of rains directly affect the formation of breeding grounds, the larger number and variety of natural reservoirs and animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans (zoonosis), the largest number of possible insect vectors of diseases. It is possible also that higher temperatures may favor the replication of pathogenic agents both inside and outside biological organisms. Socio-economic factors may be also in operation, since most of the poorest nations of the world are in the tropics. Tropical countries like Brazil, which have improved their socio-economic situation and invested in hygiene, public health and the combat of transmissible diseases have achieved dramatic results in relation to the elimination or decrease of many endemic tropical diseases in their territory.

Climate change, global warming caused by the greenhouse effect, and the resulting increase in global temperatures, are possibly causing tropical diseases and vectors to spread to higher altitudes in mountainous regions, and to higher latitudes that were previously spared, such as the Southern United States, the Mediterranean area, etc. For example, in the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica, global warming enabled Chytridiomycosis, a tropical disease, to flourish and thus force into decline amphibian populations of the Monteverde Harlequin frog. Here, global warming raised the heights of orographic cloud formation, and thus produced cloud cover that would facilitate optimum growth conditions for the implicated pathogen, B. dendrobatidis.

==Prevention and treatment==
=== Vector-borne diseases ===
Vectors are living organisms that pass disease between humans or from animal to human. The vector carrying the highest number of diseases is the mosquito, which is responsible for the tropical diseases dengue and malaria. Many different approaches have been taken to treat and prevent these diseases. NIH-funded research has produced genetically modify mosquitoes that are unable to spread diseases such as malaria. An issue with this approach is global accessibility to genetic engineering technology; Approximately 50% of scientists in the field do not have access to information on genetically modified mosquito trials being conducted.

Other prevention methods include:
* Draining wetlands to reduce populations of insects and other vectors, or introducing natural predators of the vectors.
* The application of insecticides and/or insect repellents to strategic surfaces such as clothing, skin, buildings, insect habitats, and bed nets.
* The use of a mosquito net over a bed (also known as a &quot;bed net&quot;) to reduce nighttime transmission, since certain species of tropical mosquitoes feed mainly at night.

=== Community approaches ===
Assisting with economic development in endemic regions can contribute to prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. For example, microloans enable communities to invest in health programs that lead to more effective disease treatment and prevention technology.

Educational campaigns can aid in the prevention of various diseases. Educating children about how diseases spread and how they can be prevented has proven to be effective in practicing preventative measures. Educational campaigns can yield significant benefits at low costs.

=== Other approaches ===
* Use of water wells, and/or water filtration, water filters, or water treatment with water tablets to produce drinking water free of parasites.
* Sanitation to prevent transmission through human waste.
* Development and use of vaccines to promote disease immunity.
* Pharmacologic treatment (to treat disease after infection or infestation).

<doc id="889674" wikidata="Q5148105" url="?curid=889674" title="Colonel Cathcart">
<text>Colonel Cathcart is a character in Joseph Heller&#x27;s novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1961) and the novel&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; main antagonist.

A full colonel, he is a group commander at a U.S. Army Air Forces base in Pianosa and is obsessed with becoming a general. As such, he does whatever it takes to please his superiors—in particular, by repeatedly raising the number of missions the men have to fly to complete a tour of duty, beyond that normally ordered by other outfits. This becomes the bane of Yossarian&#x27;s life, as every time he comes close to obtaining the target number of missions for being sent home, Colonel Cathcart raises the required number again.

Cathcart himself has only flown in two missions, one of which was accidental.

==Feathers and black eyes==
Cathcart nightly makes lists of &quot;feathers in his cap&quot; and &quot;black eyes&quot;, often finding something in the former category is in fact in the latter one, considering all the possible ways in which his superiors could react to them. In his attempts to please nearly everyone, Cathcart discovers that all the other soldiers hate him. This perception lives largely in his mind, but it affects his relationships with the others and they soon begin to actually dislike and/or avoid him. His paranoia, matched only by his arrogance, worsens throughout the course of the novel.

==Catch-22==
The concept of Catch-22 is also represented in the character of Colonel Cathcart (whose name is an anagram for both &quot;catch art&quot; and &quot;rat catch&quot;), as he consists entirely of irreconcilable oppositions and maintains an illogical thought process that echoes that of the catch. Cathcart is a master of political doublespeak, often completely contradicting what he says seconds after he says it, usually when a superior officer disagrees with him.

==Yossarian==
Cathcart hates Yossarian almost as much as Yossarian hates him. When Yossarian publicly refuses to fly any more missions, Cathcart moves to have him court martialed, but his right-hand man, Colonel Korn, talks him out of it, advising him that a dismissal from the Air Force is exactly what he wants; Cathcart instead decorates him to ensure that he will stay in the service.

When Yossarian is caught AWOL in Rome, Cathcart is eager to have him court martialed and imprisoned, but Korn once again persuades him to offer him the credit for enough missions to send him home instead, to hush the whole affair up. Yossarian briefly considers the offer, but changes his mind when he hears that Orr got out of duty by escaping to Sweden.

==Film==
In Mike Nichols&#x27; 1970 film adaptation of the novel, Colonel Cathcart is portrayed by Martin Balsam. In the 2019 TV miniseries adaptation, he is portrayed by Kyle Chandler.

<doc id="889676" wikidata="Q2338429" url="?curid=889676" title="Paul Tobias">
<text>Paul Tobias (also known as Paul Edward Huge (pronounced hugh-gee); born August 1963) is an American guitarist best known for his work with the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he was associated from 1994 to 2002.

== Biography ==
Born in August 1963 in Indianapolis, Tobias grew up in Lafayette and is a childhood friend of Axl Rose. Following the formation of Rose&#x27;s band Hollywood Rose in 1983, the band&#x27;s demo tape featured two songs co-written by Rose and Tobias: &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; and &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot;. In 1985, Rose formed Guns N&#x27; Roses and released their debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, in 1987. While &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; was re-recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions, it did not make the final tracklist, though Tobias was thanked in the album&#x27;s credits. The song was later released as a B-side of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy/Mr. Brownstone&quot;.

In 1991, a re-recorded version of &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot; was featured on Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; third studio album, &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;. Rose stated in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1992 that the song was ten years old at that time. In late 1994, Tobias joined Guns N&#x27; Roses as a replacement for Gilby Clarke and played rhythm and lead guitar on the band&#x27;s cover version of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;. While Tobias contributed to the song at Rose&#x27;s request, his inclusion caused friction between Rose and the band&#x27;s then-lead guitarist Slash due to an overdub made by Tobias of Slash&#x27;s solo on the track.

Tobias would go on to work and record with Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1996, when the band began working on their sixth studio album. His role in the band was not clarified publicly at the time, as it was uncertain whether he would eventually feature on the album and subsequent tours as a rhythm guitarist. Rose further explained that the intention behind bringing in Tobias was to help the band in the studio:

&quot;The public gets a different story from the other guys – Slash, Duff, Matt – who have their own agendas. The original intentions between Paul and myself were that Paul was going to help me for as long as it took to get this thing together in whatever capacity that he could help me in. So when he first was brought into this, he was brought in as a writer to work with Slash. At the time those guys never suggested one name.&quot;

In 1997, Tobias began working for Guns N&#x27; Roses full-time in a studio setting, jamming and recording song ideas with keyboardist Dizzy Reed and then-lead guitarist Robin Finck, among others. During these sessions, Tobias and Reed wrote the song &quot;Oh My God&quot;, which was later featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 film &quot;End of Days&quot;. In January 2001, Tobias made his live debut with Guns N&#x27; Roses as the band played their first concerts in eight years at Las Vegas&#x27;s House of Blues and Rock in Rio III. Rose introduced Tobias on stage at both shows as someone who had helped him keep the band together during the past years. In Rio, Rose also noted that Tobias had previously played live only a handful of times. The band played their next two concerts in December 2001, also in Las Vegas, which marked Tobias&#x27; last appearances as a band member.

In mid-2002, due to his aversion to touring, Tobias was replaced in the band by Richard Fortus. At the time, it was not officially stated that Tobias had left Guns N&#x27; Roses. During that same year, Tobias&#x27; other band, Mank Rage, expressed interest in releasing an album consisting of material recorded prior to his tenure with Guns N&#x27; Roses. In July 2006, several of the band&#x27;s demos were posted on MySpace. In 2008, Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, and Tobias was credited as a co-writer on seven songs, in addition to contributing arrangements, and guitar and piano parts. In 2018, Tobias was again associated with Guns N&#x27; Roses when &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; was released as a single and included on the deluxe edition of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. He received further writing credits for the band&#x27;s singles &quot;Hard Skool&quot; and &quot;Perhaps&quot;, released in 2021 and 2023, respectively.

<text>Richard Fortus (born November 17, 1966) is an American guitarist. He is a member of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he has recorded one studio album, since 2002. Fortus has also collaborated extensively with The Psychedelic Furs frontman Richard Butler and fellow Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Frank Ferrer. Aside from lead singer Axl Rose and keyboardist Dizzy Reed, Fortus is the longest-tenured member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, having been with the band continuously since 2002.

Alongside his work in Guns N&#x27; Roses, Fortus is a former member of Love Spit Love, Thin Lizzy, and The Dead Daisies.

==Career==

===Early life and beginning career===
Fortus was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He began learning violin at 4 years old and the drums a year later.

Fortus studied at the Conservatory of the Arts in St. Louis and Southern Illinois University and also played in several youth symphonies in the St. Louis area.

===The Eyes/Pale Divine (1984–91)===
Fortus founded the band The Eyes in 1984. The four-piece alternative band independently released &quot;Freedom in a Cage&quot;, which was produced by David Probst. After signing with Atlantic Records, they changed their name to Pale Divine. They subsequently toured the U.S. in support of their only album, &quot;Straight to Goodbye&quot;, opening for The Psychedelic Furs.

===Love Spit Love and the Psychedelic Furs (1992–2000)===

After the Psychedelic Furs split up, Fortus formed Love Spit Love with Richard Butler and Frank Ferrer in 1992. When the Furs re-formed in 2000, Fortus joined the group as second guitarist and played on the live album &quot;Beautiful Chaos: Greatest Hits Live&quot;. Love Spit Love went on an indefinite hiatus soon after.

Loup Garou (1995–98)

Fortus joined this NYC outfit for club dates and festivals over a three-year hitch that included dates in Europe and culminated with the recording of the band&#x27;s third CD, &quot;Ten Wines from Job&#x27;s Vineyard&quot;.

===Guns N&#x27; Roses (2002–present)===

In 1999, Fortus was contacted by Guns N&#x27; Roses to audition as a potential replacement for the departing Robin Finck. However, the spot was ultimately filled by Buckethead. In 2002, guitarist Paul Tobias left Guns N&#x27; Roses, citing stress with touring. Fortus was touring Europe as guitarist for Enrique Iglesias in May 2002 when he got a call from his friend (and Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist) Tommy Stinson asking him to fly out to audition for the band. Fortus joined Guns N&#x27; Roses officially in July 2002.

In Guns N&#x27; Roses, Fortus plays both rhythm guitar and occasional lead guitar. Lead singer Axl Rose is very pleased with Fortus&#x27;s work and has said, &quot;He&#x27;s an amazing lead player and very technically skilled. He really likes the pocket that Brain sets and the two of them click with Tommy so we finally have the real deal rhythm section, as Richard is a proven professional. Basically, Richard&#x27;s the guy that we always were looking for.&quot;

Fortus recorded guitars for the band&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; and appears on the live release &quot;Appetite for Democracy 3D&quot;.

Fortus has been present at every tour since 2002, most recently at the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, playing alongside classic-era members Slash and Duff McKagan.

===The Dead Daisies (2013–16)===

In 2013, Fortus joined the Dead Daisies with the likes of Jon Stevens and Dave Lowy as well as Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Frank Ferrer and Dizzy Reed. Their eponymous debut album was released on August 9, 2013. A second album, &quot;Revolucion,&quot; was released in 2015. Fortus left the Dead Daisies in 2016 to focus on Guns N&#x27; Roses.

===Other projects===
Fortus was in a group called Honky Toast with Frank Ferrer, singer Eric J. Toast, and bassist E.Z. Bake. The group released one album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Watcha Gonna Do Honky?&quot;.

Fortus has collaborated with techno-rock musician BT on several occasions, including touring with him in 2000.

In March 2008, Fortus was one of the guest guitarists for the reunion shows of X Japan at the Tokyo Dome. He played with them three more times in 2018: on April 10 and 11 at Zepp Divercity and on April 14 at Coachella.

In 2008, he joined the Danish rock/pop band the Storm on their tour. Fortus played guitar on their first record, &quot;Where the Storm Meets the Ground&quot;, and is a personal friend of lead singer Pernille Rosendahl and lead guitarist Johan Wohlert.

Fortus provided guitar for former The Replacements and Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Tommy Stinson&#x27;s two solo albums. Fortus also recorded a cover of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; for Guitar Hero World Tour and later played the song live as a solo spot during Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27;s 2012 tour.

He has collaborated with singer-songwriter Lásse Kvernmo in a project called Sáivu. Fortus has also recorded or toured with acts such as Rihanna, N*SYNC, Nena, and Ben Folds, among others.

Fortus is a member (alongside Ferrer) of New York–based band The Compulsions.

Fortus briefly joined Thin Lizzy as lead guitarist in 2011.

In September 2015, he was seriously injured in a motorcycle crash, causing him to miss dates with the Dead Daisies. Fortus suffered a broken shoulder blade, a broken collarbone, six broken ribs, a broken toe, a bruised lung, a lacerated liver, and a concussion.

On December 10, 2016, Fortus married Stephanie Howlett, a St. Louis–based attorney. The couple resides in St. Louis County, Missouri, with their two daughters.

<doc id="889679" wikidata="Q410779" url="?curid=889679" title="U.S. Route 92">
<text>U.S. Highway 92 (US 92) is a U.S. Route entirely in the state of Florida. The western terminus is at US 19 Alternate (US 19 Alt.) and State Road 687 (SR 687)) in downtown St. Petersburg. The eastern terminus is at SR A1A in Daytona Beach. Originally the main thouroughfare connecting the major cities of Central Florida, this has since been superseded by Interstate 4 (I-4), which runs nearly the same route. For nearly half of its length, US 92 runs concurrently with US 17.

Like all highways designated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in Florida, US 92 always carries a hidden state road number from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT):
*State Road 687 from the US route&#x27;s western terminus at US 19 Alt./SR 595 to the junction with SR 686/SR 687/SR 694 in St. Petersburg;
*State Road 600 from the junction with SR 686/SR 687/SR 694 in St. Petersburg to George Jenkins Boulevard in Lakeland, and again from East Gary Road in Lakeland to the route&#x27;s eastern terminus at SR A1A in Daytona Beach;
*State Road 517 (formerly SR 600B) from George Jenkins Boulevard (SR 600 east) to Memorial Boulevard (SR 546 west) in Lakeland; and
*State Road 546 from Memorial Boulevard to East Gary Road (SR 600 west) in Lakeland.

==Route description==
US 92 runs concurrently with SR 687 from downtown St. Petersburg to SR 600, SR 686 and SR 694 at the west end of the Gandy Causeway; unsigned SR 600 from the west end of the Gandy Causeway to west of downtown Lakeland; unsigned SR 517 west of downtown Lakeland; SR 546 from west of downtown Lakeland to east of downtown Lakeland; and unsigned SR 600 from east of downtown Lakeland to Daytona Beach.

===Tampa Bay Area===
US 92 begins its eastward journey along SR 687 at the intersection of SR 595 in St. Petersburg. The road continues north along SR 687 until it reaches the eastern termini of SR 686 and SR 694, where it turns right on Gandy Boulevard (SR 600) before crossing the Gandy Bridge into Tampa. After crossing the Gandy Bridge, US 92 intersects West Shore Boulevard and runs east along Gandy Boulevard until it reaches Dale Mabry Highway at the first interchange with the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway where it turns north. SR 685 branches to the northeast at Henderson Boulevard. The next major intersections are Kennedy Boulevard (SR 60), then I-275 at exit 41A. In between SR 616 and SR 574, US 92 passes George M. Steinbrenner Field and Raymond James Stadium. A parclo interchange with Hillsborough Avenue takes US 92 from Dale Mabry to Hillsborough Avenue and SR 580 from Hillsborough Avenue to Dale Mabry Highway. US 92 crosses two parallel bridges over the Hillsborough River, which consist of a 1939-built eastbound vertical lift bridge, and a 1960-built westbound bascule bridge. Later the road intersects with US 41 Business (US 41 Bus.), I-275 again at exit 47A-B, then intersects northbound US 41 and SR 45, where US 41 and US 92 overlap each other. One other major intersection exists with SR 585 before US 41 turns southbound as the concurrency ends. 

After SR 583, the road becomes part of the collective-distributor roads along I-4 west and east of the parclo interchange with US 301 at exit 7. The eastern end of the interchange contains a stub for a proposed west-to-northbound ramp to US 301 at the westbound flyover. Eventually, US 92 crosses under I-75 but does not intersect it directly (access to I-75 is only available eastbound from I-4). Three other local roads that cross US 92 access I-4. These consist of Mango Road in Mango, followed by McIntosh Road and Branch Forbes Road in Dover. Within Plant City US 92 approaches the southern terminus of SR 566 (Thonotosassa Road) then splits into a one-way pair. The first major intersection along this one-way pair is SR 39 (Alexander Road), followed by SR 574, but only along the eastbound lanes. In downtown Plant City, US 92 encounters SR 39A, with which it has a two-block overlap between Wheeler and Collins Streets. After the one-way pair ends, the last state highway to intersect the route in the city and Hillsborough County is the southern terminus of SR 533 (Park Road). East of SR 533, the road encounters a random series of level crossings for freight spurs leading from the CSX Lakeland Subdivision.

===Polk County vicinity===
As the road crosses the Hillsborough-Polk county line from Youmans, it passes a historic stone marker on the southwest corner of County Line Road. It also passes by a former truck weigh station, and then runs beneath SR 570 (Polk Parkway) with no direct access. After the intersection with SR 572, it passes by the Silver Moon Drive-In in the former unincorporated community of Winston. Entering the city of Lakeland, US 92 approaches the intersection with Wabash Avenue (hidden SR 517) and makes a brief turn to the north, while SR 600 continues eastbound unmarked along George Jenkins Boulevard (former US 92 Bus.). The route turns east again at the intersection with SR 546, and overlaps that route through the rest of the city. US 92/SR 546 continues eastbound along Memorial Boulevard where it climbs a bridge over the CSX Vitis Subdivision and SR 539 with no access. Roughly 16 blocks later, the two routes approach US 98, and is joined by hidden SR 700. Three blocks later, it intersects the southern terminus of SR 33. SR 700 leaves the route at North Lake Parker Avenue, while US 92/SR 546 rides along the southern bank of Lake Parker, until the intersection of East Gary Road, where SR 546 comes to an end and hidden SR 600 rejoins the route.

On the border between Crystal Lake and Combee Settlement, US 92/SR 600 encounters the intersection with SR 659. Later it enters more rural surroundings as it enters Fussels Corner and briefly runs directly along the north side of the CSX Carters Subdivision, then moves away from the tracks as it enters Auburndale, where the route encounters the Polk Parkway again, but this time at an interchange. Serving as a commercial strip beyond this point, the route encounters the southern terminus of County Road 655 (CR 655), and three blocks later the northern terminus of SR 655. The road curves northeast where it barely runs along the southeast coast of Lake Lena, then curves to the southeast at Bridgers Avenue, a former alignment of US 92. From there it runs along a bridge that passes over a railroad junction between the CSX Auburndale Subdivision, Carters Subdivision and a freight spur leading between the northeast coast of Lake Lena, and southwest coast of Lake Ariana. As the route descends from the bridge, the street name changes to Magnolia Avenue and five blocks later, encounters the intersection of SR 559 (Main Street). Across from the south side of Auburndale Cemetery the western terminus of SR 544 branches off to the southeast towards Legoland (formerly Cypress Gardens) and part of Haines City. In the meantime, US 92 curves back to the northeast where it briefly enters a northwestern portion of Winter Haven, encounters the eastern end of Bridgers Avenue, and serves as the location for Winter Haven Regional Airport (a.k.a. Gilbert&#x27;s Field).
US 92 and US 17 join at the southern end of Lake Alfred. SR 600 continues to carry US 92 from Auburndale, while SR 555 takes US 17 from the south via Winter Haven. CR 555 soon splits to the north along the old road through Lake Alfred, while US 17/US 92 runs to the northeast on Lake Shore Way. The routes become a one-way pair between Echo Street and Seminole Way, but before that pair ends, CR 557 begins at Polemo Street, where it heads west for a block to CR 555, and then turns north towards I-4; just past CR 557, US 17/US 92 turns east towards Haines City. It enters downtown Haines City on Hinson Avenue after crossing under US 27 at a cloverleaf, meeting the northern end of SR 17 (formerly US 27 Alt.) before turning north on 17th Street. It soon meets CR 580, which runs east to Poinciana. In Davenport, US 92 meets CR 547, which heads west to US 27 and north along old US 17/US 92. US 92 then intersects with Ronald Reagan Parkway (CR 54) at Loughman.

===Orlando area===

Entering Osceola County, US 92 picks up the Orange Blossom Trail name. Orange Blossom Trail (OBT) takes US 92 east and north through Kissimmee and into Orlando. The OBT name temporarily ends at Pleasant Hill Road (former SR 531) in southern Kissimmee, where US 92 uses John Young Parkway (formerly Bermuda Avenue) to Vine Street (US 192/SR 530). It turns east there on US 192, turning north at Main Street, which becomes OBT at the north city limits. US 441 (along with SR 500) joins US 92 at US 192—thus OBT carries US 17, US 92 and US 441, as well as unsigned SR 500 and SR 600, from Kissimmee to Orlando. Along this stretch, the road intersects the Osceola Parkway in Kissimmee, SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay) at exit 11, and the Central Florida Parkway as it passes east of the resort area of Orlando that includes Walt Disney World and affiliated resorts, Sea World, and Universal Studios. OBT then comes to a massive combined interchange with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and SR 528 (Beachline Expressway) in Sky Lake. North of this interchange, the road passes west of The Florida Mall and intersects SR 482.

The road reaches an interchange with I-4 in Holden Heights. OBT continues into Orlando and comes to a diamond interchange with SR 408 (East–West Expressway) at exit 9. Orange Blossom Trail bypasses downtown Orlando to the west, meeting SR 50 (Colonial Drive) northwest of downtown. At SR 50, US 17/US 92 turns east, while US 441 continues northwest on OBT towards Apopka. US 17, concurrent with SR 50 (and SR 600), meets the south end of Edgewater Drive and crosses I-4 and SR 527 (Orange Avenue and Magnolia Avenue) before meeting Mills Avenue (SR 15), where US 17/US 92 turns north.

Mills Avenue carries SR 15 on both sides of SR 50, but is only signed as such to the south, as north of SR 50, it carries US 92 (and unsigned SR 600). It crosses Lake Estelle on the Andrews Causeway before reaching the border between Orlando and Winter Park.

In Winter Park, US 92&#x27;s name changes to Orlando Avenue. It crosses SR 527 (Orange Avenue) and SR 426 (Fairbanks Avenue) and meets the east end of SR 423 (Lee Road) while bypassing downtown Winter Park to the west. Shortly after crossing into Maitland, it passes under the SunRail tracks (formerly CSX Transportation&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; Line), and the old road through downtown Winter Park — Park Avenue — merges in from the southeast. US 92 meets the east end of CR 438A (Lake Avenue), which heads west to Eatonville, and then splits from the old alignment (CR 427) near downtown Maitland. It crosses Horatio Avenue (former County Road 436A) and meets the east end of SR 414 (Maitland Boulevard) before crossing into Seminole County.

In Seminole County, US 92 is a main commercial strip as it heads through Casselberry (where it crosses SR 436 [Semoran Boulevard] at an interchange) and Longwood (where it crosses SR 434). North of Longwood it meets the north end of SR 419 and crosses CR 427 (the old alignment). Lake Mary Boulevard, Airport Boulevard and SR 417 cross US 92 in southern Sanford, and it meets the west end of CR 427A. At 25th Street, southwest of downtown Sanford, SR 46 comes in from the east and turns north to run concurrently near downtown; CR 46A heads west on 25th Street. 13th Street marks the west end of CR 415, and at 1st Street the triple concurrency turns west. Before leaving the Sanford city limits, the routes run over a bridge for a railroad line near the Sanford Amtrak Auto Train station, as well as the nearby SunRail station. The routes leave the concurrency with SR 46 at the north end of CR 15 (once a branch of SR 15), and then runs north towards the interchange with I-4 where US 17/US 92 turns west along the south shore of Lake Monroe (part of the St. Johns River). Just before crossing the river into Volusia County at the west end of the lake, which runs unsigned with SR 15 and SR 600 here) and crosses under at the end of its own bridge across the river (the St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge).

===DeBary to Daytona Beach===
After crossing the St. Johns River via the C.A. &quot;Bill&quot; Benedict Bridge, US 92 continues north into Volusia County, meeting the west ends of CR 4162 (in DeBary), CR 4146, and CR 4145 (in Orange City). North of Orange City is a trumpet interchange with SR 472, a four-lane connection to I-4. US 92 then crosses CR 4116 and meets the south end of SR 15A, a western bypass of DeLand. US 92 passes through downtown DeLand on Woodland Boulevard, crossing SR 44 at New York Avenue. The intersection of US 92 and SR 44 does not allow any turns—right or left—and so adjacent city streets are marked for those turns. In northern DeLand, US 92 splits to the east on International Speedway Boulevard, while US 17 continues north. To the west of the split, International Speedway Boulevard is CR 92, a short connection to SR 15A that allows traffic on US 92 to bypass downtown DeLand. SR 15A itself rejoins US 17 north of DeLand.

From DeLand to its terminus in Daytona Beach, US 92 carries the local name, International Speedway Boulevard, running through Tiger Bay State Forest then passing a connecting road towards I-4 with a westbound only flyover off-ramp and an eastbound only on-ramp from exit 129. The highway serves as the southern terminus of LPGA Boulevard then has an interchange with I-95 before it passes by the Daytona International Speedway. US 92 passes by other landmarks such as Daytona Beach International Airport and Volusia Mall. US 92 spans the Halifax River and Intracoastal Waterway via the Broadway Bridge before reaching its eastern terminus at SR A1A.

==History==
US 92 was in the original 1926 plan, connecting Tampa (concurrent with US 41) to US 1 in Daytona Beach. It had been the Dixie Highway Tampa-St. Petersburg Loop from Plant City to Haines City, the West Mainline from Haines City to Orlando, and the East Florida Connector from Orlando to DeLand.

US 92 was signed along the following roads in 1927:
* SR 17 from Tampa to Haines City;
* SR 2 from Haines City to Orlando;
* SR 3 from Orlando to DeLand; and
* SR 21 from DeLand to Daytona Beach.

When the bypass of downtown Tampa on SR 17 (Hillsborough Avenue) opened in the early 1930s, US 92 and US 41 were rerouted to use it. US 92 turned south from the new road where US 41 turned north, at Nebraska Avenue (former SR 5, probably then a spur of SR 5), and continued to end in downtown Tampa.

A 1942 map shows US 92 extended west along SR 17 and SR 229 to end at US 19 in Dunedin; it was soon truncated back to Tampa.

In the 1945 renumbering, the whole route of US 92 was numbered SR 600, except for the section south to downtown Tampa, which was SR 45. It was extended west and south to downtown St. Petersburg along SR 600 and SR 687 in 1953.

In 1947, the route was extended east in Daytona Beach across the Intracoastal Waterway and the Halifax River after the Broadway Bridge was reconstructed and opened.

In 1961, US 92 was moved to bypass downtown Lakeland, along SR 517 and SR 546. The old route was signed as US 92 Bus. until 1998.

Until 1999, US 92 ran through downtown Kissimmee on Emmett Street, Broadway and Main Street, along with US 17.

In 2006, US 92 (along with US 17) was re-signed to bypass downtown Kissimmee, moving it to US 192 from John Young Parkway to US 441.

In late 2013, FDOT began an $80 million project to construct a flyover interchange with US 17/US 92 traveling over SR 436 in Casselberry. This interchange was built to alleviate congestion at one of the busiest intersections in Florida. The flyover interchange was completed on April 6, 2015, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held.

==Major intersections==
























==Special routes==
===Kissimmee truck route===
US Highway 17/US Highway 92 Truck (US 17/US 92 Truck) is an alternate route for US 17/US 92 in northern Kissimmee, following John Young Parkway and the Osceola Parkway (CR 522) instead of Vine Street (US 192) and Orange Blossom Trail. It was signed in about 2011 when the single-point urban interchange at John Young and Osceola Parkways was completed.

===Maitland truck route===
US Highway 17/US Highway 92 Truck (US 17/US 92 Truck) is designated to divert overheight truck traffic away from a low railroad bridge that carries the SunRail rail line over US 17-92 in southern Maitland.

===Lakeland business route===

U.S. Route 92 Business (US 92 Bus.) in Lakeland was a business route designed to keep trucks from entering Downtown Lakeland that followed SR 600 between 1961 and 1998. The route began where US 92 turned north onto SR 517. It runs along George Jenkins Boulevard, then makes a sharp southeast turn along Sloan Avenue, while George Jenkins Boulevard becomes SR 548. Sloan Avenue becomes a divided highway between the bridge beneath the CSX Lakeland Subdivision, only to emerge at the intersection of West Main Street where it turns east. The road&#x27;s major intersections include a partial interchange with SR 563, and then SR 37, where West Main Street becomes East Main Street. The road makes a brief left turn onto Massachusetts Avenue in front of Lake Mirror for one block, then turns right at the end of Cedar Street where it runs along the north shore of Lake Mirror passing by Lakeland Amtrak Station. East Main makes a sharp right turn to the south before the intersection of Rose Street, then turns east again at the intersection of East Lake Street. From there it has an intersection with US 98 (SR 548), and after Lake Parker Avenue makes a north turn onto Tyler Road. The road crosses under the CSX Carters Subdivision, this time beneath a two-lane undivided bridge, and then curves onto East Gary Road, where it runs east until finally ending at US 92 along the south shore of Lake Parker. FDOT maps still show US 92 Bus. as an existing route.

<text>Thomas Eugene Stinson (born October 6, 1966) is an American rock musician. He came to prominence in the 1980s as the bass guitarist for The Replacements, one of the definitive American alternative rock groups. After their breakup in 1991, Stinson formed Bash &amp; Pop, acting as lead vocalist, guitarist and frontman. In the mid-1990s he was the singer and guitarist for the rock band Perfect, and eventually joined the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1998.

Stinson released his debut solo album, &quot;Village Gorilla Head&quot; in 2004 and subsequently joined Soul Asylum for the completion of their album &quot;The Silver Lining&quot;, and was a member of the band for the album&#x27;s tour in 2006 before joining them as a permanent member until 2011. He released his second solo album, critically acclaimed &quot;One Man Mutiny&quot;, on his own Done To Death Music label in 2011.

Stinson left Guns N&#x27; Roses after touring in 2014 and was replaced by the band&#x27;s original bassist Duff McKagan. In 2016 he reunited Bash &amp; Pop, and released a new album in 2017, titled &quot;Anything Could Happen&quot;.

== Career ==
===The Replacements (1979–1991, 2012–2015)===

After beginning to learn the bass at the age of 11, Stinson began playing and covering songs with his half-brother, Bob Stinson, and drummer Chris Mars under the name &quot;Dogbreath&quot; without a singer. After recruiting singer Paul Westerberg, Dogbreath changed their name to The Impediments and played a drunken performance, without Stinson, at a church hall gig in June 1980. After being banned from the venue for disorderly behavior, they changed their name to The Replacements.

After signing to Twin/Tone Records, by label owner Peter Jesperson who also became the group&#x27;s manager, they released their debut album, &quot;Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash&quot;, in 1981 with an EP, &quot;Stink&quot;, following in 1982. The Replacements began to distance themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of &quot;Stink&quot; and, inspired by other rock subgenres, released their second album, &quot;Hootenanny&quot;, in April 1983. &quot;Hootenanny&quot; was played on over two hundred radio stations across the country, with critics acclaiming the album; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Robert Christgau deemed it &quot;the most critically independent album of 1983&quot;. The band embarked on their first tour of the U.S. in April 1983, during this time Stinson dropped out of tenth grade to join the rest of the band on tour. The band toured cities such as Detroit, Cleveland and Philadelphia, but their intended destination was New York City, where they played at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City and Maxwell&#x27;s.

For the recording of their next studio album, The Replacements decided to return to Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983 with the result being &quot;Let It Be&quot;, released in October 1984. A live album, &quot;The Shit Hits the Fans&quot;, was released in 1985.

Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Sire Records, eventually signed The Replacements with their first major-label release being the &quot;Tim&quot; album, produced by Tommy Erdelyi, released in 1985. After the release of &quot;Tim&quot;, The Replacements fired Tommy&#x27;s brother, Bob Stinson, as well as Jesperson the same year. The remaining Replacements carried on as a trio for &quot;Pleased to Meet Me&quot;, released in 1987, recorded in Memphis with producer Jim Dickinson. Guitarist Slim Dunlap took over lead guitar duties for the subsequent tour and soon became a full member of the band.

They released &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot;, in 1989, which featured the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be You&quot;, which topped Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock chart. Following a disastrous tour opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Westerberg recorded a new album largely with session musicians but was persuaded to release it as a Replacements album. &quot;All Shook Down&quot;, released in 1990, won critical praise and more mainstream attention, though the many guest players and Mars&#x27;s quick departure from the band following the album&#x27;s release led many to wonder about the band&#x27;s future.Drummer Steve Foley was recruited as Mars&#x27;s replacement in 1990, and the band embarked on a long farewell tour which lasted into the summer of 1991. On July 4, 1991, the band officially broke up following a Taste of Chicago performance in Grant Park, referred to by fans as &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over &#x27;Til the Fat Roadie Plays&quot; because each member disappeared during the set, their respective roadies taking their places. This show was broadcast by Chicago radio station WXRT.

In December 2005, he reunited with his surviving Replacements band mates Paul Westerberg and original drummer Chris Mars to record two new songs for a greatest-hits collection. Stinson further collaborated with Westerberg on the soundtrack to the Sony feature film &quot;Open Season&quot;, recording bass tracks for &#x27;Love You in the Fall&#x27; and &#x27;Right to Arm Bears&#x27;.

On September 20, 2012, Stinson and Westerberg recorded &quot;Busted Up&quot; as part of the &quot;Songs For Slim&quot; vinyl series. The project was created to raise money for guitarist Slim Dunlap after he suffered a massive stroke in February 2012. They recorded three additional songs, released as the &quot;Songs For Slim EP&quot;, the band&#x27;s first release of all newly recorded music since &quot;All Shook Down&quot;. A subsequent eBay auction of a special edition 10&quot; version of the EP, limited to 250, raised over $106,000 for Slim&#x27;s care.

The band reunited in 2013 to play their first live show in 22 years at Riot Fest in Chicago. Former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Josh Freese joined Stinson as part of The Replacements for the tour. After a tour that lasted through 2015, the Replacements broke up again, with Stinson stating that any material written would be reworked for his solo career.

===Bash and Pop (1992–1994)===

With a name selected from a contest hosted by New York radio station WDRE, Stinson, on guitar and lead vocals, formed his first post-Replacements group Bash &amp; Pop in 1992 with drummer Steve Foley being added to the group, also formerly of The Replacements, along with his brother Kevin on bass and guitarist Steve Brantseg. Rumors were that Bash &amp; Pop were a band in name only with Stinson recording the album, &quot;Friday Night Is Killing Me&quot;, mostly by himself along with a number of guest musicians. Steve, Kevin and Brantseg all contributed to the album, &quot;Friday Night Is Killing Me&quot;, along with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers members Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell, Wire Train&#x27;s Jeff Trott as well as other musicians Greg Leisz, Brian McCloud, Phil Jones and Tommy Steel, with the album being released in January 1993, through Sire/Reprise Records, to mainly mixed reviews.

A tour in support followed along with the recording of the track &quot;Making Me Sick&quot; which was included on the soundtrack, released in 1994, to the movie &quot;Clerks&quot; however the group disbanded later in 1994.

===Perfect (1995–1998)===

Following the breakup of previous group Bash &amp; Pop, Stinson formed Perfect along with the group&#x27;s guitarist Marc Solomon, bassist Robert Cooper as well as drummer Gersh. After playing a number of shows, they were soon signed to Medium Cool Records by label head Peter Jesperson, who was also an old manager of The Replacements, where they began recording for a debut EP.

The &quot;When Squirrels Play Chicken EP&quot;, produced by Don Smith, was released in 1996 to positive reviews with Greg Prato, of Allmusic, stating &quot;fans will undoubtedly be more pleased with his new band, Perfect, which is much more focused, and in the expected drunken-Johnny Thunders guitar-rock style.&quot;

In 1997 the group entered the studio with producer Jim Dickinson to produce their debut album, tentatively titled &quot;Seven Days a Week&quot;. Stinson had now switched back to bass for the departed Cooper, and added Dave Philips on guitar. Despite completing the album, it was shelved by Regency Pictures, who had acquired Medium Cool distributors Restless Records, which led to the group&#x27;s eventual breakup in 1998. The album itself was leaked onto the internet through advance copies sent to record labels, however a remixed and resequenced version of &quot;Seven Days a Week&quot;, retitled &quot;Once, Twice, Three Times a Maybe&quot;, was released by Rykodisc in 2004. which was, much like the EP, well received.

===Guns N&#x27; Roses (1998–2014)===

In 1998, Stinson joined Guns N&#x27; Roses to replace Duff McKagan who quit due to creative differences and a desire to spend more time with his family. Stinson was recommended to the group by his friend Josh Freese, who was the band&#x27;s drummer at the time. Stinson said he came to admire McKagan&#x27;s musicianship but also added &quot;Guns N&#x27; Roses were never my thing&quot; during their early 1990s ascendency to stardom, and he auditioned mainly to have a chance to play with Freese. Guitarist Richard Fortus described Stinson&#x27;s role as the band leader and &quot;ultimate musical director&quot; during rehearsals and recordings when vocalist Axl Rose was away. 

Stinson&#x27;s bass playing is featured prominently on the track &quot;Oh My God&quot;, featured on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;End of Days&quot;, as well as their long-delayed &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; album which was eventually released in 2008. Stinson played bass on 13 of 14 songs, was credited for arrangements on &quot;Riad N&#x27; the Bedouins&quot;, performed backing vocals on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, &quot;Better&quot;, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, &quot;There Was a Time&quot;, &amp; &quot;Riad N&#x27; the Bedouins&quot;. He co-wrote &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, &quot;There Was a Time&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and &quot;Riad N&#x27; the Bedouins&quot;. Stinson is also credited as co-writer on the 2021 Guns N&#x27; Roses track &quot;Hard Skool&quot;, initially written during the &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; sessions.
On November 24, 2006, at Cleveland&#x27;s Quicken Loans Arena, Axl Rose called the Eagles of Death Metal (one of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; opening acts) the &quot;Pigeons of Shit Metal.&quot; Jesse Hughes, the Eagles of Death Metal&#x27;s lead singer, told &quot;NME&quot; that Stinson took his bass off and threw it on the floor saying &quot;Fuck you, that&#x27;s it&quot; and threatened to leave the band. Stinson did not leave Guns N&#x27; Roses; however, the Eagles of Death Metal were fired from the tour. On December 2, 2006, Stinson issued a statement reading, in part: &quot;Eagles of Death Metal were a suggestion of mine a while ago. Turns out they were the wrong band for our crowd. They were booed and did not play for as long as they were scheduled to. ... In the past I have thrown my bass. I have never thrown it at Axl or anyone else in the band nor has anyone thrown my bass back at me... yet. Axl has been a dear friend to me for nine years. We have no problem communicating and wish that people would stay the fuck out of shit they don&#x27;t know anything about.&quot;

During the Chinese Democracy World Tour, Stinson played several punk songs during his solo spot, such as &quot;Sonic Reducer&quot; by The Dead Boys, and &quot;My Generation&quot; by The Who, as well as &quot;Motivation&quot; from his first album, &quot;Village Gorilla Head&quot;. Stinson&#x27;s performance of &quot;Motivation&quot; is featured on the live album, &quot;Appetite for Democracy 3D&quot;.

Stinson left the group after 2014 tour, and commented on his departure, stating &quot;I left it in a good way. I actually had to just start turning down tours because I was unable to tour; I got into a position, personally, where my personal life was going to prevent me from doing, I don’t know — it must have been about five tours that they called me to do, and I just said I can’t do ’em.&quot; Stinson was replaced by the returning McKagan.

===Solo career (2004–2005)===

Stinson began writing what would become &quot;Village Gorilla Head&quot; in the late 90s, and after Frank Black, of the Pixies, gave Stinson the use of his mobile recording studio and his studio space for free he began recording in 2003 with Philip Broussard who co-produced the album.

Stinson played most of the instruments on the album, with the exception of drums, but featured contributions by Guns N&#x27; Roses band mates Richard Fortus and Dizzy Reed, who contributed guitars and keyboards respectively, along with drummers Gersh, who played with Stinson in Perfect, and Josh Freese, who was also previously a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, as well as Josh&#x27;s brother Jason, who provided saxophone, and Dave Philips, also of Perfect, providing guitar and pedal steel. The album was released on July 27, 2004 to positive reviews from music critics.

For the tour supporting the album, Stinson enlisted Alien Crime Syndicate to be his support act during the tour as well as his backing band during the shows, as well as The Figgs on another leg.

===Soul Asylum (2005–2012)===

In late 2005, Stinson joined Soul Asylum for a few gigs in tribute to recently deceased bassist and founding member Karl Mueller. Stinson and Dave Pirner (founding member of Soul Asylum) were friends in high school in Minneapolis, MN. He also helped finish the rest of the recording for the album &quot;The Silver Lining&quot; released in 2006. He toured with them for a number of years when his schedule allowed for it, played on their 2012 Delayed Reaction album and was replaced permanently by Winston Roye in 2012 due to his lack of availability.

===Return to solo career (2011–2014)===

In early 2011, Stinson announced his second solo album, &quot;One Man Mutiny&quot;, was to be released on August 30, 2011. Described as his most fully realized work in both production quality and craftsmanship of song, Stinson released the album on his own Done To Death Music label and played sporadic dates across the country with Pete Donnelly and Mike Gent from The Figgs, Tim Schweiger, Justin Perkins and Jon Phillip from Limbeck.

In May 2011, Stinson played three well-attended shows in the Midwest – Club Garibaldi&#x27;s in Milwaukee, First Avenue in Minneapolis and Double Door in Chicago. At First Avenue, he was surprised onstage by Dave Pirner from Soul Asylum for the encore. Pirner smashed several cheap guitars on stage before Stinson and the band played a cover of The Undertones&#x27; &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; to close out the night.

Stinson and the band played eight gigs over four days at the 2012 SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Tecas, including a Daytrotter Session and a memorable set at Alejandro Escovedo&#x27;s famous Closing Party at the Continental Club.

In late 2012, Stinson and Fred Armisen joined Dinosaur Jr. on stage at their &quot;You&#x27;re Living All Over Me&quot; 25th anniversary show at Terminal 5 in NYC to play &quot;TV Eye&quot; by The Stooges during the encore.

In 2013, Stinson recorded two songs with The Old 97&#x27;s, appearing on their 2014 album &quot;Most Messed Up&quot;. He shared lead guitar duties with Ken Bethea and contributed vocals on &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;Most Messed Up.&quot;

===Bash &amp; Pop reunion (2016–present)===
In 2016, after working on material for a new solo album, Stinson decided to release it under the Bash &amp; Pop moniker, reuniting the band. An album, &quot;Anything Could Happen&quot; was released on January 20, 2017. Some of the material was also written by Stinson to be included on a possible new Replacements album that never came to fruition.

In 2016 and 2017 Bash &amp; Pop toured North America and Europe in support of the new album.

In 2021, Stinson began a tour of intimate backyard performances fronting Cowboys in the Campfire, his duo with Pennsylvania-based guitarist Chip Roberts.

==Gear==

During his early years with The Replacements, Stinson most notably used a Rickenbacker 4001 bass. In the late 1980s, he gravitated toward the Fender Precision Bass, which would later serve as the foundation for his own signature model with ESP. For guitars, he has used a variety of Fender Telecaster models and Gibson acoustics.

On stage with Guns N&#x27; Roses, Stinson used a lineup of ESP Vintage-4 basses (with the P/J pickup configuration) in different colors, all of which were equipped with EMG PJ-Set pickups. An exception to this was the songs &quot;Better&quot;, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; and &quot;Sorry&quot;, during which he used a James Trussart Steelcaster bass. For live amplification he used two Ampeg Heritage B-15 reissues that are situated at the rear of the stage facing away, only one of them being mic&#x27;d. In the studio, it is unclear what basses he has used for individual tracks, but he has acknowledged using a Gibson Thunderbird Bass on the title track of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. As of 2011 Stinson is endorsing ESP guitar co. Notably using the ESP Vintage-4 with EMG PJ-Set pickups.

Stinson has stated that all his basses have EMG pickups, saying that &quot;they give [him] a lot of growl and grit when they hit the preamp of an SVT.&quot; During recording, Stinson has used SWR amps, a Matchless combo and DI. Early live shows during his tenure with Guns N&#x27; Roses featured the SWR amps, but Stinson soon realized that it wasn&#x27;t suitable for their situation (apparently, it was deemed too loud to be used at full capacity). Since then, he has been using the Ampeg Heritage B-15 Reissue 1x15 combo with a few Ampeg 8x10 cabinets for low-end.

EMG lists Stinson as a user of their PJ Set Pickups on their website.

At the NAMM Show in 2013, ESP introduced their new Tommy Stinson Signature Series basses. Stinson was on-hand for the festivities.

<text>Robert John &quot;Robin&quot; Finck (born November 7, 1971) is an American guitarist. Finck is the longest-serving touring musician for Nine Inch Nails, performing with the band from 1994 to 2000, and returning in 2008. With Nine Inch Nails, Finck contributed studio performances on &quot;The Slip&quot; (2008).

Finck also was an official member of Guns N&#x27; Roses from 1997 through 2008. With Guns N’ Roses, Finck wrote and recorded on the long-delayed &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; (2008), notably co-writing the song &quot;Better&quot;.

In 2020, Finck was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Nine Inch Nails. (Guns N&#x27; Roses were inducted in 2012; however, Finck was not inducted.)

==Career==
Finck grew up in Marietta, Georgia and played with several unsigned bands based primarily in the Atlanta area, including acts such as Prowess, Bat Your Lashes, Sik Dik (bandmates of which included Steve &quot;Holiday&quot; Childress and Michael Allen, currently of The Goodies and Greg Thum), and The Hookers.

He joined Nine Inch Nails as part of their touring band in 1994–95 for their &quot;Self-Destruct&quot; and &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot; tours following the departure of previous guitarist Richard Patrick. Finck appeared with Nine Inch Nails at Woodstock &#x27;94, and saw his first official release with them, the &quot;Closer to God&quot; single, released in 1994. Once the tour was completed, he took a job playing for the circus troupe Cirque du Soleil in the original tour of Quidam. In 1997 Finck signed a two-year contract with Guns N&#x27; Roses as the replacement for Slash (who had quit the band at the end of the previous year) and began work on what was ultimately to become the band&#x27;s long delayed album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. When the two years were up the album had not been completed, although the song &quot;Oh My God&quot; was released on the &quot;End of Days&quot; soundtrack. Whether or not Finck played on the song is in dispute; GNR vocalist Axl Rose says he did while Finck himself says he did not.

Finck rejoined Nine Inch Nails as the band embarked on their &quot;Fragility v1.0&quot; and &quot;Fragility v2.0&quot; tours in support of the 1999 album &quot;The Fragile&quot;. These tours were recorded and released as the live album/DVD, &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot;. He also played on a studio-recorded version of &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; on the companion album &quot;Still&quot;, which was included with the deluxe version of &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; and later made available as a standalone CD through nin.com. Shortly after the tour ended in 2000 he returned to Guns N&#x27; Roses, playing four shows with them in late 2001 followed by a brief tour of Europe and Asia in mid-2002 and a live appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards. A planned US tour was meant to continue through the remainder of 2002 but was called off by the promoter after two cancelled shows led to rioting by fans. Around this time Finck and then-bandmate Buckethead contributed to the soundtrack of the John Carpenter movie &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot;, playing alongside members of thrash metal group Anthrax and guitar virtuoso Steve Vai. After his touring obligations with GNR were fulfilled he joined the LedZAerial production (a performance by acrobats set to the music of the band Led Zeppelin).

Finck was invited to rejoin NIN to tour in support of their 2005 album &quot;With Teeth&quot; but chose not to and the position was filled by Aaron North. In the summer of 2006, he toured Europe with Guns N&#x27; Roses playing in front of over 700,000 people. They finished up by touring North America for the remainder of the year, and went to Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 2007.

On April 4, 2008, it was announced via nin.com that Finck would be rejoining Nine Inch Nails as a member of the live band. He subsequently contributed to the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;The Slip&quot;, earning a performance credit alongside then-band members Josh Freese and Alessandro Cortini.

In November 2008 Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; long-awaited album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was released. Finck has a co-writing credit on the song &quot;Better&quot;, which was later released as a single, as well as 7 other songs on the album. He also played guitar on every track, performed 7 of the guitar solos and has additional credits for keyboards, arrangements and pre-production. He chose to remain with NIN after the album&#x27;s release and, on March 21, 2009, was officially replaced as the lead guitarist of Guns N&#x27; Roses by guitarist DJ Ashba. The official Guns N&#x27; Roses website stated that &quot;Robin continues to be part of GN&#x27;R, by virtue of Guns&#x27; history and his involvement in Chinese Democracy&quot;.

Following the departure of NIN live band members Alessandro Cortini and Josh Freese at the end of 2008 Finck and bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen re-grouped with band leader Trent Reznor and new drummer Ilan Rubin and the 4-piece band completed an 8-date tour of Australia and New Zealand between February and March 2009. Finck continued to perform with the band throughout the 2009 Nine Inch Nails/Janes Addiction (NIN|JA) tour, with shows throughout North America, and the subsequent Wave Goodbye tour through Europe and Asia. The band then returned to the US to play a series of shows.
In October 2009 Finck and former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Axl Rose, Tommy Stinson and Buckethead were named in a lawsuit by electronic musician Ulrich Schnauss&#x27;s record labels Independiente and Domino alleging that they had committed copyright infringement by using portions of his compositions in the song &quot;Riad &#x27;n the Bedouins&quot;. Finck appears on the 2010 album &quot;The Lady Killer&quot; by artist CeeLo Green, performing guitar on the track &quot;The Lady Killer Theme (Outro)&quot;.

On March 12, 2012, Finck appeared on-stage with Guns N&#x27; Roses, performing &quot;Better&quot;, a song he co-wrote with Axl Rose.

On May 17, 2013, it was announced by Trent Reznor via his Twitter account and the nin.com home page, that Finck would be rejoining Nine Inch Nails for the 2013–14 tours. Finck has since performed with the group on each subsequent tour, although he only remains a touring member.

==Personal life==
Since 2001, Finck has been married to acrobat Bianca Sapetto, by whom he has two children. They met while working in Cirque du Soleil. Besides being a musician he also creates artwork and displays some of his own drawings and photos on his website. In 2007 he contributed artwork in the form of ink drawings to the album &quot;Frames&quot; by Oceansize at the request of their guitarist Gambler. In 2003, Finck was credited as one of the writers of a production called &quot;My Birthday Party&quot;, which incorporated acrobatics, storytelling, music, acting, and clowning. The show included actor Viggo Mortensen and was performed at the Miles Memorial Playhouse in Santa Monica, California.

On February 23, 2009 session drummer Josh Freese, who has been a bandmate of Finck&#x27;s in both Guns N&#x27; Roses and Nine Inch Nails, announced that as part of the pricing strategy for his new solo album &quot;Since 1972&quot; a one-off package costing $75,000 would include &quot;a flying trapeze lesson with Josh and Robin from NIN&quot; followed by a visit to Robin&#x27;s place afterwards where &quot;his wife will make you raw lasagna&quot;.

Finck is known for his theatrical appearance when performing, making use of makeup, costumes and clothing to enhance his stage presence. He has also been known to break out into eccentric dance moves during songs with various facial expressions. Between tours and appearances he frequently makes radical alterations to his image, and is particularly famous among fans for his many distinctive and often unusual hair styles. Axl Rose has described him as leading &quot;one of the most different lives I know of starting with the trapeze in his backyard to the TV in his closet.&quot;

==Equipment==
Finck is closely associated with Gibson Les Paul guitars and uses different versions of the guitar that are built from a variety of woods and equipped with numerous pickup combinations (in 2006 he was photographed at the New York City Gibson Guitar showroom collecting a Custom Les Paul Standard &#x27;58 Reissue for use on tour with Guns N&#x27; Roses). Many of them have been customized and he often moves the pickup selector switch from the top of the guitar&#x27;s body, as he has said the standard configuration is obstructive. After re-joining Nine Inch Nails in 2008 he began using several other guitars on stage, including Jerry Jones baritone guitars (similar in shape to Danelectro guitars), Fender Jazzmasters, Fender Telecasters and Gibson ES-355s. In 2020, Finck and Reverend Guitars unveiled a signature guitar for Finck based on Reverend&#x27;s Sensei using Railhammer Chisel pickups. Finck removed the tone knob as he only uses the volume and bass contour knobs.

In 2009 Finck signed with Schecter Guitar Research as an official endorsee and started using a number of Schecter guitars while touring with NIN, including custom versions of the PT Fastback and Ultra III. He also ordered a custom &quot;Tempest Classic&quot; guitar with gold top finish, an in-built compressor and a wah effect in place of the two tone controls. In late 2009 Schecter issued a press release which announced a limited edition Robin Finck signature guitar based on the Ultra Cure and Ultra III models was entering production. Finck is also listed as a user of Godin guitars on the company&#x27;s official website and can be seen playing Godin guitars on the Nine Inch Nails live DVD &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot;.

He uses a broad range of guitar amps (various models by Marshall Amplification and Mesa Boogie) and effects (including the BOSS DD-5 Digital Delay, Dunlop wah-wah, Devi Ever bit, the legend of fuzz, and RockTron Vodoo Valve) and is known to work very hard to re-create studio tones and textures when playing on stage. He frequently shoves the body of his guitar up against the speakers of his amplifiers during live performances to generate feedback and increased distortion. For some NIN songs he has been known to use an e-bow, as seen during the clip for &quot;La Mer&quot; on the &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; live DVD.

While his primary role in Guns N&#x27; Roses was that of lead guitarist, Finck is credited with playing some of the electronic keyboard parts on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. Similarly, although he performs with Nine Inch Nails mainly as a guitarist he often plays other instruments on stage, including lap steel guitar (with effects pedals mounted to the body of the instrument), ukulele, mandolin and keyboards/synthesizers. He also contributes backing vocals.

<text>Buprestidae is a family of beetles known as jewel beetles or metallic wood-boring beetles because of their glossy iridescent colors. Larvae of this family are known as flatheaded borers. The family is among the largest of the beetles, with some 15,500 species known in 775 genera. In addition, almost 100 fossil species have been described.

The larger and more spectacularly colored jewel beetles are highly prized by insect collectors. The elytra of some Buprestidae species have been traditionally used in beetlewing jewellery and decoration in certain countries in Asia, like India, Thailand and Japan.

==Description and ecology==
Shape is generally cylindrical or elongate to ovoid, with lengths ranging from , although most species are under . &quot;Catoxantha&quot;, &quot;Chrysaspis&quot;, &quot;Euchroma&quot; and &quot;Megaloxantha&quot; contain the largest species. A variety of bright colors are known, often in complicated patterns. The iridescence common to these beetles is not due to pigments in the exoskeleton, but instead is caused by structural coloration, in which microscopic texture in their cuticle selectively reflects specific frequencies of light in particular directions. This is the same effect that makes a compact disc reflect multiple colors.

The larvae bore through roots, logs, stems, and leaves of various types of plants, ranging from trees to grasses. The wood boring types generally favor dying or dead branches on otherwise-healthy trees, while a few types attack green wood; some of these are serious pests capable of killing trees and causing major economic damage, such as the invasive emerald ash borer. Some species are attracted to recently burned forests to lay their eggs. They can sense pine wood smoke from up to 50 miles away, and can see infrared light, helping them to zero in as they get closer to a forest fire.

Ten species of flatheaded borers of the family Buprestidae feed on spruce and fir, but hemlock is their preferred food source (Rose and Lindquist 1985). As with roundheaded borers, most feeding occurs in dying or dead trees, or close to injuries on living trees. Damage becomes abundant only where a continuing supply of breeding material is available. The life history of these borers is similar to that of the roundheaded borers, but some exceedingly long life cycles have been reported under adverse conditions. Full-grown larvae, up to 25 mm long, are characteristically flattened, the anterior part of the body being much broader than the rest. The bronzed adults are usually seen only where suitable material occurs in sunny locations.

==Systematics==
Jewel beetle classification is not yet robustly established, although there appear to be five or six main lineages, which may be considered subfamilies, possibly with one or two being raised to families in their own right. Some other systems define up to 14 subfamilies.

The earliest unambiguous members of the family are known from the Middle Jurassic, around 160 million years ago, earlier claimed records from the Triassic based on isolated elytra are not definitive.

<text>U.S. Route 98 (US 98) is an east–west United States Highway in the Southeastern United States that runs from western Mississippi to southern Florida. It was established in 1933 as a route between Pensacola and Apalachicola, Florida, and has since been extended westward into Mississippi and eastward across the Florida Peninsula. It runs along much of the Gulf Coast between Mobile, Alabama, and Crystal River, Florida, including extensive sections closely following the coast between Mobile and St. Marks, Florida. The highway&#x27;s western terminus is with US 84 in Bude, Mississippi. Its eastern terminus is Palm Beach, Florida, at State Road A1A (SR A1A) near the Mar-a-Lago resort.

==Route description==
U.S. 98&#x27;s western terminus is in Mississippi, and its eastern terminus is in Florida. Much of its route through Alabama and Florida falls within coastal counties.

===Mississippi===

US 98 enters the state from the southeast and immediately widens to four lanes. It bypasses Lucedale to the north, and an interchange with Mississippi Highway 63 provides four-laned access to Pascagoula on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, increasing road capacity for hurricane evacuations. At Hattiesburg, an interchange with U.S. Route 49 provides four-laned access to Gulfport (to the south) and Jackson (to the north). The road continues west from its intersection with US 49 to Interstate 59 at exit 59, with which it is concurrent through exit 65 (Hardy Street). The highway runs westward through Columbia before meeting US 51 in McComb. It then joins Interstate 55 from exit 15 (South McComb) to exit 20 (Summit). The last remaining two-laned section of US 98 in Mississippi then runs northwestward to its terminus near Bude in Meadville at US 84.

US 98 serves as a primary hurricane evacuation route in southern Mississippi, connecting cities along the Mississippi Sound to inland destinations further north.

The Mississippi section of US 98 is defined in Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3.

===Alabama===
In Alabama, US 98 is paired with unsigned State Route 42 (SR 42). The route enters Alabama from the east near Lillian in rural Baldwin County. At Daphne, US 98 begins a concurrency with US 90. US 90 and 98 junction I-10 at Daphne on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, then again on the western side of the bay as they enter downtown Mobile. As the two routes approach the Mobile River, US 98 is split into two routes, with a US 98 Truck route crossing the Mobile River via the Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge, co-signed with US 90. Passenger car traffic passes directly into town under the Mobile River via the Bankhead Tunnel. Once the truck route rejoins the main route in downtown Mobile, US 98 assumes a northwestward trajectory, and enters Mississippi near the community of Wilmer in western Mobile County. US 98 is the southern terminus of two major U.S. highways: US 31, at Spanish Fort, and US 45 in Mobile.

The safety of the route, or the lack thereof, has earned the road the nickname &quot;Bloody 98&quot;. The existing route between Semmes and the Mississippi state line is a two-lane undivided highway, and widening the route has been delayed due to a lack of budget and concern over pollution of Big Creek Lake, which supplies drinking water to the city of Mobile and other area towns. A project to construct a bypass route, State Route 158, was completed in October 2023, at a cost of $200 million.

===Florida===

Within Florida, US 98 is marked as an east–west road from the Alabama-Florida border to Perry. Throughout the rest of the state, the road is marked as a north–south road.

Concurrencies include US 441 from Royal Palm Beach to Okeechobee, US 27 from South Sebring to West Frostproof, US 17 from Fort Meade to Bartow, US 301 from Clinton Heights to Moss Town, SR 50 from Ridge Manor to Brooksville, SR 50A then US 41 in Brooksville, US 19 from Chassahowitzka to Perry, ALT US 27 from Chiefland to Perry, US 319 in Medart and from St. Theresa to Port St. Joe, and US 90 in Pensacola. The hidden designation for most of US 98 across the panhandle of the state of Florida is State Route 30. Between Chassahowitzka and Palm Beach, the hidden designation is State Route 700. There is a 60 mph speed limit east of Tyndall Air Force Base outside of Panama City all the way to Perry.

==History==

US 98 was first commissioned in 1934. At that time, its entire route was within Florida, traveling from Pensacola to Apalachicola. In 1952, the eastern end was extended to its present terminus in Palm Beach, Florida. In 1955, the western terminus was extended westward to Natchez, Mississippi. In 1999, the western end of US 98 was truncated to its intersection with US 84 at Meadville, Mississippi, although it continued to be signed concurrently with US 84 to Washington, Mississippi until 2008.

<text>Vespoidea is a superfamily of wasps in the order Hymenoptera. Vespoidea includes wasps with a large variety of lifestyles including eusocial, social, and solitary habits, predators, scavengers, parasitoids, and some herbivores.

== Description ==
Vespoid wasp females have antennae with 10 flagellomeres, while males have 11 flagellomeres. The edge of the pronotum reaches or passes the tegula. Many species display some level of sexual dimorphism. Most species have fully developed wings, but some have reduced or absent wings in one or both sexes. As in other Aculeata, only the females are ever capable of stinging.

==Phylogenetics and taxonomy==
Research based on four nuclear genes (elongation factor-1α F2 copy, long-wavelength rhodopsin, wingless and the D2–D3 regions of 28S ribosomal RNA—2700 bp in total) suggests the historical view of family relationships need to be changed, with Rhopalosomatidae as a sister group of the Vespidae and the clade Rhopalosomatidae + Vespidae as sister to all other classical vespoids and apoids. In a study in 2008, the superfamily Apoidea was found to nest within the Vespoidea, suggesting the dismantling of Vespoidea (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) into many smaller superfamilies: Formicoidea, Scolioidea, Tiphioidea, Thynnoidea, and Pompiloidea in addition to a much more narrowly defined Vespoidea (restricted to Rhopalosomatidae and Vespidae). Their research also found families Mutillidae, Tiphiidae, and Bradynobaenidae to be paraphyletic.

A later study in 2013 confirmed the need for revision of high-level relationships, and the pattern of sister-group relationships within the putative Vespoidea largely matched the same basic pattern as the 2008 study. This study also noted a paraphyletic Bradynobaenidae and Tiphiidae.

The extinct family of Armaniidae also was formerly considered to be a group of &quot;ant-like wasps&quot; and was also classified under Vespoidea. However, additional work by Borysenko in 2017 found these species to be basal members of Formicidae, placing three genera under Sphecomyrminae and considering the rest &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

===Families retained in Vespoidea===

* Mutillidae – velvet ants/velvet wasps
* Myrmosidae – myrmosid wasps
* Pompilidae – spider wasps
* Sapygidae – sapygid wasps

=== Families represented by Scolioidea ===
* Scoliidae – scoliid wasps

=== Families represented by Tiphioidea ===
* Bradynobaenidae – bradynobaenid wasps
* Sierolomorphidae – sierolomorphid wasps
* Tiphiidae – tiphiid wasps

=== Families represented by Thynnoidea ===
* Chyphotidae – chyphotid wasps
* Thynnidae – thynnid wasps

<text>Sir James David Edgar, (August 10, 1841 – July 31, 1899) was a Canadian politician.

In his twenties, Edgar was a law student, legal editor of the &quot;Toronto Globe&quot;, an alderman on Toronto&#x27;s city council and an organizer for the Liberal Party in Ontario. He was also rare among English Canadians of the time for his sympathy for the rights of French-Canadians. Edgar was married to Matilda Ridout and together they had nine children.

Born in Hatley, Canada East (later Quebec), Edgar was educated at the Lennoxville Classical School (now Bishop&#x27;s College School), where his father James Edgar was appointed the Second Master by the Rev. Lucius Doolittle, Rector of Sherbrooke. It was reported that despite the young age than his classmates, he is a hard-working student in his class. After the death of his father in 1850, he continued his education in Quebec City. He moved to Toronto as an adult and became a lawyer in 1864. He was elected an alderman in 1866, and was a supporter of George Brown and the Reform Party. He ran as a Liberal in the 1871 Ontario provincial election, but was defeated by a margin of four votes in his attempt to win a seat in the provincial legislature.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1872 federal election, and became Whip in the caucus of Alexander Mackenzie. He helped bring down the Conservative government over the Pacific Scandal. However, despite the election of a Liberal government in the ensuing election, Edgar was defeated in his own riding.

In 1874, he started a railway company called the Ontario and Pacific Junction Railway. This was an attempt to build a line between Toronto and Lake Nipissing. In 1881, it was renamed the &quot;Ontario and Sault Ste. Marie Railway&quot;. Both ventures failed to win a contract. Fred Cumberland, a partner in the O&amp;PJR venture, formed a rival company called the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. In 1888, the N&amp;PJR merged with the Grand Trunk Railway.

Edgar was undaunted by these setbacks and in 1889 started a new company called the Belt Line Railway in Toronto. The city&#x27;s steep ravines made access to some areas very difficult. The land developers of these areas required either a commuter railway or a system of bridges to ease access to their properties for buyers. This new venture sought to build a commuter rail line in Toronto connecting downtown with undeveloped neighbourhoods as far north as Eglinton Avenue between the Don River and the Humber River. Eventually two rail loops were built with 44 stations in total. The passenger railway opened in 1892 but ran for only two years, four months before going bankrupt. (The city built bridges, eventually.)

He used his experience to become the Liberal&#x27;s railway critic when he returned to Parliament (and the Opposition benches) through an 1884 by-election.

In the 1880s, Edgar became a vocal opponent of the Protestant Protective Association, an anti-Catholic political party associated with the Ontario Conservative Party. He argued in favour of tolerance and cooperation between English and French Canadians as well as between Protestants and Catholics. He also argued against the concept of Imperial Federation, for greater Canadian independence from Britain, and in favour of reciprocity with the United States.

When the Liberals formed a government under Wilfrid Laurier following the 1896 federal election, Edgar was nominated to become Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and was given a knighthood by Queen Victoria. Edgar was in poor health, however, and died in 1899 prior to the end of this term.

<doc id="889708" wikidata="Q27794621" url="?curid=889708" title="Rhotacism">
<text>Rhotacism ( ) or rhotacization is a sound change that converts one consonant (usually a voiced alveolar consonant: , , , or ) to a rhotic consonant in a certain environment. The most common may be of to . When a dialect or member of a language family resists the change and keeps a sound, this is sometimes known as &quot;zetacism&quot;.

The term comes from the Greek letter &quot;rho&quot;, denoting .

==Albanian==
The southern (Tosk) dialects, the base of Standard Albanian, changed to , but the northern (Gheg) dialects did not:
* vs. &#x27;the voice&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;the knee&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;Albania&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;Albania&#x27; (older name of the country)
* vs. &#x27;burnt&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;wood&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;did&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;caught&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;dust&#x27;
* vs. &#x27;love&#x27;

==Aramaic==
In Aramaic, Proto-Semitic &quot;n&quot; changed to &quot;r&quot; in a few words:

* &quot;bar&quot; &quot;son&quot; as compared to Hebrew בֵן &quot;ben&quot; (from Proto-Semitic *&quot;bnu&quot;)
* &quot;trên&quot; and &quot;tartên&quot; &quot;two&quot; (masculine and feminine form respectively) as compared to Demotic Arabic &quot;tnēn&quot; and &quot;tintēn&quot;, from Proto-Semitic *&quot;ṯnaimi&quot; and *&quot;ṯnataimi&quot;. Compare also Aramaic &quot;tinyânâ&quot; &quot;the second one&quot;, without the shift.

==Basque==
Aquitanian *&quot;l&quot; changed to the tapped &quot;r&quot; between vowels in Basque. It can be observed in words borrowed from Latin; for example, Latin &quot;caelum&quot; (meaning &quot;sky, heaven&quot;) became &quot;zeru&quot; in Basque (&quot;caelum&quot; &gt; &quot;celu&quot; &gt; &quot;zeru&quot;; compare &quot;cielo&quot; in Spanish). The original &quot;l&quot; is preserved in the Souletin dialect: &quot;caelum&quot; &gt; &quot;celu&quot; &gt; &quot;zelü&quot;.

==Finnish==
Western dialects of Finnish are characterised by the pronunciation or of the consonant written &quot;d&quot; in Standard Finnish &quot;kahden kesken- kahren kesken&quot; (two together = one on one). The reconstructed older pronunciation is .

==Goidelic languages==
In Manx, Scottish Gaelic and some dialects of Irish, becomes in a variety of consonant clusters, often with nasalization of the following vowel. For example, the cluster developed into , as in Scottish Gaelic ‘hill’. Within Ireland, this phenomenon is most prevalent in northern dialects and absent from the most southern dialects. Some examples of rhotacized clusters include (&quot;cnó&quot;), (&quot;mná&quot;), (&quot;gnó&quot;), and (&quot;tnáith&quot;), while (&quot;snámh&quot;) is never rhotacized even in the most innovative dialects. This can lead to interesting pairs such as nominative &quot;an sneachta&quot; versus genitive &quot;an tsneachta&quot; .

==Germanic languages==

All surviving Germanic languages, which are members of the North and West Germanic families, changed to , implying a more approximant-like rhotic consonant in Proto-Germanic. As attested by runes, the shift affected Old Norse later than the Continental Germanic languages. Some languages later changed all forms to &quot;r&quot;, but Gothic, an extinct East Germanic language, did not undergo rhotacism.

Note that the Modern German forms have levelled the rhotic consonant to forms that did not originally have it. However, the original sound can still be seen in some nouns such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;being&quot; (from the same root as &quot;war&quot;/&quot;waren&quot;) as well as &quot;&quot;, &quot;loss&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;dungeon&quot; (both from the same root as &quot;verlieren&quot;/&quot;verloren&quot;).

Because of the presence of words that did not undergo rhotacisation from the same root as those that did, the result of the process remains visible in a few modern English word pairs:
* &quot;is&quot; and &quot;are&quot; (PGmc. &quot;&quot; vs &quot;&quot;)
* &quot;was&quot; and &quot;were (&quot;PGmc. &quot;*wesaną&quot; vs &quot;*wēz)&quot;
* the comparative and superlative suffixes &quot;-er&quot; and &quot;-est&quot; (PGmc. &quot;&quot; vs &quot;&quot;) and derived words such as &quot;more&quot; and &quot;most&quot; (&quot;&quot; vs &quot;&quot;), &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot; (&quot;&quot; vs &quot;&quot;), etc
* &quot;rise&quot; and &quot;rear&quot; (as in &#x27;to bring up&#x27;; PGmc. &quot;&quot; vs &quot;&quot;)
* &quot;loss&quot; and &quot;forlorn&quot; (PGmc. &quot;&quot; vs &quot;&quot;)

===English===

Intervocalic and are commonly lenited to in most accents of North American and Australian English and some accents of Irish English and English English, a process known as tapping or less accurately as flapping: &quot;got a lot of&quot; becomes . Contrast is usually maintained with , and the sound is rarely perceived as .

===German===
In Central German dialects, especially Rhine Franconian and Hessian, is frequently realised as in intervocalic position. The change also occurs in Mecklenburg dialects. Compare &quot;Borrem&quot; (Central Hessian) and &quot;Boden&quot; (Standard German).

==Romance languages and Latin==

===Latin===
Reflecting a highly-regular change in pre-Classical Latin, intervocalic in Old Latin, which is assumed to have been pronounced , invariably became &quot;r&quot;, resulting in pairs such as these:

*flōs — flōrem&quot; (Old Latin flōsem&quot;)
*genus — generis&quot; (from *geneses&quot;, cf. Sanskrit &quot;janasas&quot;)
*rōbus, rōbustus&quot; — rōbur&quot;, &quot;corrōborāre&quot; (verb from )
*&quot;jūstus&quot; — &quot;de jūre&quot; (from &quot;de jouse&quot;)
*est&quot; — erō&quot; (from &quot;esō&quot;)
*gessī&quot;, gestō&quot; — gerō&quot; (from gesō&quot;)

Intervocalic &quot;s&quot; in Classical Latin suggests either borrowing (&quot;rosa&quot;) or reduction of an earlier &quot;ss&quot; after a long vowel or a diphthong (&quot;pausa&quot; &lt; &quot;paussa&quot;, &quot;vīsum&quot; &lt; &quot;*vīssum&quot; &lt; &quot;*weid-tom&quot;). The &quot;s&quot; was preserved initially (&quot;septum&quot;) and finally and in consonant clusters.

Old Latin became in Late Latin by analogy with the rhotacised forms in other cases such as genitive, dative and accusative &quot;honoris&quot;, &quot;honori&quot;, &quot;honorem&quot;.

Another form of rhotacism in Latin was dissimilation of &quot;d&quot; to &quot;r&quot; before another &quot;d&quot; and dissimilation of &quot;l&quot; to &quot;r&quot; before another &quot;l&quot;, resulting in pairs such as these:

*medius&quot; — merīdiēs&quot; (instead of *&quot;medi-diēs&quot;)
*caelum&quot; — caeruleus&quot; (instead of *&quot;cael-uleus&quot;)

The phenomenon was noted by the Romans themselves:
===Neapolitan===
In Neapolitan, rhotacism affects words that etymologically contained intervocalic or initial , when this is followed by a vowel; and when is followed by another consonant. This last characteristic, however, is not very common in modern speech.

* &gt; Neap. &quot;tooth&quot;
* &gt; Neap. &quot;foot&quot;
* &gt; Neap. (or ) &quot;money&quot;

===Portuguese and Galician===
In Galician-Portuguese, rhotacism occurred from to , mainly in consonant clusters ending in such as in the words &quot;obrigado&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot; (originally from &quot;obliged [in honourably serving my Sir]&quot;); &quot;praia&quot;, &quot;beach&quot;; &quot;prato&quot;, &quot;plate&quot; or &quot;dish&quot;; &quot;branco&quot;, &quot;white&quot;; &quot;prazer&quot;/&quot;pracer&quot;, &quot;pleasure&quot;; &quot;praça&quot;/&quot;praza&quot;, &quot;square&quot;. Compare Spanish &quot;obligado&quot; (obliged), &quot;playa, plato, blanco, placer, plaza&quot; from Latin &quot;obligatus, plagia, platus, blancus&quot; (Germanic origin), &quot;placere&quot; (verb), &quot;platea&quot;.

In contemporary Brazilian Portuguese, rhotacism of in the syllable coda is characteristic of the Caipira dialect. Further rhotacism in the nationwide vernacular includes &quot;planta&quot;, &quot;plant&quot;, as , &quot;lava&quot;, &quot;lava&quot;, as (then homophonous with &quot;larva&quot;, worm/maggot), &quot;lagarto&quot;, &quot;lizard&quot;, as (in dialects with guttural coda &quot;r&quot; instead of a tap) and &quot;advogado&quot;, &quot;lawyer&quot;, as . The nonstandard patterns are largely marginalised, and rhotacism is regarded as a sign of speech-language pathology or illiteracy.

===Romanesco Italian===
Rhotacism, in Romanesco, shifts &quot;l&quot; to &quot;r&quot; before a consonant, like certain Andalusian dialects of Spanish. Thus, Latin &quot;altus&quot; (tall) is &quot;alto&quot; in Italian but becomes &quot;arto&quot; in Romanesco. Rhotacism used to happen when &quot;l&quot; was preceded by a consonant, as in the word &quot;ingrese&quot; (English), but modern speech has lost that characteristic.

Another change related to &quot;r&quot; was the shortening of the geminated &quot;rr&quot;, which is not rhotacism. Italian &quot;errore&quot;, &quot;guerra&quot; and &quot;marrone&quot; &quot;error&quot;, &quot;war&quot;, &quot;brown&quot; become &quot;erore&quot;, &quot;guera&quot; and &quot;marone&quot;.

===Romanian===
In Romanian, rhotacism shifted intervocalic &quot;l&quot; to &quot;r&quot; and &quot;n&quot; to &quot;r&quot;.

Thus, Latin &quot;caelum&quot; ‘sky; heaven’ became Romanian &quot;cer&quot;, Latin &quot;fenestra&quot; ‘window’ Romanian &quot;fereastră&quot; and Latin &quot;felicitas&quot; ‘happiness’ Romanian &quot;fericire&quot;.

Some northern Romanian dialects and Istro-Romanian also changed all intervocalic to in words of Latin origin. For example, Latin &quot;bonus&quot; became Istro-Romanian &quot;bur&quot;: compare to standard Daco-Romanian &quot;bun&quot;.

===Sicilian===
Rhotacism is particularly widespread in the island of Sicily, but it is almost completely absent in the Sicilian varieties of the mainland (Calabrese and Salentino). It affects intervocalic and initial : &quot;cura&quot; from Latin 
&quot;caudam&quot;, &quot;peri&quot; from Latin &quot;pedem&quot;, &quot;&#x27;reci&quot; from Latin &quot;decem&quot;.

===Spanish===
In Andalusian Spanish, particularly in Seville, at the end of a syllable before another consonant, &quot;l&quot; is replaced with &quot;r&quot;: &quot;Huerva&quot; for &quot;Huelva&quot;. The reverse occurs in Caribbean Spanish: &quot;Puelto Rico&quot; for &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; (lambdacism).

===Other languages===
Rhotacism (&quot;mola&quot; &gt; &quot;mora&quot;, &quot;filum&quot; &gt; &quot;fir&quot;, &quot;sal&quot; &gt; &quot;sare&quot;) exists in some Gallo-Italic languages as well: Lombard (Western and ) and Ligurian.

In Umbrian but not Oscan, rhotacism of intervocalic &quot;s&quot; occurred as in Latin.

==Turkic==
Among the Turkic languages, the Oghur branch exhibits , opposing to the rest of Turkic, which exhibits . In this case, rhotacism refers to the development of , , and to , , in this branch.

==South Slavic languages==
(This section relies on the treatment in Greenberg 1999.)

In some South Slavic languages, rhotacism occasionally changes a voiced palatal fricative to a dental or alveolar tap or trill between vowels:

*&quot;moreš&quot; (Slovene, Kajkavian Croatian) &#x27;you can&#x27; from earlier &quot;možešь&quot;
*&quot;kdor&quot; (Slovene) from earlier *&quot;-&quot;

The beginning of the change is attested in the Freising manuscripts from the 10th century AD, which show both the archaism (&quot;ise&quot; &#x27;which&#x27; &lt; *&quot;jь-že&quot;) and the innovation (&quot;tere&quot; &#x27;also&#x27; &lt; *&quot;te-&quot;). The shift is also found in individual lexical items in Bulgarian dialects, &quot;дорде&quot; &#x27;until&#x27; (&lt; *&quot;--dĕ&quot;) and Macedonian, &quot;сеѓере&quot; (archaic: &#x27;always&#x27; &lt;&quot;*&quot;-&quot;&quot;). However, the results of the sound change have largely been reversed by lexical replacement in dialects in Serbia and Bosnia from the 14th century.

Dialects in Croatia and Slovenia have preserved more of the lexical items with the change and have even extended grammatical markers in &quot;-r&quot; from many sources that formally merged with the rhotic forms that arose from the sound change: Slovene dialect &quot;nocor&quot; &#x27;tonight&#x27; (&lt; *&quot;not&#x27;ь-sь-ǫ-&quot; + &quot;-r-&quot;) on the model of &quot;večer&quot; &#x27;evening&#x27; (&lt; *&quot;večerъ&quot;). The reversal of the change is evident in dialects in Serbia in which the &quot;-r-&quot; formant is systematically removed: Serbian &quot;veče&quot; &#x27;evening&#x27;.

<text>Suvanant Kongying (; ; born 22 July 1978 in Bangkok) also known by her nickname Kob (; ), is a Thai actress. She was the lead actress in many Thai lakorns in the 1990s-2000s. She has appeared in several &quot;lakorns&quot; (dramas), including &quot;Dao pra sook&quot; with Sornram Teppitak, in which she played Dao, the main character. She has been voted people&#x27;s choice winner for top actress for many years. She&#x27;s considered Thailand&#x27;s most famous actress and her leading lakorn partner is Sornram Teppitak.

==Early life==
Suvanant was born in Sirirat Hospital, and lived with her grandmother at Chachoengsao when she was a baby. She moved to Bangkok with her family when she was three to four years old. Her father, Amnuay Kongying (d. November 2001), was a teacher, and her mother, Ubonrat Kongying, works at the ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative. She also has a younger brother named Apisith Golf Kongying. Suvanant began acting from a very young age.

==Career==
Her first performance in a traditional Thai folklore drama won her widespread popularity and her first major acting award, to which she has since added many. She went on to star in &quot;Dao pra sook&quot; (&quot;Morning Star&quot;), in which she played a teenager abandoned as a baby but who grows up to find that she is after all wanted by many people, including the leading male character portrayed by Sornram Theppitak.

She is now married to Danuporn Poonnakan also known as Brook who had been her acting partner.

Suvanant graduated with a bachelor in Communication Arts from Rangsit University. She was paid an undisclosed sum of money – believed to be millions of baht – to act as a presenter for &quot;Mistine&quot; cosmetics. Suvanant is also a professional ice skating champion.

In 2003 a Cambodian tabloid reported that Suvanant Kongying made a speech claiming that Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand, the allegation which was later found to be groundless. This prompted the 2003 Phnom Penh riots, in which the Thai embassy in Cambodia was destroyed.

Suvanant is also known for co-hosting the famous show Jun pun dao with Nattawut Skidjai.

<text>Steven Adler (born Michael Coletti; January 22, 1965) is an American musician. He was the drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s.

Adler was fired from Guns N&#x27; Roses over his heroin addiction in 1990, following which he reformed his pre-Guns N&#x27; Roses band Road Crew and briefly joined BulletBoys. During the 2000s, Adler was the drummer of the band Adler&#x27;s Appetite, and from 2012, he had held the same position in the band Adler. In early 2017, he declared that he had no intention to continue with the band and that the band has been dissolved, with the reason being his lack of interest in performing during poorly attended concerts.

He appeared on the second (2008) and fifth (2011) seasons of the reality TV show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, as well as on the first season of its spin-off &quot;Sober House&quot; (2009). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses.

== Life and career ==

=== 1965–1984: Early life and career ===
Steven Adler was born Michael Coletti in Cleveland, Ohio, to an Italian-American father, Michael Coletti, and a Jewish-American mother, Deanna. After his father left the family, his mother moved with her children to Los Angeles, California. Adler was originally named after his father at birth, but his mother renamed him Steven when she returned to her parents because Jewish naming conventions forbid naming children after living relatives. He took his mother&#x27;s surname after she married Melvin Adler, who adopted her two oldest children (including Steven). He has one older brother, Kenny, and a younger half-brother, Jamie. Adler grew up in the San Fernando Valley until the age of 13, when he was sent to live with his grandparents in Hollywood due to his bad behavior. While attending Bancroft Junior High School, Adler befriended Saul Hudson, later known as Slash; they met when Adler had a skateboarding accident and Slash stopped to help him. After ninth grade, Adler returned to his parents&#x27; house in the Valley for the remainder of high school, during which time he learned to play drums.

After his return to Hollywood in 1983, Adler auditioned for Sunset Strip staple London. When the audition proved unsuccessful, he formed the band Road Crew—named after the Motörhead song &quot;(We Are) The Road Crew&quot;—with his childhood friend Slash. They placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what would become the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Rocket Queen.&quot; Slash disbanded the group the following year due to their inability to find an adequate lead vocalist, as well as Adler&#x27;s laziness compared to himself and McKagan. Adler then briefly joined a local band known as Hollywood Rose, which featured singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin (who left shortly after).

=== 1985–1990: Guns N&#x27; Roses ===

In June 1985, Adler joined Guns N&#x27; Roses, which was newly founded by Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, and L.A. Guns members Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner. After the original drummer Gardner quit, Adler and Slash joined their former Road Crew bandmate Duff McKagan (who joined in March 1985) to complete the line-up. They played nightclubs—such as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadour—and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. After being scouted by several major record labels, the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986.

In July 1987, Guns N&#x27; Roses released its debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, which to date has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, 18 million of which were in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US. In December, during a tour with Alice Cooper, an intoxicated Adler broke his hand when he punched a streetlight after a barroom brawl; Fred Coury of Cinderella was brought in as his substitute for several shows until he recovered. In November 1988, Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;, which sold over five million copies in the US alone, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;.

Adler was again absent during a performance at the American Music Awards in January 1989; Don Henley filled in for him on drums. His absence was originally attributed to a case of the flu, but it was later revealed that Adler had been in a drug rehabilitation program at the time. The following October, during a show as opening act for The Rolling Stones, Axl Rose threatened to leave the band if certain members of the band did not stop &quot;dancing with Mr. Brownstone,&quot; a reference to their song of the same name about heroin use. Adler was among those who promised to clean up, but he continued to struggle with his addiction.

Adler was briefly fired from the band over his drug use in early 1990, but he was reinstated after signing a contract in which he vowed to stop taking drugs. However, by the time the band entered the studio to record the song &quot;Civil War&quot;, his addiction had become so severe that he was unable to perform. By Adler&#x27;s own admission, he tried to play the song &quot;20, maybe 30 times&quot;. The song&#x27;s drum track had to be heavily edited for his bandmates to be able to play along with it. When problems in the studio continued, causing recording sessions to abort for several days at a time, Adler was formally fired from Guns N&#x27; Roses on July 11, 1990. He had played his final show with the band on April 7 at Farm Aid IV.

Izzy Stradlin, who left the band in November 1991, later stated that replacing Adler with Matt Sorum of The Cult had a big impact on the band&#x27;s sound. In response to an interviewer&#x27;s suggestion that the line-up change had turned Guns N&#x27; Roses from a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band into a heavy metal one, Stradlin said, &quot;Yeah, a big musical difference. ... [Our songs] were written with Steve playing the drums and his sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their feel. When that was gone, it was just...unbelievable, weird. Nothing worked. I would have preferred to continue with Steve, but we&#x27;d had two years off and we couldn&#x27;t wait any longer.&quot;

=== 1990–2002: Post-Guns N&#x27; Roses troubles and hiatus ===
Following his departure from Guns N&#x27; Roses, he was one of several drummers who auditioned to join AC/DC. However Adler claims that AC/DC&#x27;s manager withdrew an offer, following Axl Rose announcing Adler&#x27;s firing and branding him a drug addict onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler&#x27;s persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, &quot;I wish I could say that I did a lot of traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was sit on the couch and get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time.&quot;

A year after his dismissal, in July 1991, Adler filed a lawsuit against his former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates, contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox interfered with his concentration. He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band, stating, &quot;I was told that every time I did heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. ... What these contracts actually said was that the band were paying me $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn&#x27;t like me any more and just wanted me gone.&quot; The case was settled out of court in 1993; Adler received a back-payment check of $2,250,000 and was granted 15% of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure.

On May 5, 1995, Adler was arrested at his home in Calabasas on a felony charge of heroin possession.

In 1996, Adler suffered a stroke and was briefly comatose after taking a particularly potent speedball—a cocktail of heroin and cocaine used intravenously—which caused a temporary paralysis of the left side of his face, resulting in a speech impediment. The following year, he pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in relation to a domestic violence charge involving a woman with whom he had been living; he was sentenced to four days in jail, three years&#x27; probation, and mandatory drug counseling.

In June 1998, Adler joined the newly reformed hard rock band BulletBoys, along with future Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist DJ Ashba. The group recorded an album and announced a US summer tour with Faster Pussycat, Bang Tango and Enuff Z&#x27;nuff. However, Adler&#x27;s return to music was cut short the following September, when he pleaded no contest to two counts of battery stemming from attacks on two other women in separate domestic violence incidents. He was sentenced to a 150-day term in prison and three years&#x27; probation, with the condition of undergoing a year of domestic violence counseling and a ban on using illegal drugs.

=== 2003–2011: Adler&#x27;s Appetite and reality TV ===

In 2003, Adler formed the band Suki Jones, later renamed Adler&#x27;s Appetite, with singer Jizzy Pearl, former Slash&#x27;s Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli, Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, and former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane. With an ever-changing line-up due to members&#x27; previous commitments, the band toured the US and Europe throughout 2003 and 2004, playing mostly songs off Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; debut album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, as well as material by Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, and Queen. In September 2003, Adler&#x27;s Appetite performed a show at the Key Club in Hollywood, where they were joined on stage by Adler&#x27;s former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Slash and Izzy Stradlin, for renditions of &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot;, and &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;.

In January 2005, Adler&#x27;s Appetite—minus Brent Muscat, who had departed the band—released through their official website a self-titled EP, which featured four original songs and the covers &quot;Hollywood&quot; by Thin Lizzy and &quot;Draw the Line&quot; by Aerosmith. The release was followed by a tour of the US, Europe, Japan, and Argentina. Later that year, the band announced plans to release a full-length album through Shrapnel Records, but it failed to materialize. In July 2007, the group played another show at the Key Club, as part of their tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, during which they were joined on stage by former Guns N&#x27; Roses members Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan. Although Slash was also in attendance, he did not join the band on stage, stating that he did not want to encourage the notion of a Guns N&#x27; Roses reunion.

In 2008, Adler participated in the second season of the reality TV show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;. The show&#x27;s resident medical expert, Drew Pinsky, regarded Adler as the &quot;problem child&quot; of the group; he described his behavior as &quot;suicidal&quot; and revealed that Adler had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks prior to entering rehab. Adler also participated in the first season of the &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; spin-off &quot;Sober House&quot;. During the show&#x27;s filming in July, an intoxicated Adler became so aggressive towards his cast mates that he was arrested at the &quot;Sober House&quot; premises. He was convicted of being under the influence of a controlled substance and sentenced to community service. The following January, he was arrested again for failure to complete his community service in the time frame stipulated by the judge.

In 2010, Adler collaborated with his former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Slash on the latter&#x27;s self-titled debut solo album, which was released in April. He appeared on the track &quot;Baby Can&#x27;t Drive&quot;, along with Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Alice Cooper, and Nicole Scherzinger. The song was featured on an expanded edition of the album released by &quot;Classic Rock&quot;. The following July, Adler&#x27;s Appetite—consisting of Adler, singer Rick Stitch, guitarists Michael Thomas and Alex Grossi, and bassist Chip Z&#x27;nuff—released the single &quot;Alive&quot;, in conjunction with the release of Adler&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Appetite for Destruction: Sex, and Drugs, and Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;. In December, the band released two more singles, entitled &quot;Stardog&quot; and &quot;Fading&quot;. In 2011, following another relapse, Adler participated in the fifth season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;.

===2011–2016: Adler and guest appearance with Guns N&#x27; Roses===
In 2011, Adler formed a new band, simply called Adler, with guitarist Lonny Paul, who had been a member of Adler&#x27;s Appetite prior to the breakup, and singer-guitarist Jacob Bunton of Lynam and formerly of Mars Electric, with the lineup later rounded out by former L.A. Guns member Johnny Martin on bass. Adler stated, &quot;I love the music that we&#x27;re creating! I haven&#x27;t been this excited about my band since the Guns N&#x27; Roses days.&quot; The band recorded their debut album in Los Angeles with producers Jeff Pilson and Jay Ruston. Titled &quot;Back from the Dead&quot;, the album features guest appearances from Slash and John 5, and was released on November 26, 2012, via New Ocean Media. The album&#x27;s release was preceded by the single &quot;The One That You Hated&quot;, which was released on April 10 via iTunes.

On April 14, 2012, Adler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the classic lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses. He headlined the induction ceremony with fellow inductees Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum, as well as former member Gilby Clarke and Slash&#x27;s collaborator Myles Kennedy. Adler stated that being inducted was &quot;an honor and a dream come true.&quot;

In late October and early November 2012, Adler played on the Kiss Kruise, which sailed from Florida to the Bahamas. These shows marked the band&#x27;s first-ever live performances. The following year, Adler&#x27;s scheduled U.S. tour was postponed when Adler checked into a rehab facility to &quot;continue working on his sobriety.&quot;

On the July 6, 2016 stop of the Not in This Lifetime... Tour in Cincinnati, Ohio, Adler joined Guns N&#x27; Roses for performances of &quot;Out Ta Get Me&quot; and &quot;My Michelle&quot;, which marked his first appearance with the band since his firing in 1990. He made other guest appearances during shows in Nashville, Los Angeles, and Buenos Aires. He was also rumored to take part in the band&#x27;s surprise April 1 show at the Troubadour, but had back surgery which forced him to pull out.

===2017–present: Adler&#x27;s Appetite reformation and solo career===

In 2018, guitarist Alex Grossi announced that Adler&#x27;s Appetite would return to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;.

<doc id="889722" wikidata="Q835032" url="?curid=889722" title="Coronagraph">
<text>A coronagraph is a telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star or other bright object so that nearby objects – which otherwise would be hidden in the object&#x27;s bright glare – can be resolved. Most coronagraphs are intended to view the corona of the Sun, but a new class of conceptually similar instruments (called &quot;stellar coronagraphs&quot; to distinguish them from &quot;solar coronagraphs&quot;) are being used to find extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks around nearby stars as well as host galaxies in quasars and other similar objects with active galactic nuclei (AGN).

==Invention==
The coronagraph was introduced in 1931 by the French astronomer Bernard Lyot; since then, coronagraphs have been used at many solar observatories. Coronagraphs operating within Earth&#x27;s atmosphere suffer from scattered light in the sky itself, due primarily to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in the upper atmosphere. At view angles close to the Sun, the sky is much brighter than the background corona even at high altitude sites on clear, dry days. Ground-based coronagraphs, such as the High Altitude Observatory&#x27;s Mark IV Coronagraph on top of Mauna Loa, use polarization to distinguish sky brightness from the image of the corona: both coronal light and sky brightness are scattered sunlight and have similar spectral properties, but the coronal light is Thomson-scattered at nearly a right angle and therefore undergoes scattering polarization, while the superimposed light from the sky near the Sun is scattered at only a glancing angle and hence remains nearly unpolarized.

==Design==

Coronagraph instruments are extreme examples of stray light rejection and precise photometry because the total brightness from the solar corona is less than one-millionth the brightness of the Sun. The apparent surface brightness is even fainter because, in addition to delivering less total light, the corona has a much greater apparent size than the Sun itself.

During a total solar eclipse, the Moon acts as an occluding disk and any camera in the eclipse path may be operated as a coronagraph until the eclipse is over. More common is an arrangement where the sky is imaged onto an intermediate focal plane containing an opaque spot; this focal plane is reimaged onto a detector. Another arrangement is to image the sky onto a mirror with a small hole: the desired light is reflected and eventually reimaged, but the unwanted light from the star goes through the hole and does not reach the detector. Either way, the instrument design must take into account scattering and diffraction to make sure that as little unwanted light as possible reaches the final detector. Lyot&#x27;s key invention was an arrangement of lenses with stops, known as Lyot stops, and baffles such that light scattered by diffraction was focused on the stops and baffles, where it could be absorbed, while light needed for a useful image missed them.

As examples, imaging instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope offer coronagraphic capability.

===Band-limited coronagraph===
A &quot;band-limited coronagraph&quot; uses a special kind of mask called a &quot;band-limited mask&quot;. This mask is designed to block light and also manage diffraction effects caused by removal of the light. The band-limited coronagraph has served as the baseline design for the canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder coronagraph. Band-limited masks will also be available on the James Webb Space Telescope.

===Phase-mask coronagraph===
A phase-mask coronagraph (such as the so-called four-quadrant phase-mask coronagraph) uses a transparent mask to shift the phase of the stellar light in order to create a self-destructive interference, rather than a simple opaque disc to block it.

===Optical vortex coronagraph===

An optical vortex coronagraph uses a phase-mask in which the phase shift varies azimuthally around the center. Several varieties of optical vortex coronagraphs exist:

* the &quot;scalar&quot; optical vortex coronagraph based on a phase ramp directly etched in a dielectric material, like fused silica.
* the &quot;vector(ial)&quot; vortex coronagraph employs a mask that rotates the angle of polarization of photons, and ramping this angle of rotation has the same effect as ramping a phase-shift. A mask of this kind can be synthesized by various technologies, ranging from liquid crystal polymer (same technology as in 3D television), and micro-structured surfaces (using microfabrication technologies from the microelectronics industry). Such a vector vortex coronagraph made out of liquid crystal polymers is currently in use at the 200-inch Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory. It has recently been operated with adaptive optics to image extrasolar planets.

This works with stars other than the sun because they are so far away their light is, for this purpose, a spatially coherent plane wave. The coronagraph using interference masks out the light along the center axis of the telescope, but allows the light from off axis objects through.

==Satellite-based coronagraphs==
Coronagraphs in outer space are much more effective than the same instruments would be if located on the ground. This is because the complete absence of atmospheric scattering eliminates the largest source of glare present in a terrestrial coronagraph. Several space missions such as NASA-ESA&#x27;s SOHO, and NASA&#x27;s SPARTAN, Solar Maximum Mission, and Skylab have used coronagraphs to study the outer reaches of the solar corona. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is able to perform coronagraphy using the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is able to perform coronagraphy using the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).

While space-based coronagraphs such as LASCO avoid the sky brightness problem, they face design challenges in stray light management under the stringent size and weight requirements of space flight. Any sharp edge (such as the edge of an occulting disk or optical aperture) causes Fresnel diffraction of incoming light around the edge, which means that the smaller instruments that one would want on a satellite unavoidably leak more light than larger ones would. The LASCO C-3 coronagraph uses both an external occulter (which casts shadow on the instrument) and an internal occulter (which blocks stray light that is Fresnel-diffracted around the external occulter) to reduce this leakage, and a complicated system of baffles to eliminate stray light scattering off the internal surfaces of the instrument itself.

=== Aditya-L1 ===

Aditya-L1 is a coronagraphy spacecraft developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and various Indian research institutes. The spacecraft aims to study the solar atmosphere and its impact on the Earth&#x27;s environment. It will be positioned approximately 1.5 million km from Earth in a halo orbit around the L1 Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun.

The primary payload, Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), will send 1,440 images of the sun daily to ground stations. The VELC payload has been developed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and will continuously observe the Sun&#x27;s corona from the L1 point.

==Extrasolar planets==
The coronagraph has recently been adapted to the challenging task of finding planets around nearby stars. While stellar and solar coronagraphs are similar in concept, they are quite different in practice because the object to be occulted differs by a factor of a million in linear apparent size. (The Sun has an apparent size of about 1900 arcseconds, while a typical nearby star might have an apparent size of 0.0005 and 0.002 arcseconds.) Earth-like exoplanet detection requires contrast. To achieve such contrast requires extreme optothermal stability.

A stellar coronagraph concept was studied for flight on the canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder mission. On ground-based telescopes, a stellar coronagraph can be combined with adaptive optics to search for planets around nearby stars.
In November 2008, NASA announced that a planet was directly observed orbiting the nearby star Fomalhaut. The planet could be seen clearly on images taken by Hubble&#x27;s Advanced Camera for Surveys&#x27; coronagraph in 2004 and 2006. The dark area hidden by the coronagraph mask can be seen on the images, though a bright dot has been added to show where the star would have been.
Up until the year 2010, telescopes could only directly image exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, it is easier to obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated that a vector vortex coronagraph could enable small telescopes to directly image planets. They did this by imaging the previously imaged HR 8799 planets using just a portion of the Hale Telescope.

<text>Roland Sebastian Martin (born November 14, 1968) is an American journalist. He was a commentator for TV One, the host of &quot;News One Now&quot;, and &quot;Washington Watch with Roland Martin&quot;.

He was also a CNN contributor, appearing on a variety of shows, including &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, Anderson Cooper&#x27;s &quot;AC360&quot;, and many others. In October 2008, he joined the &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot; as senior analyst. He currently hosts a web series, &quot;Roland Martin Unfiltered&quot; on YouTube.

Books authored by Martin include &quot;Speak, Brother! A Black Man&#x27;s View of America&quot;, &quot;Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith&quot; and &quot;The First: President Barack Obama&#x27;s Road to the White House as originally reported by Roland S. Martin&quot; and &quot;White Fear: How the Browning of America is Making White Folks Lose Their Minds&quot;.

==Life and career==
Martin was born in Houston, Texas. His maternal great-grandparents had migrated from Haiti to Louisiana, where his family originates. He graduated with a B.S. in journalism from Texas A&amp;M University and a master&#x27;s degree in Christian communications from Louisiana Baptist University. 

He is the former executive editor of the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;.

From 2005 to 2008, Martin hosted a morning radio talk show on WVON in Chicago, and was with CNN as a contributor from 2007 to 2013. He guest-hosted &quot;Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull&quot; while Brown was on maternity leave in April and May 2009.

He became the host of TV One&#x27;s first Sunday News show Washington Watch with Roland Martin in 2009. It ran for 4 years and is currently off the air.

In March 2013, Martin announced on Twitter that he was leaving CNN. His last day was on April 6, 2013.

It was announced on July 9, 2013, that Martin would be the host of TV One&#x27;s first live one-hour, weekday morning news program titled &quot;NewsOne Now&quot;. The program premiered on November 4, 2013. On December 7, 2017, Martin announced on air that TV One had canceled the show due to low ratings from Black viewers, but that he would still remain involved with the network. On January 14, 2018, it was announced that Martin had won two NAACP Image Awards for the show.

Also, Roland hosted a three-hour radio show called &quot;The Roland Martin Show&quot;. He currently hosts a web series, &quot;Roland Martin Unfiltered&quot; on YouTube.

==Issues==
Martin has defended Michael Steele and other black Republicans against charges of being &quot;Uncle Toms&quot;, arguing that the label is inappropriate.

==Controversy==
On February 5, 2012, Roland Martin&#x27;s Twitter account responded to an underwear advertisement featuring the association football player David Beckham, stating &quot;If a dude at your Super Bowl party is hyped about David Beckham&#x27;s H&amp;M underwear ad, smack the ish out of him!&quot; GLAAD (the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) responded on its website: “Martin’s tweets today advocating violence against gay people weren’t an accident — they are a part of a larger pattern for Martin. Anti-gay violence in America is a serious problem&quot;. In response to the tweets, it was reported that Martin had been suspended by CNN for the controversial remarks. His suspension was lifted on March 14, 2012.

In 2016, Martin was revealed to have leaked CNN town hall questions to former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, who then leaked them to Hillary Clinton’s camp when he was acting as guest-moderator. According to Politico, in an email the day before the March town hall to senior Clinton staffers, Brazile wrote: “From time to time I get the questions in advance” and included the text of a question about the death penalty. An email later obtained by Politico showed that the text of the question Brazile sent to the Clinton campaign was identical to a proposed question Martin had offered CNN.

<doc id="889724" wikidata="Q13014823" url="?curid=889724" title="Dao Pra Sook">
<text>Dao Pra Sook (; ; literally: &quot;Venus&quot;) is a Thai lakorn which has been remade several times. The latest of which aired on Thailand&#x27;s channel 7 in 1994 and was one of the most popular lakorns in the country. It starred Sornram Teppitak as &quot;Phak&quot; (Thai ภาคย์) and Suvanant Kongying as &quot;Daoprasook&quot; (Thai ดาว). The plot is about a wealthy man who &#x27;buys&#x27; a prostitute from a brothel and later falls in love with her. The shows were regarded by some as the most cliché (น้ำเน่า) soap opera in Thailand

==Summary==
A young woman gives birth at dawn to a baby girl, and leaves her daughter as soon as she can. The girl is later named Daoprasook by the nurses because the planet Venus (&quot;daoprasook&quot; in Thai) was visible at the time of her birth. Later, a childless couple adopts Dao. However, as soon as they adopt her, the wife becomes pregnant and gives birth to a daughter. The mother favors her own daughters more than Dao and treats her like a servant behind the father&#x27;s back. The young Dao is abused by her adoptive mother to the point where she decides to run away. Now on the streets, she uses her wits to survive until a kind-hearted prostitute takes her under her wings.

Years later, Dao is now a beautiful teenager who is forced to work to help the kind prostitute who raised her. Of course, she is too moral to sell her body so she would lead her customers into a darkened room where she would switch another prostitute for herself. She soon gains a certain amount of fame with many men seeking her &quot;service&quot;.

Khun Phak, a rich businessman meets Daoprasook and somehow makes a deal with the brothel&#x27;s managing woman. He &quot;buys&quot; her and forces her to move into his house. What occurred next can be imagined. Phak at first despises Dao for being a prostitute who gave one of his friends an STD. He decides to have her tested. The result puzzles him greatly, as she is perfectly healthy. All this while, Dao is abused by a servant called Maew in Phak&#x27;s house. Maew&#x27;s loyalty lies with Mayarasamee, who wants to marry the wealthy Phak. Undaunted, Dao proves herself to Phak to be a lady and endures all verbal abuses directed at her. The only kindness she finds and by which she is comforted is from an elderly man, a businessman like Phak. However, she has secretly fallen in love with Phak and vice versa. Although he has been able to restrain himself from sexually abusing Dao all this time, the news of Dao&#x27;s relationship with another man angered him. With a drunken rage, he storms into Dao&#x27;s bedroom and begins to make sexual advances on the young girl. Dao, in a state of shock that Phak, who has been a gentleman in this matter, is trying to abuse her tries to fight back, only later losing because of her feelings to Phak. That night, they consummated their love. The next morning, upon seeing the blood stain on the bedsheet, Phak realizes that he is the first for Dao. She grieves over her lost virginity, because it was something that she has guarded dearly for a long time.

In a twist of fate, the mother of Dao who abandoned her 18 years ago at the hospital meets her at Phak&#x27;s house and recognizes her first daughter when she sees a heart-shaped scar on Dao&#x27;s upper chest. She is now married with a young son. Convinced that the businessman (and he is) is in love with Dao, she reveals her secret to him, telling him that their affair produced a child, a daughter: Daoprasook. The truth comes out and changes Dao&#x27;s status immediately. She is now the daughter of a respected woman and a rich businessman. Still she yearns for love from Phak, who she considers to be her husband. He also happens to be related to her as he is a cousin to Dao&#x27;s mother, making her his second cousin. As can be expected from a lakorn, Phak reveals his true feelings to Dao and asks her to marry him. The lakorn ends with their lavish wedding.
