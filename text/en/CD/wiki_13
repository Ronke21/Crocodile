<text>Judith Viorst ( ; ; born February 2, 1931) is an American writer, newspaper journalist, and psychoanalysis researcher. 
She is known for her humorous observational poetry and for her children&#x27;s literature. This includes &quot;The Tenth Good Thing About Barney&quot; (about the death of a pet) and the &quot;Alexander&quot; series of short picture books, which includes &quot;Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day&quot; (1972), which has sold over two million copies.

Viorst is a 1952 graduate of the Newark College of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. In 1968, she signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. In the latter part of the 1970s, after two decades of writing for children and adults, Viorst turned to the study of Freudian psychology. In 1981, she became a research graduate at Washington Psychoanalytic Institute after six years of study.

==Early life==
A native of Newark, New Jersey, Viorst was raised in Maplewood, New Jersey, and attended Columbia High School. A graduate of the class of 1948, she was inducted into the school&#x27;s hall of fame in 1990.

===Writing for children===
Among Viorst&#x27;s books for children is the &quot;Alexander&quot; series (including &quot;Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day&quot;), whose narrator is a young boy who lives with his parents and two brothers, Anthony and Nick, who are named after Viorst&#x27;s own three sons.

Viorst&#x27;s book &quot;Sad Underwear&quot; (published in 1995) is a collection of poems that examines a wide variety of feelings and experiences from a child&#x27;s point of view. Her verses are accompanied by black and white illustrations by Richard Hull.

===Writing for adults===
Viorst&#x27;s books for adults include nonfiction psychology books such as &quot;Grown-up Marriage&quot;, &quot;Imperfect Control,&quot; and &quot;Necessary Losses&quot;. She has written nine books of poetry including &quot;Unexpectedly Eighty and Other Adaptations&quot;, &quot;When Did I Stop Being Twenty and Other Injustices: Selected Poems from Single to Mid-Life,&quot; and &quot;People and other Aggravations&quot;. Viorst is also a newspaper columnist and has written frequently for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; and has been a contributing editor to &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine.

Viorst also penned the musical &quot;Love &amp; Shrimp&quot; with Shelly Markam. The Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati hosted a performance of &quot;Love &amp; Shrimp&quot;, starring Deb Girdler, Pamela Myers and Shelley Bamberger, in the spring of 1999.

== Personal life ==
Viorst lives in Washington, D.C. Her late husband, political writer Milton Viorst, died of COVID-19 in 2022. They have three grown sons: Anthony, Nicholas, and Alexander; and seven grandchildren.

<doc id="877017" wikidata="Q1508519" url="?curid=877017" title="George Wallington">
<text>George Wallington (October 27, 1924 – February 15, 1993) was an American jazz pianist and composer. Born in Sicily, his career as a pianist began in the early 1940s, when he played with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker and contributed to the development of bebop. Following several years as a sideman during the late 1940s, he formed his own group, experimenting with trios and a string ensemble before settling upon a permanent quintet.

During the 1950s, Wallington&#x27;s quintet including rising stars Donald Byrd, Jackie McLean, and Phil Woods, but in 1960 he retired and moved to Florida to work for a family business. He returned to his previous career in the 1980s and made further recordings as a soloist before his death in 1993.

Noted for his technique and mastery of the developing styles of modern jazz, his contributions to the genre have been described as &quot;underrated.&quot; His compositions, however, became known through recordings by Woody Herman&#x27;s band and Miles Davis.

==Early life==
Wallington was born Giacinto Figlia (some sources give &quot;Giorgio&quot;) in Sicily. His date of birth has been given as both 1923 and 1924, with his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; identifying his date of birth as October 27, 1923 and other sources dating his birth to October 27, 1924.

Wallington moved to New York City with his family in 1925. His father sang opera and introduced his son to classical music, but after listening to saxophonist Lester Young and Count Basie&#x27;s orchestra, he &quot;was smitten with the expressive and emotional power of jazz.&quot;

He said that he acquired the name Wallington in high school because he liked &quot;to wear flashy clothes [...] and the kids in the neighborhood would say, &#x27;Hey, look at Wallington!&#x27;&quot; According to his brother Peter, however, the nickname was given to him by tenor saxophonist Stan Getz.

During his teenage years, he studied at Juilliard, but left school at the age of 15 or 16 to play piano in New York. He began to use &quot;Wallington&quot; as his stage name at nightclub gigs in the city during the early 1940s.

==Career==

=== 1943–1948: Bebop sideman ===
Dizzy Gillespie, a young trumpet player who was developing the style of jazz that came to be known as bebop, formed a band with bassist Oscar Pettiford, and drummer Max Roach to play regularly at the Onyx Club in 1943. An agreement with bandleader Cootie Williams to secure pianist Bud Powell for the gig fell apart, and after a short stint during which Billy Taylor used his intermissions from another club date to play with the group, Wallington was secured as the house pianist. He joined Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker at the Three Deuces and became well known on 52nd Street. Jazz clarinetist Joe Marsala hired Wallington to join his band for about a year before the pianist secured a range of opportunities.

Starting in 1946, Wallington was hired by numerous soloists – including Gerry Mulligan, Al Cohn, and Kai Winding – as a sideman. Others with whom he played include Serge Chaloff, Allen Eager, Terry Gibbs, Zoot Sims, and Red Rodney. His best-known compositions from this era are &quot;Lemon Drop,&quot; which was played by Woody Herman&#x27;s band, and &quot;Godchild,&quot; played for &quot;The Birth of the Cool&quot; recordings led by Miles Davis.

A recording session produced by Norman Granz included Charlie Parker and Wallington with strings but was not released. In fact, prior to 1949 Wallington had no records under his own name despite being one of the busiest musicians in New York. A recording of Wallington in Chaloff&#x27;s band, one of the few from this period, indicated his playing style was &quot;urgent and fiery...but with its own sense of time, touch and phrasing.&quot;

=== 1949–1960: Bandleader ===
His first opportunity to record as leader came in May 1949, when he recorded two trio tracks with bassist Curley Russell and drummer Charlie Perry for Savoy. The second half of this session included a septet with Jerry Lloyd, Kai Winding, Brew Moore, Mulligan, and the two members of his trio. Recording for his first trio album was completed two years later; Savoy&#x27;s &quot;The George Wallington Trio&quot; paired four tracks from his 1949 session with several tracks from a trio session with Russell and Max Roach in November 1951. Critic Jim Todd praised Wallington&#x27;s early work as &quot;some of the finest piano that bebop has to offer,&quot; and in particular highlighted his trio work as showing his most confident playing from the period.

In 1952, baritone saxophonist Mulligan formed a jazz group in Los Angeles, California with young trumpet player Chet Baker. Mulligan invited Wallington to join the group as pianist, but he declined. The Mulligan-Baker Quartet as a result became one of the first piano-less jazz quartets and led to fame for both of the horn players.

Wallington continued to record with his trio in 1952, but switched to the Prestige label. A September session included Charles Mingus on bass as &quot;Baron Fingus&quot; and Roach on drums. Chuck Wayne joined the group for one track on mandola. In addition to continuing to record trio sessions for Prestige, Wallington in 1953 joined the Swedish All Stars under the arrangement of Quincy Jones and completed a recording session in late September in Paris with Pierre Michelot on bass and Jean-Louis Viale on drums. Wallington toured Europe with Lionel Hampton&#x27;s big band in 1953. He and Annie Ross, however, left the band early following hecklers and boos at some of Hampton&#x27;s concerts.

In 1954, Wallington formed his own ensemble in New York. Again working with arranger Quincy Jones, his ensemble&#x27;s first recording session in May included trumpeter Dave Burns, trombonist Jimmy Cleveland, tenor saxophonist Frank Foster, and multi-instrumentalist Danny Bank on baritone saxophone and flute. The music from this session was released on the emerging Blue Note label. Two sessions later in the year for Norgran Records included a trio and strings, respectively, and presented another opportunity for Wallington to test the right instrumentation and stylistic approach for a permanent ensemble.

Wallington was given &quot;DownBeat&quot;&#x27;s blindfold test for its February 23, 1955, issue. Presented with records by Jutta Hipp, Kenny Dorham, Ruby Braff, Art Tatum, and Mary Lou Williams, he singled out Bud Powell, Oscar Peterson, and Thelonious Monk for praise. He described Powell, after hearing a recording of the pianist playing &quot;Glass Enclosure,&quot; as the most artistic of the pianists he heard during the test.

Wallington&#x27;s live performance at the Café Bohemia in September 1955, &quot;Live! at Cafe Bohemia&quot;, saw the pianist settle on a quintet format as his permanent group. The first iteration of this group included Donald Byrd, Jackie McLean, Wallington, Paul Chambers, and Art Taylor. Byrd and McLean were &quot;up-and-coming sidemen&quot; at the time, and McLean, who was heavily influenced by Parker early in his career, was developing his own niche within the bop style. Wallington substituted McLean for Phil Woods and Chambers for Teddy Kotick and took his reformed quintet to the famous Van Gelder Studio to record &quot;Jazz for the Carriage Trade&quot; in January 1956.

1957 was the last year Wallington led a recording date before his semi-retirement in 1960. During several sessions that year, he was joined by Nick Stabulas, J. R. Monterose, Jerry Lloyd, and Knobby Totah. After some hard bop recordings during the mid-1950s, Wallington&#x27;s last album from the period, &quot;Dance of the Infidels&quot;, returned to bebop.

=== 1960–1993: Retirement and comeback ===
In 1960, Wallington stopped playing music and moved to Florida to work in the family air conditioning business, citing the stress of endless touring. With more free time after ending his musical career, he took up skeet shooting and became an expert in the sport.

He returned to music in 1984 and recorded three albums, &quot;Virtuoso&quot; in 1984, &quot;Symphony of a Jazz Piano&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Pleasure of a Jazz Inspiration&quot; in 1992. He also performed at the 1985 Kool Jazz Festival in New York.

Wallington died on February 15, 1993, at Weill Cornell Medical Center, then known as New York Hospital, in New York City.

== Musical style ==
Described by Cook and Morton&#x27;s &quot;Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; as &quot;the underrated master of bebop piano,&quot; his speed was called &quot;breathtaking,&quot; and &quot;his melodies unspooling in long, unbroken lines.&quot; His later quintet work has been classified as &quot;somewhere amongst Art Blakey&#x27;s early Jazz Messengers, Hank Mobley, Sonny Stitt, Johnny Griffin, and ... mid-&#x27;50s Mingus.&quot;

Wallington has been compared to fellow jazz pianists Al Haig, Bud Powell, and Dodo Marmarosa. His career has been noted as remarkably similar to that of Marmarosa, another Italian jazz pianist who was critical to bebop&#x27;s development but who retired from public life in the relatively early stages of his career. Wallington himself cited Haig, Bud Powell, and Mel Powell as &quot;his favorite contemporaries,&quot; and was particularly influenced by Earl Hines, Count Basie, and Art Tatum.

<doc id="877020" wikidata="Q533336" url="?curid=877020" title="Unity (ISS module)">
<text>Unity, also known as Node 1, is the first U.S.-built component of the International Space Station (ISS). This cylindrical module, constructed of steel by Boeing for NASA, serves as the critical link between the orbiting laboratory&#x27;s Russian Orbital Segment and US Orbital Segment.

&quot;Unity&quot; was launched on 4 December 1998, aboard the on STS-88. Two days later it was berthed to the previously launched &quot;Zarya&quot; module, marking the first connection between ISS components. Its six Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) locations (forward, aft, port, starboard, zenith, and nadir) facilitate connections to other modules. At launch, two CBM locations were fitted with Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA), one of which enabled the mating with &quot;Zarya&quot;.

Measuring in diameter and in length, &quot;Unity&quot; was built at NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center. It is the first of three connecting modules, joined by &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Tranquility&quot;.

== Launch and initial berthing ==
&quot;Unity&quot; (with its two attached PMAs) was carried into orbit as the primary cargo of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; (OV 105) on STS-88, the first Space Shuttle mission dedicated to assembly of the station. On 6 December 1998, the STS-88 crew mated the docking port of the PMA on the aft berthing port of &quot;Unity&quot; with the forward hatch of the already orbiting &quot;Zarya&quot; module. (&quot;Zarya&quot; was a mixed Russian-U.S. funded and Russian-built component launched a few days before aboard a Russian Proton launch vehicle from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.) This was the first connection made between two station modules.

== Connecting modules and visiting vehicles ==
&quot;Unity&quot; has two axial and four radial Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) ports. In addition to connecting to the &quot;Zarya&quot; module, &quot;Unity&quot; connects to the U.S. &quot;Destiny&quot; Laboratory Module (added on STS-98), the Z1 truss (an early exterior framework for the station added on STS-92), the PMA-3 (also added on STS-92), and the &quot;Quest&quot; Joint Airlock (added on STS-104). During STS-120 the &quot;Harmony&quot; module was temporarily berthed to the port-side hatch of &quot;Unity&quot;. &quot;Tranquility&quot;, with its multi-windowed cupola, was attached to &quot;Unity&quot;&#x27;s port side during the STS-130 mission, and &quot;Leonardo&quot; was added to the nadir hatch during STS-133.

In addition, the &quot;Leonardo&quot; and &quot;Raffaello&quot; Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules were each berthed to &quot;Unity&quot; on multiple missions.

== Details ==
Essential space station resources such as fluids, environmental control and life support systems, electrical and data systems are routed through &quot;Unity&quot; to supply work and living areas of the station. More than 50,000 mechanical items, 216 lines to carry fluids and gases, and 121 internal and external electrical cables using six miles of wire were installed in the &quot;Unity&quot; node. The primary structure of Unity is constructed of aluminium. 

During the space station construction, a crew member placed two speed limit signs on the hatch (leading into the FGB) in 2003, noting the orbital velocity in mph and km/h.

Prior to its launch aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot;, conical Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs) were attached to the aft and forward berthing mechanisms of &quot;Unity&quot;. &quot;Unity&quot; and the two mating adapters together weighed about . The adapters allow the docking systems used by the Space Shuttle and by Russian modules to attach to the node&#x27;s hatches and berthing mechanisms. PMA-1 now permanently attaches &quot;Unity&quot; to &quot;Zarya&quot;, while PMA-2 provided a Shuttle docking port. Attached to the exterior of PMA-1 are computers, or multiplexer-demultiplexers (MDMs), which provided early command and control of &quot;Unity&quot;. &quot;Unity&quot; also is outfitted with an early communications system that allows data, voice and low data rate video with Mission Control Houston, to supplement Russian communications systems during the early station assembly activities. PMA-3 was attached to &quot;Unity&quot;″s nadir berthing mechanism by the crew of STS-92.

== Other nodes ==
The two remaining station connecting modules, or nodes, were manufactured in Italy by Alenia Aerospazio, as part of an agreement between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). &quot;Harmony&quot; (also known as Node 2) and &quot;Tranquility&quot; (also known as Node 3) are slightly longer than &quot;Unity&quot;, measuring almost long in total. In addition to their six berthing ports, each can hold eight International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs). Unity, in comparison, holds just four ISPRs. ESA built Nodes 2 and 3 as partial payment for the launch aboard the Shuttle of the &quot;Columbus&quot; laboratory module, and other ESA equipment.

<doc id="877023" wikidata="Q862803" url="?curid=877023" title="Man'yōgana">
<text>is an ancient writing system that uses Chinese characters to represent the Japanese language. It was the first known kana system to be developed as a means to represent the Japanese language phonetically. The date of the earliest usage of this type of kana is not clear, but it was in use since at least the mid-7th century. The name &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; derives from the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, a Japanese poetry anthology from the Nara period written with &quot;man&#x27;yōgana.&quot;

Texts using the system also often use Chinese characters for their meaning, but &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; refers to such characters only when they are used to represent a phonetic value. The values were derived from the contemporary Chinese pronunciation, but native Japanese readings of the character were also sometimes used. For example, (whose character means &#x27;tree&#x27;) could represent (based on Middle Chinese ), , or (meaning &#x27;tree&#x27; in Old Japanese).

Simplified versions of &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; eventually gave rise to both the hiragana and katakana scripts, which are used in Modern Japanese.

== Origin ==

Scholars from the Korean kingdom of Baekje are believed to have introduced the &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; writing system to the Japanese archipelago. The chronicles &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; both state so; though direct evidence is hard to come by, scholars tend to accept the idea.

A possible oldest example of &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; is the iron Inariyama Sword, which was excavated at the Inariyama Kofun in 1968. In 1978, X-ray analysis revealed a gold-inlaid inscription consisting of at least 115 Chinese characters, and this text, written in Chinese, included Japanese personal names, which were written for names in a phonetic language. This sword is thought to have been made in the year (471 AD in the commonly-accepted theory).

There is a strong possibility that the inscription of the Inariyama Sword may be written in a version of the Chinese language used in Baekje.

==Principles==

&quot;Man&#x27;yōgana&quot; uses kanji characters for their phonetic rather than semantic qualities. In other words, kanji are used for their sounds, not their meanings. There was no standard system for choice of kanji, and different ones could be used to represent the same sound, with the choice made on the whims of the writer. By the end of the 8th century, 970 kanji were in use to represent the 90 morae of Japanese. For example, the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; poem 17/4025 was written as follows:

In the poem, the sounds &quot;mo&quot; () and &quot;shi&quot; () are written with multiple, different characters. All particles and most words are represented phonetically ( &quot;tada&quot;, &quot;asa&quot;), but the words &quot;ji&quot; (), &quot;umi&quot; () and &quot;funekaji&quot; () are rendered semantically.

In some cases, specific syllables in particular words are consistently represented by specific characters. That usage is known as Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai and usage has led historical linguists to conclude that certain disparate sounds in Old Japanese, consistently represented by differing sets of &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; characters, may have merged since then.

==Types==
In writing which utilizes &quot;man&#x27;yōgana,&quot; kanji are mapped to sounds in a number of different ways, some of which are straightforward and others which are less so.

&quot;Shakuon kana&quot; () are based on a Sino-Japanese on&#x27;yomi reading, in which one character represents either one mora or two morae.
&quot;Shakkun kana&quot; () are based on a native kun&#x27;yomi reading, one to three characters represent one to three morae.

== Development ==
Due to the major differences between the Japanese language (which was polysyllabic) and the Chinese language (which was monosyllabic) from which kanji came, &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; proved to be very cumbersome to read and write. As stated earlier, since kanji has two different sets of pronunciation, one based on Sino-Japanese pronunciation and the other on native Japanese pronunciation, it was difficult to determine whether a certain character was used to represent its pronunciation or its meaning, i.e., whether it was &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; or actual kanji, or both.
To alleviate the confusion and to save time writing, kanji that were used as &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; eventually gave rise to hiragana, including the now-obsolete alternatives, alongside a separate system that became katakana. Hiragana developed from &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; written in the highly cursive style popularly used by women; meanwhile, katakana was developed by Buddhist monks as a form of shorthand, utilizing, in most cases, only fragments (for example, usually the first or last few strokes) of &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; characters. In some cases, one &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; character for a given syllable gave rise to a hentaigana that was simplified further to result in the current hiragana character, while a different &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; character was the source for the current katakana equivalent. For example, the hiragana is derived from the &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; , whereas the katakana is derived from the &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; . The multiple alternative hiragana forms for a single syllable were ultimately standardized in 1900, and the rejected variants are now known as hentaigana.

&quot;Man&#x27;yōgana&quot; continues to appear in some regional names of present-day Japan, especially in Kyūshū. A phenomenon similar to &quot;man&#x27;yōgana,&quot; called , still occurs, where words (including loanwords) are spelled out using kanji for their phonetic value. Examples include , , and .

<text>Eryngium maritimum, the sea holly or sea eryngo, or sea eryngium, is a perennial species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae and native to most European coastlines. It resembles a thistle in appearance because of its burr-shaped inflorescences. Despite its common name, it is not a true holly but an umbellifer.

==Etymology==
&quot;E. maritimum&quot; was formally described by Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum I: 233 (1753). The generic name &quot;Eryngium&quot; derives from Greek and may have developed from a description of the plant by Theophrastus (300 BC), who referred to it as &quot;Eryngion&quot;, meaning a spiny plant. Alternatively, the name may have derived from the Greek word &quot;eruggarein&quot;, meaning to eructate (belch), since the plant was used to treat various digestive disorders such as trapped gases.

The specific epithet &quot;maritimum&quot; means &quot;of the sea&quot;.

The common English name appears to date from the 16th century. In his 1548 publication &quot;The Names of Herbes&quot;, the naturalist William Turner stated that &quot;Eryngium is named in englishe sea Hulver or sea Holly&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Although hybrids of &quot;E. maritimum&quot; have been reported, they are relatively few. For example, records have been made of a hybrid between &quot;E. maritimum&quot; and &quot;E. campestre&quot; (=&quot;Eryngium&quot; x &quot;rocheri&quot; Corb. ex Guétrot) in France, and in the region of Valencia, Spain.

The species&#x27; chromosome number is 2n = 16.

==Description==

Sea holly is a glabrous, intensely glaucous, clump-forming perennial that typically reaches a height of approximately 60 cm. It is a succulent xerophyte with a deep, well-developed root system and waxy leaf cuticle. The leaves are stiff, spiny, and leathery in texture. The basal leaves, which measure 5 – 15 cm in length and are rolled when young, are palmately 3-lobed and suborbicular, truncate, or cordate at the base. The stem leaves are similar, but are smaller, sessile, and palmate. All leaves are characterised by thick margins, often with purplish veins, and the presence of stomata on both sides. The petiole is channelled and dilated at the base.

The cotyledons are abruptly contracted into a petiole.

The flowers are bluish white and measure 8mm across, in 1.5 – 2.5 cm heads The bracts are spiny, and the bracteoles are longer than the flowers. The sepals measure 4 – 5 mm and are longer than the petals. 

The flowers are attractive to butterflies. It flowers June to September.

The fruit is 13 – 15 mm, more or less uncompressed and covered in stigmatic papillae which become longer towards the apex. The styles are about 6 mm long, divergent to somewhat recurved.

==Identification==

Apart from the context of its specific coastal habitat, sea holly may also be distinguished from its congeners by the deeper, strongly spiny teeth on the basal leaves and stem leaves.

==Distribution==

Throughout its range, sea holly is a coastal species, occurring locally and almost continuously along the coastlines of England and Ireland. In Great Britain, it is most abundant on the south and west coasts. However, it has largely become extinct from the coasts of northeast England and Scotland. Nevertheless, it may have once been more common and widespread there. It was formerly extant in Shetland, but it never properly established itself at the northernmost limit of its native range. The last documented occurrence in Shetland was at Fitful Head in 1884, where the plant is presumed to have been widespread on the sands of the Bay of Quendale.

In Europe and adjacent parts of northern Africa and the Middle East, the plant has a wide native distribution. In these regions, it occurs on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas as well as the Black and Azov Seas. The distribution also extends northwards into Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, along the Skagerrak and the Swedish islands of Gotland and Öland. The Scandinavian distribution is relatively southerly, extending only as far north as southern Norway and Sweden.

Sea holly has been introduced to parts of eastern North America, where it was once valued as an ornamental plant for coastal restoration. It has also been introduced to Australia with the planting of marram grass.

==Habitat and ecology==

Sea holly grows characteristically on the well-drained substrates of sand dunes and shingles, and is restricted to regions with mild winters. More rarely, it can be found growing on rocky coasts with patches of sand interspersed between artificial hard coastal protection features with a similar structure to shingle. In northern Britain, its distribution is limited by the lack of suitable dune systems on which to grow It withstands the harsh environmental conditions typical of beaches and coastal dune habitats worldwide; namely low soil nutrient levels, frost, strong salty winds, high temperatures and insolation, and periodic sand burial. 

Sea holly is associated with various shingle and strandline communities, where it may be scattered within the vegetation. On shingles, sea holly occurs within Honckenya peploides-Cakile maritima strandline community above the tidal limit On dunes, sea holly may be found growing in the Elymus farctus ssp. boreali-atlanticus foredune community, the pioneer vegetation on foredunes, with &quot;Elytrigia juncea&quot; (E. farctus) as a dominant species.

Sea holly is a poor ecological competitor that generally thrives in open areas, declining when habitats are invaded by shrubby species such as &quot;Rosa rugosa&quot;, &quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot;, &quot;Elaeagnus commutata&quot; and &quot;Salix repens&quot; due to substantial shading effects This is because sea holly is a light-demanding plant, although it is protected against water stress through excessive insolation thanks to its succulent equifacial leaves.

Sea holly has deep, well-developed taproots for water storage, allowing the plant to survive long dry periods that may occur in its habitat. The root system also shows a high degree of plasticity in response to the dynamics of coastal ecosystems and may consequently develop a rhizome-like structure. For example, in response to permanent sand burial, the root internodes gradually lengthen in such a way that the perennating buds are brought closer to the ground surface for ensuring the plants&#x27; survival throughout the growing seasons.
==Status==

Despite a widespread native European distribution, populations of this species have declined significantly in the northern parts of its range, with some of these already having become extinct. It is now threatened or endangered in most European countries and included in endangered plant lists and Red Data Books of several of these countries In Britain, its historic decline may be at least partly attributable to being dug up from the wild on account of its popularity as an ornamental plant in gardens on dry soils.

==In culture, use and relationship with humans==

Like other species in the genus, &quot;E. maritimum&quot; has been traditionally consumed to combat various ailments, especially thanks to the plant&#x27;s high antioxidant activity and content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. It has been utilised for its diuretic, stimulant, cystotonic, stone inhibitor, aphrodisiac, expectorant and anthelmintic properties. Moreover, essential oils, extracted by hydro-distillation, from the aerial parts of the plant have been found to contain oxygenated sesquiterpenes with antimicrobial activity against &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;.

The roots of &quot;E. maritimum&quot; were formerly candied as a sweetmeat and recommended by Dioscorides as a remedy for flatulence. The young shoots may also be eaten like asparagus.

Sea holly has often been represented in paintings and other artwork, such as in works by Irish artist Patrick O&#x27;Hara and on postage stamp prints such as the 1967 one-franc stamp in Belgium, and the 25-pfennig stamp in Germany The plant has also been mentioned in various plays and poems, most notably in the Merry Wives of Windsor by Shakespeare and in the Italian Journey by Goethe.

They are named in a speech by Falstaff: 
Sea holly was nominated the 2002 County flower for the city of Liverpool. Asteroid 199194 Calcatreppola was named after this plant. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 25 September 2018 ().

<text>April Fool is the codename for the spy and double agent who allegedly played a key role in the downfall of the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

==Overview==
According to General Tommy Franks, the American commander in the 2003 Iraq conflict, April Fool, an American officer working undercover as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi intelligence agent. April Fool sold to the Iraqi false &quot;top secret&quot; invasion plans provided by Franks&#x27; team. This deception successfully misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in northern and western Iraq in anticipation of attacks via Turkey or Jordan which never took place. This greatly reduced the defensive capacity in the rest of Iraq and significantly facilitated the actual attacks via Kuwait and the Persian Gulf in the southeast. Inadequately defended, Baghdad fell to coalition forces within a few weeks and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime collapsed.

<text>The Destiny module, also known as the U.S. Lab, is the primary operating facility for U.S. research payloads aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It was berthed to the forward port of the &quot;Unity&quot; module and activated over a period of five days in February, 2001. &quot;Destiny&quot; is NASA&#x27;s first permanent operating orbital research station since Skylab was vacated in February 1974.

The Boeing Company began construction of the research laboratory in 1995 at the Michoud Assembly Facility and then the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. &quot;Destiny&quot; was shipped to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in 1998, and was turned over to NASA for pre-launch preparations in August 2000. It launched on February 7, 2001 aboard the on STS-98.

Astronauts work inside the pressurized facility to conduct research in numerous scientific fields. Scientists throughout the world would use the results to enhance their studies in medicine, engineering, biotechnology, physics, materials science, and Earth science.

==Launch and installation==

Destiny was launched to ISS aboard the Space Shuttle mission STS-98. It launched into Earth orbit on February 7, 2001 aboard the . On February 10, 2001 at 9:50 am CST, the installation of Destiny began. First, the Shuttle SRMSS (Canadarm) was used to remove Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 (PMA 2) from Unity node&#x27;s forward port to make room for the new module. PMA-2 was temporarily stowed on the forward berthing ring of the Z1 truss. &quot;Destiny&quot; was &quot;grabbed&quot; by the robotic arm at 11:23, lifted out of &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ cargo bay, and berthed to the forward port of &quot;Unity&quot;. Two days later, PMA-2 was moved to its semi-permanent location on the forward port of &quot;Destiny&quot;. Several years later, on November 14, 2007, the &quot;Harmony&quot; module was attached to the forward port of the &quot;Destiny&quot; laboratory, and PMA 2 was again relocated to the forward port of &quot;Harmony&quot;.

The addition of &quot;Destiny&quot; increased the habitable volume by 3,800 cubic feet, an increase of 41 percent. 
== Laboratory structure ==

The U.S. laboratory module is long and wide. It is made from aluminum and stainless steel, and comprises three cylindrical sections and two endcones that contain the hatch openings through which astronauts enter and exit the module. The aft port of &quot;Destiny&quot; is connected to the forward port of Unity, and the forward port of &quot;Destiny&quot; is connected to the aft port of &quot;Harmony&quot;. The ends are colored blue and white respectively for the crew to navigate easily. A -diameter window is located on one side of the center module segment.

Each of the two berthing ports on &quot;Destiny&quot; contains a hatch. Both hatches are normally open, and remain open unless a situation arises requiring a module to be isolated. Each hatch has a window. The hatches can be opened or closed from either side. The hatches have a pressure interlock feature, which prevents the hatch from being opened if there is a negative pressure across the hatch (higher pressure on the outside of the hatch). The hatch openings are a square-like six sided shape - which is associated to that module.

&quot;Destiny&quot; has a optically pure, telescope-quality glass window located in an open rack bay used primarily for Earth science observations. Station crewmembers use very high quality video and still cameras at the window to record Earth&#x27;s changing landscapes. A window shutter protects the window from potential micrometeoroid and orbital debris strikes during the life of the ISS. The crew manually opens the shutter to use the window.

Imagery captured from &quot;Destiny&quot;″s window has given geologists and meteorologists the chance to study floods, avalanches, fires and ocean events such as plankton blooms in a way never seen before, as well as given international scientists the opportunity to study features such as glaciers, coral reefs, urban growth and wild fires.

==Equipment==
As with the European and Japanese laboratories of the station, payloads inside &quot;Destiny&quot; are configured around International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs), that can be removed or reconfigured for various experiments and equipment. Made out of a graphite composite shell, each rack weighs about , and is about high, and wide. The eight rack bays are equipped with curtains that provide around of temporary stowage space when not occupied by experiments.

&quot;Destiny&quot; arrived at the station pre-configured with five racks housing electrical and life support systems that provide electrical power, cooling water, air revitalization, and temperature and humidity control. Seven additional racks were flown to &quot;Destiny&quot; in the &quot;Leonardo&quot; Multi-Purpose Logistics Module by STS-102, and ten more were delivered on subsequent missions. &quot;Destiny&quot; can hold up to 13 payload racks with experiments in human life science, materials research, Earth observations and commercial applications. The laboratory has a total of 24 racks inside the laboratory, six on each side.

Internal to the laboratory are racks, rack stand-offs, and vestibule jumpers. The lab racks house the system hardware in removable modular units. The stand-offs provide space for electrical connections, data management systems cabling for computers, air conditioning ducts, thermal control tubes and more, all of which support the space station&#x27;s equipment racks. The racks interface to the piping and wiring in the standoff via outlets and ports located in the standoffs at the base end of each rack location.

Jumpers in the vestibule, the area between &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Destiny&quot;, connect the piping and wiring between the two. Grounding straps between &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Destiny&quot; will be installed. One side of the grounding strap will be connected to the Active Common Berthing Mechanism (ACBM) on &quot;Unity&quot;, while the other end will be connected to the Passive Common Berthing Mechanism (PCBM) on &quot;Destiny&quot;.

Some of the mechanisms on &quot;Destiny&quot; are the CBMs (passive and active), hatches, and the laboratory window shutter. The ACBM is in the forward port of the laboratory. It is attached to the &quot;Harmony&quot; node. The PCBM on &quot;Destiny&quot; is located in the laboratory&#x27;s aft port. The ACBM in &quot;Unity&#x27;s&quot; forward port is latched to the laboratory&#x27;s PCBM to berth &quot;Destiny&quot; to &quot;Unity&quot;.

===Science equipment===

&quot;Destiny&quot; also contains the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), transported to the Space Station on STS-121. The freezer is used both to store samples and reagents on the station, and to transport them to and from the space station in a temperature controlled environment.

Currently installed at the main observation window of &quot;Destiny&quot; is the Agricultural Camera (AgCam). It is a multi-spectral imaging system built and primarily operated by students and faculty at the University of North Dakota. Its purpose is to take frequent images, in visible and infrared light, of vegetated areas on the Earth and promises to deliver a greater effectiveness for in-season agriculture applications research and operational decision support than current satellite systems such as Landsat.

==&quot;Veggie&quot;==

In 2016 the ISS crew operated Veg-03 experiment. In November they harvested a crop of edible romaine lettuce which contributed to the crew&#x27;s meal. Also samples of cabbage are returned to Earth for testing as part of the experiment. This uses the &quot;Veggie&quot; experiment module in &quot;Destiny&quot;, which can provide light and nutrients for plant growth experiments.

==&quot;Destiny&quot; nadir window==

The nadir window is formally known as the &quot;U.S. Laboratory Science Window&quot;, has the &quot;...highest quality optics ever flown on a human occupied spacecraft...&quot;, according to NASA, and can support taking Earth observations/images. In 2010 a research facility was brought to the station, called WORF, and the first photo with it was taken in January 2011. WORF was delivered by ISS Flight 19A (which was STS-131) .

===WORF===
In 2010 the WORF was brought to ISS aboard STS-131 and installed. This is a facility that uses the &quot;Destiny&quot; nadir window to support various types of photography and observation. WORF, which stands for Window Observational Research Facility is constructed based on International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) and EXPRESS Rack program technology. The first photo taken by WORF was on January 21, 2011 with Ag Cam.

The name WORF is an allusion to Worf, the fictional character of the same name who appeared in the science fiction television and film franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. A special mission patch for WORF was issued that featured text written in the Klingon language. Another cross-over of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise and space exploration was the naming of Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

A similar window is Nauka module&#x27;s porthole window.

==In media==
* The module &quot;Destiny&quot; is featured in the 2013 film &quot;Gravity&quot;.
* The module, identified as &quot;the 2001 module &quot;Destiny&quot;&quot;, was originally intended to be the small section of Alpha (the future name of the ISS) used as a throne at the end of the 2017 film &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot; and covers this role in the novelization, but, in the final shooting of the film, it was replaced by the Apollo command and service module &quot;Destiny 2005&quot;, modified with artificial gravity and a speakerphone-like radio system.

<doc id="877034" wikidata="Q1757751" url="?curid=877034" title="Rocketship X-M">
<text>Rocketship X-M (a.k.a. Expedition Moon and originally Rocketship Expedition Moon) is a 1950 American black-and-white science fiction film from Lippert Pictures, the first outer space adventure of the post-World War II era. The film was produced and directed by Kurt Neumann and stars Lloyd Bridges, Osa Massen, John Emery, Noah Beery Jr., Hugh O&#x27;Brian, and Morris Ankrum.

&quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; tells the story of a Moon expedition gone awry. Through a series of unforeseen events, the expedition&#x27;s crew find themselves on the infamous red planet, Mars. During their time on the planet they go on to discover the remnants of a Martian civilization destroyed long ago by atomic war and now reverted to barbarism.
==Plot==

Four men and a woman blast into outer space from the White Sands Proving Ground aboard the RX-M (Rocketship Expedition-Moon) on humanity&#x27;s first expedition to the Moon. Halfway there, after surviving their jettisoned and runaway first stage and a meteoroid storm, their engines suddenly quit. Recalculating fuel ratios and swapping around their multiple, different fuels corrects the problem, supposedly allowing continuing to the Moon. When the engines are reignited, the RX-M careens out of control on a rapid heading beyond the Moon. The increased acceleration causes the crew pass out. Reviving days later, they quickly discover that they have traveled some 50,000,000 miles; the RX-M is now just 50,000 miles away from Mars. Dr. Karl Eckstrom is forced to &quot;pause and observe respectfully while something infinitely greater assumes control&quot;.

[ At this point the film changes from black and white to tinted red ]

The RX-M safely passes through the Martian atmosphere and lands. The next morning the crew, clad in aviation oxygen masks due to the low oxygen levels, begin exploring the desolate surface. They come across physical evidence of a now dead advanced Martian civilization: a partially buried-in-the-sand, stylized, Art Deco (or Tiki culture) like metal face sculpture and in the distance Moderne architecture-like ruins. Their Geiger counter registers dangerous radiation levels, keeping them well away. These dangerous levels make it clear that there was once an atomic war on Mars in the distant past.

Finding cave refuge, the crew notice in the distance the primitive human descendants of that civilization emerging from behind boulders and creeping toward them. Amazed, Dr. Eckstrom comments &quot;From Atomic Age to Stone Age&quot;. Soon after leaving, two of the explorers encounter a dark-haired woman who has lost her footing and rolled down a hill toward them; she is blind, with thick, milky cataracts on both eyes. She screams upon hearing their oxygen mask-distorted voices. The radiation burned tribesmen attack, throwing large rocks and stone axes. Armed with only a revolver and a bolt-action rifle, the explorers defend themselves, purposely missing the primitives. Major Corrigan is killed by a large rock thrown by the primitives. Moments later, Dr. Eckstrom is killed by a stone axe. Navigator Chamberlain is badly injured by a large thrown rock. Colonel Graham, Dr. Van Horn, and Chamberlain finally make their way back to the ship.

[ At this point the film changes from tinted red to black and white ]

As the RX-M nears Earth, the three survivors (Graham, Van Horn, with the unconscious Chamberlain) calculate that they have no fuel to make a landing. Col. Graham contacts their base and reports their dire status to Dr. Fleming, who listens intently and wordlessly over headphones. Col. Graham&#x27;s report is not heard, but Fleming&#x27;s subtle reactions tells of the crew&#x27;s odyssey, their discovery of a once advanced civilization destroyed long ago by atomic war, and of the crew fatalities at the hands of Martian descendants reverted to barbarism.

Col. Graham and Dr. Van Horn embrace as the RX-M begins its uncontrolled descent, consoling one another in the moments left to them. Through a porthole, they bravely watch their rapid descent into the wilds of Nova Scotia. The press is later informed by a shaken Dr. Fleming that the entire crew has perished. When they ask if the mission was a failure, he confidently responds with conviction, stating that all theories about crewed spaceflight and exploration have now been proven. He continues, underscoring the point that a dire warning has been received from the crew that could very well mean the salvation of humanity, &quot;A new spaceship, the RX-M-2, begins construction tomorrow&quot;. The pioneering exploration continues.

==Film score==
The evocative soundtrack was written by American composer Ferde Grofé (composer of Grand Canyon Suite), who used a theremin in portions of the score. This was the first use of an electronic musical instrument in a science fiction film. The theremin would later become strongly identified with the genre in the years to come. During the film&#x27;s post-production, Grofé&#x27;s score was conducted by film and TV composer/arranger Albert Glasser. Later on, the soundtrack would have its first release in 1977 on LP (runtime 37:16) from Starlog Records (SR-1000). The album contains a bonus track not used in the film.

The CD version of the soundtrack was released in 2012 and was produced by Monstrous Movie Music (MMM-1965) in an edition limited to 1000 copies. The CD&#x27;s 16-page illustrated booklet contains extensive information about the film score, which includes pages from Grofé&#x27;s original hand-written score and photos related to the film production.

==Production==
Because production issues had delayed the release of George Pal&#x27;s high-profile &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; was quickly shot in just 18 days on a $94,000 budget; it was then rushed into theaters 25 days before the Pal film, while taking full advantage of &quot;Destination Moon&quot;″s high-profile national publicity.

Given the film&#x27;s minimal special effects budget and limited shooting days, the surface of Mars was much easier to simulate using remote Southern California locations than creating the airless and cratered surface of the Moon. The location where the crew exits the spacecraft and begins to explore is Zabriskie Point in Death Valley National Park.

The film&#x27;s original 1950 theatrical release prints had all Mars scenes tinted a pinkish-sepia color. All other scenes are in black-and-white.

The RX-M&#x27;s design was taken from rocket illustrations that appeared in an article in the January 17, 1949 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. The interior structure of the spaceship&#x27;s larger second stage is shown as having a long ladder that the crew must climb; it runs &quot;up&quot; through the RX-M&#x27;s fuel compartment, which has on all sides a series of narrow fuel tanks filled with various propulsion chemicals. By selecting and mixing them together in various proportions, different levels of thrust are attainable from the RX-M&#x27;s engines. The crew ladder ends at a round pressure hatch in the middle of a bulkhead floor that leads to the crew&#x27;s upper living and control compartment. 
Instruments and technical equipment were supplied by Allied Aircraft Company of North Hollywood.

===Historical and factual accuracy===
The five Mars explorers wear U.S. military surplus clothing, including overalls and aviator&#x27;s leather jackets. It has been noted in other film reviews that the explorers are wearing gas masks, but gas masks would include goggles to protect the eyes. Due to the thin Martian atmosphere, the explorers are actually wearing military &quot;Oxygen Breathing Apparatuses&quot; (OBA) like those used by military firefighters.

Various scientific curiosities and errors are seen during the film:

With less than 15 minutes to go until launch, the RX-M&#x27;s crew are still in the midst of a leisurely press conference being held at a base building. From its launch pad, the RX-M blasts straight up, and once it leaves the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the ship makes a hard &quot;90-degree turn&quot; to place the RX-M into Earth orbit. Its speed at an altitude of 360 miles is stated to be ; in fact at that height orbital velocity is (though escape velocity is approximately correctly stated to be ). Simultaneously with that turn, the crew cabin rotates within the RX-M&#x27;s hull, around its lateral axis, so the ship&#x27;s cabin deck is always facing &quot;down&quot;, orienting the audience. Though objects are purposely shown to float free to demonstrate a lack of gravity, none of the five crew members float, apparently unaffected by weightlessness.

The RX-M&#x27;s jettisoned first stage, with its engine still firing, and a later meteoroid storm (inaccurately referred to in dialog as meteorites) both make audible roaring sounds in the soundless vacuum of space that can be heard inside the crew compartment. The clusters of those fast moving meteoroids appear identical in shape and detail (actually, the same prop meteoroids were shot from different angles and positions, then optically printed in tandem, at different sizes, on the film&#x27;s master negative).

A point is made in dialog that the RX-M is carrying more than &quot;double&quot; the amount of rocket fuel and oxygen needed to make a successful round trip and landing on the Moon; while impractical for various reasons, this detail becomes a convenient, then necessary plot device in making the later Mars story line more believable.

Several scenes in &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; involving the interaction between the RX-M&#x27;s sole female crew member, scientist Dr. Lisa Van Horn, her male crew, the launch site staff, and the press corps provide cultural insights into early 1950s sexist attitudes toward women. One notable scene involves Van Horn and expedition leader (and fellow scientist) Dr. Karl Eckstrom rushing to recalculate fuel mixtures after their initial propulsion problems. When they come up with different figures, expedition leader Eckstrom insists they must proceed using his numbers. Van Horn objects to this arbitrary decision, but submits, and Eckstrom forgives her for &quot;momentarily being a woman&quot;. Subsequent events prove Eckstrom&#x27;s &quot;arbitrary decision&quot; to be wrong, placing them all in jeopardy.

Lippert&#x27;s feature was the first film drama to explore the dangers of nuclear warfare and atomic radiation through the lens of science fiction; these became recurrent themes in many 1950s science fiction films that followed. Dalton Trumbo, black-listed during the McCarthy era, script doctored the film&#x27;s Red Planet sequence, adding the horror of an atomic war having occurred on Mars; his name does not appear in the film credits.

==New footage added==
&quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; was rushed to market to be in theaters before the more lavishly produced but delayed &quot;Destination Moon&quot; that was finally released 25 days later. A lack of both time and budget forced &quot;RX-M&quot;″s producers to omit special effects scenes and substitute stock footage of American V-2 rocket launches and flight to complete some sequences that otherwise would have been made using the &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; special effects miniature. These V-2 inserts created very noticeable continuity issues.

In the 1970s the rights to &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; were acquired by Kansas City film exhibitor, movie theater owner (and later video distributor) Wade Williams, who set about having some of &quot;RX-M&quot;″s special effects scenes reshot in order to improve the film&#x27;s overall continuity. The VHS tape, LaserDisc, and DVD releases incorporate this re-shot footage. Williams funded the production of new footage to replace the stock V-2 shots and a few missing scenes. All new footage was produced for Wade Williams Productions by Bob Burns III, his wife Kathy Burns, former Disney designer/artist Tom Scherman, Academy Award winner Dennis Muren, Emmy Award nominee Michael Minor, and Academy Award winner Robert Skotak. Costumes were re-made that closely replicated those worn by the film&#x27;s explorers, and a new, screen accurate Rocketship X-M effects miniature was built.

The new replacement shots consist of the RX-M flying through space; it landing tail first on the Red Planet; a different shot of the crew heading away from the RX-M to explore the stark Martian surface; the surviving explorers quickly returning to their nearby spaceship, and the RX-M later blasting off from Mars into space. These six replacement shots were filmed near Los Angeles in color, then converted to black-and-white and re-tinted where necessary to match the original film footage. (Unlike the DVD release, the earlier LaserdDisc of &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; contains extra bonus material documenting the making of the film and the creation of this new footage.) The film&#x27;s production and the making of these new scenes were also presented in &quot;RX-M&quot; feature articles in both &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine and later expanded in the first issue (1979) of &quot;Starlog&quot;″s spin-off magazine &quot;CineMagic&quot;. Prints of the original theatrical release version of &quot;RX-M&quot; are still stored in Williams&#x27; Kansas City film vaults. They have not been converted to a home video format.

Image&#x27;s 50th Anniversary DVD release (2000), under license from Williams, is oddly missing two of his re-filmed Mars scenes: Lippert&#x27;s original matte painting scene, which has tiny matted-in figures leaving an obviously painted RX-M, is retained instead of the Williams&#x27; re-shot replacement scene that has the five explorers heading away from a convincing RX-M effects miniature standing on a barren Martian plain. A new bridging scene, set at the end of the Mars sequence, showing the surviving explorers hurriedly returning to the RX-M, is also missing from Image&#x27;s DVD.

==Award nomination==
Retro Hugo Award: &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; was nominated in 2001 for the 1951 Retro Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, being one of the science fiction films eligible during calendar year 1950, exactly 50 years after the film&#x27;s first release. (50 years, 75 years, or 100 years prior is the eligibility requirement governing the awarding of Retro Hugos.)

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==
The film was featured in the second cable season premiere episode of the cult film-lampooning television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; stands as an important episode in that show&#x27;s history, showcasing iconic set redesigns as well as the introduction of Kevin Murphy and Frank Conniff to their long-running performance roles as Tom Servo and TV&#x27;s Frank, respectively.

<text>Gideon Johnson Pillow (June 8, 1806October 8, 1878) was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army in the Western Theater of the American Civil War, having previously served as a general of United States Volunteers during the Mexican–American War. Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican–American War, where he was wounded at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec and later promoted to major general, even when his superiors were unimpressed with his lack of military knowledge and his tendency to modify battle plans to the detriment of operations. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk&#x27;s assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow.

After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri.

Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary breakthrough of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline.

Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas, in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.

==Early life and education==
Pillow was born on June 8, 1806, in Williamson County, Tennessee, to Gideon Pillow and Ann Payne Pillow.

He came from a well connected, property owning family with a reputation for Indian fighting and loyalty to Andrew Jackson. He graduated from the University of Nashville in 1827 and practiced law in Columbia, Tennessee, where he became friends with future President James K. Polk. Pillow married Mary Elizabeth Martin, March 24, 1831.

In 1831, Tennessee Governor William Carroll, a cousin who had been one of Jackson&#x27;s lieutenants, appointed Pillow as district attorney general. Pillow served as a brigadier general in the Tennessee Militia from 1833 to 1836. Pillow played &quot;an important role&quot; in the 1844 Democratic Party convention which nominated Polk for president, although Pillow exaggerated his contribution to the exclusion of other prominent Polk supporters.

==Early military career==

Carroll appointed Pillow Tennessee&#x27;s adjutant general in 1833, commissioning him a brigadier general. Pillow treated the position as largely ceremonial, the first in a path to higher office he hoped to attain. He stepped down after three years to return to practicing law. He bought the Clifton Place plantation near Columbia, which he eventually developed into one of the largest estates in the state, increasing his political influence. In 1844, he helped James K. Polk secure the Democratic nomination for president, which Polk won. 

==Mexican War==

When the Mexican–American War began shortly afterwards, Polk appointed Pillow brigadier general in the United States Volunteers, largely to keep an eye on Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott, both political rivals of Polk&#x27;s. In Mexico, Pillow&#x27;s superiors, many of them West Point graduates trained as career soldiers, were unimpressed by the minimal training and experience he had despite his high rank, as a citizen soldier. Assigned to Robert Patterson&#x27;s encampment in Lomita, where he commanded the Second Brigade of the Second Division of Tennessee volunteers, one of his first orders canceled daytime guard duty, a popular move with the troops but a potential major security lapse. He also proposed a reorganization of the troops so divisive that Taylor had to personally resolve tensions. In another move that was associated with him for years afterwards, after ordering his troops to dig a ditch around their encampment, had them put the earth on the wrong side of the ditch, making it useless for defensive purposes. William B. Campbell, a colonel in the First Tennessee and later governor of Tennessee, said Pillow&#x27;s was &quot;one of the smallest capacity elevated to so high a command.&quot;

Taylor, who described Pillow as having &quot;much to learn&quot; about military matters, left him and his troops behind when he later marched on Monterrey early in 1847. They saw some minor skirmishes during the Siege of Veracruz. Pillow made another widely noted misstep one night early in the battle when he ordered half of a company of Pennsylvania volunteers to stand guard on one side of a road while the others slept across from them, a formation that would likely have resulted in heavy casualties had the unit been attacked, leading even privates to hold his generalship in low esteem. 
At the Battle of Cerro Gordo, Pillow disregarded orders and chose a more direct route up one of the ridges where the Mexicans under Antonio López de Santa Anna were positioned. His troops had less cover and had to ascend in single file. The Mexicans opened fire upon seeing them, forcing Pillow to attack the wrong position and ruining Scott&#x27;s plan to have Pillow&#x27;s troops serve as a diversionary force for the main U.S. attack. Attempting to get some clarification on how to regroup during the ensuing chaotic retreat, George McClellan found Pillow, his commander, hiding behind a bush in the rear when an errant canister wounded Pillow&#x27;s arm, forcing him to retreat even further for medical attention, where he berated his subordinates for their failure to properly support him. Pillow sent McClellan to ask Scott for reinforcements, which were unavailable. When he returned, the Mexicans on the ridges had surrendered as Santa Anna had abandoned them in his retreat. 

When Pillow returned to Tennessee to heal his arm afterwards, he was harshly criticized by others who had fought under him at Cerro Gordo. He published his own account of the battle, reflecting favorably on him. Pillow was promoted to major general shortly afterwards, primarily because he was to return to Mexico, and Polk wanted him to continue monitoring Scott&#x27;s actions. Pillow believed the promotion was due to the military prowess he had displayed.

Pillow rejoined U.S. forces as they made their final drive towards Mexico City. He again disobeyed superior orders to avoid battle after cutting a road through the lava field at Padierna resulting in the Battle of Contreras. Scott came to the battlefield and found Pillow a mile and a half () from his troops. That evening Pillow admitted to Scott that he had lost track of where his troops were, and Scott ordered Pillow to remain at headquarters the next day while Persifor Frazer Smith led the action that won the battle for the U.S.

For the remainder of the Battle for Mexico City, Pillow began differing with Scott&#x27;s plans. He opposed the attack on Molino del Rey, and after the cannon foundry Scott believed was there turned out not to be, Pillow sent a private letter to Polk questioning Scott&#x27;s judgement. Pillow also resisted his assignment to attack Chapultepec from the west, believing it would expose his troops to higher casualties while letting other commanders take the credit, an objection that held little sway with Scott. Early in the next day&#x27;s fighting, he was wounded in the ankle, putting him out of action for what was effectively the rest of the war. 

During the war he came into conflict with Scott. Pillow refused Scott&#x27;s request that Pillow revise his exaggerated battle reports in which he took credit for the American victories at Contreras and Churubusco. Then, a letter written by Pillow under the pseudonym &quot;Leonidas&quot;, published in the &quot;New Orleans Delta&quot; in September 1847, wrongfully credited Pillow with the victories at Contreras, including the plan of battle and command of all the forces engaged, and Churubusco. When Pillow&#x27;s intrigue was exposed, he was arrested by Scott and held for court-martial for insubordination and violating regulations, along with Colonel James Duncan and Brigadier General William J. Worth.

Pillow wrote to President Polk about Scott&#x27;s involvement in a bribery scheme proposed by Mexican leader Santa Anna for his help in ending the war without further bloodshed. Polk relieved Scott of command by a letter of February 18, 1848. Polk reduced the proceedings against Pillow, Duncan and Worth from a court martial to a court of inquiry which had no criminal implications and added that Pillow could question Scott about the bribery scheme. Polk and Secretary of War William L. Marcy chose the three members of the court for their hostility to Scott.

Proceedings began in March 1848 in Mexico City. Major Archibald W. Burns, a paymaster and Pillow protege, claimed authorship of the &quot;Leonidas&quot; letter, at Pillow&#x27;s behest. When the court of inquiry took as much testimony as they could in Mexico City it reconvened in Frederick, Maryland. Scott left Mexico City the next day. The court reconvened in June with Scott ill. Scott dropped the charges against Worth and Duncan and Pillow was exonerated when the court announced their findings on July 1, 1848. Scott resumed his duties as general-in-chief of the army early that month. While the affair had cost Pillow politically, it benefited Polk by ending Scott&#x27;s presidential aspirations.

Pillow was discharged from the United States Volunteers in July. In early 1849, two other courts of inquiry cleared Pillow of any misconduct during the war. Pillow assisted Roswell S. Ripley in writing &quot;The war with Mexico&quot;.

In his memoirs, Scott wrote that Pillow was &quot;amiable and possessed of some acuteness, but the only person I have ever known who was wholly indifferent in the choice between truth and falsehood, honesty and dishonesty:—ever as ready to attain an end by the one as the other, and habitually boastful of acts of cleverness at the total sacrifice of moral character.&quot;

On the other hand, Pillow&#x27;s friend and patron, President Polk, stated after the court of inquiry was closed: &quot;General Pillow is a gallant and highly meritorious officer, and has been greatly persecuted by General Scott, for no other reason than that he is a Democrat in his politics and was supposed to be my personal and political friend.&quot;

===Interbellum career===

Pillow was a Tennessee delegate to the 1850 Nashville Convention, which met to consider possible courses of action if the federal government decided to ban slavery in territories acquired and organized as part of Westward Expansion and the Mexican–American War. Pillow supported compromise, opposing delegates who favored nullification and secession. He declined to run to succeed Carroll as governor of Tennessee since his time in Mexico had left his business affairs in such disarray that he did not believe himself capable of giving the job his full attention. Instead, he expanded his landholdings into Arkansas and Mississippi.

Pillow&#x27;s antagonism for Scott was reflected in the 1852 election for president, when he opposed Scott and supported Franklin Pierce. Pillow attempted to win the vice presidential nomination, but was not taken seriously, and it went to went to William R. King. He intended to be a candidate for vice president in 1856. Instead, he supported his brother-in-law Aaron V. Brown, who lost that nomination to John C. Breckinridge. 

With sentiment in the South increasingly in favor of secession, Pillow was one of the region&#x27;s few supporters of James Buchanan in 1856. However, Buchanan did not see fit to reward Pillow with a position in his administration following his victory. The following year, Pillow tried unsuccessfully to secure the Democratic nomination for a seat in the United States Senate from Tennessee.

Pillow supported the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas in the presidential election of 1860, despite being publicly critical of the Democratic nominee. With the election of Abraham Lincoln as president, Pillow ultimately came to support secession as the will of the majority in Tennessee, although he remained personally opposed.

Pillow&#x27;s political failures were in contrast to his continuing business success. In addition to his law practice and management of the family farm, Pillow engaged in highly profitable land speculation. By 1860, he was one of the largest landholders in the South and possibly the wealthiest man in Tennessee.

==American Civil War==
Pillow joined the Confederacy just after the start of the American Civil War. Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris appointed Pillow as the senior major general in the Tennessee Militia and commander of the Provisional Army of Tennessee as of May 9, 1861. Green worked closely with Harris to develop a regional munitions industry and to create the structure that would become the Army of Tennessee. In July 1861, he was appointed brigadier general in the Confederate States Army and was given command of the unit that was briefly called the &quot;Army of Liberation&quot;. Pillow felt disrespected by his rank since other veterans of the Mexican War had been commissioned into the Confederate Army with at least the rank they had attained during that conflict; he was oblivious to his low reputation among other veteran officers and believed himself to be a skilled military leader.

Pillow soon came under the command of Major General Leonidas Polk and General Albert Sidney Johnston in the Western Theater. Polk ordered him to lead a force into Kentucky on September 3, 1861, violating Kentucky&#x27;s declared &quot;neutrality&quot; and provoking the State and the majority of its citizens to adhere to the Union.

===Belmont===

Pillow&#x27;s first combat of the war was against Union Army Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, also in his first battle, at Belmont, Missouri, in November. Grant crossed the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, on the night of November 6, 1861, to keep Confederate forces occupied in Missouri while Major General John C. Fremont tried to maintain control of the western part of the state. Grant decided to attack the small Confederate Camp Johnston at Belmont, Missouri across the river from the Confederate fort at Columbus, Kentucky. Pillow, who had left the area with 5,000 men for Clarksville, Tennessee, a few hours earlier, was recalled by Polk to confront the attackers.

Failing to take full advantage of a superior position, Pillow ordered an assault on the Union force through the woods, giving the Union troops cover from which to push back the Confederates. Then the Union troops turned to the camp to pillage and celebrate, which Grant attempted to stop by burning the camp. Pillow, assisted by Brigadier General Benjamin F. Cheatham, reorganized the Confederates and counterattacked. The disorganized Union soldiers fled for their gunboats, leaving the 27th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment behind, only to be rescued by boats sent back for that purpose.

Both sides claimed the battle, seen today as inconclusive, as a victory: the Confederates because the Union force withdrew across the river under fire; Grant because he had achieved both his objectives. The Confederate force of about 5,000 men and the Union force of about 3,100 men suffered about the same number of casualties and the armies returned to their original positions. Nevertheless, Pillow and his command were voted the Thanks of the Confederate Congress on December 6, 1861:

===Fort Donelson===
Pillow resigned from the Army on December 28, 1861, in a dispute with Major General Leonidas Polk, but he soon realized that this was a rash decision and was able to cancel his resignation by obtaining an order from Confederate President Jefferson Davis on February 2, 1862. When he returned, under direct command of General Albert Sidney Johnston rather than under Polk, he was given command at Clarksville, Tennessee. Without permission, Pillow began to forward men and supplies to Fort Donelson, a crucial installation protecting the Cumberland River. On February 9, Pillow was briefly assigned to command at Fort Donelson and began to make improvements. Three additional brigadier generals were assigned to the fort soon thereafter. One, John B. Floyd, former governor of Virginia and Secretary of War under James Buchanan, outranked Pillow, who found himself displaced as commander and put in the unofficial position of second-in-command.

On February 12, 1862, Union forces under the command of Brigadier General Grant began to arrive near Fort Donelson. On the night of February 14, Floyd and his subordinate commanders decided to try to break out of the fort and escape a likely Union siege before the full Union force could arrive. Pillow set forth a plan to surprise the Union force which was accepted. Floyd gave no orders concerning the details of the operations, including the evacuation and order of march, in order to exploit any breakthrough.

As the Battle of Fort Donelson continued into February 15, 1862, under Floyd&#x27;s order, Pillow took control from the general who was in formal command of the left wing of the army, Brigadier General Bushrod Johnson, who continued to ably assist Pillow. Pillow led this wing in a surprise assault with the intention of opening an escape route to relieve the besieged Confederate forces in the fort. Although the assault against the division of Brigadier General John A. McClernand was initially successful, Pillow inexplicably decided to pull his men from their advance positions and back into the trenches so that they could be resupplied before their escape, squandering the advances they had fought for so hard that morning. Floyd and the other generals were furious with Pillow, but it was too late to correct his error, especially because Floyd and Pillow saw Union troop movements and heard false reports about the arrival of substantial Union Army reinforcements. Floyd then panicked and ordered all troops back to their trenches. The Union force then retook the lost ground and the outer defenses of the fort.

At a council of war early on the morning of February 16, the generals agreed to surrender their army. Floyd, who feared prosecution for treason if he should be captured, turned command of the army over to Pillow, who had similar concerns and immediately passed command to Simon Bolivar Buckner, who had argued that the Confederate position was untenable. Believing the garrison could hold out long enough to be evacuated by river transport, Pillow still wanted to fight. He finally agreed with the other generals to surrender the fort and garrison, but not himself personally. Pillow did ask cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was determined to escape with his command, to lead Pillow&#x27;s brigade out as well. Pillow escaped in the night in a small boat across the Cumberland River; Floyd likewise escaped, taking two regiments of his Virginia command with him before Buckner could surrender to Grant. Forrest inquired of Floyd about Pillow&#x27;s whereabouts and was told he had already retreated and Forrest was free to follow his own course.

Some historians have judged Ulysses S. Grant as being too rash in his haste to assault Fort Donelson without possessing overwhelming superiority. However, his acquaintance with Gideon Pillow played a key factor in his confidence. As he wrote in his memoirs,

Grant also recalled that, following the surrender of Fort Donelson, he met with his old friend Buckner, who told him of Pillow&#x27;s escape. At the Confederate council of war the night before, the vain Pillow had expressed concern that his capture would be a disaster for the Southern cause.

&quot;He thought you&#x27;d rather get hold of him than any other man in the Southern Confederacy,&quot; Buckner told Grant.

&quot;Oh,&quot; replied Grant, &quot;if I had got him, I&#x27;d let him go again. He will do us more good commanding you fellows.&quot;

===Reassignment===
Pillow assumed command of the 3rd Division of the Army of Central Kentucky, but was suspended from command by order of Jefferson Davis on April 16 for &quot;grave errors in judgement in the military operations which resulted in the surrender of the army&quot; (at Fort Donelson). Pillow resigned October 21, 1862, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis rescinded the resignation and restored Pillow to command on December 10, 1862. He commanded a brigade in Major General John C. Breckinridge&#x27;s division of the Army of Tennessee, commanded by General Braxton Bragg, during the third day at the Battle of Stones River, January 2, 1863, arriving on the battlefield just an hour before Breckinridge&#x27;s assault. Breckinridge was furious to find Pillow cowering behind a tree and ordered him forward. After the battle, Pillow was one of the few Confederate officers to speak in favor of General Bragg&#x27;s battlefield decisions, denigrating Breckinridge&#x27;s execution of the ill-fated assault.

Pillow commanded the Volunteer and Conscription Bureau of the Army of Tennessee and related recruiting assignments starting January 16, 1863. Although he had no combat assignments after Stones River, he had a short and unsuccessful field command in June 1864 when he was assigned to disrupt Major General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s communications between Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia, during the Atlanta Campaign. After his loss at the Battle of LaFayette, he resumed recruiting assignments, where he served out the remainder of the war. He was the Commissary General of Prisoners for the Confederacy starting in February after the death of Brigadier General John H. Winder. He was captured by Union forces at Union Springs, Alabama, in April, and was paroled in Montgomery the next month. President Andrew Johnson pardoned him in August.

==Later life==
After the American Civil War, Pillow was forced into bankruptcy, but embarked on a successful law practice in Memphis, Tennessee, as partner with former Governor Isham G. Harris. He died October 8, 1878, at age 72 near Helena, Arkansas, in Phillips County, during that year&#x27;s yellow fever epidemic. Initially buried at Helena, Pillow was reinterred in Elmwood Cemetery, Memphis.

==Honors==
Fort Pillow, site of the controversial 1864 battle of Fort Pillow, was named for him.

<text>The Davidic line refers to the descendants of David, who established the House of David ( ) in the Kingdom of Israel and Judah. In Judaism, it is based on texts from the Hebrew Bible, as well as on later Jewish traditions.

According to the biblical narrative, David of the Tribe of Judah engaged in a protracted conflict with Ish-bosheth of the Tribe of Benjamin after the latter succeeded his father Saul to become the second king of an amalgamated Israel and Judah. Amidst this struggle, God had sent his prophet Samuel to anoint David as the true king of the Israelites. Following Ish-bosheth&#x27;s assassination at the hands of his own army captains, David officially acceded to the throne around 1010 BCE, replacing the House of Saul with his own and becoming the country&#x27;s third king. He was succeeded by his son Solomon, whose mother was Bathsheba. Solomon&#x27;s death led to the rejection of the House of David by most of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, with only Judah and Benjamin remaining loyal: the dissenters chose Jeroboam as their monarch and formed the Kingdom of Israel in the north (Samaria); while the loyalists kept Solomon&#x27;s son Rehoboam as their monarch and formed the Kingdom of Judah in the south (Judea). With the success of Jeroboam&#x27;s Revolt having severed Israel&#x27;s connection to the House of David, only the Judahite monarchs, except Athaliah, were part of the Davidic line.

In the aftermath of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem around 587 BCE, Solomon&#x27;s Temple was destroyed and the Kingdom of Judah fell to the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Nearly 450 years later, the Hasmonean dynasty established the first independent Jewish kingdom since the Babylonian conquest, though it was not considered to be connected to the Davidic line nor to the Tribe of Judah.

In Jewish eschatology, the Messiah () will be a Jewish king whose paternal bloodline traces to David. He is expected to rule over the Jewish people during the Messianic Age and in the world to come.

==Historicity==

Very little is conclusively known about the House of David. The Tel Dan Stele mentions the death of the reigning king from &quot;BYTDWD&quot;, (interpreted as &quot;House of David&quot;) and thus far is the only extrabiblical explicit mention of David himself. The stele is dated to circa 840 BCE; however, the name of the Davidic king is not totally preserved, as much of the stele has not survived since the 9th century BCE. All that remains of the name is the final syllable, the extremely common theophoric suffix &quot;-yahū&quot;. Because the stele coincides the death of the Davidic king with the death of [Jeho]ram, the king of the Kingdom of Samaria, scholars have reconstructed the second slain king as Ahaziah of Judah, the only king contemporary to Jehoram with a name ending in &quot;-yahū&quot;.

The earliest unambiguously attested king from the Davidic line is Uzziah, who reigned in the 8th century BCE, about 75 years after Ahaziah, who is named on bullae seals belonging to his servants Abijah and Shubnayahu. Uzziah may also be mentioned in the annals of Tiglath-Pileser III; however, the texts are largely fragmentary. Additionally, a tombstone dated to the Second Temple Period claiming to mark the grave (or, reburial) site of Uzziah, was discovered in a convent on the Mount of Olives in 1931, but there is no way of determining if the remains were genuinely Uzziah&#x27;s as the stone had to have been carved more than 700 years after Uzziah died and was originally interred, and the tablet&#x27;s provenance remains a mystery. A controversial artefact called the Jehoash Tablet recalls deeds performed by Jehoash of Judah, who reigned about 44 years before Uzziah; however, scholars are tensely divided on whether or not the inscription is genuine. After Uzziah, each successive king of Judah is attested to in some form, with the exception of Amon of Judah: Jotham, Uzziah&#x27;s successor, is named on the seals of his own son and successor, Ahaz, who ruled from 732 to 716 BCE. Hezekiah, Ahaz&#x27;s son, is attested to by numerous royal seals and Sennacherib&#x27;s Annals; Manasseh is recorded giving tribute to Esarhaddon; Josiah has no relics explicitly naming him; however, seals belonging to his son Eliashib and officials Nathan-melech and Asaiah have been discovered; and the kings Jehoahaz II, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah are never explicitly named in historical records but are instead alluded to; however, Jeconiah is mentioned by name in Babylonian documents detailing the rations he and his sons were given while held prisoner during the Babylonian captivity.

The origins of the dynasty, on the other hand, are shrouded in mystery. The Tel Dan Stele, as aforementioned, remains the only mention of David himself outside the Bible, and the historical reliability of the United Monarchy of Israel is archaeologically weak. The Stepped Stone Structure and Large Stone Structure in Jerusalem, assuming Eilat Mazar&#x27;s contested stratigraphic dating of the structures to the Iron Age I is accurate, show that Jerusalem was at least somewhat populated in King David&#x27;s time, and lends some credence to the biblical claim that Jerusalem was originally a Canaanite fortress; however, Jerusalem seems to have been barely developed until long after David&#x27;s death, bringing into question the possibility that it could have been the imperial capital described in the Bible. In David&#x27;s time, the capital probably served as little more than a formidable citadel, and the Davidic &quot;kingdom&quot; was most likely closer to a loosely-confederated regional polity, albeit a relatively substantial one. On the other hand, excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa and Eglon, as well as structures from Hazor, Gezer, Megiddo and other sites conventionally dated to the 10th century BCE, are interpreted by many scholars to show that Judah was capable of accommodating large-scale urban societies centuries before minimalist scholars claim, and some have taken the physical archaeology of tenth-century Canaan as consistent with the former existence of a unified state on its territory, as archaeological findings demonstrate substantial development and growth at several sites, plausibly related to the tenth century. Even so, as for David and his immediate descendants themselves, the position of some scholars, as described by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman, authors of &quot;The Bible Unearthed&quot;, espouses that David and Solomon may well be based on &quot;certain historical kernels&quot;, and probably did exist in their own right, but their historical counterparts simply could not have ruled over a wealthy lavish empire as described in the Bible, and were more likely chieftains of a comparatively modest Israelite society in Judah and not regents over a kingdom proper.

==Kingdom of Israel and Judah==
According to the Tanakh, upon being chosen and becoming king, one was customarily anointed with holy oil poured on one&#x27;s head. In David&#x27;s case, this was done by the prophet Samuel.

Initially, David was king over the Tribe of Judah only and ruled from Hebron, but after seven and a half years, the other Israelite tribes, who found themselves leaderless after the death of Ish-bosheth, chose him to be their king as well.

All subsequent kings in both the ancient first united Kingdom of Israel and the later Kingdom of Judah claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.

=== Division after Solomon&#x27;s death ===
After the death of David&#x27;s son, King Solomon, the ten northern tribes of the Kingdom of Israel rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon&#x27;s son, Rehoboam, and instead chose as king Jeroboam and formed the northern Kingdom of Israel. This kingdom was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as The Ten Lost Tribes or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as Samaritans during the classic era and to modern times.

==The Exilarchate==

Later rabbinical authorities granted the office of exilarch to family members that traced its patrilineal descent from David, King of Israel. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch (Reish Galuta, &quot;Head of the Diaspora&quot;). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line. The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylonia in the Achaemenid Empire as well as during the classic era. The Seder Olam Zutta attributes the office to Zerubbabel, a member of the Davidic line, who is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 6th century BC, holding the title of Achaemenid Governor of Yehud Medinata.

==Hasmonean and Herodian periods==

The Hasmoneans, also known as the Maccabees, established their own monarchy in Judea following their revolt against the Hellenistic Seleucid dynasty. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the Tribe of Judah. The Levites had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled Second Temple, a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within Orthodox Judaism, this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of Herod the Great as client king over the Roman province of Judea; and the subsequent destruction of the Second Temple by the future Emperor Titus.

During the Hasmonean period, the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members had risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was Hillel the Elder, who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great-grandson Simeon ben Gamliel became one of the Jewish leaders during the First Jewish–Roman War.

==Middle Ages==
The Exilarchate in the Sasanian Empire was briefly abolished as a result of a revolt by the Mar-Zutra II in the late 5th century CE, with his son Mar-Zutra III being denied the office and relocating to Tiberias, then within the Byzantine Empire. Mar Ahunai lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then () he really acted as Exilarch. The names of Kafnai and his son Haninai, who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.

The Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the Arab conquest in the 7th century and continued to function during the early Caliphates. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exilarch family in the 11th century; according to one version Hezekiah ben David, who was the last Exilarch and also the last Gaon, was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Al-Andalus, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of Samuel ibn Naghrillah. However, &quot;The Jewish Quarterly Review&quot; mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046. An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in the Fatimid Caliphate failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.

In the 11th–15th century, families that descended from the Exilarchs that lived in the South of France (Narbonne and Provence) and in northern Iberian peninsula (Barcelona, Aragon and Castile) received the title &quot;Nasi&quot; in the communities and were called &quot;free men&quot;. They had a special economic and social status in the Jewish community, and they were close to their respective governments, some serving as advisers and tax collectors/finance ministers.

These families had special rights in Narbonne, Barcelona, and Castile. They possessed real estate and received the title &quot;Don&quot; and  &quot;de la Kblriih&quot; (&quot;De la Cavalleria&quot;). Among the families of the &quot;Sons of the Free&quot; are the families of Abravanel and Benveniste.

In his book, &quot;A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France&quot;, Arthur J. Zuckerman proposes a theory that from 768 to 900 CE a Jewish Princedom ruled by members of the Exilarchs existed in feudal France. However, this theory has been widely contested. Descendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. The grandson of Hezekiah ben David through his eldest son David ben Chyzkia, Hiyya al-Daudi, died in 1154 in Castile according to Abraham ibn Daud and is the ancestor of the ibn Yahya family. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of David ben Zakkai who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp. 180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.

A number of Jewish families in the Iberian peninsula and within Mesopotamia continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in the Late Middle Ages, including the families of Abravanel, ibn Yahya and Ben-David. The patriarch of the Coronel Family, Abraham Senior, is referred to in a letter of 1487 from the Jews of Castile to the Jews of Rome and Lombardy as &#x27;the Exilarch who is over us&#x27;. Several Ashkenazi scholars also claimed descent from King David. On his father&#x27;s side, Rashi has been claimed to be a 33rd-generation descendant of Johanan HaSandlar, who was a fourth-generation descendant of Gamaliel, who was reputedly descended from the Davidic line. Similarly Maimonides claimed 37 generations between him and Simeon ben Judah ha-Nasi, who was also a fourth-generation descendant of Gamaliel. Meir Perels traced the ancestry of Judah Loew ben Bezalel to the Hai Gaon through Judah Loew&#x27;s alleged great-great-grandfather Judah Leib the Elder and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty; however, this claim is widely disputed, by many scholars such as Otto Muneles. Hai Gaon was the son of Sherira Gaon, who claimed descent from Rabbah b. Abuha, who belonged to the family of the exilarch, thereby claiming descent from the Davidic line. Sherira&#x27;s son-in-law was Elijah ben Menahem HaZaken. The patriarch of the Meisels family, Yitskhak Eizik Meisels, was an alleged 10th generation descendant of the Exilarch, Mar Ukba. The Berduga family of Meknes claim paternal descent from the Exilarch, Bostanai. The Jewish banking family Louis Cahen d&#x27;Anvers claimed descent from the Davidic Line Rabbi Yosef Dayan, who is a modern-day claimant to the Davidic throne in Israel and the founder of the Monarchist party Malchut Israel, descends from the Dayan family of Aleppo, who paternally descend from Hasan ben Zakkai, the younger brother of the Exilarch David I (d. 940). One of Hasan&#x27;s descendants Solomon ben Azariah ha-Nasi settled in Aleppo were the family became Dayan&#x27;s (judges) of the city and thus adopted the surname Dayan.

== In Judaism ==

=== Eschatology ===
In Jewish eschatology, the term &#x27;, or &quot;Messiah&quot;, came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who is expected to be anointed with holy anointing oil and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. The Messiah is often referred to as &quot;King Messiah&quot;, or, in Hebrew, (&#x27;), and, in Aramaic, &quot;malka meshiḥa&quot;.

Orthodox views have generally held that the Messiah will be a patrilineal descendant of King David, and will gather the Jews back into the Land of Israel, usher in an era of peace, build the Third Temple, father a male heir, re-institute the Sanhedrin, and so on. Jewish tradition alludes to two redeemers, both of whom are called &#x27; and are involved in ushering in the Messianic age: &#x27;; and &quot;Mashiach ben Yosef&quot;. In general, the term &quot;Messiah&quot; unqualified refers to &quot;Mashiach ben David&quot; (Messiah, son of David).

=== Modern legacy ===
In 2012, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that philanthropist Susan Roth created Davidic Dynasty as subsidiary of her Eshet Chayil Foundation, dedicated to finding, databasing, and connecting Davidic descendants and running the King David Legacy Center in Jerusalem. In 2020, Roth chose Brando Crawford, a descendant from both grandfathers, to represent the organization internationally. The King David Legacy Center has seen support from Haredi Jews in Jerusalem.

==In other Abrahamic religions==

=== Christianity ===
In the Christian interpretation the &quot;Davidic covenant&quot; of a Davidic line in 2 Samuel 7 is understood in various ways, traditionally referring to the genealogies of Jesus in the New Testament. One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line as continuing to Jesus son of Joseph, according to the genealogies which are written in Matthew 1:1-16 descendants of Solomon and Luke 3:23-38 descendants of Nathan son of David through the line of Mary.

Because Jews have historically believed that the Messiah will be a male-line descendant of David, the lineage of Jesus is sometimes cited as a reason why Jews do not believe that he was the Messiah. As the proposed son of God, he could not have been a male descendant of David because according to the genealogy of his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, he did not have the proper lineage, because he would not have been a male descendant of Mary, and Joseph, who was a descendant of Jeconiah, because Jeconiah&#x27;s descendants are explicitly barred from ever ruling Israel by God.

Another Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through Solomon&#x27;s brother Nathan as it is recorded in the Gospel of Luke chapter 3 (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary&#x27;s father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon to the godlessness of the line of Jehoiachin which started in the early 500s BC, when Jeremiah cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, by saying that no descendant of &quot;[Je]Coniah&quot; would ever reign on the throne of Israel again (Jeremiah 22:30). Some Christian commentators also believe that this same &quot;curse&quot; is the reason why Zerubbabel, the rightful Solomonic king during the time of Nehemiah, was not given a kingship under the Persian empire.

The Tree of Jesse (a reference to David&#x27;s father) is a traditional Christian artistic representation of Jesus&#x27; genealogical connection to David.

=== Islam ===
The Quran mentions the House of David once: &quot;Work, O family of David, in gratitude. And few of My servants are grateful.&quot; and mentions David himself sixteen times.

According to some Islamic sources, some of the Jewish settlers in Arabia were of the Davidic line, Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi recorded: &quot;A Jewish man from the Davidic line entered Medina and found the people in deep sorrow. He enquired the people, &#x27;What is wrong?&#x27; Some of the people replied: Prophet Muhammad passed away&quot;.

<doc id="877044" wikidata="Q2252436" url="?curid=877044" title="Project Moonbase">
<text>Project Moonbase (a.k.a. Project Moon Base) is a 1953 independently made black-and-white science fiction film, produced by Jack Seaman, directed by Richard Talmadge, and starring Ross Ford, Donna Martell, and Hayden Rorke. It co-stars Larry Johns, Herb Jacobs, Barbara Morrison, and Ernestine Barrier. The film was distributed by Lippert Pictures and is based on a story by Robert A. Heinlein, who shares the screenwriting credit with producer Jack Seaman.

&quot;Project Moonbase&quot; is unusual for its time in attempting to portray space travel in a &quot;realistic&quot; manner and for depicting a future in which women hold positions of authority and responsibility equal to men; as an example, the President of the United States is a woman. However, Colonel Breiteis, the female commander of the Moon mission, is shown to be picked for her gender, generally shown as a member of a &quot;weaker sex&quot;, and even threatened with a spanking by her commanding officer.

&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; featured the film in January 1990 as an episode during its first season on The Comedy Channel. It had been originally broadcast in 1986 as a syndicated television episode of the &quot;Canned Film Festival&quot;.

==Plot==
In a future 1970, the United States is considering building bases on the Moon. Colonel Briteis (pronounced &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, whose first name is never stated, played by Donna Martell), Major Bill Moore (Ross Ford), and Doctor Wernher (Larry Johns) are sent to orbit the Moon to survey landing sites for future lunar missions. However, Wernher is an impostor whose secret mission is to destroy the US&#x27;s Earth-orbiting space station, which he plans to do by colliding the rocket with the station on the way back from the Moon. Col. Briteis, who made the first orbital flight around the Earth four years earlier, is arrogant and distrusting of Major Moore. Moore, in turn had a romantic interest in Briteis when they began in the United States Space Force, but was rejected in favor of Briteis&#x27;s ambition to be the first person on the Moon.

Moore realizes that the man claiming to be Wernher is actually a spy for an unnamed country, because the impostor has no knowledge of Wernher&#x27;s expertise nor of the Brooklyn Dodgers, despite having supposedly taught in Brooklyn. In the ensuing struggle for control of the rocket, Colonel Briteis accidentally hits the boosters, which saves their lives but leaves the ship critically low on fuel. She takes unfair blame which Moore assures her is not her fault. Briteis then realizes she may not have all the answers and does need Moore&#x27;s help on the mission. They are forced to make an emergency landing on the Moon, and with them all marooned the fake Wernher redeems himself by helping Moore establish communications with Earth, although an accident results in his untimely death.

In response to the unexpected turn of events, the US authorities decide to make the immobilized spaceship the core of a Moon base. Later General Greene has a man-to-man talk with Moore about his feelings for Briteis. Greene observes that Briteis and Moore will be isolated for weeks or months—perhaps even years—and public opinion, the USSF and the President would want them to be married. Moore expresses doubts about her feelings for him, and tells Green, &quot;she has no use for me.&quot; Briteis, after overhearing this, secretly agrees to marry Moore and she cuts a deal with Greene to promote Moore to brigadier general and in command of Project Moonbase to make up for her earlier actions towards him.

After a video wedding officiated by a USSF chaplain, and witnessed by Greene, Briteis pins a paper star on Moore, thereby indicating his new rank of Brigadier General, one above her rank of Colonel. The couple then kisses, thereby signaling the beginning of their married life, and the end of the movie.

==Cast==
* Donna Martell as Colonel Briteis
* Hayden Rorke as Gen. &#x27;Pappy&#x27; Greene
* Ross Ford as Maj. Bill Moore
* Larry Johns as Doctor Wernher
* Herb Jacobs as Mr. Roundtree
* Barbara Morrison as Polly Prattles
* Ernestine Barrier as Madame President
* James Craven as Commodore Carlson
* John Hedloe as Adjutant
* Peter Adams as Captain Carmody

==Production and release==
Both &quot;Project Moonbase&quot; and &quot;Cat-Women of the Moon&quot; (also 1953) were made using some of the same sets and costumes. The two films were released within one day of each other, though from different distributors.
&quot;Project Moonbase&quot; was shot in 10 days.

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==
&quot;Project Moonbase&quot; was featured in episode #109 of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; along with Chapters 7 and 8 of &quot;Radar Men from the Moon&quot;, a Commando Cody serial. The episode debuted January 6, 1990, on the Comedy Channel. Kevin Murphy, who worked on the show and would become a cast member the next season, wrote, &quot;The best thing I can say about it is that it was very very short,&quot; calling the film &quot;openly and condescendingly hostile toward women as a gender&quot;.

As with most first-season episodes of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, &quot;Project Moonbase&quot; is not considered one of the series&#x27; better efforts; it did not make their Top 100 list, as voted upon by MST3K Season 11 Kickstarter backers. Writer Jim Vogel ranked the episode #164 (out of 191 total MST3K episodes). Vogel said, &quot;There&#x27;s some glimmers of later-season MST3k goodness in there...&quot;

The MST3K version of &quot;Project Moonbase&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000 Volume XX&quot; DVD collection, released by Shout! Factory in March 2011. The other episodes in the four-disc set include &quot;Master Ninja I&quot; (episode #320), &quot;Master Ninja II&quot; (episode #324), and &quot;The Magic Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (episode #505).

<doc id="877045" wikidata="Q1939053" url="?curid=877045" title="Flat Rock Assembly Plant">
<text>Flat Rock Assembly Plant, formerly known as the Michigan Casting Center (1972–1981), Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA (1987–1992) and AutoAlliance International (1992–2012), is a Ford Motor Company assembly plant located at Drive in Flat Rock, Michigan in Metro Detroit.

The plant currently comprises of production space and employs 3,510 hourly workers and 140 salaried workers. The plant currently manufactures the Ford Mustang.

== History ==
=== Michigan Casting Center (1972–1981) ===

Following three years of work and the largest single investment by Ford, the Michigan Casting Center (MCC) opened in January 1972, at the time one of the most technologically advanced casting facilities in the world. Despite the sizable capital investment, frequent union labor problems and work injuries and declining demand for the V8 engine blocks produced there led the facility&#x27;s closure in 1981.

A worker, Robert Williams, was killed by an industrial robot arm on January 25, 1979. He is the first known human to be killed by a robot.

=== Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA (1987–1992) ===
Mazda Motor Corporation started construction of a new building on the site of the Michigan Casting Center in 1985 and cars started production at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA in September 1987 with the Mazda MX-6 and Ford Probe coupes. In 1991 the plant had 3,600 employees, including 250 Japanese employees.

=== AutoAlliance International (1992–2012) ===
Ford repurchased a 50% share in the plant on April 15, 1992, and it officially became a joint-venture and was renamed AutoAlliance International on July 1, 1992. The plant began production of all models of the Mazda 626 sold in America starting in 1993. During this era, Deepak Ahuja was Chief Financial Officer of the joint venture. The Ford Contour-derived Mercury Cougar was produced at the plant from 1998 to 2002. Production of North American Mazda 6 began in the 2003 model year, followed by the Ford Mustang starting in 2005.

The last Mazda 6 rolled off the line on Friday, August 24, 2012, with Mazda discontinuing production on American soil, effectively ending the 20 year joint-venture between Mazda and Ford. Mazda moved production of the Mazda 6 back to the Hofu factory in Japan and opened a new factory in Salamanca, Mexico to build the Mazda 2 and Mazda 3 subcompact and compact cars.

=== Flat Rock Assembly Plant (since 2012) ===
On September 10, 2012, Ford Motor Company re-took full management control of the plant, renaming it the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant, and confirming $555 million in investments designed to retool the plant for the production of the 2013 Ford Fusion midsize sedan.

On July 15, 2015, Ford confirmed that the new 2017 Lincoln Continental sedan would be produced at the Flat Rock plant starting in 2016.

On January 3, 2017, Ford announced that it will begin manufacturing an electric small SUV by 2020, and a high passenger volume autonomous vehicle designed for commercial ride hailing or ride sharing by 2021, both to be built at Flat Rock.

Ford reduced production of the plant from two shifts to one due to lower demand for the Ford Mustang and especially the Lincoln Continental. Over 1,000 workers were laid off in April 2019, including almost 500 temporary workers.

In March 2019, Ford announced change of its plan, production of battery-electric vehicle would not start until 2023.

<doc id="877047" wikidata="Q1188657" url="?curid=877047" title="Iou Kuroda">
<text>is the pen name of a Japanese manga artist.

==Biography==
Born in Sapporo as one of two twins, Kuroda moved many times in his youth. He graduated from Hitotsubashi University. The pen name &quot;Kuroda Iou&quot; (in Japanese order) is a combination of his family name (Kuroda) and the name of a toy robot, Mars King (Kasei Daiō): Kuroda + Kasei Daiō -&gt; Kurodaiō -&gt; Kuroda Iō.

Kuroda&#x27;s works are known for their dynamic plot developments and the rhythm of their stories. His drawings are widely praised for their almost magical appeal. Elephants, cameras, bicycles, ships, robots, and cooking are common motifs in Kuroda&#x27;s manga.

In 2002, Kuroda won the Excellence Prize at the 2002 Japan Media Arts Festival for his manga &quot;Sexy Voice and Robo&quot;. In 2007, the manga was adapted into a television drama, starring Kenichi Matsuyama and Suzuka Ohgo, which aired between April and June 2007 on Nippon Television.

In 2003, Kuroda&#x27;s work &quot;Nasu&quot; was brought to the attention of animator and director Kitarō Kōsaka by Kōsaka&#x27;s long-time collaborator from Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki, a fan of cycling. He adapted the &quot;Summer in Andalusia&quot; chapter from the manga into the film, &quot;&quot;, which soon went on to become the first Japanese anime film ever to be selected for the Cannes Film Festival. A sequel, &quot;&quot;, was also later produced, which won the best Original Video Animation award at the seventh annual Tokyo Anime Awards, held at the 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair.

<doc id="877050" wikidata="Q1133670" url="?curid=877050" title="The Pharaoh's Daughter">
<text>The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter (; ), is a ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa to music by Cesare Pugni. The libretto was a collaboration between Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Petipa from Théophile Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Le Roman de la momie&quot;. It was first presented by the Imperial Ballet at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 18 January (30 January) 1862, with the design by A. Roller, G. Wagner (scenery), Kelwer and Stolyakov (costumes).

The principal dancers at the opening night were Carolina Rosati (Mummy/Aspicia), Nicholas Goltz (Pharaoh), Marius Petipa (Ta-Hor), Timofey Stoukolkin as John Bull, Lubov Radina (Ramzaya), Felix Kschessinskiy (King of Nubia), and Lev Ivanov (Fisherman). For Petipa it was the last role: he has finished his career as a dancer; he became ballet master.
The Sergeyev Collection, which is part of the Harvard University Theatre Collection, contains choreographic notations of the Imperial Ballet&#x27;s production of &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, created circa 1905. The notations document the choreography and mise-en-scène as staged by Marius Petipa for his last revival of 1898, which was mounted especially for the benefit performance of Mathilde Kschessinskaya.

== Plot ==
An English lord and John Bull, his servant, and a guide shelter from a sandstorm in a pyramid during an African safari. They start to become noisy, but the guide asks them to quiet down in respect for the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter who is lying in a coffin somewhere in the pyramid. So, to pass the time, the guide gives out opium. As soon as the nobleman puffs the opium, weird things start to happen. The many other mummies in the pyramid start to come alive. Suddenly the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, Aspicia, comes alive and lays her hand over the nobleman&#x27;s heart, and the nobleman is transported into the past. He becomes Ta-Hor, an ancient Egyptian man who saves Aspicia from a lion. Ta-Hor and Aspicia fall in love, but she is betrothed to the Nubian king. They run away together and the king chases them. Ta-Hor and Aspicia stop in a fishermen&#x27;s inn to hide out, and the local fishermen ask them if they want to come on a fishing trip. Aspicia decides to stay behind. Then the Nubian king stops at the inn to rest and finds Aspicia who jumps into the Nile River to escape his guards.

At the bottom of the river, the Spirit of the Nile summons the great rivers of the world to dance for Aspicia, then he tells her that she must stay. When she hears this, she asks for one wish: to bring her back to land. When the fishermen and Ta-Hor arrive back on land, the Nubian king detains Ta-Hor and brings him back to the Pharaoh&#x27;s palace to be punished for &quot;kidnapping&quot; the princess.

When Aspicia comes back to land, the fishermen bring her back to the palace. She gets there in time to see Ta-Hor sentenced to death by a cobra bite. She explains that if he dies, she dies, and reaches out for the snake to bite her. The Pharaoh pulls her back and grants her permission to marry Ta-Hor, and the Nubian king leaves in a fit of rage, swearing revenge. Everyone starts to celebrate, but as the party reaches its peak, the opium dream ends and Ta-Hor is transformed back into the English lord. As they leave the pyramid, the nobleman looks back at Aspicia&#x27;s coffin and remembers the love that they shared and still share.

== History ==
&quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (&quot;La Fille du pharaon&quot;) was the first multi-act &quot;grand ballet&quot; Marius Petipa staged during his long career with the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The ballet was staged especially for the benefit performance of the Italian ballerina Carolina Rosati, who performed the principal role of the Princess Aspicia. She danced opposite Marius Petipa, who portrayed Aspicia&#x27;s hero and lover, Lord Wilson/Ta-Hor. The premiere on was an enormous success, and soon the ballet became the most popular work in the repertoire of the Imperial Ballet. 

Marius Petipa staged &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot; while he was still serving as assistant ballet master to Arthur Saint-Léon, who from 1859 until 1869 served as &quot;Premier Maître de Ballet&quot; to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The success of &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot; earned for Petipa the position of second &quot;Maître de Ballet&quot;, a position he would hold until Saint-Léon&#x27;s departure from Russia in 1869.

Petipa revived &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 1885 and again in 1898. In 1905, Alexander Gorsky put on a modified production for the Imperial Bolshoi Ballet without Petipa&#x27;s approval, and the ballet continued to be performed until 1928. In 2000, it was revived in Pierre Lacotte&#x27;s restaging for the Bolshoi Ballet, which Lacotte based partly on the Stepanov notation recording Petipa&#x27;s final production and partly on the personal recollections of Russian dancers. It has since become a regular part of the Bolshoi&#x27;s repertory. In 2023 the Mariinsky Ballet premiered a historical production. This production is based on the Stepanov notations and other materials. It was staged by the choreographer Toni Candeloro in collaboration with notation interpreter Juan Bockamp. Set and costume designs where produced by Robert Perdizola.
It was also a production of the choreographic trend parallel to that of the grand opera in music, towards the ballet &quot;à grand spectacle&quot;, which lasted four hours and used different styles and techniques and a large number of people (about 400), with plots characterized by strong dramatic contrasts.

Marius Petipa changed the art of classical ballet by inserting &quot;divertissements&quot;, or displays of dance that were perhaps symbolic or loose importance to the story, as a display for dancers that were not the leads. This was important because, at the time, many foreign guest artists were being brought in and the Russian-trained, Russian-dancers were not being given the chance to display their own talents. Marius Petipa started putting these &quot;divertissements&quot; in all of his ballets (&quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;La Bayadère&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, etc.) and the &quot;divertissement&quot; itself became a technique used by many choreographers as a way to give dancers time to change costumes, shoes, or create a scene break.

The interest in Ancient Egypt at the time, inspired by recent archaeological finds, as well as Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Le Roman de la momie&quot;, gave Petipa the push to create &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. These interests and finds inspired a new wave of costuming, such as the newly shortened tutu being decorated with Egyptian jewelry and ornamentation. These decorations were meant to give the audience a better feel to the ballet and reflect Egyptian nationality. Some of these costumes could be considered racist, as the leads were dressed in beautiful, expensive costumes, where the Nationalistic dances could be covered in blackface. They were meant to inspire a feeling of Egyptian taste, but authenticity was often compromised for opulence and could be considered entirely offensive.

The ballet&#x27;s literary source is &quot;Le Roman de la momie&quot; by Théophile Gautier, an exponent of literary exoticism which offered all sorts of romantic expedients: the passionate love story of the great Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter and Tahoser set in a Biblical Egypt which, however, disappeared in the ballet, and the Gothic taste for gloomy corridors and dark tombs. What the ballet retains of Gautier&#x27;s world is the sense of the fantastic which accompanies earthly passions. With an artifact from the past or a puff of opium – a familiar influence in the works and lives of contemporary artists such as De Quincey – allowed Gautier to add a brighter aura to his characters by setting them on the borderline between life and death from which all Egyptian art took nourishment.

So as not to overwhelm his readers with terror, Gautier frequently appeals to irony, which has an anticlimactic effect. Irony serves the same function in the ballet, for example in the moment when Lord Wilson, the quintessence of Englishness, impassively attempts to sketch the scene of the desert disturbed by the simoom, or when Aspicia, after rising from the sarcophagus, looks into a mirror and is pleased to find herself as pretty as she was a few millennia before.

The story called for an artist in the title role who had a special dramatic talent (as did Rosati), because of all the scenes of love, fear, and courage which culminate in Aspicia&#x27;s attempt to cast herself onto a flower-basket hiding a snake, a classic gesture since Cleopatra&#x27;s time. Twenty years later, Virginia Zucchi (less conventionally) portrayed an unusually humane princess, not as arrogant and voluptuous as that of her successor Mathilde Kschessinskaya who, on the other hand, made it more of a virtuoso role.

Petipa&#x27;s penchant for folklore enhanced the dance of bayadères and the pageant of the rivers (from Guadalquivir to Neva), all dressed up in national costumes, but historical inaccuracy and the mixing of styles raised a few criticisms, especially in Moscow, in spite of the general taste for sets and costumes reinvented with a minimum of realism and a maximum of grandeur.

<text>John David Wolverton (May 28, 1957 – January 14, 2022), better known by his pen names Dave Wolverton and David Farland, was an American author, editor, and instructor of online writing workshops and groups. He wrote in several genres but was known best for his science fiction and fantasy works. Books in his Runelords series hit the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers list. 

In 1987, he won the Writers of the Future contest. He has been nominated for a Nebula Award and a Hugo Award. He died in the early morning hours of January 14, 2022. He lived in St. George, Utah, with his wife at the time of his death.

==Life and career==
Wolverton was born May 28, 1957, in Springfield, Oregon to Jack and Lola Jean Wolverton. His family moved to a farm in Monroe when he was six years old, where he grew up and graduated from Monroe High School. Following graduation, he served a volunteer mission in Illinois for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Afterward, he attended Ricks College before transferring to Brigham Young University. He met his wife, Mary, there, and they married in the Provo Utah Temple on June 22, 1985. He and his wife had two daughters and three sons.

He began writing in 1985 during college, publishing the short story &quot;The Sky Is an Open Highway&quot; in the fall 1985 issue of &quot;The Leading Edge&quot;. Following that, he entered short stories into various contests, eventually winning first place in the 1987 Writers of the Future contest with the novella &quot;On My Way to Paradise&quot;. The story was expanded into the novel of the same name, published in 1989 through Bantam Spectra. The novel was nominated for multiple awards, including the Philip K. Dick Award for &quot;Best Novel in the English Language&quot;. 

He became a judge for the Writers of the Future contest in 1991 and was the Coordinating Judge and Editor at the time of his death. After co-editing volume 8 with Algis Budrys in 1992, he took over editing of the annual anthology from volume 9 until volume 14 before passing the role back to Algis Budrys. Wolverton again took over editing the anthology from K. D. Wentworth, beginning with volume 29 and continuing through volume 37.

His historical novel, &quot;In the Company of Angels&quot;, won the 2009 Whitney Award for best novel of the year, and was a finalist in the best historical novel category. Wolverton also received an outstanding achievement award at the 2009 Whitneys. In 2012, his young adult fantasy thriller &quot;Nightingale&quot; won the International Book Award for best Young Adult Novel of the Year, the Grand Prize at the Hollywood Book Festival, and the Southern California Book Festival for Best Young Adult Novel. It was also a finalist in the Global Ebook Awards. He has been nominated for other awards, including the Nebula Award in the Best Novelette category for his short story &quot;After a Lean Winter&quot;.

In the summer of 1998, Dave Wolverton broke the world record for the largest single author book signing which he achieved with &quot;A Very Strange Trip&quot;, a book he wrote based on a story by L. Ron Hubbard. He wrote under his own name at the beginning of his career, changing to the pseudonym David Farland in the mid-1990s with the release of the first &quot;Runelords&quot; book. Wolverton chose the pseudonym in order to have a name more fitting for a Fantasy author and so his physical books would be shelved closer to customers&#x27; eye levels in bookstores, rather than on lower shelves as the last name Wolverton had.

Wolverton worked as an English professor of creative writing at Brigham Young University from 1999 to 2002, and held writing workshops for aspiring and established writers. The creative writing class he taught at BYU was taken over by one of his former students, Brandon Sanderson. He taught other writers such as Brandon Mull, Jessica Day George, Eric Flint, Stephenie Meyer, James Dashner, as well as others.

He worked in the gaming industry and greenlit screenplays in Hollywood. In 1998, Wolverton started working part-time at Saffire Studios, helping create video games. He was responsible for the concept of &quot;lurkers&quot; in the well-known RTS (Real-time strategy) game . In 2002, he began working as a movie producer and also greenlighted movies. He was working on a film adaptation of his Runelords series.

On January 13, 2022, Wolverton suffered from a fall, resulting in a severe head injury and a hemorrhagic stroke. He was on life support until he died early the next morning at the age of 64 in St. George, Utah. He was buried in the Tonaquint Cemetery in St. George, Utah. At the time of his death he was known to be working on three books: A rewrite of 2011&#x27;s &quot;Nightingale&quot;, a new Runelords installment titled &quot;A Tale of Tales&quot;, and a fourth book in his Ravenspell series titled &quot;S.W.A.R.M.&quot;

<doc id="877062" wikidata="Q713699" url="?curid=877062" title="John Goldthorpe">
<text>John Harry Goldthorpe (born 27 May 1935) is a British sociologist. He is an emeritus Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford. His main research interests are in the fields of social stratification and mobility, and comparative macro-sociology. He also writes on methodological issues in relation to the integration of empirical, quantitative research and theory with a particular focus on issues of causation. 

== Early life ==
Goldthorpe was born in Great Houghton, a remote mining village in the then West Riding of Yorkshire. His father was a colliery clerk and his mother a dressmaker. He was educated at Wath Grammar School, and then took a first class honours degree in history at University College London, being much influenced by the teaching of Alfred Cobban and Gustaaf Renier. Afterwards, he became a graduate student in sociology at the London School of Economics.

== Academic career ==
Goldthorpe was a Junior Research Fellow and Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Sociology at the University of Leicester from 1957 to 1960, working on the structure of a new degree with Ilya Neustadt and Norbert Elias.  

In 1960 he was elected to a Prize Fellowship in Sociology at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge – the first position in sociology to be established in the University. He taught history at King&#x27;s and from 1962, as University Assistant Lecturer and then Lecturer, sociology courses within the revised Economics Tripos. He formed close relationships with his colleague, David Lockwood, and also with T. H. Marshall who was living in retirement in Cambridge.  

In 1969 he was elected to an Official Fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford, and remained there until his retirement in 2002. He has had many graduate students who have become noted sociologists in Britain and abroad including Tak-Wing Chan, John Child, Colin Crouch, Gorana Djoric, Ricca Edmondson, Geoff Evans, Duncan Gallie, Anne Gauthier, Brendan Halpin, Niamh Hardiman, Anthony Heath, Geoffrey Ingham, Michelle Jackson, Yao-jun Li, Susan MacRae, John McCallum, José-Maria Maravall, Gordon Marshall, Deborah Posel, William Roche, Graeme Salaman, Sawako Shirahase and Meir Yaish.

From 1970 to 1973 Goldthorpe was Editor of &quot;Sociology.&quot; But from the mid-1970s he became disappointed and disillusioned with the state of sociology in Britain, chiefly because of what he regarded as the undue dominance of socio-political commitments and pseudo-philosophical positions and the disregard of, if not actual hostility towards, new quantitative methods. He left the British Sociological Association and, outside of Oxford, worked mainly with European colleagues, notably Robert Erikson at the Swedish Institute for Social Research, University of Stockholm, and Walter Müller at the University of Mannheim.  In the late 1980s he acted as consultant on sociological research in the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He played a leading role in the creation of the &quot;European Sociological Review&quot; and in the formation of the European Consortium for Sociological Research.

He became an Emeritus Fellow of Nuffield in 2002 but continues to be research active.

==Research==

While at Cambridge, Goldthorpe undertook, together with David Lockwood, Frank Bechhofer and Jennifer Platt, the &quot;Affluent Worker&quot; studies, which called into question the idea of the &quot;embourgeoisement&quot; of the British working class. 

After arriving at Nuffield, he co-directed the Nuffield Social Mobility study of 1972, which introduced the loglinear modelling of social class mobility tables, leading to the crucial distinction between absolute and relative mobility rates. Several prevailing views about mobility in mid-twentieth century Britain were challenged. During the 1980s he worked with Robert Erikson and Walter Müller on the CASMIN project – a cross-national comparative study of intergenerational class mobility. On the basis of further technical innovations in the analysis of mobility tables, Erikson and Goldthorpe developed the concept of a ‘core model’ of such mobility, which, they suggested, was prevalent, with national-specific variations, across all advanced industrial societies.

In the course of this work the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero (EGP) class schema was developed and has subsequently been widely used in comparative social research. A specifically British version of the schema was also developed by Goldthorpe and this provided the theoretical basis for the Office for National Statistics&#x27; Socio-Economic Classification which, in 2002, was introduced into British official statistics in replacement of the old Registrar-General&#x27;s Social Classes.

In the 1990s Goldthorpe concentrated mainly on theoretical and methodological issues, in particular on the understanding of social causation and, relatedly, on the application of rational action theory in the explanation of the probabilistic empirical regularities typically established through large-scale social survey research. As an illustration, he produced, together with Richard Breen, a rational action model of class-linked differences in educational choice, which has been widely tested and discussed.  He also worked with Robert Erikson and Michelle Jackson on ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ effects in the creation of educational inequalities and, with these colleagues and in collaboration with David Cox, proposed statistical methods for distinguishing between the two and determining their relative importance.

Subsequently, Goldthorpe joined forces with Tak-Wing Chan in elaborating the Weberian distinction between social class and social status and showing its importance in studies of cultural participation. Their theoretical position and research has led to much controversy with followers of Pierre Bourdieu, who reject the distinction between class and status, but whose work Goldthorpe and Chan regard as being technically weak as regards both data collection and analysis and as failing to produce arguments clear enough to be open to empirical test.

For the last ten years Goldthorpe has returned to research in educational inequalities and social mobility in the context of projects directed by Erzsébet Bukodi. A series of both British and comparative analyses are brought together in their book, &quot;Social Mobility and Education in Britain: Research, Politics and Policy.&quot; A central theme of the book is the ‘disconnect’ that exists between the findings of sociological research and the discussion of social mobility and education in political and policy circles. In particular, the idea that educational expansion and reform can play a key role in increasing social mobility is questioned, and the hypothesis is advanced that in all societies with a capitalist market economy, a nuclear family system and a liberal-democratic polity, a limit exists to the extent to which relative chances of social mobility can be equalised. Research aimed at elaborating and testing this hypothesis continues.

Goldthorpe has also set out his views on the direction in which he believes that sociology is, appropriately, developing in his book &quot;Sociology as a Population Science,&quot; and to this he has then added a ‘prequel’, &quot;Pioneers of Sociological Science: Statistical Foundations and the Theory of Action&quot;.

Goldthorpe is a Fellow of the British Academy, a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, a Member of the Academia Europaea, an Honorary Fellow of the European Academy of Sociology, and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society.

<doc id="877070" wikidata="Q7459843" url="?curid=877070" title="Sha-Mail">
<text>was a 2G mailing and picture messaging service launched by J-Phone (now Softbank) in 2000 that allowed users to take a photo with their mobile phone and send it to another user on the service as an email attachment. A related service introduced in 2002, Video Sha-Mail, let users record and send videos as well. Sha-Mail was widely successful upon its launch, became a household name in Japan, and sparked a boom in camera phone services worldwide. The term derives from &quot;sha&quot;, the first part of the Japanese word , and mail (from email).

==History==
Sha-Mail development was led by Keiji Takao, who previously worked for Mazda. Takao came up with the idea on a sight-seeing trip to Hakone with his parents, where he saw a woman on a cable car using her mobile phone, apparently struggling to operate the device and unable to send a photo of the view. He recalled: &quot;Here she was, a lady furiously typing into her handset and trying to relay her feelings and excitement to her children or husband. I said to myself, &#x27;Gee, wouldn&#x27;t it be easier if there was some sort of an image to send with?&#x27;&quot; Takao also reportedly took inspiration from a survey he had read about adolescent girls keeping disposable cameras alongside their phones in their purse. J-Phone, meanwhile, was under pressure from competitors KDDI, which had a faster network, and NTT Docomo, which was preparing to move to 3G, and the company believed it could differentiate itself by focusing on email.

J-Phone launched the Sha-Mail service in November 2000 with the help of electronics company Sharp Corporation, who developed the J-SH04 phone with a built-in, back-facing CCD camera. The J-SH04 was among the first phones in the world with a fully-integrated camera, and at the time, Sha-Mail was Japan&#x27;s only service of its kind. 

The service was quite successful on the market, particularly with young people. J-Phone had sold around 3 million handsets with Sha-Mail enabled by January 2022. Almost three years later, 10 million users were on the service, with around 5 million users using Movie Sha-Mail. In 2002 Vodafone, which had by that point acquired J-Phone, launched Vodafone live! as a global service. By December 2002, the European launch of Vodafone live! brought in more than 380,000 users. 

This rapid growth helped J-Phone move from #3 to #2 in total wireless data subscribers. J-Phone&#x27;s competitors followed suit. Market leader NTT Docomo introduced a similar service with Sharp called i-shot and another named Foma, KDDI&#x27;s au introduced &quot;Photo Mail&quot; and &quot;Movie Mail&quot; services, and KDDI subsidiary TU-KA introduced &quot;Picture Mail.&quot; In the US, AT&amp;T (a NTT Docomo affiliate) launched the mMode Pix feature on Sony Ericsson T68i devices. Sha-Mail&#x27;s popularity also spawned tie-ins such as a magazine called &quot;J-Phone Sha-mail Hearts&quot; and the TV Aichi series &quot;Syamekke&quot;, which encouraged users to send in photos and text messages relating to weekly topics, later to be broadcast on the program. 

In November 2002, Japan&#x27;s fair trade commission raided Vodafone&#x27;s headquarters upon an accusation that the company had prevented retailers from lowering the cost of Sha-Mail enabled handsets upon launch.

Though Vodafone planned to make Sha-Mail a centerpiece of its 3G service, the company lagged well behind its competitors in moving to 3G and capturing users; as of 2004 fewer than 20% of Vodafone subscribers were subscribed to 3G. Thus the now-obsolete Sha-Mail never upgraded to 3G, effectively ending Sha-Mail once support for 2G networks ceased.

The word Japanese word &quot;shamēru&quot;, often abbreviated to &quot;shame&quot; (), now commonly refers to any text message with an image attached.

<text>Boris Andreyevich Pilnyak (&quot;né&quot; Vogau ; – April 21, 1938) was a Russian and Soviet writer who was executed by the Soviet Union on false claims of plotting to kill Joseph Stalin and Nikolay Yezhov.

==Biography==
He was born Boris Andreyevich Vogau () in Mozhaysk. His father was a doctor, descended from German farmers who settled on the banks of the Volga during the reign of Catherine the Great. His mother came from an old merchant family from Saratov. Boris first became interested in writing at the age of nine. Among his early influences were Andrei Bely, Aleksey Remizov, and Yevgeny Zamyatin.

Pilnyak achieved fame very quickly at the age of 25 through his novel &quot;The Naked Year&quot; (Голый год, 1922; translated into English 1928), one of the first fictional accounts of the Russian civil war. He was a major supporter of anti-urbanism and a critic of mechanized society, views which brought him into disfavor with Communist critics. The poet Demyan Bedny denounced him in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 16 October 1923 as a &#x27;stinking&#x27; member of the &#x27;horde of clueless fellow travellers&#x27;. The Old Bolshevik, Aleksandr Voronsky, founding editor of the journal &quot;Krasnaya nov&quot; (Red Virgin Soil), was offended by the remark, made by a character, that the Russian revolution &quot;smells of sexual organs&quot;, but acknowledged Pilnyak&#x27;s talent, and published his next work &quot;Materials for a Novel.&quot;

Pilnyak followed this with a strange short story &quot;The Tale of the Unextinguished Moon&quot;, published in the literary journal &quot;Novy Mir&quot; (&#x27;New World&#x27;) in May 1926. In the story. a Red Army commander is ordered by &#x27;the three who lead&#x27; to undergo a medical operation, which he does reluctantly. He dies on the operating table, the implication being that the &#x27;three who lead&#x27; had wanted him dead. In October 1925, Mikhail Frunze, who had replaced Trotsky at the head of the Red Army, died after being advised by the Politburo, then dominated by the triumvirate of Joseph Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, to undergo an operation. There is no evidence that Stalin wanted Frunze dead, and Pilnyak tried to cover himself against the charge of slandering the leadership by adding a note at the end of his story, dated 28 January 1926, saying that he hardly knew Frunze and that the reader should not look for &#x27;genuine facts and living persons&#x27; in the story. Nonetheless, the story created a scandal. Voronsky was shocked and embarrassed that the story was dedicated to him and declared that &quot;I reject this dedication with disgust.&quot; The offending edition of &quot;Novy Mir&quot; was banned and the OGPU visited all known subscribers to confiscate their copies. They were later sent a substitute edition with a different story in place of Pilnyak&#x27;s The magazine issued a public apology. He was in China, on a tour of the Far East when the storm broke, and could have defected, but instead hurried back to defend himself. Despite showing no enthusiasm for the Bolshevik revolution, he knew several high ranking communists, and turned for protection to the chief editor of &quot;Izvestya&quot;, Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov who introduced him to the Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (or prime minister) Alexei Rykov. At Rykov&#x27;s urging, he wrote a letter expressing remorse, which was published in &quot;Novy Mir&quot; in January 1927.

By now Pilnyak was second only to Maxim Gorky as the most read living Russian writer, in the Soviet Union and abroad. To protect his copyright had an arrangement under which all his works were published simultaneously in Moscow and Berlin. His best known novel, &quot;Mahogany&quot; (Кра́сное де́рево, 1927, translated 1965), was banned in Russia, but—like his other work—was published in Berlin. This gave Pilnyak&#x27;s enemy, Leopold Averbakh, head of the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers the pretext to launch an attack that was carried through four successive weekly editions of the &#x27;Literary Gazette&#x27;, which Averbakh controlled, and which headlines such as &#x27;A Hostile Network of Agents in the Ranks of Soviet Writers&#x27; and &#x27;Boris Pilnyak, Special Correspondent for the White Guard&#x27;. The poet Vladimir Mayakovsky joined in, claiming that &quot;at the present time of darkening storm clouds this is the same as treachery at the front&quot; and Maxim Gorky wrote to one of the secretaries of the Communist Party, Andrey Andreyev complaining about how &quot;Pilnyak has been forgiven for his story about the death of Comrade Frunze&quot;.

Unlike Yevgeny Zamyatin, who was subjected to a similar attack at the same time and refused to apologise or back down, Pilnyak capitulated and agreed to comply with the regime&#x27;s requirements. He found a new protector in Nikolai Yezhov, the future murderous head of the NKVD, who acted as his personal censor during the composition of his next novel, &quot;The Volga Flows into the Caspian Sea&quot; (Волга впадает в Каспийское море, 1930; translated 1931), which described the forced industrialisation drive in glowing language. Victor Serge visited Pilnyak while this work was in progress. &quot;Pilnyak would twist his great mouth. &#x27;He has given me a list of 50 passages to change outright! Ah!&#x27; he would exclaim, &#x27;if only I could write freely!&#x27; At other times I found him in the throes of depression. &#x27;They&#x27;ll end up by throwing me in jail, don&#x27;t you think?&#x27; I gave him heart by explaining that his fame in Europe and America safeguarded him.&quot; In &quot;Artists in Uniform&quot;, published in 1934 Max Eastman wrote a chapter entitled &quot;The Humiliation of Boris Pilnyak.&quot;

After he had debased himself, he was allowed to resume his place in the elite, and to travel to Paris, New York and Tokyo. Another of his well-known works is &quot;Okay! An American Novel&quot;, (О’кей! Американский роман, 1931; translated 1932), an unflattering travelogue of his 1931 visit to the United States. He used the visit to Japan to write &quot;A story about how stories come to be written&quot;. He was also allocated a private dacha on an estate reserved for privileged writers, where his neighbour was Boris Pasternak, one of the few who had defended him in 1929. In 1936, they were visited by the French novelist André Gide, who was seeking an honest opinion about life in the Soviet Union. A police informer told the NKVD that Pilnyak and Pasternak had several secret meetings with André Gide, and supplied him with information about the situation in the USSR. There is no doubt that Gide used this information in this book attacking the USSR.&quot;

Despite his public debasement, Pilnyak acted courageously in secret. When he heard that Karl Radek, a prominent member of the left wing opposition, was living in hardship after being exiled to Tomsk, Pilnyak sent him money. He also corresponded with the Spanish communist, Andres Nin, who broke with Stalin in 1927 and founded the POUM (the party George Orwell supported during the Spanish civil war). When Victor Serge was arrested in Moscow, Pilnyak urged Nin to generate international pressure to secure his release. This correspondence was discovered when the NKVD kidnapped Nin in Barcelona. On 28 October 1937, Pasternak dropped by to congratulate Pilnyak and his Georgian wife, Kira Andronikashvili, on their son&#x27;s third birthday. That evening, Pilnyak was arrested. He was accused of plotting to kill Stalin and Yezhov, and of being a Japanese spy. He was tried on 21 April 1938, pleaded guilty, and was shot the same day. A small yellow slip of paper attached to his file read: &quot;Sentence carried out.&quot; He was executed with a bullet to the back of the head at the Kommunarka shooting ground.

Pilnyak began to be rehabilitated and appreciated again in the USSR in the late 1960s and 1970s.

==Influence==

Pilnyak is generally considered the greatest Russian novelist of 1920s and was the second most read writer of that time, only behind Maxim Gorky. His modernist style of writing influenced a whole generation, not only Russian but also many Yugoslav writers, the most famous of them being Danilo Kiš, Dubravka Ugrešić and Miodrag Bulatovic among others. Kiš often cited Pilnyak as one of his main influences and one of his favourite Russian authors along with Yury Olesha and Isaac Babel.

<text>Myeongjong (8 November 1131 – 3 December 1202), personal name Wang Ho, was the 19th king of Korea&#x27;s Goryeo dynasty. He was the third son of King Injong. His reign marked the beginning of the century-long military rule of Korea known as the Goryeo military regime.

Although it was intended that King Injong&#x27;s second son should succeed his father, he was assassinated because Chŏng Chung-bu feared that he might become a threat to him in the future. Myeongjong was a weak puppet king, and was merely on the throne to show the general populace they still had a king, as the true rulers were the military leaders who had launched a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Myeongjong&#x27;s older brother and had established a military government. Despite this, Myeongjong did attempt to play off the military leaders against each other to both secure his own survival but also in an attempt to regain royal authority. His reign saw constant bloodshed as well as the deaths of the military rulers Chŏng Chung-bu, Yi Ŭi-bang, Kyŏng Tae-sŭng, and Yi Ŭi-min.

After twenty-seven years on the throne, he was sent into exile by the military ruler of the time, Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn. King Injong&#x27;s fifth son, King Sinjong, was placed on the throne.

He was wise, but like his brother before him had no true power, which was in the hands of Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn (this marked the beginning of the Choe family&#x27;s military rule). Sinjong&#x27;s reign was marked by waves of civil uprisings, such as rebellions and uprisings in Myeongju, Jinju, Geumju, Hapcheon, Gyeongju, and Gwangju. Sinjong also witnessed the kin strife of the Choe family and soon after became ill, abdicating in favor of his son King Huijong due to Choe&#x27;s demands.

<doc id="877100" wikidata="Q1743572" url="?curid=877100" title="Kirpal Singh">
<text>Kirpal Singh (6 February 1894 – 21 August 1974) was a spiritual master (&quot;satguru&quot;) in the tradition of Radha Soami.

Kirpal Singh was born in Sayyad Kasran, Punjab, in what is now Pakistan. He lived in Lahore during the period of his discipleship and attained a high position in the bureaucracy as a deputy comptroller of military accounts.

He was the President of the World Fellowship of Religions, an organization recognized by UNESCO, which had representatives from all the main religions of the world. Beginning with the publication of &quot;Gurmat Sidhant&quot;, authored by him in the late 1930s and published under his Guru&#x27;s name, during the period of his ministry he published many books and circulars that were translated into numerous languages.

The teaching of the Surat Shabd Yoga is a path of personal spiritual attainment under the guidance of a living spiritual master. The basic teachings consist in opening the inner eye or third eye to develop vision of inner light and inner sound. This is considered to be the power of the unmanifested Godhead coming into expression and is called &quot;Word&quot; in the Bible, and &quot;Naam&quot;, &quot;Shabd&quot;, &quot;Om&quot;, &quot;Kalma&quot;, and other names in the other scriptures. Kirpal Singh taught that the practice of meditation on the Divine Word, or the Yoga of the Sound Current (Surat Shabd Yoga) was at the spiritual base of all religions.

==Life==
From youth, Kirpal Singh had visionary experience and foreknowledge of events. He sought guidance from various sufis, yogis and mystics, but never accepted any of them as a master, and continued his spiritual practice and prayers for the guidance of a living teacher. In 1917, he began to see a spiritual form that he believed was Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh religion. In 1924, he met Hazur Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji, the famous Saint of the Beas, in his Ashram on the banks of the Beas River, and in him recognized the luminous form he had seen during the seven previous years. Hazur initiated him into Surat Shabd Yoga, and from then on Kirpal Singh dedicated his life to the mission of his spiritual Master and to his practices, while married, with children and in a responsible government position. Baba Sawan Singh Ji Maharaj asked him to meditate six hours daily, a practice which he maintained throughout his discipleship, despite his life responsibilities.

From early the 1930s on, when Hazur was asked if he had a disciple who had made great progress, he cited Kirpal Singh. In the same years, on inspiration from his master, Kirpal began writing the &quot;Gurmat Siddhant&quot; (&quot;The Philosophy of the Masters&quot;), a two-volume spiritual work, in the Punjabi and Urdu languages. It was published, on Kirpal request, under the name of Hazur Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. In the 1960s, it was published in English in five volumes. Ruhani Satsang published a number of books under Kirpal Singh&#x27;s name that were essentially portions of Gurmat Sidhant.

On the morning of 12 October 1947, Hazur Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji entrusted his disciple Kirpal Singh with the work of continuing his spiritual mission. The next month, Hazur approved the project of the &quot;Ruhani Satsang&quot; (School of Spirituality or Science of the Soul) Kirpal presented to him. Hazur Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji died on 2 April 1948, following a brief illness.

After his master&#x27;s passing, Kirpal went to Rishikesh at the foot of the Himalayan Mountains, where he spent the next five months in an almost continual state of samadhi, or absorption in God.

At the end of this period of intense meditation, Kirpal Singh received an inner command from his master: &quot;Return to the world and bring my children back to me.&quot; He moved to Delhi, where people from Punjab were looking for refuge because of the division from Pakistan, and there began his spiritual and humanitarian mission.

Kirpal initiated over 80,000 followers

==Ruhani Satsang==
In Delhi, Kirpal Singh founded his new school of spiritual research and realization, called Ruhani Satsang (School of Spirituality or Science of the Soul), which would go on to have branches in many nations of the world. In 1951 he built the Sawan Ashram, in the neighborhood of Shakti Nagar on the outskirts of the city, where his spiritual talks (satsangs) were soon followed by thousands of people.

He began to have visits from western disciples. The first was Rusel Jacque, whose account of his six months at the ashram in 1959 (Gurudev: the Lord of Compassion) encouraged others to make the journey. At the beginning of the sixties, an average 40 to 50 disciples stayed at the ashram from three weeks to six months.

==Vegetarianism==

The vegetarian Sattvic diet was an important part of Singh&#x27;s teachings. He recommended a simple lacto-vegetarian diet consisting of fruit, grains, nuts and vegetables with permitted dairy products for spiritual reasons. Meat, eggs and spices were strictly avoided as they were considered Rajsic and Tamsic foods. He argued against overfeeding.

==World Fellowship of Religions==
In 1957, Singh was elected the first president of the World Fellowship of Religions, an organization recognized by UNESCO, comprising representatives from all the major world religions. He held that position until 1971, and presided over four World Conferences.

In 1962, he became the first non-Christian to receive the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem (Knights of Malta) for his spiritual and humanitarian work. On this occasion he received the congratulations of India&#x27;s prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and established a spiritual tie with him that continued with prime ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi.

==World tour==
===First tour===
Singh&#x27;s mission continued to grow rapidly. In 1955, he made his first trip abroad to spread his teachings, and spent months in the United States and Europe. It was the first time an Indian spiritual master had visited the West. In those years, Eastern spiritual practices were generally unfamiliar to the West. Singh had hundreds of Westerners initiated and placed on the path of meditation, which he claimed led to contact with the Divine Light and Harmony.

In 1963, Singh made his second world tour, this time as president of the World Fellowship of Religions. He met with political leaders and other religious leaders, including Pope Paul VI and the Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Churches Atenagora I. At the same time, he continued to instruct new seekers on the path of the Way of the Masters (Sant Mat).

On 26 August 1972, Kirpal Singh conducted his third and final tour of the West, where he received and instructed more than 2000 new disciples of the Path of Spirituality.

==Final year==

In Delhi in February 1974, Singh organized the World Conference on Unity of Man. More than 2000 delegates attended, including religious and political leaders from India and around the world. Over 100,000 people attended the conference in total.

At the Kumba Mela (Festival of Religions) in Haridwar on 2 April of the same year, Singh gathered sadhus (itinerant monks) and &quot;saintly men&quot; in the Conference of National Unity, with the aims of promoting cooperation, eliminating religious barriers, and bettering the economic status of India&#x27;s poor.

In 1974 Kirpal Singh established the Unity of Man conference, which was intended as a platform to bring together both religious and political leaders towards finding common ground and improved relations. This conference, under the name, Human Unity Conference, continues to this day.

==Legacy and succession==

Kirpal Singh died on 21 August 1974 at the age of eighty. His death caused a succession dispute amongst his followers. 

There is Pier Franco Marcenaro, who, after his Initiation in January 1968, was his Group Leader and Representative in Milan, Italy, and is today a recognized successor by many disciples organized in an association called &quot;The School of Spirituality&quot;.

In 1963, Kirpal Singh had declared that he knew of no one competent to be his successor. Then He stated most forcefully: &quot;Whoever may come up in the future, I tell you most definitely that he will NOT be a member of my family!&quot;

These succession disputes ultimately led to the proliferation of satsangs without connection to any descendant of the Singh tradition. As of 2002, there were approximately 200,000 adherents of groups related to Kirpal Singh.

==Available teachings==
Kirpal Singh wrote an extensive collection of books on spirituality, including &quot;The Crown of Life&quot; (a comparative study of various religions and yogas); &quot;Prayer, Its Nature and Technique&quot;; &quot;Spirituality: What It Is&quot;; &quot;Godman&quot; (on finding a spiritual teacher or guru), and &quot;The Wheel of Life&quot; (on karma).

PDF versions of Kirpal Singh&#x27;s books are available free online., as are MP3 recordings of many of his talks in English and Hindi / Punjabi.

<doc id="877103" wikidata="Q753298" url="?curid=877103" title="Uncle Vanya">
<text>Uncle Vanya () is a play by the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. It was first published in 1897, and first produced in 1899 by the Moscow Art Theatre, directed by Konstantin Stanislavski.

The play portrays the visit of an elderly professor and his glamorous, much younger second wife, Yelena, to the rural estate that supports their urban lifestyle. Two friends—Vanya, brother of the professor&#x27;s late first wife, who has long managed the estate, and Astrov, the local doctor—both fall under Yelena&#x27;s spell while bemoaning the ennui of their provincial existence. Sonya, the professor&#x27;s daughter by his first wife, who has worked with Vanya to keep the estate going, suffers from her unrequited feelings for Astrov. Matters are brought to a crisis when the professor announces his intention to sell the estate, Vanya and Sonya&#x27;s home, with a view to investing the proceeds to achieve a higher income for himself and his wife.

== Background ==
&quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; is unique among Chekhov&#x27;s major plays because it is essentially an extensive reworking of &quot;The Wood Demon&quot;, a play he published a decade earlier. By elucidating the specific changes Chekhov made during the revision process—these include reducing the cast from almost two dozen down to nine, changing the climactic suicide of &quot;The Wood Demon&quot; into the famous failed homicide of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, and altering the original happy ending into an ambiguous, less final resolution—critics such as Donald Rayfield, Richard Gilman, and Eric Bentley have sought to chart the development of Chekhov&#x27;s dramaturgical method through the 1890s.

Rayfield cites recent scholarship suggesting Chekhov revised &quot;The Wood Demon&quot; during his trip to the island of Sakhalin, a prison colony in Eastern Russia, in 1891. 

== Characters and cast ==
* Aleksandr Vladimirovich Serebryakov (): a retired university professor, who has lived for years in the city on the earnings of his late first wife&#x27;s rural estate, managed for him by Vanya and Sonya.

At Professor Serebryakov&#x27;s country estate, Astrov and Marina discuss how old Astrov has grown and his boredom with life as a country doctor. Vanya enters and complains of the disruption caused by the visit of Serebryakov and his wife, Yelena. Serebryakov, Yelena, Sonya, and Telegin return from a walk. Out of earshot of Serebryakov, Vanya calls him &quot;a learned old dried mackerel&quot; and belittles his achievements. Vanya&#x27;s mother, Maria Vasilyevna, who idolizes Serebryakov, objects. Vanya also praises Yelena&#x27;s beauty, arguing that faithfulness to an old man like Serebryakov is an immoral waste of vitality.

Astrov is forced to depart to attend to a patient, after making a speech on the preservation of the forests, a subject he is passionate about. Vanya declares his love to an exasperated Yelena.

=== Act II ===
Several days later. Before going to bed, Serebryakov complains of pain and old age. Astrov arrives but the professor refuses to see him. After Serebryakov falls asleep, Yelena and Vanya talk. She speaks of the discord in the house, and Vanya speaks of dashed hopes. He feels that he has misspent his youth and he associates his unrequited love for Yelena with the disappointment of his life. Yelena refuses to listen. Vanya believed in Serebryakov&#x27;s greatness and was happy to support Serebryakov&#x27;s work; he has become disillusioned with the professor and his life feels empty. Astrov returns and the two talk. Sonya chides Vanya for his drinking, and points out that only work is truly fulfilling.

A storm starts and Astrov talks to Sonya about the house&#x27;s suffocating atmosphere; he says Serebryakov is difficult, Vanya is a hypochondriac, and Yelena is charming but idle. Sonya begs Astrov to stop drinking, telling him it is unworthy of him. It becomes clear that Sonya is in love with him and that he is unaware of her feelings.

Astrov leaves; Yelena enters and makes peace with Sonya, after mutual antagonism. Yelena reassures Sonya that she had strong feelings for Serebryakov when she married him, though that has proved illusory. Yelena confesses her unhappiness, and Sonya eulogises Astrov. In a happy mood, Sonya goes to ask the professor if Yelena may play the piano. Sonya returns with his negative answer.

=== Act III ===

Vanya, Sonya, and Yelena have been called together by Serebryakov. Vanya urges Yelena, once again, to break free. Sonya complains to Yelena that she has loved Astrov for years but he doesn&#x27;t notice her. Yelena volunteers to question Astrov and find out if he is in love with Sonya. Sonya is pleased, but wonders whether uncertainty is better than knowledge.

When Yelena asks Astrov about his feelings for Sonya, he says he has none, thinking that Yelena has brought up the subject of love to encourage him to confess his own feelings for her. Astrov kisses Yelena, and Vanya sees them. Upset, Yelena begs Vanya to use his influence to allow her and the professor to leave immediately. Yelena tells Sonya that Astrov doesn&#x27;t love her.

Serebryakov proposes to solve the family&#x27;s financial problems by selling the estate and investing the proceeds, which will bring in a significantly higher income (and, he hopes, leave enough over to buy a villa for himself and Yelena in Finland). Angrily, Vanya asks where he, Sonya, and his mother would live, protests that the estate rightly belongs to Sonya, and that Serebryakov has never appreciated his self-sacrifice in managing the property. Vanya begins to rage against the professor, blaming him for his own failures, wildly claiming that, without Serebryakov to hold him back, he could have been a second Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky. He cries out to his mother, but Maria insists that Vanya listen to the professor. Serebryakov insults Vanya, who storms out. Yelena begs to be taken away, and Sonya pleads with her father on Vanya&#x27;s behalf. Serebryakov exits to confront Vanya further. A shot is heard from offstage and Serebryakov returns, chased by Vanya, wielding a pistol. He fires again at the professor, but misses. He throws the gun down in self-disgust.

=== Act IV ===
A few hours later, Marina and Telegin discuss the planned departure of Serebryakov and Yelena. Vanya and Astrov enter, Astrov saying that in this district, only he and Vanya were &quot;decent, cultured men&quot; and that years of &quot;narrow-minded life&quot; have made them vulgar. Vanya has stolen a vial of Astrov&#x27;s morphine, presumably to commit suicide; Sonya and Astrov beg him to return it, which he eventually does.

Yelena and Serebryakov bid farewell. When Yelena says goodbye to Astrov, she embraces him, and takes one of his pencils as a souvenir. Serebryakov and Vanya make their peace, agreeing all will be as it was before. Once the outsiders have departed, Sonya and Vanya settle accounts, Maria reads a pamphlet, and Marina knits. Vanya complains of the heaviness of his heart, and Sonya, in response, speaks of living, working, and the rewards of the afterlife: &quot;And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress…. You&#x27;ve had no joy in your life; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait…. We shall rest.&quot;

== Productions ==

Although the play had previous small runs in provincial theatres in 1898, its metropolitan première took place on at the Moscow Art Theatre. Constantin Stanislavski played the role of Astrov while Chekhov&#x27;s future wife Olga Knipper played Yelena. The initial reviews were favorable but pointed to defects in both the play and the performances. As the staging and the acting improved over successive performances, and as &quot;the public understood better its inner meaning and nuances of feeling&quot;, the reviews improved. &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; became a permanent fixture in the Moscow Art Theatre.

The play was adapted as the stage-play &quot;Dear Uncle&quot; by the British playwright Alan Ayckbourn, who reset it in the 1930s Lake District. This adaptation premiered from July to September 2011 at the Stephen Joseph Theatre.

In January 2014 24/6: A Jewish Theater Company performed &quot;TuBishVanya&quot;, a modern adaptation that incorporated Jewish and environmental themes.

In 2023, an off-off-Broadway production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; performed in an unmarked Manhattan loft for an audience of 40. Directed by Jack Serio and using a translation by Paul Schmidt, the cast featured Will Brill as Astrov, Julia Chan as Yelena, David Cromer as Vanya, Will Dagger as Telegin, Marin Ireland as Sonya, Bill Irwin as Serebryakov (replaced by Thomas Jay Ryan), Virginia Wing as Marina, Ann McDonough as Maria, and Nathan Malin as Yefim.

Among the actors who have played Uncle Vanya on Broadway are Ralph Richardson, Nicol Williamson, Tom Courtenay, and Derek Jacobi. Since April 2024, a Broadway production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; has been staged in the Vivian Beaumont Theater by director Lila Neugebauer. The cast includes Steve Carell as Uncle Vanya, Allison Pill as Sonya, William Jackson Harper as Astrov, Alfred Molina as Alexander Serabryakov, Anika Noni Rose as Yelena, Jonathan Hadary as Telegin/&quot;Waffles,&quot; Jayne Houdyshell as Mama Voinitski, and Mia Katigbak as Marina.

Other actors who have appeared in notable stage productions of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; include Michael Redgrave, Paul Scofield, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Albert Finney, Franchot Tone, Cate Blanchett, Peter Dinklage, Jacki Weaver, Antony Sher, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Simon Russell Beale, William Hurt, George C. Scott, Donald Sinden, Michael Gambon, Trevor Eve, and Laurence Olivier.

<doc id="877112" wikidata="Q478381" url="?curid=877112" title="The Cherry Orchard">
<text>The Cherry Orchard () is the last play by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. Written in 1903, it was first published by &quot;Znaniye&quot; (Book Two, 1904), and came out as a separate edition later that year in Saint Petersburg, via A.F. Marks Publishers. On 17 January 1904, it opened at the Moscow Art Theatre in a production directed by Konstantin Stanislavski. Chekhov described the play as a comedy, with some elements of farce, though Stanislavski treated it as a tragedy. Since its first production, directors have contended with its dual nature. It is often identified as one of the four outstanding plays by Chekhov, along with &quot;The Seagull&quot;, &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;.

The play revolves around an aristocratic Russian landowner who returns to her family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. Unresponsive to offers to save the estate, she allows its sale to the son of a former serf; the family leaves to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down. The story presents themes of cultural futility – both the futile attempts of the aristocracy to maintain its status and of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its new-found materialism. It dramatizes the socioeconomic forces in Russia at the turn of the 20th century, including the rise of the middle class after the abolition of serfdom in the mid-19th century and the decline of the power of the aristocracy.

Widely regarded as a classic of 20th-century theatre, the play has been translated and adapted into many languages and produced around the world. Major theatre directors have staged it, including Charles Laughton, Peter Brook, Andrei Șerban, Jean-Louis Barrault, Tyrone Guthrie, Katie Mitchell, Robert Falls, and Giorgio Strehler. It has influenced many other playwrights, including Eugene O&#x27;Neill, George Bernard Shaw, David Mamet, and Arthur Miller.

==Characters==
The spelling of character names depends on the transliteration used.

* Madame Lyubov Andreievna Ranevskaya – a landowner. Ranyevskaya is the linchpin around which the other characters revolve. A commanding and popular figure, she represents the pride of the old aristocracy, now fallen on hard times. Her confused feelings of love for her old home and sorrow at the scene of her son&#x27;s death, give her an emotional depth that keeps her from devolving into a mere aristocratic grotesque. Most of her humor comes from her inability to understand financial or business matters.
* Peter Trofimov – a student and Anya&#x27;s friend. Trofimov is depicted as an &quot;eternal&quot; (in some translations, &quot;wandering&quot;) student. An impassioned left-wing political commentator, he represents the rising tide of reformist political opinion in Russia, which struggled to find its place within the authoritarian Czarist autocracy.
* Boris Borisovich Simeonov-Pishchik – a landowner and another old aristocrat whose estate has hit hard times. He is constantly discussing new business ventures that may save him and badgering Ranyevskaya for a loan. His character embodies the irony of the aristocracy&#x27;s position: despite his financial peril, he spends the play relaxing and socializing with the Gayevs.
* Anya – Lyubov&#x27;s daughter, aged seventeen. She journeys to Paris to rescue her mother from her desperate situation. She is a virtuous and strong young woman. She is close to Trofimov and listens to his revolutionary ideas, although she may or may not be taking them in.
* Varya – Lyubov&#x27;s adopted daughter, aged twenty-four. Varya is the one who manages the estate and keeps everything in order. She is the rock that holds the family together. The reason why Ranevskaya adopted her is never made clear, although she is mentioned to have come from &quot;simple people&quot; (most likely serfs). Varya fantasizes about becoming a nun, though she lacks the financial means to do so. She adores her mother and sister and frets about money constantly. Her relationship with Lopakhin is a mysterious one; everyone in the play assumes that they are about to be married, but neither of them acts on it.
* Leonid Andreieveitch Gayev – the brother of Madame Ranevskaya. One of the more obvious comic characters, Gayev is a talkative eccentric. His addiction to billiards (often manifesting itself at times of discomfort) is symbolic of the aristocracy&#x27;s decadent life of leisure, which renders them impotent in the face of change. Gayev tries hard to save his family and estate, but ultimately, as an aristocrat, he either lacks the drive or doesn&#x27;t understand the real-world mechanisms necessary to realize his goals.
* Yermolai Alexeievitch Lopakhin – a merchant. Lopakhin is by far the wealthiest character in the play, but comes from the lowest social class, as his father was a peasant and his grandfather was a serf. This contrast defines his character: he enjoys living the high life, but at the same time is uncomfortably conscious of his low beginnings and obsession with business. He is often portrayed on stage as an unpleasant character because of his greedy tendencies and ultimate betrayal of the Gayev family, but there is nothing in the play to suggest this: he works strenuously to help the Gayevs but to no avail. Lopakhin represents the new middle class in Russia, one of many threats to the old aristocratic way of doing things.
* Charlotta Ivanovna – a governess. By far the most eccentric character, Charlotta is the only governess the Gayevs can afford and is a companion for Anya. She is a melancholy figure, raised by a German woman without any real knowledge of who her circus entertainer parents were. She performs card tricks and ventriloquism at the party in the third act and accepts the loss of her station when the family disbands with pragmatism.
* Yepikhodov – a clerk. The Gayev&#x27;s estate clerk is another source of comedy. He is unfortunate and clumsy in the extreme, earning him the insulting nickname &quot;Twenty-Two Calamities&quot; (the nickname varies between translations) mostly invoked by Yasha. He considers himself to be in love with Dunyasha, whom he has asked to marry him.
* Dunyasha – a housemaid. Like Lopakhin, she is another example of social mobility in Russia at the time. A peasant who is employed as the Gayev&#x27;s chambermaid, Dunyasha is an attention seeker, making big scenes and dressing as a lady to show herself off. She is in some respects representative of the aristocracy&#x27;s impotence, as a lowly chambermaid would not in the past have had the freedom to dress like a lady and flirt with the menservants. Although pursued romantically by Yepikhodov, she is in love with Yasha, attracted to the culture he has picked up in Paris.
* Firs – a manservant, aged 87. An aging eccentric, Firs considers the emancipation of the Russian serfs a disaster and talks nostalgically of the old days when everybody admired their masters and owners, such as Gayev&#x27;s parents and grandparents. His senility is a source of much of the play&#x27;s poignancy, symbolizing the decay of the old order into muttering madness.
* Yasha – a young manservant, accompanying Lyubov on her way back from Paris and desperate to return. Yasha represents the new, disaffected Russian generation, who dislike the staid old ways and who will be the footsoldiers of the revolution. A rude, inconsiderate and predatory young man, Yasha, like Dunyasha and Charlotta, is the best the Gayevs can afford. He toys with the girlish affections of Dunyasha, the maid.
* A Stranger – a passer-by who encounters the Gayevs as they laze around on their estate during Act II. He is symbolic of the intrusion of new ideologies and social movements that infringed on the aristocracy&#x27;s peace in Russia at the turn of the 20th century.
* The Stationmaster and The Postmaster – Both officials attend the Gayevs&#x27; party in Act III. Although they both play minor roles (the Stationmaster attempts to recite a poem, and the Postmaster flirts with Dunyasha), they are mostly symbols of the deprecation of the aristocracy in 1900s Russia – Firs comments that, whereas once they had barons and lords at the ball, now it&#x27;s the postman and the stationmaster, and even they come only to be polite.
* Grisha – The son of Lyubov, drowned many years ago before her sojourn to Paris. She is reminded of his existence through the presence of Trofimov, who was his tutor.
* Guests, servants, and others.

==Plot==
===Act 1===
The play opens on a day in May in the nursery of Lyubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya&#x27;s home in the provinces of Russia, at the start of the 20th century. Ranevskaya has been living in France since her young son drowned. After she had tried to kill herself, Ranevskaya&#x27;s 17-year-old daughter Anya and Anya&#x27;s governess Charlotta Ivanovna have brought her home to Russia, accompanied by Yasha, Ranevskaya&#x27;s valet. Upon returning, they are met by Lopakhin, Dunyasha, Varya (who has overseen the estate in Ranevskaya&#x27;s absence), Ranevskaya&#x27;s brother Gayev, Boris Simeonov-Pishchik, Semyon Yepikhodov, and Firs.

Lopakhin has come to remind Ranevskaya and Gayev that their estate, including the cherry orchard, will be auctioned soon to pay off the family&#x27;s debts. He proposes to save the estate by allowing part of it to be developed into summer cottages; however, this would require the destruction of the cherry orchard, which is nationally known for its size.

Ranevskaya is enjoying the view of the orchard as day breaks, when she is surprised by Peter Trofimov, a young student and former tutor of Ranevskaya&#x27;s dead son, Grisha. Trofimov had insisted on seeing Ranevskaya upon her return, and she is grief-stricken at the reminder of this tragedy. After Ranevskaya retires for the evening, Anya confesses to Varya that their mother is heavily in debt. They all go to bed with the hope that the estate will be saved and the cherry orchard preserved. Trofimov stares after the departing Anya in adoration.

===Act 2===
Act II takes place outdoors near the orchard. Yepikhodov and Yasha vie for the affection of Dunyasha by singing and playing guitar while Charlotta soliloquizes about her life. In Act I it was revealed that Yepikhodov proposed to Dunyasha at Easter; however, she has become infatuated with the more &quot;cultured&quot; Yasha. Charlotta leaves so that Dunyasha and Yasha might have some time alone, but that is interrupted when they hear their employer coming. Yasha shoos Dunyasha away to avoid being caught, and Ranevskaya, Gayev, and Lopakhin appear, once more discussing the uncertain fate of the cherry orchard. Soon Anya, Varya, and Trofimov arrive as well. Lopakhin teases Trofimov for being a perpetual student, and Trofimov espouses his philosophy of work and useful purpose, to the delight and humour of everyone around. During their conversations, a disheveled beggar passes by; Ranevskaya gives him all her money, despite his protestations of Varya. Shaken by the disturbance, the family departs for dinner. Anya stays behind to talk with Trofimov, who disapproves of Varya, reassuring Anya that they are &#x27;above love&#x27;. To impress Trofimov, Anya vows to leave the past behind her and start a new life. The two depart for the river as Varya calls in the background.

===Act 3===
It is the end of August, and Ranevskaya&#x27;s party is held. Musicians play as the family and guests drink and entertain themselves. It is also the day of the auction; Gayev has received a paltry amount of money from his and Ranevskaya&#x27;s aunt, and the family members, despite the general merriment around them, are anxious while they wait for news. Varya worries about paying the musicians and scolds their neighbor Pishchik for drinking, Dunyasha for dancing, and Yepikhodov for playing billiards. Charlotta performs magic tricks. Ranevskaya scolds Trofimov for his teasing of Varya, whom he refers to as &quot;Madame Lopakhin&quot;. She then urges Varya to marry Lopakhin, but Varya demurs, reminding her that it is Lopakhin&#x27;s duty to ask for her hand in marriage, not the other way around. She says that if she had money she would move as far away as possible. Alone with Ranevskaya, Trofimov insists that she finally face the fact that the house and orchard will be sold at auction. Ranevskaya shows him a telegram she has received and reveals that her former lover is ill and has begged her to return to Paris. She is seriously considering this, despite his cruel behaviour to her in the past. Trofimov is stunned at this; they argue about the nature of love and their respective experiences. Trofimov leaves, but falls down the stairs off-stage and is carried in by the others. Ranevskaya laughs and forgives him for his folly and the two reconcile. Anya enters with a rumour that the estate has been sold. Lopakhin arrives with Gayev, both of them exhausted from the trip and the day&#x27;s events. Gayev is distant and goes to bed without saying a word of the outcome of the auction. When Ranevskaya asks who bought the estate, Lopakhin reveals that he is the purchaser, and intends to chop down the orchard. Ranevskaya, distraught, clings to Anya, who reassures her that the future will be better now.

===Act 4===
Several weeks later the family&#x27;s belongings are being packed as the family prepares to leave the estate. Trofimov enters, and he and Lopakhin exchange opposing world views. Lopakhin does not propose to Varya. Anya enters and reprimands Lopakhin for ordering his workers to begin chopping down the cherry orchard while the family is still there; Lopakhin apologises and rushes out to stop them for the time being, in the hopes that he will be somehow reconciled with the family. Charlotta enters, lost and in a daze, and insists that the family find her a new position. Ranevskaya bids her old life goodbye and leaves as the house is shut up forever. In the gloom, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He lies down and resigns himself to this fate. The sound of axes cutting down trees is heard off-stage.

==Themes==
One of the main themes of the play is the effect social change has on people. The emancipation of the serfs on 19 February 1861 by Alexander II allowed former serfs to gain wealth and status while some aristocrats were becoming impoverished, unable to tend their estates without the cheap labor of slavery. The effect of these reforms was still being felt when Chekhov was writing forty years after the mass emancipation.

Chekhov originally intended the play as a comedy (indeed, the title page of the work refers to it as such), and in letters noted that it is, in places, almost farcical. When he saw the original Moscow Art Theatre production directed by Konstantin Stanislavski, he was horrified to find that the director had moulded the play into a tragedy. Ever since that time, productions have had to struggle with this dual nature of the play (and of Chekhov&#x27;s works in general).
Ranevskaya&#x27;s failure to address the problems facing her estate and family means that she eventually loses almost everything, and her fate can be seen as a criticism of those people who are unwilling to adapt to the new Russia. Her petulant refusal to accept the truth of her past, in both life and love, is her downfall throughout the play. She ultimately runs between her life in Paris and in Russia (she arrives from Paris at the start of the play and returns there afterwards). She is a woman who lives in an illusion of the past (often reliving memories about her son&#x27;s death, etc.). The speeches by the student Trofimov, attacking intellectuals were later seen as early manifestations of Bolshevik ideas and his lines were often censored by the Tsarist officials. Cherry trees themselves are often seen as symbols of sadness or regret at the passing away of a certain situation or of the times in general.

The idea of independence and freedom is relevant to the positions of Firs and Lopakhin. Firs has been with the estate for decades, and all he has ever known is to serve his masters. When the news of the orchard being sold breaks, Firs seems unfazed, and continues to carry out his duties, but is unable to find his independence and freedom; Lopakhin was able to &quot;free&quot; himself, in the sense that he was able to find motivation to keep on going. Even though the two are polar opposites on the social ladder, they both have internal struggles regarding what their life is going to be after the orchard is chopped down.

==Production history==
=== Theatre ===

==== Initial 1904 production ====
The play opened on 17 January 1904, the director&#x27;s birthday, at the Moscow Art Theatre under the direction of the actor-director Konstantin Stanislavski. During rehearsals, the structure of act two was re-written. Famously contrary to Chekhov&#x27;s wishes, Stanislavski&#x27;s version was, by and large, a tragedy. Chekhov disliked the Stanislavski production intensely, concluding that Stanislavski had &quot;ruined&quot; his play. In one of many letters on the subject, Chekhov would complain, &quot;Anya, I fear, should not have any sort of tearful tone ... Not once does my Anya cry, and nowhere do I speak of a tearful tone; in the second act, there are tears in their eyes, but the tone is happy and lively. Why did you speak in your telegram about so many tears in my play? Where are they? ... Often you will find the words &quot;through tears,&quot; but I am describing only the expression on their faces, not tears. And in the second act there is no graveyard.&quot; The playwright&#x27;s wife Olga Knipper played Madame Ranevskaya in the original Moscow Art Theatre production, as well as in the 300th production of the play by the theatre in 1943.

Although critics at the time were divided in their response to the play, the debut was a resounding theatrical success, and the play was almost immediately presented in many of the important provincial cities. This success was not confined only to Russia, as the play was soon seen abroad with great acclaim as well. Shortly after the play&#x27;s debut, Chekhov departed for Germany due to his worsening health, and by July 1904, he was dead.

The modest and newly urbanized audiences attending pre-revolutionary performances at S. V. Panin&#x27;s People&#x27;s House in Saint Petersburg reportedly cheered as the cherry orchard was felled on stage.
==== Other productions in the 20th century ====
*The first performance in English was given on 28 May 1911 by the Stage Society at the Aldwych Theatre, London, in a translation by Constance Garnett. The director was Kenelm Foss and the cast included Edmund Breon (Yasha), Herbert Bunston (Lopakhin), Franklin Dyall (Gaev), Mary Jerrold (Varya), Nigel Playfair (Simeonov-Pishchik) and Harcourt Williams (Trofimov).
*The Moscow Art company took the play to Paris in 1922, and to Broadway in 1923–24. The author&#x27;s widow, Olga Knipper-Tchekhova, played Ranevskaya and Stanislavsky played Gaev.
*A production by J. B. Fagan, first seen at the Oxford Playhouse, transferred to the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, and then the Royalty Theatre, London, where it ran for more than 120 performances. Among the cast were the young John Gielgud as Trofimov, Glen Byam Shaw as Yasha, and O. B. Clarence and later Richard Goolden as Firs.
*Fagan took his production to Broadway in 1928 – the first production in English in the US. It opened at the Bijou Theatre in March, for a limited season of matinees.
*Tyrone Guthrie&#x27;s production at the Old Vic in October 1933, using Hubert Butler&#x27;s new, colloquial translation, emphasised the comic aspects of the play. The cast was headed by Athene Seyler as Ranevskaya, with Ursula Jeans (Anya), Charles Laughton (Lopakhin), Roger Livesey (Simeonov-Pishchik), Leon Quartermaine (Gaev) and Flora Robson (Varya).
*The first production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) was in December 1961 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, later transferring to the Aldwych. Michel Saint-Denis directed Gielgud&#x27;s translation of the play, with a cast including Peggy Ashcroft (Ranevskaya), Gielgud (Gaev), Dorothy Tutin (Varya), Judi Dench (Anya), Paul Hardwick (Simeonov-Pishchik), Ian Holm (Trofimov), Patrick Wymark (Yepikhodov) and Roy Dotrice (Firs).
* The Stratford Festival of Canada mounted productions in 1965, 1987, and 1998. The 1965 production was the first time that a Chekhov play had been performed there. Furthermore, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; marked the Stratford directorial debut of John Hirsch. Three of the original Stratford company members were in the cast: William Hutt as Gaev, Douglas Campbell as Lopakhin, and William Needles in the role of Yepihodov. The cast featured Frances Hyland as Varya, Kate Reid as Ranevskaya, and Martha Henry as Dunyasha, Powys Thomas as Fiers, Mervyn Blake as Pishtchik and Bruno Gerussi as Yasha.
*The first production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; by the National Theatre in London was at the Old Vic in May 1973 in a translation by Ronald Hingley. The director was Michael Blakemore; the cast included Constance Cummings (Ranevskaya), Michael Hordern (Gaev) and Denis Quilley (Lopakhin).
* A production starring Irene Worth as Ranevskaya, Raul Julia as Lopakhin, Mary Beth Hurt as Anya, and Meryl Streep as Dunyasha, directed by Andrei Șerban and featuring Tony Award–winning costumes and set by Santo Loquasto, opened at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1977.
* A production directed by Peter Hall, translated by Michael Frayn with Dorothy Tutin as Ranevskaya, Robert Stephens as Gaev, Albert Finney as Lopakhin, Terence Rigby as Simeonov-Pishchik, Ben Kingsley as Trofimov, and Ralph Richardson (later Robin Bailey) as Firs, appeared at the National Theatre in London in 1978. A minimalist production directed by Peter Gill with a cast including Judy Parfitt as Ranevskaya, Stephen Rea as Trofimov, and Julie Covington as Varya opened at the Riverside Studios in London also in 1978.
* In 1981, Peter Brook mounted a production in French &quot;(La Cérisaie)&quot; with an international cast including Brook&#x27;s wife Natasha Parry as Ranevskaya, Niels Arestrup as Lopakhin, and Michel Piccoli as Gayev. The production was remounted at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1988 after tours through Africa and the Middle East.
*Mike Alfreds was both translator and director for a production at the National Theatre in December 1985. The cast included Sheila Hancock (Ranyevskaya), Edward Petherbridge (Gaev), Ian McKellen (Lopakhin), Eleanor Bron (Varya), Roy Kinnear (Simeonov-Pishchik) and Hugh Lloyd (Firs). 
* The Stratford Festival&#x27;s 1987 production also used the Trevor Griffiths text, and subtly shifted the play&#x27;s emphasis from Madame Ranyevskaya&#x27;s economic demise to the ascent of Lopakhin. James Blendick as Lopakhin was praised for his skilful man-on-the-rise performance. The 1998 festival production, directed by Diana Leblanc, was based on a new translation by John Murell. Among its cast were Martha Henry as Ranevskaya and Stephen Russell as Leonid. &quot;Variety&quot; commented: &quot;Leblanc has ... remembered that this is a tragicomedy ... avoided the obvious and encouraged her actors to find humor rather than high drama. It works beautifully because there is drama aplenty in merely playing these characters with integrity.&quot; 
* A Welsh language version &quot;Y Gelli Geirios&quot; translated by W. Gareth Jones was performed for the first time on 19 February 1991 by Cwmni Theatr Gwynedd in Theatr Gwynedd, Bangor.
*The RSC&#x27;s second production of the play was in July 1995 at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon and later at the Albery Theatre, London, using the translation by Gill. Adrian Noble directed a cast including Penelope Wilton (Ranevskaya), Alec McCowen (Gaev), David Troughton (Lopakhin) and Peter Copley (Firs).

==== 21st century ====

* The Steppenwolf Theatre Company (Chicago, Illinois) performed a version that was translated by its Associate Artistic Director, Curt Columbus, and directed by ensemble member Tina Landau. The play premiered on 4 November 2004 and ran until 5 March 2005 at the Upstairs Theatre.

<text>Sierra National Forest is a U.S. national forest located on the western slope of the central Sierra Nevada in California, bounded on the northwest by Yosemite National Park and on the south by Kings Canyon National Park. The forest is known for its mountain scenery and beautiful lakes. Forest headquarters are located in Clovis, California. There are local ranger district offices in North Fork and Prather.

==History==
Sierra National Forest was the second National Forest created in California and the largest at the time. It covered over six million acres (24,000 km2) of the Sierra Nevada and was about four times the average area of typical California National Forests. Originally it embraced parts of eight counties from Tuolumne on the north to Kern on the south and Mono and Inyo on the east. Initially its name was descriptive, but later when the Sierra was divided into different units this was no longer the case.

President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed the Sierra Forest Reserve on February 14, 1893. Four years later the south half became a separate unit and was named Sierra South during the &quot;forest reserves&quot; era. This designation was dropped after the administrative transition to the National Forests on March 4, 1907. On July 1, 1908, the Sequoia National Forest, and Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks were established from this south portion of Sierra National Forest. Eastern portions of Sierra National Forest became the Inyo and Toiyabe National Forests; northern portions were used for Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest.

The Sierra National Forest contains artifacts dating back over 10,000 years, mainly from indigenous people before written records started about 150 years ago. Around the late 1700s, the Fresno River marked the area between the Southern Sierra Miwok and the Chukchansi Yokuts, with the Western Mono living near today&#x27;s Bass Lake. The borders between these groups were not clear-cut, showing that the Miwok, Yokuts, and Mono territories often overlapped.

The first timber sale on a California National Forest took place in the Sierra NF by the United States General Land Office in 1899.

==Geography==

Sierra National Forest covers, in descending order of forestland area, the eastern portions of Fresno, Madera, and Mariposa counties, adjacent to the southern part of Yosemite National Park. It includes more than , at altitudes ranging from in elevation. The terrain includes rolling, oak-covered foothills, heavily forested middle elevation slopes and the tundra landscape of the High Sierra.

===Boundaries===
The forest&#x27;s boundary starts clockwise at the intersections of the Merced River, Sweetwater Creek and HWY 140, then moves east following the Merced River canyon to the border with Yosemite National Park near El Portal. Then it follows the park&#x27;s southern boundary until it reaches the Inyo National forest near Electra Peak. From there it travels south to its border with Kings Canyon National Park near Mount Goethe. It follows the park&#x27;s northern border, then heads south to the Kings River near Deer Canyon. From there it moves down the Kings River canyon east; south of the river is the Sequoia National Forest. When it reaches Pine Flat Lake near Trimmer, it turns north towards Tollhouse and continues on to Auberry. From there Sierra National Forest moves on to North Fork, then west to form a small finger towards Coarsegold. Finally, the boundary travels north to Yosemite Forks and moves west towards Miami Mountain, then heads north to return to the Merced River.

==Recreation==
The forest includes a number of scenic attractions, including Fresno Dome and Nelder Grove. Several reservoirs offer fishing and boating, including Bass Lake, Shaver Lake, Wishon Reservoir, and Courtright Reservoir. There are numerous hiking opportunities in wilderness areas: Ansel Adams, John Muir, Dinkey Lakes, Kaiser, and Monarch. There is also a ski resort, China Peak, that operates under a special use permit. Great sailing opportunities exist at Huntington Lake.

==Administration==
The Sierra National Forest is located within the Pacific Southwest region of the US Forest Service. The forest is divided into three ranger districts:

Bass Lake Ranger District is north and west of the San Joaquin River. Its Ranger District office is located at 57003 Road 225 North Fork, California, 93643. The district includes 36 camp sites, 17 picnic sites, 7 Off Highway Vehicle Trails, and 10 trails. It includes the Forest Service Offices of Oakhurst (40343 Hwy 41, Oakhurst, California 93644), and the Clover Meadow Wilderness Office.

High Sierra Ranger District is south and east of the San Joaquin River; it has its Ranger District office out of 29688 Auberry Rd P.O. Box 559 Prather, California 93651. This district contains 30 camp sites, 11 picnic sites, and 13 Off Highway Vehicle Trails. It also includes the following Forest Service Offices; the High Sierra visitor information station near Mono Hot Springs on the Kaiser Pass Road, Eastwood visitor information center at Hwy 168 and Kaiser Pass Road at Huntington Lake, Dinkey Creek visitor information center on Dinkey Creek Road near the Dinkey Creek Campground,

Supervisor&#x27;s Office (an administrative Unit) contains the Sierra National Forest Supervisor&#x27;s office (1600 Tollhouse Rd Clovis, California, 93611); the Yosemite Sierra Visitor Bureau (40343 Highway 41, Oakhurst, California 93644); and the Fresno Air Attack Base which is co-located with the Sierra National Forest Emergency Communications Center (2307 and 2309 N Clovis Ave, Fresno, California 93727) at Fresno Yosemite International Airport.

In addition, the forest has a close relationship with the Teakettle Experimental Forest which is deep inside the forest and the San Joaquin Experimental Range which is just outside the forest boundaries. They both fall in the Pacific Southwest Research Station which is based in Berkeley, California.

==Ecology==
The ecology of the National Forest is typical for the western side of the southern Sierra Nevada: distributions of species are largely governed by climate, which is strongly dependent on altitude. The ecology can be described by biotic zones, which are marked by either a tree indicator species, or by a lack of trees. The biotic zones include the foothill woodland zone from (interior live oak), the lower montane zone from (Ponderosa pine), the upper montane zone from (lodgepole pine/red fir), the subalpine zone from (whitebark pine), and the alpine zone from (above the tree line).

Some of the forest are old growth, containing lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;) and red fir (&quot;Abies magnifica&quot;).

==National monument proposal==
A campaign to designate the national forest as a national monument was begun in 2015. The proposal for the Range of Light National Monument would prevent new mining operations and phase out logging and grazing, resulting in a continuous protected area linking Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks. Former Sequoia National Park ranger Deanna Lynn Wulff founded the organization Unite the Parks to campaign for the monument&#x27;s establishment. The proposal has been endorsed by numerous local businesses and organizations, a group of 200 scientists, the California Democratic Party, Democratic National Committee, Sierra Club, and the Coalition to Protect America&#x27;s National Parks. The protection of old-growth trees would contribute to the 30 by 30 initiative. It is opposed by Congressman Tom McClintock and the logging industry.

In December 2022, Congressmembers Jackie Speier and Jerry McNerney introduced a bill that would establish Range of Light National Monument comprising the entirety of Sierra National Forest and the San Joaquin Gorge managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The new national monument would be administered by the National Park Service, which would manage land for conservation rather than multiple-use.

Unite the Parks has also led a lawsuit to prevent logging in fisher habitat.

<text>Frederick William Lawrence (1892-1974) was a Canadian American airbrush painter, and probably the father of realistic spray painting.

Formerly an officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), he served with the Canadian Army in World War I, where he was severely wounded. After months of hospitalization, he was shipped home to Canada. Once he fully recovered, he moved to Michigan, where he worked for Pontiac Motor Company, where he learned to finish cars and to operate a Duco spray gun.

Around 1930, he moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where he worked as an auto body refinisher, and began to experiment with painting pictures using the spray gun during breaks.

As he honed his skills, he was featured in various science magazines, &quot;Time&quot; and on &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It Or Not&quot;. Lawrence began giving performances at automobile shows, spray painting realistic portraits and landscapes in less than an hour. As more airbrush artists began copying his techniques, however, the novelty of his work began to fade, and by World War II, Lawrence was one of thousands of commercial airbrush artists, and died in relative obscurity.

<text>A fastener (US English) or fastening (UK English) is a hardware device that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. In general, fasteners are used to create non-permanent joints; that is, joints that can be removed or dismantled without damaging the joining components. Steel fasteners are usually made of stainless steel, carbon steel, or alloy steel.

Other methods of joining materials, some of which may create permanent joints, include: crimping, welding, soldering, brazing, taping, gluing, cement, or the use of other adhesives. Force may also be used, such as with magnets, vacuum (like suction cups), or even friction (like sticky pads). Some types of woodworking joints make use of separate internal reinforcements, such as dowels or biscuits, which in a sense can be considered fasteners within the scope of the joint system, although on their own they are not general-purpose fasteners.

Furniture supplied in flat-pack form often uses cam dowels locked by cam locks, also known as &quot;conformat fasteners&quot;. Fasteners can also be used to close a container such as a bag, a box, or an envelope; or they may involve keeping together the sides of an opening of flexible material, attaching a lid to a container, etc. There are also special-purpose closing devices, e.g., a bread clip.

Items like a rope, string, wire, cable, chain, or plastic wrap may be used to mechanically join objects; however, because they have additional common uses, they are not generally categorized as fasteners. Likewise, hinges and springs may join objects together, but they are ordinarily not considered fasteners because their primary purpose is to allow articulation rather than rigid affixment.

==Industry==
In 2005, it was estimated that the United States fastener industry runs 350 manufacturing plants and employs 40,000 workers. The industry is strongly tied to the production of automobiles, aircraft, appliances, agricultural machinery, commercial construction, and infrastructure. More than 200 billion fasteners are used per year in the U.S., 26 billion of these by the automotive industry. The largest distributor of fasteners in North America is the Fastenal Company.

==Materials==
There are three major steel fasteners used in industries: stainless steel, carbon steel, and alloy steel. The major grade used in stainless steel fasteners: 200 series, 300 series, and 400 series. Titanium, aluminium, and various alloys are also common materials of construction for metal fasteners. In many cases, special coatings or plating may be applied to metal fasteners to improve their performance characteristics by, for example, enhancing corrosion resistance. Common coatings/platings include zinc, chrome, and hot-dip galvanizing.

==Applications==
When selecting a fastener for industrial applications, it is important to consider a variety of factors. The threading, the applied load on the fastener, the stiffness of the fastener, and the number of fasteners needed should all be taken into account.

When choosing a fastener for a given application, it is important to know the specifics of that application to help select the proper material for the intended use. Factors that should be considered include:

*Accessibility
*Environment, including temperature, water exposure, and potentially corrosive elements
*Installation process
*Materials to be joined
*Reusability
*Weight restrictions

==Types==

A threaded fastener has internal or external screw threads. The most common types are the screw, nut and bolt, possibly involving washers.

Other more specialized types of threaded fasteners include captive threaded fasteners, stud, threaded inserts, and threaded rods.

Other types of fastener include:

=== Common fastener head styles ===

Common head styles include:

* Flat head fasteners: Ideal for applications where aesthetics are a priority, flat head fasteners sit flush with the surface, offering a clean appearance.
* Round head fasteners: With a rounded top, round head fasteners provide a larger bearing surface, suitable for sheet metal or thin plastic assemblies.
* Pan head fasteners: Pan head fasteners combine a slightly flattened top with a larger bearing surface, offering a streamlined appearance for aesthetic applications.
* Socket head fasteners: Designed for high torque applications, socket head fasteners are driven with a hex key, reducing the risk of cam-out.
* Hex head fasteners: Known for their high torque capacity, hex head fasteners are easily driven with a spanner or wrench, ideal for heavy-duty applications.
* Square head fasteners: Offering increased wrenching area and reduced risk of rounding off, square head fasteners are used in high torque applications.
* Flange head fasteners: Integrating a flange for a larger bearing surface, flange head fasteners distribute clamping force without damaging the material.
* Wing head fasteners: Featuring protruding &quot;wings&quot; for hand tightening, wing head fasteners are suitable for applications requiring frequent adjustments.
* T-slot fasteners: Designed for T-slotted aluminium extrusions, T-slot fasteners provide a secure and adjustable connection for framing and guarding systems.

==Standards &amp; traceability ==
There are multiple standards bodies for fasteners, including the US Industrial Fasteners Institute and the European Industrial Fastener Institute.

===ASME B18 standards on certain fasteners===
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) publishes several standards on fasteners. Some are:

* B18.3 Socket Cap, Shoulder, Set Screws, and Hex Keys (Inch Series) 
* B18.6.1 Wood Screws (Inch Series)
* B18.6.2 Slotted Head Cap Screws, Square Head Set Screws, And Slotted Headless Set Screws (Inch Series)
* B18.6.3 Machine Screws, Tapping Screws, and Metallic Drive Screws (Inch Series)
* B18.18 Quality Assurance For Fasteners
* B18.24 Part Identifying Number (PIN) Code System Standard for B18 Fastener Products

=== For military hardware ===
American screws, bolts, and nuts were historically not fully interchangeable with their British counterparts, and therefore would not fit British equipment properly. This, in part, helped lead to the development of numerous United States Military Standards and specifications for the manufacturing of essentially any piece of equipment that is used for military or defense purposes, including fasteners. World War II was a significant factor in this change.

A key component of most military standards is traceability. Put simply, hardware manufacturers must be able to trace their materials to their source, and provide traceability for their parts going into the supply chain, usually via bar codes or similar methods. This traceability is intended to help ensure that the right parts are used and that quality standards are met in each step of the manufacturing process; additionally, substandard parts can traced back to their source.

=== History ===
In 1988, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations investigated counterfeit, mismarked, substandard fasteners and found extensive use in critical civilian and military infrastructure. As a result, they proposed &quot;Fastener Quality Assurance Act of 1988&quot; (HR5051) that would require laboratory testing of fasteners in critical use applications prior to sale.

<doc id="877129" wikidata="Q7240934" url="?curid=877129" title="Present Laughter">
<text>Present Laughter is a comic play written by Noël Coward in 1939 but not produced until 1942 because the Second World War began while it was in rehearsal, and the British theatres closed. The title is drawn from a song in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; that urges &quot;carpe diem&quot; (&quot;present mirth hath present laughter&quot;). The play has been frequently revived in Britain, the US and beyond.

The plot depicts a few days in the life of the successful and self-obsessed light comedy actor Garry Essendine as he prepares to travel for a touring commitment in Africa. Amid a series of events bordering on farce, Garry has to deal with women who want to seduce him, placate both his long-suffering secretary and his wife, cope with a crazed young playwright, and overcome his impending mid-life crisis (he has recently turned forty). The character is a caricature of the author&#x27;s real-life persona, as Coward acknowledged.

Coward starred as Garry during the original run, which began with a long provincial tour to accommodate wartime audiences. He reprised the role in the first British revival and later in the United States and Paris. Subsequent productions have featured Albert Finney, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Donald Sinden, Ian McKellen, Simon Callow and Andrew Scott, and in the United States Clifton Webb, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., George C. Scott, Frank Langella and Kevin Kline.

==Background==
In April and May 1939 Noël Coward wrote two contrasting comedies, both with titles drawn from Shakespeare. One, &quot;This Happy Breed&quot;, was set in a modest suburban household; the other, originally titled &quot;Sweet Sorrow&quot;, later &quot;Present Laughter&quot;, depicted the affairs of a star actor. The title &quot;Present Laughter&quot; is drawn from the song &quot;O Mistress Mine&quot; in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Act 2, Scene 3, which urges &quot;carpe diem&quot; (&quot;present mirth hath present laughter&quot;). The plot of &quot;Present Laughter&quot; had been forming in Coward&#x27;s mind over the previous three years, but he recalled in his memoirs that once he began writing it, the play was completed in six days. He described it as &quot;a very light comedy ... written with the sensible object of providing me with a bravura part&quot;. He planned to appear in both the new plays in the autumn of 1939, and they were in rehearsal for a pre-London tour when the Second World War began on 2 September; all theatres were closed by government order, and the production was shelved.

Between the outbreak of war and 1942 Coward worked for the British government, first in its Paris propaganda office and then for the secret service. In 1942 the prime minister, Winston Churchill, told Coward that he would do more good for the war effort by entertaining the troops and the home front: &quot;Go and sing to them when the guns are firing – that&#x27;s your job!&quot; Though disappointed, Coward followed this advice. He toured, acted and sang indefatigably in Europe, Africa and Asia.

==Original production==
&quot;Present Laughter&quot; was first staged at the beginning of a 25-week tour of Britain by Coward and his cast. His producer, Binkie Beaumont, was opposed to so long a provincial tour, and wanted to open at the Haymarket Theatre in London. Coward countered that in wartime conditions, &quot;the provinces can&#x27;t come to the West End any more, therefore the West End must go to the provinces&quot;. &quot;Present Laughter&quot; was first produced in Blackpool on 20 September 1942, Coward directed and the sets and costumes were designed by Gladys Calthrop. The repertory of the tour also consisted of &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;; the three were advertised collectively as &quot;Noel Coward in his &quot;Play Parade&quot;&quot;. After playing in twenty-two towns and cities in England, Scotland and Wales, the tour ended with a six-week run at the Haymarket.

===Original cast===
*Daphne Stillington – Jennifer Gray
*Miss Erikson – Molly Johnson
*Fred – Billy Thatcher
*Monica Reed – Beryl Measor
*Garry Essendine – Noël Coward
*Liz Essendine – Joyce Carey
*Roland Maule – James Donald
*Henry Lyppiatt – Gerald Case
*Morris Dixon – Dennis Price
*Joanna Lyppiatt – Judy Campbell
*Lady Saltburn – Gwen Floyd

==Plot==
All three acts of the play are set in Garry Essendine&#x27;s London flat. He is a successful West End actor, who has just turned forty.

===Act I===
Daphne Stillington, a young admirer of the actor Garry Essendine, has inveigled herself into the flat and has spent the night there. Garry is still asleep, and while waiting for him to wake, Daphne encounters in turn three of his employees: the housekeeper (Miss Erikson), valet (Fred), and secretary (Monica). None of them display any surprise at her presence. Garry finally wakes and with practised smoothness ushers Daphne out.

Liz Essendine, who left Garry years ago, nevertheless remains part of his tightly-knit &#x27;family&#x27; along with Monica and his manager, Morris Dixon, and producer, Henry Lyppiatt. Liz tells Garry that she suspects that Morris is having an affair with Henry&#x27;s glamorous wife Joanna, and is concerned that this might break up the family. Their discussion is interrupted by the arrival of Roland Maule, an aspiring young playwright from Uckfield, whose play Garry has rashly agreed to critique. Liz leaves, and Roland rapidly becomes obsessively fascinated by Garry, who gets him off the premises as quickly as he can.

Morris and Henry arrive and discuss theatrical business with Garry. Henry leaves for a business trip abroad, and Garry privately interrogates Morris, who denies that he is having an affair with Joanna. Garry telephones Liz to reassure her.

===Act II===
;Scene 1, midnight, three days later.
Garry, alone in the flat, answers the doorbell to find Joanna. She claims (like Daphne in Act I) to have forgotten her own door key and asks Garry to accommodate her in his spare room. He correctly suspects her motives, but after much skirmishing allows himself to be seduced.

;Scene 2, the next morning.
Joanna emerges from the spare room wearing Garry&#x27;s pyjamas just as Daphne did in Act I. She too encounters Miss Erikson, Fred, and then Monica, who is horrified at her presence in such compromising circumstances. Liz arrives and puts pressure on Joanna by threatening to tell Morris that Joanna has spent the night with Garry. Joanna retreats to the spare room when the doorbell rings, but the caller is not Morris but Roland Maule, who says he has an appointment with Garry. Monica leads him to an adjacent room to wait for Garry.

Frantic comings and goings follow, with the flustered arrivals and departures of Morris and Henry, Roland&#x27;s pursuit of Garry, and the arrival of a Lady Saltburn, to whose niece Garry has promised an audition. The niece turns out to be Daphne Stillington, who recites the same Percy Bysshe Shelley poem, &quot;We Meet Not as We Parted&quot;, with which he bade her farewell in Act I. Joanna flounces out from the spare room, Daphne faints with horror, Roland is entranced, and Garry is apoplectic.

===Act III===
A week later, on the eve of Garry&#x27;s departure on tour in Africa, he is once more alone in the flat. The doorbell rings and Daphne enters saying she has a ticket to sail with him to Africa. The doorbell rings again, and Daphne retreats to an adjoining room. The new caller is Roland, who announces that he too has a ticket for the voyage to Africa. Garry tries to get him to leave, but as the doorbell rings a third time Roland bolts into the spare room and locks the door. The third caller is Joanna, who has also bought a ticket for the Africa voyage and has written a letter to Henry and Morris telling them everything. Liz arrives and saves the tottering situation, announcing that she too is travelling to Africa.

Henry and Morris arrive and berate Garry for his night with Joanna. Garry fights back by revealing the details of Morris and Joanna&#x27;s affair, and Henry&#x27;s extramarital adventures. Joanna angrily slaps Garry&#x27;s face and leaves for good. Her departure goes unnoticed because Garry, Henry and Morris have become embroiled in what for them is a much more serious row when it emerges that Henry and Morris have committed Garry to appear at what he considers a shockingly unsuitable theatre. Garry objects: &quot;I will not play a light French comedy to an auditorium that looks like a Gothic edition of Wembley Stadium.&quot; When that row has blown itself out, it is business as usual and Henry and Morris leave in good humour.

Liz pours Garry a brandy and tells him she is not only going to Africa with him but is coming back to him for good. Garry suddenly remembers Daphne and Roland lurking in the adjoining rooms and tells Liz: &quot;You&#x27;re not coming back to me... I&#x27;m coming back to you&quot;, and they tiptoe out.

==Revivals==
The play has been regularly revived. Coward directed and starred in the first West End revival, in 1947. It ran for 528 performances; Carey once again played Liz, Moira Lister played Joanna, and Robert Eddison played Roland. Coward handed on the lead role to Hugh Sinclair in July 1947. The first West End revival after that was in 1965, with Nigel Patrick as Garry.

Notable successors in the role of Garry include Albert Finney (1977), Peter O&#x27;Toole (1978), who also played the role in a production at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., in the same year, Donald Sinden (1981), Tom Conti (1993), Peter Bowles (1996), Ian McKellen (1998), Rik Mayall (2003), and Simon Callow (2006). The National Theatre revived the play in 2007 and 2008 with Alex Jennings as Garry. More recent Garrys have included Samuel West (Theatre Royal, Bath, 2016), Rufus Hound (Chichester Festival Theatre, 2018), and Andrew Scott (Old Vic, 2019).

&quot;Present Laughter&quot; was first staged in the US in 1946; after an out-of-town tour it opened on 29 October 1946 at the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway. It featured Clifton Webb as Garry and closed in March 1947 after 158 performances. In 1958 Coward appeared in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles as Garry with Eva Gabor as Joanna. American successors in the role of Garry Essendine have included Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. (1975), George C. Scott (1982), Frank Langella (1996), Victor Garber (2010), and Kevin Kline (2017).

==Adaptations==
===Stage===
Coward directed and starred in a French translation, &quot;Joyeux Chagrins&quot;, with the central character renamed Max Aramont. The production toured, beginning in Brussels, before opening at the Théâtre Édouard VII in Paris in 1948. In September 1996 a new French adaptation, titled &quot;Bagatelle&quot; was presented at the Théâtre de Paris, starring Michel Sardou in the lead role, now named Jean Delecour.

===Radio===
In September 1956 the BBC broadcast a radio production with John Gielgud as Garry, Nora Swinburne as Liz and Mary Wimbush as Joanna. In 1974, Paul Scofield played the lead role for the BBC, with Fenella Fielding as Joanna, Patricia Routledge as Monica, Miriam Margolyes as Daphne, and Joy Parker (Scofield&#x27;s real wife) as Liz. In April 2013, a radio adaptation was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, starring Samuel West as Garry.

===Television===
As part of the &quot;Play of the Week&quot; series in August 1964 four Coward plays directed and produced by Joan Kemp-Welch were transmitted on ITV, including &quot;Present Laughter&quot;, with Peter Wyngarde as Garry Essendine, Ursula Howells as Liz, Barbara Murray as Joanna and James Bolam as Roland Maule. In 1967 ITV broadcast a production starring Peter O&#x27;Toole as Garry, with Honor Blackman as Liz. The 1981 West End production starring Donald Sinden was filmed for BBC Television.

==Autobiographical references==
Coward acknowledged that the central character, the egocentric actor Garry Essendine, was a self-caricature. Ben Brantley called the play &quot;among the most shameless, if liveliest, self-addressed valentines in theater history.&quot; Coward repeats one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the main characters tiptoe out as the curtain falls – a device that he also used in &quot;Private Lives&quot;, &quot;Hay Fever&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;.

In the 1970s the director Peter Hall wrote, &quot;what a wonderful play it would be if – as Coward must have wanted – all those love affairs were about homosexuals&quot;. Whether or not Coward would have agreed, in the 1940s the transformation of real-life gay relationships into onstage straight ones was essential. The play nevertheless contains many references to Coward&#x27;s own life. Monica is &quot;unmistakably Lorn Loraine&quot;, Coward&#x27;s long-serving and much-loved secretary. Morris has been seen as Coward&#x27;s agent and sometime lover Jack Wilson, and Henry as Binkie Beaumont. Liz, played originally by Joyce Carey, is thought to be based partly on the actress herself, who was a member of Coward&#x27;s inner circle.

==Critical reception and analysis==
The notices for the first production were excellent. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented, &quot;Mr Coward&#x27;s production is so inventive, and his own performance so adroit in its mockery of the vain, posturing, and yet self-scrutinising and self-amused matinee idol, that &quot;Present Laughter&quot; is likely to be future mirth for as long as Mr Coward cares to run it.&quot; &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; added, &quot;One is tempted to cast discretion to the winds and predict that this will be remembered as the best comedy of its kind and generation ... one of those rare occasions when the critic must claim the privilege of his fellow-playgoers, simply to marvel, admire, and enjoy wholeheartedly.&quot; When Coward brought the play back to the Haymarket in 1947, &quot;The Times&quot; praised it as &quot;a wittily impudent and neatly invented burlesque of a French farce.&quot; When it was first seen in the West End without Coward, in 1959, &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;plays as funny as this are no longer being written in England.&quot;

In 1993 Ned Sherrin wrote, &quot;&quot;Present Laughter&quot; is one of Coward&#x27;s four great comedies of manners, along with &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, &quot;Private Lives&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;. It presents a masterly, exaggerated picture not only of the playwright but of his whole household, his court, his admirers, his lifestyle and his era.&quot; Brantley observed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1995, &quot;Yes, Coward was a terrible snob, and there is a certain smugness about &quot;Present Laughter&quot; that it&#x27;s best not to examine too closely&quot;, but, &quot;The sneaking wisdom of &quot;Present Laughter&quot; lies in its suggestion that actorly exaggeration and inner honesty are not mutually exclusive.&quot; In 1998 John Peter said that despite its period setting the play was timeless, and commented, &quot;As in all the greatest comedies in the language, those of Shakespeare, Congreve and Wilde, the wit is both in the situations and the language.&quot; Reviewing the 2016 revival starring Samuel West, Lyn Gardner, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, found the play &quot;deeply unpleasant ... misogynistic and snobbish&quot;. Two years later the same paper&#x27;s chief drama critic, Michael Billington, called it an &quot;imperishable comedy&quot;.

Reviewing the 2019 Old Vic production, a critic in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted that &quot;beneath the frantic surface is a subtle depiction of a man trapped by fame and his own image. ... Garry ... eagerly milks melodrama, hammily proclaiming his misfortunes, namely of being in perpetual service to his entourage. And having &quot;acted&quot; for so long offstage, he&#x27;s reached the point where no one is willing to believe him when trying to be himself.&quot; Another, in &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, remarked that Garry&#x27;s &quot;susceptibility to flattery stems from a deep well of loneliness ... neediness ... drives Garry&#x27;s hunger for affection&quot;. The reviewer of &quot;The Independent&quot; agreed, noting that the leading character&#x27;s surname, Essendine, is an anagram of &quot;neediness&quot;, and commented, &quot;Coward&#x27;s comedy asks us to wonder: who needs whom most – the sun or the planets that orbit it?&quot;

Its first office was started from the Nizam Guest House, which is part of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute on Law College Road. The university was operated at Nizam Guest House until 1 June 1949. Its current building was originally called the Governor House.

<text>McKendree Long (1888–1976) was an American minister and painter.

== Life ==
Educated at Horner Military Academy in Oxford and at Davidson College, he went on to attend classes at the Art Students League in New York. Upon winning a scholarship for study in Europe, he travelled there, learning an academic style of portrait painting. He returned to the United States, working as a professional portraitist in New York City and North Carolina. Long went on to serve in World War I, and abandoned his artistic career afterwards, being ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1922, becoming an evangelist in the southern U.S. In his seventies, Reverend Long began painting again, in a far more surrealistic fashion that widely differed from the style of his previous portraiture.

Grandson Ben Long (born 1945) is also an alumnus of the Art Students League in New York. Ben Long has gained substantial international notoriety, particularly for his drawings and fresco work.

== Archival collections ==

The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has McKendree Robbins Long&#x27;s Papers, including written and printed materials; original drawings, sketches, and illustrations; a folder of photographs; and seven sermons recorded on Duodisc electric transcription discs. Long embellished a portion of his handwritten work with imaginative illustrations and/or illumination, making this collection, and Long, particularly unique.

<text>Y Lliwedd is a mountain, connected to Snowdon in the Snowdonia National Park, North Wales.

Its summit lies above sea level.

The eastern flanks are steep cliffs rising above Glaslyn and Llyn Llydaw. Y Lliwedd is the most conspicuous of the peaks for those who approach Snowdon via the Miners&#x27; and Pyg tracks. Few that summit Snowdon continue over to Y Lliwedd as the challenge of Wales&#x27; highest peak is enough, leaving Y Lliwedd quiet and peaceful even when queues are forming at the summit of Snowdon.

Hikers and mountaineers often pass over Y Lliwedd when walking the Snowdon Horseshoe. The noted British climber George Mallory undertook many of his early climbs here. It was also the site of considerable training activity for the 1953 British Everest Expedition.

The north face of Y Lliwedd was explored in the late 19th century and in 1909 was the subject of the first British climbing guide, &quot;The Climbs on Lliwedd&quot; by J. M. A. Thomson and A. W. Andrews.

Two subsidiary peaks of Y Lliwedd are listed as Nuttalls: Lliwedd Bach : and Y Lliwedd East Peak : .

<text>Crib Goch is described as a &quot;knife-edged&quot; arête in the Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, Wales. The name means &quot;red ridge&quot; in Welsh.

The highest point on the arête is above sea level. All routes which tackle Crib Goch are considered mountaineering routes in winter or scrambles in summer—meaning that they must cross &quot;graded territory&quot; as defined in Steve Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Scrambles in Snowdonia&quot;. The easiest of these lines (the ‘bad step’ part of the route) is given a scrambling grade of Grade 1 (the most difficult being Grade 3—routes more difficult than Grade 3 are considered rock climbs).

==Route==
The classic traverse of Crib Goch from East to West leads up from the Pyg track to a ‘bad step’, where hands and feet are both needed briefly. It is followed by ascent to the arête, before tackling three rock-pinnacles to a grassy col at Bwlch Coch. This first part of the ridge is exposed with precipices below, having resulted in several fatalities, even of experienced mountaineers; the Snowdonia National Park Authority describes it as ‘not a mountain for the inexperienced’. It is also possible to ascend Crib Goch&#x27;s North Ridge, which adjoins the main ridge. The route is far more difficult in high winds or frozen ground, and so it is recommended that walkers check the weather forecast beforehand.

It is possible to ascend Crib Goch from Bwlch y Moch or from Nant Peris, an ascent via Cwm Beudu Mawr.

From the col the ridge rises again, joining the main Snowdon ridge via the sister peak Garnedd Ugain in the west. Here the path meets the Pyg Track (which descends to Pen-y-Pass) at Bwlch Glas (marked by a large standing stone), before the final climb to Snowdon summit. To the south of the arête lie the lakes of Glaslyn and Llyn Llydaw. To the north is the Llanberis Pass. Crib Goch is classed as a Welsh 3000er and is also often climbed as the first part of the Snowdon Horseshoe, which goes on over Garnedd Ugain, Snowdon and Y Lliwedd, before returning to Pen-y-Pass.

Crib Goch is one of the wettest spots in the United Kingdom, with an average of rainfall a year over the past 30 years.

<text>Garnedd Ugain, also known as Crib-y-Ddysgl, is a pyramidal mountain in Wales that forms part of the Snowdon Massif. It is the second-highest peak in Wales, (Although with a far greater topographical prominence Carnedd Llywelyn is usually considered second highest). and lies just under one kilometre north of the summit of Snowdon itself.

It is part of the &quot;Snowdon Horseshoe&quot; route, being linked to Crib Goch via the col at Bwlch Coch, and to Snowdon summit via the col at Bwlch Glas. It is also linked to Cwm Glas to the northeast via a steep arete called Clogwyn y Person, which joins the main Crib y Ddysgl ridge about east of the summit.

==Name==

Both &quot;Garnedd Ugain&quot; and &quot;Crib-y-Ddysgl&quot; appear on the Ordnance Survey&#x27;s maps of the area. The name Crib-y-Ddysgl refers to the east ridge  whilst the summit is &quot;Garnedd&quot; or &quot;Carnedd Ugain&quot;.

Crib-y-Ddysgl (meaning &quot;ridge of the dish&quot; in Welsh) is the name used by Alan Dawson for the peak&#x27;s listing as a Hewitt.

&quot;Carnedd Ugain&quot; in Welsh means &quot;Cairn of the Twenty&quot; (the form &quot;Garnedd&quot; is the result of soft mutation). This was possibly named after the Roman legion based in Caernarfon.

The web pages of the Welsh Mountaineering Club suggest that the name could also be a corruption of &quot;Carnedd Wgon&quot;, and so named after the prince Wgon sung of by Dafydd ap Gwilym or possibly after the 13th-century poet Gwgon Brydydd.

<doc id="877142" wikidata="Q4867617" url="?curid=877142" title="Baskerville Shield">
<text>The Baskerville Shield is a trophy awarded to the winner of rugby league test series between England and New Zealand. It named in honour of Albert Henry Baskerville, who organised the first ever tour by New Zealand of Great Britain in 1907.

The spelling of the trophy is somewhat controversial, as there is much evidence to suggest that &quot;Baskiville&quot; was the correct spelling of the surname. However, the Rugby Football League used the &quot;Baskerville&quot; spelling arguing that this was the version used by the man himself.

There is also a trophy with this name awarded to the winner of the National Competition in New Zealand.

==History==
The shield was inaugurated for the 2002 New Zealand tour of Great Britain and France in which New Zealand played eight games in Europe and one in Oceania, winning six of these, including three against British club sides and one against an England A team. The test series between New Zealand and Great Britain was drawn, with one win each and one draw. The New Zealand Rugby League agreed that Great Britain should keep the inaugural shield because it wasn&#x27;t won outright. 

In the 2007 New Zealand tour of Great Britain and France, Great Britain won the series 3-0 to retain the shield. The largest of these losses was a 0-44 result in front of 20,324 at the KC Stadium, Hull. The tour was conducted as part of the celebrations of 100 years of New Zealand rugby league and was played in honour of the original 1907 tour. New Zealand played six games in total with five of these in Europe. After the tour, the Great Britain team was put on hiatus with the individual home nations taking priority on the international stage and as a result lengthy tours stopped taking place.

In the 2015 New Zealand tour of England, the shield was contested between New Zealand and England as the Great Britain team had been retired in 2007. England won the shield 2–1. The tour was the first to Europe by an Australasian team since the previous tour by New Zealand in 2007. The tour took place because Australia pulled out of a similar tour that they had agreed to undertake. The tour was shorter than others with just four games taking place, three against England and one against Leeds Rhinos. New Zealand won the Leeds game and the second test by just 9–2 in front of 44,393 at Olympic Stadium, London.

England and New Zealand contested the Baskerville Shield again during the 2018 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain. England won the shield 2–1, taking an unassailable lead with victories in the first two tests before New Zealand gained a consolation win in the final match.

Great Britain toured New Zealand and Papua New Guinea in 2019, which was the first Baskerville Shield to be played out in the southern hemisphere.

==Attendances==

===Average attendances===
The 2015 series saw an average of 11,527 more people attend the three tests, this major increase owing largely to the test played at Olympic Stadium, London when 44,393 people were in attendance.

Seven different stadiums have been used over the twelve tests that have taken place. DW Stadium, Wigan has been used the most times with three tests held there.

===Highest Attendances===
The highest attendance in the history of the Baskerville Shield test series is 44,393 which was seen at the Olympic Stadium, London, the only game to be played outside of the traditional rugby league heartland of the north of England.

<text>Moussa Arafat al-Qudwa (; died 7 September 2005) was one of the founders of Fatah and a leading official in the Fatah Revolutionary Council. He was a cousin of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

==Career==
Moussa Arafat was chief of military intelligence in the 1990s. In 2004, he was head of the general security branch in the Gaza Strip. In July 2004, Arafat was nominated head of the Palestinian Security Services in West Bank and Gaza Strip. This nomination and corruption claims against Arafat&#x27;s family were partially the catalyst for intense armed conflict in the streets of Gaza between Palestinian &#x27;militants&#x27; of the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigade group and fighters loyal to Chairman Arafat&#x27;s Fatah.

Following the conflict, Yasser Arafat reshuffled the Gaza security apparatus and appointed Abdel-Razek al-Majaideh to the new post of overall director of security for the West Bank and Gaza, outranking Moussa Arafat.

In April 2005, Arafat was removed from his position as security chief but was subsequently named as adviser on military affairs with ministerial rank.

A power struggle between rival Palestinian factions emerged in Gaza and the West Bank in anticipation of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s plan to withdraw troops and settlers from the occupied territory by the end of 2005.

In 2003, Arafat escaped injury in an explosion in his office caused by rockets fired, he claimed, by Palestinian enemies. In October 2004, Moussa Arafat and a top security official in the Gaza Strip, survived a car bomb that exploded in his convoy. Israel&#x27;s military denied involvement.

==Death in militant raid==
Shortly before 5 AM on 7 September 2005, dozens of masked gunmen (estimates of their number range from 80 to 100) in a convoy of about 20 vehicles, and armed with assault rifles and anti-tank grenades, stormed Arafat&#x27;s home in Gaza. After a gunfight with Arafat, the gunmen dragged Arafat outside, and shot him dead.

While Arafat&#x27;s home was near a security forces headquarters and only 300–400 metres from Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas&#x27;s residence, media reports reported that the police had not came to the scene until 7 AM, two hours after the incident.

==Aftermath of Moussa Arafat&#x27;s assassination==
Mohammed Abdel Al, a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a militant group, claimed responsibility for Arafat&#x27;s assassination, saying it killed Arafat to punish him for corruption after the Palestinian security forces had taken no action against him. The PRC consists mainly of former members of the Fatah movement, who have accused Palestinian leaders of graft.

Mahmoud Abbas pledged to track down Arafat&#x27;s killers but nothing was done. The main suspects are Palestinian offshoot groups.

Arafat&#x27;s oldest son, Manhal, and three bodyguards were kidnapped by the gunmen who killed Arafat. The bodyguards were released shortly thereafter, but Manhal was held for a day before being released to an Egyptian government delegation in Gaza.

<doc id="877152" wikidata="Q2246627" url="?curid=877152" title="Eriskay Pony">
<text>The Eriskay Pony ( or &quot;Each Èirisgeach&quot;) is a breed of pony from Scotland. It is generally grey in colour, and has a dense, waterproof coat that protects it in harsh weather. The breed developed in ancient times in the Hebrides of Scotland, and a small population remained pure and protected from crossbreeding by the remoteness of the islands. It is used for light draught work, as a mount for children, in many equestrian disciplines, and for driving. 

The Rare Breeds Survival Trust considering the breed&#x27;s status to be critical. There are two breed registries for the Eriskay Pony: &quot;Comann Each nan Eilean - The Eriskay Pony Society&quot;, which was formed in 1972 and has the King Charles III as society patron, and &quot;The Eriskay Pony Society&quot; was formed in 1986. Both societies are recognised as holding a studbook of origin for the breed. and resembles the exmoor pony and are usually gray but sometimes are black or bay.

==Characteristics==

The Eriskay Pony generally stands between . It is usually grey in colour, although a few are bay or black. Dark coloured animals generally have the pangaré characteristics of a light-coloured muzzle and ring around their eye. However, according to breed standards set by the late Robert Beck MRCVS BVMS, a longstanding member of &quot;Comann Each nan Eilean - The Eriskay Pony Society&quot;, they should not have an eel stripe. Chestnut, piebald, skewbald and excess white markings are discouraged by breed registries. 

The winter coat is dense and waterproof to protect from the harsh climate, with a thick mane and tail. The head is large, with a wide forehead. The neck and shoulders are well muscled, and the chest deep but generally not broad. The rib-cage is long and the loins short, which increases the strength of the back. The croup is slightly sloping. 

The Eriskay has an easy-going temperament, and is suitable as a mount for children. It is used for light draught work, as well as dressage, show jumping, three-day eventing, western riding and driving. Eriskays have successfully competed in combined driving at highly competitive international level competitions sanctioned by the Fédération Équestre Internationale. They have also been used in therapeutic horse-riding.

==History==

The Eriskay Pony developed in the Hebrides of Scotland, a group of western isles in Scotland and were originally known as the Western Isles Ponies. The origins of the breed are ancient, with roots in Celtic and Norse breeding. It is physically similar to drawings of ponies on ancient Pictish stones found in north and west Scotland. It is related to other northern breeds, including the Icelandic horse and the Faroe pony. The Eriskay takes its name from the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Originally, the breed had a fairly large population, and until the mid-19th century the Eriskay and similar ponies were found throughout the western islands of Scotland. They were used as crofters&#x27; ponies, as pack animals, for light draught and as mounts for children.

During the 19th century numbers were much reduced through increased crossbreeding. The crossbreeding was used to produce larger ponies for draught work, and Eriskays and other island ponies were crossed with horse breeds from mainland Europe, including Arabs and Clydesdales. Other horses, including the Norwegian Fjord, were crossed with island ponies, including the Eriskay, to produce the Highland pony. A few specimens of the Eriskay were preserved on the remotest island of Eriskay in Scotland, mainly due to the difficulties of accessing the island. This stock of ponies remained pure, but through the advent of mechanisation, declined in population to around 20 animals in the early 1970s. In 1941 the SS Politician foundered off the Eriskay coast, and the islanders, using the Eriskay ponies, carried away the cargo of 250,000 bottles of whisky.
Today the Eriskay is rare. Its population is considered to be at critical status by the UK-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust, meaning that there are 300 or fewer breeding females registered in the world today. It is possible that the Eriskay is the last surviving Hebridean pony breed. There are two breed Societies each of which are Mother Societies in their own right: &quot;The Eriskay Pony Society&quot; achieved legal recognition as a breed society and passport issuing organisation for the UK in 1995 and &quot;Comann Each nan Eilean - The Eriskay Pony Society&quot;, which is based in the Isle of Eriskay, received legal recognition in 2002. Both Societies maintain studbooks which are recognised as studbooks of origin for the Eriskay Pony and &quot;Comann Each nan Eilean - The Eriskay Pony Society&quot; keeps the original studbooks of the &quot;Society for the Preservation of the Eriskay Pony&quot; from 1972. Both studbooks have their origins in the original studbook. The aim of both Societies is to preserve the breed by retaining the original genetic material and following a careful breeding programme which slows, as far as possible, the rate of inbreeding. Only stock registered in either of the studbooks is used. In conjunction with the Rare Breeds Survival Trust &quot;The Eriskay Pony Society&quot; uses the Single Population Analysis Records Keeping System (SPARKS) to provide advice on the genetic suitability of breeding pairs of ponies. 

In addition to the domesticated ponies, there is a small herd of Eriskay ponies living in a feral state on the Holy Isle. These ponies are descended from a group of five ponies brought to the Holy Isle to when it was owned by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in the 1970s to form a nature reserve. Today the island is owned by the Samye Buddhist Centre for World Peace and Health. They operate a policy of non-intervention, allowing the ponies to live without human interference.

== Culture ==
The Gaelic poet Donald MacDonald (&quot;Dòmhnall Aonghais Bhàin&quot;) was commissioned by &quot;Comann Each nan Eilean - The Eriskay Pony Society&quot; to compose a praise poem for the Eriskay pony to commemorate the publication of the original studbook in 1972. The poem makes reference to the pony&#x27;s position as a crofting animal used to transport seaweed and peat, as well as its genial nature towards children.&quot;Bha iad riamh an Èirisgeidh &#x27;s gum b&#x27; fheumail iad don t-sluagh,&quot;

&quot;Bha iad troimh na linntean ann sna tìmean chaidh air ruaig;&quot;

&quot;Thàirneadh iad a&#x27; mhòine gu fògairt chur air fuachd&quot;

&quot;Is làimhsicheadh an òigridh iad &#x27;s bha iomadh spòrs &#x27;nan cuairt.&quot;

<text>In Judaism, the &#x27; (), also spelled &#x27; or &#x27;, is any of a variety of sacrificial offerings described and commanded in the Torah. The plural form is &#x27;, &#x27;, or &#x27;.

The term primarily refers to sacrificial offerings given from humans to God for the purpose of doing homage, winning favor, or securing pardon. The object sacrificed was usually an animal that was ritually slaughtered and then transferred from the human to the divine realm by being burned on an altar. Other sacrifices include grain offerings made of flour and oil, not meat.

After the destruction of the Second Temple, sacrifices were prohibited because there was no longer a Temple, the only place allowed by halakha for sacrifices. Offering of sacrifices was briefly reinstated during the Jewish–Roman wars of the second century CE.

When sacrifices were offered in ancient times, they were offered as a fulfillment of Biblical commandments. According to Orthodox Judaism, the coming of the messiah will not remove the requirement to keep the 613 commandments, and when the Temple is rebuilt, sacrifices will be offered again.

While some were offered as part of the atonement process for sin, this role was strictly limited, and in Judaism atonement can be achieved through means such as repentance even without sacrifices.

==Etymology==
The Semitic root () means and is found in a number of related languages in addition to Hebrew, e.g. in the Akkadian language noun , meaning . In Hebrew it is found in a number of words, such as , , , , and the verb form , . The noun (plural , ) first occurs in the Bible in and occurs 80 times in the Masoretic Text; 40 times in Leviticus, 38 in Numbers and twice in Ezekiel. The related form appears only in and referring to the &#x27;wood offering&#x27;. The etymology of the &#x27;offer&#x27; sense is traditionally understood as deriving from the verbal sense of &#x27;bringing near&#x27;, viz. bringing the offering near to the deity, but some theological explanations see it rather as bringing &quot;man back to God&quot;.

The Septuagint generally translates the term in Koine Greek as , , , , or , . By the Second Temple period, Hellenistic Jewish texts use korban specifically to mean a vow. The New Testament preserves korban once as a transliterated loan-word for a vow, once also a related noun, (), otherwise using , or and other terms drawn from the Septuagint. Josephus also generally uses other words for &#x27;offering&#x27; but uses for the vow of the Nazirites (Antiquities of the Jews 4:73 / 4,4,4) and cites Theophrastus as having cited a korban vow among the Tyrians (&quot;Against Apion&quot; 1.167 / 1,22,4).

==Purpose==
The idea conveyed in most was that of a &quot;gift&quot; to God.

 served a variety of purposes. Many were brought purely for the purpose of communing with God and becoming closer to God, or in order to express thanks, gratitude, and love to God.

While some were offered as part of the atonement process for sin, this role was strictly limited. Standard sin-offerings could only be offered for unintentional sins; according to the rabbis, they could not be offered for all sins, but only for unintentional violations of some of the most serious sins. In addition, generally had no expiating effect without sincere repentance and restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation. In the absence of sacrifices, atonement can still be achieved through means such as repentance, prayer, or giving .

The slaughter of an animal sacrifice is not considered a fundamental part of the sacrifice, but rather is an unavoidable preparatory step to the offering of its meat to God; thus, the slaughter may be performed by any Jew, while the other stages of the sacrifice could only be performed by priests.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Laws and stories=== 

Offerings are mentioned in the Book of Genesis, but further outlined in the later four books of the Torah, including aspects of their origins and history. Cain and Abel, Noah, Abraham, and Jacob offered sacrifices, as did the Israelites at Mount Sinai.

The Torah contains many laws regarding sacrifices. Every regular weekday, Sabbath, and many Jewish holidays had their own unique offerings. Sacrificial procedures were described in detail. Sacrifices were only to be offered by the (hereditary priesthood), whom the Hebrew Bible describes as descendants of Aaron who meet certain marital and ritual purity requirements.

Sacrifices were offered in varying locations. Before building the Temple in Jerusalem, when the Israelites were in the desert, sacrifices were only to be offered in the Tabernacle. After the invasion of Canaan, sacrifices were also permitted at bamot in any location until the nation&#x27;s enemies had been defeated and the people lived securely, after which sacrifices were supposed to be centralized again. However, in practice the &quot;bamot&quot; were still used even in the secure monarchic period, and the Bible sometimes criticizes Israelite kings for allowing this. Sacrifices outside the main sanctuary are recorded at Beit Shemesh, Mizpah, Ramah, Gilgal, and Bethlehem, among other locations.

After the entry to Canaan, the main sacrificial centre was initially at Shiloh. Under Saul the main center of sacrifice was Nob, though private offerings continued to be made at Shiloh. David created a new sacrificial center in Jerusalem at the threshing floor of Araunaḥ, adjacent to Jerusalem, to which he moved the Ark. According to the Hebrew Bible, after the building of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, sacrifices were only to be carried out there. After Solomon&#x27;s Temple was destroyed, sacrifices were resumed when the Second Temple was built, until the Second Temple was also destroyed in 70 CE.

===Attitudes===
Many of the Biblical prophets criticized those Israelites who brought sacrifices while continuing to violate God&#x27;s will with immoral behavior. This criticism often took the form of scathing denunciations:


However, while rejecting the value of sacrifices accompanied by unjust behavior, the same prophets promised an eventual reconciliation between God and a more moral people of Israel, and proclaimed that the reestablishment of sacrifices would be a sign of this reconciliation. Thus sacrifices have a place in their visions of eventual redemption:


===List of sacrifices===
This is an incomplete list of sacrifices mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

Types of sacrifice include:
* Burnt offering (&quot;olah&quot;), entirely burnt on the altar
* Peace offering (&quot;shelamim&quot;), mostly eaten by humans
* Sin offering (&quot;hatat&quot;)
* Guilt offering (&quot;asham&quot;)
* Gift offering (&quot;mincha&quot;), consisting of vegetable rather than animal products

Sacrifices offered on specific occasions include:

==Rabbinical interpretation==

===100 among the 613 commandments===
According to Maimonides, about one hundred of the permanent 613 commandments based on the Torah, by rabbinical enumeration, directly concern sacrifices, excluding those commandments that concern the actual Temple and the priests themselves of which there are about another fifty.

===Instructions in Mishnah and Talmud===
The Mishnah and Talmud devote a very large section, known as a , to the study and analysis of this subject known as , whereby all the detailed varieties of korbanot are enumerated and analyzed in great logical depth, such as () and (). In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. Pesachim is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the Passover sacrifice. Yoma contains a detailed discussion of the Yom Kippur sacrifices, and there are sections in Seder Moed (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major Jewish holidays. Shekalim discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, and Nashim discusses the offerings made by Nazirites and the suspected adulteress.

The Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the Passover offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.

===Rationale and rabbinic commentary===
Maimonides, a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides&#x27; view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. This view is controversial since the Torah also forbids worship of foreign idols and practices of pagan religions as &quot;detestable&quot; before God including their sacrifices. Maimonides concludes that God&#x27;s decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, he writes:
In contrast, many others such as Nahmanides (in his commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nahmanides cites the fact that the Torah records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the near sacrifice of Isaac was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.

Through a non-all encompassing view of the ritual life of &quot; as it is presented in the book of Genesis, the evolving philosophical theology that seems to underlie the modes of worship that [he] develops over time [...] is reconstruct[ed.]&quot; Abram&#x27;s building of a number of altars without mentioning that he sacrificed animals on them, and that for most of these occasions, he &quot;called out in the name of God&quot; is interpreted by Lebens as theologically stating that God&#x27;s desires are sated without animal sacrifices. Noting that not all these altar building occasions were accompanied by call-outs, and that call-outs also took place on returns, in &quot;Everlasting Dominion&quot;, American Old Testament scholar Eugene H. Merrill attributes a multipurpose nature to the altars, in which Abram was participating in only one:

Nonetheless, Abram also engaged in the covenant of the pieces which was based on this divine set of promises accompanied by obligations and an animal sacrifice ritual to the extent that it physically symbolized irrevocability. Likewise, in Hebrew, the verb meaning to seal a covenant translates literally as &quot;to cut.&quot; Furthermore, to measure the general importance given to animal sacrifice preceding Abram in Genesis, in the story of Cain and Abel the only differentiator mentioned leading God to &quot;[have] not respect [...] unto Cain and to his offering&quot; was Abel&#x27;s &quot;firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof&quot; as opposed to Cain&#x27;s &quot;fruit of the ground[.]&quot; Then, starkly contrasting a diminutive effect resulting from Abram&#x27;s altar building and call-outs, animal sacrifice was institutionalized in the era of Moses in the Book of Numbers 28:1-30:1. The schedule of obligatory sacrifices included two daily lamb burnt-offerings. However, the physical participation of God in the consumption of sacrificial offerings is debatable. The seeming all-time peak occurred with his conclusive victory as Yahweh when Elijah challenged worshippers of the Canaanite deity Baal to pray for fire to light their respective bull animal sacrifices.

===As a metaphor===
Metaphorically, a person&#x27;s efforts to purify their soul are described as &quot;sacrific[ing one&#x27;s] animalistic nature&quot;, in order to allow them to become close to God (in keeping with the root of the word , meaning to draw close). Devotion to God can be described as &quot;sacrificing one&#x27;s soul to God&quot;, as in the poem &quot;Bilvavi mishkan evneh&quot; by Yitzchak Hutner.

==The end of sacrifices==
With the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.

Rabbinic Judaism was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Jewish observance in the direction of text study, prayer, and other practices, which were seen to varying extents as substitutes for the Temple service. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature on this subject:

In the Babylonian Talmud, a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices:

Nonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one&#x27;s Father&#x27;s table, whose loss synagogue worship does not entirely replace. One example is in :

Another example is in :

===In non-Orthodox Judaism===
Non-Orthodox branches of Judaism (Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist) regard the korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return.

Conservative Judaism disavows the resumption of . Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative , including the morning study section from the sacrifices and prayers for the restoration of qorbanot in the , and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on , including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced woman or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a Temple in some form, and in the continuation of and Levites under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to Shabbat and Festival , changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox &quot;and there we will sacrifice&quot; is changed to &quot;and there they sacrificed&quot;). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. Siddur Sim Shalom, a common siddur in Conservative synagogues in North America, provides both service alternatives.

Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism disavow all belief in a restoration of a Temple, the resumption of , or the continuation of identified Cohens or Levites. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to from their prayer books.

==In prayer==

The traditional prayer book, as developed over the past two millenia, contains many references to Temple sacrifices, prayers for their resumption, and rituals intended to remind worshipers of the Temple service.

Numerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices.

===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===
Today Orthodox Judaism includes mention of each on either a daily basis in the (daily prayer book) or in the (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of Conservative Judaism, in an abbreviated fashion.

References to sacrifices in the Orthodox prayer service include:
* The standard prayer services (shacharit, mincha, maariv, and mussaf) were instituted to correspond to sacrifices once offered at the same times.
* The mussaf prayer (recited on Shabbat and Jewish holidays) requests the reinstitution of the special sacrifices for those days.
* (see section below) – a section of the morning prayer service devoted to readings related to the sacrifices.
* – Every Orthodox , the central prayer of Jewish services, contains the paragraph: &quot;Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service of the Holy of Holies of Your House, and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.&quot; (Conservative Judaism removes the fire-offerings clause from this prayer.)
* – Private recitation of the traditionally ends with the prayer for the restoration of the Temple.
* The itself is said to represent liturgically the of the daily , while the recitation of the sections fulfill the to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.
* After the weekday Torah reading, a prayer is recited for the restoration of the Temple: &quot;May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.&quot;
* The Torah reading for each Jewish holiday includes the passage describing that holiday&#x27;s mussaf sacrifice.
* The traditional texts for selichot, and for each Yom Kippur prayer, include a request that God fulfill the promise of that sacrifices will be resumed in the Temple and accepted by God.

===The section of prayer===
A section of the morning daily prayer is called , and is mostly devoted to recitation of legal passages relating to the sacrifices. According to the Talmud, this recitation takes the place of the sacrificial offering, and achieves the same atonement that would have been achieved by sacrifices if they were possible.

In the Nusach Ashkenaz custom, this section includes the following:
* – the biblical command to offer a daily morning and evening sacrifice (, )
:*On Shabbat and Rosh Chodesh, Biblical verses regarding the mussaf offerings for those days ( and respectively) are recited after the &quot;Korban Tamid&quot;.
* – a concise overview of all the sacrifices and many of their laws (Chapter 5 of Mishnah Zevachim). Some suggest that it was included in the at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it.
* – Rabbi Yishmael&#x27;s 13 rules of exegesis (Introduction to the Sifra).
* The study session concludes with a short prayer () &quot;...that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days... and may the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.&quot;

The passage does not discuss sacrifices, and recitation of both it and was instituted so that a person would study a selection of each of the three divisions of Torah (mikra, mishnah, gemara) each day, not because of any connection to sacrifices. However, these passages are still commonly considered part of the section of prayer.

In a later period, some communities began to add the following (all or some of the paragraphs):
* – Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the (offerings), based on 
* – Removing the ashes of the (elevation offering), based on 
* (Incense offering): Based on and as well as a rabbinic text derived from Talmud ( 6a; Jerusalem Talmud 4:5, 33a).

==Resumption of sacrifices==

===Attitudes===

The prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the messianic era, the Messiah will come, and a Third Temple will be built. The standard Amidah prayer-text, recited daily by Jews worldwide for the last 1800 years, asks God to &quot;return the service to the Holy of Holies of your Temple, and the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayers may you accept with favor&quot;. It is believed that the will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. 

According to some classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not be offered: &quot;In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued.&quot;

Maimonides and Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, despite some claims, believed that sacrifices would be resumed in the messianic era. However, Kook believed that sacrifices could only be resumed once there was &quot;an open appearance of the holy spirit in Israel&quot;. Rabbi Hayim David HaLevi suggested that the future sacrificial service might be limited to grain-offerings, with no animal sacrifices being performed. He based this assertion, which he called &quot;highly novel&quot;, on which speaks only of future mincha offerings, as well as the assumption that the word &quot;mincha&quot; refers to grain-offerings, as it usually does. However, according to other interpretations, &quot;mincha&quot; can also refer to animal sacrifices.

According to a minority opinion in the Talmud, in the future the Torah&#x27;s commandments will be nullified. Interpretations of this statement differ as to which commandments will be nullified, for whom, and at what stage (for example, Rashba ruled that commandments are nullified for a person after they have died but never for the living). Some kabbalistic sources envision a messianic era when the natural order will drastically change, and animals will be on a human level, at which point no animal sacrifices will be offered.

Orthodox Judaism holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time.

Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism hold that no animal sacrifices will be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all.

===Halakhic issues===
In the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of responsa concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices. The debate on this topic involves numerous complex halakhic questions, among them:
* Whether Jews are commanded nowadays to build a Temple
* Whether sacrifices may be offered in the absence of a Temple
* Whether the proper locations of the Temple building and altar can be identified
* Whether the surviving halachic texts provide enough detail to construct the Temple and its vessels properly
* Whether the current state of ritual impurity prevents offering sacrifices
* Whether the proper representation of the Jewish people can be organized for communal sacrifices
* Whether priests and Levites whose status can be properly verified can be identified.

During the early 20th century, Israel Meir Kagan advised some followers to set up special yeshivas for married students known as that would specialize in the study of the korbanot and study with greater intensity the sections of the Talmud in order to prepare for the arrival of the Jewish Messiah who would oversee the rebuilding of the original Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem that would be known as the Third Temple. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established Haredi institutions in Israel that focus solely on the subject of the , , and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty.

===Efforts to resume sacrifices===

A few groups, notably the Temple Institute and the Temple Mount Faithful, have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a Third Temple on the Temple Mount and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a Jewish Messiah as part of a future Jewish eschatology, and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The Temple Institute has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.

== References in non-rabbinic sources==

===New Testament===
In the New Testament, Jesus is recorded in Mark 7:11 as criticising the practice of dedicating possessions as Corban.

===Josephus===
The Jewish historian Josephus mentions the word &quot;Corban&quot; in his history &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, written in the first century CE. Josephus records (2.9.4) that the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate expended the money given to the temple treasury as Corban on the construction of am aqueduct. This action caused a riot, which Pilate violently suppressed.

<text>Arran (Middle Persian form; Persian: اران or اردهان), also known as Aran or Ardhan, was a geographical name used in ancient and medieval times to signify a historically-Iranian region which lay within the triangle of land, lowland in the east and mountainous in the west, formed by the junction of the Kura and Aras rivers, including the highland and lowland Karabakh, Mil plain and parts of the Mughan plain. In pre-Islamic times, it corresponded roughly to the territory of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan. The term is the Middle Persian equivalent to the Greco-Roman &quot;Albania&quot;. It was known as &quot;Aghvania&quot;, &quot;Alvan-k&quot; in Armenian, and &quot;Al-ran&quot; (Arabized form of &quot;Arran&quot;) in Arabic.

Today, the term Aran is mainly used in Azerbaijan to indicate territories consisting of Mil and Mughan plains (mostly, Beylagan, Imishli, Kurdamir, Saatly, Sabirabad provinces of the Republic of Azerbaijan). It has also been used by Iranian historian Enayatollah Reza to refer to the country of Azerbaijan, freeing the name &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; to refer to a region within Iran. The bulk of the territory of the republic of Azerbaijan was the historic Shirvan, as well as Quba/Qubbah).

==Name==
The region is known as &quot;Ardhan&quot; in Parthian, &quot;Al-Ran&quot; in Arabic, &quot;Aghvank&quot; or &quot;Alvank&quot; in Armenian, &quot;Rani&quot; () in Georgian and &quot;Caucasian Albania&quot; in Latin.

According to the Movses Kagankatvatsi, &quot;Arran&quot; or &quot;Arhan&quot; was the name of the legendary founder of Caucasian Albania, who in some versions was the son of Noah&#x27;s son Yafet (Japheth) and also, possibly the eponym of the ancient Caucasian Albanians (&quot;Aghvan&quot;), and/or the Iranian tribe known as Alans (Alani). The nearby Araks (Aras) river was known to Ancient Greek geographers as the &quot;Araxes&quot;, and has a source near Mount Ararat. James Darmesteter, in his discussion of the geography of the Avesta&#x27;s &quot;Vendidad&quot; I, observes that the 12th century &quot;Bundahishn&quot; (29:12) identified the &quot;Airyana Vaego by the Vanguhi Daitya&quot; on the northern border of Azerbaijan, and did so &quot;probably in order that it should be as near as possible to the seat of the Zoroastrian religion yet without losing its supernatural character by the counter-evidence of facts.&quot; Darmesteter further associated the Vanguhi Daitya river with the Araxes, and compared the name &quot;Airyana Vaego&quot; with that of Arran.

According to English historian and Orientalist C.E. Bosworth:
Later Greek writers also call the country Ariania instead of Albania, and the people Arianoi instead of Albanoi. In some Classical authors one finds the form Arian/Aryan.

==Boundaries==

In pre-Islamic times, Caucasian Albania/Arran was a wider concept than that of post-Islamic Arran. Ancient Arran covered all of eastern Transcaucasia, which included most of the territory of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic and part of the territory of Dagestan. However, in post-Islamic times the geographic notion of Arran shrank to the territory between the rivers of Kura and Araks.

A medieval chronicle, the &quot;Ajayib-ad-Dunya&quot;, written in the 13th century by an unknown author, says Arran was 30 parasangs (200 km) in width, and 40 &quot;farsakhs&quot; (270 km) in length. The entire right bank of the Kura river until it joined with the Aras was attributed to Arran (the left bank of the Kura was known as Shirvan). The boundaries of Arran have shifted throughout history, sometimes encompassing the entire territory of the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan, and at other times only parts of the South Caucasus. Sometimes Arran was part of Armenia.

Medieval Islamic geographers gave descriptions of Arran in general, and of its towns, including Barda, Beylagan, and Ganja.

==History==
:&quot;History of Arran is summarized in History of Azerbaijan section, where you can refer for detailed description.&quot;

===Pre-Islamic===

===Islamic===

Following the Arab invasion of Iran, the Arabs invaded the Caucasus in the 8th century and most of the former territory of Caucasian Albania was included under the name of Arran. This region was at times part of the Abbasid Caliphate based on numismatic and historical evidence. Dynasties of Parthian or Persian descent, such as the Mihranids had come to rule the territory during Sassanian times. Its kings were given the title &quot;Arranshah&quot;, and after the Arab invasions, fought against the caliphate from the late 7th to middle 8th centuries.

Early Muslim ruling dynasties of the time included Rawadids, Sajids, Salarids, Shaddadids, Shirvanshahs, and the Sheki and Tiflis emirates. The principal cities of Arran in early medieval times were Bardha&#x27;a (Partav) and Ganja. Bardha&#x27;a reached prominence in the 10th century and was used to house a mint. Bardha&#x27;a was sacked by the Rus and Norse several times in the 10th century as a result of the Caspian expeditions of the Rus. Bardha&#x27;a never recovered after these raids and was replaced as capital by Beylaqan, which in turn was sacked by the Mongols in 1221. After this Ganja rose to prominence and became the central city of the region. The capital of the Shaddadid dynasty, Ganja was considered the &quot;mother city of Arran&quot; during their reign.

The territory of Arran became a part of the Seljuq Empire, followed by the Ildegizid state. It was taken briefly by the Khwarizmid dynasty and then overran by Mongol Hulagu empire in the 13th century. Later, it became a part of Chobanid, Jalayirid, Timurid, and Iranian Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar states which means at least from 1500 until 1828, when Iran lost a major battle to the expanding Russian Empire and as a result had to sign the Treaty of Turkmenchay (, ) in which it had to concede all the Caucasus territories to Russia.

==People==

The population of Arran consisted of a great variety of peoples. Greek, Roman and Armenian authors provide the names of some peoples who inhabited the lands between the Kur and Araxes rivers:

* Utians and Mycians — apparently migrants from the south,
* Caspians, Gargarians and Gardmans 
* Sakasenians — of Scythian origin,
* Gelians, Sodians, Lupenians, Balasanians — possibly Caucasian tribes,
* Parsians and Parrasians — were probably Iranian

In the late 4th century, when the region passed to Caucasian Albania, its population consisted of Armenians and Armenicized aborigines, though many of the latter were still cited as distinct ethnic entities.

In pre-Islamic times the population of Arran and most of Caucasian Albania had mostly been Christian who belonged to the Church of Caucasian Albania. Under Arabic rule (7th to 9th centuries) a part of the population was Islamicized and adopted Alevism. Muslim chronicles of the 10th century reported that some of the population of Arran spoke al-rānīya, as well as Arabic and Persian languages. Because there is no written evidence, some scholars have presumed al-rānīya to be an Iranian dialect while others have presumed it to be a remnant of a Caucasian Albanian language. The area in which there was Ganja, during the 9th to 12th century named Arran; its urban population spoke mainly in Persian.

After the Turkification of the region, the population became Turkic speaking, and thus referred to by Europeans, particularly the Russians, as Tartars. They were much later called Azerbaijanis.

With the exception of some Udi, the population of Arran which remained Christian, was ultimately absorbed by the Armenians and in part by the Georgians.

<doc id="877167" wikidata="Q1136527" url="?curid=877167" title="High-intensity discharge lamp">
<text>High-intensity discharge lamps (HID lamps) are a type of electrical gas-discharge lamp which produces light by means of an electric arc between tungsten electrodes housed inside a translucent or transparent fused quartz or fused alumina arc tube. This tube is filled with noble gas and often also contains suitable metal or metal salts. The noble gas enables the arc&#x27;s initial strike. Once the arc is started, it heats and evaporates the metallic admixture. Its presence in the arc plasma greatly increases the intensity of visible light produced by the arc for a given power input, as the metals have many emission spectral lines in the visible part of the spectrum. High-intensity discharge lamps are a type of arc lamp.

Brand new high-intensity discharge lamps make more visible light per unit of electric power consumed than fluorescent and incandescent lamps, since a greater proportion of their radiation is visible light in contrast to infrared. However, the lumen output of HID lighting can deteriorate by up to 70% over 10,000 burning hours.

Many modern vehicles use HID bulbs for the main lighting systems, although some applications are now moving from HID bulbs to LED and laser technology.

== Construction ==

Various types of chemistry are used in the arc tubes of HID lamps, depending on the desired characteristics of light intensity, correlated color temperature, color rendering index (CRI), energy efficiency, and lifespan. Varieties of HID lamp include:
*Mercury-vapor lamps
*Metal-halide (MH) lamps
*Ceramic MH lamps
*Sodium-vapor lamps
*Xenon short-arc lamps

The light-producing element of these lamp types is a well-stabilized arc discharge contained within a refractory envelope arc tube with wall loading in excess of .

Mercury-vapor lamps were the first commercially available HID lamps. Originally they produced a bluish-green light, but more recent versions can produce light with a less pronounced color tint. However, mercury-vapor lamps are falling out of favor and being replaced by sodium-vapor and metal-halide lamps.

Metal-halide and ceramic metal-halide lamps can be made to give off neutral white light useful for applications where normal color appearance is critical, such as TV and movie production, indoor or nighttime sports games, automotive headlamps, and aquarium lighting.

Low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps are extremely efficient. They produce a deep yellow-orange light and have an effective CRI of nearly zero; items viewed under their light appear monochromatic. This makes them particularly effective as photographic safelights. High-pressure sodium lamps tend to produce a much whiter light, but still with a characteristic orange-pink cast. New color-corrected versions producing a whiter light are now available, but some efficiency is sacrificed for the improved color.
Like fluorescent lamps, HID lamps require a ballast to start and maintain their arcs. The method used to initially strike the arc varies: mercury-vapor lamps and some metal-halide lamps are usually started using a third electrode near one of the main electrodes, while other lamp styles are usually started using pulses of high voltage.

Replacements for the toxic mercury in the HID lamps have been investigated and are a matter of ongoing research. Experiments show promising results and widespread future applications are expected.

== Radioactive substances ==
Some HID lamps make use of radioactive substances such as krypton-85 and thorium. These isotopes help start the lamps and improve lamp operating characteristics.

Krypton-85 is a gas and is found mixed in with the argon, which is in the arc tube of the lamp. The thorium, which is a solid, is used in the electrodes.

These isotopes produce ionizing radiation of alpha and beta type. This radiation causes high ionization inside the lamp without being able to escape from the lamp. High ionisation makes arc starting via Townsend avalanche much easier. Moreover, the presence of thorium in electrodes reduces the work function which again results in easier arc starting and sustaining.

The amount of gamma radiation produced by the isotopes that can escape from the lamp is negligible.

== Applications ==

HID lamps are typically used when high levels of light over large areas are required, and when energy efficiency and/or light intensity are desired. These areas include gymnasiums, large public areas, warehouses, movie theatres, football stadiums, outdoor activity areas, roadways, parking lots, and pathways. More recently, HID lamps have been used in small retail and even residential environments because of advances in reduced lumen bulbs. Ultra-high performance (UHP) HID lamps are used in LCD or DLP projection TV sets or projection displays as well.

HID lamps have made indoor gardening practical, particularly for plants that require high levels of direct sunlight in their natural habitat; HID lamps, specifically metal-halide and high-pressure sodium, are a common light source for indoor gardens. They are also used to reproduce tropical intensity sunlight for indoor aquaria.

Most HID lamps produce significant UV radiation and require UV-blocking filters to prevent UV-induced degradation of lamp fixture components and fading of dyed items illuminated by the lamp. Exposure to HID lamps operating with faulty or absent UV-blocking filters causes injury to humans and animals, such as sunburn and arc eye. Many HID lamps are designed to quickly extinguish if their outer UV-shielding glass envelope is broken.

Beginning in the early 1990s, HID lamps have seen applications in automotive headlamps. Xenon, or high-intensity discharge (HID), lighting provides brighter headlights and increases visibility of many peripheral objects (e.g. street signs and pedestrians) left in the shadows by standard halogen lighting. However, the bright headlights have given rise to complaints about glare.

HID lamps are used in high-performance bicycle headlamps, as well as flashlights and other portable lights, because they produce a great amount of light per unit of power. As the HID lights use less than half the power of an equivalent tungsten-halogen light, a significantly smaller and lighter-weight power supply can be used.

HID lamps have also become common on many aircraft as replacements for traditional landing and taxi lights.

HID lamps are also used in lamps for underwater diving. The higher efficacy of HID lamps compared to halogen units means longer burn times for a given battery size and light output.

== Color Temperatures ==
HID lamps are available in a variety of colors (commonly referred to as color temperatures) and measured in Kelvins (K). The Kelvin color temperature scale ranges from 1000K (amber) to 3000K (yellow) to 5500K (white) to 8000K (blue) to 12000K (purple).

HID lamps produce different colors of light primarily through the use of various metal additives in the lamp&#x27;s arc tube and the physics of the gas discharge process.

* Metal Additives: HID lamps contain an arc tube filled with a mixture of gases, including a noble gas (like xenon). These metal additives are crucial for producing different colors of light. Different metals emit light at specific wavelengths when energized, and this characteristic determines the lamp&#x27;s color output.
* Gas Discharge Process: The lamp&#x27;s operation involves creating an electric arc across the electrodes within the arc tube. This arc generates intense heat and excites the gases and metal additives within the tube. As the excited atoms return to their ground state, they release energy in the form of light.
* Spectrum Emission: The specific spectrum of light emitted depends on the energy levels of the excited atoms and the properties of the metal additives. Each metal emits light at certain wavelengths, resulting in specific colors
* Phosphor Coating: Some HID lamps, like Mercury Vapor lamps, also utilize phosphor coatings on the inner surface of the arc tube. These phosphors absorb the ultraviolet (UV) light emitted by the excited gas atoms and then re-emit visible light. The combination of UV light and the emitted visible light creates a broader spectrum of colors.
* Color Rendering Index (CRI): HID lamps are not always known for their excellent color rendering properties. Color rendering refers to how accurately the light source displays the true colors of objects compared to natural sunlight. Different HID lamps have varying CRI values, with some providing better color rendering than others.
The choice of metal additives and their concentrations enables lamp manufacturers to create HID lamps with distinct color temperatures and spectral characteristics to meet different lighting needs.

The majority of HID lamps are produced in the color temperature range of 5000K to 6000K, which is similar to natural daylight. This is useful for applications requiring high levels of luminosity such as sport stadiums, warehouses, projection TVs, and gardening lights.

However, for certain applications such as automotive headlamps, HID lamps are produced in nearly every color from yellow and white to blue and purple.

== End of life ==
Factors of wear come mostly from on/off cycles versus the total on time. The highest wear occurs when the HID burner is ignited while still hot and before the metallic salts have recrystallized.

At the end of life, many types of high-intensity discharge lamps exhibit a phenomenon known as &quot;cycling&quot;. These lamps can be started at a relatively low voltage. As they heat up during operation, however, the internal gas pressure within the arc tube rises and a higher voltage is required to maintain the arc discharge. As a lamp gets older, the voltage necessary to maintain the arc eventually rises to exceed the voltage provided by the electrical ballast. As the lamp heats to this point, the arc fails and the lamp goes out. Eventually, with the arc extinguished, the lamp cools down again, the gas pressure in the arc tube is reduced, and the ballast can once again cause the arc to strike. The effect of this is that the lamp glows for a while and then goes out, repeatedly. More sophisticated ballast designs detect cycling and give up attempting to start the lamp after a few cycles. If power is removed and reapplied, the ballast will make a new series of startup attempts.

Another phenomenon associated with HID lamp wear and aging is discoloration of the emitted light beam (&quot;fading&quot;). Commonly, a shift towards blue and/or violet can be observed. This shift is slight at first and is more generally a sign of the lamps being &quot;broken in&quot; whilst still being in good overall working order, but towards the end of its life, the HID lamp is often perceived as &quot;only&quot; producing blue and violet light. Based on Planck&#x27;s law, this is a direct result of the increased voltage and higher temperature necessary to maintain the arc.

Sometimes the quartz tube containing mercury can explode in a UHP lamp. When that happens, up to 50 mg of mercury vapor is released into the atmosphere. This quantity of mercury is potentially toxic, but the main hazard from broken lamps is glass cuts, and occasional exposure to broken lamps is not expected to have adverse effects. Philips recommends the use of a mercury vacuum cleaner, ventilation or respiratory protection, eye protection, and protective clothing when dealing with broken lamps. Mercury lamps always require specialised disposal or recycling, which is legally mandatory in many locations depending on jurisdiction.

<text>George Vernon Hudson FRSNZ (20 April 1867 – 5 April 1946) was a British-born New Zealand entomologist credited with proposing the modern daylight saving time. He was awarded the Hector Memorial Medal in 1923.

==Biography==
Born in London, Britain, on Easter Saturday, 1867 Hudson was the sixth child of Emily Jane Carnal and Charles Hudson, an artist and stained-glass window designer. By the age of 14 he had built up a collection of British insects, and had published a paper in &quot;The Entomologist&quot;. In 1881 Hudson moved with his father to Nelson, New Zealand. He worked on a farm, and in 1883, aged 16, he began working at the post office in Wellington, where he eventually became chief clerk, retiring in 1918.

Hudson was a member of the 1907 Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition. Its main aim was to extend the magnetic survey of New Zealand by investigating the Auckland and Campbell islands but botanical, biological, and zoological surveys were also conducted. The expedition also rescued castaways from the &quot;Dundonald&quot;, which had been shipwrecked in the Auckland Islands.

Hudson is credited with proposing modern-day daylight saving time. His shift-work job gave him leisure time to collect insects, and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895, he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. In 1933, Hudson was the first recipient (together with Ernest Rutherford) of the T. K. Sidey Medal, set up by the Royal Society of New Zealand from funds collected to commemorate the passing of the Summer-Time Act 1927.

Another Briton, William Willett, championed the use of daylight saving time. It was made law there in 1916.

Hudson&#x27;s collection of insects, the largest in New Zealand, is housed in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Between 1881 and 1946, Hudson recorded information in three handwritten volumes that described thousands of species, inventing his own coding system. In 2018, Te Papa launched a crowd-sourcing project calling for digital volunteers to help decipher those codes, which will then allow conservation entomologists to compare Hudson&#x27;s records with the status of those same insects today.

==Honours and awards==
* 1919 – Original Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand
* 1923 – Hector Medal
* 1929 – Hutton Medal

<text>Shirvan (from ; ; Tat: &quot;Şirvan&quot;) is a historical region in the eastern Caucasus, as known in both pre-Islamic Sasanian and Islamic times. Today, the region is an industrially and agriculturally developed part of the Republic of Azerbaijan that stretches between the western shores of the Caspian Sea and the Kura River, centered on the Shirvan Plain.

==History==
===Etymology===

Vladimir Minorsky believes that names such as Sharvān (Shirwān), Lāyzān and Baylaqān are Iranian names from the Iranian languages of the coast of the Caspian Sea.

There are several explanations about this name:
* Shirvan or Sharvan are corrupted forms of the word &quot;Shahrbān&quot; () which means &quot;the governor&quot;. The word &quot;Shahrban&quot; has been used since Achaemenian Dynasty as &quot;Xshathrapawn&quot; (satrap) to refer to different states of the kingdom.
* Shervan in Persian means cypress tree (the same as &#x27;sarv&#x27; in Middle Persian and in New Persian, as well as in Arabic). It is also used as a male name. 
* It is connected popularly to Anushirvan, the Sasanian King.

However, Said Nafisi points out that according to Khaqani&#x27;s poems, where Khaqani contrasts his home town with kheyrvān (), the original and correct pronunciation of the name was Sharvān. So all etymologies relating this name to sher/shir (lion in Persian) or Anushiravan are most probably folk etymology and not based on historical facts. The form Shervān or Shirvān are from later centuries. According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, Shirwan proper comprised the easternmost spurs of the Caucasus range and the lands which sloped down from these mountains to the banks of the Kur river. But its rulers strove continuously to control also the western shores of the Caspian Sea from Ḳuba (the modern town of Quba) in the district of Maskat in the north, to Baku in the south. To the north of all these lands lay Bab al-Abwab or Derbend, and to the west, beyond the modern Goychay, the region of Shaki. In mediaeval Islamic times, and apparently in pre-Islamic Sāsānid ones also, Shirwan included the district of Layzan, which probably corresponds to modern Lahidj, often ruled as a separate fief by a collateral branch of the Yazidi Shirwan Shahs.&quot;

The 19th century native historian and writer Abbasgulu Bakikhanov defines it as: &quot;The country of Shirvan to the east borders on the Caspian Sea, and to the south on the river Kur, which separates it from the provinces of Moghan and Armenia&quot;.

===Shirvanshahs===

Shirvanshah also spelled as Shīrwān Shāh or Sharwān Shāh, was the title in medieval Islamic times of a Persianized dynasty of Arabic origin. They ruled the area independently or as a vassal of larger empires from 809 A.D. up to 1607 A.D. when Safavid rule became firmly established.

===Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar eras===
When the Shirvanshah Shah dynasty was ended by the Safavid Shah Tahmasp I, Shirwan formed a province of the Safavids and was usually governed by a Khan, who is often called Beylerbey. Shirvan was taken by the Ottomans in 1578; however, Safavid rule was restored by 1607. In 1722, during the Russo-Persian War (1722–1723), the Khan of Quba, Husayn Ali, submitted to Peter the Great and was accepted as his dignitary. The Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1723) forced the Iranian king to recognise the Russian annexation. By the treaty between the Russian and Ottoman Empires in the year 1724, the coast of the territory of Baku, which was occupied by the Russians, was separated from the rest of Shirvan, which was left to the Ottomans. It was only when Nader Shah defeated the Ottomans (1735) that the Russians ceded back the coastal land and the other areas in the North and South Caucasus as conquered in 1722–1723 from Safavid Iran conform the Treaties of Resht and Ganja, and the area became part of the Afsharid Empire, by which century long Iranian rule was restored.

===Qajar Iran to the Azerbaijan SSR===
When the Qajars had succeeded in restoring the unity of Persia, the sons of the Khan were no more able to maintain their independence like the other Caucasian chiefs and had to choose between Russia and Persia. The Khan of Shirwan, Mustafa, who had already entered into negotiations with Zubov, submitted to the Russians in 1805, who occupied the Persian cities of Derbend and Baku the next year (1806) during the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), but soon afterwards he made overtures to the Persians and sought help from them. By the Treaty of Gulistan (12/24 October 1813) following the end of the 1804–1813 war, Persia was forced to cede its territories and regions comprising Darband, Quba, Shirwan and Baku, while giving up all claims on them as well. Nevertheless, Mustafa continued to have secret dealings with Persia. It was not until 1820 that his territory was occupied by Russian troops; the Khan fled to Persia and Shemakha was irrevocably incorporated in Russian territory. Iranian anger while being dissatisfied with losing swaths of its integral territories in the North and South Caucasus subsequently sparked the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), which resulted in another Iranian loss, as well as the ceding of its last remaining territories in the Caucasus comprising what is now Armenia, and southern parts of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan. The Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828 officially ratified the forced ceding of these Iranian territories to Imperial Russia, while it would also mark the official end of millennia long intertwined Iranian hegemony, rule, and influence over the Caucasus region, including Shirvan.

==People and culture==

The term Shirvani/Shirvanli is still in use in Azerbaijan to designate the people of Shirvan region, as it was historically. In ancient times, the bulk of the population of Shirvan were Caucasian-speaking groups. Later on Iranization of this native population and subsequent Turkification since the Seljuq era occurred. The bulk of the population today are Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis, although there are also smaller Caucasian-speaking and Iranian-speaking minorities.

===Caucasian population===
The original population were Paleo-Caucasians and spoke Caucasian languages, like the Caucasian Albanians. Today, other Daghestani Caucasian languages such as Udi, Lezgian and Avar are still spoken in the region.

===Iranian influence and population===
Iranian penetration started since the Achaemenid era and continued in the Parthian era. However it was during the Sassanid era that the influence really increased and Persian colonies were set up in the region. According to Vladimir Minorsky: &quot;The presence of Iranian settlers in Transcaucasia, and especially in the proximity of the passes, must have played an important role in absorbing and pushing back the aboriginal inhabitants. Such names as Sharvan, Layzan, Baylaqan, etc., suggest that the Iranian immigration proceeded chiefly from Gilan and other regions on the southern coast of the Caspian.&quot; Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn Al-Masudi (896–956), the Arab historian states Persian presence in Aran, Bayleqan, Darband, Shabaran, Masqat and Jorjan. From 
the 9th century, the urban population of Shirwan increasingly spoke Persian, while the rural population seems to mostly have retained their old Caucasian languages. Up to the nineteenth century, there was still a large number of Tat people (who claim to be descendants of Sassanid era Persian settlers), however due to their similar culture and religion with the Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis, this population was partly assimilated.

===Turkification of the region===
Turkic penetration in the region started in the Khazar era, however there are no unambiguous references to settlements. The Turkification of the region started in the Seljuq era, although the area in parallel maintained its Persian culture under the Persianized Shirvanshah until the Safavid era. From the Safavid era onwards, the Turkification of the region accelerated with new wave of Turkoman settlements.

<text>Radical Women (RW) is an American socialist feminist grassroots activist organization affiliated with the Freedom Socialist Party. It has branches in Seattle, Washington, and Melbourne, Australia.

==History==
Radical Women emerged in Seattle from a &quot;Free University&quot; class on Women and Society conducted by Gloria Martin, a lifelong communist and civil rights champion. As a result of the class, Martin teamed up with Clara Fraser and Melba Windoffer (initiators of the Freedom Socialist Party) and Susan Stern (a prominent figure in the local Students for a Democratic Society) to launch Radical Women in 1967.

In &quot;Socialist Feminism: The First Decade, 1966-76&quot; Martin writes that the new group was formed to &quot;demonstrate that women could act politically, learn and teach theory, administer an organization, develop indigenous leadership, and focus movement and community attention on the sorely neglected matter of women&#x27;s rights—and that women could do this on their own.&quot;

Radical Women participated heavily in the anti-Vietnam War mobilization, and has opposed subsequent military interventions initiated by Western countries.
Members worked with African-American women from anti-poverty programs to initiate the abortion rights movement in Washington State with a historic march on the capitol in 1969.

In the early 1970s, RW helped organize a strike and a union of low-paid employees (mostly female) at the University of Washington.

After working closely with the Freedom Socialist Party (FSP), Radical Women and the party formally affiliated in 1973 on the basis of a shared socialist feminist program. Some of its early members, such as Lynda Schraufnagel, were employed by the FSP&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Freedom Socialist&quot;, and also wrote for it.

Many Radical Women members worked and organized in the nontraditional trades. At Seattle&#x27;s public power company, Seattle City Light, Clara Fraser was recruited to craft and implement the country&#x27;s first plan to train women as utility electricians. Three other members of Radical Women, Megan Cornish, Heidi Durham, and Teri Bach, participated in the program and went on to become some of the first women electricians in the country. Just weeks before the program began, however, Fraser participated in a walkout against new rules issued by City Light superintendent Gordon Vickery, which soured her relations with management. After their training, Cornish, Durham, and Bach were laid off in 1975 in an act seen largely as retaliatory against themselves and Fraser. The three women filed a lawsuit alleging discrimination on the basis of sex, and after a year a court ruled in their favor and ordered their reinstatement. Fraser was also laid off in 1975, and she filed her own separate lawsuit alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and political ideology. After a seven-year legal battle and a massive public relations campaign, Fraser won her reinstatement at City Light.
In 1991, two members of Radical Women, Heidi Durham and Yolanda Alaniz, ran for Seattle City Council as members of the FSP. The two campaigned together on demands for guaranteed income for families living in poverty, domestic partnership rights for same-sex couples, and community control of the police. Alaniz advanced to the general election and finished with 21% of the vote.

==Purpose and ideology==

&quot;The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure&quot; defines Radical Women&#x27;s purpose and ideology as follows:

Radical Women is dedicated to exposing, resisting, and eliminating the inequities of women&#x27;s existence. To accomplish this task of insuring survival for an entire sex, we must simultaneously address ourselves to the social and material source of sexism: the capitalist form of production and distribution of products, characterized by intrinsic class, race, sex, and caste oppression. When we work for the revolutionary transformation of capitalism into a socialist society, we work for a world in which all people may enjoy the right of full humanity and freedom from poverty, war, racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and repression.

Radical Women takes a multi-racial, multi-issue, working class and anti-capitalist approach to women&#x27;s liberation. It advocates for free abortion on demand, an end to forced sterilization of women of color, and for affordable, quality, 24-hour childcare. Early efforts include the Action Childcare Coalition, the Feminist Coordinating Council (an umbrella organization made up of the whole spectrum of women&#x27;s groups in Seattle), and the Coalition for Protective Legislation (a labor and feminist effort to extend female-designated workplace safeguards to men after passage of the Washington State Equal Rights Amendment).

Radical Women has played a leading role in lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender liberation struggles. Members have helped build militant lesbian/gay rights organizations and have been involved in many coalitions devoted to preventing forced AIDS testing, opposing ballot-box attacks on gay rights, lobbying for state gay rights bills, and more. In the 1980s Radical Women leader Merle Woo, a college lecturer, writer and Asian American lesbian spokesperson, won a case against the University of California at Berkeley, which had fired her, charging discrimination on race, sex, sexuality, and political ideology.

<doc id="877196" wikidata="Q7256482" url="?curid=877196" title="Psychosexual disorder">
<text>Psychosexual disorder is a sexual problem that is psychological, rather than physiological in origin. &quot;Psychosexual disorder&quot; was a term used in Freudian psychology. The term &quot;psychosexual disorder&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Psikoseksüel bozukluk&quot;) has been used by the TAF for homosexuality as a reason to ban the LGBT people from military service.

==Paraphilias==

Paraphilias are generally defined as psychosexual disorders in which significant distress or an impairment in a domain of functioning results from recurrent intense sexual urges, fantasies or behaviors generally involving an unusual object, activity, or situation. An alternative definition is given by the DSM-5 which labels them as sexual; attractions to objects, situations or people that deviate from the desires and sexual behaviors that are considered to be socially acceptable. Examples of these paraphilias would include fetishism, sexual masochism and sadism and more.

===Fetishism and transvestic fetishism===

Fetishism is a disorder that is characterized by a sexual fixation, fantasies or behaviors toward an inanimate object, these objects frequently are articles of clothing. It is only through this object which the individual can achieve sexual gratification. It is not rare that an individual will rub or smell the object. This disorder is more common in males and it is not understood why.

Transvestic fetishism also commonly known as transvestism, is a diagnoses found in the DSM. There are four factors that revolve around this syndrome. These include cross-dressing, being associated with sexual arousal, in a biological male, and the person has to be a heterosexual male.

===Sexual sadism and sexual masochism===

The disorders known as sexual sadism and sexual masochism are oftentimes confused or hard to separate when their definitions are compared but diagnostic criteria differ slightly between the two and allows for more easy classification. Sexual sadism disorder and sexual masochism are defined as receiving sexual arousal from the humiliation, pain and or suffering of an individual and are thought to overlap with multiple other conditions due to its description along with diagnostic criteria.

===Voyeurism, exhibitionism and frotteurism===

Voyeurism is self-reported sexual arousal from spying on others or the observation of others who are engaged in sexual interaction.

Exhibitionism are public acts of exposing parts of one&#x27;s body that are not socially acceptable to be exposed. Exhibitionistic acts are among the most common of the potentially law-breaking sexual behaviors. Examples of this would include &quot;streaking&quot; during a professional sporting event or protesting a political event in the nude.

Frotteurism is considered a rare paraphilia that revolves around an individual&#x27;s sexual satisfaction being derived from rubbing upon another non-consenting individual. The term frotteurism itself can be broken down and derived from the French verb &quot;frotter&quot; which means rubbing.

==Diagnosis==

In the DSM-5 all paraphilia disorders can be diagnosed by two main criteria that are referred to criteria A and criteria B respectively. The A and B criteria include a duration in which the behavior must be present for (typically six months) and specific details of actions or thoughts that are correlated specifically with the respective disorder being diagnosed.

==Treatment==
Psychosexual disorders can vary greatly in severity and treatability. Medical professionals and licensed therapists are necessary in diagnosis and treatment plans. Treatment can vary from therapy to prescription medication. Sex therapy, behavioral therapy, and group therapy may be helpful to those distressed by sexual dysfunction. More serious sexual disorders may be treated with androgen blockers or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to help restore hormonal and neurochemical balances.

==History==

===Sigmund Freud===
Sigmund Freud has contributed to the idea of psychosexual disorders and furthered research of the topic through his ideas of psychosexual development and his psychoanalytic sex drive theory. According to Freud&#x27;s ideas of psychosexual development, as a child, one will progress through five stages of development. These stages being the oral stage (1 -1 1/2 yrs), the anal stage(1 1/2- 3yrs) phallic stage (3-5 yrs), the latency stage (5-12 yrs) and the genital stage (from puberty on). A psychosexual disorder could arise in an individual if the individual does not progress through these stages properly. Proper progression through these stages requires the correct amounts of stimulation and gratification at each stage. If there is too little stimulation at a certain stage fixation occurs and becoming overly fixated could lead to a psychosexual disorder. In contrast, too much stimulation at a certain stage of development could lead to regression when that individual is in distress, also possibly leading to a psychosexual disorder.

===Richard Freiherr von Kraft-Ebing===

Richard Krafft-Ebing was a German psychiatrist who sought to revolutionize sexuality in the late nineteenth century. Working in a time of sexual modesty, Krafft-Ebing brought light to sexuality as an innate human nature verses deviancy. His most notable work, &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;, was a collection of case studies highlighting sexual practices of the general public. The textbook was the first of its kind recognizing the variation within human sexuality, such as: nymphomania, fetishism, and homosexuality. Psychiatrists were now able to diagnose psychosexual disorders in place of perversions. &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot; was used as reference in psychological, medical, and judicial settings. Krafft-Ebing is considered the founder of medical sexology; he is the predecessor of both Sigmund Freud and Havelock Ellis.

===Havelock Ellis===
Havelock Ellis was an English physician and writer born in the eighteen hundreds who studied human sexuality, and is referred to as one of the earliest sexologists. Ellis&#x27;s work was geared towards human sexual behavior. His major work was a seven-volume publication called &quot;Studies in the Psychology of Sex&quot;, which related sex to society. Published in 1921, &quot;Studies in the Psychology of Sex&quot; covered the evolution of modesty, sexual periodicity, auto-erotism, sexual inversion, sexual impulse, sexual selection, and erotic symbolism. Ellis also conceived the term eonism, which references a man dressing as a woman. He elaborated on this term in his publication of &quot;Eonism and Other Supplementary Studies.&quot; He wrote &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot; as well in hopes to address any ignorance people have on the topic.

<text>The Radical Democratic Party () is a liberal party in Bulgaria. The party was founded in 1902 (other sources: 1905) by Naičo Canov and other dissidents from the Democratic Party. From 1918 party was led by Stoyan Kosturkov. It was banned in 1934, revived in 1944 and again banned in 1949.
In 1989 the party was re-established. It elected as its leader Elka Konstantinova. She was succeeded in 1994 by Aleksander Jordanov, and the party became an affiliated member of the Union of Democratic Forces. In 1995 the party split, with one faction remaining inside the Union of Democratic Forces, and another faction becoming an independent party. Though the party still exists, it lacks its former influence.

<text>In mathematics, the butterfly lemma or Zassenhaus lemma, named after Hans Zassenhaus, is a technical result on the lattice of subgroups of a group or the lattice of submodules of a module, or more generally for any modular lattice.

:Lemma. Suppose formula_1 is a group with subgroups formula_2 and formula_3. Suppose formula_4 and formula_5 are normal subgroups. Then there is an isomorphism of quotient groups:
::formula_6

This can be generalized to the case of a group with operators formula_7 with stable subgroups formula_2 and formula_3, the above statement being the case of formula_10 acting on itself by conjugation.

Zassenhaus proved this lemma specifically to give the most direct proof of the Schreier refinement theorem. The &#x27;butterfly&#x27; becomes apparent when trying to draw the Hasse diagram of the various groups involved.

Zassenhaus&#x27; lemma for groups can be derived from a more general result known as Goursat&#x27;s theorem stated in a Goursat variety (of which groups are an instance); however the group-specific modular law also needs to be used in the derivation.

<text>The River aux Sables, also known as the Aux Sables River and the Rivière aux Sables, is a river in Algoma and Sudbury Districts, Ontario, Canada, which flows from Lac aux Sables in Algoma District and empties into the Spanish River near the community of Massey.

The river is a well documented canoe route and notable for its free-flowing drainage and challenging whitewater. In particular, the southern portion of the river, with Class III and IV rapids, is renowned for white-water kayaking.

At one time, the river was used to transport logs to sawmills downstream. Just before its mouth, it flows through Chutes Provincial Park, which was named after chutes used to bypass rapids on this river. The river is now mainly used for recreational canoeing and kayaking.

Ontario Highway 810 follows the course of the river from Richie Falls in the north, south of Lac aux Sables, to Bull Lake in the south. Ontario Highway 553 continues south from there to Massey on Ontario Highway 17, first diverging from and then rejoining the river just north of Massey.

==River aux Sables Provincial Park==
The River aux Sables Provincial Park protects the entire river and its banks with the exception of some private lands near the town of Massey. It was established in 2006 and is intended to provide recreational paddling opportunities. The park area is also popular for fishing, hunting, and camping.

The park is a natural corridor, abutting the Mississagi River Provincial Park Additions in the north, and linked to Chutes Provincial Park in the south. One notable feature of the park is the riparian wetland in Tennyson Township, which has a complex arrangement of oxbow ponds and abandoned river channels with a wide variety of aquatic and marsh vegetation, and is home to migratory and breeding marsh birds and waterfowl.

It is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no facilities or services.

For more than twenty years the Rangiora Showgrounds has hosted an annual &quot;petrol-head&quot; show called Street Machines and Muscle Car Madness which features a large array of vehicles.

In 1956, Rangiora hosted New Zealand&#x27;s first traction engine rally at the Rangiora Showgrounds. Eight traction engines, owned by members of the Southbrook Traction Engine Club, attended. In 2006, this notable milestone was celebrated by the arrival of visiting Burrell showman&#x27;s engine &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; and accompanying carousel &quot;Gallopers Abreast&quot; from England to attend the celebrations.

==Sports==

Rangiora Football has undergone strong growth recently. The Mainpower Oval has hosted many national cricket matches and is also used by Canterbury Country cricket as its base. Rangiora High School has produced many excellent sportspeople in rugby, basketball, netball, athletics, and rowing in recent years. Former All Black captain Todd Blackadder and former Silver Fern player and Tall Fern captain Donna Loffhagen both attended Rangiora High School.

==Culture==

Rangiora boasts two theatre companies: The North Canterbury Musical Society and The Rangiora Players. There are also a number of music, dance and drama schools based in the town, including the Hartley School of Performing Arts. The Regent Cinema, which opened in 1926, was located within the historic Rangiora Town Hall from its opening in 1926 as Everybodys&#x27; Cinema until December 2012 when the Town Hall was closed. There were also screenings in the larger auditorium which also hosted live shows and youth events.

The studios of radio station Compass FM 104.9 are situated in Rangiora. Compass FM 104.9 is a not-for-profit community station covering the North Canterbury region of New Zealand. From a transmitter atop Mount Grey, the station can be heard over much of North Canterbury, including the Waimakariri District, much of the Hurunui District and Selwyn District, and in greater Christchurch.

===Rangiora Town Hall===
The Rangiora Town Hall was designed by Henry St. Aubyn Murray on the behalf of the Rangiora Borough Council, and built by F.Williamson of Christchurch at a cost of £10,850 NZP. Construction began in 1925, and the Hall was opened on 27 May 1926 by the Mayoress of the Rangiora Borough, Mrs Robina McIntosh. Seating 600, the main hall was designed to host both moving pictures, and also live performances from around the district. The original Rangiora Public Library was located on the first-floor along the northern (High Street) frontage. Originally the Rangiora Borough Council resolved to spend only £6,500 to build and furnish the hall, was obliged to loan some £8,000 from the Christchurch Tramway Board to finance the construction of the hall, outraging residents at the prospects of having to pay increased rates. The interior furnishings were paid for using the insurance monies from the Institute Hall, which had been burned down in 1926.

The building originally housed the Everybodys Theatre, from 1931 the Regent Theatre. The former ticket windows were located on either side of the main doors; these are still extant, though the windows have since been replaced with single panes of glass, and the internal walls of one of the ticket offices has been removed. The Hall also housed the library from 1926 to 1967, when it moved to the former Council Chambers. The Rangiora Borough Council occupied the former library space from 1967 to 1981, when the present Council offices were opened on the (former) Institute Hall property.

The building has been altered very few times since it was originally built. In the early 1970s, the building was altered by pushing the rear wall of the auditorium in, which resulted in the loss of 200 seats and reducing the current capacity to the present level of 380. With the introduction of television and video, the former library on the first-floor was converted in 1983 into a smaller second theatre, designed solely as a movie theatre, and which opened with the movie &quot;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi&quot;. The main theatre was still capable of showing movies as required, and the original projection room was still in place to facilitate hire of the main hall to show movies for special occasions until September 2013. The building has been shut down twice for work to be carried out; in 1999 access was improved to the fly floors and the present lighting gantry installed, and in 2009 the building received an electrical re-wire and the interior was refurbished.

At some point in the 1920s-1930s, two properties adjacent to the Town Hall along High Street were demolished, and the site turned into the Town Hall Reserve; this property separates the Town Hall and the Police Station, built in 1999 to replace another station that had become inadequate. There is also a small carpark to the south of the building, behind the stage area. This carpark also has a loading dock that leads directly into the stage right wing, allowing backdrops and other properties to be brought into the building.

In September 2010, the Town Hall was damaged by the 4 September earthquake. The last group to use the Town Hall was the Rangiora New Life School, whose Secondary students had performed &quot;Exodus - The Musical&quot; (written by Christopher Tambling and Michael Forster) over the week of 25–27 August. The building was out of service until mid-2011, when it was reopened for use again. While it had been undergoing repairs at the time of the 22 February earthquake, the building thankfully did not sustain any further damage, which would have prolonged the time required for repairs.

The first show to use the restored facility was the North Canterbury Musical Society with their performance of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; in June 2011. While the Hall appeared to be in good condition, it was later found by engineers to be below the 33% structural integrity requirements of the New Building Standards code introduced after the Canterbury earthquakes. In December 2011, Council engineers closed the Hall, necessitating the closure of the Regent Theatre, located in the former library.

The Regent Theatre, operated by Patrick Walsh, was relocated to the Waikari Town Hall, a temporary move which was later made permanent by the cancellation of Walsh&#x27;s concession to operate the movie theatre in mid-2013. After Walsh stripped out his cinema, contractors Naylor Love began work on 16 September 2013 to demolish internal walls as part of a new Performing Arts centre, due to cost $10.9m NZD. Walsh&#x27;s cinema closed on 31 October 2013 and may not return to the Town Hall.

The refurbished Town Hall was officially opened on 7 March 2015 by Waimakariri District mayor David Ayers, with the Rangiora Brass Band providing a short concert afterwards. The refurbished facility consists of the main auditorium seating 361 patrons, a multi-purpose hall seating 150, and two small cinemas. The multi-use hall is also equipped with cinema equipment, permitting three movies to be presented simultaneously. The cinema facility is branded &quot;Town Hall Cinemas&quot;. In addition, the facility also houses four &quot;studios&quot;, which are used by the North Canterbury Academy of Music for music teaching purposes for 36 weeks each year. There is also a function room and a green room.

The Rangiora Town Hall was registered by the Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place on 6 September 1984. The Rangiora Town Hall is also listed on the council&#x27;s Landmarks scheme. It received its Landmark status on 27 May 2010.

===Heritage Precinct===

Unofficially the High Street of Rangiora stretching from the Rangiora Town Hall at King Street up to Ashley Street is a &#x27;heritage precinct&#x27; due to the presence of many historic buildings. Among them are the former Junction Hotel (1880), the Post Office (1936), the Farmers building (1919) and the Johnston Building (1896). Some of these buildings are listed under the council&#x27;s Landmarks heritage scheme, along with the Town Hall.

Due to the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes, several buildings have been fenced off due to safety concerns. This has caused people to go elsewhere for shopping, thus &#x27;killing&#x27; High Street. In 2012, it was confirmed that one non-heritage registered building, the Lamberts Building, would be demolished, while the fate of others remains unknown. The building was demolished in August 2012. Several notable items recovered during the work were donated by the contractor to the Rangiora Museum.

The fate of the former Junction Hotel (1880) and the neighbouring Pulley&#x27;s Building (1923) was presently unknown as of September 2012. The lessor of a restaurant operating from the Junction Hotel has indicated an interest in purchasing the two properties and demolishing them to build a more modern structure. The Farmers building (1919), having initially survived the earthquakes, was demolished over July and August 2014. One other non-heritage building, formerly home to Paper Plus and Toyworld, has been demolished because it was earthquake-prone.

Since then, demolition work has begun on the Pulley&#x27;s Building which was demolished on Thursday 28 February 2013. The fate of the Junction Hotel is yet undecided, necessitating the fence containing the structure to be left in place for the time being. The Farmers building is currently undergoing a thorough audit due to discrepancies in the owner&#x27;s report and in the report commissioned by the insurers. It is believed that more buildings may be demolished due to the costs of strengthening the buildings to meet structural requirements, and also to restore them as necessary.

==Museums==
Rangiora is home to its own museum, located next to the Rangiora Bowling Club at 29 Good Street. This museum constitutes the upper floor of the former BNZ bank building that was located on Rangiora&#x27;s High Street and shifted on to the current site in 1967. It contains items of historical interest from around the district. Later an extension consisting of a large display area and a collections archives room was added to the building.

The Rangiora and Districts Early Records Society, which operates the museum, was formed in 1960. Since its formation, the society has benefited from donations of some 5,000 objects and more than 11,000 photographs, and glass slides. The museum has become a repository for family histories, documents and photographs relating to those who settled in the area. These irreplaceable archives are of great value to those who are researching the history of Rangiora families.

The objectives of the Rangiora and Districts Early Records Society are to collect, study, preserve and display records, photographs and other material relating to the history of Rangiora and the surrounding district, to foster a knowledge of the history of Rangiora and the surrounding district among the Society&#x27;s members and the general public and to provide and operate a museum pertaining to that history.

The society hosts monthly meetings at the Rangiora Museum, where there are talks by members and visiting speakers on various topics of local historical and community interest.

A second museum, the Northbrook Museum, is located to the east of the town, adjacent to the Northbrook Chapel. This museum is a private undertaking, and is open by request with entry by donation. The collection is housed in four buildings, with the third building housing a collection of historic shop interiors from &#x27;heritage&#x27; Rangiora include a blacksmiths and the fourth housing a large collection of tractors. The museum grounds are also home to the former Rangiora Post Office clock tower, which was originally part of Rangiora&#x27;s first post office, which was demolished in 1936 to make way for the current building.

The Northbrook Museum has taken delivery of further historic artifacts which have been displaced by the Canterbury earthquakes. In February 2013, the museum took delivery of the former &#x27;Canterbury Draught&#x27; sign that had been located on top of the DB Breweries building in Christchurch. Plans have also been noted for a historic township to be constructed as part of the museum&#x27;s expansion.

The Herons&#x27; Steam Museum is located to the west of the town, past the Rangiora Racecourse. Although not listed as open to the public, the museum contains (or contained) a collection of industrial displays, working models and steam machinery including several traction engines, which have been restored at the museum and made regular gala appearances in the past. This museum has been owned by the Heron family since its inception in the 1970s, and entrance is by donation.

==Transport==
Rangiora is linked by Metro Route B which links Kaiapoi, Christchurch and Princess Margaret Hospital via Main North Road and Flaxton Road.
=== Rail ===
The Main North Line reached Rangiora as part of the Canterbury Provincial Railways&#x27; 5&#x27; 3&quot; gauge (1600mm) network that would eventually stretch north to Amberley. Southbrook was reached in July 1872, the extension to Rangiora being delayed by lack of chairs, until 5 November 1872. Rangiora was the terminus until the line was extended over the Ashley River bridge to Balcairn on 3 November 1875

A memorandum between the Resident Minister and the Superintendent of Canterbury specified that Rangiora and Kaiapoi should have station buildings of by , with verandas and including a booking office, ladies room, waiting room and luggage room, with platforms, urinals, closets, artesian wells and by goods sheds.

In 1875, a collision occurred between two trains at the Rangiora Station; although there were no fatalities, both engines were damaged as was some of the rolling stock involved.

In 1878, the railway was converted to the narrow gauge 3&#x27; 6&quot; (1067mm) chosen by Sir Julius Vogel for the New Zealand Railways.

From 1878 until 1959, Rangiora was also the junction for the Oxford Branch, which ran from Rangiora to Oxford West station. A photo taken in about 1900 shows a station building located between the main line and the branch, at right angles to the current station. The branch was constructed to tap the timber and agricultural resources of the Oxford area, connected with the Eyreton Branch at Bennetts Junction and at Oxford West for the short Malvern Branch (as it was then known), which connected the Oxford Branch to Sheffield on the Midland Line. This line, known for its high road-rail bridge across the Waimakariri Gorge, was closed in 1931 after years of spasmodic use. The Eyreton Branch connection at Bennetts was also closed in 1931.

The Oxford Branch itself closed in 1959, although the formation, several goods sheds (at Fernside and Springbank) and the former East Oxford Station (demolished in 1999) were left as reminders of the old railway. The original line ran down past the Plough Hotel on High Street; while there are no signs of this, the railway later ran down Blackett Street and so the street is noticeably wider than most streets as it had to accommodate both the railway and the street.

In 2002, the Waimakariri District Council re-erected station nameboards along the line as memorials to the railway, including one at Bells, on the intersection of High Street and the Rangiora-Oxford Road. It was also noted in 2006 that the former Bennetts railway station had been acquired from its use as the Cust cricket pavilion for restoration at Oxford.

Suburban trains ran between Christchurch and Rangiora between 1878 and 30 April 1976, when declining patronage caused New Zealand Railways to discontinue the service. The station has since been converted at various times into a garden centre, and more latterly, The Station Cafè. The building today comprises the former stationmaster&#x27;s office, waiting rooms, and lobby; originally built in an L-shape, the station has lost the extension which formerly held the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s toilets, and other offices. The railway yard has also been reduced in size with the closure of the Oxford Branch. The yard presently comprises the mainline and two loops, one of which is disused following a derailment which damaged the points at the northern end of the second loop.

In 1945, the Main North Line railway from Christchurch to Picton was completed, passing through Rangiora. Since 1945, passenger services have connected Rangiora with Christchurch and Picton; initially, this service was provided by Vulcan railcars up until 1978, when they were replaced by locomotive-hauled trains. The TranzCoastal, later rebranded as the Coastal Pacific, passes through Rangiora heading north in the morning and south again in the afternoon. This has recently been cut back to three trains each way per week in the off-peak season, following a similar format applied to the Overlander between Auckland and Wellington in 2006.

==Education==
The town has several primary schools and two secondary schools. They are:

*Ashgrove School, a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in the north-west of the town with a roll of students (as of The school opened in 1967.
*Rangiora Borough School, a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in the centre of the town with a roll of students (as of The school opened in 1873.
* St Joseph&#x27;s School, a state-integrated Catholic full primary (Year 1–8) school in the centre of the town with a roll of students (as of The school opened in 1887 as a private school and integrated into the state education system in the early 1980s.
* Te Matauru Primary, a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in the south-west of the town with a roll of students (as of The school opened in 2020.
* Rangiora High School, a state co-educational secondary school, which serves Rangiora and the surrounding area, with a roll of students (as of The school opened in 1884.
* Rangiora New Life School, a state-integrated Christian area school (year 1–13) situated in the Rangiora suburb of Southbrook. The school opened in 1979 as a private school and integrated into the state education system in the early 1990s. It has a roll of students (as of 

Population growth in the Rangiora area since the mid-2000s, especially following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, saw the town&#x27;s primary schools start to approach capacity. In response to this, Te Matauru Primary opened in January 2020.

<text>Mary Jane Rathbun (June 11, 1860 – April 4, 1943) was an American zoologist who specialized in crustaceans. She worked at the Smithsonian Institution from 1884 until her death. She described more than a thousand new species and subspecies and many higher taxa.

==Biography==
Mary Jane Rathbun was born on June 11, 1860, in Buffalo, New York, the youngest of five children of Charles Rathbun and Jane Furey. Her mother died when she was only one year old, and Mary was therefore &quot;thrown on her own resources.&quot; She was educated in Buffalo, graduating in 1878, but never attended college.

Rathbun was tall, and was noted for having a dry sense of humor.Rathbun first saw the ocean in 1881 when she accompanied her brother, Richard Rathbun, to Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He was employed as a scientific assistant to Addison Emery Verrill, alongside Verrill&#x27;s chief assistant, the carcinologist Sidney Irving Smith. Rathbun helped label, sort and record Smith&#x27;s specimens, and worked on crustaceans ever since. 
For three years, Rathbun worked on a voluntary basis for her brother, before being granted a clerkship by Spencer Fullerton Baird at the Smithsonian Institution.

After 28 years of working at the museum, Rathbun was promoted to assistant curator in charge of the Division of Crustacea. In 1915, after her retirement, the Smithsonian Institution designated Rathbun an &quot;Honorary Research Associate,&quot; and in 1916 she was granted an honorary master&#x27;s degree by the University of Pittsburgh. She qualified for a Ph.D. at George Washington University in 1917. Rathbun was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Washington Academy of Sciences, and the Wild Flower Preservation Society.

Rathbun died in Washington, D.C., on April 4, 1943, at the age of 82, from complications associated with a broken hip.

==Publications==
Rathbun&#x27;s first publication was co-written with James Everard Benedict and concerned the genus &quot;Panopeus&quot;; it was published in 1891. She officially retired on December 31, 1914, but did not stop working until her death. Her largest work was (&#x27;Freshwater Crabs&#x27;), which was originally intended as a single publication, but was eventually published in three volumes between 1904 and 1906.
She wrote or cowrote 166 papers in total, including descriptions of 1147 new species and subspecies, 63 new genera, one subfamily, 3 families and a superfamily, as well as other nomenclatural novelties. The taxa first described by Rathbun include important commercial species such as the Atlantic blue crab &quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;, and the tanner crab, &quot;Chionoecetes bairdi&quot;.

<text>Eek-A-Mouse (born Ripton Joseph Hylton, 19 November 1957) is a Jamaican reggae musician. He is one of the earliest artists to be described as a &quot;singjay&quot;. Eek-A-Mouse is well known for pioneering his own style of scatting, differing from the-then toasting deejays in the 80s.

==Biography==
Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Eek-A-Mouse began his music career when he was in college, releasing two roots reggae singles under his own name, which were produced by his mathematics tutor, Mr. Dehaney. These early works were influenced by the music of Pablo Moses. He then went on to work for various sound systems over the next few years and also released a few more singles. He adopted the stage name &quot;Eek-A-Mouse&quot; in 1979, taking the name of a racehorse he always bet on; it was a nickname his friends had used for some time. He began recording for Joe Gibbs in 1979, having a hit straight away with &quot;Once a Virgin&quot;, now showing the influence of Ranking Joe, and this was soon followed with &quot;Wa-Do-Dem&quot; (produced by Douglas Boothe), and &quot;Modelling Queen&quot;, which began an association with Linval Thompson, who produced his debut &quot;Bubble Up Yu Hip&quot; album.

By the end of 1980, he had linked up with producer Henry &quot;Junjo&quot; Lawes, with whom he had big hits in 1981 with the likes of &quot;Virgin Girl&quot; and a recut &quot;Wa-Do-Dem&quot;. In 1981, he was the star of the Reggae Sunsplash Festival, cheering audiences still mourning over the death of reggae icon Bob Marley. His association with Lawes led to a string of successful singles and albums, and in 1982 his hits included &quot;Wild Like a Tiger&quot;, &quot;For Hire and Removal&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember&quot;, and &quot;Ganja Smuggling&quot;. The same year he released his second album, &quot;Wa Do Dem&quot;. The &quot;Operation Eradication&quot; single showed Hylton&#x27;s serious side, the song inspired by the vigilante killing of close friend and fellow DJ Errol Shorter. &quot;Skidip&quot; was released before the year was out.

Further albums followed with 1983 &quot;Mouse and the Man&quot;, produced by Linval Thompson, and 1984 &quot;Mouseketeer&quot;, again produced by Lawes. He also featured on several of the live dancehall albums from the era, including the &quot;Aces International&quot; and &quot;Live at Skateland&quot; collections. In the second half of the decade his popularity began to wane slightly, and he targeted the United States with the &quot;Assassinator&quot; album in 1985 (his first US release), produced by Anthony and Ronald Welch. He also travelled to the United Kingdom to record &quot;The King and I&quot; the same year, the album targeted at the rock crossover audience to which he had begun to appeal.

His 1988 album &quot;Eek-A-Nomics&quot; saw him begin to establish himself with an international audience, spawning a club hit with &quot;The Freak&quot;, and he was signed by Island Records in 1989. He returned to prominence with 1991&#x27;s &quot;U-Neek&quot; album, which continued the rock-oriented style, including a cover version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot;, and from which the hit single &quot;You&#x27;re The One I Need&quot; was taken. He went through a period of relative quietness before returning in 1996 with the &quot;Black Cowboy&quot; album.

He also has a performance in the 1991 gangster movie &quot;New Jack City&quot; playing a drug-dealing Rastafarian named Fat Smitty. That same year, he also had a performance in &quot;Out for Justice&quot; playing a chauffeur of a pimp.

Eek-A-Mouse was a regular performer at Reggae Sunsplash, often teaming up with reggae duo Michigan &amp; Smiley. An album of their 1982 performance was released by Sunsplash Records.

He performed in Jamaica for the first time in eight years in August 2015 at the Marcus Garvey Festival in Ocho Rios.

Apart from his distinctive vocal style, Eek-A-Mouse has been noted for wearing often flashy costumes during his performances. In a 1985 interview, he explained: &quot;Entertaining is not just singing and rapping to audiences. People want to see you in costume and dancing.&quot;

== Collaborations ==
Eek guests on Roger Kellaway&#x27;s 1984 release &quot;Creation&quot;, contributing his voice to the title track. He was also featured on nu metal group P.O.D.&#x27;s album &quot;Satellite&quot;, lending his vocals to the rock-reggae track &quot;Ridiculous.&quot; He can also be heard on OPM&#x27;s album, &quot;ForThemAsses&quot;, on the track &quot;Perfect Day.&quot; Eek-A-Mouse recorded a song with hip-hop recording artist Ditch, called &quot;Smoke it up&quot; (2007, released in 2009), which is featured on Ditch&#x27;s CD &quot;Public Intoxication&quot;. The song by Ditch and Eek-a-Mouse is featured on the Jack Herer documentary as well. Eek was featured with background vocals on the hit single &quot;Khaki Suit&quot;, also featuring Bounty Killer, from the Grammy-award winning album &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; by Damian Marley. Eek was also part of the recording of one of the most important German hip hop albums &quot;Blauer Samt&quot; by Torch (German rapper). He can be heard on the track &quot;Auf der Flucht&quot; (&quot;On the run&quot;).

==Legal issues==
On 16 August 2008, Eek-a-Mouse was arrested on charges of rape and narcotic possession. He fled the United States and an arrest warrant with a million dollar bond was issued. These charges were filed in Dare County, North Carolina after a performance at the Port O&#x27; Call restaurant. He failed to appear at the first hearing and was given a failure to appear charge, with the court issuing an &quot;order to arrest&quot;.
He was discovered to be in the Netherlands in 2010, but was unable to travel due to either an expired visa or the volcanos in Iceland.

On 21 November 2012, Eek-a-Mouse was found in Paraguay without a proper visa and was eventually extradited to the US. He was initially charged with felony rape, felony kidnapping, felony cocaine charges and misdemeanor relating to possession of marijuana. In July 2013 he was released after a plea agreement, having pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; to misdemeanor charges for assault on a female and attempted crime against nature, with his time already spent in jail covering his sentence. He was then deported back to Jamaica.

<doc id="877241" wikidata="Q5363646" url="?curid=877241" title="Shanwick Oceanic Control">
<text>Shanwick is the air traffic control (ATC) name given to the area of international airspace which lies above the northeast part of the Atlantic Ocean.

The Shanwick Oceanic Control Area (OCA) abuts Reykjavík OCA to the north, Gander OCA to the west and Santa Maria OCA to the south. Shanwick also has eastern boundaries with the Scottish, Shannon, London, Brest and Madrid domestic ATC flight information regions.

==History==
Responsibility for the provision of air traffic services within international airspace is delegated to United Nations member states by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). ICAO divides such airspace into flight information regions, parts of which may be deemed controlled airspace and, where appropriate, classified as an Oceanic Control Area.

Prior to 1966, both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland were selected by ICAO to provide control and communications services to air traffic within adjacent areas of the north east Atlantic. The air/ground High Frequency (HF) radio communication station at Ballygirreen, near Shannon, County Clare, Ireland, provided HF communications to the Irish Aviation Authority ATC centre at Shannon. The HF radio communication station at Birdlip, England, provided HF communications to the Civil Aviation Authority (now NATS) ATC centre at Prestwick, Scotland.

The resulting duplication of work between ATC providers resulted in an agreement being reached between the UK and Irish governments, where Birdlip and Ballygirreen would work as a single unit. The Prestwick Centre assumed the control function of the joint area and Ballygirreen ultimately assumed sole responsibility for HF communications. The name Shanwick is a portmanteau of Shannon and Prestwick.

==Operation==
Responsibility for providing an Air Traffic Control Service (Including Flight Information Service and Alerting Service) to aircraft in receipt of a procedural control or ADS-B surveillance service falls to the Prestwick Centre, which also provides CPDLC and ADS-C services for suitably equipped aircraft. Voice radio communications are shared between the CDOs (clearance delivery officers) based at Prestwick Centre and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) Radio Operators from Shannon Aeradio, based in Ballygirreen. Shanwick Control further delegates control of traffic within the NOTA (Northern Oceanic Transition Area) and the SOTA (Shannon Oceanic Transition Area) to Shannon Control, and traffic in the Brest Oceanic Transition Area (BOTA) to Brest Control.

Ballygirreen establishes radio contact with flights within the Shanwick OCA by means of HF radio, using the radiotelephony callsign &quot;Shanwick Radio&quot;. HF can provide global coverage due to its ability to reflect (see refraction) off the ionosphere and can span the globe in a series of skips. VHF coverage, however, is normally limited to line-of-sight range.

&quot;Shanwick Radio&quot; uses over twenty HF channels and two VHF channels. At peak times its communications with aircraft is in excess of 1,600 aircraft during a 24-hour period. Shanwick Radio maintain HF communications with all flights within the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area and are responsible for issuing voice clearances to those flights unable to contact Air Traffic Control Officers at Prestwick Centre directly via CPDLC.

Using the callsign &quot;Shanwick Oceanic&quot;, the Prestwick Centre has two dedicated VHF frequencies specifically for the issue of oceanic clearances by Clearance Delivery Officers, (Radio operator licensed Air Traffic Services Assistants), to westbound flights entering the Shanwick OCA, and also provides an ACARS based system called Oceanic Clearance Link (OCL) for suitably equipped aircraft to obtain such clearances without the need for voice communications.

Using the callsign &quot;Shanwick Control&quot;, Air Traffic Control Officers at Prestwick are able to communicate directly, on a dedicated VHF channel, with pilots in the south east corner of the Shanwick OCA, who are routing via the fixed Tango routes, (T9 and T290).

==Operations transfer==
During October 2009, NATS transferred its Oceanic ATC operations from the former Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre (OACC) into the £300M Prestwick Centre. The Prestwick OACC had been located within the Scottish &amp; Oceanic Area Control Centre (ScOACC) at NATS&#x27; Atlantic House facility, adjacent to the Prestwick Centre. The Prestwick Centre is also home to the Scottish Area Control Centre (including, since January 2010, the former Manchester Area Control Centre).

Oceanic ATC operations at the Prestwick Centre are undertaken using the Nav Canada designed ATC flight data system, Gander Automated Air Traffic System+ (GAATS+). GAATS+ has been in service with NATS since November 2014. (Located close to Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, Canada, is the Nav Canada Gander ATC centre which is responsible for flights in the northwest part of the North Atlantic.) GAATS+ enables controllers to maintain accurate flight data, undertake communications with flights and electronically communicate with adjacent ATC units.

==Upgrades==
During 2005-2006, upgrades to the Shanwick Radio and Shannon Aeradio equipment at Ballygirreen took place and the IAA entered into an agreement with the Flugstoðir (Icelandic ATC, known as ISAVIA) subsidiary Gannet ATS Communications to provide additional HF communication services within the Shanwick OCA via the Gufunes Telecommunications Centre (in Reykjavík, Iceland). In June 2015, the IAA deployed a &quot;Virtual Centre&quot;. With this system, ISAVIA operates VCCS (Voice Communications Control System) equipment at Gufunes. Additionally, an identical IAA also operates VCCS equipment at Ballygirreen. The two VCCS sites can function jointly as a single &quot;virtual centre&quot;, or they can operate independently.

==Long-range radar==
In July 2015, it was revealed the Irish government would purchase a new long-range radar system for the Irish Aviation Authority and the Irish Defence Forces (military) to monitor covert aircraft flying in Irish-controlled airspace, including military aircraft that do not file a flight plan and do not have their transponders switched on. Irish Minister for Defence, Simon Coveney, said the increased capability would provide greater surveillance of airspace over the Atlantic Ocean which the IAA managed.

==Traffic statistics==
During the summer, Shanwick typically handles 1,400 flights per day. Approximately 80% of flights within the North Atlantic region fly through Shanwick airspace.

Approximately 80% of flights within Shanwick airspace communicate directly with Shanwick using ADS-C and CPDLC. These systems permit voice-free communications. However, all aircraft within Shanwick must still maintain HF contact with Shanwick Radio.

<doc id="877249" wikidata="Q2575649" url="?curid=877249" title="Elisabeth Frink">
<text>Dame Elisabeth Jean Frink (14 November 1930 – 18 April 1993) was an English sculptor and printmaker. Her &quot;Times&quot; obituary noted the three essential themes in her work as &quot;the nature of Man; the &#x27;horseness&#x27; of horses; and the divine in human form&quot;.

==Early life==
Elisabeth Frink was born in November 1930 at her paternal grandparents&#x27; home The Grange in Great Thurlow, a village and civil parish in the St Edmundsbury district of Suffolk, England. Her parents were Ralph Cuyler Frink and Jean Elisabeth (née Conway-Gordon). Captain Ralph Cuyler Frink, was a career officer in the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards and among the men of the cavalry regiment evacuated from Dunkirk in the early summer of 1940. She was raised in a Catholic household.

The Second World War, which broke out shortly before Frink&#x27;s ninth birthday, provided context for some of her earliest artistic works. Growing up near a military airfield in Suffolk, she heard bombers returning from their missions and on one occasion was forced to hide under a hedge to avoid the machine gun attack of a German fighter plane. Her early drawings, from the period before she attended arts school in London, have a powerful apocalyptic flavour: themes include wounded birds and falling men. During the course of the war Frink was evacuated with her mother and brother Tim to Exmouth, Devon where she attended Southlands Church of England School. When Southlands School was commandeered for the war effort in 1943 Frink became a full time pupil at The Convent of the Holy Family School.

==Career==
Frink studied at the Guildford School of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts) (1946–1949), under Willi Soukop, and at the Chelsea School of Art (1949–1953). She was part of a postwar group of British sculptors, dubbed the Geometry of Fear school, that included Reg Butler, Bernard Meadows, Kenneth Armitage and Eduardo Paolozzi. Frink&#x27;s subject matter included men, birds, dogs, horses and religious motifs, but very seldom any female forms. &quot;Bird&quot; (1952; London, Tate), one of a number of bird sculptures, and her first successful pieces (also &quot;Three Heads and the Figurative Tradition&quot;) with its alert, menacing stance, characterizes her early work. She created a bookrest in the form of an eagle, for the lectern of the new Coventry Cathedral, as well as a canopy for its Bishop&#x27;s throne.

Although she made many drawings and prints, she is best known for her bronze outdoor sculpture, which has a distinctive cut and worked surface. This is created by her adding plaster to an armature, which she then worked back into with a chisel and surform. This process contradicts the very essence of &quot;modelling form&quot; established in the modelling tradition and defined by Rodin&#x27;s handling of clay.

In the 1960s Frink&#x27;s continuing fascination with the human form was evident in a series of falling figures and winged men. While living in France from 1967 to 1970, she began a series of threatening, monumental male heads, known as the goggled heads. On returning to England, she focused on the male nude, barrel-chested, with mask-like features, attenuated limbs and a pitted surface, for example Running Man (1976; Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museum of Art). Frink&#x27;s sculpture, and her lithographs and etchings created as book illustrations, drew on archetypes expressing masculine strength, struggle and aggression. In 1984 she explained that she &quot;focused on the male because to me he is a subtle combination of sensuality and strength with vulnerability&quot;.

The 1980s held capstones for Frink&#x27;s career. In 1982, a new publishing firm proposed to produce a catalogue raisonné of all of her works to date; and the Royal Academy planned a retrospective of her life&#x27;s work. The date of the retrospective, originally to be held in 1986, was moved forward a year due to space demands at the gallery, causing Frink some headaches due to her busy commissioned work schedule. In 1985 alone, she was committed to two major projects: a set of three figures for a corporate headquarters, one of which was a nearly male nude; and the other, a grouping entitled &quot;Dorset Martyrs&quot; for Dorchester, Dorset.

However, despite the potential for conflict, the retrospective was a success and spurred the art world to hold more exhibitions of Frink&#x27;s worth, with four solo exhibitions and several group ones coming in the following year. Tirelessly, Frink continued to accept commissions and sculpt, as well as serve on advisory committees, meet art students who had expressed an interest in her work, and pursue other public commitments.

Having been elected a full Academician at the Royal Academy in 1979, there were moves to make the 54-year-old sculptor the first female president of the academy, Frink however did not want the post and it went instead to Roger de Grey.

Frink kept up this hectic pace of sculpting and exhibiting until early 1991, when an operation for cancer of the oesophagus caused an enforced break. However, short weeks later Frink was again creating sculptures and preparing for solo exhibitions. In September, she underwent further surgery. Again, Frink did not let this hold her back, proceeding with a planned trip for exhibitions to New Orleans, Louisiana, and New York City. The exhibitions were a success, but Frink&#x27;s health was clearly deteriorating. Despite this, she was working on a colossal statue, &quot;Risen Christ&quot;, for Liverpool Cathedral. This sculpture would prove to be her last; just one week after its installation, Frink died from cancer on 18 April 1993, aged 62, in Blandford Forum, Dorset. Stephen Gardiner, Frink&#x27;s official biographer, argued that this final sculpture was appropriate: &quot;This awesome work, beautiful, clear and commanding, a vivid mirror-image of the artist&#x27;s mind and spirit, created against fearful odds, was a perfect memorial for a remarkable great individual.&quot;

== Exhibitions ==
Frink&#x27;s first solo exhibition was held at St George&#x27;s Gallery, London in 1955. In 1958 she joined the Waddington Galleries, London. Between 1959 and 1972 Frink exhibited with regularity (usually one show every year) at the Waddington Galleries. In the 1960s she was also represented by the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York City. 1971 saw Frink first exhibit in the Royal Academy, London as part of the Summer Exhibition. In the same year, Frink was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. In 1974, Frink began exhibiting with Beaux Arts (Patricia and Reg Singh). Terry Dintenfass became Elisabeth Frink’s American gallerist starting in 1979 and the two women forged a lasting friendship. The Dintenfass Gallery had comprehensive one person shows in 1979, 1983 and 1991. In 1985, a retrospective of Frink&#x27;s work was held at the Royal Academy of Art, London.

==Personal life==
Frink married Michel Jammet in 1955: their son was born in 1958 and the marriage was dissolved in 1963. Between 1964 and 1974 she was married to Edward Pool. Hungarian born Alexander Csaky, whom she married as her third husband in 1974, predeceased her by only a few months. Dame Elisabeth died of cancer on 18 April 1993, aged 62.

==Highlights==
&quot;Warhorse&quot; and &quot;Walking Madonna&quot; may be seen in the garden at Chatsworth House. Other work is at the Jerwood Sculpture Park at Ragley Hall. Uniquely in England, &quot;Desert Quartet&quot; (1990), Frink&#x27;s penultimate sculpture, was listed at Grade II* in 2007, less than 30 years from its creation by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It may be seen opposite Liverpool Gardens in Worthing. Her 1975 bust of John Pope-Hennessy is in the collection of the British Museum.

==Frink School of Figurative Sculpture==
Before Frink died in 1993, she had given master classes at the Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture then headed by sculptor Colin Melbourne ARA in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Rosemary Barnett took over as principal of the Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture, Stoke-on-Trent, briefly before its closure. In 1990 she met Harry Everington there and their shared artistic outlook brought about the Frink School of Figurative Sculpture which opened in 1996 in Longton and closed in 2005 at Tunstall.

Permission from the Frink Estate was given to name a new school after her, because it was to continue the tradition which she represented. The Frink School of Figurative Sculpture opened in 1996, with an emphasis on sculptural form; it attempted to give some balance to the declining figurative training and increased conceptualism in sculpture schools in the UK.

==Studio reconstruction==
In 2019, Frink&#x27;s studio at Woolland in Dorset was reconstructed in a historic tithe barn at Place Farm in Tisbury, Wiltshire by the art gallery Messums Wiltshire for their 2020 exhibition &quot;A Place Apart&quot;. A collection of original plasters were exhibited in the studio alongside tools and objects salvaged from the original studio.

==Cultural reference==
Frink was one of five &#x27;Women of Achievement&#x27; selected for a set of British stamps issued in August 1996. The others were Dorothy Hodgkin (scientist), Margot Fonteyn (ballerina / choreographer), Marea Hartman (sports administrator) and Daphne Du Maurier (writer). Works by Frink are held in the collections of the Jerwood Gallery, National Galleries of Scotland, The Ingram Collection of Modern British Art, The Priseman Seabrook Collection and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Frink was chosen as the subject of the British Art Medal Society medal in 1992. The medal by Avril Vaughan was featured in the Society&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Medal&quot;, no 23 (1993). The medal was cast by the Royal Mint in an edition of 47 medals.

Frink&#x27;s sculptures were featured in the 1963 science fiction film &quot;The Damned&quot;, directed by Joseph Losey. Frink not only lent these but also was on location for their shooting and coached actor Viveca Lindfors on performing the sculptor&#x27;s method of building up plaster, which was then ferociously worked and carved. Frink&#x27;s work also appeared in Losey&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Servant&quot;.

A 1956 bronze statue of Frink, by F. E. McWilliam, stands outside the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry.

<text>Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst (1 November 1743 – 5 November 1807) was a German naturalist and entomologist from Petershagen, Minden-Ravensberg. He served as a chaplain in the Prussian army. His marriage in Berlin, 1770, with Euphrosyne Luise Sophie (1742–1805), daughter of the Prussian &quot;Hofrat&quot; Libert Waldschmidt, seems to have been childless.

He was the joint editor, with Carl Gustav Jablonsky, of &quot;Naturgeschichte der in- und ausländischen Insekten&quot; (1785–1806, 10 volumes), which was one of the first attempts at a complete survey of the order Coleoptera. Herbst&#x27;s &quot;Naturgeschichte der Krabben und Krebse&quot;, released in installments, was the first full survey of crustaceans.

Herbst&#x27;s other works included &quot;Anleitung zur Kenntnis der Insekten&quot; (1784–86, 3 volumes), &quot;Naturgeschichte der Krabben und Krebse&quot; (1782–1804, 3 volumes), &quot;Einleitung zur Kenntnis der Würmer&quot; (1787–88, 2 volumes), and &quot;Natursystem der ungeflügelten Insekten&quot; (Classification of the unwinged insects) (1797–1800, 4 parts).

<text>Ruggles Wright (1793 – August 18, 1863) was a Canadian lumber merchant, the second youngest son of Philemon Wright.

He was born in Woburn, Massachusetts but moved to Canada with his parents while still young. He later joined the family business in the timber trade. Wright also served as justice of the peace and postmaster during the 1820s. In 1829, he built the first timber slide on the Ottawa River to transport logs past the Chaudière Falls, creating Philemon Island. However, by 1840, a competing slide built on the opposite (Ontario) side of the river had won over most of the business. He also took on management of the family cement manufactory and greatly expanded it during the construction of the Rideau Canal.

Wright was married twice: first to Hannah Chamberlain and later to Rosina McDowell. His daughter Hannah, married Joseph Merrill Currier, a lumber baron, in 1868. His son William McKay Wright served in the Canadian House of Commons.

In partnership with John Egan, he operated steamships transporting goods on the Ottawa River.

<text>Huijong (21 June 1181 – 31 August 1237), personal name Wang Yŏng, was the 21st king of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea.

It is said of King Huijong that if he were to have grown old he would have made a great king. When his father ascended to the throne and Huijong became Crown Prince, he rebelled against Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn, the military leader of that time, and his younger brother Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-su. Huijong grew truly hostile towards them after Ch&#x27;ung-su forced the Crown Princess to abdicate so that he could replace her with his daughter. During the rebellion, Huijong masterminded a plan to make Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn kill Ch&#x27;ung-su, but Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn found out about it. Huijong was forced to beg for forgiveness and humble himself before one of his own subjects, which only made him hungrier for revenge.

When King Sinjong fell ill in 1204, he stepped down from the throne to let his son Huijong be king. Huijong, knowing that he had to lull Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn into a false sense of security in order to be able to kill him, promoted him to &quot;Prime Minister of the State.&quot; This title was the one most often given out during the time of military rule to people such as Chŏng Chung-bu, Yi Ŭi-min, and even Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn&#x27;s father posthumously. Huijong also named Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn the &quot;Royal Protector&quot;, the greatest honor of the time, which was usually only given to relatives of the King. With these two titles, Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn had political power nearly equal to that of the King himself. He used it to obliterate three rebellions, one led by his slave, another by Silla partisans, and one by his nephew Pak Chin-jae ().

As Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn became secure in his new position, however, Huijong began to make preparations. Claiming illness, he tricked Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn into coming alone into the palace without his usual host of guards. Once he arrived, Huijong attempted a coup d&#x27;état against him. Unfortunately, this failed and Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn barely escaped with his life. Enraged, he exiled King Huijong to Yeongjongdo. Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn had realized by this time that he held the &#x27;power of the heavens&#x27; in his hand, and could crown and exile whomever he wished whenever he wished. King Gangjong was crowned in Huijong&#x27;s place. Huijong was later allowed to go to Ganghwa Island by Ch&#x27;oe, who exercised moderation and leniency to the dethroned Hujiong, though Huijong was later exiled back to Yeongjongdo by Ch&#x27;oe&#x27;s son Ch&#x27;oe U after he caught wind of Huijong&#x27;s attempts to plot a restoration.

<text>Bamzooki (styled as BAMZOOKi) is a British children&#x27;s television game show for CBBC. Teams engage in knockout tournaments comprising a series of augmented reality contests, utilizing their virtual mobile creatures, known as &quot;Zooks.&quot; The Zooks were created by the contestants using a computer-generated toolkit developed by Gameware Development. The toolkit was free to download from the CBBC website for the public to use.

The original series premiered in March 2004 on the CBBC channel, and was presented by Jake Humphrey. It initially ran until 2006, airing over forty episodes across three seasons. A new thirteen-part revival series, set on a street, titled &quot;Bamzooki: Street Rules”, premiered in November 2009 with new presenters—Barney Harwood and Gemma Hunt—, a revamped toolkit with improved graphics and physics, new contests, new &quot;House Zooks,&quot; a new format, and a &quot;Zook Doctor.&quot;

==History==
=== &quot;Bamzooki: Street Rules&quot; ===
Following the show&#x27;s initial run, a new series entitled &quot;Bamzooki: Street Rules&quot; was broadcast between 2009 and 2010. The premise of &quot;Street Rules&quot; involved the government treating the competition as if it were an illegal combat sport, leading to attempted crackdowns. In each episode, four teams participated, with each team having one Zook.

They took part in a street race at the beginning of each show, and the winning team picked an opponent for the next game, a best of three, one-on-one round. The two losing Zooks took part in another challenge called &quot;Pressure Pusher,&quot; with the loser being destroyed. The final three Zooks competed in a time-trial challenge, with the losing zook being destroyed. The final two competed in a rooftop assault course, with the going to the next stage, along with the three losers.

A total of nine house Zooks competed in the game, including Mimi (who serves as the mascot in this series as well as in the Boulder Dash and Zook chicken games), The Beast, Peachy, Derek, Predator, Centi, Punka, Punkalicious, and Mean Green.

==Technology==
A Zook is an autonomous creature designed by users and contestants on the gameshow. Created using 3D primitives, Zooks move autonomously based on IK points assigned by the designer.

Inspired by nature, contestants design Zooks to compete in various competitions. The toolkit for designing Zooks is available for download on the show&#x27;s website. Recently, two new features have been added to the Zook-Kit, allowing users to simulate TV contests and replay their Zooks&#x27; performances from multiple angles.

Gameware&#x27;s Creature Labs team uses artificial life programming techniques to provide the Zooks&#x27; autonomous movement and behavior. This is integrated with the BBC&#x27;s virtual studio system for real-time visualizations in a studio setting.

The Bamzooki Zook Kit enables users to build virtual creatures, called Zooks, and test them in a real-time, physically simulated environment. Kids used this software to build Zooks and submitted them to the BBC. Selected teams were invited to the studio to enter their Zooks in various contests. The new series &quot;Bamzooki: Street Rules,&quot; which aired in November 2009, features fully interactive contests where participants direct their Zooks by shouting instructions, as well as contests set on the streets and rooftops. Thirty-six teams were selected for the championships, which included nine heats, a semi-final, and a final.

The software and manual were freely available from the BBC website. Although designed to be easy enough for children to use, it is highly flexible and versatile. Zooks are constructed from basic components that users shape and assemble. Users are not restricted to particular body designs or topologies, although the control system uses a standard Braitenberg architecture.

The BBC&#x27;s Virtual Studio technology was used to enable real-time composition of the 3D-rendered graphics with live camera feeds. Each studio camera has a dedicated render PC to render the virtual scene from that camera&#x27;s perspective. To know what a studio camera&#x27;s perspective is, each camera is fitted with a second &quot;Free-D&quot; camera that points towards the ceiling. On the ceiling are reflective, circular bar codes. The 3-D camera data is fed to a computer system that identifies the targets on the ceiling and calculates the camera&#x27;s position and orientation 50 times a second. Series 4 adopted Vinten tracking peds instead of FREE-D as an alternative approach.

The contest runs in real time on a networked PC. All the clients receive contest scene information and render their scenes from their studio camera&#x27;s point of view. A bank of chroma key boxes then composites the virtual and the live feed together to provide a real-time composite. This video stream can be sent to the studio camera monitors so that camera operators can view the composite and hence follow the action in real time.

The toolkit (a modified version of the Bonsai artificial life program) has at times been utilized by adults for their own purposes, including research.

==Community==

A popular aim in Bamzooki was to get a Zook into the galleries or leagues, as they are often the most viewed and downloaded Zooks. To get into the leagues, you have to make a maxed-out zook on a specific event; these events are sprint, block push, hurdles, high jump, and lap. Every month, the CBBC Bamzooki site releases a new gallery based on a topic like &quot;space zooks&quot; or &quot;spooky zooks.&quot; For every gallery, there are 16 spaces, and the Zook moderators choose the best-looking zooks to take those places. A toolkit was praised for its educational value, teaching basic principles of physics, animation, and programming. Although primarily aimed at children, the software was sophisticated enough to be used by adults for research purposes.

A relatively new league is the Ultimate Zook Leaderboard, where scores from all the trials are aggregated into one score, which zooks are then compared on.

<text>Jakub Šimon Jan Ryba (surname also Poisson, Peace, Ryballandini, Rybaville; 26 October 1765 – 8 April 1815) was a Czech teacher and composer of classical music. His most famous work is the &quot;Czech Christmas Mass &quot;Hey, Master!&quot;&quot; (&quot;Česká mše vánoční &quot;Hej mistře!&quot;&quot;).

Ryba was born in Přeštice near Plzeň. His father was a schoolteacher, which was a very poorly paid occupation at the time. In 1780 Ryba went to Prague, where he studied at the Piarist gymnasium. His teacher Cassianus Hanel taught him music. Ryba was a very good student and he soon started to compose. He dreamt of being a famous composer. In 1784 his father ordered him to work as a teacher in Nepomuk. Ryba reluctantly obeyed, but he was soon fired. After wandering for a few months, he received a message that his mother had died. After a long illness, he moved to Mníšek pod Brdy. Being popular among local inhabitants for performing music, he was quite happy there, but after some hesitation he accepted a schoolteacher position in Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.

The school prospered under his supervision, but he had constant conflicts with the local pastor and council. His frequent requests for funds for repairs of the school building were usually rejected. In 1796, he wrote his most famous work, &quot;Czech Christmas Mass &quot;Hey, Master!&quot;&quot; (named by him as &quot;Missa solemnis Festis Nativitatis D. J. Ch. accommodata in linguam bohemicum musicam&quot;), also as a consequence of a reconciliation with the local pastor. This work continues to be frequently performed at Christmas time in Bohemia.

An insufferable lack of money, the hostility of his superiors and total exhaustion led him to commit suicide at Voltuš near Rožmitál pod Třemšínem. On April 8, 1815, Ryba attended morning mass. Later, he was found in a dense forest with his throat cut with a razor. He had &quot;Essay on Peace of Soul&quot; by Seneca the Younger, his favourite author, with him. He was buried at a plague cemetery near Rožmitál pod Tremšínem.

His works mainly include many pastorellas and masses, but few compositions beyond the &quot;Czech Christmas Mass&quot; are performed regularly today.

<doc id="877295" wikidata="Q1758389" url="?curid=877295" title="Mixed reality">
<text>Mixed reality (MR) is a term used to describe the merging of a real-world environment and a computer-generated one. Physical and virtual objects may co-exist in mixed reality environments and interact in real time.

Mixed reality that incorporates haptics has sometimes been referred to as visuo-haptic mixed reality.

In a physics context, the term &quot;interreality system&quot; refers to a virtual reality system coupled with its real-world counterpart. A 2007 paper describes an interreality system comprising a real physical pendulum coupled to a pendulum that only exists in virtual reality. This system has two stable states of motion: a &quot;dual reality&quot; state in which the motion of the two pendula are uncorrelated, and a &quot;mixed reality&quot; state in which the pendula exhibit stable phase-locked motion, which is highly correlated. The use of the terms &quot;mixed reality&quot; and &quot;interreality&quot; is clearly defined in the context of physics and may be slightly different in other fields, however, it is generally seen as, &quot;bridging the physical and virtual world&quot;.

== Applications ==
Mixed reality has been used in applications across fields including design, education, entertainment, military training, healthcare, product content management, and human-in-the-loop operation of robots.

=== Education ===
Simulation-based learning includes VR and AR based training and interactive, experiential learning. There are many potential use cases for mixed reality in both educational settings and professional training settings. In education, AR has been used to simulate historical battles, providing an unparalleled immersive experience for students and potentially enhanced learning experiences. In addition, AR has shown effectiveness in university education for health science and medical students within disciplines that benefit from 3D representations of models, such as physiology and anatomy.

=== Entertainment ===
From television shows to game consoles, mixed reality has many applications in the field of entertainment.

The 2004 British game show &quot;Bamzooki&quot; called upon child contestants to create virtual &quot;Zooks&quot; and watch them compete in a variety of challenges. The show used mixed reality to bring the Zooks to life. The television show ran for four seasons, ending in 2010.

The 2003 game show &quot;FightBox&quot; also called upon contestants to create competitive characters and used mixed reality to allow them to interact. Unlike &quot;Bamzoomi&quot;″s generally non-violent challenges, the goal of &quot;FightBox&quot; was for new contestants to create the strongest fighter to win the competition.

In 2009, researchers presented to the International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) their social product called &quot;BlogWall&quot;, which consisted of a projected screen on a wall. Users could post short text clips or images on the wall and play simple games such as &quot;Pong&quot;. The BlogWall also featured a poetry mode where it would rearrange the messages it received to form a poem and a polling mode where users could ask others to answer their polls.

&quot;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&quot; is a mixed reality racing game for the Nintendo Switch that was released in October 2020.[16a-New] The game allows players to use their home as a race track Within the first week of release, 73,918 copies were sold in Japan, making it the country&#x27;s best selling game of the week.

Other research has examined the potential for mixed reality to be applied to theatre, film, and theme parks.

=== Military training ===
The first fully immersive mixed reality system was the Virtual Fixtures platform, which was developed in 1992 by Louis Rosenberg at the Armstrong Laboratories of the United States Air Force. It enabled human users to control robots in real-world environments that included real physical objects and 3D virtual overlays (&quot;fixtures&quot;) that were added enhance human performance of manipulation tasks. Published studies showed that by introducing virtual objects into the real world, significant performance increases could be achieved by human operators.

Combat reality can be simulated and represented using complex, layered data and visual aides, most of which are head-mounted displays (HMD), which encompass any display technology that can be worn on the user&#x27;s head. Military training solutions are often built on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies, such as Improbable&#x27;s synthetic environment platform, Virtual Battlespace 3 and VirTra, with the latter two platforms used by the United States Army. , VirTra is being used by both civilian and military law enforcement to train personnel in a variety of scenarios, including active shooter, domestic violence, and military traffic stops. Mixed reality technologies have been used by the United States Army Research Laboratory to study how this stress affects decision-making. With mixed reality, researchers may safely study military personnel in scenarios where soldiers would not likely survive.

In 2017, the U.S. Army was developing the Synthetic Training Environment (STE), a collection of technologies for training purposes that was expected to include mixed reality. , STE was still in development without a projected completion date. Some recorded goals of STE included enhancing realism and increasing simulation training capabilities and STE availability to other systems.

It was claimed that mixed-reality environments like STE could reduce training costs, such as reducing the amount of ammunition expended during training. In 2018, it was reported that STE would include representation of any part of the world&#x27;s terrain for training purposes. STE would offer a variety of training opportunities for squad brigade and combat teams, including Stryker, armory, and infantry teams.

=== Blended spaces ===
A blended space is a space in which a physical environment and a virtual environment are deliberately integrated in a close knit way. The aim of blended space design is to provide people with the experience of feeling a sense of presence in the blended space, acting directly on the content of the blended space. Examples of blended spaces include augmented reality devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens and games such as &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; in addition to many smartphone tourism apps, smart meeting rooms and applications such as bus tracker systems.

The idea of blending comes from the ideas of conceptual integration, or conceptual blending introduced by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner.

Manuel Imaz and David Benyon introduced blending theory to look at concepts in software engineering and human-computer interaction.

The simplest implementation of a blended space requires two features. The first required feature is input. The input can range from tactile, to changes in the environment. The next required feature is notifications received from the digital spaces. The correspondences between the physical and digital space have to be abstracted and exploited by the design of the blended space. Seamless integration of both the spaces is rare. Blended spaces need anchoring points or technologies to link the spaces.

A well designed blended space advertises and conveys the digital content in a subtle and unobtrusive way. Presence can be measured using physiological, behavioral, and subjective measures derived from the space.
There are two main components to any space. They are:
#Objects – The actual distinct objects which make up the medium/space. The objects thus effectively describe the space. 
#Agents – Correspondents/users inside the space who interact with it through the objects.

For presence in a blended space, there must be a physical space and a digital space. In the context of blended space, the higher the communication between the physical and digital spaces, the richer the experience. This communication happens through the medium of correspondents which relay the state and nature of objects.For the purpose of looking at blended spaces, the nature and characteristics of any space can be represented by these factors:# Ontology – Different types of objects present in the space the total number of objects and the relationships between objects and the space.
# Topology – The way objects are placed and positioned.
# Volatility – Frequency with which the objects change.
# Agency – Medium of communication between the objects, and between the objects and users. Agency also encompasses the users inside the space.

Physical space – Physical spaces are spaces which afford spatial interaction. This kind of spatial interaction greatly impacts the user&#x27;s cognitive model. Digital space – Digital space (also called the information space) consists of all the information content. This content can be in any form.

=== Remote working ===
Mixed reality allows a global workforce of remote teams to work together and tackle an organization&#x27;s business challenges. No matter where they are physically located, an employee can wear a headset and noise-canceling headphones and enter a collaborative, immersive virtual environment. As these applications can accurately translate in real time, language barriers become irrelevant. This process also increases flexibility. While many employers still use inflexible models of fixed working time and location, there is evidence that employees are more productive if they have greater autonomy over where, when, and how they work. Some employees prefer loud work environments, while others need silence. Some work best in the morning; others work best at night. Employees also benefit from autonomy in how they work because of different ways of processing information. The classic model for learning styles differentiates between visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners.

Machine maintenance can also be executed with the help of mixed reality. Larger companies with multiple manufacturing locations and a lot of machinery can use mixed reality to educate and instruct their employees. The machines need regular checkups and have to be adjusted every now and then. These adjustments are mostly done by humans, so employees need to be informed about needed adjustments. By using mixed reality, employees from multiple locations can wear headsets and receive live instructions about the changes. Instructors can operate the representation that every employee sees, and can glide through the production area, zooming in to technical details and explaining every change needed. Employees completing a five-minute training session with such a mixed-reality program have been shown to attain the same learning results as reading a 50-page training manual. An extension to this environment is the incorporation of live data from operating machinery into the virtual collaborative space and then associated with three dimensional virtual models of the equipment. This enables training and execution of maintenance, operational and safety work processes, which would otherwise be difficult in a live setting, while making use of expertise, no matter their physical location.

=== Functional mockup ===
Mixed reality can be used to build mockups that combine physical and digital elements. With the use of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), mockups can interact with the physical world to gain control of more realistic sensory experiences like object permanence, which would normally be infeasible or extremely difficult to track and analyze without the use of both digital and physical aides.

=== Healthcare ===
Smartglasses can be incorporated into the operating room to aide in surgical procedures; possibly displaying patient data conveniently while overlaying precise visual guides for the surgeon. Mixed reality headsets like the Microsoft HoloLens have been theorized to allow for efficient sharing of information between doctors, in addition to providing a platform for enhanced training. This can, in some situations (i.e. patient infected with contagious disease), improve doctor safety and reduce PPE use. While mixed reality has lots of potential for enhancing healthcare, it does have some drawbacks too. The technology may never fully integrate into scenarios when a patient is present, as there are ethical concerns surrounding the doctor not being able to see the patient. Mixed reality is also useful for healthcare education. For example, according to a 2022 report from the World Economic Forum, 85% of first-year medical students at Case Western Reserve University reported that mixed reality for teaching anatomy was &quot;equivalent&quot; or &quot;better&quot; than the in-person class.

=== Product content management ===
Product content management before the advent of mixed reality consisted largely of brochures and little customer-product engagement outside of this 2-dimensional realm. With mixed reality technology improvements, new forms of interactive product content management has emerged. Most notably, 3-dimensional digital renderings of normally 2-dimensional products have increased reachability and effectiveness of consumer-product interaction.

=== Human-in-the-loop operation of robots ===
Recent advances in mixed-reality technologies have renewed interest in alternative modes of communication for human-robot interaction. Human operators wearing mixed reality glasses such as HoloLens can interact with (control and monitor) e.g. robots and lifting machines on site in a digital factory setup. This use case typically requires real-time data communication between a mixed reality interface with the machine / process / system, which could be enabled by incorporating digital twin technology.

=== Business firms ===
Mixed reality allows sellers to show the customers how a certain commodity will suit their demands. A seller may demonstrate how a certain product will fit into the homes of the buyer. The buyer with the assistance of the VR can virtually pick the item, spin around and place to their desired points. This improves the buyer&#x27;s confidence of making a purchase and reduces the number of returns.

Architectural firms can allow customers to virtually visit their desired homes.

== Display technologies and products ==
While mixed reality refers to the intertwining of the virtual world and the physical world at a high level, there are a variety of digital mediums used to accomplish a mixed reality environment. They may range from handheld devices to entire rooms, each having practical uses in different disciplines.

=== Cave automatic virtual environment ===
The cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE) is an environment, typically a small room located in a larger outer room, in which a user is surrounded by projected displays around them, above them, and below them. 3D glasses and surround sound complement the projections to provide the user with a sense of perspective that aims to simulate the physical world. Since being developed, CAVE systems have been adopted by engineers developing and testing prototype products. They allow product designers to test their prototypes before expending resources to produce a physical prototype, while also opening doors for &quot;hands-on&quot; testing on non-tangible objects such as microscopic environments or entire factory floors. After developing the CAVE, the same researchers eventually released the CAVE2, which builds off of the original CAVE&#x27;s shortcomings. The original projections were substituted for 37 megapixel 3D LCD panels, network cables integrate the CAVE2 with the internet, and a more precise camera system allows the environment to shift as the user moves throughout it.

=== Head-up display ===
Head-up display (HUD) is a display that projects imagery directly in front of a viewer without heavily obfuscating their environment. A standard HUD is composed of three elements: a projector, which is responsible for overlaying the graphics of the HUD, the combiner, which is the surface the graphics are projected onto, and the computer, which integrates the two other components and computes any real-time calculations or adjustments. Prototype HUDs were first used in military applications to aid fighter pilots in combat, but eventually evolved to aid in all aspects of flight – not just combat. HUDs were then standardized across commercial aviation as well, eventually creeping into the automotive industry. One of the first applications of HUD in automotive transport came with Pioneer&#x27;s Heads-up system, which replaces the driver-side sun visor with a display that projects navigation instructions onto the road in front of the driver. Major manufacturers such as General Motors, Toyota, Audi, and BMW have since included some form of head-up display in certain models.

=== Head-mounted display ===
A head-mounted display (HMD), worn over the entire head or worn in front of the eyes, is a device that uses one or two optics to project an image directly in front of the user&#x27;s eyes. Its applications range across medicine, entertainment, aviation, and engineering, providing a layer of visual immersion that traditional displays cannot achieve. Head-mounted displays are most popular with consumers in the entertainment market, with major tech companies developing HMDs to complement their existing products. However, these head-mounted displays are virtual reality displays and do not integrate the physical world. Popular augmented reality HMDs, however, are more favorable in enterprise environments. Microsoft&#x27;s HoloLens is an augmented reality HMD that has applications in medicine, giving doctors more profound real-time insight, as well as engineering, overlaying important information on top of the physical world. Another notable augmented reality HMD has been developed by Magic Leap, a startup developing a similar product with applications in both the private sector and the consumer market.

=== Mobile devices ===

Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, have continued to increase in computing power and portability. Many modern mobile devices come equipped with toolkits for developing augmented reality applications. These applications allow developers to overlay computer graphics over videos of the physical world. The first augmented reality mobile game with widespread success was Pokémon GO, which released in 2016 and accumulated 800 million downloads. While entertainment applications utilizing AR have proven successful, productivity and utility apps have also begun integrating AR features. Google has released updates to their Google Maps application that includes AR navigation directions overlaid onto the streets in front of the user, as well as expanding their translate app to overlay translated text onto physical writing in over 20 foreign languages. Mobile devices are unique display technologies due to the fact that they are commonly equipped at all times.

<doc id="877305" wikidata="Q241341" url="?curid=877305" title="Ilona Elek">
<text>Ilona Elek, known also as Ilona Elek-Schacherer (née “Elek&quot;; 17 May 1907 – 24 July 1988) was a Hungarian Olympic fencer. Elek won more international fencing titles than any other woman.

==Early and personal life==
Elek was born on 17 May 1907, in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary to a Hungarian-Jewish father born Eisler who 1939 converted to lutheranism and a Roman-Catholic mother. She had seven siblings, including two-time Olympic fencer Margit Elek, and her mother died when she was 11 years old. She graduated from a music school. When Hungary entered World War II on the side of Nazi Germany, Hungarian Jews were forbidden from entering fencing competitions, and so Elek and her sister, who was also half-Jewish, were unable to compete until after the war ended.

==Fencing career==

Elek competed for Hungary in three Olympiads, winning three medals. She is considered to be one of the greatest female fencers in the history of the sport.

===Hungarian National Championships===
Elek won the Hungarian foil championship in 1946–47, 1949–50, and 1952.

===World Championships===
Elek won the gold medal in women&#x27;s foil at the World Championships in 1934, 1935, and 1951. She won silver in 1937 and 1954, and bronze in 1955.

===Olympics===
Elek was the first woman to win two Olympic gold medals in the individual foil competition.

Elek&#x27;s first Olympic competition was at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, at the age of 29. She won the gold medal in the foil event, the first Hungarian woman to win a gold medal at the Olympics. In the process, Elek, who was Jewish, defeated a German with a Jewish father, Helene Mayer. The bronze medal went to Ellen Preis, an Austrian Jew.

The Games were cancelled in 1940 and 1944. When the Games resumed after World War II, at age 41 she repeated her performance as Olympic champion by winning a gold medal in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England. Ellen Preis again won the bronze medal.

Elek won the silver medal at the 1952 Helsinki Games. After winning her first five matches in the final pool, she was in contention for the gold medal, but she lost to American Maxine Mitchell, and Italian Irene Camber, who won the gold.

===Awards===
She was later awarded the Robert Feyerick Cup and the Olympic Order.

==International Fencing Federation==
In 1983, she was the International Fencing Federation honorary President.

==Later years and death==
Elek later was a director of a trade company. She died in Budapest at the age of 81.

<text>Playbill is an American monthly magazine for theatergoers. Although there is a subscription issue available for home delivery, most copies of &quot;Playbill&quot; are printed for particular productions and distributed at the door as the show&#x27;s program.

&quot;Playbill&quot; was first printed in 1884 for a single theater on 21st Street in New York City. The magazine is now used at nearly every Broadway theatre as well as many Off-Broadway productions. Outside New York City, &quot;Playbill&quot; is used at theaters throughout the United States. its circulation was 4,073,680.

==History==
What is known today as &quot;Playbill&quot; started in 1884, when Frank Vance Strauss founded the New York Theatre Program Corporation specializing in printing theater programs. Strauss reimagined the concept of a theater program, making advertisements a standard feature and thus transforming what was then a leaflet into a fully designed magazine. The new format proved popular with theatergoers, who started to collect playbills as souvenirs; however, the name &quot;(The)&quot; &quot;Playbill&quot; did not appear until the 1930s while earlier programs published by the company simply bore the name of the venue.

In 1918, Frank Vance Strauss sold the company to his nephew, Richard M. Huber. From 1918 onward, the company started printing playbills for all of Broadway and, by 1924, was printing 16,000,000 programs for over 60 theaters. The 1920s also saw attempts to introduce consistency in the design with the covers of the magazines featuring artwork representing the theater, which would stay the same from show to show. In 1934–35, the name &quot;The Playbill&quot; made its first appearance on the cover although there was still no standard logo in that period. The design underwent a series of transformations with show titles occasionally switching places with &quot;The Playbill&quot; logo in various places on the cover until the magazine&#x27;s logo found its permanent place at the top of the front cover and the publication as it is known today became &quot;Playbill&quot; in 1957, under then-owner Gilman Kraft.

==Format==

Each issue features articles focusing on actors, new plays, musicals, and special attractions. This &quot;wraparound&quot; section is the same for all &quot;Playbill&quot;s at all venues each month. Within this wraparound, the &quot;Playbill&quot; contains listings, photos, and biographies of the cast; biographies of authors, composers, and production staff; a list of scenes, as songs and their performers (for musicals); and a brief description of the setting for the particular show. It also lists the number of intermissions and &quot;At This Theatre&quot;, a column with historical information on the theater housing the production. The &quot;Playbill&quot; distributed on opening night of a Broadway show is stamped with a seal on the cover and the date appears on the title page within the magazine. This is, however, not the case for every opening night playbill: there are many in circulation that do not feature the date.

In lieu of the cast and show information, the subscription edition of &quot;Playbill&quot; contains listings of Broadway and Off-Broadway productions and news from London productions and North American touring companies.

The &quot;Playbill&quot; banner is yellow with black writing. Each June since 2014, the yellow banner has been replaced with a rainbow banner for LGBT Pride Month.

The Playbill banner has changed the yellow to another color on rare occasions in its history:
* October 2008 – green for the fifth anniversary of &quot;Wicked&quot; 
* October 2011 – royal blue for the tenth anniversary of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; 
* October 2013 – green for the tenth anniversary of &quot;Wicked&quot;
* April 2018 – white and red for the fifth anniversary of &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;
* November 2021 – black for the 25th anniversary of &quot;Chicago&quot;

==Other media==

&quot;Playbill&quot; launched Playbill Online in January 1994. The free website offers news about the theater industry, focusing on New York shows but including regional theater, touring, and international stage happenings. It is read by show fans and theater practitioners, and is updated regularly. It also offers discounts on tickets and dining for its members.

In 2000, &quot;Playbill&quot; added www.playbillstore.com, an online shopping store offering official &quot;Playbill&quot; merchandise and merchandise from most current Broadway and touring productions.

In 2006, &quot;Playbill&quot; released its first records on Playbill Records, an imprint of SonyBMG. Releases included Brian Stokes Mitchell&#x27;s eponymous solo album and two compilations of show tunes entitled &quot;Scene Stealers, The Men&quot; and &quot;Scene Stealers, The Women.&quot;

&quot;Playbill Radio&quot;, a 24-hour Broadway-themed internet radio station featuring news, podcasts, and a musical library of over 20,000 titles, premiered in 2007.
In 2011, &quot;Playbill&quot; launched Playbill Vault, a comprehensive online database of Broadway history. Playbill Vault provides records of Broadway productions from 1930 to the present. Information on the website includes original and current casts, actor head shots, production credits, Playbill cover images, scanned Playbill Who&#x27;s Who pages, production photos, and videos.

In 2012, &quot;Playbill&quot; launched Playbill Memory Bank, a website that allowed theater-goers to track their memories of their theater attendances by entering dates they attended a show, along with information like ticket scans. The site provided information about cast members, including which performer had each particular role, for roles that may have had several replacements over the life of the show. Playbill Memory Bank shut down December 31, 2016.
&quot;Playbill&quot; launched its first app, called Playbill Passport, on January 4, 2016.

In 2021, &quot;Playbill&quot; added a &quot;post-the-pay&quot; rule to their job site after a campaign by On Our Team and Costume Professionals for Wage Equity called for an increased pay transparency and equity in the theater industry.

==Competition with &quot;Stagebill&quot;==
For decades, &quot;Playbill&quot; concentrated on Broadway and Off-Broadway theaters, while &quot;Stagebill&quot; focused on concerts, opera, and dance in venues such as Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. However, by the late 1990s, &quot;Playbill&quot; was highly profitable; &quot;Stagebill&quot; was not, losing millions of dollars annually by 1998. To increase revenue, &quot;Stagebill&quot; entered &quot;Playbill&quot;″s turf. The truce was first breached in 1995, when The Public Theater quietly defected to &quot;Stagebill,&quot; and more noisily in 1997, when Disney contracted &quot;Stagebill&quot; for its musical &quot;The Lion King&quot; at its newly reopened New Amsterdam Theatre. The main point of contention in the latter case was control over advertising content: &quot;Playbill&quot; is distributed free to theaters, relying on advertising revenue that is completely under its authority, whereas Disney, per company policy, required a program without cigarette or liquor ads.

In response to &quot;Stagebill&#x27;s&quot; upstart incursion, &quot;Playbill&quot; began to produce &quot;Showbill&quot;, a sister publication that conformed to Disney&#x27;s advertising requirements for all publications distributed in its properties. Now with an alternative, Disney switched from &quot;Stagebill&quot; to &quot;Showbill&quot; for &quot;The Lion King&quot; late in its run at the New Amsterdam. (When the musical moved to the Minskoff Theatre, which Disney does not own, it was obligated to use &quot;Playbill&quot;, as are Disney productions at other theaters.) The Ford Center for the Performing Arts also commissioned &quot;Showbill&quot; for its inaugural production of &quot;Ragtime&quot;, presumably to exclude other automakers&#x27; ads. In a different circumstance, the producers of the Broadway revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; wished to maintain the atmosphere of a sleazy nightclub at its Studio 54 venue, and insisted on handing out &quot;Playbill&quot;s &quot;after&quot; the performance (instead of before). &quot;Playbill,&quot; sensing missed exposure for its advertisers, offered the show&#x27;s producers &quot;Showbill&quot; instead.

Additionally, &quot;Playbill&quot; responded further by producing publications for classic arts venues, aggressively courting many venues that were once &quot;Stagebill&quot; clients. In the spring of 2002, &quot;Playbill&quot; signed a contract with Carnegie Hall; this milestone was bookended by the earlier acquisition of the valuable Metropolitan Opera program and the ensuing contract with the New York Philharmonic—both tenants of &quot;Stagebill&#x27;s&quot; erstwhile stronghold Lincoln Center. With the acquisition of the programs for performing arts venues, &quot;Playbill&quot; broke from its typical format and began publishing completely customized programs in the vein of &quot;Stagebill.&quot; This, coupled with continuing fiscal troubles, signaled the end of &quot;Stagebill&quot; as a publishing entity; later that year, &quot;Stagebill&quot; became insolvent after five years of head-to-head competition with &quot;Playbill,&quot; which acquired the &quot;Stagebill&quot; trademark.

<text> is the national anthem of the United Arab Emirates. It was officially accepted as the national anthem of the UAE after the formation of the country in 1971.

==History and use==
It is not clear whether it was the Egyptian composer Saad Abdel Wahab or his uncle, Egyptian composer Alhan Ahammed, who created the melody for the anthem in 1971. The anthem did not have lyrics until 1986, which were written by Arif Al Sheikh.

<text>In probability theory, independent increments are a property of stochastic processes and random measures. Most of the time, a process or random measure has independent increments by definition, which underlines their importance. Some of the stochastic processes that by definition possess independent increments are the Wiener process, all Lévy processes, all additive process
and the Poisson point process.

== Definition for stochastic processes ==
Let formula_1 be a stochastic process. In most cases, formula_2 or formula_3. Then the stochastic process has independent increments if and only if for every formula_4 and any choice formula_5 with
:formula_6

the random variables
:formula_7

are stochastically independent.

== Definition for random measures ==
A random measure formula_8 has got independent increments if and only if the random variables formula_9 are stochastically independent for every selection of pairwise disjoint measurable sets formula_10 and every formula_4. 

== Independent S-increments ==
Let formula_8 be a random measure on formula_13 and define for every bounded measurable set formula_14 the random measure formula_15 on formula_16 as
:formula_17

Then formula_8 is called a random measure with independent S-increments, if for all bounded sets formula_19 and all formula_20 the random measures formula_21 are independent.

== Application ==
Independent increments are a basic property of many stochastic processes and are often incorporated in their definition. The notion of independent increments and independent S-increments of random measures plays an important role in the characterization of Poisson point process and infinite divisibility.

<doc id="877316" wikidata="Q1424706" url="?curid=877316" title="Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome">
<text>Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), also known as opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA), is a rare neurological disorder of unknown cause which appears to be the result of an autoimmune process involving the nervous system. It is an extremely rare condition, affecting as few as 1 in 10,000,000 people per year. It affects 2 to 3% of children with neuroblastoma and has been reported to occur with celiac disease and diseases of neurologic and autonomic dysfunction.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include:
* opsoclonus (rapid, involuntary, multivectorial (horizontal and vertical), unpredictable, conjugate fast eye movements without intersaccadic [quick rotation of the eyes] intervals)
* myoclonus (brief, involuntary twitching of a muscle or a group of muscles)
* cerebellar ataxia, both truncal and appendicular
* aphasia (a language disorder in which there is an impairment of speech and of comprehension of speech, caused by brain damage)
* mutism (a language disorder in which a person does not speak despite evidence of speech ability in the past, often part of a larger neurological or psychiatric disorder)
* lethargy
* irritability or malaise
* drooling
* strabismus (a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other)
* vomiting
* sleep disturbances
* emotional disturbances (including fits of rage)
About half of all OMS cases occur in association with neuroblastoma (a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system usually occurring in infants and children).

=== Disease course and clinical subtypes ===
In most cases, OMS starts with an acute flare-up of physical symptoms within days or weeks, but some less obvious symptoms such as irritability and malaise may begin weeks or months earlier.

==Cause==
In children, most cases are associated with neuroblastoma and most of the others are suspected to be associated with a low-grade neuroblastoma that spontaneously regressed before detection. In adults, most cases are associated with breast carcinoma or small-cell lung carcinoma. It is one of the few paraneoplastic (meaning &#x27;indirectly caused by cancer&#x27;) syndromes that occurs in both children and adults, although the mechanism of immune dysfunction underlying the adult syndrome is probably quite different.

It is hypothesized that a viral infection (perhaps St. Louis encephalitis, Chikungunya, Epstein-Barr, Coxsackie B, enterovirus, or just a flu) causes the remaining cases, though a direct connection has not been proven. Rare cases of Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome associated with Lyme disease have also been reported.

OMS is not generally considered an infectious disease. OMS is not passed on genetically.

==Diagnosis==
Because OMS is so rare and occurs at an average age of 19 months (6 to 36 months), a diagnosis can be slow. Some cases have been diagnosed as having been caused by a virus. After a diagnosis of OMS is made, an associated neuroblastoma is discovered in half of cases, with median delay of 3 months.

The interictal EEG pattern is usually normal.

==Treatment==

There is no known definitive cure for OMS. However, several drugs have proven to be effective in their treatment.

Some of medication used to treat the symptoms are:
* ACTH has shown improvements in symptoms but can result in an incomplete recovery with residual deficits.
* Corticosteroids (such as &quot;prednisone&quot; or &quot;methylprednisolone&quot;) used at high dosages (500 mg - 2 g per day intravenously for a course of 3 to 5 days) can accelerate regression of symptoms. Subsequent very gradual tapering with pills generally follows. Most patients require high doses for months to years before tapering.
* Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIg) are often used with varying results.
* Several other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, may be helpful in some cases.
* Chemotherapy for neuroblastoma may be effective, although data is contradictory and unconvincing at this point in time.
* Rituximab has been used with encouraging results.
* Other medications are used to treat symptoms without influencing the nature of the disease (symptomatic treatment):
** Trazodone can be useful against irritability and sleep problems
* Additional treatment options include plasmapheresis for severe, steroid-unresponsive relapses.
The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) recommends FLAIR therapy consisting of a three-agent protocol involving front-loaded high-dose ACTH, IVIg, and rituximab that was developed by the National Pediatric Myoclonus Center, and has the best-documented outcomes. Almost all patients (80-90%) show improvement with this treatment and the relapse rate appears to be about 20%.

A more detailed summary of current treatment options can be found at Treatment Options

The following medications should probably be avoided:
* Midazolam - Can cause irritability.
* Melatonin - Is known to stimulate the immune system.
* Also, see for more details

==Prognosis==
Currently, there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available to predict prognosis or therapeutic response.

Tumors in children who develop OMS tend to be more mature, showing favorable histology and absence of n-myc oncogene amplification than similar tumors in children without symptoms of OMS. Involvement of local lymph nodes is common, but these children rarely have distant metastases and their prognosis, in terms of direct morbidity and mortality effects from the tumor, is excellent. The three-year survival rate for children with non-metastatic neuroblastoma and OMS was 100% according to Children&#x27;s Cancer Group data (gathered from 675 patients diagnosed between 1980 and 1994); three-year survival in comparable patients with OMS was 77%. Although the symptoms of OMS are typically steroid-responsive and recovery from acute symptoms of OMS can be quite good, children often experience lifelong neurologic sequelae that impair motor, cognitive, language, and behavioral development.

Most children will experience a relapsing form of OMS, though a minority will have a monophasic course and may be more likely to recover without residual deficits. Viral infection may play a role in the reactivation of disease in some patients who had previously experienced remission, possibly by expanding the memory B cell population. Studies have generally asserted that 70-80% of children with OMS will have long-term neurologic, cognitive, behavioral, developmental, and academic impairment. Since neurologic and developmental difficulties have not been reported as a consequence of neuroblastoma or its treatment, it is thought that these are exclusively due to the immune mechanism underlying OMS.

One study concludes that: &quot;&quot;Patients with OMA and neuroblastoma have excellent survival but a high risk of neurologic sequelae. Favourable disease stage correlates with a higher risk for development of neurologic sequelae. The role of anti-neuronal antibodies in late sequelae of OMA needs further clarification&quot;.&quot;

Another study states that: &quot;&quot;Residual behavioral, language, and cognitive problems occurred in the majority&quot;.&quot;

==Research==
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts and supports research on various movement disorders, including opsoclonus myoclonus. These studies are focused on finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders, as well as increasing knowledge about them.

==Nomenclature==
OMS was first described by Marcel Kinsbourne in 1962. (The term &#x27;Opsoclonus&#x27; was coined by Orzechowski in 1913, but it was classically described and associated with neuroblastoma by Kinsbourne). Other names for OMS include:
* Dancing Eyes-Dancing Feet syndrome
* Dancing Eyes syndrome (see also Nystagmus)
* Kinsbourne syndrome
* Myoclonic Encephalopathy of Infants (MEI), not to be confused with Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME)
* Opsoclonic Cerebellopathy
* Opsoclonus-Myoclonus-Ataxia (OMA)
* Paraneoplastic Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Ataxia (POMA)

<text>In computer graphics, a texel, texture element, or texture pixel is the fundamental unit of a texture map. Textures are represented by arrays of texels representing the texture space, just as other images are represented by arrays of pixels.

Texels can also be described by image regions that are obtained through simple procedures such as thresholding. Voronoi tesselation can be used to define their spatial relationships—divisions are made at the midpoints between the centroids of each texel and the centroids of every surrounding texel for the entire texture. This results in each texel centroid having a Voronoi polygon surrounding it, which consists of all points that are closer to its own texel centroid than any other centroid.

==Rendering==
When texturing a 3D surface or surfaces (a process known as texture mapping), the renderer maps texels to appropriate pixels in the geometric fragment (typically a triangle) in the output picture. On modern computers, this operation is accomplished on the graphics processing unit.

The texturing process starts with a location in space. The location can be in world space, but typically it is local to a model space so that the texture moves with the model. A projector function is applied to the location to change the location from a three-element vector (formula_1) to a two-element (formula_2) vector with values ranging from zero to one (uv). These values are multiplied by the resolution of the texture to obtain the location of the texel. When a texel is requested that is not on an integer position, texture filtering is applied.

When a texel is requested that is outside of the texture, one of two techniques is used: clamping or wrapping. Clamping limits the texel to the texture size, moving it to the nearest edge if it is more than the texture size. Wrapping moves the texel in increments of the texture&#x27;s size to bring it back into the texture. Wrapping causes a texture to be repeated; clamping causes it to be in one spot only.

<doc id="877334" wikidata="Q930079" url="?curid=877334" title="Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds">
<text>Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds is a Spanish-Japanese children&#x27;s animated television series that adapts the classic 1844 Alexandre Dumas story of d&#x27;Artagnan and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, produced by Spanish studio BRB Internacional with animation by Japanese studio Nippon Animation, that was first broadcast on MBS in Japan in 1981–82.

Most of the characters in the series are anthropomorphizations of dogs, hence the title of the cartoon, although there are a few exceptions, most notably Dogtanian&#x27;s two sidekicks Pip the mouse and Planchet the bear, among several others.

In 1985, BRB Internacional released a television film edited from the series entitled &quot;Dogtanian: Special&quot;. In 1989, they produced with Televisión Española and Thames Television a sequel series entitled &quot;The Return of Dogtanian&quot;. In 1995, they released a television film edited from the sequel series entitled &quot;Dogtanian: One For All and All For One&quot;. In 2021, Apolo Films (BRB International&#x27;s cinema studio) and Cosmos Maya released a feature-length CGI film entitled &quot;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&quot; in cinemas.

==Plot==
The story, set in 17th-century France, follows a young Dogtanian (D&#x27;Artagnan (ダルタニヤン) in the original Japanese version and voiced by Satomi Majima (間嶋 里美) and D&#x27;Artacán in the Spanish version) who travels from Béarn to Paris in order to become one of King Louis XIII of France&#x27;s musketeers (they are referred to as musketeers throughout the cartoon and only the title calls them &#x27;Muskehounds&#x27;). He quickly befriends three musketeers (Porthos, Athos and Aramis), saving Juliette, a maid-in-waiting for Queen Anne of Austria. A key difference between the English-language dubs of the &quot;Dogtanian&quot; adaptions and Dumas&#x27; novel is that the names of Athos and Porthos were interchanged, making Athos the extrovert and Porthos the secretive noble of the group.

==Production==
&quot;Dogtanian&quot; stemmed from Claudio Biern Boyd&#x27;s love for literature. As a child, before television arrived in Spain (the first broadcast was in 1956), he enjoyed reading works by authors such as Jules Verne, Emilio Salgari, Alexandre Dumas (père), Karl May and Edmondo de Amicis, while imagining the situations in the books he read. By the time he was part of the newly-formed BRB Internacional, after signing important contracts with animation studios for broadcast and merchandising, Claudio decided to do an original series instead, based on his favorite childhood books. 

After adapting &quot;Cantar del mío Cid&quot; as &quot;Ruy el pequeño Cid&quot;, he adapted Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and set the main characters as dogs, with the starting point being a two-part Salvat encyclopedia on them, costing 25pts. The species were defined according to his imagination. For the villains, Milady was set as a cat, an animal Claudio hated, and Richelieu was set as a fox in homage of a village he spent summers for years where the local villagers complained about a fox that raided henhouses at night. As of 2021, Claudio owned a bulldog, which in the series was the species of Richelieu&#x27;s guard. Moreover, Dogtanian was chosen as a beagle in homage to Charles M. Schulz&#x27; character Snoopy, for which Claudio had an affinity for.

As with his early series, pre-production work was done in Spain and post-production work in Japan at Nippon Animation&#x27;s facilities in Tokyo. On the Spanish side, the series was directed by Luis Ballester and Claudio Biern Boyd, with the latter supervising the script, while in Japan, Shigeo Koshi was at the helm of the department while Shuuichi Seki served as the series&#x27; character designer.

Adapting the novel was complicated, mostly due to its length and tragedy. BRB&#x27;s scripwriting theme created a &quot;clean and polished&quot; product, removing most of the dark undertones of the original novel: the novel was set in a chaotic period of French history, with violence happening throughout. The Musketeers in the original work had the following characteristics: Athos was an alcoholic, Porthos the lover of a woman married to a rich man, whose only way to marry was with the death of her husband. D&#x27;Artagnan himself was an adulterer, courting his two loves, Milady and Constance. Much of these characteristics were removed from BRB&#x27;s adaptation.

The choice of anthropomorphic characters was cheaper and removed traces of violence found in the original work. This style was not new for Nippon Animation, having done several animated series before where the characters were all anthropomorphic animals. These were made as such to be more attractive to children, expressing the way of being of the characters in a more direct manner. Dogtanian and the Muskehounds are portrayed with more &quot;rounded&quot; characteristics while the villains, especially Richelieu, were drawn in a more aggressive style. Milady, a cat, also represents the animal&#x27;s association with stealth and espionage.

The series was produced in 1981 by BRB International and Nippon Animation and was first broadcast by MBS in Japan, where it began airing on 9 October of that year. A year after its premiere, it was broadcast for the first time in Spain on Televisión Española&#x27;s Primera Cadena on 9 October 1982. The partnership between BRB International and Nippon Animation worked so well, that they collaborated again to work on another successful animated series two years later called &quot;Around the World with Willy Fog&quot;.

==Broadcast==
The series first aired in Japan on the 20 of the 25 stations of the Japan News Network (TBS) at the time, in block, with the Mainichi Broadcasting System responsible for co-production. The series aired on Fridays at 7pm during its run. Unlike in certain markets, ratings in Japan during its first run were sluggish, reporting only 4% ratings in the Kanto area. Due to poor viewer performance, MBS withdrew from producing animated shows for the 7pm timeslot and Calpis withdrew from sponsorship. After it ended, it was replaced by &quot;Jarinko Chie&quot; in its timeslot, which had been moved from a 5pm Saturday slot on a handful of affiliates and was finally shown on much of the network as consequence. The series competed with &quot;Ninja Hattori-kun&quot;, and despite competition from similar shows at the time, merchandising was released in Japan.

The series premiered in Spain in 1982, and it only aired on TVE1 due to scheduling problems. This marked the premiere of the series in Europe. Before long, it was sold to numerous TV channels around the world, including RTP in Portugal, RAI in Italy, the BBC in the United Kingdom and TF1 in France, to high ratings. In Brazil, it aired on Rede Manchete in 1984 as part of the children&#x27;s show &quot;Clube da Criança&quot; when Xuxa Meneghel was its host. It was repeated until 1986 on other children&#x27;s programs shown on the network. The success of the show in Brazil caused Editora Riográfica (later Editora Globo) to import the comics based on the series from Spain. In the mid-2000s, the compilation film, released there under the home video title &quot;Lord Dog&quot;, aired on TV Brasília in the period when the station had disaffiliated itself from RedeTV!.

The series was dubbed into English by Intersound USA in 1985. As well as dubbing the TV series, BRB also produced a TV film, which was again dubbed by Intersound USA. The series was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC on January 3, 1985 and on The Disney Channel in the United States from 1986 to 1988.

==Home media==
===UK VHS releases===
In the United Kingdom during the late 1980s, Video Collection International Ltd. released multiple episodes of &quot;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&quot; on VHS after its broadcast on the BBC from 1985 to 1987, and its reruns on ITV from 1988 to 1990.

===DVD releases===
The series has been released on DVD in the UK by Revelation Films in Region 0 format:
* Episodes 1–9: 28 April 2003
* Episodes 10–15: 25 August 2003
* Episodes 16–20: 22 March 2004
* Episodes 21–26: 25 May 2004
* &quot;Dogtanian - The Complete Series Boxset&quot;: 20 September 2004
* The television films &quot;Dogtanian: Special&quot; and &quot;Dogtanian: One For All And All For One&quot;: 26 July 2004.

In November 2010, a version that contains both series and both television films was released exclusively to HMV. The complete boxset was later made available at other retailers.

The complete series was released on DVD in the U.S. in 2012 by Oasis DVDs.

===Streaming===
The series can be found on different platforms such as YouTube and Netflix.

===Soundtrack===
The original version of the soundtrack to &quot;Dogtanian&quot; (called &quot;Dartacan Soundtrack&quot;) can be downloaded from Amazon&#x27;s UK website in MP3 format. It includes an English version of the theme song that uses the second series opening lyrics, but the music is similar to the original opening. In this version Dogtanian is referred to as Dartacan, his Spanish name, and the theme is sung with high voices, similar to the original opening, and rendered in a style reminiscent of the French dub. It includes insert song in Spanish which has been replicated twice (Richelieu and Bulibu, probably an error on Amazon&#x27;s part or that of the record company) and a few instrumental tracks that are heard in the show itself and one unused instrumental track.

==Television film==
In 1985, BRB Internacional released a television film edited from the series entitled &quot;Dogtanian: Special&quot;.

==Sequel==

In 1989 a sequel series entitled &quot;The Return of Dogtanian&quot; was produced by BRB Internacional, Televisión Española and Thames Television with animation of Wang Film Productions and Morning Sun Animation. The outsourcing had changed a few years earlier due to a price hike at Nippon Animation. Like the first series, 26 episodes were produced.

In 1995, BRB Internacional released a television film edited from this second series entitled &quot;Dogtanian: One For All and All For One&quot;.

==Film==

BRB Internacional was planning a new feature-length CGI film and was originally planned to be released in 2016, but was delayed for unknown reasons. In April 2019, Apolo Films, their new cinema studio, took over production of the film. The film was written by Doug Langdale and directed by Toni Garcia. The film was released in theaters under the title &quot;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&quot;. It was released on SVOD.

The film maintains the original series opening main theme tune composed by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis. Additionally, they have composed new songs for the film.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on 25 June 2021.

<text>In computer graphics, texture filtering or texture smoothing is the method used to determine the texture color for a texture mapped pixel, using the colors of nearby texels (ie. pixels of the texture).

Filtering describes how a texture is applied at many different shapes, size, angles and scales. Depending on the chosen filter algorithm, the result will show varying degrees of blurriness, detail, spatial aliasing, temporal aliasing and blocking. Depending on the circumstances, filtering can be performed in software (such as a software rendering package) or in hardware, eg. with either real time or GPU accelerated rendering circuits, or in a mixture of both. For most common interactive graphical applications, modern texture filtering is performed by dedicated hardware which optimizes memory access through memory cacheing and pre-fetch, and implements a selection of algorithms available to the user and developer.

There are two main categories of texture filtering: magnification filtering and minification filtering. Depending on the situation, texture filtering is either a type of reconstruction filter where sparse data is interpolated to fill gaps (magnification), or a type of anti-aliasing (AA) where texture samples exist at a higher frequency than required for the sample frequency needed for texture fill (minification).

There are many methods of texture filtering, which make different trade-offs between computational complexity, memory bandwidth and image quality.

==The need for filtering==
During the texture mapping process for any arbitrary 3D surface, a &quot;&quot; takes place to find out where on the texture each pixel center falls. For texture-mapped polygonal surfaces composed of triangles typical of most surfaces in 3D games and movies, every pixel (or subordinate pixel sample) of that surface will be associated with some triangle(s) and a set of barycentric coordinates, which are used to provide a position within a texture. Such a position may not lie perfectly on the &quot;pixel grid,&quot; necessitating some function to account for these cases. In other words, since the textured surface may be at an arbitrary distance and orientation relative to the viewer, one pixel does not usually correspond directly to one texel. Some form of filtering has to be applied to determine the best color for the pixel. Insufficient or incorrect filtering will show up in the image as artifacts (errors in the image), such as &#x27;blockiness&#x27;, jaggies, or shimmering.

There can be different types of correspondence between a pixel and the texel/texels it represents on the screen. These depend on the position of the textured surface relative to the viewer, and different forms of filtering are needed in each case. Given a square texture mapped on to a square surface in the world, at some viewing distance the size of one screen pixel is exactly the same as one texel. Closer than that, the texels are larger than screen pixels, and need to be scaled up appropriately — a process known as &quot;texture magnification&quot;. Farther away, each texel is smaller than a pixel, and so one pixel covers multiple texels. In this case an appropriate color has to be picked based on the covered texels, via &quot;texture minification&quot;. Graphics APIs such as OpenGL allow the programmer to set different choices for minification and magnification filters.

Note that even in the case where the pixels and texels are exactly the same size, one pixel will not necessarily match up exactly to one texel. It may be misaligned or rotated, and cover parts of up to four neighboring texels. Hence some form of filtering is still required.

==Mipmapping==
Mipmapping is a standard technique used to save some of the filtering work needed during texture minification. It is also highly beneficial for cache coherency - without it the memory access pattern during sampling from distant textures will exhibit extremely poor locality, adversely affecting performance even if no filtering is performed.

During texture magnification, the number of texels that need to be looked up for any pixel is always four or fewer; during minification, however, as the textured polygon moves farther away potentially the &quot;entire texture&quot; might fall into a single pixel. This would necessitate reading all of its texels and combining their values to correctly determine the pixel color, a prohibitively expensive operation. Mipmapping avoids this by prefiltering the texture and storing it in smaller sizes down to a single pixel. As the textured surface moves farther away, the texture being applied switches to the prefiltered smaller size. Different sizes of the mipmap are referred to as &#x27;levels&#x27;, with Level 0 being the largest size (used closest to the viewer), and increasing levels used at increasing distances.

==Filtering methods==
This section lists the most common texture filtering methods, in increasing order of computational cost and image quality.

===Nearest-neighbor interpolation===
Nearest-neighbor interpolation is the simplest and crudest filtering method — it simply uses the color of the texel closest to the pixel center for the pixel color. While simple, this results in a large number of artifacts - texture &#x27;blockiness&#x27; during magnification, and aliasing and shimmering during minification. This method is fast during magnification but during minification the stride through memory becomes arbitrarily large and it can often be less efficient than MIP-mapping due to the lack of spatially coherent texture access and cache-line reuse.

===Nearest-neighbor with mipmapping===
This method still uses nearest neighbor interpolation, but adds mipmapping — first the nearest mipmap level is chosen according to distance, then the nearest texel center is sampled to get the pixel color. This reduces the aliasing and shimmering significantly during minification but does not eliminate it entirely. In doing so it improves texture memory access and cache-line reuse through avoiding arbitrarily large access strides through texture memory during rasterization. This does not help with blockiness during magnification as each magnified texel will still appear as a large rectangle.

===Linear mipmap filtering===
Less commonly used, OpenGL and other APIs support nearest-neighbor sampling from individual mipmaps whilst linearly interpolating the two nearest mipmaps relevant to the sample.

===Bilinear filtering===
In Bilinear filtering, the four nearest texels to the pixel center are sampled (at the closest mipmap level), and their colors are combined by weighted average according to distance. This removes the &#x27;blockiness&#x27; seen during magnification, as there is now a smooth gradient of color change from one texel to the next, instead of an abrupt jump as the pixel center crosses the texel boundary. Bilinear filtering for magnification filtering is common. When used for minification it is often used with mipmapping; though it can be used without, it would suffer the same aliasing and shimmering problems as nearest-neighbor filtering when minified too much. For modest minification ratios, however, it can be used as an inexpensive hardware accelerated weighted texture supersample.

The Nintendo 64 used an unusual version of bilinear filtering where only three pixels are used known as 3-point texture filtering, instead of four due to hardware optimization concerns. This introduces a noticeable &quot;triangulation bias&quot; in some textures.

===Trilinear filtering===
Trilinear filtering is a remedy to a common artifact seen in mipmapped bilinearly filtered images: an abrupt and very noticeable change in quality at boundaries where the renderer switches from one mipmap level to the next. Trilinear filtering solves this by doing a texture lookup and bilinear filtering on the &quot;two&quot; closest mipmap levels (one higher and one lower quality), and then linearly interpolating the results. This results in a smooth degradation of texture quality as distance from the viewer increases, rather than a series of sudden drops. Of course, closer than Level 0 there is only one mipmap level available, and the algorithm reverts to bilinear filtering.

===Anisotropic filtering===
Anisotropic filtering is the highest quality filtering available in current consumer 3D graphics cards. Simpler, &quot;isotropic&quot; techniques use only square mipmaps which are then interpolated using bi– or trilinear filtering. (&quot;Isotropic&quot; means same in all directions, and hence is used to describe a system in which all the maps are squares rather than rectangles or other quadrilaterals.)

When a surface is at a high angle relative to the camera, the fill area for a texture will not be approximately square. Consider the common case of a floor in a game: the fill area is far wider than it is tall. In this case, none of the square maps are a good fit. The result is blurriness and/or shimmering, depending on how the fit is chosen. Anisotropic filtering corrects this by sampling the texture as a non-square shape. The goal is to sample a texture to match the pixel footprint as projected into texture space, and such a footprint is not always axis aligned to the texture. Further, when dealing with sample theory a pixel is not a little square therefore its footprint would not be a projected square. Footprint assembly in texture space samples some approximation of the computed function of a projected pixel in texture space but the details are often approximate, highly proprietary and steeped in opinions about sample theory. Conceptually though the goal is to sample a more correct anisotropic sample of appropriate orientation to avoid the conflict between aliasing on one axis vs. blurring on the other when projected size differs.

In anisotropic implementations, the filtering may incorporate the same filtering algorithms used to filter the square maps of traditional mipmapping during the construction of the intermediate or final result.

===Percentage Closer filtering===
Depth-based shadow mapping can use an interesting Percentage Closer Filter (PCF) with depth-mapped textures that broadens one&#x27;s perception of the kinds of texture filters that might be applied. In PCF a depth map of the scene is rendered from the light source. During the subsequent rendering of the scene this depth map is then projected back into the scene from the position of the light and a comparison is performed between the projective depth coordinate and the fetched texture sample depth. The projective coordinate will be the scene pixels depth from the light but the fetched depth from the depth map will represent the depth of the scene along that projected direction. In this way a determination of visibility to the light and therefore illumination by the light can be made for the rendered pixel. So this texturing operation is a Boolean test of whether the pixel is lit, however multiple samples can be tested for a given pixel and the Boolean results summed and averaged. In this way in combination with varying parameters like sampled texel location and even jittered depth map projection location a post-depth-comparison average or percentage of samples closer and therefore illuminated can be computed for a pixel. Critically, the summation of Boolean results and generation of a percentage value must be performed after the depth comparison of projective depth and sample fetch, so this depth comparison becomes an integral part of the texture filter. This percentage can then be used to weight an illumination calculation and provide not just a Boolean illumination or shadow value but a soft shadow penumbra result. A version of this is supported in modern hardware where a comparison is performed and a post Boolean comparison bilinear filter by distance is applied

<doc id="877343" wikidata="Q3179466" url="?curid=877343" title="Heung Yee Kuk">
<text>The Heung Yee Kuk, officially the Heung Yee Kuk N.T., is a statutory advisory body representing establishment interests in the New Territories, Hong Kong. The council is a powerful organisation comprising heads of rural committees which represent villages and market towns.

From 1980 to 2015, it was chaired by Lau Wong-fat, a billionaire landowner and heavyweight political figure in the pro-Beijing camp, until he stepped down and was succeeded by his son Kenneth Lau.

The organisation has its own functional constituency seat in the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Despite having less than 150 registered voters, it also controls 26 seats on the 1200-member committee which selects the chief executive of Hong Kong.

==Background==

In 1906, eight years after the lease of the New Territories from the Qing China began, the British colonial government of Hong Kong interceded in the land rights of indigenous male villagers by converting those rights to block crown leases (on which crown rent was payable) over village land, creating significant discontent among villagers. The growing antagonism between villagers and the administration was exacerbated when, in 1923, the government imposed restraints on building of village houses on land held by villagers under the leases, including imposing a tax (known as a premium) on permission to build if granted.

Tensions, whipped up by the newly formed Chinese Communist Party, boiled over in 1925 and the major upheavals of the Canton–Hong Kong strike crippled Hong Kong.

==History==
It was in these circumstances that the Heung Yee Kuk was formed the next year from the New Territories Association of Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Research, to &quot;work and negotiate with the government to promote the welfare of the people of the New Territories&quot;. It was given formal status by the &quot;Heung Yee Kuk Ordinance (Chapter 1097)&quot;, first enacted 11 December 1959 (originally as no. 45 of 1959) amid the construction of the first New Towns in the New Territories. The Kuk then consisted of 27 Rural Committees representing, in turn, 651 villages. All village representatives on the Rural Committees, generally appointed by village consensus but sometimes by election, had to be male heads of households. After just one such election was found to have been rigged in 1957, the government withdrew recognition of the Kuk entirely. The committees were, in any event, only representative of indigenous villagers, excluding large swathes of the New Territories population right from the Kuk&#x27;s earliest days.

After becoming a statutory advisory body, the Kuk met regularly with the New Territories Administration to discuss local issues and influence government policies. Tension came to a head in 1971 when a gathering of a thousand villagers in protest at government Small House Policy was described by the New Territories Commissioner Denis Bray as a &quot;village uprising&quot;.

As part of administrative reforms proposed by McKinsey in 1974, the colonial government established the position of Secretary for the New Territories to communicate with the Kuk and prepare for development of the area.

Over the years the organisation has dabbled in charity work. For example, in 1966 it donated HK$660,000 to found the Heung Yee Kuk Yuen Long District Secondary School, in Yuen Long.

The Kuk is almost exclusively operated by men. In 1994, legislator Christine Loh attempted to allow female villagers the same land-inheritance rights as men, but the Kuk protested, claiming that granting females equal inheritance rights would interfere with rural issues. The Kuk sent 25 members to London to protest against the bill, which eventually passed despite their protests.

The Kuk was also involved with the Wang Chau housing controversy, where a planned development was downsized in the interests of the Kuk.

In October 2023, local news reported that the Kuk did not support building public housing on parts of the Hong Kong Golf Club.

== Small House Policy ==

The Kuk advocates for the Small House Policy, a male-only policy which discriminates against female villagers. According to Apple Daily, males are entitled to build a house, worth approximately US$2,600,000 at around a cost of about US$700,000. Some villagers own the land for five years, and then illegally sell it to developers in a process called &quot;flipping.&quot;

In April 2019, the High Court ruled that two out of three methods for obtaining a small house grant (private treaty grants and exchanges) would become banned. The Kuk threatened to ask Beijing for help if an appeal to the April 2019 ruling was not granted, in addition to spending HKD $30M on the first round of judicial review. Despite the Small House Policy being a generous government policy that helps male villagers obtain housing, Kingsley Sit Ho-yin, director of the Kuk&#x27;s think tank, the Heung Yee Kuk Research Centre, said &quot;Rural villagers have no responsibility to help the government solve the housing shortage. Villagers also face a land shortage. Why does the government not take back more land for us to build small houses?&quot;

<text>Close Combat is a series of real-time computer wargames by Atomic Games. In the &quot;Close Combat&quot; series, the player takes control of a small unit (platoon or company sized) of troops and leads them in battles of World War II from a top down 2D perspective.

==History==
&quot;Close Combat&quot; was developed as a computer game version of the acclaimed Avalon Hill board game &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; (ASL). The primary consultant for the morale model was Dr. Steven Silver, a specialist in combat-related trauma. Atomic Games had already developed several games for Avalon Hill, such as &quot;Operation Crusader&quot; and &quot;Stalingrad&quot;. However, with Avalon Hill embroiled in a financial crisis that would ultimately lead to its demise, Atomic Games took what work they had completed, severed ties with the board game franchise and completed the game&#x27;s development for Microsoft. The first three &quot;Close Combat&quot; games were notable, at the time, for being among the few games published by Microsoft. The final two games in the original series were, however, published by Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI).

&quot;Close Combat I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; were distributed for both Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS. Later versions were released for Microsoft Windows only.
In 2005, Atomic Games was bought by Destineer. Destineer licensed the game to Matrix Games to develop three more Close Combat titles. Matrix Games hired first CSO Simtek and later Strategy 3 Tactics to develop these titles.

The five original &quot;Close Combat&quot; games were real-time computer wargames, with a top-down perspective and two-player capabilities. Each was set in a different European theatre of the Second World War. Each game included a mixture of infantry and armoured units, whilst the later games also included artillery, mortars and air support. Although viewed from a top-down perspective, the later games modelled terrain elevation, and included buildings with multiple floors and viewable sides. The overall tone emphasised realism, and modelled the emotional or physical state of the soldiers and equipment which included, panicked, berserk, burning, incapacitated, pinned and many others.

===Games===
==Gameplay==
The game contains a number of gameplay elements:
*Mental condition: Close Combat used a psychological (morale) model for each individual combatant. The combatant&#x27;s morale would be affected by factors such as being near officers, being supported by other units, being under fire, taking casualties, and being left without orders. Troops would be &quot;Stable&quot; when they were in no danger; &quot;Cowering&quot; when pinned down by enemy fire; or &quot;Panicked&quot; when surrounded by dead comrades, wounded or near enemy flamethrowers. The use of a psychological model made certain tactics, common in RTS games where the units will follow suicidal orders, impossible in Close Combat. For example, attempting a &quot;rush&quot; in &quot;Close Combat&quot; would result in units seeking cover, refusing to obey orders or even deserting.
* Experience: In Close Combat, reserve units or newly replaced troops would fire and move more slowly and be more likely to panic. Because of this, they would be unlikely to prevail against veteran troops. This is unlike most RTS games where all troops of a particular type act similarly.
* Ammunition levels: The game also modelled the amount of ammunition each unit possessed. Troops in a heavy fire-fight would quickly run out of ammunition. Once out of ammunition they would resort to bayonet fighting, or surrender to any enemies that approached them, although they could also scavenge weapons or ammunition from fallen friendly and enemy soldiers. This is in contrast to most RTS games, where units have unlimited ammunition supplies.
* Scavenging: Starting from the third installment in the series, soldiers that expended all ammo could be moved into close vicinity of dead soldiers to take their ammunition. If no ammunition was present at times they would pick up whatever weapon the dead soldier had. Enemy weapons could be picked up as well. However, enemy ammo cannot be scavenged by itself.
* Physical state: In Close Combat, troops could be &quot;Healthy&quot;; &quot;Injured&quot; by enemy fire (in which case they would move and fire more slowly); &quot;Incapacitated&quot; if enemy fire caused the soldier to be unable to fight; and finally &quot;Dead&quot;. This is in contrast to most RTS games, where units fight and move regardless of their closeness to death.
* Stamina: In Close Combat, troops could be &quot;Rested&quot;; &quot;Winded&quot; after exerting themselves, in which case they would move slowly until they were rested again; and &quot;Fatigued&quot;, after prolonged exertion, slowing them down for the rest of the battle. This is in contrast to most RTS games, where units do not tire.

==Tactics==
The factors above meant that the game required realistic military tactics, such as careful placement of troops in cover, ambush, advancing under cover and using terrain or smoke-screens to cover advancing troops. Effective management, such as keeping teams near their officers, not sending green recruits on assaults and maintaining fire discipline so as not to run out of ammunition were also necessary for the player to prevail.

Players also have to make effective use of combined-arms tactics to be successful in Close Combat. Infantry assault require support from machine guns, tanks, and mortars, to suppress enemy fire. Armor units also require screening from infantry units. Although they possess superior firepower, tanks are vulnerable to ambushes from bazooka or panzerschreck units, especially in close quarters such as a town or forest, where the ambushing infantry can wait to have a shot at a tank&#x27;s vulnerable flank or rear armor. Tanks are also vulnerable to fire from concealed anti-tank guns, or ambushing tanks, which may wait to fire until the enemy presents his flank or rear.

==Multiplayer==
All versions except &quot;Close Combat: Modern Tactics&quot; offer only one vs one multiplayer. &quot;Modern Tactics&quot; offers three on three and &quot;Close Combat: Marines&quot; offers four on four, although these versions added more multiplayer ability.

==Remakes==
Four of the five original games, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, &quot;The Russian Front&quot;, &quot;The Battle of the Bulge&quot; and &quot;Invasion Normandy&quot; have since been remade with new units and maps, updated graphics (maps and sprites) and sound, updated map editors, menus, as well as fixing the compatibility issues that the older iterations of each game had with modern operating systems. Each remake, with the exception of &quot;Last Stand Arnhem&quot;, also includes the original version of the game that can be played without any of the additions included in the remake.

==Reception==
&quot;Close Combat&quot; was commercially successful, with worldwide sales of roughly 200,000 units by 1999. Zabalaoui said that the game outsold Atomic Games&#x27; earlier efforts by around ten to one.

Like its predecessor, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; achieved worldwide sales of roughly 200,000 units by 1999. Atomic Games&#x27; head Keith Zabalaoui said that the first two &quot;Close Combat&quot; titles each outsold the company&#x27;s earlier games by around ten to one.

In the United States, &quot;Close Combat III&quot; sold 45,438 copies during 1999, and was the year&#x27;s best-selling wargame.

The first five &quot;Close Combat&quot; games totaled 1.2 million units in sales by April 2004. By 2018, the combined sales of the series&#x27; 17 entries had surpassed 5 million units.

<doc id="877348" wikidata="Q392208" url="?curid=877348" title="Trilinear filtering">
<text>Trilinear filtering is an extension of the bilinear texture filtering method, which also performs linear interpolation between mipmaps.

Bilinear filtering has several weaknesses that make it an unattractive choice in many cases: using it on a full-detail texture when scaling to a very small size causes accuracy problems from missed texels, and compensating for this by using multiple mipmaps throughout the polygon leads to abrupt changes in blurriness, which is most pronounced in polygons that are steeply angled relative to the camera.

To solve this problem, trilinear filtering interpolates between the results of bilinear filtering on the two mipmaps nearest to the detail required for the polygon at the pixel. If the pixel would take up 1/100 of the texture in one direction, trilinear filtering would interpolate between the result of filtering the 128×128 mipmap as y1 with x1 as 128, and the result of filtering on the 64×64 mipmap as y2 with x2 as 64, and then interpolate to .

The first step in this process is to determine how big in terms of the texture the pixel in question is. There are a few ways to do this, and the ones mentioned here are not necessarily representative of all of them.

* Use the distance along the texture between the current pixel and the pixel to its right (or left, or above, or below) as the size of the pixel.
* Use the smallest (or biggest, or average) of the various sizes determined by using the above method.
* Determine the uv-values of the corners of the pixel, use those to calculate the area of the pixel, and figure out how many pixels of exactly the same size would take up the whole texture.

Once this is done, bilinear filtering is carried out on the two mipmaps with pixel sizes that are immediately larger and smaller than the calculated size of the pixel, and then interpolate between them as normal.

Since it uses both larger and smaller mipmaps, trilinear filtering cannot be used in places where the pixel is smaller than a texel on the original texture, because mipmaps larger than the original texture are not defined. Bilinear filtering still works, and can be used in these situations without worrying too much about abruptness because bilinear and trilinear filtering provide the same result when the pixel size is exactly the same as the size of a texel on the appropriate mipmap.

Trilinear filtering still has weaknesses, because the pixel is still assumed to take up a square area on the texture. In particular, when a texture is at a steep angle compared to the camera, detail can be lost because the pixel actually takes up a narrow but long trapezoid: in the narrow direction, the pixel is getting information from more texels than it actually covers (so details are smeared), and in the long direction the pixel is getting information from fewer texels than it actually covers (so details fall between pixels). To alleviate this, anisotropic (&quot;direction dependent&quot;) filtering can be used.

<doc id="877353" wikidata="Q3984114" url="?curid=877353" title="Oral polio vaccine AIDS hypothesis">
<text>According to a now-discredited hypothesis, the AIDS pandemic originated from live polio vaccines prepared in chimpanzee tissue cultures, accidentally contaminated with simian immunodeficiency virus and then administered to up to one million Africans between 1957 and 1960 in experimental mass vaccination campaigns.

Data analyses in molecular biology and phylogenetic studies contradict the OPV AIDS hypothesis; consequently, scientific consensus regards the hypothesis as disproven. A 2004 &quot;Nature&quot; article has described the hypothesis as &quot;refuted&quot;.

== Background: polio vaccines ==

Two vaccines are used throughout the world to combat poliomyelitis. The first, a polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk, is an &quot;inactivated poliovirus vaccine&quot; (IPV), consisting of a mixture of three wild, virulent strains of poliovirus, grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), and made noninfectious by formaldehyde treatment. The second vaccine, an &quot;oral polio vaccine&quot; (OPV), is a live-attenuated vaccine, produced by the passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature. The passage of virus produces mutations within the viral genome, and hinders the virus&#x27;s ability to infect nervous tissue.

Both vaccines have been used for decades to induce immunity to polio, and to stop the spread of the infection. However, OPV has several advantages; because the vaccine is introduced in the gastrointestinal tract, the primary site of poliovirus infection and replication, it closely mimics a natural infection. OPV also provides long lasting immunity, and stimulates the production of polio neutralizing antibodies in the pharynx and gut. Hence, OPV not only prevents paralytic poliomyelitis, but also, when given in sufficient doses, can stop a threatening epidemic. Other benefits of OPV include ease of administration, low cost and suitability for mass vaccination campaigns.

=== Oral polio vaccine ===
Oral polio vaccines were developed in the late 1950s by several groups, including those led by Albert Sabin, Hilary Koprowski and H. R. Cox. A poliovirus type 1 strain called SM was reported in 1954. A less virulent version of the SM strain was reported by Koprowski in 1957. The name of the vaccine strain was &quot;CHAT&quot; after &quot;Charlton&quot;, the name of the child who was the donor of the precursor virus. The Sabin, Koprowski and Cox vaccines were clinically tested in millions of individuals and found to be safe and effective. Because monkey trials found fewer side effects with the Sabin vaccine, in the early 1960s, the Sabin vaccine was licensed in the US and its use supported by the World Health Organization.

Between 1957 and 1960, Koprowski&#x27;s vaccine was administered to roughly one million people in the Belgian territories, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. In 1960, Koprowski wrote in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, &quot;The Belgian Congo trials have enlarged considerably and ... more vaccination campaigns organized in several provinces of the Belgian Congo are raising the number of vaccinated individuals into the millions.&quot;&quot;(p. 90)&quot; Koprowski and his group also published a series of detailed reports on the vaccination of 76,000 children under the age of five (and European adults) in the area of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in Belgian Congo from 1958 to 1960; these reports begin with an overview, next a review of safety and efficacy, then a 21-month follow-up and final report.

=== Vaccine production ===
In the 1950s, before dangers inherent to the process were well controlled, seed stocks of vaccines were occasionally transported to distant regions, then standard tissue culture methods were used to amplify the virus at local production facilities. Biologic products, chiefly kidney cells for cultures and blood serum for media, were sometimes harvested from local primates and used in the production process if wild or captive populations of appropriate species were available. In South Africa, African green monkey tissue was used to amplify the Sabin vaccine. In French West Africa and Equatorial Africa, baboons were used to amplify a vaccine from the Pasteur Institute. In Poland, the CHAT vaccine was amplified using Asian macaques.

== Development of hypothesis ==
In 1987, Blaine Elswood contacted journalist Tom Curtis about a &quot;bombshell story&quot; on OPV and AIDS. Curtis published an article on the OPV AIDS hypothesis in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1992. In response, Hilary Koprowski sued &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and Tom Curtis for defamation. The magazine published a clarification which praised Koprowski and stated:
 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was ordered to pay US$1 in damages whilst incurring around US$500,000 in legal fees for its own defense.

A few scientists, notably the evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton, thought the hypothesis required serious investigation, but they received little support from the scientific community. For example, in 1996, &quot;Science&quot; refused to publish a letter Hamilton sent to it in which he replied to a 1992 Koprowski letter. Hamilton kept his position and said in 1999, &quot;This theory, rather sadly, has gone from strength to strength. It&#x27;s not proven by any means, but it&#x27;s looking very strong.&quot; Hamilton was also supportive of journalist Edward Hooper who detailed the hypothesis in his 1999 book, &quot;The River&quot;. Hamilton wrote the foreword for the book and did two expeditions to Congo between December 1999 and January 2000 to collect evidences on the OPV hypothesis. None of the over 60 urine and faecal samples collected by Hamilton contained SIV. Still, Hamilton used his prestige within the Royal Society to promote a discussion meeting about the OPV hypothesis. In this meeting, held six months after Hamilton&#x27;s death, in September 2000, Hooper further expanded on his allegations, although these claims were later rebutted by some of the scientists who were present at the meeting. In 2001, Hilary Koprowski responded by making a detailed rebuttal of the points made in the book, also in a talk to the Royal Society. In 2004, the &quot;Origin of Aids&quot;, a French TV documentary strongly supportive of the OPV hypothesis, appeared on several television stations around the world.

In 2003, Hooper published additional statements that he believed supported his hypothesis in an article in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. These included accounts of an interview with Jacques Kanyama, a virology technician at the lab in Stanleyville (the Laboratoire Médical de Stanleyville (LMS)) responsible for testing the CHAT vaccine and performing the initial set of vaccinations, who was reported to have said that batches of CHAT had been produced on site by Paul Osterrieth. In addition, Philip Elebe, a microbiology technician, was claimed to have said that tissue cultures were being produced from Lindi chimpanzees. Osterrieth has denied these claims and stated that this work would not have been possible in this laboratory, stating that:

In his book, Hooper also stated that Gaston Ninane was involved in using chimpanzee cells to produce vaccine in Congo. Ninane responded to this allegation by stating that he could &quot;categorically deny&quot; ever having tried to make tissue cultures from chimpanzee cells. The people involved in vaccine production and distribution from America state that no vaccine was prepared locally in Congo and that only the CHAT vaccine from America was used. Barbara Cohen, the technician who was responsible for running the American laboratory that produced this vaccine stated:

== Scientific investigation ==

In an August 1992 letter published in &quot;Science&quot;, Koprowski repudiated the OPV AIDS hypothesis, pointing to multiple errors of fact in its assertions. In October 1992, &quot;Science&quot; ran a story titled &quot;Panel Nixes Congo Vaccine as AIDS source&quot;, describing the findings of an independent panel which found each proposed step in the OPV-AIDS hypothesis &quot;problematic&quot;. The story concluded:
The oldest confirmed sample of human tissue that shows the presence of HIV-1 is an archival sample of plasma collected from an anonymous donor in the city of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1959 and was found with retrospective genetic analysis to be most closely related to subtype D strains. In 2008, partial HIV viral sequences were identified from a specimen of lymph node collected from an adult female, also in Kinshasa, in 1960. This specimen, named DRC60, was around 88% similar to ZR59, but was found to be most closely related to subtype A HIV-1 strains. These specimens are significant not only because they are the oldest specimens of the virus known to cause AIDS, but because they show that the virus already had an extensive amount of genetic diversity in 1960.

In 2000, the Royal Society held a meeting to discuss data on the origin of AIDS; the OPV AIDS hypothesis was a central topic of discussion. At this meeting, three independent labs released the results of tests on the remaining stocks of Koprowski&#x27;s vaccine, which Edward Hooper had demanded in &quot;The River&quot;. The tests confirmed Koprowski&#x27;s contention that his vaccine was made from monkey, rather than chimpanzee, kidney, and found no evidence of SIV or HIV contamination. Additional epidemiologic and phylogenetic data was presented at the conference which undermined other aspects of the OPV AIDS hypothesis. According to a report in &quot;Science&quot;, Hooper &quot;did not challenge the results; he simply dismissed them.&quot;

In 2001, three articles published in &quot;Nature&quot; examined various aspects of the OPV AIDS hypothesis, as did an article published in &quot;Science&quot;. In every case, the studies&#x27; findings argued strongly against any link between the polio vaccine and AIDS. The evidence cited included multiple independent studies that dated the introduction of HIV-1 to humans as occurring between 1915 and 1941, probably in the 1930s. These results were confirmed by a later study using samples from the 1960s that also found that the epidemic began between 1908 and 1930, and a study that showed that although recombination amongst viruses makes dating less precise, it does not significantly bias estimates in either direction (it does not introduce a systematic error).

The author of one of the studies, evolutionary biologist Edward Holmes of Oxford University, commented in light of the new evidence: &quot;Hooper&#x27;s evidence was always flimsy, and now it&#x27;s untenable. It&#x27;s time to move on.&quot; An accompanying editorial in &quot;Nature&quot; concluded:
The possibility that chimpanzees found near Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Stanleyville) were, indirectly, the true source of HIV-1 was directly addressed in a 2004 study published in &quot;Nature&quot;. Here, the authors found that while SIV was present in chimpanzees in the area, the strain of SIV infecting these chimpanzees was phylogenetically distinct from all strains of HIV, providing direct evidence that these particular chimps were not the source of HIV in humans.

== Current oral polio-vaccine campaign in Africa ==
Rumours that polio vaccines are unsafe disrupted the longstanding effort of the WHO and UN to achieve poliomyelitis eradication worldwide through use of the oral polio vaccine of Albert Sabin, which is thought to be safe and effective by virtually all medical authorities. If this long-term public-health goal could be achieved, poliomyelitis would follow smallpox as the second eradicated infectious human disease. The OPV AIDS hypothesis relates only to the historical origin of AIDS, and its proponents have accepted the safety of the modern polio vaccines, but rumors based on a misunderstanding of the hypothesis exist, and those rumors are blamed in part for the recent failure to eliminate polio in Nigeria.

By 2003, cases of poliomyelitis had been reduced to just a small number in isolated regions of West Africa, with sporadic cases elsewhere. However, the disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other nations of Africa, which epidemiologists trace to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to be administered the Sabin oral vaccine. The expressed concerns of local populations often relate to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility, or that it is contaminated with HIV, based on claims made in &quot;The River&quot;. Since 2003, these fears have spread among some in the Muslim community, with Datti Ahmed, of the Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria stating that:

As evidence to the success of polio eradication efforts, the vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) nowadays cause more cases of polio paralysis than the wild type virus itself in many places, such as the Congo. Polio has also resurged in areas of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
