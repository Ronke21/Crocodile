<text>U.S. Route 522 (US 522) is a spur route of US 22 in the states of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The U.S. Highway travels in a north-south direction, and runs from US 60 near Powhatan, Virginia, to its northern terminus at US 11 and US 15 near Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. US 522 serves many small cities and towns in the Piedmont, Blue Ridge Mountains, and northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The highway serves the Virginia communities of Goochland, Mineral, Culpeper, the town of Washington, and Front Royal and the independent city of Winchester. US 522 then follows the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians north and then east through the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, a stretch of Western Maryland, and South Central Pennsylvania to its terminus in the Susquehanna Valley. The highway serves Berkeley Springs, West Virginia; Hancock, Maryland; and the Pennsylvania communities of McConnellsburg, Mount Union, Lewistown, and Middleburg.

US 522 contains several segments that are part of the National Highway System. The U.S. highway is part of the main system from Virginia State Route 37 (SR 37) near Winchester to Interstate 70 (I-70) at Warfordsburg, Pennsylvania. US 522 is also part of the main system from the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) at Fort Littleton to Pennsylvania Route 35 (PA 35) at Shade Gap and from the south end of its concurrency with US 22 at Mount Union to its northern terminus near Selinsgrove. US 522 is a National Highway System principal arterial in four places in Virginia, including its concurrencies with SR 3 and US 15 Bus. in Culpeper, on its concurrency with US 211 between Sperryville and Massies Corner, from its southern junction with SR 55 to I-66 in Front Royal, and from the south end of its concurrency with US 11 in Winchester to SR 37 near Winchester. The highway is also a principal arterial from PA 35 at Shade Gap to US 22 at Mount Union. US 522&#x27;s other junctions with highways part of the National Highway System along its course through Virginia include I-64 near Gum Spring; US 15 and US 29 in Culpeper; US 340 in Front Royal; and I-81, US 17, US 50, and SR 7 in Winchester. Other major junctions include one with West Virginia Route 9 (WV 9) in Berkeley Springs along its in West Virginia; I-68, I-70, and US 40 in Hancock during its streak across Maryland; and US 30 in McConnellsburg and US 22 and US 322 in Lewistown during its route through Pennsylvania.

===Powhatan to Culpeper===
US 522 begins at a four-legged intersection with US 60 (Anderson Highway) on the western edge of the unincorporated village of Powhatan, the county seat of Powhatan County. The roadway continues on the south side of the intersection as SR 1002 (Emmanuel Church Road), which passes the eponymous church before it connects with SR 13. US 522 heads north as Maidens Road, which heads through the community of Jefferson, the site of the historic home Elmington. North of Michaux, the highway meets the east end of SR 313 (Beaumont Road), which leads to the Beaumont Learning Center, before it crosses the William Walthall Michaux Bridge over the James River into Goochland County. US 522 crosses over CSX&#x27;s James River Subdivision rail line and joins SR 6 (River Road) at Maidens. The two highways meet the east end of SR 329, which leads to the Virginia Correctional Center for Women, opposite the historic home Brightly. US 522 and SR 6 continue through Goochland, where the highways pass the Goochland County Court Square. The highways meet the west end of SR 396 (Dickenson Road), which leads to the Goochland campus of J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, before the two highways diverge at the north end of the county seat.
US 522 continues north on Sandy Hook Road, which passes through the eponymous hamlet before entering Louisa County at the village of Gum Spring. There, the U.S. Highway intersects US 250 (Broad Street Road) and has a diamond interchange with I-64. US 522 continues on Cross County Road, which passes through Shelfar and Orchid and crosses the South Anna River at Southanna. The route continues through Apple Grove to Cuckoo, where the highway joins US 33 (Jefferson Highway) in front of the eponymous historic estate. After a brief concurrency with US 33, US 522 splits north onto Pendleton Road through Pendleton, where the highway parallels CSX&#x27;s Piedmont Subdivision rail line into the town of Mineral, where the route follows Mineral Avenue and passes through its namesake historic district. At the intersection of Mineral Avenue and First Street, US 522 meets SR 208 and SR 22, the latter of which has its eastern terminus at the intersection. SR 208 and SR 22 head north and west on Mineral Avenue toward the county seat of Louisa; US 522 and SR 208 turn east onto First Street, intersect the rail line at grade, and turn north onto Louisa Avenue.

US 522 and SR 208 follow Zachary Taylor Highway away from Mineral. North of Contrary Creek, the two routes diverge at Wares Crossroads. SR 208 splits east onto New Bridge Road toward Spotsylvania Courthouse, and US 522 continues northwest along the presidential-named highway. The U.S. Highway crosses the mainstem of Lake Anna, the North Anna River, to cross the western corner of Spotsylvania County. US 522 crosses Pamunkey Creek as it enters Orange County. After leaving the Lake Anna area, the U.S. Highway heads straight north to Unionville, where the route intersects SR 20 (Constitution Highway). US 522 crosses Mill Run and Mountain Run and follows Raccoon Branch as the route curves northwest and crosses the Rapidan River into Culpeper County. At Winston, US 522 curves northeast and joins Rapidan Road on a tangent and begins to parallel Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Washington District rail line. The U.S. Highway veers away from the rail line, crosses Sumerduck Creek, and expands to a four-lane divided highway as passes the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center and approaches Germanna Highway, which carries SR 3, southeast of Culpeper.

===Culpeper to Front Royal===
US 522 and SR 3 head northwest along four-lane divided Germanna Highway. The highways meet US 15 and US 29 (James Madison Highway) at a diamond interchange and enter the town of Culpeper, where the divided highway narrows to a two-lane road and crosses over the Norfolk Southern rail line. SR 3 has its western terminus at Orange Road, which heads south carrying US 15 Bus.; US 15 Bus. joins US 522 on Germanna Highway west one block to US 29 Bus., where US 522 and US 15 Bus. turn north and join US 29 Bus. on Main Street. The three highways pass by the historic Burgandine House, at Main Street&#x27;s oblique intersection with Orange Road, and to the west of the South East Street Historic District, which contains the Hill Mansion and Culpeper National Cemetery. The U.S. Highway and the two business routes continue through the Culpeper Historic District, where they pass the Pitts Theatre, the A. P. Hill Boyhood Home, and the Lord Culpeper Hotel and pass to the west of the Culpeper railroad station. North of downtown, US 522 diverges from US 15 Bus. and US 29 Bus. when it turns west onto Evans Street, which crosses Mountain Run and passes Fairview Cemetery on its way out of the town of Culpeper.
US 522 heads northwest into the foothills of the Blue Ridge in western Culpeper County as Sperryville Pike. The U.S. highway passes through the hamlets of Norman and Griffinsburg and crosses Devils Run and the Hazel River south of their confluence. US 522 passes through the village of Boston, the site of the historic home Elmwood, before it enters Rappahannock County. The highway crosses Blackwater Creek between Round Hill and Scrabble and follows the stream through the gap between Butler Mountain and Bessie Bell Mountain to Woodville. US 522 crosses White Walnut Run and Beaverdam Creek south of its junction with SR 231 (F.T. Valley Road). The U.S. Highway continues to Sperryville, where the highway passes through the village&#x27;s namesake historic district. US 522 crosses the Thornton River immediately before its junction with US 211 (Lee Highway) east of US 211&#x27;s ascent of the Blue Ridge and access to Shenandoah National Park at Thornton Gap.

US 522 runs concurrently with US 211 northeast along four-lane divided Lee Highway. The routes cross the Piney River near Sperryville and the Covington River at Rediviva. South of the Rappahannock county seat of Washington, US 211 Bus. and unsigned US 522 Bus. split north onto Main Street to serve the county seat directly. The mainline U.S. Highways pass southeast of the town and reconnect with the entirely concurrent business routes, which exit town on Warren Street, next to the Calvert Mill. US 522 and US 211 cross Battle Run just west of Massies Corner, where US 211 continues east toward Warrenton while US 522 heads north on two-lane Zachary Taylor Highway. US 522 passes through Flint Hill, site of the eponymous Baptist church. The highway crosses the Jordan River and three of its tributaries—Wilson Branch, Hittles Mill Stream, and Indian Run—between Flint Hill and Huntly. From Huntly, US 522 ascends the Blue Ridge to Chester Gap, where the highway intersects the Appalachian Trail next to the headwaters of the Rappahannock River and the Rappahannock–Warren–Fauquier county tripoint.

===Front Royal to Winchester===
US 522 enters Warren County and descends to the town of Front Royal along Remount Road, which passes the historic Mountain Home along its descent along Happy Creek. The U.S. Highway expands to a four-lane divided highway and its name changes to Commerce Avenue at SR 55, which heads west along South Street and east as John Marshall Highway. US 522 passes to the east of the Front Royal Historic District. In the northern part of the town, the highway curves west to Commerce Avenue&#x27;s terminus at Royal Avenue, which carries US 340 and SR 55. The three highways follow four-lane Royal Avenue north to a right-angle curve where the three routes curve onto 14th Street and then turn north onto four-lane divided Shenandoah Street. US 522, US 340, and SR 55 cross Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Hagerstown District rail line and the South Fork Shenandoah River into the Riverton area of Front Royal, where SR 55 splits to the west onto Strasburg Road. The two U.S. Highways then cross the North Fork Shenandoah River and Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s B-Line just west of the confluence of the two Shenandoah River forks. US 522 and US 340 cross Crooked Run and have a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-66 as they leave the town of Front Royal.

US 522 and US 340 head north along four-lane divided Winchester Road. The highways pass through Cedarville, the site of the Virginia Inland Port, and through Nineveh, the site of the historic estate Erin. North of Nineveh, the routes follow the Warren–Frederick county line and briefly enter Clarke County, where the road is named Stonewall Jackson Highway. US 522 and US 340 diverge at a four-legged intersection at Double Tollgate. US 340 heads east along Lord Fairfax Highway; the west leg of the junction is SR 277 (Fairfax Pike), which heads toward Stephens City. US 522 continues into Frederick County as Front Royal Pike, which passes through Armel at Wrights Run and Parkins Mills at Opequon Creek. The highway passes to the west of Winchester Regional Airport before reaching Millwood Pike, which carries US 17 and US 50. The north leg of the junction is the ramps to and from northbound I-81. US 522 turns west onto Millwood Pike, and the three U.S. Highways enter the independent city of Winchester within the southbound side of the partial cloverleaf interchange.

US 522, US 17, and US 50 follow four-lane divided Millwood Avenue along the south side of the campus of Shenandoah University. West of Abrams Creek, the four-lane divided highway continues west as Jubal Early Drive; the three U.S. Highways turn northwest onto a two-lane continuation of Millwood Avenue. The routes cross Town Run and have an oblique grade crossing of CSX&#x27;s Shenandoah Subdivision rail line. At Gerrard Street, which carries US 11, all four U.S. Highways turn north onto two-lane Cameron Street. US 522, US 11, US 17, and US 50 head north into the Winchester Historic District. At Cork Street, US 17 reaches its northern terminus and US 50 turns west. US 522 and US 11 continue north along the east edge of the downtown area. North of downtown, US 11 and US 522 diverge when the latter highway turns west onto Commercial Street. US 522 intersects the Winchester and Western Railroad immediately before it turns north onto Fairmount Avenue, which the highway follows out of the city of Winchester and back into Frederick County.

===Winchester to Hancock===

US 522 curves northwest and expands to a four-lane divided highway as North Frederick Pike at it leaves Winchester to a diamond interchange with SR 37 (Winchester Bypass). The highway passes by Albin and Nain, between which the route crosses North Mountain and crosses Babbs Run east of Hunting Ridge. The route crosses Hogue Creek and Back Creek on either side of Gainesboro, where the route briefly parallels the Winchester and Western Railroad. US 522 crosses Isaacs Creek and Little Isaacs Creek on either side of Cross Junction, north of which the highway meets the east end of SR 127 (Bloomery Pike). The highway passes through Reynolds Store, crosses Timber Ridge, and descends into the valley of Sleepy Creek before reaching the Virginia–West Virginia state line near the northernmost point in Virginia.

Just after entering Morgan County, West Virginia, US 522 reduces from a four-lane divided highway to a two-lane undivided road, Valley Road, which follows the east flank of Warm Spring Ridge north. The highway crosses Breakneck Run and passes a fish hatchery at Ridge, passes the entrance to Cacapon Resort State Park at Omps, and crosses Rock Gap Run at Rock Gap. US 522 passes by the headwaters of Warm Spring Run and follows the stream through Berryville to the town of Berkeley Springs, the county seat of Morgan County. The highway enters town on Washington Street and intersects Martinsburg Road, from which the highway runs concurrently through the Town of Bath Historic District with WV 9. In the center of town, US 522 and WV 9 pass by Berkeley Springs State Park and the Morgan County Courthouse. In the northern part of town, WV 9 splits west onto Union Street to cross Warm Spring Ridge, and the U.S. Highway continues north and passes the historic Berkeley Springs Train Depot. US 522 heads north from Berkeley Springs on Hancock Road, which parallels Warm Spring Run and a CSX rail spur through North Berkeley, Jimtown, and Burnt Factory. North of Burnt Factory, the highway descends into the narrow valley of the Potomac River; southbound US 522 has a climbing lane.
US 522&#x27;s bridge across the Potomac River begins just north of River Road; the highway crosses over CSX&#x27;s Cumberland Subdivision&#x27;s Hancock rail yard and, on the bridge itself, has its last junction in West Virginia, with Airport Road, which leads to Potomac Airpark in the West Virginia hamlet of Hancock. The bridge crosses into Washington County, Maryland and the town of Hancock at a narrow channel of the Potomac, crosses an island, then crosses the main channel of the river, Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Berm Road, the Western Maryland Rail Trail, and South Street before the bridge lands on the Maryland side of the river. US 522, named Warfordsburg Road, meets a two-way ramp from Maryland Route 144 (Main Street) before the highway bridges MD 144, Little Tonoloway Creek, and Limestone Road, which is MD 894. US 522 becomes a divided highway just south of its right-in/right-out junction with High Street, which leads to MD 144 via Virginia Avenue. Southbound US 522 has an exit ramp to Limestone Road used to access MD 144. US 522 meets I-70 and US 40 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at a three-level directional-T interchange where US 522 becomes concurrent with the two highways. Immediately to the north, I-70 and US 522 meet the eastern terminus of I-68 (National Freeway) at another three-level directional interchange, where westbound US 40 leaves I-70 and goes onto I-68. Southbound US 522 exits I-70 via a left exit prior to US 40 joining eastbound I-70, so southbound US 522 does not have a concurrency with US 40. I-70 and US 522 continue north as a four-lane freeway that leaves the town of Hancock and crosses the Maryland–Pennsylvania state line.

===Hancock to Mount Union===
US 522 enters Pennsylvania concurrent with I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) in Bethel Township in Fulton County. The Interstate and the U.S. Highway split in Warfordsburg at Exit 168, a diamond interchange where I-70 curves northwest toward Breezewood while US 522 heads north on Great Cove Road. Great Cove Road continues a short distance west of the interchange to PA 484 (Buck Valley Road). US 522 crosses Little Tonoloway Creek at Great Cove and passes through a gap in Tonoloway Ridge on its way to a junction with PA 643 (Flickersville Road) in the hamlet of Dott. The U.S. highway continues northeast around the northern edge of Tonoloway Ridge at the Belfast Township village of Needmore, where the highway has a brief concurrency with PA 655, which heads south as Thompson Road and north as Pleasant Valley Road. US 522 curves to the east, crosses Tonoloway Creek, ascends Timber Ridge, and descends the ridge to cross Licking Creek at Gem. The U.S. highway climbs over Scrub Ridge and curves to the northeast at the village of Big Cove Tannery in Ayr Township, where the highway intersects PA 928 (Big Cove Tannery Road) and crosses Big Cove Creek.
US 522 passes around the northern end of Dickeys Mountain and enters the broad valley of Big Cove Creek between Meadow Grounds Mountain to the west and Tuscarora Mountain to the east. Near the northern end of the valley, the highway passes through the borough of McConnellsburg. US 522 follows Second Street through the county seat, which passes by the Fulton House and through the McConnellsburg Historic District. In the center of the borough, the U.S. Highway intersects Lincoln Way, which heads east as PA 16; Lincoln Way was part of the original Lincoln Highway. US 522 heads north out of the borough into Todd Township, once again named Great Cove Road, and meets US 30 (Lincoln Highway) at a diamond interchange. The highway heads by the headwaters of Cove Creek and through the narrow valley between Little Scrub Ridge to the west and Cove Mountain to the east. At Knobsville, the U.S. Highway follows Licking Creek through a gap in the former mountain into Dublin Township, where the highway intersects PA 475 (Waterfall Road) and meets I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) at Exit 180, the Fort Littleton interchange. US 522 parallels the turnpike through the valley of Little Aughwick Creek northeast through Fort Littleton to the village of Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania just north of Sidneys Knob. Here the U.S. Highway turns north into Huntingdon County.

US 522 heads north as Croghan Pike through Dublin Township on the east side of Shade Mountain. After intersecting PA 35 and PA 641 (Neelyton Road) in the village of Shade Gap, the U.S. Highway follows Shade Creek by the Shade Gap Feed and Flour Mill and through a gap in Shade Mountain into the Locke Valley in Cromwell Township. US 522 follows Shade Creek north, passing by the St. Mary&#x27;s Covered Bridge, to Blacklog, then the highway curves west and follows Blacklog Creek through a gap in Blacklog Mountain. The highway becomes Ridgely Street in the borough of Orbisonia, where the highway intersects PA 994 (Elliot Street). US 522 parallels the East Broad Top Railroad and Aughwick Creek north into Shirley Township. The highway passes through the borough of Shirleysburg, crosses Aughwick Creek and the East Broad Top Railroad, and passes by the village of Aughwick Mills, where the route diverges from the creek. US 522 continues along the railroad to Allenport, where the highway meets the southern end of PA 103. The highway parallels the Juniata River north along the eastern edge of the borough of Mount Union. US 522 passes under Water Street and Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Pittsburgh Line (the former Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad) before crossing the river to an intersection with US 22 (William Penn Highway) in Mifflin County.

===Mount Union to Selinsgrove===

US 522 joins US 22 in a concurrency that heads northeast between Jacks Mountain to the northwest and the Juniata River to the southeast. The two highways follow Long Hollow Creek north through Wayne Township to Atkinson Mills, where the routes cross Beaverdam Run and enter the valley of Musser Run. US 522 and US 22 follow Musser Run into Oliver Township to the borough of McVeytown, north of which the highways briefly follow the Juniata River. The U.S. Highways cross Wakefield Run and cross Strodes Run at Strodes Mills into Granville Township. There, US 522 and US 22 expand to a four-lane freeway, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway. US 22 Bus. splits from the mainline highways at a trumpet interchange, and the two U.S. Highways pass to the north side of Big Ridge opposite the business route. Shortly after entering Derry Township, US 522 and US 22 meet US 322 (28th Division Highway) at a directional-T interchange. The interchange includes partial cloverleaf interchange ramps with Ort Valley Road and the main street of unincorporated Highland Park, Electric Avenue.

US 522, US 22, and US 322 run concurrently south along Kishacoquillas Creek into the borough of Lewistown. East of downtown, US 522 diverges from the other two U.S. Highways, which continue along the freeway southeast toward Harrisburg. Westbound US 22 and US 322 interact with US 522 via a half diamond interchange; access between the southbound U.S. Highways and US 522 is via Logan Street and Walnut Street. Two-lane US 522 crosses Kishacoquillas Creek, leaves Lewistown, and passes the Lewistown Armory. The route continues northeast through Derry Township in the valley of Jacks Creek between Jacks Mountain to the north and Shade Mountain to the south, a valley that has several short ridges itself. US 522 passes the Old Hoopes School north of Maitland. The U.S. Highway continues into Decatur Township, where the route crosses Meadow Creek at Alfarata, Jacks Creek at Soradoville, and Wagner Run at Wagner.

US 522 continues into Snyder County, where the route passes through the valley of Middle Creek. The highway immediately passes through the West Beaver Township borough of McClure, where the highway follows the South Branch of Middle Creek through a gap in a short ridge and follows Beaver Creek from its headwaters. US 522 follows that creek into Spring Township to Beaver Springs, where the U.S. Highway runs concurrently with PA 235. The highway crosses Beaver Township and through the borough of Beavertown, through which the route follows Market Street. US 522 crosses Middle Creek shortly after entering Franklin Township and passes through the county seat of Middleburg along Market Street and Main Street. Part of the route&#x27;s course on Main Street is a concurrency with PA 104, with which the highway crosses Middle Creek a second time. US 522 crosses the creek for the last time in the Middle Creek Township community of Kreamer. The U.S. Highway enters Penn Township and passes through the northern fringe of the borough of Selinsgrove, where the route meets the southern end of PA 204. US 522 leaves Selinsgrove at its intersection with the north end of Market Street. The U.S. Highway veers northeast and crosses Penns Creek on a truss bridge into Monroe Township. US 522 expands to a four-lane divided highway named Susquehanna Trail and passes to the south of Penn Valley Airport before reaching its northern terminus at a partially completed, partial cloverleaf interchange with US 11 and US 15, which head south on the Selinsgrove Bypass and north along Susquehanna Trail, a short distance west of the Susquehanna River.

==History==

US 522 was created in 1926 and signed from Lewistown to Selinsgrove in Pennsylvania. A year later, US 522 was extended south to Hancock, Maryland, along its current alignment. The portion from U.S. Route 40 in Hancock to U.S. Route 22 in Mount Union, Pennsylvania, was previously U.S. Route 622 from 1926 to 1927. The designation, shown on the 1926 U.S. Highway System plan, may not have been signed. 

Through Maryland, Warfordsburg Road from Main Street at the west end of Hancock north to the Pennsylvania state line was paved in 1920. When the first number designations in the U.S. Highway System were released in 1926, US 622 was proposed for the highway between Hancock and Mount Union, Pennsylvania. Another proposed number for the highway may have been US 11W, which appears marked on Warfordsburg Road on official Maryland maps in 1927 and 1928. By 1930, the highway was marked as US 522. The March 1936 flooding of the Potomac River destroyed the pre-existing bridge over the river at Church Street. A temporary timber trestle was constructed while a new bridge was planned at the western edge of the town of Hancock. The new bridge and approach roads were completed in 1939. US 522 was extended south of Hancock by 1946. US 522 was moved from Warfordsburg Road to a concurrency with I-70 when the Interstate highway and the associated directional interchanges were completed in 1965.

==Future==
The West Virginia Division of Highways (WVDOH) has now selected a Preferred Alternative for the US 522 project. In general terms, the route runs parallel to—and east of—the existing Route 522 for approximately from the Maryland state line to the Virginia state line. It will be, for most of its length, within of the current 522. In the vicinity of the proposed Ridge Historic District, however, the alignment extends farther away to avoid impacting either that site or the adjacent fish hatchery. Also, immediately south of Berkeley Springs, the projected route would veer further east to avoid the downtown area.

==Major intersections==


























==Auxiliary routes==
*US 522A was the designation for the unnamed left exit ramp from eastbound I-70 to southbound US 522 within I-70 Exit 1. The ramp is marked as Exit 1B. The designation was retired in 2013 and is now inventoried as part of mainline US 522.
*US 522B is the designation for the unnamed two-way ramp between MD 144 and US 522 at the south end of the bridge over the Potomac River. All movements are allowed at the intersection with MD 144. Left turns are prohibited at the ramp&#x27;s intersection with US 522, so the ramp functions more like a right-in/right-out interchange for southbound US 522. The ramp also provides access to a hotel.
*US 522C is the designation for a section of north–south Virginia Avenue and east–west High Street between MD 144 and a right-in/right-out interchange with northbound US 522.

<doc id="902708" wikidata="Q829500" url="?curid=902708" title="Magerøya">
<text>or is a large island in Finnmark county, in the extreme northern part of Norway. The island lies along the Barents Sea in Nordkapp Municipality, just north of the Porsanger Peninsula. The mouth of Porsangerfjorden lies off the east coast of the island.

Magerøya has an area of and the highest elevation on the island is the mountain Gråkallfjellet. The most northern point on the island is also the northernmost point in Norway outside Svalbard: Knivskjellodden. The island features a bleak, barren, tundra-covered landscape devoid of any trees (except for a few small pockets of mountain birch), with steep cliffs along the coast, and dramatic mountainscapes in the interior. On southern Magerøya, archaeologists have found evidence of settlements dating back 10,000 years.

Due to its location inside the Arctic Circle, the Sun does not set from mid-May to late July and does not rise from mid-November to late January.

==Places on Magerøya==

The main population centre on the island is the town of Honningsvåg. Other smaller settlements include the fishing villages of Gjesvær, Skarsvåg, Nordvågen, and Kamøyvær. North Cape is a very popular tourist attraction on the northern shore of the island.

==Transportation==
Magerøya&#x27;s main claim to fame is the North Cape, a steep cliff cape on the northern coast that is a major tourist attraction. To accommodate the large numbers of tourists that visit the island, a subsea tunnel was built from 1993 to 1999. The North Cape Tunnel is part of the European route E69 highway. It is long and reaches a depth of below sea level. For a time, it was one of the longest and deepest subsea tunnels in the world. Fog or ice may occur inside the tunnel, even in summer.

Norway&#x27;s Hurtigruten ferry service stops at the town of Honningsvåg on Magerøya since the waters around the island remain ice-free all year round due to the warm North Atlantic drift. Honningsvåg Airport is located on the eastern part of the island.

<text>U.S. Route 123 (US 123) is a spur of US 23 in the U.S. states of Georgia and South Carolina. The U.S. Highway runs from US 23, US 441, SR 15 and SR 365 near Clarkesville, Georgia, north and east to Interstate 385 Business (I-385 Business) in Greenville, South Carolina. US 123 parallels I-85 to the north as it connects the Northeast Georgia cities of Clarkesville and Toccoa with the western Upstate South Carolina communities of Westminster, Seneca, Clemson, Easley, and Greenville.

==Route description==
US 123 has a length of in Georgia and in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway runs concurrently with SR 365 for its entire length in Georgia. US 123 is part of the National Highway System from its southern terminus to SR 17 and SR 184 near Toccoa and from US 76 and SC 28 in Clemson to SC 183 in Greenville.
=== Georgia ===

US 123 begins at a partial interchange with US 23, US 441, SR 15 and SR 365 east of Clarkesville. The interchange provides access between US 123 and those highways in the direction of Cornelia, Gainesville, and Atlanta. Access to northbound US 23, US 441, and SR 15 is provided via SR 17 (Toccoa Highway), which US 123 meets at its next intersection and with which the highway begins to run concurrently. US 123 and SR 17 head east along a four-lane divided highway through Chattahoochee National Forest. The highways cross the Habersham–Stephens county line and pass over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Greenville District while passing along the north side of Currahee Mountain. At their intersection with SR 184 (Dicks Hill Parkway), SR 17 continues southeast along the divided highway toward Lavonia while US 123 turns north and joins SR 184 on Curahee Street, which forms the border of the national forest until the highways reach the city limits of Toccoa.

US 123 and SR 184 gain a center turn lane and cross a Norfolk Southern rail line as they approach the downtown area. In the center of town, the highway begins to parallel the Greenville District rail line and intersects Broad Street, which carries SR 63 and SR 106 south of the intersection and SR 184 to the north. US 123 passes the Toccoa Amtrak station and intersects SR 17 Alternate (Big A Road), where the center turn lane ends. The highway passes Toccoa Airport and veers away from the railroad on the eastern edge of the city. US 123 passes by the historic site Travelers Rest before crossing the Tugaloo River branch of Lake Hartwell into Oconee County, South Carolina.
=== South Carolina ===
The highway parallels the left bank of the lake to the mouth of the Chauga River, then curves north and crosses over the Greenville District before entering the town of Westminster, where the highway intersects US 76 (North Avenue).

US 123 and US 76 head east on Windsor Street, meet the western end of SC 183 (Westminster Highway), and temporarily expand to a four-lane divided highway as they pass under the rail line. The U.S. Highways reduce to two lanes to pass through downtown Westminster, which includes the historic Southern Railway Passenger Station. At the east end of downtown, US 123 and US 76 veer onto Main Street, which becomes a four-lane road with center turn lane. The highways meet the northern end of SC 24 (West Oak Highway) in the eastern part of town. The U.S. Highways&#x27; name changes to Sandifer Boulevard as they leave Westminster and expand to a four-lane divided highway. The highways have a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 11 (Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway) and cross to the north side of the railroad, then become a four-lane road with center turn lane as they enter the town of Seneca. US 123 and US 76 intersect SC 28 (Blue Ridge Boulevard) and SC 59 (1st North Street), which head north and south, respectively, from the intersection. US 123, US 76, and SC 28 head east concurrently along the north side of Seneca south of Lake Keowee. The highways have a partial cloverleaf interchange with Pine Street before intersecting SC 130, which heads southwest along 1st North Street and northeast along Rochester Highway.

US 123, US 76, and SC 28 cross the railroad and continue east from Seneca as Clemson Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway. The highways begin to closely parallel the railroad shortly before they meet the western end of SC 93 (Pendleton Road), which provides access to Clemson University. The highways continue as Tiger Boulevard and, after crossing the Keowee River branch of Lake Hartwell into Pickens County, Calhoun Memorial Highway. In the town of Clemson, the three highways intersect SC 133 (College Avenue) before US 76 and SC 28 turn south onto Anderson Highway. US 123 veers away from the railroad and becomes a freeway at its diamond interchange with SC 93 (Old Greenville Highway). The U.S. Highway has diamond interchanges at Issaqueena Trail, at 18 Mile Road on the edge of the town of Central, and at Ruhamah Road (identified as ROAD 17 on directional signs), US 178 (Moorefield Memorial Highway), and Cartee Road around the town of Liberty. US 123 enters the city of Easley and has a partial interchange with US 123 Connector (Ross Avenue), which leads west to SC 93; there is no access from northbound US 123 to the westbound connector route. The freeway ends at the highway&#x27;s diamond interchange with SC 135 (Pendleton Street), which leads to SC 8.

US 123 continues east as a four-lane road with center turn lane to its directional intersection with the eastern end of SC 93 (Greenville Road), where the U.S. Highway becomes a divided highway again and briefly parallels the Greenville District rail line. The highway has a trumpet interchange with SC 153 on the eastern edge of Easley. US 123 has a directional intersection with the western end of SC 124 (Old Easley Highway) at Greenville-Pickens Speedway before the highway crosses the Saluda River into Greenville County. The U.S. Highway continues as New Easley Road along the edge of the Greenville suburb of Parker, then becomes Easley Bridge Road at its diamond interchange with US 25 (White Horse Road). US 123 reduces to a four-lane undivided highway, crosses over CSX&#x27;s Belton Subdivision, and enters the city of Greenville just west of its intersection with SC 124 (Pendleton Street) and becomes Academy Street. The highway has a grade crossing with a Norfolk Southern rail line and crosses over the Reedy River and the Swamp Rabbit Trail (formerly Greenville and Northern Railway) on the western edge of downtown Greenville. US 123 intersects both directions of SC 183—Buncombe Street eastbound and College Street westbound—adjacent to the Greenville County Museum of Art before curving east to intersect Main Street and US 29 (Church Street). The highway then curves south and reaches its northern terminus at I-385 Business (North Street) a short distance west of the northern terminus of I-385 adjacent to the Bon Secours Wellness Arena.

===National Highway System===
The entire length of US 123 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense.

==History==
US 123 replaced all of SC 13 in 1946. SC 13 was SC 17 before 1928.

===South Carolina Highway 13===
====SC 13&#x27;s Greenville alternate route====

South Carolina Highway 13 Alternate (SC 13 Alt.) was an alternate route for the original SC 13 (that was replaced by US 123). It existed in Greenville, South Carolina. It was formed around 1940 from SC 250 (now US 25) to SC 13. Approximately 1950, SC 13 Alt. was decommissioned, and US 123 replaced its path.
==Major intersections==












==Special routes==
===Seneca business loop===

U.S. Route 123 Business (US 123 Bus) was established in 1958 as a renumbering of mainline US 123 through downtown Seneca, via North 1st Street. It was decommissioned in 2000, renumbered as part of SC 59 and SC 130.

===Easley business loop===

U.S. Route 123 Business (US 123 Bus) was established in 1958 as a renumbering of mainline US 123 through downtown Easley, via Liberty Drive and Main Street. It was decommissioned in 1963 when mainline US 123 was rerouted further south along new freeway; the alignment was renumbered as part of SC 93.

===Easley connector route===

U.S. Route 123 Connector (US 123 Conn.) is a connector route in the west-central part of Easley that connects SC 93 (Greenville Highway / Liberty Drive) with US 123 (Calhoun Memorial Highway). The connector route is not signed along SC 93 or US 123, but there is signage along its actual path. The entire length is known as Ross Avenue.

US 123 Conn. and Ross Avenue begin at an intersection with SC 93 mainline and travel to the east. Immediately, they curve to the southeast. They curve back to the east just before reaching their eastern terminus, an intersection with US 123.

===Greenville alternate route===

<doc id="902715" wikidata="Q552264" url="?curid=902715" title="Hand transplantation">
<text>Hand transplantation, or simply a hand transplant, is a surgical procedure to transplant a hand from one human to another. The donor hand, usually from a brain-dead donor, is transplanted to a recipient amputee. Most hand transplants to date have been performed on below-elbow amputees, although above-elbow transplants are gaining popularity. Hand transplants were the first of a new category of transplants where multiple organs are transplanted as a single functional unit, now termed vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA).

The operation is quite extensive and typically lasts from 8 to 12 hours. In comparison, a typical heart transplant operation lasts 6 to 8 hours. Surgeons usually connect the bones first, followed by tendons, arteries, nerves, veins, and skin.

== Use of immunosuppressive drugs afterward ==
For a hand transplant to succeed the recipient is required to take immunosuppressive drugs, as in other organ transplants such as kidney or liver, to minimize rejection, or risk destruction of the hand by the recipient&#x27;s natural immune system. These drugs risk weakening the recipient&#x27;s immune system, which may increase the risk of infections and some cancers. Many recent advances in solid organ transplantation have made these medications more tolerable.

A period of extensive hand therapy/rehabilitation after transplantation helps the recipient gain function of the transplanted hand. Compliance with immunosuppressive medications and intensive physical therapy after hand transplants is associated with significant success in regaining the function of the new hands/arms.

==History==

A hand transplant was performed in Ecuador in 1964, but the patient experienced transplant rejection after only two weeks due to the primitive nature of the immune-suppressing medications at that time.

=== September 23, 1998 hand transplant ===
The first short-term success in human hand transplant surgery occurred with Clint Hallam, from New Zealand. Hallam lost his hand in an accident while in prison. The operation was performed on September 23, 1998, in Lyon, France, by a team assembled from different countries around the world led by French Professor Jean-Michel Dubernard, including Professor Nadey Hakim, from the UK.

A microsurgeon on the team, Earl Owen from Australia, was privy to the detailed basic research, much of it unpublished, that had been carefully gathered by the team in Louisville. After the operation, Hallam wasn&#x27;t comfortable with the idea of his transplanted hand and failed to follow the prescribed post-operative drug and physiotherapy regime. His inaccurate expectations became a vivid example of the necessity of a fully committed team of caregivers, including psychologists, who can correctly select and prepare the potential transplant recipients for the lengthy and difficult recovery and for the modest functional restoration of a transplanted hand to be expected.

Hallam&#x27;s transplanted hand was removed at his request by the transplant surgeon Nadey Hakim on February 2, 2001, following another episode of rejection that was, at least in part, caused by his stopping the anti-rejection medication.

=== Other hand transplantation surgeries===
The first hand transplant to achieve prolonged success was directed by a team of Kleinert Kutz Hand Care surgeons including Warren C. Breidenbach, Tsu-Min Tsai, Luis Scheker, Steven McCabe, Amitava Gupta, Russell Shatford, William O&#x27;Neill, Martin Favetto and Michael Moskal in cooperation with the Christine M. Kleinert Institute, Jewish Hospital and the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. The procedure was performed on New Jersey native Matthew Scott on January 14, 1999. Scott had lost his hand in a fireworks accident at age 24. Later in 1999, the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team asked him to do the honors of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. The Louisville group went on to perform the first five hand transplants in the United States and have performed 12 hand transplants in ten recipients as of 2016.

In contrast to the earlier attempts at hand transplantation, the Louisville group had performed extensive basic science research and feasibility studies for many years before their first clinical procedure (for example, Shirbacheh &quot;et al.&quot;, 1998). There was also considerable transparency and institutional review board oversight involved in the screening and selection of prospective patients.

In March 2000, a team of surgeons at the University of Innsbruck in Austria began a series of three bilateral hand transplants over six years. The first was an Austrian police officer who had lost both hands attempting to defuse a bomb. He has completed an around-the-world solo motorcycle trip using his transplanted hands.

University of Louisville doctors also performed a successful hand transplant on Michigan native Jerry Fisher in February 2001, and Michigan resident David Savage in 2006.

On 14 January 2004, the team of Professor Jean-Michel Dubernard (Edouard-Herriot Hospital, France) declared a five-year-old double hand transplant a success. The lessons learned in this case, and in the 26 other hand transplants (6 double) which occurred between 2000 and 2005, encouraged other transplant operations of such organs as the face, abdominal wall, and larynx.

On 4 May 2009 Jeff Kepner, a 57-year-old Augusta, Georgia resident underwent the first double hand transplant in the United States at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center by a team led by W.P. Andrew Lee, who also had been performing careful basic research on such transplants for many years. A CNN story on his follow up demonstrated the limited functional restoration to be expected, particularly following bilateral transplantation.

On 18 February 2010, the first female in the United States underwent hand transplantation at Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. The procedure was performed by surgeons from The Hand Center of San Antonio and US Air Force.

On 22 June 2010, a Polish soldier received two new hands from a female donor, after losing them three years earlier while saving a young recruit from a bomb.

On 8 March 2011, 26-year-old Emily Fennell underwent an 18-hour surgery to attach a right hand. This was performed in the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

On 12 March 2011 Linda Lu became the recipient of a hand transplant, performed at Emory University Hospital, from a donor Leslie Sullivent.

In the fall of 2011, 28-year-old Lindsay Ess received a double hand transplant at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in an 11 1/2 hour surgery.

On 27 December 2012, 51-year-old Mark Cahill received a right hand transplant at Leeds General Infirmary in the UK. The recipient&#x27;s hand was removed during the same 8 hour operation, reportedly allowing very accurate restoration of nerve structures, believed to be an international first.

On 27 February 2013, 38-year-old Eskandar Moghaddami received hand transplant surgery by the 15th of Khordad Hospital plastic surgery team in Tehran, Iran.

On 13 January 2015, doctors at the Kochi-based Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre (AIMS) successfully conducted India&#x27;s first hand transplant. A 30-year-old man, who had lost both his hands in a train accident, received the hands of a 24-year-old accident victim.

On 28 July 2015, doctors at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia performed the first successful bilateral hand transplant on a child. At the age of 2, Zion Harvey lost his hands and feet to a life-threatening infection. Six years later, at age 8, he had both of his hands replaced in a double hand transplant.

On 2 August 2016, the reconstructive transplantation team at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, performed the first intergender hand transplantation in India on a 16-year-old boy who had lost both his hands in an electrocution injury. The donor was a 54-year-old lady who was brain dead following a road traffic accident.

On 26 October 2016, the Director of hand transplantation at UCLA, Dr. Kodi Azari, and his team, performed a hand transplant on 51-year-old entertainment executive from Los Angeles, Jonathan Koch at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Koch underwent a 17-hour procedure to replace his left hand, which he lost to a mysterious, life-threatening illness that struck him in January 2015. On June 23, 2015, Koch had the amputation surgery, also performed by Dr. Kodi Azari, which was designed to prep him to receive a transplanted limb. This included severing the left hand closer to the wrist than the elbow. Azari kept all the nerves and tendons long and extended, which would give him plenty to work with later. Then he sutured them together and attached them to the stump of bone to keep them from retracting. This is the first known hand transplant case in which the hand was amputated in preparation for a hand transplant, as opposed to previous hand transplant patients who have undergone typical amputation surgeries. Azari&#x27;s theory about prepping the hand for a transplant during the initial amputation surgery would later be supported by Koch when he was able to move his thumb only two hours after he woke up from the 17-hour transplant surgery and move his entire hand only two days after surgery.

On 15 January 2021, Icelander Guðmundur Felix Grétarsson underwent the first double-arm and double-shoulder transplant from doctors in France. The transplant was deemed successful.

== Long-term functionality ==
The long-term functionality varies patient to patient and is affected by several factors including level of amputation and transplant and participation in occupational therapy post hand transplant surgery. Hand transplant recipient Jonathan Koch was able to pick up a napkin and a tennis ball with his newly transplanted hand 7 days after his 17-hour surgery and by day 9, he was able to pick up a bottle of water and take a drink. 3 months after surgery, Koch was able to use his transplanted hand to tie his shoe.

==Survival rates==

Although the one-year survival rate of transplanted hands has been excellent at institutions that are fully committed to the procedure, the number of hand transplants performed after 2008 has been small due to drug-related side effects, uncertain long-term outcome, and the high costs of surgery, rehabilitation and immunosuppression.

==Programs==

===United States===
The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Hand and Arm Transplant Program was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board in July 2011. This is one of only two programs in the United States approved to perform hand/arm transplants using an immunomodulatory protocol, which enables patients to take one drug (instead of three) after the transplant to maintain the hand or arm. The program is funded by the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM) to transplant up to six Wounded Warriors or civilians who have a hand or arm amputation on one or both sides.

The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Hand Transplant Program is located in Springfield, Illinois. The program was officially launched in January 2014 after receiving IRB approval and grant funding to transplant five patients, unilateral or bilateral, at minimal cost to the patients.

The UCLA Hand Transplant Program, located in Los Angeles, California, was launched July 28, 2010. At the time, it was the only one on the West Coast and one of only four in the country.

===United Kingdom===
In 2016, it was announced that NHS patients in England were to become some of the first in the world to benefit from publicly funded pioneering hand and upper arm transplants delivered by a specialist team at Leeds General Infirmary.

<text>The .223 Remington (designated 223 Remington by SAAMI and 223 Rem. by the C.I.P., pronounced &quot;two-twenty three&quot;) is a rimless, bottlenecked, centerfire intermediate cartridge. It was developed in 1957 by Remington Arms and Fairchild Industries for the U.S. Continental Army Command of the United States Army as part of a project to create a small-caliber, high-velocity firearm. The .223 Remington is considered one of the most popular common-use cartridges and is used by a wide range of semi-automatic and manual-action rifles.

==History==

&lt;section begin=.223 Remington History /&gt;
The development of the cartridge, which eventually became the .223 Remington, was linked to the development of a new lightweight combat rifle. The cartridge and rifle were developed by Fairchild Industries, Remington Arms, and several engineers working toward a goal developed by U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC). Development began in 1957. A project to create a small-caliber, high-velocity (SCHV) firearm was created. Eugene Stoner of ArmaLite was also invited to scale down the AR-10 (7.62×51mm NATO) design. Winchester was also invited to participate.

CONARC ordered rifles to test. Stoner and Sierra Bullet&#x27;s Frank Snow began work on the .222 Remington cartridge. Using a ballistic calculator, they determined that a 55-grain bullet would have to be fired at 3,300 ft/s to achieve the 500-yard performance necessary.

Robert Hutton (technical editor of &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; magazine) started the development of a powder load to reach the 3,300 ft/s goal. He used DuPont IMR4198, IMR3031, and an Olin powder to work up loads. Testing was done with a Remington 722 rifle with a 22&quot; Apex barrel. During a public demonstration, the round successfully penetrated the US steel helmet as required, but testing also showed chamber pressures to be too high.

Stoner contacted both Winchester and Remington about increasing the case capacity. Remington created a larger cartridge called the .222 Special. This cartridge is loaded with DuPont IMR4475 powder.
During parallel testing of the T44E4 (future M14) and the ArmaLite AR-15 in 1958, the T44E4 experienced 16 failures per 1,000 rounds fired compared to 6.1 for the ArmaLite AR-15. Because of several different .222 caliber cartridges that were being developed for the SCHV project, the .222 Special was renamed .223 Remington. In May 1959, a report was produced stating that five- to seven-man squads armed with ArmaLite AR-15 rifles have a higher hit probability than 11-man squads armed with the M-14 rifle. At an Independence Day picnic, Air Force General Curtis Le May tested the ArmaLite AR-15 and was very impressed with it. He ordered a number of them to replace M2 carbines that were in use by the Air Force. In November of that year, testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground showed the ArmaLite AR-15 failure rate had declined to 2.5/1,000, resulting in the ArmaLite AR-15 being approved for more extensive trials.

In 1961, marksmanship testing compared the AR-15 and M-14; 43% of ArmaLite AR-15 shooters achieved Expert, while only 22% of M-14 rifle shooters did. Le May ordered 80,000 rifles. In July 1962, operational testing ended with a recommendation for the adoption of the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle chambered in .223 Remington. In September 1963, the .223 Remington cartridge was officially accepted and named &quot;Cartridge, 5.56 mm ball, M193&quot;. The following year, the ArmaLite AR-15 was adopted by the United States Army as the M16 rifle, and it would later become the standard U.S. military rifle. The specification included a Remington-designed bullet and the use of IMR4475 powder, which resulted in a muzzle velocity of 3,250 ft/s and a chamber pressure of 52,000 psi.

In the spring of 1962, Remington submitted the specifications of the .223 Remington to the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI). In December 1963, Remington introduced its first rifle chambered for .223 Remington a Model 760 rifle.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The .223 Remington has a 1.87 mL (28.8 gr H2O) cartridge case capacity.

.223 Remington maximum CIP cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 = 23 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 305 mm (1 in 12 in), 6 grooves, Ø lands = , Ø grooves = , land width = and the primer type is small rifle.

According to the official CIP rulings, the .223 Remington can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In CIP-regulated countries, every rifle cartridge combination has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum CIP pressure to certify for sale to consumers.
This means that .223 Remington chambered arms in CIP-regulated countries are proof tested at PE piezo pressure. This is equal to the NATO maximum service pressure guideline for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge.

The SAAMI pressure limit for the .223 Remington is set at , piezo pressure. Remington submitted .223 Remington specifications to SAAMI in 1964.

==.223 Remington vs. 5.56×45mm NATO==
In 1980, the .223 Remington was transformed into a new cartridge and designated 5.56×45mm NATO (SS109 or M855).

===Dimensions===
The external dimensional specifications of .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO brass cases are nearly identical. The cases tend to have similar case capacity when measured (case capacities have been observed to vary by as much as 2.6 grains (0.17 ml)), although the shoulder profile and neck length are not the same and 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge cases tend be slightly thicker to accommodate higher chamber pressures. When hand-loaded, care is taken to look for pressure signs as 5.56×45mm NATO cases may produce higher pressures with the same type of powder and bullet as compared to .223 Remington cases. Sierra provides separate loading sections for .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO and also recommends different loads for bolt-action rifles as compared to semiautomatic rifles.

===Pressures===
Remington submitted the specifications for the .223 Remington cartridge in 1964 to SAAMI. The original pressure for the .223 Remington was 52,000 psi with DuPont IMR Powder. A higher pressure of resulted from the change from IMR to Olin Ball powder. The official name for .223 Remington in the US Army is cartridge 5.56x45mm ball, M193. If a 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge is loaded into a chamber intended to use .223 Remington, the bullet will be in contact with the rifling and the forcing cone is very tight. This generates a much higher pressure than .223 Remington chambers are designed for. NATO chose a 178-mm (1-in-7) rifling twist rate for the 5.56×45mm NATO chambering. The SS109/M855 5.56×45mm NATO ball cartridge requires a 228 mm (1-in-9) twist rate, while adequately stabilizing the longer NATO L110/M856 5.56×45mm NATO tracer projectile requires an even faster 178 mm (1-in-7) twist rate.

===Chambers===
The .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO barrel chamberings are not the same. While the cartridges are identical other than powder load, bullet weight, and chamber pressure, a significant difference is in the barrel of the rifle to be used, not in the cartridge. The 5.56×45mm NATO chambers are dimensionally larger in certain critical areas than .223 Remington chambers. As the chambers differ accordingly the head space gauges used for the two chamberings differ.

By observation, 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition is not as accurate as .223 Remington in many of the AR-type rifles extant, even with the same bullet weight. The .223 Wylde chamber specification developed by Bill Wylde solves this problem by using the external dimensions and lead angle as found in the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.224 inch freebore diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI .223 Remington cartridge. It was designed to increase the accuracy of 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition to that of .223 Remington. Other companies also have chamber designs that increase 5.56×45mm NATO accuracy.

===Comparisons===

The table contains some estimated pressures based on normal proofing practice and on the known increases in pressure caused by bullet setback (which is a similar occurrence with regard to pressure). The proof pressure of M197 is 70,000 psi.

The following table shows the differences in nomenclature, rifling, throating, and normal, maximum, and safe pressures:


==Effects of barrel length on velocity==
Barrel length helps determine a specific cartridge&#x27;s muzzle velocity. A longer barrel typically yields a greater muzzle velocity, while a shorter barrel yields a lower one. The first AR-15 rifles used a barrel length of 20&quot;. In the case of the 223 Remington (M193), ammunition loses or gains about 25.7 ft/sec (7.8 m/s) for each inch of barrel length, while 5.56×45 mm NATO (M855) loses or gains 30.3 ft/sec (9.2 m/s) per inch of barrel length.

==Usage and commercial offerings==

The .223 Remington has become one of the most popular cartridges and is currently used in a wide range of semiautomatic and manual-action rifles and even handguns, such as the Colt AR-15, Ruger Mini-14, Remington Model 700. The popularity of .223 Remington is so great, that in the US it virtually eliminated all other similar .22 caliber center-fire varmint rifle cartridges.

It is commercially loaded with 0.224-inch (5.7 mm) diameter jacketed bullets, with weights ranging from 35 to 85 grains (2.27 to 5.8 g), with the most common loading by far being 55 gr (3.6 g). Ninety-grain and 95-grain (6.2 g) Sierra Matchking bullets are available for reloaders.

<doc id="902718" wikidata="Q3575943" url="?curid=902718" title="Redline">
<text>The redline is the maximum engine speed at which an internal combustion engine or traction motor and its components are designed to operate without causing damage to the components themselves or other parts of the engine. The redline of an engine depends on various factors such as stroke, mass of the components, displacement, composition of components, and balance of components. 

Redlining is riding or driving an automotive vehicle above the redline. The actual term &quot;redline&quot; comes from the red bars that are displayed on tachometers in cars starting at the rpm that denotes the redline for the specific engine. Straying into this area usually does not mean instant engine failure, but may increase the chances of damaging the engine.

==Variation of redline==
The acceleration, or rate of change in piston velocity, is the limiting factor. The piston acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the G-forces experienced by the piston-connecting rod assembly. As long as the G-forces acting on the piston-connecting rod assembly multiplied by their own mass is less than the compressive and tensile strengths of the materials they are constructed from and as long as it does not exceed the bearing load limits, the engine can safely turn without succumbing to physical or structural failure.

Redlines vary anywhere from a few hundred revolutions per minute (rpm) (in very large engines such as those in trains and generators) to more than 10,000 rpm (in smaller, usually high-performance engines such as motorcycles, some sports cars, and pistonless rotary engines). Diesel engines normally have lower redlines than comparably sized gasoline engines, largely because of fuel-atomization limitations; even a small diesel engine, such as a Yanmar 2GM20 found on a sailboat, has a redline of 3400 RPM continuous, with a maximum 1-hour rating of 3600 RPM. Gasoline automobile engines typically will have a redline at between 6000 to 7000 rpm. The Gordon Murray Automotive T.50 has the highest redline of a piston-engine road car rated at 12,100 rpm. The Renesis in the Mazda RX-8 has the highest redline of a production wankel rotary-engine road car rated at 9000 rpm.

In contrast, some older OHV (pushrod) engines had redlines as low as 4800 rpm, mostly due to the engines being designed and built for low-end power and economy during the late 1960s all the way to the early 1990s. One main reason OHV engines have lower redlines is valve float. At high speeds, the valve spring simply cannot keep the tappet or roller on the camshaft. After the valve opens, the valve spring does not have enough force to push the mass of the rocker arm, pushrod, and lifter down on the cam before the next combustion cycle. Flathead engines can have even lower redlines; for example, the Universal Atomic 4, commonly used as auxiliary power on sailboats from the 1950s to the 1980s, has a redline of just 3500 RPM. Overhead cam engines eliminate many of the components and moving mass, used on OHV engines. Lower redlines, however, do not necessarily mean lower performance. 

Motorcycle engines can have even higher redlines because of their comparatively lower reciprocating mass. For example, the 1986–1996 Honda CBR250RR has a redline of about 19,000 rpm. Higher yet have been the redlines of some Formula One cars, with engine speeds reaching over 20,000 rpm on the Cosworth and Renault 2.4-liter V8 engines during the 2006 season.

==Rev-limiter and implementation==
Most modern cars have computer systems that prevent the engine from straying too far into the redline by cutting fuel flow through the fuel injectors/fuel rail (in a direct-injected engine)/carburetor or by disabling the ignition system until the engine drops to a safer operating speed. This device is known as a rev-limiter and is usually set to an RPM value at redline or a few hundred RPM above. Most Electronic Control Units (ECUs) of automatic transmission cars will upshift before the engine hits the redline even with maximum acceleration (The ECU in a sports car&#x27;s automatic transmission will allow the engine to go nearer the redline or hit the redline before upshifting). If manual override is used, the engine may go past redline for a brief amount of time before the ECU will cut power to pull it back or auto-upshift. When the car is in top gear and the engine is in redline (due to high speed), the ECU will cut fuel to the engine, forcing it to decelerate until the engine begins operating &quot;below&quot; the redline at which point it will release fuel back to the engine, allowing it to operate once again.

However, even with these electronic protection systems, a car is not prevented from redlining through inadvertent gear engagement. If a driver accidentally selects a lower gear when trying to shift up or selects a lower gear than intended while shifting down (as in a motorbike sequential manual transmission), the engine will be forced to rapidly rev-up to match the speed of the drivetrain. If this happens while the engine is at high RPMs, it may dramatically exceed the redline. For example, if the operator is driving close to redline in 3rd gear and attempts to shift to 4th gear but unintentionally puts the car in 2nd by mistake, the transmission will be spinning much faster than the engine, and when the clutch is released the engine&#x27;s rpm will increase rapidly. It will lead to a rough and very noticeable engine braking, and likely cause engine damage. This is often known as a &quot;money shift&quot; because of the likelihood of engine damage and the expense of fixing the engine.

Redlining in a diesel engine can be caused by the engine receiving fuel from an unintended source, such as flammable vapour in the intake air, or a broken oil seal in a turbocharger. This is known as diesel engine runaway, and can be stopped by blocking the air intake, or opening the decompression valve.

<text>Francis Otto Matthiessen (February 19, 1902 – April 1, 1950) was an educator, scholar, and literary critic, influential in the fields of American literature and American studies. His best known work, &quot;American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman&quot;, celebrated the achievements of several 19th-century American authors and had a profound impact on a generation of scholars. It also established American Renaissance as the common term to refer to American literature of the mid-19th century. Matthiessen was known for his support of liberal causes and progressive politics. His contributions to the Harvard University community have been memorialized in several ways, including an endowed visiting professorship.

==Early life and education==
Francis Otto Matthiessen was born in Pasadena, California on February 19, 1902. He was the fourth of four children born to Frederick William Matthiessen (1868–1948) and Lucy Orne Pratt (1866). His grandfather, Frederick William Matthiessen, was an industrial leader in zinc production and a successful manufacturer of clocks and machine tools; and also served as mayor of LaSalle, Illinois for 10 years. Francis&#x27;s three older siblings were Frederick William (born 1894), George Dwight (born 1897), and Lucy Orne (born 1898).

In Pasadena, Francis attended the Polytechnic School. After his parents separated, he relocated with his mother to his paternal grandparents&#x27; home in LaSalle. He completed his secondary education at Hackley School, in Tarrytown, New York.

In 1923, he graduated from Yale University, where he was managing editor of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, editor of the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot;, and a member of Skull and Bones. As the recipient of the university&#x27;s DeForest Prize, he entitled his oration, &quot;Servants of the Devil,&quot; in which he denounced Yale&#x27;s administration as an &quot;autocracy, ruled by a Corporation out of touch with college life and allied with big business.&quot; In his final year as a Yale undergraduate, he received the Alpheus Henry Snow Prize, awarded to the senior &quot;who, through the combination of intellectual achievement, character, and personality, shall be adjudged by the faculty to have done the most for Yale by inspiring in classmates an admiration and love for the best traditions of high scholarship.&quot;

As a Rhodes Scholar, he studied at Oxford University, earning a B.Litt. in 1925. Afterward, he quickly completed an M.A. in 1926 and Ph.D. in 1927 at Harvard University. He then taught at Yale for two years before beginning a distinguished teaching career at Harvard.

==Scholarly work==
Matthiessen was an American studies scholar and literary critic at Harvard University and chaired its undergraduate program in history and literature. He wrote and edited landmark works of scholarship on T. S. Eliot, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the James family (Alice James, Henry James, Henry James Sr., and William James), Sarah Orne Jewett, Sinclair Lewis, Herman Melville, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman. His best-known book, &quot;American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman&quot; (1941), discusses the flowering of literary culture in the middle of the American 19th century, with Emerson, Thoreau, Melville, Whitman and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Its focus was the period roughly from 1850 to 1855, in which all these writers, except Emerson, published what would, by Matthiessen&#x27;s time, be considered their masterpieces: Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, multiple editions of Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;, and Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;. The mid-19th century in American literature is commonly called the American Renaissance because of the influence of this work on later literary history and criticism. In 2003 the &quot;New York Times&quot; said that the book &quot;virtually created the field of American literature.&quot; Originally Matthiessen planned to include Edgar Allan Poe in the book, but found that Poe did not fit in the scheme of the book. He wrote the chapter on Poe for the &quot;Literary History of the United States&quot; (&quot;LHUS&quot;, 1948), but &quot;some of the editors missed the usual Matthiessen touch of brilliance and subtlety.&quot; Kermit Vanderbilt suggests that because Matthiessen was &quot;not able to pull together the related strands&quot; between Poe and the writers of &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, the chapter is &quot;markedly old-fashioned.&quot; Matthiessen edited &quot;The Oxford Book of American Verse&quot;, published in 1950, an anthology of American poetry of major importance which contributed significantly to the propagation of American modernist poetry in the 1950s and 1960s.

Matthiessen was one of earliest scholars associated with the Salzburg Global Seminar. In July 1947, he gave the inaugural lecture, stating:
Our age has had no escape from an awareness of history. Much of that history has been hard and full of suffering. But now we have the luxury of an historical awareness of another sort, of an occasion not of anxiety but of promise. We may speak without exaggeration of this occasion as historic, since we have come here to enact anew the chief function of culture and humanism, to bring man again into communication with man. 
Along with John Crowe Ransom and Lionel Trilling, in 1948, Matthiessen was one of the founders of the Kenyon School of English.

==Politics==
Matthiessen&#x27;s politics were left-wing and socialist. Already financially secure, he donated an inheritance he received in the late 1940s to his friend, Marxist economist Paul Sweezy. Sweezy used the money, totaling almost $15,000, to found a new journal, which became the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;. On the Harvard campus, Matthiessen was a visible and active supporter of progressive causes. In May 1940, he was elected president of the Harvard Teachers Union, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor. &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; reported his inaugural address, in which Matthiessen quoted the campus union&#x27;s constitution: &quot;In affiliating with the organized labor movement, we express our desire to contribute to and receive support from this powerful progressive force; to reduce the segregation of teachers from the rest of the workers ...and increase thereby the sense of common purpose among them; and in particular to cooperate in this field in the advancement of education and resistance to all reaction.&quot;

Matthiessen seconded the nomination of the Progressive Party presidential candidate, Henry Wallace, at the party&#x27;s convention in Philadelphia in 1948. Reflective of the emerging McCarthyism surveillance of left-wing university academics, he was mentioned as an activist in Boston area so-called &quot;Communist front groups&quot; by Herbert Philbrick.

==Personal life==
Matthiessen was known to his friends as &quot;Matty.&quot; As a gay man in the 1930s and 1940s, he chose to remain in the closet throughout his professional career, if not in his personal life, although traces of homoerotic concern are apparent in his writings. In 2009, a statement from Harvard University said that Matthiessen &quot;stands out as an unusual example of a gay man who lived his sexuality as an &#x27;open secret&#x27; in the mid-20th century.&quot;

He had a two-decade-long romantic relationship with the painter Russell Cheney, 20 years his senior. Like Matthiessen, the painter came from a family prominent in business, the Cheneys being among America&#x27;s leading silk producers. In a 1925 letter to Cheney, Matthiessen wrote about trusting friends with the knowledge of their relationship, rather than the world at large; in planning to spend his life with Cheney, Matthiessen went as far as asking his cohort in the Yale secret society Skull and Bones to approve of their partnership. With Cheney having encouraged Matthiessen&#x27;s interest in Whitman, it has been argued that &quot;American Renaissance&quot; was &quot;the ultimate expression of Matthiessen&#x27;s love for Cheney and a secret celebration of the gay artist.&quot; Throughout his teaching career at Harvard, Matthiessen maintained a residence in either Cambridge or Boston, but the couple often retreated to their shared cottage in Kittery, Maine. Russell Cheney died in July 1945.

A compilation of letters between Matthiessen and Cheney was published in 1978 under the title &quot;Rat &amp; the Devil: journal letters of F. O. Matthiessen and Russell Cheney&quot;. The title alludes to the pseudonyms by which the two refer to one another: Matthiessen is &quot;Devil&quot; and Cheney is &quot;Rat.&quot; In 1992 the collection was adapted as a stage play, titled &quot;Devil &amp; Rat in Love&quot;, written and directed by Michael Bonacci. The play was also a tribute to Bonacci&#x27;s partner, who had died the previous year.

==Death==
Matthiessen committed suicide in 1950 by jumping from a 12th-floor window of the Hotel Manger in Boston. He had been hospitalized once for a nervous breakdown in 1938–39. He was also deeply affected by Russell Cheney&#x27;s death from a heart attack, in 1945. Matthiessen spent the evening before his own death at the home of his friend and colleague, Kenneth Murdock, Harvard&#x27;s Higginson Professor of English Literature.

In a note left in the hotel room, Matthiessen wrote, &quot;I am depressed over world conditions. I am a Christian and a Socialist. I am against any order which interferes with that objective.&quot; Commentators have speculated on the impact of the escalating Red Scare on his state of mind. He was being targeted by anti-communist forces that would soon be exploited by Senator Joseph McCarthy, and inquiries by the House Un-American Activities Committee into his politics may have been a contributing factor in his suicide. In an article subsection titled &quot;Dupes and Fellow Travelers Dress Up Communist Fronts&quot; in the April 4, 1949 edition of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, he had been pictured among fifty prominent academics, scientists, clergy and writers, who also included Albert Einstein, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman, Langston Hughes, Norman Mailer and fellow Harvard professors Kirtley Mather, Corliss Lamont, and Ralph Barton Perry. In 1958, Eric Jacobsen wrote that Matthiessen&#x27;s death had been &quot;hastened by forces whose activities earned for themselves the sobriquet un-American., which they sought so assiduously to fasten on others.&quot; But, in 1978, Harry Levin was more skeptical, saying only that &quot;spokesmen for the Communist Party, to which he had never belonged, loudly signalized his suicide as a political gesture.&quot;

Matthiessen was buried at Springfield Cemetery in Springfield, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
Matthiessen&#x27;s contribution to the critical celebration of 19th-century American literature is considered formative and enduring. Along with several other scholars, he is regarded as a contributor to the creation of American studies as a recognized academic discipline. His personal story, academic contributions, political activism, and early death had a lasting impact on a circle of scholars and writers. Their sense of loss and struggle to understand his suicide can be found in two novels with central figures inspired by Matthiessen, May Sarton&#x27;s &quot;Faithful are the Wounds&quot; (1955) and Mark Merlis&#x27;s &quot;American Studies&quot; (1994). 

His stature and legacy as a member of the Harvard community has been memorialized in several ways by the university. He was the first Senior Tutor at Eliot House, one of Harvard College&#x27;s undergraduate residential houses. More than 70 years after his death, Matthiessen&#x27;s suite at Eliot House remains preserved as the &quot;F. O. Matthiessen Room&quot;, housing personal manuscripts and 1,700 volumes of his library available for scholarly research by permission. Eliot House also hosts an annual Matthiessen Dinner with a guest speaker.

In 2009, Harvard established an endowed chair in LGBT studies called the F. O. Matthiessen Visiting Professorship of Gender and Sexuality. Harvard President Drew Faust called it &quot;an important milestone&quot; and &quot;the first professorship of its kind in the country.&quot; It is funded by a $1.5 million gift from the members and supporters of the Harvard Gender and Sexuality Caucus.

Holders of the chair have included:

*2013: Henry D. Abelove
*2014: Gayle Rubin
*2016: Robert Reid-Pharr
* 2018: Omise&#x27;eke Natasha Tinsley
*2020: Mel Y. Chen
*2023: C. Riley Snorton

Several generations after Matthiessen&#x27;s death, this visiting professorship reaffirms the university&#x27;s appreciation for his continuing legacy as a storied scholar and teacher.

<text>U.S. Route 224 (US 224) is a spur of US 24 that runs through the states of Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. It currently runs for from US 24 in Huntington, Indiana, east to US 422 Business (US 422 Bus.) and Pennsylvania Route 18 (PA 18) in New Castle, Pennsylvania. It goes through the cities of Canfield, Ohio, Akron, Ohio, and Findlay, Ohio. In Northeast Ohio, US 224 is located a short distance north of the Western Reserve&#x27;s southern boundary.

==Route description==

===Indiana===

From the western terminus at US 24, US 224 heads southeast concurrent with State Road 5 (SR 5). US 224 and SR 5 heads through downtown Huntington as one-way streets, with eastbound on Cherry Street and State Street and westbound on Warren Street. From downtown US 224 and SR 5 head southeast then outside of downtown SR 5 heads due south and US 224 heads east. US 224 passes through Markle where US 224 has an interchange with Interstate 69 (I-69) and intersections with both SR 116 and SR 3. US 224 heads east towards Decatur passing through intersections with SR 301 and SR 1. In Decatur US 224 has a short concurrency with US 27 and US 33. US 224 heads east from Decatur towards Ohio passing through a short concurrency with SR 101.

The only section of U.S. Route 224 in Indiana that is included in the National Highway System is the part concurrent with US 27 and US 33. Traffic reports from the Indiana Department of Transportation in 2010 showed that the lowest traffic levels were the 2,420 vehicles and 670 commercial vehicles using the highway daily near the Ohio state line; the highest traffic levels were the 21,680 vehicles and 1,690 commercial vehicles traveling along the section of US 224 that is concurrent with US 27 and US 33.

===Ohio===

West of its concurrency with US 42 near Lodi, US 224 is a rural arterial highway, mostly two lanes, across western Ohio. It runs roughly parallel to the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from its westerly US 42 junction to Tiffin, a city around which it sweeps to the south with intersections at various state highways that radiate out from downtown. US 224 passes through a commercial strip on the south side of Willard, and goes through downtown Findlay and Ottawa, but it otherwise specializes in small towns along its course across northwest Ohio. It crosses US 250 east of Greenwich; State Route 4 (SR 4), a major north–south route, at Attica; US 23 south of Fostoria, and I-75 in Findlay, and has brief concurrences with US 127 and US 30 near Van Wert. It crosses the Ashland Railway just east of Willard, the Norfolk Southern Railway at Attica, CSX Transportation near US 23, in Findlay, and in Ottawa, and the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad west of Van Wert.

East of Lodi, US 224 meets the western terminus of I-76, with which it forms a concurrency. It is in this area, US 224 enters the Connecticut Western Reserve. Less than a mile later, both routes intersect with I-71. US 224 continues along with I-76 to Akron. Here, I-76 exits and heads north. Continuing on US 224, the route runs concurrently with I-277, a short auxiliary highway running through southern Akron. I-277 quickly ends, leaving US 224 to continue into a heavily wooded area. The highway then intersects with SR 43, SR 44, SR 169, SR 225, SR 14, SR 45 and SR 46. Shortly after crossing over SR 11, US 224 enters Boardman Township in Mahoning County, where it eventually crosses a YSRR right of way perpendicularly on its way to the interchange with I-680 before reaching the village of Poland. 

This stretch of US 224, through Canfield, Boardman and Poland, is known for its chronic congestion. The original routing of US 224 through the village of Poland turned southeast on Main Street (formerly SR 90, now SR 170) to Riverside Drive, then north on Riverside Drive to the current alignment. In 1954 a bridge was built across Yellow Creek and a new road was constructed from Main Street to Riverside Drive, including an intersection with Water Street (SR 616). As US 224 leaves the village of Poland it continues through rural terrain as it heads towards Pennsylvania.
===Pennsylvania===

US 224 crosses into Mahoning Township in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, and becomes West State Street, a two-lane, undivided road. The road heads through wooded areas with some homes and commercial establishments, heading to the east-southeast. The route curves to the northeast in Peanut and passes over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Youngstown Line, coming to an intersection with PA 551. Here, PA 551 turns northeast to form a concurrency with US 224. The road heads through wooded areas and crosses the Mahoning River and CSX&#x27;s New Castle Subdivision railroad line. PA 551 splits from US 224 by heading north on North Edinburg Road, with US 224 continuing into wooded areas with some farm fields. The road turns to the southeast and enters Union Township. The route continues through wooded areas with some farmland and homes, passing to the south of New Castle Municipal Airport and heading through the community of Parkstown. US 224 heads into commercial areas, gaining a second lane westbound before widening into a six-lane divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-376/US 422.

Past this interchange, the road becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and passes through a mix of residences and businesses, running through the community of Oakwood. The route heads into the city of New Castle and passes through wooded areas of development, gaining a second westbound lane and coming to an intersection with US 422 Business. At this point, US 422 Business turns east to join US 224 on four-lane divided West Falls Street, passing more development and crossing over a New Castle Industrial Railroad line and the Shenango River. The road heads to the east and continues through commercial areas. US 224 ends at an intersection with PA 18, at which point US 422 Business turns south to join that route.

==History==

US 224 was assigned to a portion of the Benjamin Franklin Highway, an auto trail running from Omaha, Nebraska to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; its number assignment was an alternative to a westward rerouting of US 422 which runs along the Benjamin Franklin Highway farther east.

When US 224 was commissioned in Indiana in 1934, it replaced State Road 16 (SR 16), from Huntington to the Ohio state line.

Although US 224 is only in Pennsylvania for 10 miles, the eastern terminus has changed several times since 1933, ending at various points in New Castle, Pennsylvania or in adjacent Union Township west of the city. The eastern terminus has been moved five times (1936, 1947, 1974, 1977, 2008), the most notable of which was in the 1970s when the New Castle Bypass opened in 1974 and the state extended US 224 through the city and into Shenango Township at the eastern terminus of the bypass, taking over US 422&#x27;s old alignment after that highway was moved to the bypass.

The route was truncated back at the current interchange with US 422 and I-376 in 1977 while the old alignment through New Castle was replaced by Business US 422. This would be the case until March 20, 2008, when US 224 was officially extended to PA 18 inside the New Castle city limits with the placement of new signs. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) requested approval from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for the extension in August 2007. and received it the following month.

The extension of US 224 marked the second extension of a major highway into downtown New Castle in a little more than a year, as Pennsylvania Route 65 was extended a mile from its previous terminus with Business 422 to the PA 108/PA 168 concurrency in February 2007.

==Future==
Due to a higher-than-average number of crash-related injuries and fatalities along a stretch of US 224 in Medina County, Ohio, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) recommended converting three intersections, Vandemark, Westfield and Leroy roads, to restricted crossing U-turns. The highest-priority intersection, with Westfield Road in Westfield Township, was awarded $578,000 in ODOT funding and began construction in May 2019 and finished by the end of summer 2019.

There is a $2.4 million project north of the city of Van Wert to replace the current intersection of US 224, US 127 and Marsh Road (County Road 13) with a roundabout. The project began in January 2022 and was completed in October.

<doc id="902735" wikidata="Q1075161" url="?curid=902735" title="House of Munsö">
<text>The House of Munsö (), also called the House of Björn Ironside (Swedish: ), the House of Uppsala (Swedish: ) or simply the Old dynasty (Swedish: ), is the earliest reliably attested royal dynasty of Sweden, ruling during the Viking Age. None of the names suggested for the dynasty are universally accepted and most are problematic; the name &quot;House of Munsö&quot; derives from a questionable and speculative theory that they would have ruled from the island of Munsö and the name &quot;House of Björn Ironside&quot; derives from the supposed founder of the dynasty, Björn Ironside, who is often seen as a legendary, rather than historical, figure.

A long and elaborate sequence of kings of the Munsö dynasty can be found in 12th and 13th century Icelandic sagas, but the sagas are overwhelmingly considered unreliable, with the kings that appear in them seen as legendary figures. The sequence of kings in the sagas is contradicted by more contemporary German sources such as the 9th century writings of Rimbert and the 11th century work of Adam of Bremen.

== Etymology and historiography ==

Due to a lack of preserved sources, little concrete information is known of Swedish kings during the Viking Age. Although long and elaborate king lists are provided by Icelandic sagas, sometimes contradictory mixtures of myths and poetry, and poems, these works (including texts such as &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and &quot;Langfeðgatal&quot;) are not considered reliable sources by modern scholars. Critically, a majority of them were written in the 12th to 13th century, centuries after the kings they described are supposed to have lived; what is genuine history and what is myth and legend is impossible to determine and everything contained in them must as such be regarded as legendary, if not fictional. The 12th and 13th centuries was a time when royal power was being consolidated in Norway, Denmark and Sweden and as such, king lists may have been created out of a political and social needs (i.e. justifying the rule of a royal dynasty), rather than a desire to tell genuine history. Many of Sweden&#x27;s legendary kings would have preceded the Viking Age, but historical evidence of early geopolitics in Scandinavia suggests that larger political structures, kingdoms such as medieval Sweden, Norway and Denmark, did not form until the late Viking Age. The centralization of power under one monarch is believed to have resulted from, or at the very least have been connected to, Viking expansion, with petty kings increasing their power through aggressive military ventures directed both to foreign lands (i.e. Viking raids) and against their neighbors.

In his 12th-century work &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Danish author Saxo Grammaticus wrote that the Swedish kings of the Viking Age were part of the dynasty of the Ynglings, a possibly entirely invented line of ancient Scandinavian kings supposedly descended from Odin, but this does not accord with the Icelandic sagas, which hold that the Ynglings were driven from Sweden in the middle of the 7th century and replaced by other dynasties. There is no preserved contemporary name for the Viking Age dynasty, and there exists no universally accepted name for them in modern historiography. The name &quot;House of Munsö&quot; () derives from a questionable and speculative theory that the kings of the 9th century transferred their royal seat of power from Uppsala (an important early political center in Sweden) to the island of Munsö in the lake Mälaren. The supportive evidence for this theory; a large burial mound on Munsö and a contemporary account by German missionary Rimbert giving the impression that the Swedish king had his seat near the island-settlement of Birka, is quite thin. Since the name &quot;House of Munsö&quot; arguably takes a stand in favor of this theory, it is commonly avoided in modern Swedish scholarship. The name &quot;House of Uppsala&quot; () derives from the fact that the Icelandic sagas often designate legendary Swedish rulers as kings &quot;in Uppsala&quot;, and is similarly problematic. The dynasty is thus sometimes simply designated as &quot;the Old dynasty&quot; (), a more neutral designation. The rarely used name &quot;House of Björn Ironside&quot; () comes from the dynasty supposedly descending from the legendary Viking Björn Ironside according to the later Icelandic sagas. The big burial mound at Munsö was attributed, without evidence, to Björn Ironside by 18th-century historians, an identification that is not accepted by historians today.

== Kings of the Munsö dynasty ==

The line of Munsö dynasty kings presented by the Icelandic sagas is not accepted by modern historians, the legendary kings (including the supposed founder of the dynasty, Björn Ironside) typically not being recognized as actual historical figures. The four kings of the dynasty whose existence is corroborated by multiple sources, and who are thus generally accepted as real historical kings of Sweden and recognized as such by the modern Swedish monarchy are Eric the Victorious, Olof Skötkonung, Anund Jacob and Emund the Old. The answer to the question regarding who was Sweden&#x27;s first king depends on what is meant with &quot;Sweden&quot;; the earliest king reliably known to have ruled both Svealand and Götaland, the core territories of the country, was Olof Skötkonung, who is also listed first in most medieval Swedish king lists.

=== Legendary kings ===
===Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks===
The Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks has in some versions an addition which gives a regnal list of Sweden following the death of Ingjald Illråde, the last king of the Yngling dynasty. Sweden was first ruled by Ivar Vidfamne, then Harald Wartooth and his son Eysteinn Beli, before Björn Ironside conquered Sweden. He founded the House of Munsö, and the saga then follows his descendants until Philip of Sweden.

The following chart maps the descendants of Björn Ironside according to the saga:
===Vita Ansgari and Adam of Bremen===
Rimbert, who travelled with the bishop Ansgar to Sweden as a missionary in the 9th century, wrote about several kings in &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot;. As Rimbert was a contemporary to the kings he writes about, the Vita is seen as a believable source. Adam of Bremen alludes to the kings mentioned by Rimbert and expands the list of kings to cover the following centuries. However, the distance in time is greater, and he is thus seen as a weaker source for the time before Eric the Victorious. Though no genealogical information is provided by either which confidently connects the kings they mention with Eric the Victorious and his descendants, they are typically assumed to have been part of the same royal dynasty. Attempts have been made to harmonize Rimbert&#x27;s and Adam of Bremen&#x27;s kings with the kings mentioned in the sagas (whose existence is otherwise seen as contradicted by their writings), but due to a lack of documented evidence, such attempts have to be considered unreliable and unverifiable.

====Kings from the Vita====
* Björn, who reigned 829 when Ansgar first visited Sweden at the important port-settlement of Birka. Björn was reportedly friendly to the missionaries but chose not to convert to Christianity (although one of his chief councilors, Hergeir, did).
*Anund, who is not mentioned as ruling over Birka (possibly ruling somewhere else in Sweden), having been driven from Sweden and taken refuge among the Danes. Anund promised Birka to the Danes as a reward for helping him gain revenge and attacked Birka 840. As Birka continues to be ruled by Swedish kings, it is unlikely that the attack succeeded.
* Eric, who was recently deceased by the time Ansgar visited Sweden for the second time 852. According to Rimbert&#x27;s writings, some of the Anti-Christian Swedes suggested that Eric be worshipped as a god alongside the rest of the Nordic pantheon instead of the new Christian God.
* Olof, who reigned 852, during Ansgar&#x27;s second visit to Sweden, having then only recently come to the throne. Olof&#x27;s position of power was weak, since he did not dare support Ansgar&#x27;s and Rimbert&#x27;s Christianization mission out of fear of upsetting his people. According to Rimbert, Olof had to negotiate with his own nobles and the will of the gods (i.e. what should be done) was eventually determined through a lottery-like system, the results of which was determined by a council of religious figures rather than the king. Olof apparently warred against Courland.

====Kings from Adam of Bremen====
* Ring, possibly together with his sons Eric and Emund. If he co-ruled with his sons, they reigned 936. If there was not a co-regency, Ring might have ruled earlier, with his second son Emund reigning 936.
* Eric, son of Ring and either his co-ruler or direct successor.
* Emund, son of Ring and either co-ruler with Ring and Eric Ringsson, or the direct successor of Eric Ringsson.
* Emund, son of Eric and the direct successor of Emund Ringsson (or some co-ruler arrangement of the previous three monarchs). Adam of Bremen gives this king as Eric the Victorious&#x27;s predecessor.

===Other kings===
There are also a few kings mentioned in various sources, but which are inconsitenstly placed in the regnal list, or not at all. These include:
* Eric, attested by the Sparlösa Runestone (from 800) as a king at Uppsala.
*Eric Weatherhat
*Erik Årsäll

=== Theory ===

*Ragnvald Ingvarsson, historian Omeljan Pritsak speculated that he could be related to Munsö house due to his rank in Varangian guards.
*Ingvar the Far-Travelled

<text>U.S. Route 129 (US 129) is an auxiliary route of US 29, which it intersects in Athens, Georgia. US 129 currently runs for from an intersection with US 19/US 27 ALT/US 98 in Chiefland, Florida, to an interchange with Interstate 40 (I-40) in Knoxville, Tennessee. It passes through the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. It goes through the cities of Macon, Athens, Gainesville, and Knoxville.

The section that is located beside Deals Gap on the North Carolina–Tennessee state line is known as or from its winding course. It is a popular motorcycle and sports car destination. This segment runs from Tab Cat Creek to Deals Gap and has about 318 curves in this 11 mile section.

==Route description==

===Florida===
US 129 begins at US 19/US 27 Alternate/US 98 in Chiefland, Florida, along hidden SR 47 until it reaches SR 26 in Trenton. From there, the road is signed along hidden SR 49. It then moves west, briefly overlapping US 27 (hidden SR 20) and heads north again in Branford, before that road intersects SR 349, which used to also serve as US 129 Alternate. From here, it intersects with US 90/SR 51 in Live Oak, taking SR 51 as the new hidden state road, then meets I-10 at exit 283, and later I-75 at exit 451. During a concurrency with US 41 in Jasper, US 129 loses SR 51 as a hidden route after the concurrency ends and runs northwest along SR 100 into Georgia.

===Georgia===

US 129 provides the primary route between central Georgia and Athens. It approaches Athens from the south where it joins SR 10 Loop, a mostly interstate-grade bypass that rings Athens-Clarke County. Here US 129 turns right, toward the northeast, where it runs concurrently with US 78/US 29/US 441/SR 15 (and unsigned SR 422) along the bypass. US 129 intersects with US 29 northeast of Athens and continues along SR 10 Loop westward before exiting at Jefferson Road where it winds northwesterly towards Gainesville as one of several routes to I-85 from Athens.

===North Carolina===

From the Georgia state line, it travels northeast to Topton, where it goes north to Robbinsville followed by Tennessee, through Deals Gap.

===Tennessee===
US 129 enters Tennessee to the west of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and rides along Chilhowee Lake for a short distance before turning due north. In this stretch after the Tennessee–North Carolina state line, drivers will encounter 318 curves in a distance of around 11 miles. These curves make this stretch of highway a well-known motorcycle/sports car destination named Tail Of The Dragon. On weekends, through spring to the fall months, visitors are likely to see numerous riders and drivers on this stretch of the highway to experience the thrill and scenery. US 129 then travels due north, becoming known as Alcoa Highway and passing through the city of Maryville. It travels through Alcoa, passing by McGhee Tyson Airport, and then intersecting I-140. US 129 then crosses the Tennessee River on the James E. &quot;Buck&quot; Karnes Bridge into Knoxville. Shortly thereafter, US 129 becomes a limited-access highway for a short distance. It has an interchange with US 11/US 70 immediately after entering Knoxville. Shortly thereafter, US 129 meets its northern terminus, an interchange with I-40.

==In popular culture==
U.S. 129 is mentioned in the popular country song Bottoms Up by Brantley Gilbert: &quot;I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde, Goin 95 burning down 129.&quot;

U.S. 129 is known particularly for being a route containing hundreds of mountainous curves and turns (in the Tennessee section). With the rise of the internet and telecommunications, the Tennessee section of the route has become popularized by its motoring enthusiasts who share their experiences through social messaging boards and media outlets. This small stretch of around 11 miles starting at Deals Gap just before the Tennessee state line in North Carolina, has been nicknamed Tail Of The Dragon.

<text>Walter Clement Alvarez (July 22, 1884June 18, 1978) was an American physician of Spanish descent. He authored several dozen books on medicine, and wrote introductions and forewords for many others.

==Biography==
He was born in San Francisco and spent his childhood in Hawaii, where his father was a government physician. In 1910, having received his medical education in Stanford University, he began his practice.

From 1913 to the end of 1925, Alvarez practiced internal medicine in San Francisco and conducted research at the University of California, Berkeley. He lived at 3837 Clay Street raising his family. In 1934, he became Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota (Mayo Foundation) and later served as Consultant in Medicine Emeritus.

His father was Luis F. Alvarez, who worked as a physician in California and Hawaii and developed a method for the better diagnosis of macular leprosy. His sister was California artist and oil painter Mabel Alvarez.

Alvarez was married to the former Harriet Skidmore Smythe and the couple had four children: Gladys, Luis, Robert and Bernice. Luis later became a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

His grandson is Walter Alvarez, a Professor of Geology at the University of California, Berkeley.

Beginning after his retirement in 1951, Alvarez began writing a medical column which soon became syndicated throughout North America in hundreds of daily and weekly newspapers. The &quot;Walter C. Alvarez Memorial Award&quot; is named in his honor and is presented to a member or nonmember of the American Medical Writers Association to honor excellence in communicating health care developments and concepts to the public. He is most notable for his enlightened approach to homosexuality and his efforts to educate the medical profession and the broader public about the topic. He is regarded as an ally of the homophile movement in the 1950s-1970s.

&quot;Alvarez&#x27; syndrome&quot;, a syndrome of hysterical or neurotic abdominal bloating without any excess of gas in the digestive tract, and &quot;Alvarez-waves&quot;, painless uterine contractions occurring during the length of pregnancy, are named after him.

Alvarez was the first to investigate electric activity of a stomach and, thereby, became the founder of a new diagnostic gastroenterology branch — electrogastrography.

He died in California in 1978.

His personal papers are held by Lane&#x27;s Archives and Special Collections.

== Alvarez&#x27; syndrome ==
Alvarez&#x27; syndrome is a medical disorder in which the abdomen becomes bloated without any obvious reason, such as intestinal gas. It may be caused when the muscles of the superior abdominal wall contract and push the contents of the abdomen inferiorly and anteriorly. It may be a psychogenic disorder. It was discovered by and named by Alvarez in the late 1940s.

<doc id="902750" wikidata="Q2523483" url="?curid=902750" title="Unconditional election">
<text>Unconditional election (also called sovereign election or unconditional grace) is a Calvinist doctrine relating to predestination that describes the actions and motives of God prior to his creation of the world, when he predestined some people to receive salvation, the elect, and the rest he left to continue in their sins and receive the just punishment, eternal damnation, for their transgressions of God&#x27;s law as outlined in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. God made these choices according to his own purposes apart from any conditions or qualities related to those persons.

The counter-view to unconditional election is the Arminian view of conditional election, the belief that God chooses for eternal salvation those whom he foreknows will exercise their free will to respond to God&#x27;s prevenient grace with faith in Christ. God&#x27;s election was for a clear unalterable purpose, to elect those who will believe.

==Summary==
In Calvinist theology, unconditional election is considered to be one aspect of predestination in which God chooses certain individuals to be saved. Those elected receive mercy, while those not elected, the reprobates, receive justice without condition. This unconditional election is essentially related to the rest of the TULIP (five points of Calvinism) doctrinal outline and hinges upon the supreme belief in the absolute sovereignty of God over the affairs of humans. God unconditionally elects certain people even though they are sinful as an act of his saving grace apart from the shortcomings or will of man. Those chosen have done nothing to deserve this grace.

In Calvinist and some other churches (Waldensians, Katharoi, Anabaptists, Particular Baptists, etc.) this election has been called &quot;unconditional&quot; because his choice to save the elect does not depend on anything inherent in any person chosen, on any act that a person performs or on any belief that a person exercises.

According to the doctrine of total depravity (the first of the five points of Calvinism), the influence of sin has so inhibited the individual&#x27;s volition that no one is willing or able to come to or follow God apart from God first regenerating the person&#x27;s soul to give them the ability to love him and take part in the salvation process. Hence, God&#x27;s choice in election is, and can only be based solely on, God&#x27;s own independent and sovereign will and [not] upon the foreseen actions of man.

Scholastic Calvinists have sometimes debated precisely when, relative to the decree for the fall of man, God did his electing – see supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism – though such distinctions are not often emphasized in modern Calvinism.

The Reformed position is frequently contrasted with the Arminian doctrine of conditional election in which God&#x27;s eternal choice to save a person is conditioned on God&#x27;s certain foreknowledge of future events, namely, that certain individuals would freely exercise faith and trust in response to God&#x27;s offer of salvation. The Arminian doctrine agrees that the influence of sin has so inhibited the individual&#x27;s volition that no one is willing or able to come to or follow God, but the Arminian doctrine of prevenient (or &quot;enabling&quot;) grace is considered sufficient to enable a person to repent and believe before regeneration. Based upon God&#x27;s foreknowledge of each individual human response to the gospel of Jesus Christ, God justly and sovereignly elects to salvation those he foresees exercising free will to repent, believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ and follow God.

==History==
The doctrine was first articulated and popularized by 4th century Church Father Augustine of Hippo during his debates with Pelagius, and he taught that saving grace is bestowed by God on the elect according to his sovereign decrees. Few later theologians prior to the Reformation would take up this idea. However, prominent exceptions include Thomas Aquinas.

Unconditional election was first codified in the Belgic Confession (1561), re-affirmed in the Canons of Dort (1619), which arose from the Quinquarticular Controversy, and is represented in the various Reformed confessions such as the Westminster Standards (1646). Today, it is most commonly associated with the Reformation teachings of John Calvin as one of the five points of Calvinism and is often linked with predestination.

==Biblical passages==

A number of passages are put forth to support the doctrine, including (quotations are from the KJV):

* Isaiah 42:1: &quot;Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect Chosen One, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.&quot;
* John 1:12,13: &quot;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&quot;
* Acts 13:48: &quot;And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.&quot;
* Romans 9:15–16: &quot;For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.&quot;
* Romans 9:22–24: &quot;What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?&quot;
* Ephesians 1:4–5: &quot;According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,&quot;
* Ephesians 1:11: &quot;In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:&quot;
* Philippians 1:29: &quot;For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;&quot;
* 1 Thessalonians 1:4–5: &quot;Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.&quot;
* 2 Thessalonians 2:13: &quot;But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:&quot;
* 2 Timothy 1:9: &quot;Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,&quot;

Some biblical passages are put forth as evidence that human volition, not just divine action, plays a central role in salvation (see conditional election):
* Deuteronomy 30:19: &quot;I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:&quot;
* Joshua 24:15: &quot;And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.&quot;

Calvinists generally understand the former passages as giving a window into the divine perspective and the latter passages as speaking from the human perspective in calling people to work out the salvation God has given them.

<text>U.S. Route 231 (US 231) is a north–south U.S highway that is a parallel route of US 31. It runs for from St. John, Indiana, at US 41 to south of US 98 in downtown Panama City, Florida.
One of its most notable landmarks is the William H. Natcher Bridge, a long cable-stayed bridge that connects Rockport, Indiana, to Owensboro, Kentucky, spanning the Ohio River.

==Route description==

===Florida===

In Florida, US 231 is paired with unsigned State Road 75. The southern terminus is at Business US 98 (unsigned State Road 30) in downtown Panama City. The highway is carried by Harrison Avenue until its intersection with US 98. Continuing north, US 231 passes through Youngstown, Fountain, Alford, Cottondale, and Campbellton before entering Alabama. Major intersections include Business US 98, US 98, SR 77, SR 20, Interstate 10, US 90, SR 73, SR 273, and SR 2.

===Alabama===
In Alabama, US 231 is an alternate north-to-south route to Interstate 65, the main north-to-south thoroughfare in the state. U.S. Route 231 serves the east-central part of the state, with I-65 further west and US 431 further east. While both US 231 and US 431 connect the major cities of Dothan and Huntsville, US 231 has a shorter route through fewer cities and terrain changes, avoiding the mountainous cities of Albertville, Gadsden, Oxford, and Heflin. However, there are some mountainous cities along the route, such as Arab and Oneonta.

U.S. Route 231 is divided along two-lane roads, three-laned roads, and four-laned undivided and divided highways. The entire stretch south of Montgomery is four-laned, mostly divided with some undivided stretches; as it is a critical connector in the National Highway System, which is a very important web of highways critical to U.S. infrastructure. The stretch between Arab and the state line is an almost entirely four-lane divided highway.

Through Huntsville, Alabama, the route functions as Memorial Parkway - the main north-to-south freeway through downtown. The road is a freeway with frontage roads and Texas U-Turns, with some stretches with six lanes plus a frontage road exit lane in each direction. In the medical district of Huntsville, the freeway gains US 431 and loses the SR 53 designation. The road widens to ten lanes on the south side of Interstate 565, with the gained lanes used as access lanes for US 72 or I-565. On the north side of I-565, the road once again goes to six lanes and an exit lane, which is carried along its concurrency with US 72. About a mile north of the second junction with US 72, the route loses its frontage roads and reverts to a four-lane divided highway.
In general, the route is an important connector between Dothan, Montgomery, and Huntsville, three of the most populous cities in the state.

===Tennessee===

US 231 enters Tennessee from Alabama in a concurrency with US 431 until it reaches Fayetteville. North of there it runs through Shelbyville and later passes through the eastern part of the Nashville metro area, passing through the cities of Murfreesboro and Lebanon. By the time it reaches Bethpage, it joins U.S. Route 31E in another concurrency to the northeast before finally crossing the Kentucky State Line north of Westmoreland. The route is approximately from Tennessee&#x27;s northern border to its southern border.

===Kentucky===

US 231 parallels Interstate 65 before reaching Bowling Green. From Bowling Green, US 231 closely parallels I-165 (formerly the William H. Natcher Parkway) until it reaches Owensboro. At Owensboro, US 231 joins US 60 (also known as the Wendell H. Ford Expressway) around the city&#x27;s east side, which it then follows to just north of Maceo. US 60 then leaves toward the east while US 231 turns to the north, leaving the state via the William H. Natcher Bridge across the Ohio River.

A portion of the Owensboro-area route is relatively new; in 2014, a new section from Kentucky 54 to Kentucky 2830 opened, bypassing the former bypass route. Part of that former route has been renumbered as Kentucky 603. The remainder, south of 603, is partly a dead-end city street and an abandoned lane that will eventually become part of the David Adkisson Greenbelt trail.

===Indiana===

In Indiana, US 231 has the distinction of being the state&#x27;s longest continuous highway. It covers approximately in the Hoosier State. US 231 passes through the towns of Dale, Huntingburg, Jasper, and Loogootee before reaching Bloomfield. In Bloomfield, US 231 passes Shawnee Field, a local airport. US 231 slices through central Indiana before reaching West Lafayette, where it runs just south and west of Purdue University. Next it mostly zigzags north and west, staying close to Interstate 65, before heading straight west from Crown Point, terminating at US 41.

Indiana&#x27;s Major Moves program, which derives its funding from the lease of the Indiana Toll Road to private interests, has made it possible for the state to build many new miles of roadway throughout the state. As part of this program, US 231 is currently being updated to a new-terrain four-lane highway from the Indiana-Kentucky border through Spencer County to Interstate 64. This segment of US 231 has been named the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Parkway.

As of April 2011, the Lincoln Parkway is complete from the Kentucky line to the interchange at I-64 and the bypass of Dale at the northernmost end of the project. It is a fully operational partial cloverleaf and the previous two-lane 231 overpass has been demolished. It has been replaced by a new four-lane overpass.

The section from SR 162 to Indiana State Highway 70 near Chrisney was the last to be opened, after a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 15, 2011, much sooner than the original July 2011 projected date.

In addition to the Spencer County project, a four-lane bypass of the Dubois County cities of Huntingburg and Jasper is also in the planning stages, but funding has not been secured. A firm timetable for construction has yet to materialize.

==History==

U.S. Route 152 was commissioned in 1934, connecting Indianapolis with Hammond. It followed US 52 from Indianapolis to northwest of Lafayette, where it turned north to end at US 20 in Hammond. In 1938, the route was decommissioned, and became a southern extension of State Road 53 from northwest of Lafayette to Crown Point, a new State Road 152 from Highland to Hammond, and was simply dropped in favor of the overlapping US 52, State Road 8, and US 41 elsewhere. These parts of SR 53 and SR 8 became US 231 in 1952, when US 231 was extended north from Montgomery to US 41 south of St. John.

<text>City is a 1952 science fiction fix-up novel by American writer Clifford D. Simak. The original version consists of eight linked short stories, all originally published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; under the editorship of John W. Campbell between 1944 and 1951, along with brief &quot;notes&quot; on each of the stories. These notes were specially written for the book, and serve as a bridging story of their own. The book was reprinted as ACE #D-283 in 1958, cover illustration by Ed Valigursky.

A ninth &quot;City&quot; tale was published in 1973, called &quot;Epilog&quot;. Many later editions include the ninth tale.

==Plot introduction==
The fixup novel describes a legend consisting of eight &quot;tales&quot; that the pastoral, pacifist Dogs recite as they pass down an oral legend of a creature known as &quot;Man&quot;. Each tale is preceded by &quot;doggish&quot; notes and learned discussion.

An editor&#x27;s preface notes that after each telling of the legend the pups ask many questions:

== Plot summary ==
===The Tales===
As the tales unfold, they recount a world where humans, having developed superior transportation, have abandoned the cities and moved into the countryside. Hydroponic farming and decentralized power allow small communities to become self-sufficient. In the beginning, the driving force for dispersion is the fear of nuclear holocaust, but eventually humans discover they simply prefer the pastoral lifestyle.

The tales primarily focus around the Webster family and their robot servant, Jenkins. The name Webster gradually becomes &quot;webster&quot;, a noun meaning a human. Themes familiar to Simak readers recur in these stories, notably the pastoral settings and the faithful dogs.

Each successive tale tells of further breakdown of urban society. As mankind abandons the cities, each family becomes increasingly isolated. Bruce Webster surgically provides dogs with a means of speech and he gives them contact lenses for better vision. The breakdown of civilization allows wandering mutant geniuses to grow up unrestrained by conventional mores. A mutant called Joe invents a way for ants to stay active year-round in Wisconsin, so that they need not start over every spring. Eventually, the ants form an industrial society in their hill. The amoral Joe, tiring of the game, kicks over the anthill. The ants ignore this setback and build bigger and more industrialized colonies.

A later tale tells of a research station on the surface of Jupiter. (This story, first published as &quot;Desertion&quot; in 1944, was one of the first stories about pantropy.) Simak&#x27;s version of Jupiter is a cold, windswept, and corrosive hell where only advanced technology allows the station to exist at all. A scientist is accompanied by Towser, his tired and flea-bitten old dog. But there is a problem: Men permanently transformed to survive unaided on Jupiter&#x27;s surface leave the station to gather data and inexplicably fail to return. Finally, the scientist transforms himself and his canine companion into the seal-like beings that can survive the surface. They leave the station in their new form and experience Jupiter as a paradise. Towser&#x27;s fleas and irritations are gone and he is able to talk telepathically to his former master. Like the previously transformed station personnel, the scientist decides never to return.

He eventually does return, to share with all humankind what he has discovered. It seems impossible – how can he show them the wondrous Jupiter that he and Towser perceive? Joe steps in again, once more out of sheer mischief. He knows a mind trick to allow people to broadcast meaning to others&#x27; minds as they speak. By means of a kaleidoscope-like instrument, he can twist the minds of other people so they can perform the mind trick. Thus all humanity learns the truth about Jupiter, and most elect to leave Earth, give up their physical humanity and live transformed on Jupiter&#x27;s surface.

Simak&#x27;s vision of human apocalypse is unusual, not one of destruction, but simply of isolation. Much of humankind becomes so lonely that it eventually dies off. Some favor starting over as a completely different species capable of experiencing on Jupiter the simple bliss that humans have otherwise lost.

Ten thousand years in the future, Jenkins is provided with a new body so he can better serve the few remaining &quot;websters&quot;. By then, the dog civilization has spread all around the Earth, including the rest of the animals whom, little by little, the dogs introduce to their civilization. All of them are significantly intelligent, and Simak appears to mean that they were so all the while even though humans were not able to notice it. This civilization is a pacifist and vegetarian one. The dogs intervene in nature and distribute food to wild animals, managing to end virtually all predation. Besides, they also look for doors between dimensions through which some beings from different worlds are able to pass. At this point, a wraithlike creature called a &quot;cobbly&quot; appears, having traveled from another world on the time thread. Before it is driven away, Jenkins&#x27;s new telepathic sense enables him to read the creature&#x27;s mind to discover how it moves from world to world. Realizing that humanity cannot peacefully coexist with the Dogs and the other animals, Jenkins uses the knowledge to take his human charges to one of the other worlds. Eventually, the human race dies out on the new world.

However, returning to the initial Earth in the final tale of the book, Jenkins finds the dogs dealing with the ever-growing Ant City, which is taking over the Earth. Jenkins travels to Geneva, where a last small group of humans sleep in suspended animation. He asks his former master, a Webster, how to deal with the ants. The answer is typically human – poisoned bait, enough to kill but not before the bait is taken back to the ant colony to kill widely there. Jenkins is saddened because he realizes the Dogs will never accept this solution. He tells the dogs that the &quot;websters&quot; had no answer. The Dogs leave Earth for one of the other worlds.

The original eight stories were written and published during World War II and reflect the attitude that humans are unable to live at peace with their fellow beings. There is an underlying theme throughout the book that humans possess a fundamental aggressive flaw they will never be able to overcome.

===The Coda===
Simak wrote the ninth and last tale in the City saga in 1973, twenty-two years after he wrote the previous episode. Jenkins is on the original Earth, living at the old Webster home, surrounded on all sides by the Ant City. He comes to realize that the Ant City is dead, just as a spaceship returns to take him to the robot worlds. Breaking through the wall of the city, he sees nothing but infinitely repeated versions of a single sculpture; a human boot kicking over an anthill.

==Reception==
Groff Conklin described &quot;City&quot; as a &quot;strange and fascinating program ... completely enthralling&quot;. Boucher and McComas praised the volume as &quot;a high-water mark in science fiction writing&quot; adding, &quot;Here is a book that caused these reviewers to chuck objective detachment out the window and emit a loud, partisan &#x27;Whee! P. Schuyler Miller placed the novel among the best science fiction books of 1952, although he felt the added interstitial matter was inferior to the original stories. In his &quot;Books&quot; column for &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, Damon Knight selected &quot;City&quot; as one of the 10 best sf books of the 1950s. Algis Budrys called it &quot;the outstanding example of a pasteup that had been begging to be done&quot;. Michel Houellebecq, in a 2010 interview with the &quot;Paris Review&quot;, describes the book as a masterpiece.

<text>Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure sores, bed sores or pressure injuries, are localised damage to the skin and/or underlying tissue that usually occur over a bony prominence as a result of usually long-term pressure, or pressure in combination with shear or friction. The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum, coccyx, heels, and hips, though other sites can be affected, such as the elbows, knees, ankles, back of shoulders, or the back of the cranium.
Pressure ulcers occur due to pressure applied to soft tissue resulting in completely or partially obstructed blood flow to the soft tissue. Shear is also a cause, as it can pull on blood vessels that feed the skin. Pressure ulcers most commonly develop in individuals who are not moving about, such as those who are on chronic bedrest or consistently use a wheelchair. It is widely believed that other factors can influence the tolerance of skin for pressure and shear, thereby increasing the risk of pressure ulcer development. These factors are protein-calorie malnutrition, microclimate (skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence), diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin, such as arteriosclerosis, or diseases that reduce the sensation in the skin, such as paralysis or neuropathy. The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the person, medical conditions (such as arteriosclerosis, diabetes or infection), smoking or medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs.
Although often prevented and treatable if detected early, pressure ulcers can be very difficult to prevent in critically ill people, frail elders, and individuals with impaired mobility such as wheelchair users (especially where spinal injury is involved). Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by regularly turning the person. The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century. In addition to turning and re-positioning the person in the bed or wheelchair, eating a balanced diet with adequate protein and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is important.
The rate of pressure ulcers in hospital settings is high; the prevalence in European hospitals ranges from 8.3% to 23%, and the prevalence was 26% in Canadian healthcare settings from 1990 to 2003. In 2013, there were 29,000 documented deaths from pressure ulcers globally, up from 14,000 deaths in 1990.

The United States has tracked rates of pressure injury since the early 2000s. Whittington and Briones reported nationwide rates of pressure injuries in hospitals of 6% to 8%. By the early 2010s, one study showed the rate of pressure injury had dropped to about 4.5% across the Medicare population following the introduction of the International Guideline for pressure injury prevention. Padula and colleagues have witnessed a +29% uptick in pressure injury rates in recent years associated with the rollout of penalizing Medicare policies.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Pressure ulcers can trigger other ailments, cause considerable suffering, and can be expensive to treat. Some complications include autonomic dysreflexia, bladder distension, bone infection, pyarthrosis, sepsis, amyloidosis, anemia, urethral fistula, gangrene and very rarely malignant transformation (Marjolin&#x27;s ulcer – secondary carcinomas in chronic wounds). Sores may recur if those with pressure ulcers do not follow recommended treatment or may instead develop seromas, hematomas, infections, or wound dehiscence. Paralyzed individuals are the most likely to have pressure sores recur. In some cases, complications from pressure sores can be life-threatening. The most common causes of fatality stem from kidney failure and amyloidosis.
Pressure ulcers are also painful, with individuals of all ages and all stages of pressure ulcers reporting pain.

==Cause==
There are four mechanisms that contribute to pressure ulcer development:
# External (interface) pressure applied over an area of the body, especially over the bony prominences can result in obstruction of the blood capillaries, which deprives tissues of oxygen and nutrients, causing ischemia (deficiency of blood in a particular area), hypoxia (inadequate amount of oxygen available to the cells), edema, inflammation, and, finally, necrosis and ulcer formation. Ulcers due to external pressure occur over the sacrum and coccyx, followed by the trochanter and the calcaneus (heel).
# Friction is damaging to the superficial blood vessels directly under the skin. It occurs when two surfaces rub against each other. The skin over the elbows can be injured due to friction. The back can also be injured when patients are pulled or slid over bed sheets while being moved up in bed or transferred onto a stretcher.
# Shearing is a separation of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially sitting up in bed, skin may stick to the sheet, making the skin susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward the foot of the bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.
# Moisture is also a common pressure ulcer culprit. Sweat, urine, feces, or excessive wound drainage can further exacerbate the damage done by pressure, friction, and shear. It can contribute to maceration of surrounding skin thus potentially expanding the deleterious effects of pressure ulcers.

===Risk factors===
There are over 100 risk factors for pressure ulcers. Factors that may place a patient at risk include immobility, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, malnutrition, cerebral vascular accident and hypotension. Other factors are age of 70 years and older, current smoking history, dry skin, low body mass index, urinary and fecal incontinence, physical restraints, malignancy, vasopressin prescription, and history of prior pressure injury development.

==Pathophysiology==
Pressure ulcers may be caused by inadequate blood supply and resulting reperfusion injury when blood re-enters tissue. A simple example of a mild pressure sore may be experienced by healthy individuals while sitting in the same position for extended periods of time: the dull ache experienced is indicative of impeded blood flow to affected areas. Within 2 hours, this shortage of blood supply, called ischemia, may lead to tissue damage and cell death. The sore will initially start as a red, painful area. The other process of pressure ulcer development is seen when pressure is high enough to damage the cell membrane of muscle cells. The muscle cells die as a result and skin fed through blood vessels coming through the muscle die. This is the deep tissue injury form of pressure ulcers and begins as purple intact skin.

According to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, pressure ulcers are one of the eight preventable iatrogenic illnesses. If a pressure ulcer is acquired in the hospital, the hospital will no longer receive reimbursement for the person&#x27;s care. Hospitals spend about $27 billion annually for treatment of pressure injuries. Whereas, the cost of pressure injury prevention is cost-effective, if not cost-saving, and would cost less than half the amount of resources to prevent compared to treat in health systems.

===Sites===

Common pressure sore sites include the skin over the coccyx, the sacrum, the ischia/ischium, the heels of the feet, over the heads of the long bones of the foot, buttocks, over the shoulder, and over the back of the head.

===Pressure reduction===
Pressure must be removed from high risk body areas by frequent changes in position in bed or chair including turning side to side. Chair cushions and air mattresses should be used for immobile patients. Heels should be off of the bed.

===Adequate diet===
Eating by mouth is preferred and intake of food and fluid should meet calorie, protein and fluid needs. Work with a dietician if needed. Supplements may be needed.

===Biofilm===
Biofilm is one of the most common reasons for delayed healing in pressure ulcers. Biofilm occurs rapidly in wounds and stalls healing by keeping the wound inflamed. Frequent debridement and antimicrobial dressings are needed to control the biofilm. Infection prevents the healing of pressure ulcers. Signs of pressure ulcer infection include slow or delayed healing and pale granulation tissue. Signs and symptoms of systemic infection include fever, pain, redness, swelling, warmth of the area, and purulent discharge. Additionally, infected wounds may have a gangrenous smell, be discolored, and may eventually produce more pus.

In order to eliminate this problem, it is imperative to apply antiseptics at once. Hydrogen peroxide (a near-universal toxin) is not recommended for this task as it increases inflammation and impedes healing. Cleaning the open wound with hypochlorous acid is helpful. Dressings with cadexomer iodine, silver, or honey have been shown to penetrate bacterial biofilms. Systemic antibiotics are not recommended in treating local infection in a pressure ulcer, as it can lead to bacterial resistance. They are only recommended if there is evidence of advancing cellulitis, bony infection, or bacteria in the blood.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===

The definitions of the pressure ulcer stages are revised periodically by the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) in the United States and the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) in Europe. Different classification systems are used around the world, depending upon the health system, the health discipline and the purpose for the classifying (e.g. health care versus, prevalence studies versus funding. Briefly, they are as follows:
* Stage 1: Intact skin with non-blanchable redness of a localized area usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching; its color may differ from the surrounding area. The area differs in characteristics such as thickness and temperature as compared to adjacent tissue. Stage 1 may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. May indicate &quot;at risk&quot; persons (a heralding sign of risk).
* Stage 2: Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum-filled blister. Presents as a shiny or dry shallow ulcer without slough or bruising. This stage should not be used to describe skin tears, tape burns, perineal dermatitis, maceration or excoriation.
* Stage 3: Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscle are not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining and tunneling. The depth of a stage 3 pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) subcutaneous tissue and stage 3 ulcers can be shallow. In contrast, areas of significant adiposity can develop extremely deep stage 3 pressure ulcers. Bone/tendon is not visible or directly palpable.
* Stage 4: Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often include undermining and tunneling. The depth of a stage 4 pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) subcutaneous tissue and these ulcers can be shallow. Stage 4 ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (e.g., fascia, tendon or joint capsule) making osteomyelitis likely to occur. Exposed bone/tendon is visible or directly palpable. In 2012, the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel stated that pressure ulcers with exposed cartilage are also classified as a stage 4.
* Unstageable: Full thickness tissue loss in which actual depth of the ulcer is completely obscured by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown or black) in the wound bed. Until enough slough and/or eschar is removed to expose the base of the wound, the true depth, and therefore stage, cannot be determined. Stable (dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) eschar on the heels is normally protective and should not be removed.
* Deep Tissue Pressure Injury (formerly suspected deep tissue injury): Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness pressure injury (Unstageable, Stage 3 or Stage 4). Do not use DTPI to describe vascular, traumatic, neuropathic, or dermatologic conditions.

The term medical device related pressure ulcer refers to a cause rather than a classification. Pressure ulcers from a medical device are classified according to the same classification system being used for pressure ulcers arising from other causes, but the cause is usually noted. Pressure injury from medical devices on mucous membranes should not be staged.

===Ischemic fasciitis===
Ischemic fasciitis (IF) is a benign tumor in the class of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors that, like pressure ulcers, may develop in elderly, bed-ridden individuals. These tumors commonly form in the subcutaneous tissues (i.e. lower most tissue layer of the skin) that overlie bony protuberances such as those in or around the hip, shoulder, greater trochanter of the femur, iliac crest, lumbar region, or scapular region. IF tumors differ from pressure ulcers in that they typically do not have extensive ulcerations of the skin and on histopathological microscopic analysis lack evidence of acute inflammation as determined by the presence of various types of white blood cells. These tumors are commonly treated by surgical removal.

==Prevention==
There are various approaches that are used widely for preventing pressure ulcers. Suggested approaches include modifications to bedding and mattresses, different support systems for taking pressure off of affected areas, airing of surfaces of the body, skin care, nutrition, and organizational modifications (for example, changing the care routines in hospitals or homes where people require extended bedrest). Overall, unbiased clinical studies to determine the effectiveness of these types of interventions and to determine the most effective intervention are needed in order to best prevent pressure ulcers. 

=== Clinical guidelines for preventing pressure ulcers ===
Numerous evidence-based and expert consensus-based clinical guidelines have been to developed to help guide medical professionals internationally and in specific countries including the UK. The Standardized Pressure Injury Prevention Protocol (SPIPP) Checklist is a derivative of the International Guideline that was designed to facilitate consistent implementation of pressure injury prevention. In 2022, United States Congress passed legislation updating the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 () to establish the SPIPP Checklist as law that United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities should adhere to in order to keep patients safe from harm.

=== Risk assessment ===
Before turning and repositioning a person, a risk assessment tool is suggested to determine what is the best approach for preventing pressure ulcers in that person. Some of the most common risk assessment tools are the Braden Scale, Norton, or Waterlow tools. The type of risk assessment tool that is used, will depend on which hospital the patient is admitted to and the location. After the risk assessment tool is used, a plan will be developed for the patient individually to prevent Hospital- Acquired Pressure Injuries. This plan will consist of different turning and repositioning strategies. These risk assessment tools provide the nursing staff with a baseline for each patient regarding their individual risk for acquiring a pressure injury. Factors that contribute to these risk assessment tools are moisture, activity, and mobility. These factors are considered and scored using the scale being used, whether it be the Braden, Norton, or Waterlow scale. The numbers are then added up and based on that final number, a score will be given and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that the patient is being properly repositioned. Unfortunately, this is not always completed in hospitals like it should be.

Efforts in the United States and South Korea have sought to automate risk assessment and classification by training machine learning models on electronic health records.

=== Redistribution of pressure ===
An important aspect of care for most people at risk for pressure ulcers and those with bedsores is the redistribution of pressure so that no pressure is applied to the pressure ulcer. In the 1940s Ludwig Guttmann introduced a program of turning paraplegics every two hours thus allowing bedsores to heal. Previously such individuals had a two-year life-expectancy, normally succumbing to blood and skin infections. Guttmann had learned the technique from the work of Boston physician Donald Munro. There is lack of evidence on prevention of pressure ulcer whether the patient is put in 30 degrees position or at the standard 90 degrees position.

Nursing homes and hospitals usually set programs in place to avoid the development of pressure ulcers in those who are bedridden, such as using a routine time frame for turning and repositioning to reduce pressure. The frequency of turning and repositioning depends on the person&#x27;s level of risk.

Various interventions have been developed to redistribute pressure including the use of different bed mattresses, support surfaces, and the use of static chairs.

==== Support surfaces ====
The use of different types of mattresses including high density foam, surfaces with reactive fibers or gels in them, and surfaces that incorporate reactive water are sometimes suggested to redistribute pressure. The evidence supporting these interventions and whether they prevent new ulcers, increase the comfort level, or have other positive or more negative adverse effects is weak. Many support surfaces redistribute pressure by immersing and/or enveloping the body into the surface. Some support surfaces, including antidecubitus mattresses and cushions, contain multiple air chambers that are alternately pumped. Methods to standardize the products and evaluate the efficacy of these products have only been developed in recent years through the work of the S3I within NPUAP.

There is some evidence that the use of foam mattresses is not as effective as support approaches that include alternating pressure air surfaces or reactive surfaces. It is not clear if interventions that include a reactive air surface are more effective than reactive surfaces that include water or gel or other substrates. In addition, the effectiveness of sheepskin overlays on top of mattresses is not clear.

Static chairs (as opposed to wheelchairs) have also been suggested for pressure redistribution. Static chairs can include: standard hospital chairs; chairs with no cushions or manual/dynamic function; and chairs with integrated pressure redistributing surfaces and recline, rise or tilt functions. More research is needed to establish how effective pressure redistributing static chairs are for preventing pressure ulcers.

For individuals with limited mobility, pressure shifting on a regular basis and using a wheelchair cushion featuring pressure relief components can help prevent pressure wounds.

===Nutrition===
The benefits of nutritional interventions with various compositions for pressure ulcer prevention are uncertain.
The International Guideline on Pressure Injury Prevention and Treatment lists evidence-based recommendations for prevention of pressure injury and their treatment.

=== Organisational changes ===
There is some suggestion that organisational changes may reduce incidence of pressure ulcers, with healthcare professionals central to the prevention of pressure ulcers in both hospital and community settings. It is not clear from studies on the effectiveness of these approaches as to the best organisational change that would benefit those at risk of pressure ulcers including organisation of health services, risk assessment tools, wound care teams, and education. This is largely due to the lack of high-quality research in these areas.

=== Wound care and dressings ===
Caring for wounds and ulcers that have been started and the use of creams are also considerations in preventing worsening to ulcers and new primary ulcers. It is unclear if creams containing fatty acids are effective in reducing incidence of pressure ulcers compared to creams without fatty acids. It is also unclear if silicone dressings reduce pressure ulcer incidence. There is no evidence that massage reduces pressure ulcer incidence. Controlling the heat and moisture levels of the skin surface, known as skin microclimate management, may also play a role in the prevention and control of pressure ulcers. Skin care is also important because damaged skin does not tolerate pressure. However, skin that is damaged by exposure to urine or stool is not considered a pressure ulcer. These skin wounds should be classified as Incontinence Associated Dermatitis.

==Treatment==
Recommendations to treat pressure ulcers include the use of bed rest, pressure redistributing support surfaces, nutritional support, repositioning, wound care (e.g. debridement, wound dressings) and biophysical agents (e.g. electrical stimulation). Reliable scientific evidence to support the use of many of these interventions, though, is lacking. More research is needed to assess how to best support the treatment of pressure ulcers, for example by repositioning.
===Debridement===

Necrotic tissue should be removed in most pressure ulcers. The heel is an exception in many cases when the limb has an inadequate blood supply. Necrotic tissue is an ideal area for bacterial growth, which has the ability to greatly compromise wound healing. There are five ways to remove necrotic tissue.
# Autolytic debridement is the use of moist dressings to promote autolysis with the body&#x27;s own enzymes and white blood cells. It is a slow process, but mostly painless, and is most effective in individuals with a properly functioning immune system.
# Biological debridement, or maggot debridement therapy, is the use of medical maggots to feed on necrotic tissue and therefore clean the wound of excess bacteria. Although this fell out of favor for many years, in January 2004, the FDA approved maggots as a live medical device.
# Chemical debridement, or enzymatic debridement, is the use of prescribed enzymes that promote the removal of necrotic tissue.
# Mechanical debridement, is the use of debriding dressings, whirlpool or ultrasound for slough in a stable wound.
# Surgical debridement, or sharp debridement, is the fastest method, as it allows a surgeon to quickly remove dead tissue.

===Dressings===
It is not clear if one topical agent or dressing is better than another for treating pressure ulcers. There is some evidence to suggest that protease-modulating dressings, foam dressings or collagenase ointment may be better at healing than gauze. The wound dressing should be selected based on the wound and condition of the surrounding skin. There are some studies that indicate that antimicrobial products that stimulate the epithelization may improve the wound healing. However, there is no international consensus on the selection of the dressings for pressure ulcers. Evidence supporting the use of alginate dressings, foam dressings, and hydrogel dressings, and the benefits of these dressings over other treatments is unclear.

Some guidelines for dressing are:
=== Other treatments ===
Other treatments include anabolic steroids, medical grade honey, negative pressure wound therapy, phototherapy, pressure relieving devices, reconstructive surgery, support surfaces, ultrasound and topical phenytoin. There is little or no evidence to support or refute the benefits of most of these treatments compared to each other and placebo. It is not clear if electrical stimulation is an effective treatment for pressure ulcers. In addition, the benefit of using systemic or topical antibiotics in the management of pressure ulcer is still unclear. When selecting treatments, consideration should be given to patients&#x27; quality of life as well as the interventions&#x27; ease of use, reliability, and cost. The benefits of nutritional interventions with various compositions for pressure ulcer treatment are uncertain.

==Prognosis==
==Epidemiology==
Each year, more than 2.5 million people in the United States develop pressure ulcers. In acute care settings in the United States, the incidence of bedsores is 0.4% to 38%; within long-term care it is 2.2% to 23.9%, and in home care, it is 0% to 17%. Similarly, there is wide variation in prevalence: 10% to 18% in acute care, 2.3% to 28% in long-term care, and 0% to 29% in home care. There is a much higher rate of bedsores in intensive care units because of immunocompromised individuals, with 8% to 40% of those in the ICU developing bedsores. However, pressure ulcer prevalence is highly dependent on the methodology used to collect the data. Using the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) methodology there are similar figures for pressure ulcers in acutely sick people in the hospital. There are differences across countries, but using this methodology, pressure ulcer prevalence in Europe was consistently high, from 8.3% (Italy) to 22.9% (Sweden). A recent study in Jordan also showed a figure in this range. Some research shows differences in pressure-ulcer detection among white and black residents in nursing homes.

<doc id="902763" wikidata="Q2719763" url="?curid=902763" title="Limited atonement">
<text>Limited atonement (also called definite atonement or particular redemption) is a doctrine accepted in some Christian theological traditions. It is particularly associated with the Reformed tradition and is one of the five points of Calvinism. The doctrine states that though the death of Jesus Christ is sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world, it was the intention of God the Father that the atonement of Christ&#x27;s death would work itself out in only the elect, thereby leading them without fail to salvation. According to Limited Atonement, Christ died for the sins of the elect alone, and no atonement was provided for the reprobate. This is in contrast to a belief that God&#x27;s prevenient grace (or &quot;enabling grace&quot;) enables all to respond to the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ so that it is each person&#x27;s decision and response to God&#x27;s grace that determines whether Christ&#x27;s atonement will be effective to that individual. A modified form of the doctrine also exists in Molinism.

==History==

The second century document Martyrdom of Polycarp said that Christ &quot;suffered for the world of the saved&quot;, which can be interpreted to support an idea like limited atonement, however it is not certain to teach a form of particular redemption and the book can also be understood in other ways, which do not necessate the view of limited atonement.

The elements of the doctrine to be known as limited atonement were held by Gottschalk of Orbais (c. 808 – c. 867), Thomas Bradwardine (c. 1290 – 1349), and Gregory of Rimini (c. 1300 – 1358), though there was less precision regarding the extent of the atonement before the Reformation period.

The Synod of Dort was convened in 1618 in order to decide a controversy between the followers of Jacobus Arminius (Arminians), and other Calvinists. One of the issues involved had to do with the reason for the limitation of the efficacy of Christ&#x27;s satisfaction for sin (roughly, atonement). Both sides of the controversy agreed that this efficacy was limited to the elect. The disagreement had to do with the grounds for this limitation. For Arminius, the ground was the free choice of people to believe, foreknown by God, with God predestining people based on this foreseen faith. For the opponents of Arminius, whose views are represented in the Canons of Dort, this efficacy was limited based on God&#x27;s predestination, without any foreknowledge of human choice. Calvin clearly taught this second view, and it is also the view of Reformed theologians following the Synod of Dort.

The doctrine of limited atonement also includes the claim that the purpose for which Jesus gave his life was limited to the elect - the &quot;atonement&quot; is &quot;limited&quot; in its purpose. For this reason, the so-called &quot;four-point Calvinists&quot;, such as the 17th century English Puritan Richard Baxter, reject the doctrine of limited atonement and instead believe that the atonement is available to all who will believe in Christ. They also argue that it was never endorsed by Calvin or the Synod of Dort. They refer to both Calvin&#x27;s claim that &quot;It is also a fact, without controversy, that Christ came to atone for the sins &#x27;of the whole world&#x27;&quot; and to Article 3 of the Second Main Point of Doctrine of the Synod of Dort which states that &quot;This death of God&#x27;s Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world.&quot;. Others, however, claim that Calvin and the Canons of Dort are somewhat vague on this issue and accept the claim of limited atonement that the efficacy of his death was limited both in purpose and scope to the elect, though they believe his death was sufficient payment for the sin of the whole world.

With regard to the limited purpose or intent of the atonement to save only the elect, another argument was put forth later in the 17th century. Moses Amyraut and several others (Amyraldists) proposed a system called hypothetical universalism, which taught that in God&#x27;s decree for Christ to be a sufficient atonement for all sin, his intention was to save all on condition that they believe. This decree was prior to his decree to elect some people for whom the atonement was to be efficacious, and so the efficacy of the atonement was still limited to the elect. Most of the Reformed rejected this view because it envisioned a decree of God (the conditional decree to save all) that was intentionally not realized.

== Theology ==

The doctrine of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the doctrine of the nature of the atonement. It also has much to do with the general Calvinist view of predestination. Calvinists advocate the satisfaction theory of the atonement, which developed in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury and Thomas Aquinas. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as penal substitution, states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the sins of men—that is, Christ receives the wrath of God for sins and thereby receives in himself the penalty of the sins of men.

The doctrine of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ has taken the penalty of the elect - that Jesus died for those who would believe, so that those for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned as it would be unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.

The Calvinist view of predestination teaches that God created Adam in a state of original righteousness, but he fell into sin and all humanity in him as their federal head. Those elected to salvation were chosen without a view to their faith or good works but by the sovereign will of God.

The Calvinist atonement is called &quot;definite&quot; by some because they believe it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called &quot;limited&quot; in its extent because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, which is to say that no sin is too great to be expiated by Christ&#x27;s sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic (Particular) Baptists, the doctrine was usually known as &quot;particular redemption&quot;, giving its adherents the name Particular Baptists. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in &quot;general&quot; as General Baptists believe.

=== Biblical passages ===

The classic Bible passage cited to prove a limited extent to the atonement is in which Jesus uses shepherding practices as a metaphor for his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would hear his voice and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd&#x27;s voice. In that context, Jesus says, &quot;I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and I lay down my life &quot;for the sheep,&quot;&quot; and he tells the Pharisees that they &quot;do not believe because [they] are not part of [his] flock.&quot; He continues, &quot;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.&quot; Since Calvinists (and many other Christians) believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand John 10 to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way:

# Jesus lays down his life for the sheep.
# Jesus will lose none of his sheep.
# Many people will not receive eternal life.
:Therefore, the Calvinist position is that Jesus did die for everyone, but his atoning death will only save those whom the Father purposed to save.

Additionally, in the high priestly prayer, Jesus prays for the protection and sanctification of those who believed in him, and he explicitly excludes praying for all: &quot;I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.&quot;. Paul instructs the elders in Ephesus &quot;to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood,&quot;[Acts 20:28] and he says in his letter to the same church that &quot;Christ loved the church and gave himself up &quot;for her.&quot;&quot; Likewise, Jesus foreshadows that he will lay down his life &quot;for his friends,&quot; and an angel tells Jesus&#x27; earthly father Joseph that he &quot;will save &quot;His people&quot; from their sins&quot;. Calvinists believe that these passages demonstrate that Jesus died for the church (that is, the elect) only.

Opponents to Calvinism often cite passages such as those below they believe clearly contradict limited atonement:

# Jesus promises that whosoever believes in him has everlasting life. John 3:16
# Peter proclaims that everyone who calls upon Jesus will be saved. 
# God calls all people everywhere to repent. , 
# God desires all people to be saved. 
# Jesus is a ransom for all. 
# Jesus is the propitiation &quot;for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.&quot; 

=== Confessional positions ===

Chapter 3, paragraph 6 of the Westminster Confession of Faith says, &quot;Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.&quot;

The Canons of Dort assert that &quot;This death of God&#x27;s Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world&quot; (Section 2, Article 3). Article 8 of the same section says

For it was the entirely free plan and very gracious will and intention of God the Father that the enlivening and saving effectiveness of his Son&#x27;s costly death should work itself out in all his chosen ones, in order that he might grant justifying faith to them only and thereby lead them without fail to salvation. In other words, it was God&#x27;s will that Christ through the blood of the cross (by which he confirmed the new covenant) should effectively redeem from every people, tribe, nation, and language all those and only those who were chosen from eternity to salvation and given to him by the Father; that he should grant them faith (which, like the Holy Spirit&#x27;s other saving gifts, he acquired for them by his death); that he should cleanse them by his blood from all their sins, both original and actual, whether committed before or after their coming to faith; that he should faithfully preserve them to the very end; and that he should finally present them to himself, a glorious people, without spot or wrinkle.
== Objections to the doctrine ==

Limited atonement is contrasted with the view popularly termed unlimited atonement, which is advocated by Arminian, Methodist, Lutheran, Messianic Jewish, and Roman Catholic theologians (among others) and which says Christ&#x27;s work makes redemption possible for all but certain for none. (This doctrine should not be confused with concepts of universal reconciliation, in which God saves his entire creation). Though Lutherans and Catholics share a similar doctrine of the nature of the atonement with Calvinists, they differ on its extent, whereas Arminians and Methodists generally accept an alternate theory of the nature of the atonement such as the Governmental theory of atonement. The elect in such models are all the people who choose to avail themselves of God&#x27;s gracious offer of salvation through Christ, not a pre-determined group. Thus, these systems place a limit on the efficacy of the atonement rather than on its extent, like Calvinists.

Some have contended that the doctrine of particular redemption implies that Christ&#x27;s sacrifice was insufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world, but Calvinists have universally rejected this notion, instead holding that the value of the atonement is infinite but that God intentionally withholds its efficacious availability only to the elect.

=== Comparison among Protestants ===

This table summarizes three different Protestant beliefs.

In the Lutheran confessions, the Formula of Concord on the article on the doctrine of election states:

The eternal election of God, however, vel praedestinatio (or predestination), that is, God&#x27;s ordination to salvation, does not extend at once over the godly and the wicked, but only over the children of God, who were elected and ordained to eternal life before the foundation of the world was laid, as Paul says, Eph. 1:4. 5: He hath chosen us in Him, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ.

The Canons of Dort, one of the earliest Calvinist confessions, state in the Second Head, Article 8:

[...]it was the will of God that Christ by the blood of the cross, whereby He confirmed the new covenant, should effectually redeem out of every people, tribe, nation, and language, all those, and those only, who were from eternity chosen to salvation and given to Him by the Father;[...]

In contrast, James Arminius states in his works the following:

[...]To these succeeds the fourth decree, by which God decreed to save and damn certain particular persons. This decree has its foundation in the foreknowledge of God, by which he knew from all eternity those individuals who would, through his preventing (&quot;prevenient&quot;) grace, believe, and, through his subsequent grace would persevere, according to the before described administration of those means which are suitable and proper for conversion and faith; and, by which foreknowledge, he likewise knew those who would not believe and persevere.[...]

<doc id="902765" wikidata="Q3630501" url="?curid=902765" title="Asirgarh Fort">
<text>Asirgarh Fort, also called Ahirgarh Fort is an Indian fortress &quot;(qila)&quot; situated in the Satpura Range about north of the city of Burhanpur, in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The fort is said to date to the early 15th-century and commands a pass through the Satpuras connecting the valleys of the Narmada and Tapti rivers, one of the most important routes from northern India to the Deccan, it was known as the &quot;key to the Deccan&quot;. 

== History ==

The Asirgarh fort is said to have been built by a certain Asa Ahir in the early 15th-century. He was murdered by Sultan Nasir Khan of Khandesh and was considered as one of the seven unconquerable forts of India. Faroqis ruled over Khandesh from Asirgarh for more than two centuries.

Nasir Khan&#x27;s descendant Sultan Bahadur Shah (1596–1600) declared his independence and refused to pay homage to the Mughal emperor Akbar and his son Daniyal. Akbar marched towards Burhanpur in 1599 and occupied the city. Akbar then besieged Asirgarh fort and captured it on 17 January 1601 by tricking Bahadur Shah.

During the Second Anglo-Maratha War, on 18October 1803, Company forces took the of Asigarh with a loss of two killed and five wounded. The fort&#x27;s garrison subsequently surrendered on the 21st after the attackers had erected a battery.

Toward the end of the Third Anglo-Maratha War in early 1819, most Maratha forts had been captured by the British, with the lone holdout being Asirgarh Fort, which was under the command of qiladar Jeswant Rao Lar. In March of that year, a massive British contingent laid siege to Asirgarh, capturing and occupying the town next to the fort to serve as a temporary base of operations. The 1,200-strong garrison was subject to constant artillery bombardments before the British launched an assault, which led to the fort&#x27;s capture on 9 April. With the capture of Asirgarh Fort, the British victory in the conflict was complete and all military operations ceased.

== Architecture ==
The architecture of the fort is mainly influenced by the Indian architecture, some parts also show Faroqi and Mughal architecture, an amalgamation of Islamic, Persian, Turkish and Indian styles. There are three man made ponds to provide a water supply.

There is a temple known as Gupteshwar Mahadev Mandir, dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. There is a local legend that Ashwatthama, a character in the Indian epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, used to come to this temple to worship and offer flowers each morning to Lord Shiva.

There is a ruined mosque of faroqi era with minarets known as Asir Masjid inside the Fort. Apart from the Hindu and Muslim architecture, some ruins are of British origin and there are also British graves. This fort has been deserted following the departure of the British.

<text>Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth, also known as Dartmouth, is the naval academy of the United Kingdom and the initial officer training establishment of the Royal Navy. It is located on a hill overlooking the port of Dartmouth, Devon, England. Royal Naval officer training has taken place in Dartmouth since 1863. The buildings of the current campus were completed in 1905. Earlier students lived in two wooden hulks moored in the River Dart. Since 1998, BRNC has been the sole centre for Royal Naval officer training.

==History==
The training of naval officers at Dartmouth dates from 1863, when the wooden hulk was moved from Portland and moored in the River Dart to serve as a base. In 1864, after an influx of new recruits, &quot;Britannia&quot; was supplemented by . Prior to this, a Royal Naval Academy (later Royal Naval College) had operated for more than a century from 1733 to 1837 at Portsmouth, a major naval installation. The original &quot;Britannia&quot; was replaced by the in 1869, which was renamed &quot;Britannia.&quot;

The foundation stone for a new building at the college was laid by King Edward VII in March 1902. Sir Aston Webb designed the shore-based college at Dartmouth, which was built by Higgs and Hill and practically completed in 1905.

From September 1903, officer cadets first entered the Royal Naval College, Osborne, then after two years transferred to Dartmouth, and the first such intake was in September 1905. 

The college was originally known as the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth (RNC). As a Royal Naval shore establishment, it was later known also by the ship name HMS &quot;Britannia (a battleship called operated from 1904 to 1918). The college was renamed HMS Dartmouth in 1953, when the name &quot;Britannia&quot; was given to the newly launched royal yacht . The training ship moored in the River Dart at Sandquay, a &quot;Sandown&quot; class minehunter formerly known as , continues to bear the name Hindostan&quot;. 

Cadets originally joined the Royal Naval College, Osborne, at the age of 13 for two years&#x27; study and work before joining Dartmouth. The Royal Naval College, Osborne closed in 1921.

During the Second World War, after six Focke-Wulf aircraft bombed the College in September 1942, students and staff moved activities to Eaton Hall in Cheshire until the autumn of 1946. Two bombs had penetrated the College&#x27;s main block, causing damage to the quarterdeck and surrounding rooms.

Britannia Royal Naval College became the sole naval college in the United Kingdom following the closures of the Royal Naval Engineering College, Manadon, in 1994 and of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1998.

In 2020, a group of Junior Rates were trained at BRNC to help alleviate added pressure on HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot;, after a surge in recruitment. On 13 August 2020, a troop of 34 Ratings and 130 officers passed out simultaneously for the first time in the history of the Royal Navy. They were followed by a second class of Junior Rates who passed out on 17 December 2020.

==Entry==
Prospective cadets entrants must meet a minimum academic requirement. They then proceed to the Admiralty Interview Board, where they are tested mentally and physically. Several mental aptitude tests are administered, along with a basic physical fitness test and a medical examination. Officer cadets, as they are known until passing out from the college, can join between the ages of 18 and 39. While most cadets join BRNC after finishing university, some join directly from secondary school. The commissioning course is 30 weeks, with Warfare Officers and Aircrew spending a further 19 weeks studying academics at the college. A large contingent of international and Commonwealth students are part of the student body. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary sends its officer cadets to BRNC for a 10-week initial officer training course, before they start at a maritime college.

==Ofsted criticism==
An Ofsted report on BRNC in 2023 described the college as being filled with &quot;rot and mould&quot;. Inspectors also cited unsafe structures, ill-fitting equipment, staff shortages and medical inspection delays. Inspectors noted how windows in some dormitories were boarded over due to rot while &quot;mould is growing on window frames and ceilings&quot;.

Dartmouth was rated by Ofsted as inadequate. Amanda Spielman, Ofsted&#x27;s Chief Inspector, said Dartmouth received the rating due to the poor state of the college&#x27;s infrastructure which was due to &quot;a lack of investment over many decades&quot;.

==Royal cadets==
King George V and King George VI were naval cadets at Dartmouth. The first &quot;significant encounter&quot; between Prince Philip of Greece and the then Princess Elizabeth took place at Dartmouth in July 1939, where Philip was a naval cadet. Charles III and the Duke of York also attended Dartmouth. The Prince of Wales spent a brief period at the College after leaving Sandhurst as part of his training with all three of Britain&#x27;s Armed Forces.

Sheikh Mubarak Ali Yousuf Suoud Al-Sabah, a member of the Royal Family of Kuwait, attended the Royal Navy Young Officer Course at Britannia Royal Naval College in 2002. Sheikh Isa bin Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the eldest son of the Crown Prince of Bahrain, also underwent training at BRNC (including time at sea in RN warships) from 2014 to 2015, prior to commencing active service in the Royal Bahrain Naval Force.

<text>U.S. Route 331 (US 331) is a spur of U.S. Route 31. It currently runs for from Santa Rosa Beach, Florida east of Fort Walton Beach at US 98 to Montgomery, Alabama at US 80 and US 82. Unlike US 131, US 231, and US 431, US 331 never intersects with its &quot;parent&quot; route, US 31; however, the two routes do come within of each other in Montgomery.

==Route description==

===Florida===

U.S. Route 331 begins at U.S. Route 98 in Santa Rosa Beach. From there it runs north towards a long concrete slab bridge over Choctawhatchee Bay.

The bridge ends at Wheeler Point, and the road makes a sharp curve to the northeast where it encounters an intersection with County Road 3280 (CR 3280), and then turns straight north again. Running along the eastern edge of Mallet Bayou, and LaGrange Bayou, the road makes a less drastic northeastern curve at the bridge over Ramsey Branch, and it eventually intersects State Road 20 (SR 20) on the eastern edge of Freeport.

From that point it runs along the eastern edge of Eglin Air Force Base, which includes the Eglin Wildlife Management Area. This territory ends across the street from the intersection of Edgewood Circle. After the intersection with Indian Creek Ranch Road, US 331/SR 83 makes a slight northwest curve to meet the southern end of County Road 278 (Coy Burgess Loop). The road runs straight north from there and becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches the north end of CR 278 just south of the interchange with Interstate 10 (I-10) at exit 85. Immediately afterwards, US 331/SR 83 enters the city of DeFuniak Springs.

Within the city, US 331/SR 83 remains a divided highway running in the same trajectory, where the only intersection of any level of importance is CR 280(Bob Sikes Road). After the intersection with Myrtle Avenue, it takes another slight curve to the northeast. Two more local intersections will be encountered before the road runs beneath a bridge for the CSX P&amp;A Subdivision, and a parallel bridge with Baldwin Avenue just before the intersection with U.S. Route 90, where both U.S. Route 331 and SR 83 split into two separate concurrencies; US 331 turns left while SR 83 turns right. US 90/331 curves northwest where it encounters the western terminus of Baldwin Avenue, the very city street it crosses under on the north side of the P&amp;A Subdivision. After this it runs along the same railroad line where it encounters the DeFuniak Springs Country Club, but at the eastern edge of DeFuniak Springs Airport, the concurrency ends as US 90 heads west towards Pensacola, while US 331 turns north onto the two-lane hidden SR 187.

The newly independent US 331 runs straight north for one mile. Shortly after the intersection of Walton Road, US 331 curves slightly to the northwest. This trajectory continues for 1.7 miles until it curves more to the northwest just before the intersection with the western terminus of Sunrise Road which leads to CR 1883. From that point it runs north of Holly Lake and then King Lake, and soon after this serves as the northern terminus of a local street named King Lane Road which leads to a local campground. Continuing in the same direction, the road passes more local dead end streets before crossing a bridge over Gum Creek. then climbs a small hill as it passes by an abandoned farm field and later a dirt road named Andrews Road before approaching the western terminus of CR 192, which also shares an intersection with Doctor Nelson Road.

Entering Liberty the road descends slightly into a minimal valley and begins to curve more westerly after passing by the First Baptist Church, then crosses a bridge over Middle Creek. After the bridge it passes a local dirt road named Harrison Drive. Most of the road is surrounded by forestland, but the woods on the southwest side are thinner because the obstruct some local farmland, interrupted by the clearing for another church on the southwest side of the road. Next door is a local gas station and convenience store, which is across the street from one of three private houses on the northeast corner of the west end of County Road 1084. One more church can be found on the southwest side of the road before it crosses over another bridge over Big Swamp Creek, and another bridge over the Bee Branch between South Hall Road and Williams Road before it starts to curve back to the northwest. The road maintains the same relative trajectory as it passes some farmland and local dead end streets, After passing under a power line right-of-way, US 331 encounters the first intersection and south end of a concurrency with County Road 2, a former segment of State Road 2. Just north of that intersection on the opposite side is the eastern terminus of County Road 2A. Later the road curves around another pond into another angle further to the northwest. The telephone poles along the east side of the street veer off into the woods along a former segment of the road just south of the end of the concurrency with CR 2, after which the road turns straight north. However the straight trajectory doesn&#x27;t last as long as one might expect as the road curves slightly to the right south of the shared intersection with South Suttles Road and the abandoned Pittman Road and then runs between two ponds before curving back to the left in order to cross a bridge over Long Creek. North of the bridge, it enters Gordon, where it encounters two county roads along the east side, specifically the western terminus of County Road 0605 (Jackson Still Cutoff) and then the southern terminus of County Road 285 which leads to Britton Hill, the highest natural point in the State of Florida.

The road enters the Town of Paxton along some farm fields on both sides of the road, and the first intersection is a private driveway leading northeast to a house on the other side of Quiet Lake. The next intersection is a dirt road to the southwest named Wain Huckabee Road. Only when it approaches a water tower on the grounds of the Ellis Agricultural Field Airport does US 331 get close to a moderately important intersection, specifically the intersection of County Road 147 (Webster Lane), which despite being an odd-numbered route spans west to east from SR 85 west of Paxton to CR 285 north of Britton Hill. Despite being in an incorporated community, the surroundings of US 331 remain relatively agricultural with exceptions of farm-related businesses, and some random schools, churches, residences, local stores, and even the Town Hall, the vicinity of which actually contains a center left-turn lane. US 331 actually begins to curve straight north again between the intersections of South end of Vann Circle and Clear Springs Road and the north end of Vann Circle where it will remain throughout the rest of the state. The last two intersections in Florida are with another loop street, albeit a deformed one named Geohagan Circle. US 331 crosses the Florida-Alabama State line entering Florala, where SR 187 terminates, Alabama State Route 9 begins, and the road itself momentarily becomes a four-lane undivided highway.

===Alabama===
Once crossing the state line, US 331 immediately enters Florala, where it starts a concurrency with Alabama State Route 54 (SR 54) on the east side of town. The highway continues into downtown Florala, where SR 55 joins the concurrency (this intersection serves as a terminus for SR 54).

US 331 continues northward to Opp, where it becomes concurrent with US 84 as a bypass around the eastern side of town. A business route of US 331 continues northward through town and rejoins US 331 north of Opp, just after US 84 leaves the concurrency with US 331. The highway then continues northward and enters Crenshaw County. It keeps north and into the town of Brantley, where US 29 forms a concurrency with US 331.

The highways continue north into Luverne, where US 29 turns northeast and US 331 turns northwest as they leave town. US 331 soon turns back to the north and passes through several small communities before entering Montgomery County. It passes through several more small communities before entering the southern part of the city of Montgomery. It then intersects the southern bypass of the city (US 80 and US 82). This intersection serves as the northern terminus for US 331.

==History==
The original version of US 331 traveled along what is now U.S. Route 29 south of Flomaton, Alabama between 1926 and 1936. The current version was revived in 1953.

Beginning in 1956, signs for U.S. Highways in Florida had different colors for each highway. The shield for US 331 was green with white lettering and outline, until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and-white signs in 1993.

Until 2007, US 331/SR 83 turned left at State Road 20 in Florida in a short concurrency until it reached Madison Street, then traveled north past Owl&#x27;s Head Road just south of Eglin Air Force Base.

<text>Irresistible grace (also called effectual grace, effectual calling, or efficacious grace) is a doctrine in Christian theology particularly associated with Calvinism, which teaches that the saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has determined to save (the elect) and, in God&#x27;s timing, overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to faith in Christ. It is to be distinguished from prevenient grace, particularly associated with Arminianism, which teaches that the offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method, but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied.

==The doctrine==
Some claim that fourth-century Church Father Augustine of Hippo taught that God grants those whom he chooses for salvation the gift of persevering grace, and that they could not conceivably fall away. This doctrine gave rise to the doctrine of irresistible grace (&quot;gratia irresistibilis&quot;), though the term was not used during Augustine&#x27;s lifetime.

According to Calvinism, those who obtain salvation do so, not by their own &quot;free&quot; will, but because of the sovereign grace of God. That is, men yield to grace, not finally because their consciences were more tender or their faith more tenacious than that of other men. Rather, the willingness and ability to do God&#x27;s will are evidence of God&#x27;s own faithfulness to save men from the power and the penalty of sin, and since man is dead in sin and a slave to it, he cannot decide or be wooed to follow after God: God must powerfully intervene by giving him life and irresistibly drawing the sinner to himself. In short, Calvinism argues that regeneration must precede faith. In contrast, Arminianism argues that God’s grace through Jesus Christ stirs up a willingness to know God and respond to the gospel before regeneration; it is how God intervenes that separates Calvinism from Arminianism.

Calvin says of this intervention that &quot;it is not violent, so as to compel men by external force; but still it is a powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, which makes men willing who formerly were unwilling and reluctant.&quot; Despite the denial by Calvin and within the Calvinist confessions John Gill says that &quot;this act of drawing is an act of power, yet not of force; God in drawing of unwilling, makes willing in the day of His power: He enlightens the understanding, bends the will, gives an heart of flesh, sweetly allures by the power of His grace, and engages the soul to come to Christ, and give up itself to Him; he draws with the bands of love. Drawing, though it supposes power and influence, yet not always coaction and force: music draws the ear, love the heart, and pleasure the mind.&quot;

===Objections to the doctrine===

====Arminian====
Christians associated with Arminianism, such as John Wesley and part of the Methodist movement, reject this Calvinist doctrine. They believe that as Adam and Eve were free to choose between right and wrong, humanity is able, as a result of the prevenient or preceding grace of God through Jesus Christ, to choose to turn from sin to righteousness and believe on Jesus Christ who draws all of humanity to himself. &quot;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.&quot; In this view, (1) after God&#x27;s universal dispensation of grace to mankind, the will of man, which was formerly adverse to God and unable to obey, can now choose to obey through the work of Christ; and (2) although God&#x27;s grace is a strong initial catalyst to effect salvation, it is not &quot;irresistible&quot; but may be ultimately resisted and rejected by a human being.

Both Calvinism and Arminianism agree that the question of the resistibility of grace is inexorably bound up with the theological system&#x27;s view of the sovereignty of God. The fundamental question is whether God can allow individuals to accept or reject his grace and yet remain sovereign. If so, then grace can be resistible. If not, then grace must be irresistible. 

This different understanding of sovereignty is often attributed to an improper understanding of total depravity. However, both Calvin and Arminius taught total depravity. Total depravity is expressly affirmed in Article III of the Five articles of Remonstrance. Nevertheless, Calvinist Charles Hodge says, &quot;The (Arminian) and (Roman Catholic) doctrine is true, if the other parts of their doctrinal system are true; and it is false if that system be erroneous. If the (Calvinistic) doctrine concerning the natural state of man since the fall, and the sovereignty of God in election, be Scriptural, then it is certain that sufficient grace does not become efficacious from the cooperation of the human will.&quot; Hodge&#x27;s argument follows Calvinist teaching which denies that the work of Jesus Christ empowers humanity to respond to the gospel before regeneration.

Calvinism&#x27;s rejection of prevenient grace leaves humanity in a state of Total Depravity which requires regeneration of an individual before that individual is capable to believe or repent. John the Baptist called all to his baptism for the remission of sins and multitudes responded without regeneration. The New Testament regularly calls individuals to repent and believe with no indication that they had been previously regenerated. The Apostle Peter called the Jews to repent and be converted. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would convict the world of sin. Calvinism&#x27;s response is found in Limited Atonement. So as a result of the Calvinist understanding of God&#x27;s sovereignty, one must conclude that God&#x27;s election does not depend upon any human response, necessitating a belief in (1) both Total Depravity and Unconditional Election, (2) Irresistible Grace rather than Prevenient Grace, and (3) Limited Atonement; if any of these beliefs are rejected, this logic fails.

====Lutheran====

Like Calvinists, Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in which an unconverted or unrepentant person always resists and rejects God and his ways. Even during conversion, the Formula of Concord says, humans resist &quot;the Word and will of God, until God awakens him from the death of sin, enlightens and renews him.&quot; Furthermore, they both see the preaching of the gospel as a means of grace by which God offers salvation.

Calvinists distinguish between a resistible, outward call to salvation given to all who hear the free offer of the gospel, and an efficacious, inward work by the Holy Spirit. Every person is unwilling to follow the outward call to salvation until, as the Westminster Confession puts it, &quot;being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed by it.&quot; Once inwardly renewed, every person freely follows God and his ways as &quot;not only the obligatory but the preferable good,&quot; and hence that special renewing grace is always effective.

Contrary to the Calvinist position, Lutherans hold that whenever the Holy Spirit works outwardly through the Word and sacraments, it always acts inwardly through them as well. Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans believe the Holy Spirit always works efficaciously. The Word heard by those that resist it is just as efficacious as the Word preached to those that convert. The Formula of Concord teaches that when humans reject the calling of the Holy Spirit, it is not a result of the Word being less efficacious. Instead, contempt for the means of grace is the result of &quot;the perverse will of man, which rejects or perverts the means and instrument of the Holy Ghost, which God offers him through the call, and resists the Holy Ghost, who wishes to be efficacious, and works through the Word...&quot;

Lutherans are certain that the work of the Holy Spirit does not occur merely alongside the means of grace to regenerate, but instead is an integral part of them, always working through them wherever they are found. Lutherans teach that the Holy Spirit limits itself to working only through the means of grace and nowhere else, so that those who reject the means of grace are simultaneously resisting and rejecting the Holy Spirit and the grace it brings.

===Biblical passages related to the doctrine===

The statement of St. Paul is said to confirm that those whom God effectually calls necessarily come to full salvation: &quot;(T)hose whom (God) predestined He also called, and those whom He called He also justified, and those whom He justified He also glorified&quot; (Romans 8:28, 30). Of course, this confirmation depends upon the belief that when God elected certain individuals for salvation, He either did not know or did not consider who would respond and obey, though the Apostle Peter refers to the &quot;Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ&quot;.

Calvinists also rely upon several verses from the sixth chapter of the Gospel of John, which contains a record of Jesus&#x27; teaching on humanity&#x27;s abilities and God&#x27;s activities in salvation, as the central proof text for the Calvinist doctrine:

* John 6:37, 39: &quot;All that the Father gives me will come to me... And this is the will of Him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that He has given me, but raise it up on the last day.&quot;[ESV]
* John 6:44–45: &quot;No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him... Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.&quot;[ESV]
* John 6:65: &quot;(N)o one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.&quot;[ESV]

Proponents of Arminianism argue that the word &quot;draw&quot; (Greek: , &quot;helkô&quot;) as used in John 6:44 does not require the sense of &quot;drag&quot;, though Calvinists teach this is the word&#x27;s usual meaning (as in Jn. 18:10; 21:6; 21:11; Acts 16:19; 21:30; Jas. 2:6). They point to John 12:32 as an example: &quot;And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&quot; Many Arminians interpret this to mean that Jesus draws all people to Himself, but the draw only enables people to come to Him, since, if the call was truly irresistible, then all must come to Christ and be saved. They may also note that in the Septuagint version of Jeremiah 38:13, when Jeremiah is lifted out of the pit where he was left to die, this Greek verb is used for the action which his rescuers performed after he voluntarily secured the ropes under his armpits, and that this rescue was performed in cooperation with Jeremiah&#x27;s wishes and would have failed if he did not cooperate. Therefore, they may argue, even if the semantics of &quot;draw&quot; are understood in the usual sense, this should only be taken to indicate the source of the power, not the question of whether the person being drawn responds to the drawing, or to indicate that the drawing is done irrespective of their will.

Calvinists argue that (1) the word &quot;draw&quot; should be understood according to its usual semantics in both John 6:44 and 12:32; (2) the word &quot;all&quot; (translated &quot;all people&quot; in verse 12:32) should be taken in the sense of &quot;all kinds of people&quot; rather than &quot;every individual&quot;; and thus (3) the former verse refers to an irresistible internal call to salvation and the latter to the opening of the Kingdom of God to the Gentiles, not a universal, resistible internal call. The argument requires acceptance of either the doctrine of Limited Atonement or universalism, since John 12:32 states that &quot;Jesus will draw all&quot;. Some have asserted on this basis that the text of John 6:44 can entail either universalism or Calvinism (inclusive of Limited Atonement), but not Arminianism.

Arminian William Barclay argues that &quot;man&#x27;s resistance can defeat the pull of God&quot; mentioned in John 6:44, but commentator Leon Morris contends that &quot;(n)ot one of (Barclay&#x27;s) examples of the verb (&#x27;draw&#x27;) shows the resistance as successful. Indeed we can go further. There is not one example in the New Testament of the use of this verb where the resistance is successful. Always the drawing power is triumphant, as here.&quot; Such arguments invite the criticism that Calvinists teach salvation by decree of God rather than justification by faith alone, that they &quot;so zealously sought to guard the free grace of God in salvation that they denied faith any involvement at all in the actual justification of sinners.&quot; But even if the drawing power is always triumphant, the ability to resist does not depend upon the meaning of the word &quot;draw&quot; in John 12:32, but on the question what the &quot;draw&quot; is intended to accomplish. Calvinism assumes that persons who Jesus &quot;draws&quot; will be regenerated. Arminianism states that all are drawn to Jesus to be given an enabling grace. &quot;Jesus does not define what &#x27;His drawing&#x27; will accomplish in John 12, only that He will do it.&quot; Even if the semantics of &quot;draw&quot; are understood in the manner Calvinist&#x27;s urge, this should only be taken to indicate the sufficiency of the power to draw (they were &quot;not able to draw&quot; as in John 21:6, or they were able to do so as in John 21:11), rather than to define what God does to those He draws. Arminians reject the Calvinist teaching that God draws for the purpose of forced regeneration irrespective of their wishes. Rather Arminians believe God draws all persons to provide all with an ability or enabling to believe, as prevenient grace teaches.

==History of the doctrine==
In the Catholic Church, debates concerning the respective role of efficacious grace and free will led to the establishment of the Congregatio de Auxiliis at the end of the 16th century by the Pope Clement VIII. The Dominicans insisted on the role of the efficacious grace, but the Jesuits embraced Molinism, which postulated greater liberty in the will. These debates also led to the famous formulary controversy in France which pitted the Jansenists against the Jesuits.

The doctrine is one of the so-called Five points of Calvinism that were defined at the Synod of Dort during the Quinquarticular Controversy with the Arminian Remonstrants, who objected to the general predestinarian scheme of Calvinism, rejecting its denial of free will and its condemnation of the &quot;majority of humanity for the sole purpose of torturing them in hell for all of eternity, and that they never had a choice&quot;. In Calvinist churches, the doctrine is most often mentioned in comparisons with other salvific schemes and their respective doctrines about the state of mankind after the Fall, and it is not a common topic for sermons or studies otherwise.

<text>U.S. Route 431 (US 431) is a spur of U.S. Route 31. It currently travels for approximately from US 231/Alabama State Route 210 and US 231 Business (US 231 Bus.) and US 431 Bus. in Dothan, Alabama, to Owensboro, Kentucky, at US 60 and Kentucky Route 2831. The major cities US 431 connects to (from south to north) are Dothan and Huntsville, Alabama, Franklin and Nashville, Tennessee, and Owensboro, Kentucky.

==Route description==
===Alabama===
U.S. 431 is paired with unsigned State Route1 throughout almost all of Alabama, with the exception of Dothan, where it is paired with signed State Route 210 around the eastern portion of the bypass named Ross Clark Circle. There is also a business route through downtown Dothan signed as Business US 431 and locally known as Reeves Street which runs into Business US 231. The two routes are signed concurrently through downtown and known locally as N. Oates Street north of Main Street (Business US 84) and S. Oates Street south of Main Street. The southern terminus of US 431 is at the intersection of US 231 and the business spurs on the south side of Ross Clark Circle. Along with US 84 and US 231, all three routes form the Ross Clark Circle, which is also a beltway around Dothan while their business routes go through the city, though the beltway is not officially designated as such.

The route takes a rather meandering path through southeast Alabama. It heads in a northeast direction to pass through Phenix City near the Georgia state line, then cuts back to the west to pass through Opelika; the portion between Phenix City and Opelika is concurrent with U.S. Route 280. From Opelika, US 431 swings back and forth between northwest and northeast as it works its way through the southern extent of the Appalachian Mountains, then turning northwest to pass through Talladega National Forest, arriving at a junction with Interstate 20 a few miles east of Oxford. The combined routes travel westward from Exit 191 into Oxford, where US 431 splits off at Exit 188 and heads northward through Oxford and the adjacent city of Anniston; through this section the route is named Veterans Memorial Parkway.

From Anniston, US 431 heads northwards towards Gadsden. In East Gadsden, it combines with U.S. Route 278; the combined route passes westward through Gadsden and Attalla before splitting just northwest of Attalla. This route is named Meighan Boulevard in Gadsden and Fifth Avenue in Attalla until reaching US 11. In downtown Attalla, the route shares a brief wrong-way concurrency with US 11. West of Attalla, US 431 again turns to the northwest. At Guntersville, it joins with Alabama State Route 79. Through downtown Guntersville the route is divided into two separate one-way streets; the northbound street is named Blount Avenue, and the southbound street is Gunter Avenue. At the northern edge of Guntersville, the split streets combine and the joint route crosses the Tennessee River via the George S. Houston Bridge, before US 431 splits off and again heads in a northwest direction.

At Huntsville, US 431 passes over Monte Sano Mountain and through Huntsville&#x27;s medical district before reaching Memorial Parkway; this portion of the route forms a portion of Governors Drive. At the Parkway, the route joins with U.S. Route 231; the combined routes then travel northward to the Tennessee state line.

===Tennessee===


A few miles north of the state line, in Fayetteville, US 231 and 431 split again, with 431 heading northwest in combination with State Route 50. In the town of Petersburg, the combined route briefly joins with State Route 129; the trio head a few miles northwest before SR-129 splits off to the west. From here, US 431/SR 50 travels through mountainous and largely undeveloped territory in south central Tennessee until arriving in Lewisburg. On the east side of Lewisburg, it joins with U.S. Route 31A; the combined routes form part of a bypass around the eastern side of Lewisburg. This portion is named Ellington Parkway, and it forms brief unions with State Routes 272 and 11, plus a longer-lasting combination with State Route 106. Meanwhile, SR 50 splits off to travel through downtown Lewisburg, rejoining US 431 on the north side of town.

On the north side of Lewisburg, US 31A splits off, and then a few miles later SR-50 splits off, while US 431 and SR-106 jointly continue north. The route pair, variously known through this section as Lewisburg Pike or Franklin Pike, eventually passes underneath Interstate 65 to enter the town of Franklin. Continuing north, the route pair passes through the exclusive Nashville subdivision of Brentwood before entering Nashville proper. The route skirts the campus of Vanderbilt University before entering downtown Nashville from the southwest. Crossing under Interstate 40 (where SR-106 ends), the route follows Broadway to its intersection with Rosa L. Parks Boulevard. Here the route makes a left turn towards the northwest, joining with U.S. Route 31 and U.S. Route 41 and several state routes. The route snakes around the state capitol and crosses the Cumberland River going northwest as James Robertson Parkway. In east Nashville, the route crosses under Interstate 24, then follows Spring Street and then Dickerson Pike northward.

At Whites Creek Pike, US 431 splits off from the other routes, heading westward back across north Nashville and then north out of Nashville. In combination with State Route 65, it heads to Springfield, where it again joins with US-41 and SR-11. The combined routes pass north through Springfield, and then US-431/SR-65 split off and head north to the Kentucky state line.

===Kentucky===

U.S. 431 enters Kentucky south of Adairville, where it runs north into Russellville. It continues through Russellville northbound where many new re-construction projects have widened it to a four-lane highway. U.S. 431 continues its northward journey passing through many small towns when it enters Drakesboro, after which it follows most of its original route into Central City. In Central City, U.S. 431 has a cloverleaf intersection (a former toll plaza when the parkway was toll) with the Western Kentucky Parkway. The route continues north and intersects with U.S. 62 where it then parallels the route in a westerly direction to a western bypass around the central business district of Central City, in which city it is named in honor of the Everly Brothers, locally-born prominent singers. U.S. 431 turns north at the Kentucky Route 189 and U.S. 62 bypass and continues on through many small farming communities of Muhlenberg and McLean counties. After bisecting many rural rolling hills and farms of the Western Coal Fields as well as crossing through river lowlands of the Ohio Valley on its journey to Daviess County, it enters the city of Owensboro as a four-lane highway and one of the main arterial roads into the city. Many shopping centers line its outer reaches in Owensboro.

As of mid-2010, U.S. 431 now officially terminates at the former US 60 By-Pass (Wendell H. Ford Expressway) on Owensboro&#x27;s south side, following AASHTO&#x27;s approval of Kentucky&#x27;s renumbering of the US 60 By-Pass as simply U.S. 60. The former route of U.S. 60 through downtown Owensboro (Second and Fourth streets) is to be turned over to the city and made more &quot;pedestrian-friendly&quot; as part of the city&#x27;s latest downtown revitalization plan.

In early 2011, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet renumbered the former section of U.S. 431 from US 60 to Fifth Street in Owensboro as Kentucky Route 2831.

A small portion of U.S. 431 is famous for a unique reason. U.S. 431 crosses the Green River in McLean County, Kentucky. It is at that crossing in the city of Livermore that U.S. 431 crosses two rivers and also crosses into Ohio County before completing the river crossing back in McLean County. This is the only known crossing of this type in the United States: a road starts in one county, crosses two separate rivers, crosses a sliver of land within another county, and then terminates the bridge crossing in the original county it started in. This special feature is marked by a state historical marker on both approach ends of the bridge.
==History==
===Original U.S. Route 241===
U.S. Route 241 (US 241) was formed in 1930. It went from US 231 in Dothan, Alabama to US 41 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The route of the highway went north from Phenix City to Opelika. From there, it traveled north through Alexander City, Goodwater, Sylacauga, and Talladega before entering Oxford. It also went north through Anniston, Gadsden, Boaz, Albertville and Guntersville (on what is now SR 205). It then went through New Hope, and Owens Cross Roads (on a road currently named &quot;Old Highway 431&quot;) before reaching its former northern terminus in Huntsville. Around 1952, the terminus was truncated and the route was extended north, entering Tennessee and went through Fayetteville and ended up in Shelbyville.

In 1953, US 241 was decommissioned. However, since US 431 was being extended northward from Alabama and into Tennessee and Kentucky. The lost section from Oxford to Huntsville gained the US 431 designation. The route was then later redesignated along SR 37 route, through Opelika, Alexander, Goodwater, Sylacauga, and Talladega. However, the Sylacauga to Opelika section of the original highway did gain the US 280 designation. From Opelika to Phenix City, the final section of the decommissioned US 241 gained the US 431 designation.

===Kentucky Route===
US 431 from South Carrollton to Owensboro was originally signed as Kentucky Route 75 (KY 75) from its 1929 establishment until US 431 replaced the designation in 1953. KY 81 was also once designated to travel on US 431&#x27;s course from South Carrollton to the Tennessee state line until 1953. In Central City, the highway was rerouted from its original alignment to the former Kentucky Route 189 bypass. The original alignment is now designated as Kentucky Route 1031. In the city of Russellville, the original alignment was redesignated to Kentucky Route 3519 in the mid-2000s and US 431 was rerouted onto the northwest quadrant of the Russellville Bypass.

<text>The Funnel(-neck-)beaker culture, in short TRB or TBK (, ; ; ), was an archaeological culture in north-central Europe. 
It developed as a technological merger of local neolithic and mesolithic techno-complexes between the lower Elbe and middle Vistula rivers. These predecessors were the (Danubian) Lengyel-influenced Stroke-ornamented ware culture (STK) groups/Late Lengyel and Baden-Boleráz in the southeast, Rössen groups in the southwest and the Ertebølle-Ellerbek groups in the north. The TRB introduced farming and husbandry as major food sources to the pottery-using hunter-gatherers north of this line.

The TRB techno-complex is divided into a northern group including Northern Germany and southern Scandinavia (TRB-N, roughly the area that previously belonged to the Ertebølle-Ellerbek complex), a western group in the Netherlands between the Zuiderzee and lower Elbe that originated in the Swifterbant culture, an eastern group centered on the Vistula catchment, roughly ranging from Oder to Bug, and south-central groups (TRB-MES, Altmark) around the middle and upper Elbe and Saale. Especially in the southern and eastern groups, local sequences of variants emerged. In the late 4th millennium BCE, the Globular Amphora culture (GAC) replaced most of the eastern and subsequently also the southern TRB groups, reducing the TRB area to modern northern Germany and southern Scandinavia.

The younger TRB in these areas was superseded by the Single Grave culture (EGK) at about 2800 BCE. 
The north-central European megaliths were built primarily during the TRB era.

==Nomenclature==
The Funnelbeaker culture is named for its characteristic ceramics, beakers and amphorae with funnel-shaped tops, which were found in dolmen burials.

==History==

The Funnelbeaker culture emerged in northern modern-day Germany . Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that it originated through a migration of colonists from the Michelsberg culture of Central Europe. The Michelsberg culture is archaeologically and genetically strongly differentiated from the preceding post-Linear Pottery cultures of Central Europe, being distinguished by increased levels of hunter-gatherer ancestry. Its people were probably descended from farmers migrating into Central Europe out of Iberia and modern-day France, who in turn were descended from farmers of the Cardial Ware cultures who had migrated westwards from the Balkans along the Mediterranean coast. Connections between the Funnelbeakers and these farmers of the Atlantic coast is supported by genetic evidence.

After its establishment, the Funnelbeaker culture rapidly spread into southern Scandinavia and Poland, in what appears to have been a well-organized colonizing venture. In southern Scandinavia it replaced the Ertebølle culture, which had maintained a Mesolithic lifestyle for about 1500 years after farming arrived in Central Europe. The emergence of the Neolithic British Isles through maritime colonization by Michelsberg-related groups occurred almost at the same time as the expansion of the Funnelbeaker culture into Scandinavia, suggesting that these events may be connected. Although they were largely of Early European Farmer (EEF) descent, people of the Funnelbeaker culture had a relatively high amount of hunter-gatherer admixture, particularly in Scandinavia, suggesting that hunter-gatherer populations were partially incorporated into it during its expansion into this region. People of the Funnelbeaker culture often had between 30% and 50% hunter-gatherer ancestry depending on the region.

During later phases of the Neolithic, the Funnelbeaker culture re-expanded out of Scandinavia southwards into Central Europe, establishing several regional varieties. This expansion appears to have been accompanied by significant human migration. The southward expansion of the Funnelbeaker culture was accompanied by a substantial increase in hunter-gatherer lineages in Central Europe. The Funnelbeaker communities in Central Europe which emerged were probably quite genetically and ethnically mixed, and archaeological evidence suggests that they were relatively violent.

From the middle of the 4th millennium BCE, the Funnelbeaker culture was gradually replaced by the Globular Amphora culture on its southeastern fringes, and began to decline in Scandinavia.

In the early 3rd millennium BCE, the Corded Ware culture appeared in Northern Europe. Its peoples were of marked steppe-related ancestry and traced their origins in cultures further east. This period is distinguished by the construction of numerous defensive palisades in Funnelbeaker territory, which may be a sign of violent conflict between the Funnelbeakers, Corded Ware, and Pitted Ware. By 2650 BCE, the Funnelbeaker culture had been replaced by the Corded Ware culture. Genetic studies suggest that Funnelbeaker women were incorporated into the Corded Ware culture through intermixing with incoming Corded Ware males, and that people of the Corded Ware culture continued to use Funnelbeaker megaliths as burial grounds. Subsequent cultures of Late Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age Central Europe display strong maternal genetic affinity with the Funnelbeaker culture.

==Distribution==
The TRB ranges from the Elbe catchment in Germany and Bohemia with a western extension into the Netherlands, to southern Scandinavia (Denmark up to Uppland in Sweden and the Oslofjord in Norway) in the north, and to the Vistula catchment in Poland and the area between Dnister and Western Bug headwaters in Ukraine in the east.

Variants of the Funnelbeaker culture in or near the Elbe catchment area include the Tiefstich pottery group in northern Germany as well as the cultures of the Baalberge group (TRB-MES II and III; MES = Mittelelbe-Saale), the Salzmünde and Walternienburg and Bernburg (all TRB-MES IV) whose centres were in Saxony-Anhalt.

==Characteristics==
===Settlements===

With the exception of some inland settlements such as the Alvastra pile-dwelling, the settlements are located near those of the previous Ertebølle culture on the coast. It was characterized by single-family daubed houses c. 12 m x 6 m.

===Economy===
Studies on plant use at Funnel Beaker sites are biased by the scarcity of sites with waterlogged preservation. Based on analysis from northern Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, the state of the art is that the crop analyses show assemblages that are dominated by Hordeum vulgare var. nudum (naked barley) and Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum (Triticum dicoccum, emmer). Moreover, Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum (Triticum monococcum, einkorn) and Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum and/or Triticum turgidum ssp. durum/turgidum (Triticum aestivum/Triticum turgidum, free-threshing wheat) frequently occur in small quantities. Triticum durum/turgidum (hard/rivet wheat) has been demonstrated at Frydenlund and in Albersdorf.

Oil plants Linum usitatissimum (linseed) and Papaver somniferum ssp. setigerum (opium poppy) occur very scarcely, and mostly from the Middle Neolithic (c. 3300 BCE) onwards. However, Linum and Papaver are probably underrepresented at Funnel Beaker sites. In contrast to starch-rich seeds/fruits, these oil-rich remains easily burn away when in contact with fire.

Wild fruit remains preserved as carbonised remains include e.g. &quot;Corylus avellana&quot; (hazelnut), &quot;Malus sylvestris&quot; (crab apple), &quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot; (common hawthorn) (also found in Wangels), &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot; (blackberry), &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; (raspberry), and &quot;Viscum album&quot; (mistletoe), while use of &quot;Prunus spinosa&quot; (sloe) is suggested by a single imprint.

In a recent paper, scientists from Kiel University (Collaboarative Research Centre 1266) have found that although there are general similarities in used plants, differences in the production are evident. This is shown by two recently investigated sites. In Frydenlund, Funen, Denmark, the grinding stones were used to grind wild plants only. In Oldenburg, Germany, grain was processed. In Frydenlund, the absence of cereal grinding combined and an abundance of carbonised cereals from soil samples indicates that probably grain was processed to a porridge-like meal. In Oldenburg, in contrast, bread (possible flat bread) was produced in addition to porridge.

The Funnelbeaker culture was dominated by animal husbandry of sheep, cattle, pigs and goats, but there was also hunting and fishing.

There was also flint mining (in the Malmö region) and collection of flintstone (Świętokrzyskie Mountains), which was traded into regions lacking the stone, such as the Scandinavian hinterland. Huge flint axes from Denmark or northern Germany were distributed to Dutch groups.

The culture used copper, especially daggers and axes. In contrast to earlier beliefs that the copper originated in the Austian Alps, recent studies established that the early copper (4100-3000 BCE) was mined in Serbian and Bulgarian mines. After this early phase, the number of copper artefacts decrease significantly between 3300 and 2800 BCE and are almost absent between 2800 and 2300 BCE.

===Technology===
The Funnelbeaker Culture preserves the oldest dated evidence of wheeled vehicles in middle Europe. One example is the engraving on a ceramic tureen from Bronocice in Poland on the northern edge of the Beskidy Mountains (northern Carpathian ring), which is indirectly dated to the time span from 3636 to 3373 BCE and is the oldest evidence for covered carriages in Central Europe. They were drawn by cattle, presumably oxen whose remains were found with the pot. Today it is housed in the Archaeological Museum of Cracow (&quot;Muzeum Archeologiczne w Krakowie&quot;), Poland.

The Funnel Beaker Culture is associated with skilfully crafted objects such as flint axes or battle axes.

At Flintbek in northern Germany cart tracks dating from c. 3400 BCE were discovered underneath a megalithic long barrow. This is the earliest known direct evidence for wheeled vehicles in the world (i.e. not models or images).


===Graves===
Houses were centered on a monumental grave, a symbol of social cohesion. Burial practices were varied depending on region and changed over time. Inhumation seems to have been the rule.

The oldest graves consisted of wooden chambered cairns inside long barrows, but were later made in the form of passage graves and dolmens. Originally, the structures were probably covered with a mound of earth and the entrance was blocked by a stone.

Before medieval and modern church building required stone, and before modern land use began, the number of megaliths in northern Germany and southern Scandinavia was much higher than today. In Denmark, 2,800 monuments have been recorded, and about 7,300 other examples existed. In northern Germany, Johannes Müller reports 11,658 known monuments. He assumes that about 75,000 megaliths were originally constructed.

The Funnelbeaker culture marks the appearance of megalithic tombs at the coasts of the Baltic and of the North sea, an example of which are the Sieben Steinhäuser in northern Germany. The megalithic structures of Ireland, France and Portugal are somewhat older and have been connected to earlier archeological cultures of those areas. At graves, the people sacrificed ceramic vessels that contained food along with amber jewelry and flint-axes.

Genetic analysis of several dozen individuals found in the Funnelbeaker passage grave Frälsegården in Sweden suggest that these burials were based on a patrilineal social organisation, with the vast majority of males being ultimately descended from a single male ancestor while the women were mostly unrelated who presumably married into the family.

===Religion===

Flint-axes and vessels were also deposited in streams and lakes near the farmlands, and virtually all of Sweden&#x27;s 10,000 flint axes that have been found from this culture were probably sacrificed in water. They also constructed large cult centres surrounded by pales, earthworks and moats. The largest one is found at Sarup on Fyn. It comprises 85,000 m2 and is estimated to have taken 8000 workdays. Another cult centre at Stävie near Lund comprises 30,000 m2.

==Ethnicity==
In the context of the Kurgan hypothesis (or steppe hypothesis), the culture is seen as non-Indo-European, representing a culture of Neolithic origin, as opposed to the Indo-European-language-speaking peoples (see Yamna culture) who later intruded from the east.

Marija Gimbutas postulated that the political relationship between the aboriginal and intrusive cultures resulted in quick and smooth cultural morphosis into the Corded Ware culture.

In the past, a number of other archaeologists proposed that the Corded Ware culture was a purely local development of the Funnelbeaker culture, but genetic evidence has since demonstrated that this was not the case.

==Gallery==
==Genetics==

Ancient DNA analysis has found the people who produced the Funnelbeaker culture to be genetically different from earlier hunter-gather inhabitants of the region, and are instead closely related to other European Neolithic farmers, who ultimately traced most of their ancestry from early farmers in Anatolia, with some admixture from European hunter-gatherer groups. Genetic analysis suggests that there was some minor gene flow between the producers of the Funnelbeaker culture and those of the hunter-gatherer Pitted Ware culture (which descended from earlier Scandinavian hunter-gather groups) to the north.

A total of 62 males from sites attributed to the Funnelbeaker culture in Scandinavia and Germany have been sequenced for ancient DNA. Most belonged to haplogroup I2 while a smaller number belonged to R1b-V88, Q-FTF30 and G2a. MtDNA haplogroups included U, H, T, R and K.

<text>In economics, neutral goods refers either to goods whose demand is independent of income, or those that have no change on the consumer&#x27;s utility when consumed. 

Under the first definition, neutral goods have substitution effects but not income effects. Examples of this include prescription medicines such as insulin for diabetics. An individual&#x27;s income may vary, but their consumption of vital medicines remains constant.

The second definition says that a good is neutral if the consumer is ambivalent towards its consumption. That is, the consumption of that good neither increases nor decreases the consumer&#x27;s utility. For example, if a consumer likes texting, but is neutral about the data package on his phone contract, then increasing the data allowance does not alter his utility. An indifference curve—constructed with data allowance on the Y axis and text allowance is on the X axis forms a vertical line.

<doc id="902801" wikidata="Q6698793" url="?curid=902801" title="Ludics">
<text>In proof theory, ludics is an analysis of the principles governing inference rules of mathematical logic. Key features of ludics include notion of compound connectives, using a technique known as &quot;focusing&quot; or &quot;focalisation&quot; (invented by the computer scientist Jean-Marc Andreoli), and its use of &quot;locations&quot; or &quot;loci&quot; over a base instead of propositions.

More precisely, ludics tries to retrieve known logical connectives and proof behaviours by following the paradigm of interactive computation, similarly to what is done in game semantics to which it is closely related. By abstracting the notion of formulae and focusing on their concrete uses—that is distinct occurrences—it provides an abstract syntax for computer science, as loci can be seen as pointers on memory.

The primary achievement of ludics is the discovery of a relationship between two natural, but distinct notions of type, or proposition.

The first view, which might be termed the proof-theoretic or Gentzen-style interpretation of propositions, says that the meaning of a proposition arises from its introduction and elimination rules. Focalization refines this viewpoint by distinguishing between positive propositions, whose meaning arises from their introduction rules, and negative propositions, whose meaning arises from their elimination rules. In focused calculi, it is possible to define positive connectives by giving only their introduction rules, with the shape of the elimination rules being forced by this choice. (Symmetrically, negative connectives can be defined in focused calculi by giving only the elimination rules, with the introduction rules forced by this choice.)

The second view, which might be termed the computational or Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation of propositions, takes the view that we fix a computational system up front, and then give a realizability interpretation of propositions to give them constructive content. For example, a realizer for the proposition &quot;A implies B&quot; is a computable function that takes a realizer for A, and uses it to compute a realizer for B. Realizability models characterize realizers for propositions in terms of their visible behavior, and not in terms of their internal structure.

Girard shows that for second-order affine linear logic, given a computational system with nontermination and error stops as effects, realizability and focalization give the same meaning to types.

Ludics was proposed by the logician Jean-Yves Girard. His paper introducing ludics, &quot;Locus solum: from the rules of logic to the logic of rules&quot;, has some features that may be seen as eccentric for a publication in mathematical logic (such as illustrations of skunks). The intent of these features is to enforce the point of view of Jean-Yves Girard at the time of its writing. And, thus, it offers to readers the possibility to understand ludics independently of their backgrounds.

<doc id="902802" wikidata="Q2395580" url="?curid=902802" title="U.S. Route 136">
<text>U.S. Route 136 is an east-west U.S. highway that is a spur route of U.S. Route 36. It runs from Edison, Nebraska, at U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 34 to the Interstate 74/Interstate 465 interchange in Speedway, Indiana. This is a distance of . Due to the removal of almost every numbered route in Indianapolis, US 136 never meets its parent, US 36; however, it does come within two miles of it at its interchange with I-465/I-74 at its eastern terminus.

==Route description==
U.S. 136 passes through the following states:

===Nebraska===

U.S. 136 closely parallels Nebraska&#x27;s southern border from its western terminus near Edison to the Missouri River. It passes through Beatrice and exits the state at Brownville via the Brownville Bridge. It is designated the Heritage Highway throughout Nebraska.

===Missouri===

US 136 enters Missouri on the west just east of Brownville, Nebraska, over the Missouri River. It leaves the state at Alexandria on the east, running concurrently with US 61. During its journey, it enters every county seat in the nine counties it traverses. The distance across Missouri is approximately . US 136 is two lanes over its entire course through Missouri.

===Iowa===

US 136 in Iowa consists of a route which travels across the south-easternmost tip of Lee County. It crosses the Des Moines River from Missouri with US 61, overlapping for just over . East of the US 61 split, US 136 is overlapped by US 61 Bus. through Keokuk. US 136 enters Keokuk along 7th Street, which takes a turn to the northeast towards downtown. At the intersection with Main Street, which is the southern end of US 218, it turns to the southeast towards the Mississippi River. US 136 travels another before crossing the Mississippi into Hamilton, Illinois via the Keokuk–Hamilton Bridge.

===Illinois===

US 136 spends within the state of Illinois. It crosses the Mississippi River into Illinois from Iowa just past Keokuk. It passes through historic Carthage; site of the death of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement and home of the Kibbe biological museum, then Macomb, where Western Illinois University is located. It continues as an east–west route intersecting with I-155 and I-55 south of Bloomington-Normal and north of Lincoln in Central Illinois. It later intersects with I-74, and then I-57 just outside Rantoul, approximately north of Champaign-Urbana. US 136 then travels concurrently with Illinois Route 1 in far east central Illinois before entering Danville. At Danville, it turns east as it passes into Indiana.

===Indiana===

Through most of its duration in Indiana, US 136 is parallel to the newer I-74. Within Indianapolis, the highway is also called Crawfordsville Road, and US 136 ends in the town of Speedway, at the I-74/I-465 interchange, where Crawfordsville Road continues without numbered designation. As part of Indiana&#x27;s Accelerate 465 project, the I-74/I-465 interchange was being reworked to eliminate tight spiral ramps and to add a full interchange for US 136 with I-465. It was completed in 2014. The entire portion of US 136 in Indiana is part of the Dixie Highway.

==History==
In Illinois, the designation of US 136 in 1951 replaced IL 10 from the Iowa state line in Keokuk to IL 119 in Havana, The route then followed IL 119 to an intersection with IL 1, where it traveled south to IL 10, heading east to Danville and the Indiana state line.

In Missouri, most of US 136 was designated as Route 4 in 1922. This highway began at St. Joseph and followed present US 169 to Stanberry, turning east there to the Iowa state line along US 136. The rest of US 136 was initially Route 1A (Nebraska to Rock Port), part of Route 1, and Route 18 (Tarkio to Stanberry). The east end was truncated to Wayland in 1926, when US 61 was designated over the part east to Iowa, and in 1927 Route 4 absorbed the former Route 52 from St. Joseph southwest to Atchison, Kansas. In 1932, Route 4 was rerouted west of Stanberry, absorbing Route 18 and Route 102 (the latter a ca. 1930 renumbering of Route 1A); the portion from Stanberry to St. Joseph was deleted in favor of US 169 and the portion from St. Joseph to Kansas became Route 18 (which became part of US 59 in 1934). US 136 replaced Route 4 east of Stanberry in 1951 and the rest in 1960.

In Nebraska, US 136 was previously &quot;Route 3.&quot; US 136 replaced Route 3 in 1960.

US 136 was originally proposed to use I-465 in Indiana to the US 36 interchange so US 136 could meet its parent, US 36.

<doc id="902820" wikidata="Q899670" url="?curid=902820" title="Emissivity">
<text>The emissivity of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in emitting energy as thermal radiation. Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation that most commonly includes both visible radiation (light) and infrared radiation, which is not visible to human eyes. A portion of the thermal radiation from very hot objects (see photograph) is easily visible to the eye.

The emissivity of a surface depends on its chemical composition and geometrical structure. Quantitatively, it is the ratio of the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an ideal black surface at the same temperature as given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law. (A comparison with Planck&#x27;s law is used if one is concerned with particular wavelengths of thermal radiation.) The ratio varies from 0 to 1.

The surface of a perfect black body (with an emissivity of 1) emits thermal radiation at the rate of approximately 448 watts per square metre (W/m) at a room temperature of .

Objects have emissivities less than 1.0, and emit radiation at correspondingly lower rates.

However, wavelength- and subwavelength-scale particles, metamaterials, and other nanostructures may have an emissivity greater than 1.

== Practical applications ==
Emissivities are important in a variety of contexts:
; Insulated windows: Warm surfaces are usually cooled directly by air, but they also cool themselves by emitting thermal radiation. This second cooling mechanism is important for simple glass windows, which have emissivities close to the maximum possible value of 1.0. &quot;Low-E windows&quot; with transparent low-emissivity coatings emit less thermal radiation than ordinary windows. In winter, these coatings can halve the rate at which a window loses heat compared to an uncoated glass window.

; Solar heat collectors: Similarly, solar heat collectors lose heat by emitting thermal radiation. Advanced solar collectors incorporate selective surfaces that have very low emissivities. These collectors waste very little of the solar energy through emission of thermal radiation.
; Thermal shielding: For the protection of structures from high surface temperatures, such as reusable spacecraft or hypersonic aircraft, high-emissivity coatings (HECs), with emissivity values near 0.9, are applied on the surface of insulating ceramics. This facilitates radiative cooling and protection of the underlying structure and is an alternative to ablative coatings, used in single-use reentry capsules.
; Passive daytime radiative cooling: Daytime passive radiative coolers use the extremely cold temperature of outer space (~2.7 K) to emit heat and lower ambient temperatures while requiring zero energy input. These surfaces minimize the absorption of solar radiation to lessen heat gain in order to maximize the emission of LWIR thermal radiation. It has been proposed as a solution to global warming.
; Planetary temperatures: The planets are solar thermal collectors on a large scale. The temperature of a planet&#x27;s surface is determined by the balance between the heat absorbed by the planet from sunlight, heat emitted from its core, and thermal radiation emitted back into space. Emissivity of a planet is determined by the nature of its surface and atmosphere.

; Temperature measurements: Pyrometers and infrared cameras are instruments used to measure the temperature of an object by using its thermal radiation; no actual contact with the object is needed. The calibration of these instruments involves the emissivity of the surface that&#x27;s being measured.

==Mathematical definitions==
In its most general form, emissivity can be specified for a particular wavelength, direction, and polarization.

However, the most commonly used form of emissivity is the &quot;hemispherical total emissivity&quot;, which considers emissions as totaled over all wavelengths, directions, and polarizations, given a particular temperature.

Some specific forms of emissivity are detailed below.

===Hemispherical emissivity===
Hemispherical emissivity of a surface, denoted &quot;ε&quot;, is defined as
: formula_1

where
* &quot;M&quot;e is the radiant exitance of that surface;
* &quot;M&quot;e° is the radiant exitance of a black body at the same temperature as that surface.

===Spectral hemispherical emissivity===
Spectral hemispherical emissivity in frequency and spectral hemispherical emissivity in wavelength of a surface, denoted &quot;ε&quot;ν and &quot;ε&quot;λ, respectively, are defined as
: formula_2

where
* &quot;M&quot;e,ν is the spectral radiant exitance in frequency of that surface;
* &quot;M&quot;e,ν° is the spectral radiant exitance in frequency of a black body at the same temperature as that surface;
* &quot;M&quot;e,λ is the spectral radiant exitance in wavelength of that surface;
* &quot;M&quot;e,λ° is the spectral radiant exitance in wavelength of a black body at the same temperature as that surface.

===Directional emissivity===
Directional emissivity of a surface, denoted &quot;ε&quot;Ω, is defined as
: formula_3

where
* &quot;L&quot;e,Ω is the radiance of that surface;
* &quot;L&quot;e,Ω° is the radiance of a black body at the same temperature as that surface.

===Spectral directional emissivity===
Spectral directional emissivity in frequency and spectral directional emissivity in wavelength of a surface, denoted &quot;ε&quot;ν,Ω and &quot;ε&quot;λ,Ω, respectively, are defined as
: formula_4

where
* &quot;L&quot;e,Ω,ν is the spectral radiance in frequency of that surface;
* &quot;L&quot;e,Ω,ν° is the spectral radiance in frequency of a black body at the same temperature as that surface;
* &quot;L&quot;e,Ω,λ is the spectral radiance in wavelength of that surface;
* &quot;L&quot;e,Ω,λ° is the spectral radiance in wavelength of a black body at the same temperature as that surface.

Hemispherical emissivity can also be expressed as a weighted average of the directional spectral emissivities as described in textbooks on &quot;radiative heat transfer&quot;.

==Emissivities of common surfaces==
Emissivities &quot;ε&quot; can be measured using simple devices such as Leslie&#x27;s cube in conjunction with a thermal radiation detector such as a thermopile or a bolometer. The apparatus compares the thermal radiation from a surface to be tested with the thermal radiation from a nearly ideal, black sample. The detectors are essentially black absorbers with very sensitive thermometers that record the detector&#x27;s temperature rise when exposed to thermal radiation. For measuring room temperature emissivities, the detectors must absorb thermal radiation completely at infrared wavelengths near 10×10−6 metre. Visible light has a wavelength range of about 0.4–0.7×10−6 metre from violet to deep red.

Emissivity measurements for many surfaces are compiled in many handbooks and texts. Some of these are listed in the following table.


Notes:
# These emissivities are the total hemispherical emissivities from the surfaces.
# The values of the emissivities apply to materials that are optically thick. This means that the absorptivity at the wavelengths typical of thermal radiation doesn&#x27;t depend on the thickness of the material. Very thin materials emit less thermal radiation than thicker materials.
# Most emissitivies in the chart above were recorded at room temperature, .

==Closely related properties==

===Absorptance===

There is a fundamental relationship (Gustav Kirchhoff&#x27;s 1859 law of thermal radiation) that equates the emissivity of a surface with its absorption of incident radiation (the &quot;absorptivity&quot; of a surface). Kirchhoff&#x27;s law is rigorously applicable with regard to the spectral directional definitions of emissivity and absorptivity. The relationship explains why emissivities cannot exceed 1, since the largest absorptivity—corresponding to complete absorption of all incident light by a truly black object—is also 1. Mirror-like, metallic surfaces that reflect light will thus have low emissivities, since the reflected light isn&#x27;t absorbed. A polished silver surface has an emissivity of about 0.02 near room temperature. Black soot absorbs thermal radiation very well; it has an emissivity as large as 0.97, and hence soot is a fair approximation to an ideal black body.

With the exception of bare, polished metals, the appearance of a surface to the eye is not a good guide to emissivities near room temperature. For example, white paint absorbs very little visible light. However, at an infrared wavelength of 10×10−6 metre, paint absorbs light very well, and has a high emissivity. Similarly, pure water absorbs very little visible light, but water is nonetheless a strong infrared absorber and has a correspondingly high emissivity.

===Emittance===
Emittance (or emissive power) is the total amount of thermal energy emitted per unit area per unit time for all possible wavelengths. Emissivity of a body at a given temperature is the ratio of the total emissive power of a body to the total emissive power of a perfectly black body at that temperature. Following Planck&#x27;s law, the total energy radiated increases with temperature while the peak of the emission spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths. The energy emitted at shorter wavelengths increases more rapidly with temperature. For example, an ideal blackbody in thermal equilibrium at , will emit 97% of its energy at wavelengths below .

The term emissivity is generally used to describe a simple, homogeneous surface such as silver. Similar terms, emittance and thermal emittance, are used to describe thermal radiation measurements on complex surfaces such as insulation products.

=== Measurement of Emittance ===
Emittance of a surface can be measured directly or indirectly from the emitted energy from that surface. In the direct radiometric method, the emitted energy from the sample is measured directly using a spectroscope such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the indirect calorimetric method, the emitted energy from the sample is measured indirectly using a calorimeter. In addition to these two commonly applied methods, inexpensive emission measurement technique based on the principle of two-color pyrometry.

==Emissivities of planet Earth==
The emissivity of a planet or other astronomical body is determined by the composition and structure of its outer skin. In this context, the &quot;skin&quot; of a planet generally includes both its semi-transparent atmosphere and its non-gaseous surface. The resulting radiative emissions to space typically function as the primary cooling mechanism for these otherwise isolated bodies. The balance between all other incoming plus internal sources of energy versus the outgoing flow regulates planetary temperatures.

For Earth, equilibrium skin temperatures range near the freezing point of water, 260±50 K (-13±50 °C, 8±90 °F). The most energetic emissions are thus within a band spanning about 4-50 μm as governed by Planck&#x27;s law. Emissivities for the atmosphere and surface components are often quantified separately, and validated against satellite- and terrestrial-based observations as well as laboratory measurements. These emissivities serve as parametrizations within some simpler meteorlogic and climatologic models.

===Surface===
Earth&#x27;s surface emissivities (εs) have been inferred with satellite-based instruments by directly observing surface thermal emissions at nadir through a less obstructed atmospheric window spanning 8-13 μm. Values range about εs=0.65-0.99, with lowest values typically limited to the most barren desert areas. Emissivities of most surface regions are above 0.9 due to the dominant influence of water; including oceans, land vegetation, and snow/ice. Globally averaged estimates for the hemispheric emissivity of Earth&#x27;s surface are in the vicinity of εs=0.95.

===Atmosphere===
Water also dominates the planet&#x27;s atmospheric emissivity and absorptivity in the form of water vapor. Clouds, carbon dioxide, and other components make substantial additional contributions, especially where there are gaps in the water vapor absorption spectrum. Nitrogen () and oxygen () - the primary atmospheric components - interact less significantly with thermal radiation in the infrared band. Direct measurement of Earths atmospheric emissivities (εa) are more challenging than for land surfaces due in part to the atmosphere&#x27;s multi-layered and more dynamic structure.

Upper and lower limits have been measured and calculated for εa in accordance with extreme yet realistic local conditions. At the upper limit, dense low cloud structures (consisting of liquid/ice aerosols and saturated water vapor) close the infrared transmission windows, yielding near to black body conditions with εa≈1. At a lower limit, clear sky (cloud-free) conditions promote the largest opening of transmission windows. The more uniform concentration of long-lived trace greenhouse gases in combination with water vapor pressures of 0.25-20 mbar then yield minimum values in the range of εa=0.55-0.8 (with ε=0.35-0.75 for a simulated water-vapor-only atmosphere). Carbon dioxide () and other greenhouse gases contribute about ε=0.2 to εa when atmospheric humidity is low. Researchers have also evaluated the contribution of differing cloud types to atmospheric absorptivity and emissivity.

These days, the detailed processes and complex properties of radiation transport through the atmosphere are evaluated by general circulation models using radiation transport codes and databases such as MODTRAN/HITRAN. Emission, absorption, and scattering are thereby simulated through both space and time.

For many practical applications it may not be possible, economical or necessary to know all emissivity values locally. &quot;Effective&quot; or &quot;bulk&quot; values for an atmosphere or an entire planet may be used. These can be based upon remote observations (from the ground or outer space) or defined according to the simplifications utilized by a particular model. For example, an effective global value of εa≈0.78 has been estimated from application of an idealized single-layer-atmosphere energy-balance model to Earth.

===Effective emissivity due to atmosphere===

The IPCC reports an outgoing thermal radiation flux (OLR) of 239 (237–242) W m and a surface thermal radiation flux (SLR) of 398 (395–400) W m, where the parenthesized amounts indicate the 5-95% confidence intervals as of 2015. These values indicate that the atmosphere (with clouds included) reduces Earth&#x27;s overall emissivity, relative to its surface emissions, by a factor of 239/398 ≈ 0.60. In other words, emissions to space are given by formula_5 where formula_6 is the effective emissivity of Earth as viewed from space and formula_7 is the effective temperature of the surface.

==History==
The concepts of emissivity and absorptivity, as properties of matter and radiation, appeared in the late-eighteenth thru mid-nineteenth century writings of Pierre Prévost, John Leslie, Balfour Stewart and others. In 1860, Gustav Kirchhoff published a mathematical description of their relationship under conditions of thermal equilibrium (i.e. Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation). By 1884 the emissive power of a perfect blackbody was inferred by Josef Stefan using John Tyndall&#x27;s experimental measurements, and derived by Ludwig Boltzmann from fundamental statistical principles. Emissivity, defined as a further proportionality factor to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, was thus implied and utilized in subsequent evaluations of the radiative behavior of grey bodies. For example, Svante Arrhenius applied the recent theoretical developments to his 1896 investigation of Earth&#x27;s surface temperatures as calculated from the planet&#x27;s radiative equilibrium with all of space. By 1900 Max Planck empirically derived a generalized law of blackbody radiation, thus clarifying the emissivity and absorptivity concepts at individual wavelengths.

<doc id="902824" wikidata="Q495495" url="?curid=902824" title="Korean Unification Flag">
<text>The Korean Unification Flag (), also known as the Flag of the Korean Peninsula ( or ), is a flag used to represent all of Korea. When North Korea and South Korea participate as one team at international sporting events, the flag is carried by the unified team. It was introduced at the 1990 Asian Games but was not used by a unified team until the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships. Outside of sports, the flag has been used, particularly in North Korea, to express support for Korean reunification.

The flag is a white field charged in the center with a sky blue silhouette of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and Ulleungdo. The flag&#x27;s depiction of Korean territorial claims has earned it the chagrin of Japan, which claims the Liancourt Rocks. The disputed islets were added to the flag in 2003 but removed in 2018 upon the request of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

== Background and creation ==
Korea has been divided along the 38th parallel since the conclusion of World War II with the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. Exactly three years later, on 15 August 1948, the American-occupied south established the Republic of Korea, and the Soviet-occupied north followed suit with the proclamation of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea on 9 September. As separate sovereign states, North Korea and South Korea have since competed at international sporting events with their own teams, although they both claim to be the sole representative of the entire Korean Peninsula.

A detente in inter-Korean relations came during the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing, China, when both countries agreed to compete as a unified team. The &quot;Unification Flag&quot; was conceived amid logistical difficulties with simultaneously raising two flags (i.e. the flag of North Korea and the flag of South Korea). While the unified team effort was not realized, the flag was prominently displayed by an unofficial cheerleading group during the games. The flag made its official debut in 1991, when North Korea and South Korea competed together as a single team at the 41st World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan.

== Design ==
The current variation of the flag features a sky blue silhouette of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and Ulleungdo on a white background. The silhouette is a smoothened representation of the actual coastline and northern border with China. According to both Koreas, the shape of Korea is meant to be symbolic rather than precise, and several smaller islands such as Geojedo are visibly omitted. The agreement creating the flag explicitly excluded Korea&#x27;s westernmost, southernmost, and easternmost islands: , Marado, and Dokdo (Liancourt Rocks), respectively.

=== Variations ===
The original design of the flag featured only the Korean Peninsula and Jeju Island. Ulleungdo was added 2002 and the Liancourt Rocks were added in 2003. Socotra Rock was added to the flag around September 2006, after a dispute between South Korea and China over their exclusive economic zones.

Ulleungdo and the Liancourt Rocks were removed in an official capacity at the 2018 Winter Olympics and other events in 2018, following pressure from the IOC and Japan. The IOC told South Korea that including the Liancourt Rocks would be viewed as &quot;a political act&quot; and violate the IOC&#x27;s neutrality, to which South Korea agreed. Japan allegedly pressured South Korea to officially remove Ulleungdo as well, citing the fact that it was not on the flag used in Chiba in 1990. Ulleungdo was added back in 2019.

South Korean government policy allows the use of the Liancourt Rocks variation during private events or by people acting in an unofficial capacity, such as cheerleaders. For example, in the 2018 Winter Olympics, the Liancourt Rocks variation was used on the women&#x27;s ice hockey team&#x27;s training uniforms, by the North Korean cheerleading groups during the opening ceremony, and during the team&#x27;s evaluation match five days prior to the opening ceremony (which was hosted by the Korea Ice Hockey Association and not officially part of the Olympic schedule). Japan protested these uses. Additionally, the Liancourt Rocks variation appeared on the team&#x27;s official uniforms four days before the opening ceremony; BBC reported that it was quickly removed following media attention, while Yonhap News Agency reported that it was not removed until just before the athletes entered the opening ceremony.

== Usage ==

=== In sporting events ===
The Korean Unification Flag has been officially used at several international events, either for a unified team, or for when the two teams march together in the opening ceremony while competing separately. In addition to international events, inter-Korean sporting events have used the Unification Flag.

At the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing and the 2005 Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon, South Korea, unofficial cheerleading groups also prominently displayed the flag.

The flag was not used in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Not only was a unified team shelved, but the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG)&#x27;s plan to make the two Korean teams enter consecutively during the opening ceremony was rejected due to opposition by the North Korean delegation at the last moment.

During the 2018 Winter Paralympics, negotiations were stalled by North Korean officials requesting that the Liancourt Rocks be included on the flag.

=== In other contexts ===
According to American Koreanist Brian Reynolds Myers, North Korea and South Korea view the flag in different political contexts. South Koreans view the flag as representing a peaceful relationship and coexistence with North Korea, whereas North Koreans view it as representing a desire to have Korea reunited under the leadership of the North Korean government. In 2010, a large group of North Korean citizens and officials waved the flag when saying goodbye to South Korean Reverend Han Sang-ryol, who was returning to South Korea from North Korea by crossing the Military Demarcation Line at the Korean DMZ. He was immediately arrested upon his return to South Korea.

<doc id="902829" wikidata="Q1277715" url="?curid=902829" title="East 17">
<text>East 17 are an English pop boy band started by Tony Mortimer, Brian Harvey, John Hendy, and Terry Coldwell in 1991. They are best known for their 1994 hit single &quot;Stay Another Day&quot;, which was the UK Christmas number one that year.

The group has released 18 top-20 singles and four top-10 albums and was one of the UK&#x27;s most popular boy bands during the early- to mid-1990s, aided by strong tabloid interest in their &#x27;bad boy&#x27; image, compared to the clean-cut style of rivals Take That. Their style blended pop and hip hop in songs such as &quot;House of Love&quot; and &quot;Let It Rain&quot;.

East 17 has sold over 18 million albums worldwide and according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the group has been certified with sales of 1.8 million albums and 2.8 million singles in the UK.

East 17 have undergone multiple lineup changes, with Coldwell remaining the only constant member. The group continues today under the lineup of Terry Coldwell, Joe Livermore, and former Artful Dodger collaborator Robbie Craig.

==History==
===Formation (1991)===
East 17 began in 1991 when Tony Mortimer was promised a record deal with London Records after he presented his own material. The deal was granted under the condition that he form a group, which would be in the format that London Records were looking for. Mortimer recruited Brian Harvey, John Hendy, and Terry Coldwell.

The group was named East 17 after the postcode of their hometown, Walthamstow.

===&quot;Walthamstow&quot; (1992–1993)===
The group was usually seen as a grittier, more political and hip hop or rap-aligned ensemble than rival boy band Take That, as noted by Guy Adams of &quot;The Independent&quot;:
East 17 had twelve top-10 hits on the UK Singles Chart between 1992 and 1998. Their debut album, &quot;Walthamstow&quot;, reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. It featured a string of Top 20 singles, including &quot;House of Love&quot; and &quot;Deep&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; became a major success in Australia, reaching No. 1 in early 1994 for seven consecutive weeks.

===&quot;Steam&quot; (1994)===
In 1994, upon the release of their second album, &quot;Steam&quot;, East 17 scored their only UK number-one single with &quot;Stay Another Day&quot;.

===&quot;Up All Night&quot; (1995–1996)===
The group&#x27;s next album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Up All Night&quot;, was less successful.

In 1996, the group reached No. 2 with the track &quot;If You Ever&quot;, a duet with Gabrielle. The single was featured on their compilation album &quot;Around the World Hit Singles: The Journey So Far&quot;.

===Mortimer&#x27;s first departure and first split (1997)===
In January 1997, Brian Harvey was engulfed in a drug-related controversy when he claimed that he had taken ecstasy pills on a night out, stating in the press that &quot;It&#x27;s cool to take drugs&quot; and claiming that ecstasy &quot;can make you a better person&quot;.

This went against the group&#x27;s image, and there was intense media scrutiny, leading to questions being raised in the House of Commons. With the group&#x27;s career and reputation tarnished by the affair, Harvey was immediately sacked and Mortimer decided to leave several months later due to creative differences between himself and the rest of the group.

===First reunion and second split (1998–1999)===
Coldwell and Hendy later reinstated Harvey and attempted a comeback in 1998, renaming the group E-17. They landed a record deal with Telstar Records after recording an album&#x27;s worth of self-written material in their home studios. Their first single as E-17 was &quot;Each Time&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the UK. But without Mortimer&#x27;s songwriting influence, the group&#x27;s initial success soon wavered; sales of their next single, &quot;Betcha Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;, were disappointing, reaching number 12 in the charts, and their album &quot;Resurrection&quot; failed to make the UK Top 40. The band was later dropped by their label in 1999 and subsequently split up.

===Post-split activities (1999–2006)===
In 2001, Harvey, now as a solo artist, released a collaboration with Wyclef Jean, with the Top-20 single &quot;Loving You&quot;, but later returned to perform numerous gigs with Coldwell and Hendy. On the ITV1 docusoap &quot;Redcoats&quot;, the trio were shown performing at Butlins in Bognor. Whilst in 2005, Harvey, Coldwell, and Hendy performed in Mongolia. In May 2005, Harvey was seriously injured in a car accident, requiring surgery.

===Second reunion and Mortimer&#x27;s second departure (2006–2009)===
On 4 February 2006, Harvey appeared on the UK music television show &quot;&quot;, where he announced that East 17 might make a comeback with its original lineup. In mid-February 2006, the group reformed and played their first comeback concert on 30 May at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London. After reforming for the one-off performance, it was reported that Mortimer had left the group again due to a confrontation with Harvey, leading to an altercation between the two.

A Channel 4 documentary, &quot;East 17: The Reunion&quot;, which charted the group&#x27;s rise and fall, along with their subsequent attempt to re-launch, was broadcast in May 2007.

East 17 continued to perform without Mortimer as a trio. They played at the University of Strathclyde on 24 September 2006, after DJ Colin Murray was unable to attend. A new single, &quot;Fuck That&quot;, was due to be released in early 2008, along with a new album, &quot;Universalization&quot;, but both went unreleased.

East 17 performed at the 2009 Glastonbury Festival on 25 June in the dance lounge. In November 2009, the group collaborated with Mortimer in aid of the Born Free Foundation. They performed two of their best-known songs—&quot;Deep&quot; and &quot;Stay Another Day&quot;—for the &quot;Wild &amp; Live!&quot; event at the Royal Albert Hall. After the performance, the four agreed that it would be best if they never sang together again. However, according to a BBC Radio 2 interview with Zoë Ball in December 2009, songwriter Tony Mortimer mentioned that the band were on &quot;talking terms&quot; and planning a comeback for 2010.

===Mortimer&#x27;s second return, Harvey&#x27;s departure, Dreelan&#x27;s arrival and departure, and &quot;Dark Light&quot; (2010–2013)===
Tony Mortimer returned to East 17 in 2010. Brian Harvey left soon after, when his commitment was questioned by the rest of the group; he had been missing rehearsals and cancelling performances. In 2011, T-Mobile used the East 17 song &quot;House of Love&quot; in a Royal Wedding &quot;spoof&quot; commercial. In April 2011, it was announced that Blair Dreelan had joined the band for their Back to the Future tour in August and September 2011 to promote their comeback single, &quot;Secret of My Life&quot;. On 28 September 2011, Dreelan left the group due to contractual obligations. On 27 November 2011, East 17 appeared as musical guests on &quot;X Factor Romania&quot;.

East 17&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Dark Light&quot;, along with the new single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get You Off My Mind&quot;, were released in 2012.

===Mortimer&#x27;s third departure, Craig&#x27;s arrival, &quot;24/7&quot;, and Hendy&#x27;s departure (2013–present)===
Tony Mortimer departed for the third time in 2013. Robbie Craig (born 1967) later joined East 17 in early 2014. John Hendy and Terry Coldwell became the only original members in the group at that stage.

In 2017, East 17 partook in B*Witched&#x27;s Australia &amp; NZ Tour as a supporting act alongside Atomic Kitten, S Club 3, and Liberty X. During this time, the band released their sixth studio album, &quot;24/7&quot;, exclusively in Australia, titling it &quot;24/7: Australian Tour Edition&quot;. In June 2018, John Hendy departed the group, citing personal reasons. Since then, Terry John joined the band as Hendy&#x27;s replacement, performed with them at numerous shows, but eventually also left and was replaced by Joe Livermore.

On 27 August 2021, East 17 released &quot;24/7&quot; internationally.

On 27 May 2022, East 17 released a new single, said to be from an upcoming album, called &quot;I Just Wanna&quot;.

On 1 December 2023, the band issued the single &quot;Merry Quitmas&quot;. It was released in collaboration with Riot Labs, an anti-smoking charity.

On 11 December 2024, they released the single &quot;Tell Me You&#x27;re the One&quot;.

<text>William Marquitz &quot;Little Bill&quot; Johnston (November 2, 1894 – May 1, 1946) was an American world No. 1 tennis player.

==Biography==
Bill Johnston was born November 2, 1894, in San Francisco, the son of Robert Johnston, an electrical plant mechanic and Margaret Burns, of Irish origin. Johnston started to play tennis in early 1906, aged 11, on the public asphalt courts in Golden Gate Park. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the schools were closed, and he spent much of his spare time practicing on the tennis courts. He achieved his first tournament victory at the 1910 Bay Counties junior singles competition.

In 1916, Johnston won the Cincinnati Open (now Cincinnati Masters) after Clarence Griffin defaulted in the challenge round. Johnston won the Longwood Challenge Cup, played on the Longwood Courts at Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts in 1913, 1916, 1919, 1920 and 1921.

During World War I, Johnston served in the U.S. Navy.

Johnston was the co-World No. 1 player in 1919 and in 1922 respectively along with Gerald Patterson and Bill Tilden. He won the US Championships in 1915 and 1919 as well as the World Hard Court Championships (clay) and Wimbledon in 1923.

Until &quot;Big Bill&quot; Tilden began to defeat him regularly in 1920, Johnston had been the best American player for a number of years and was ranked No. 1 by the United States Lawn Tennis Association in 1915 and 1919. In July 1919, Johnston defeated Tilden in the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championships. A month later, Johnston beat Tilden in three straight sets in the final of the 1919 US Championships, then Tilden overtook him in 1920. Johnston remained competitive with Tilden for the next seven or eight years, but was never able to beat Tilden in an important match again. For instance, in 1922 Johnston defeated Tilden three times out of four occasions but Tilden beat Johnston in the final of the U.S. Championships in five sets. In 1923, despite Johnston winning both the World Hard Court Championships and Wimbledon, he failed to beat Tilden at the US Championships, losing in three one-sided sets. Johnston threatened to get closer to beating Tilden on the big stage in following years, but memorably lost the 1925 US Championships final in five sets to Tilden. Johnston was runner-up a record six times in the US Championships, and this is still a record today. Together Johnston and Tilden won seven consecutive Davis Cup trophies, from 1920 to 1926, a record that still stands. In September 1927, Johnston announced his retirement after the U.S. Davis Cup loss to the French team consisting of the &#x27;Four Musketeers&#x27; and confirmed his decision in mid-1928. He turned down an offer to become professional.

Johnston was renowned for the power and deadliness of his forehand drive, which he hit shoulder-high with a Western grip and which was considered the best forehand of his time.

After his tennis career, Johnston was active in the brokerage industry. He died of tuberculosis on May 1, 1946, at the age of 51.

==Legacy==
Bill Johnston was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1958.

<text>Roberto Madrazo Pintado (born July 30, 1952) is a Mexican politician and member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. He was the candidate of the alliance between his party and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) in the 2006 Mexican presidential election. He served as Governor of Tabasco from 1995 to 2000.

==Early years==
Madrazo was born in Villahermosa, Tabasco, to Carlos A. Madrazo and Graciela Pintado Jiménez. His father was a reformist politician at a time when the PRI was the only viable party. Both of his parents died in a plane crash when he was sixteen. Although his father came from humble roots, his prestige allowed Roberto to become one of Mexico&#x27;s elite. He studied law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City and urbanism at the University of California at Los Angeles, and headed the PRI Youth.

== Early political career ==
Between 1976 and 1988, he represented Tabasco in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. He served as governor of Tabasco from 1994 to 2000. As governor, Madrazo acquired a reputation as a populist politician who promoted economic development. 

==2000 presidential election==
Madrazo sought the PRI&#x27;s presidential candidacy in 2000 but lost to Francisco Labastida, a former governor of Sinaloa and former Secretary of the Interior in the cabinet of President Ernesto Zedillo, whom Madrazo perceived as having chosen Labastida as his successor in the Mexican political tradition of the &quot;dedazo&quot; (&quot;the finger&quot;, referring to hand-chosen presidential succession). As a candidate, Madrazo was described as having &quot;populist flair&quot;.

The PRI had never lost a presidential election since its founding, and the party&#x27;s structure made the president the arbiter of its internal affairs. Although this was not the first time in PRI&#x27;s history the presidential authority was defied, Madrazo&#x27;s anti-dedazo campaign was particularly aggressive. He even used a pun on his surname: &quot;Dale un Madrazo al dedazo&quot; (a &quot;madrazo&quot; is vulgar term for a severe blow in Mexican Spanish; loosely translated, &quot;give a blow to the dedazo&quot;) as a promise to end the corrupt tradition. He attracted some followers inside the PRI but the primary, which, in an unprecedented turn of events, was open to registered voters and not just PRI members, favored Labastida.

Madrazo accepted the outcome, but his aggressive internal campaign had weakened Labastida&#x27;s candidacy in the eyes of the electorate, and was seen as a major factor in his defeat by the National Action Party (PAN) candidate Vicente Fox Quesada.

After the historical loss of the presidential election in 2000, the PRI was faced an uncertain future. Madrazo, however, as party leader, was able to parlay the party&#x27;s strong infrastructure and history into electoral victories, particularly in his home state of Tabasco, which helped avoid internecine troubles.

==PRI presidency==
Madrazo is mainly credited for bringing cohesion to a disjointed PRI after it historically lost the 2000 presidential election. Madrazo was able to wrestle control of the PRI by negotiating deals with different power groups within the PRI and by neutralizing political adversaries within the party.
Madrazo ran for the presidency of the PRI in 2002, allying himself with Elba Esther Gordillo (as his general secretary), the powerful leader of the National Education Workers&#x27; Union. Together, they defeated their adversary, Senator Beatriz Paredes in a close election. After the election, Gordillo became his political rival, resulting in her retirement from public life for a year amidst many verbal accusations (she was accused of murdering members of her labor-based opposition and conspiring against PRI members). In early 2005, Gordillo returned to the political scene and broke publicly with Madrazo.

==2006 presidential campaign==
Madrazo&#x27;s position as national leader of the PRI gave him a considerable advantage in his campaign for the 2006 presidential candidacy. As the election neared, there had been a growing discomfort among other would-be PRI candidates, who increasingly demanded that clear rules for the internal campaign be set. Many PRI-affiliated state governors formed the group &quot;Democratic Unity&quot;, nicknamed TUCOM (&quot;Todos Unidos Contra Madrazo&quot;, &quot;All United Against Madrazo&quot;) in the media. They chose Arturo Montiel as their pre-candidate. In the primary elections, Madrazo, Montiel, and a third contender, , competed for the candidacy. Montiel resigned after legal issues concerning mansions in Mexico and France (his wife is a French citizen); his sons were also implicated in embezzlement schemes. Montiel&#x27;s resignation resulted in Madrazo&#x27;s candidacy, although minimal participation on the part of the PRI votership may have indicated a lack of faith in the PRI or a general disinterest. He was also accused by political rivals of tax evasion.

After the primaries, Madrazo forged an alliance with the PVEM, and earned the party&#x27;s nomination. Madrazo faced a battle against Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the former Head of Government of the Federal District and PRD presidential candidate. López Obrador was something of a personal rival, having previously lost to Madrazo in the election for the Tabasco governorship in 1994. Another contestant was the right-of-center PAN candidate Felipe Calderón.

The public debate between Madrazo and Gordillo resulted in the creation of a new political party, the Partido Nueva Alianza, formed to oppose Madrazo in his bid for the presidency. For this she was suspended in her rights as a PRI &quot;militant&quot; (an official party position) pending an expulsion process. Gordillo has made it clear that she believes Madrazo is not a viable candidate for Mexico&#x27;s presidency. The Nueva Alianza candidate, Roberto Campa, spent much of the first presidential debate attacking Madrazo.

Shortly after Gordillo&#x27;s denunciation, the Mexico City newspaper &quot;Reforma&quot; published an article that condemned Madrazo as the owner of a luxury penthouse in a prestigious high-rise tower in Miami worth eight million pesos ($800,000 U.S. dollars) and three luxury apartments in Mexico City with the alleged value of seven million pesos. However, Madrazo&#x27;s public declaration of assets, liabilities and expenses of January 19, 2006 denied the allegations.

Going into the elections, Madrazo polled at 30 percent.

On July 3, 2006, Madrazo and his coalition conceded defeat in the presidential election. According to official results, he received only 22.26% of the vote or 9,301,441 votes out of 41,791,322 votes—the PRI&#x27;s worst presidential result to that point.

==Berlin Marathon scam==
Madrazo was accused of cheating during the 2007 Berlin Marathon. Posting a time of 2 hours and 41 minutes, his time was 36 minutes behind the world record at the time. His 25 and 30 km checkpoints were unregistered. Madrazo finished the race in 146th place, and allegedly took 21 minutes to cover the 15 kilometers between the 20 km and 35 km marks, while the world record for this distance is 41 minutes.
The cheating was revealed because the time registration of start, finish, and all split times of the marathon was done by transponder timing. Eventually Madrazo was disqualified, causing a political disturbance in Mexico.

== Personal life ==
He is married to Isabel de la Parra Trillo.

<doc id="902849" wikidata="Q1430068" url="?curid=902849" title="Florida panhandle">
<text>The Florida panhandle (also known as West Florida and Northwest Florida) is the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida. It is a salient roughly long, bordered by Alabama on the north and the west, Georgia on the north, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. Its eastern boundary is arbitrarily defined. It is defined by its southern culture and rural geography relative to the rest of Florida, as well as closer cultural links to French-influenced Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Its major communities include Pensacola, Navarre, Destin, Panama City Beach, and Tallahassee.

As is the case with the other eight U.S. states that have panhandles, the geographic meaning of the term is inexact and elastic. References to the Florida panhandle always include the ten counties west of the Apalachicola River, a natural geographic boundary, which was the historic dividing line between the British colonies of West Florida and East Florida. These western counties also lie in the Central Time Zone (with the exception of Gulf County, which is divided between the Eastern and Central Time zones), while the rest of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone. References to the panhandle &quot;may&quot; also include some or all of eleven counties immediately east of the Apalachicola known as the Big Bend region, along the curve of Apalachee Bay.

Like the rest of North Florida, including North Central Florida, the panhandle is more similar in culture and climate to the Deep South than the rest of the state, particularly than Central Florida and South Florida in the lower peninsula. The Florida panhandle is known for its conservative politics, religious adherence, and &quot;piney woods&quot;.

The largest city in the panhandle is Tallahassee, the state capital, population 196,169 (2020). However, the largest city west of the Appalachicola river is Pensacola, which has a population of 54,312 (2020) and also has the largest Metropolitan area in the entire panhandle with a population of 511,502 (2020). This metro area includes the second- and third-largest communities in the region, Pensacola and Navarre. The total population of the panhandle, as of the 2010 census, was 1,407,925, just under 7.5% of Florida&#x27;s total population as recorded in the same census. At roughly 70 persons per square mile, its population density is less than 20% of Florida&#x27;s as a whole.

==Coastal regions==

===Emerald Coast===

&quot;Emerald Coast&quot;, a term coined in 1983, refers in general to the beaches and coastal resorts from Pensacola to Port St. Joe, but is sometimes used to refer, by extension, to the panhandle as a whole, especially west of the Apalachicola. Earlier designations include &quot;Playground of the Gulfcoast&quot; and the &quot;Miracle Strip&quot;, especially for the area between Fort Walton Beach and Panama City. Coastal regions of the following counties (if not the entirety of the counties themselves) are usually included when referring to the Emerald Coast:

* Escambia County
* Santa Rosa County
* Okaloosa County 
* Walton County

Coastal portions of Bay County are also regularly included when referring to the Emerald Coast, but with somewhat less regularity than the four aforementioned counties listed above.

===Forgotten Coast===
The &quot;Forgotten Coast&quot; is a trademarked term coined in the early 1990s used to refer to the coastal portion of the Florida panhandle extending from Mexico Beach or southeastern Bay County on the Gulf of Mexico to St. Marks on Apalachee Bay. It is usually not considered a part of the Emerald Coast, which lies directly adjacent to the west. Coastal regions of the following counties (if not the entirety of the counties themselves) are usually included when referring to the Forgotten Coast:

* Gulf County
* Franklin County
* Wakulla County
* Small portions of Bay County

==Physical features==
The Apalachicola River is the largest river of the panhandle. It is formed by the junction of several rivers, including the Chattahoochee and the Flint, where the boundaries of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida meet. From there, it flows southward to the town of Apalachicola.

Major estuaries include, from west to east: Perdido Bay, fed by the Perdido River, which forms the west boundary of Florida; Escambia Bay and East Bay, fed by the Escambia River and Blackwater River, respectively; Choctawhatchee Bay, fed by the Choctawhatchee River; and St. Andrews Bay, fed by Econfina Creek. Pensacola Bay, a deepwater port, is formed by the joining of Escambia and East bays. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, completed in 1949, traverses the lower panhandle by means of bays, lagoons, sounds, and human-made canals. The barrier islands of Perdido Key and Santa Rosa Island extend from the Panhandle&#x27;s western extremity through Fort Walton Beach to Destin.

Britton Hill is the highest natural point in the state
at above mean sea level.

==History==
===19th century===
Throughout the 19th century the panhandle was sparsely populated, dotted in places with small farming communities, none of which had as many as a thousand residents. Many panhandle residents had, in fact, migrated to the area from Alabama and had relatives there; it was also easier to trade with and travel to southern Alabama than to reach East Florida by slow, arduous journey across the thick cypress swamps and dense pine forests of the panhandle. It was natural for West Floridians to feel that they had more in common with their nearby neighbors in Alabama than with the residents of the peninsula, hundreds of miles away.

In 1821, Pensacola was the only city (in 19th-century terms) in West Florida, with a population estimated to be about 3,000. In the 1850 census, the enumerated population of Pensacola was 2,164 (including 741 slaves and 350 &quot;free Negroes&quot;).

====Alabama annexation proposals====
During the course of the century, proposals for ceding the Florida counties west of the Apalachicola River to Alabama were often raised:
*In 1811, while Florida was still a Spanish possession, American settlers in the territory sent a petition to Congress asking to be incorporated into the Mississippi Territory, which at that time included present-day Alabama. (See West Florida article.)
*In 1819, the constitutional convention of Alabama asked Congress to include West Florida in their new state.
*In 1822, only a year after the U.S. acquired the entire Florida territory from Spain, residents of West Florida sent a petition to the U.S. House of Representatives asking that their section be annexed to Alabama, and Alabama Senator John Williams Walker also promoted the idea.
*In 1826, the &quot;Pensacola Gazette&quot; published a number of letters advocating annexation to Alabama, though the editor remarked that some Pensacolians opposed the idea.
*In 1840, a public meeting in Pensacola produced a demand that West Florida be united with Alabama. In the same year, the territorial Legislature notified Congress that it opposed allowing Alabama to annex West Florida, but in 1844, the year before statehood, the Legislature reversed its stance and asked that West Florida be separated.
*In 1856, advocates of annexation were able to get a bill passed by the Legislature authorizing a referendum on the issue, but Governor James E. Broome vetoed the measure. The &quot;Pensacola Gazette&quot; reported that &quot;annexation is desired by a large majority of the people&quot; of the area.
*In 1858, the Alabama Legislature unsuccessfully tried to open negotiations with Florida on the subject.
*The annexation issue was eclipsed by the Civil War and the war&#x27;s effects on the region, but in 1868, with Pensacola now connected by the panhandle&#x27;s sole railroad line to the Alabama cities of Mobile and Montgomery, the issue came to a head again and was finally put to a vote of the people. In that year, the Alabama Legislature approved a joint resolution authorizing their Governor to negotiate with the Governor of Florida about the annexation of West Florida. An offer of one million dollars in Alabama state bonds, paying 8 percent interest for thirty years, was included. Both states appointed commissioners to make detailed recommendations on the matter.
*On November 2, 1869, a referendum was held in the West Florida counties (except Jackson, which was in the throes of bloody racial violence), with a result of 1162 to 661 in favor of annexation. However, political objection developed in Alabama to the high price, and the Legislature took no action on the results of the referendum.
*In 1873, a similar proposal was made in the Alabama Legislature, which the state senate approved, though it did not pass a separate proposal to finance the measure by selling all of Alabama&#x27;s territory west of the Tombigbee River, including the city of Mobile, to Mississippi. However, nothing came of this action.
*In 1901, Alabama made yet another offer when the Legislature appointed a commission to negotiate with Florida about annexation, but this attempt, too, was unsuccessful.

The building of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad, completed in 1883, finally linked Pensacola and the panhandle solidly with the rest of the state and ended the region&#x27;s isolation, although from time to time during the twentieth century there were still occasional calls for annexation that generated some public discussion but no legislative action.

===20th century===
In the last quarter of the century, hurricanes that directly struck the area and caused significant damage included Hurricane Eloise in 1975, Hurricane Kate in 1985, and Hurricane Erin and Hurricane Opal, both in 1995.

The area was a prime target of the March 1993 Storm of the Century.

===21st century===
The panhandle suffered direct hits from Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Dennis in 2005. Ivan was the most disastrous, making landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, with 120 mile-per-hour (193 km/h) winds and a storm surge that devastated Perdido Key and Santa Rosa Island, wrecked the Interstate 10 bridge across Escambia Bay, and destroyed thousands of homes in the region, some as far away as inland.

On June 23, 2010, oil from the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill landed on Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach, damaging the fishing and tourism industries, and prompting a massive clean-up effort.

On October 10, 2018, the panhandle suffered a direct hit from Hurricane Michael, with winds as high as 160 mph. Michael was one of only four category 5 hurricanes to ever hit the US mainland. Thousands of homes were destroyed, and apartment rents in Panama City increased, with a $500 apartment renting for $1000 in 2019. Recovery from Hurricane Michael was not complete in June 2019, and disaster relief for the panhandle remained stalled in Congress.

==Economy==
Historically, the economy of the panhandle depended mainly on farming, forestry and lumbering, paper mills, import/export shipping at Pensacola and to a lesser extent at Panama City, shipbuilding, and commercial fishing. After World War II, the economy was boosted by the numerous military bases established in the region, as well as the growth of tourism and the hospitality industry.

In addition to military bases, state and local governments, hospitals, schools, and colleges, major private employers in the second half of the twentieth century included Monsanto and Westinghouse plants at Pensacola, the St. Joe Paper Company in Port St. Joe, and Gulf Power, a major electric utility company.

Unlike central and southern Florida, the panhandle has never been a producer of citrus crops because the area is subject to regular frosts and freezes during winter, which destroy citrus fruits.

==Transportation==

===Road===
Interstate 10 is the only interstate highway in the panhandle, connecting the extreme west with North Florida and Jacksonville. Other older east–west routes include U.S. Highway 90 and U.S. Highway 98. Important north–south routes west of the Apalachicola River include U.S. Highway 29, U.S. Highway 331, and U.S. Highway 231, all linking to Alabama and Interstate 65. State Road 20 stretches from Niceville to Tallahassee.

===Rail===
Freight service is provided by the Class III Florida Gulf &amp; Atlantic Railroad, which acquired most of the CSX main line from Pensacola to Jacksonville on June 1, 2019. (For the history of this line, see Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad.)

Passenger service ended with the creation of Amtrak in 1971, but was revived with the extension of the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; to Orlando beginning in 1993; however, passenger service was discontinued after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. Other regional short-line railroads serving the panhandle are the Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway (formerly BNSF Railway, ex-Frisco Railway), the Bay Line Railroad, and the AN Railway.

===Air===
Major airports include:
* Pensacola International Airport
* Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport
* Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport
* Tallahassee International Airport
* Bob Sikes Airport
* Destin Executive Airport
* DeFuniak Springs Airport
* Apalachicola Regional Airport
* Perry-Foley Airport

==Education==

The following institutions of higher learning are located in the Florida panhandle.

State University System:
*Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (Tallahassee)
*Florida State University (Tallahassee)
*University of West Florida (Pensacola)

Florida College System:
*Chipola College (Marianna)
*Gulf Coast State College (Panama City)
*Northwest Florida State College (Niceville)
*Pensacola State College (Pensacola)
*Tallahassee Community College (Tallahassee)

Religiously affiliated:
*Baptist College of Florida (Graceville)
*Pensacola Christian College (Pensacola)

==Politics==

The politics of the Florida panhandle vary considerably depending on location. The western panhandle, particularly the Emerald Coast, was one of the earliest areas to shake off its Yellow Dog Democrat roots, and since the 1990s has become the most Republican part of Florida. Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Panama City regularly give Republicans close to or over 70% margins in state and national elections. However, Tallahassee and Gadsden County tend to be strongly Democratic. In the 2008 presidential election, John McCain received 421,287 votes (60.1%) in the panhandle, while Barack Obama received 279,206 votes (39.9%).

Under the 2023-2033 decennial reapportionment, the Florida panhandle is split between Florida&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which is currently vacant, and Florida&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented by Neal Dunn (R–Panama City).

* Panama City-Lynn Haven-Panama City Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area – 202,236 (2020)
* Tallahassee Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area – 367,413 (2010)

==Beaches==
The panhandle is renowned for the white sand beaches and blue-green waters of its barrier islands fronting the Gulf of Mexico. According to the National Park Service:

The stunning sugar-white beaches of Gulf Islands National Seashore are composed of fine quartz eroded from granite in the Appalachian Mountains. The sand is carried seaward by rivers and creeks and deposited by currents along the shore.

The beach towns in the panhandle, many of which play host to college students during spring break, are sometimes derisively called &quot;the Redneck Riviera&quot;. The term was used as the title of a song by country music artist Tom T. Hall on his 1996 album &quot;Songs from Sopchoppy&quot;. The album takes its name from a town in rural Wakulla County, near Tallahassee.

Tourists have been drawn to the panhandle since the building of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad in the 1880s. Pensacola Beach has been a major tourist attraction since the building of bridges between the mainland and Santa Rosa Island in 1931. After World War II, an increase in both tourism and population of the area led to a proliferation of motels, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions, and amusement parks along the coast, concentrated in Pensacola Beach, Fort Walton Beach, and Panama City Beach. Examples include the Gulfarium marine park and aquarium in Fort Walton Beach, and the former Miracle Strip Amusement Park (1963–2004) in Panama City Beach.

In 1971, the federal government acquired many acres of the coastal islands in Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa counties, preserving them from commercial development by establishing the Gulf Islands National Seashore, which also covers some islands off the Mississippi coast. Other beach areas protected by the state of Florida include

* Perdido Key State Park
* Big Lagoon State Park 
* Henderson Beach State Park
* Grayton Beach State Park
* St. Andrews State Park
* St. Joseph Peninsula State Park
* St. George Island State Park

Both state and federal parks offer facilities for camping, picnicking, and other recreational pursuits. In addition, some parts of the coastline are federal property belonging to Pensacola Naval Air Station, Eglin Air Force Base, and Tyndall Air Force Base, and so are likewise protected from commercial development.

In addition, seven state aquatic preserves, covering thousands of acres of submerged lands in coastal areas, are located in the panhandle. A number of other state parks, preserves, and forests are located inland.

The 1970s also saw the beginnings of a number of upscale beach resorts, condominium towers, vacation homes, and planned communities, such as Seaside and Sandestin, so that most of the privately owned areas of the coastline are now heavily developed.

==Military bases==
Major military bases include the Pensacola Naval Air Station (the home of Naval Aviation in the United States), Eglin Air Force Base and Hurlburt Field near Ft. Walton Beach, Naval Support Activity Panama City in Panama City Beach, and Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City. Smaller military bases in the Florida panhandle include the Center for Information Warfare Training in Pensacola, Naval Air Station Whiting Field near Milton and Duke Field near Crestview.

The 1983-84 television show &quot;Emerald Point N.A.S.&quot; was set in a naval air station somewhere in the American South, similar to Pensacola NAS. The 1997-2000 action/adventure series &quot;&quot; was explicitly set there.

<text>Filip Konowal VC (; &quot;Pylyp Myronovych Konoval&quot;; 25 March 1887 – 3 June 1959) was a highly decorated Ukrainian Canadian soldier. He is the first Canadian Corps member not born in the British Empire (and the only Ukrainian) to be awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces. He was also entitled to the Cross of St George, 4th Class.

He is the patron of Royal Canadian Legion Branch 360 (Konowal Branch) in Toronto.

==First World War==
Konowal was born to a peasant family on 25 March 1887 in Kutkivtsi, in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) near the border with Austria-Hungary. At an early age, he worked as a mason alongside his father. He married Hanna (?-1932/33) in 1908. They had a daughter, Marichka.

Soon after his marriage, he decided to join the Imperial Russian Army, where he served as an instructor in hand-to-hand combat. After demobilization, Konowal returned home and took up work as a feller in Siberia, before accepting a job with a Canadian company in 1913. Departing from Vladivostok, Konowal crossed the Pacific Ocean to Vancouver, British Columbia, and continued working as a feller, gradually making his way east. By the beginning of 1914, Konowal had lost his job as a feller and ended up working a series of odd jobs until the outbreak of World War I.

On 12 July 1915, Konowal enlisted in the 77th Canadian Infantry Battalion, and on 19 June 1916, left Halifax for Liverpool. After arriving in England, Konowal was promoted to acting corporal and was transferred to the 47th (British Columbia) Battalion of the 4th Canadian Division. In August 1916, the 4th Division arrived in France, and took part in the assault on Vimy Ridge in April 1917. From 22 to 24 August 1917, during the Battle of Hill 70 in Lens, France, he was recognized for conspicuous gallantry in the face of the enemy and awarded the Victoria Cross. Konowal&#x27;s medal was personally presented by King George V, and he was promoted to sergeant.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 23 November 1917 (dated 26 November 1917):

No. 144039 A./Cpl. Filip Konowal, Can. Inf.

For most conspicuous bravery and leadership when in charge of a section in attack. His section had the difficult task of mopping up cellars, craters and machine-gun emplacements. Under his able direction all resistance was overcome successfully, and heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy. In one cellar he himself bayonetted three enemy and attacked single-handed seven others in a crater, killing them all.

On reaching the objective, a machine-gun was holding up the right flank, causing many casualties. Cpl. Konowal rushed forward and entered the emplacement, killed the crew, and brought the gun back to our lines.

The next day he again attacked single-handed another machine-gun emplacement, killed three of the crew, and destroyed the gun and emplacement with explosives.

This non-commissioned officer alone killed at least sixteen of the enemy, and during the two days&#x27; actual fighting carried on continuously his good work until severely wounded.

== Post-war ==
On 19 July 1919, Konowal accompanied Leontiy Diedek, a friend and fellow veteran, to a particularly rough area in Hull, Quebec. The two men went for dinner at a restaurant; Diedek left early in order to look at some bicycles at the home of William Artich, an &#x27;Austrian&#x27; bootlegger and bicycle salesman. Konowal became aware of a commotion and went to investigate. A fight had started between Artich and Diedek. By the time Konowal arrived, Diedek had been viciously beaten and Artich was armed with a knife. Konowal managed to gain control over the weapon and killed Artich with a single stab to the chest. Konowal did not attempt to flee the scene; when police came, the First World War veteran stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve killed fifty-two of them, that makes the fifty-third.&quot;

Veterans rallied to his cause and raised enough money to bail Konowal in October 1919; the trial ended up being postponed three times, finally beginning in 1921. After extensive tests, it was discovered that Konowal had serious medical problems stemming from his war wounds: pressure on his brain was increasing and his condition was continually deteriorating. Medical experts unanimously agreed that a wartime gunshot wound to the head was likely making Konowal mentally unstable, causing flashbacks to the war&#x27;s battles. The jury agreed and he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, then institutionalized for seven years. By the end of this period, his condition had improved dramatically, and he was released from a Montreal mental hospital in 1928.

He eventually found employment as a caretaker at the House of Commons in Ottawa, with the help of a military associate. When Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King saw the colours of a Victoria Cross ribbon on Konowal while he was at work, King arranged for him to be reassigned to a lifetime job in King&#x27;s personal office.

Unfortunately, tragedy struck once again when Konowal attempted to contact his family: his wife had died during the Soviet famine of 1932–1933 (the Holodomor) and his daughter was nowhere to be found, though it was later reported she survived and left descendants. Konowal married a French-Canadian woman, Juliette Leduc-Auger (1901–1987), in 1934 and adopted her two sons, Roland and Albert.

In 1956, he joined 300 other Victoria Cross recipients in London for events celebrating the honour&#x27;s centennial, hosted by then British Prime Minister Anthony Eden and Queen Elizabeth II.

Konowal died in 1959 at Hull, Quebec, aged 72. He was buried at Notre Dame de Lourdes Cemetery, Ottawa, under a headstone in section A, lot 502.

==Honours==
In addition to the Victoria Cross, he was also awarded the British War Medal (1914–1920), Victory Medal (1914–1919), George VI Coronation Medal (1937), Elizabeth II Coronation Medal (1953), and was entitled to the Cross of St George, 4th Class, from Russia.

The Royal Canadian Legion Branch 360 (Konowal Branch) in Toronto made him its patron in 1953.

In 1996, Konowal&#x27;s headstone was replaced by an upright marker, and memorial plaques were unveiled:

* in the Cartier Square drill hall of the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards in Ottawa
* at St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic Church, 952 Green Valley Crescent in Ottawa
* at Legion Branch 360 (Konowal Branch) in Toronto – transferred to the care of the Ukrainian National Federation, Toronto Branch in 2007 after Branch No. 360 was shut down by Dominion Command
* at the Royal Westminster Regiment&#x27;s armoury (Konowal&#x27;s regiment) in New Westminster, B.C – stolen since replaced with a stone marker
* on a cairn at Selo Ukraina Memorial Park, near Dauphin, Manitoba.
* in 2000, at Konowal&#x27;s place of birth, Kutkivtsi, Ukraine.
* On 22 August 2005, a bas relief of Konowal was unveiled at Lens, France
* On 8 April 2017 the Battle of Hill 70 Memorial was unveiled at Loos-en-Gohelle, France, the central pathway named the Konowal Walk.

* On 10 May 2017, a feature documentary on Filip Konowal&#x27;s life, Konowal: the man behind the medal, was premiered on Documentary Channel (Canada). It was produced and directed by James Motluk and received a Platinum Remi Award at the Houston Worldfest 2017

==The Victoria Cross decoration==
The Canadian War Museum in Ottawa purchased Konowal&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals in 1969.

The decoration went missing sometime in the 1970s, apparently stolen, and was sold to an antique shop along with some Hawaiian coins in the mid-1990s. The shop owner believed the decoration was a fake, as it was inscribed with &quot;For Valour&quot; – evidently not realizing that all VCs awarded to Canadians had the English motto. (The source of confusion was the fact that a new Canadian VC was introduced into the Canadian Honours System in 1993, bearing the Latin motto &quot;Pro Valore&quot;). The decoration was rediscovered when the shop owner offered it to the Jeffrey Hoare Auction House in London, Ontario in April 2004. A British collector discovered the auction and notified Lubomyr Luciuk, co-author of a booklet about Konowal, who took steps to have the decoration secured. It was recovered by the police and returned to permanent display at the War Museum on 23 August 2004, 87 years after it was awarded.

<doc id="902870" wikidata="Q1941311" url="?curid=902870" title="Mo Ostin">
<text>Mo Ostin (born Morris Meyer Ostrofsky; March 27, 1927 – July 31, 2022) was an American record executive. The chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Records from 1972 to 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. 

==Early life==
Ostin was born Morris Meyer Ostrofsky in New York City on March 27, 1927. His family was Jewish and fled Russia during the Russian Revolution. They eventually relocated to Los Angeles when Ostin was thirteen and operated a small grocery market close to the Fairfax Theatre. He attended Fairfax High School, before studying economics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He subsequently commenced studies at the UCLA School of Law, but ultimately dropped out to support his family.

==Career==
Ostin began his career in the mid-1950s as comptroller at Clef Records, a record company started by Norman Granz, brother of friend and neighbor, Irving Granz. The company was soon renamed &#x27;Verve&#x27;, where he was involved with Jazz At The Philharmonic, a worldwide concert promotion operation that provided a live performance platform for the label&#x27;s touring stars. Frank Sinatra tried and failed to buy Verve, which was eventually sold to MGM Records. Sinatra was reportedly so impressed by the company&#x27;s artists and the management&#x27;s style that he formed his own Reprise Records in 1960 and hired Ostin to head it. Three years later, Reprise joined forces with Warner Bros. The first rock act Ostin signed to Reprise was the Kinks. He signed Jimi Hendrix in the spring of 1967 based on hearing &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, then was amazed after seeing him perform at the Monterey Pop Festival.

Ostin ultimately spent 31 years at Warner/Reprise from 1963 to 1994, serving as its chairman and CEO from 1972 onwards. He oversaw the signing of Prince, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac, R.E.M., Madonna, Paul Simon, Talking Heads, the Grateful Dead, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Van Halen, the Who, and Randy Newman. He was noted for giving artists creative freedom and creating a company geared towards artists, attributing this outlook to his time with Sinatra. Ostin later recounted how he trusted Prince to the point where he would only listen to his music once it was completed. Ostin was also instrumental in the acquisition of the independent Elektra label by Warner Communications, as well as the subsequent formation of WEA Corporation and WEA International. Recognized as an industry titan, he served as chairman of the Recording Industry Association of America for a two-year term. He left Warner acrimoniously in 1994 after they requested that he slash his payroll, turning down their offer of a three-year extension. He described the situation as &quot;the toughest thing I&#x27;ve ever been through in the business&quot;, adding that &quot;it shook [him] to the core&quot;.

After departing Warner Bros., Ostin went on to join the music division of the entertainment conglomerate DreamWorks SKG in October 1995. In 2003, Ostin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Paul Simon, Neil Young, and Lorne Michaels. Three years later, he received The Recording Academy President&#x27;s Merit Award at the 2006 Grammy Salute to Industry Icons.

===Philanthropy===
A graduate of UCLA, Ostin and his wife Evelyn donated $10 million and played a critical role in establishing the university&#x27;s Evelyn and Mo Ostin Music Center, a state-of-the-art campus music facility. In March 2015, Ostin donated $10 million to UCLA for the Mo Ostin Basketball Center, a state-of-the-art training facility, which was opened in October 2017 and named in his honor.
He also sat on the board of visitors for the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture and the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music, and supported the UCLA Center for the Art of Performance.

==Personal life==
Ostin was married to Evelyn for 55 years until her death in 2005. Together, they had three children, Randy, Kenny, and Michael Ostin. All three worked as Warner executives. Both Kenny and Randy predeceased him in 2004 and 2013, respectively.

Ostin died in his sleep on July 31, 2022, at the age of 95.

<doc id="902872" wikidata="Q2069594" url="?curid=902872" title="People v. Collins">
<text>People v. Collins was a 1968 American robbery trial in California noted for its misuse of probability and as an example of the prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy.

==Trial==
After a mathematics instructor testified about the multiplication rule for probability, though ignoring conditional probability, the prosecutor invited the jury to consider the probability that the accused (who fit a witness&#x27;s description of a black male with a beard and mustache and a Caucasian female with a blond ponytail, fleeing in a yellow car) were not the robbers, suggesting that they estimated the probabilities as:

The jury returned a guilty verdict.

==Appeal==
The California Supreme Court set aside the conviction, criticizing the statistical reasoning for ignoring dependencies between the characteristics, e.g., bearded men commonly sport mustaches, and for drawing an incorrect statistical inference. This mistaken inference, commonly called the prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy, incorrectly equates the probability that a random defendant has a specific combination of traits with the chance that the defendant is innocent.

The Court said of the fallacy &quot;we think that the entire enterprise upon which the prosecution embarked, and which was directed to the objective of measuring the likelihood of a random couple possessing the characteristics allegedly distinguishing the robbers, was gravely misguided. At best, it might yield an estimate as to how infrequently bearded Negroes drive yellow cars in the company of blonde females with ponytails.&quot;

The court noted that the correct statistical inference would be the probability that no &quot;other&quot; couple who could have committed the robbery had the same traits as the defendants given that at least one couple had the identified traits. The court noted, in an appendix to its decision, that using this correct statistical inference, even if the prosecutor&#x27;s statistics were all correct and independent as he assumed, the probability that the defendants were innocent would be over 40%.

The court asserted that mathematics, &quot;...while assisting the trier of fact in the search of truth, must not cast a spell over him.&quot; In particular, the court expressed its concern that complex mathematics would distract the jury from weighing the credibility of witnesses and the reasonableness of their doubts. The court also expressed concern that if mathematics became common tools for prosecutors that there would not be enough defense attorneys skilled at mathematics to put on a skilled defense.

<doc id="902873" wikidata="Q2681562" url="?curid=902873" title="Elba Esther Gordillo">
<text>Elba Esther Gordillo Morales (; 6 February 1945) is a Mexican politician and trade unionist who has been the leader of the 1.4-million-strong National Education Workers&#x27; Union (&quot;Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación&quot;, or SNTE), the largest labor union in Latin America, since 1989. She was formerly affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (&quot;Partido Revolucionario Institucional&quot;, or PRI) until 2005, when she left and founded the New Alliance Party (&quot;Partido Nueva Alianza&quot;, or PANAL), which is currently led by Luis Castro Obregón.

Gordillo was arrested by the Mexican authorities on 26 February 2013 on charges of embezzlement and organized crime. She was included in a list of the &quot;10 most corrupt Mexicans&quot; published by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2013.

Gordillo has held considerable influence over governments and individual presidents by persuading her union members to vote as a single bloc.

==Early life==
Elba Esther Gordillo was born on 6 February 1945, in Comitán, Chiapas.

==Career==
Gordillo joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1970, at the height of its &quot;dirty war&quot;. She has occupied several PRI positions including Secretary of Organization of the National Executive Council (1986–1987), General Secretary of the Council of National Popular Organizations (1997–2002), and General Secretary of the National Executive Council, the second highest position within the party.

Gordillo then became one of the most powerful women in Mexican politics. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the DF&#x27;s 2nd district in 1985, she was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1987. She was the head of the PRI faction in the Chamber of Deputies, but after a political war with Roberto Madrazo, she lost that position when a slim majority of 118 PRI deputies voted to oust Gordillo as head of their 224-seat faction in the lower house. Gordillo was forced out of the congress leadership presumably because her political ambitions clashed with those of Madrazo regarding the presidential elections of 2006. Heightened political pressure and illness pushed Gordillo out from public life for about a year, though she did hold on to her post as the PRI general secretary.

In early 2005 Gordillo returned to public life and Roberto Madrazo greeted her with open arms. According to PRI rules, Gordillo, as secretary general of the party, should have replaced Madrazo when he stepped down; but, in a surprise move, Mariano Palacios Alcocer took Madrazo&#x27;s position instead of Gordillo, who publicly broke with Madrazo just few days before Palacios Alcocer&#x27;s election. Gordillo accused Madrazo of trying to bribe her with the party&#x27;s presidency in exchange for supporting his candidacy; she also said that Madrazo had no respect for democracy and just wanted to assure himself of the nomination and was breaking party rules to impose a party leader of his own choosing.

The day that Mariano Palacios Alcocer was back, Gordillo filed a complaint with a federal electoral tribunal asking for protection of her political rights, but the tribunal ruled against her. On 19 September and as a result of the dispute with Madrazo, Gordillo resigned her general secretary position in the PRI but decided to continue her affiliation with the party. On 13 July 2006, two weeks after the federal elections, the PRI announced her expulsion from its ranks for having supported the National Action Party (PAN) and for attacking and slandering the PRI&#x27;s leaders and candidates.

===Corruption===
Gordillo holds significant powers from the national public schools system dominated by her union in which teaching positions could be sold or inherited. There are roughly 1.5 million teachers in this union which she has controlled since 1989. 
In 2008, she was reportedly caught on camera having bought 59 new Hummer vehicles to give her aides, only to raffle them off when the media brought the purchase to light.

Gordillo is notorious for wearing luxury brands such as Hermès and Chanel. She has allegedly spent US$2.1 million at a Neiman Marcus department store in San Diego between March 2009 and January 2012. Gordillo allegedly used the money on properties, including in the US, a private jet, art work and plastic surgeries. She has allegedly amassed some 10 properties, including a US$1.7 million home in San Diego and a $4 million water-front house in Coronado, California.

Gordillo allegedly set up a political party that followed principles of a patronage system in 2005 that became notorious for obtaining privileges and appointments in return of its support in key elections. It was widely speculated that she helped Felipe Calderón obtain his narrow victory for the presidency in 2006 as part of a deal that allowed her to place individuals in the government who held allegiances to her.

The former union leader was formally charged in February 2013 with embezzling US$200 million from the union to fund her lavish lifestyle. She is notorious for her expensive Hermès bags as well as numerous plastic surgeries from clinics in California. She is believed to own or be connected to three residences in California. One of these, where she spent most of her time before her arrest, was a $4.7 million house in Coronado Cays with a private dock, a boat, and Jet Ski.

Gordillo was arrested on corruption charges by the Mexican authorities on 26 February 2013 after her private jet in which she had travelled from California landed at the Toluca airport near the capital. She was arrested for allegedly embezzling 2 billion pesos (US$156,816,000 or €119,242,600) from the Mexican National Educational Workers Union (SNTE), according to Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam. She also allegedly wired large sums of money to Swiss bank accounts, while other funds were used for plastic surgeries or personal luxuries. Among other questionable expenditures, according to Murillo Karam, were the maintenance and rental expenses of a hangar and aircraft. Prosecutors argue she would not have been able to make several purchases on her salary. (31,398 pesos or US$2,459 per month.) She has been charged with embezzlement and organized crime. To head her criminal defense, Gordillo hired prominent penal lawyer Marco Antonio del Toro Carazo who is also defending labor leader Napoleón Gómez Urrutia.

==Liberation==
Gordillo was liberated after a federal judge from the Primer Tribunal Unitario dismissed the trial on the grounds of not being able to prove Gordillo&#x27;s responsibility for embezzlement.

<doc id="902880" wikidata="Q4403717" url="?curid=902880" title="USS McKean (DD-90)">
<text>USS &quot;McKean&quot; (DD-90/APD-5) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the first ship named in honor of William Wister McKean.

&quot;McKean&quot; was laid down by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California on 12 February 1918. The ship was launched on 4 July 1918, sponsored by Miss Helen La Monte Ely. The ship was commissioned at San Francisco on 25 February 1919.

==Service history==
&quot;McKean&quot; served in the Atlantic from 1919 to 1922, made a cruise to European waters between May and July 1919, operated primarily out of New York and Charleston. The ship was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 19 June 1922. Reclassified as a high speed transport, APD-5 on 2 August 1940, she recommissioned at Norfolk on 11 December 1940 and resumed duty with the fleet.

===World War II===
Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific on 7 December 1941, &quot;McKean&quot; departed the east coast on 10 May 1942 and reached the South Pacific on 20 July to prepare for the invasion of the Solomons. She landed troops at Tulagi on 7 August and during the next several months made escort and supply runs from bases in New Caledonia and the New Hebrides to American positions in the southern Solomons in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. She departed the South Pacific on 31 January 1943, and after completing a cruise to the west coast for , she resumed escort and patrol operations between the New Hebrides and the Solomons on 21 June. Between July and November, she took part in amphibious operations in the central Solomons, landing troops at beachheads on New Georgia and Rendova. In addition she patrolled the waters off Guadalcanal and up the Slot to New Georgia.

In October, she completed preparations for operations in the Treasury Islands and Bougainville. She landed fighting men on Mono Island 27 October, including a construction team which installed a vital search radar in less than a week&#x27;s time. Following the American naval victory over Japanese forces in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay during the darkness of 2 November, &quot;McKean&quot; steamed with a reinforcement convoy to Bougainville and on the 6th landed Marines near Cape Torokina, Empress Augusta Bay. She carried additional troops to Bougainville 11 November, thence returned to Guadalcanal for yet another troop run.

With 185 marines embarked, &quot;McKean&quot; sailed up the slot on 15 November. As she approached Empress Augusta Bay on the 17th, she was attacked by a Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; torpedo plane of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service&#x27;s 702 &quot;Kōkūtai&quot;, which launched a torpedo off the starboard quarter. &quot;McKean&quot; turned to avoid the weapon; but at 0350 the torpedo struck the starboard side, exploding the after magazine and depth charge spaces and rupturing fuel oil tanks. Flaming oil engulfed &quot;McKean&quot; aft of the No. 1 stack, and she lost all power and communications. Burning oil on the water killed men who were blown or jumped overboard. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Ralph L. Ramey, ordered her abandoned at 0355; at 0400 she began to sink by the stern. He went over the side 12 minutes later; her forward magazine and oil tank exploded at 0415; and her stacks disappeared at 0418. 64 of her complement and 52 of her embarked troops died from the explosions or flames. The survivors were picked up by rescuing destroyers, the and USS &quot;Talbot&quot; (APD-7) which were alongside for approximately two hours trying to rescue survivors.

==Awards==
&quot;McKean&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service. &quot;McKean&quot; received the Navy Unit Commendation award.
Four US Coast Guard sailors, assigned to serve as coxswains of four landing craft working from the &quot;McKean&quot; earned Silver Stars during the amphibious assault on Tulagi.

==History==


Known as &quot;Karanitis&quot; (), &quot;Arzen&quot;, &quot;Erzen&quot;, and (Armenian:&quot;Էրզրում նահանգ, Կարին&quot; ) &quot;Karin&quot; or &quot;Garin&quot;, most of the province was incorporated into the Roman Empire in the 4th century (after the first split of Kingdom of Armenia in 387 between Romans and Iran), and a small mountain city called &quot;Karin (&quot;) or &quot;Carana&quot; () was fortified. It became an important border fortress. This city was later (A.D. 415) renamed to Theodosiopolis (), in honour of Emperor Theodosius I. Standing on the crossroads of main trade routes in Asia Minor, the area was a centre of importance for Greeks, with Armenian majority and minorities like Syriac Christians, Jews, Assyrians and other. From the mid 3rd century AD and afterwards, the territory was dominated by and incorporated into the Sasanian Empire, although it occasionally briefly fell under the rule of the neighboring Byzantine Empire as well. From the mid 7th century AD, the Arabs frequently clashed with the Byzantine Empire, including over the region. Between the seventh and eighth centuries, Arabs and Byzantines alternately held the region in their power, local Armenian rulers played a significant role in these events. The city (present day Erzurum) was alternatively held by the Arabs and Byzantines during the 7-10th centuries it was also part of the Georgian kingdom of Tao-Klarjeti in the 10th century. Threatened and later devastated and looted by the Seljuk Turks in 1049, the old city of Erzen was conquered, but Theodosiopolis survived the invasion until it was captured some time later. From the year 1101 onward it is documented that the ruling dynasty of the Saltukids held the town and much of the surrounding area in their power. Theodosiopolis repelled many attacks and military campaigns by the Seljuks of Rum and Georgians (the latter knew the city as Karnu-Kalaki) until 1201 when the city and province were conquered by the Seljuk sultan Süleiman II of Rüm. Erzen-Erzurum fell to the Mongol siege in 1242, and the city was looted and devastated. After the fall of the Seljuk Sultanate of Anatolia (Rum) in the early 14th century, it became an administrative province of the Ilkhanate, and after their fall, became part of the Çoban beylik, Black Sheep Turkmen, Mongols led by Timur Lenk, the White Sheep Turkmen and the rising Iranian Safavids captured the town in 1502 from the Aq Qoyunlu.

=== In the Ottoman Empire ===
In 1514, the region was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I following the Battle of Chaldiran. During the Ottoman reign, the city Erzurum served as the main base of Ottoman military power in the region and as the capital of the province. Early in the 17th century, the province was threatened again and taken by Safavid Iran while enduring also a revolt by the province governor Abaza Mehmed Pasha. This revolt was combined with Jelali Revolts (the uprising of the provincial musketeers called the &quot;Celali&quot;), backed by Safavid Iran and lasted until 1628. However, Iran would reconquer it again, only this time under Nader Shah in the first half of the 18th century.
The Ottomans were routed by the Iranian Qajars in the 1821 battle at the city of Erzurum. The city was conquered by the Russian army in 1829, given back to the Ottoman Empire with the Treaty of Adrianople (Edirne). The poet Alexander Pushkin accompanied the Russian commander-in-chief, Ivan Paskevich, during that expedition and penned a brief account of the campaign. The city was again assaulted by the Russian army in the last Russo-Turkish War in 1877.

Beginning in late 1914 and picking up in the summer of 1915, the province saw the wholesale extermination of the Armenian population by state-sponsored forces as part of the Armenian genocide.

The province was the site of the major fighting during Caucasus Campaign of World War I between Russian and Ottoman forces including the key confrontation of the campaign, Battle of Erzurum which resulted in capture of Erzurum by Russian army under the command of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich on 16 February 1916. It was returned to the Ottomans with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918. Erzurum was also a main Turkish base during the Turkish War of Independence and the Erzurum congress of Turkish nationalists was held here in 1919. It was declared a province of Turkey in 1924.

=== In Turkey ===
In September 1935 the third Inspectorate General (&quot;Umumi Müfettişlik,&quot; UM) was created. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars Gümüşhane, Erzincan and Ağrı. Its capital was to be in the city of Erzurum and it was governed by an Inspector General. The Inspectorate General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.

==Economy==

Historically, Erzurum produced wheat and linseed; as of 1920, annual production of linseed grossed between 1,000 and 1,500 tons. Honey was also produced for local use.

Approximately 18.5% of the total surface area is arable land, of which about 75% has permanent crops. A large portion of the agricultural produce comprises cereals. Forested areas occupy 8.8% of the total surface area, with forestry a local industry. Industries largely consist of manufacturing of forestry, agriculture, husbandry, chemistry, textile and mining products. There are 81 active industrial plants in the province, most of them located at the central district of Erzurum, and are small and medium enterprises. Due to their relatively small sizes, these industries mainly serve local markets causing lower capacity usage, low productivity and unemployment. About 40 plants are currently out of use, mostly due to high operating costs.

The province of Erzurum has the highest ratio of meadows and pastures in Turkey, ideal for livestock. However, once the main occupation, animal husbandry lost its importance in the 1980s with the introduction of a liberal economy and the importation of animal products. A large organized industrial park concentrating on processing meat is being built with the hope of reviving this sector. Food industries include beekeeping and trout farming.

Mining resources include lead, copper, chromium, and zinc, the reserves of which are almost exhausted. There is a considerable amount of lignite, however because its ash and sulfur ratios are high, it suitable only for industrial use. Magnesite, fire clay, gypsum, manganese, diatomite, marble, rock salt and perlite are also present. The few natural geothermal resources, except one, are not suitable for economic investments, and they are used as natural springs.

The gross domestic product GDP of Erzurum is US$1.16 billion, constituting less than 1% of the total and ranking 40th among Turkish provinces (1997 values).

Transportation is possible via paved and unpaved highways. The Erzurum international airport is open for commercial flights and is also used by the Turkish Air Force. The runways of this airport are the second longest in Turkey. Erzurum is also the main railroad hub in the Eastern Anatolia Region.

The largest contributor to the provincial economy, in recent years, has been Atatürk University, which is also one of the largest universities in Turkey, having more than forty thousand students. Tourist activities, which include skiing, rafting, and mountaineering, also provide a substantial proportion of the province&#x27;s income. Skiing is centered on Palandöken Mountain.

<text>The UMass Chan Medical School is a public medical school in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is part of the University of Massachusetts system. It consists of three schools: the T.H. Chan School of Medicine, the Morningside Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and the Tan Chingfen Graduate School of Nursing. The school also operates a biomedical research enterprise and a range of public-service initiatives throughout the state.

==History==
The University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) was established by the 162nd Massachusetts General Court in 1962 to provide residents of the commonwealth an opportunity to study medicine at an affordable cost and to increase the number of primary-care physicians practicing in the commonwealth&#x27;s under-served areas. The legislation was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor John Volpe. The School of Medicine accepted its first class of 16 students in 1970. Six years later a 371-bed hospital opened on campus; the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences opened in 1979, and the Graduate School of Nursing opened in 1986.

In 1998 the UMMS system of hospitals and clinics merged with Memorial Health Care to form UMass Memorial Health Care, the largest health-care provider in Central Massachusetts and clinical partner of UMMS.

===Name change===
In 2021 an unrestricted $175 million gift from the family of Hong Kong real estate developer Chan Tseng-hsi resulted in the name of the medical school, along with the biosciences and nursing schools, to be changed.

===Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research===

The research mission at UMMS was augmented in 1997 with the acquisition of the financially ailing Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research, the Shrewsbury, Massachusetts institution where researchers developed the combined oral contraceptive pill during the early 1960s.

==Academics==

===School of Medicine===
Accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the T.H. Chan School of Medicine grants the MD degree to its graduates. With the exception of MD/PhD students, degree candidates were formerly required to be Massachusetts residents, a policy which has changed beginning with the entering class of 2016. Approximately 165 students enroll annually, and more than 4,350 students have received medical degrees from UMMS. The School of Medicine has gained a national reputation for its primary-care program and consistently ranks in the top 10 percent of schools in the annual &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; guide, &quot;America’s Best Graduate Schools&quot;. SCImago Journal Rank listed the university at No. 74 in the US and No. 248 globally. Over half of each graduating class enters primary-care residencies, a trend underscoring the school&#x27;s founding mission, though that figure has decreased in recent years. In addition, a high number of graduates practice throughout the state. UMass Medical is also accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

===Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences===
The Morningside Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) is a PhD-granting program that trains scientists in a specialty area with a broad background in the basic medical sciences in preparation for conducting research with direct relevance to human disease. According to the GSBS website, the school offers students a multidisciplinary program of study, in which they have freedom of choice in curriculum and in the selection of mentors for their graduate-thesis research. Since the first class of seven students enrolled in 1979, more than 1000 students have earned PhDs from the GSBS.

===Graduate School of Nursing===
Since the opening of the Tan Chingfen Graduate School of Nursing (GSN) in 1986, more than 600 students have obtained a nursing master&#x27;s, post-master&#x27;s or doctoral degree from the school. The GSN prepares professional and advanced practice nurses, nurse scientists and educators as leaders in nursing and health-care delivery to diverse populations through education, research, practice and service (according to the GSN website).

==Research==
UMMS researchers have made advances in a broad range of disease families, from HIV and infectious diseases to cancer, genetic disorders, diabetes and immune disease. UMMS faculty discovered the link between the immune system and type-1 diabetes, found the genetic cause underlying the third-most-common form of the muscular dystrophies, and established the fundamental difference between HIV and other retroviruses.

In the 1990s. UMMS Professor of Medicine Shan Lu, leader of the UMMS DNA-based flu vaccine efforts, worked to advance the development of a potential avian-flu vaccine. Lu&#x27;s team has also been recognized for its work in the creation of an HIV vaccine, which in Phase I testing was found to generate antibody and T-cell responses in otherwise healthy people not infected with HIV. In 1998, UMMS researcher Craig Mello (an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute) and his colleague Andrew Fire (of Stanford University, then of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.) discovered RNA interference (RNAi). They demonstrated that small pieces of double-stranded RNA had interfered with the expression of a gene whose coding sequence of DNA was similar to that of the RNA they tested. Mello and Fire received the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries related to RNA interference.

Federal and private research grants and contracts at UMCMS rose from about $2 million in 1977 to more than $322 million in 2022 an increase of over 16,000% over forty-five years.

===MassBiologics===
MassBiologics is the only publicly owned, non-profit FDA-licensed manufacturer of vaccine and other biologic products in the United States. First established in 1894, the University of Massachusetts Biologic Laboratory was re-established in 1997 by the Massachusetts legislature, and oversight was transferred from the Department of Public Health to UMMS.

In recent years, MassBiologics has been called upon to respond to the threat of SARS, avian flu, and rabies. MassBiologics has developed or collaborated on five “orphan products” over the past twenty years. MassBiologics continues to market its FDA-licensed Td (tetanus and diphtheria) vaccine, providing a substantial proportion of the U.S. requirement for this vaccine. MassBiologics participates in the discovery, production and clinical testing of monoclonal antibodies (including antibodies to Clostridioides difficile), antibodies now known as actoxumab and bezlotoxumab In 2005, the firm opened an $80 million facility for monoclonal-antibody production. Co-developed with Serum Institute of India, it invented a fast-acting anti-Rabies drug called Rabies Human Monoclonal Antibody (RMAb).

UMMS is extending its mission of public service through its Commonwealth Medicine initiative.

<text>Within the Woods is a 1978 horror short film written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film &quot;Clockwork&quot;, deciding to produce a proof of concept horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for $1,600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods.

Raimi convinced a local theater manager to screen the film alongside &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, which sparked minor interest. Initially a meagre success, the film screened well to test audiences and inspired a larger budget remake directed by Raimi, called &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981). The film was the first in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; franchise, and launched the careers of both Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi. Several of the aesthetic qualities found in &quot;Within the Woods&quot; later defined Raimi&#x27;s films.

==Plot==

Two romantic couples, consisting of four teenagers, decide to spend a weekend together located in a remote cabin found in the woods. An unseen force stalks and watches the group without their knowledge. Ellen and her boyfriend Bruce enter the woods to have a picnic lunch whilst the other couple, Scotty and Shelly, remain at the cabin, playing Monopoly to pass the time. During their lunch, Bruce announces to Ellen that they&#x27;re camping on an Indian burial ground. Ellen is concerned, but Bruce assures her that they will be fine as long as they don&#x27;t disturb the graves of the dead. Bruce then explores the area and discovers an ancient dagger belonging to the Native Americans. Ignoring his own advice, he takes the dagger with him.

After lunch, Ellen takes a nap. When she awakes, she finds Bruce missing and wanders into the woods looking for him. To her horror, she finds Bruce&#x27;s dead body, horribly mutilated with apparent knife wounds. She is then startled by the presence of a demonic entity hiding within the woods, and quickly runs back to the cabin. While fleeing, she is attacked by unseen forces. Running back to the cabin, she screams to be let in and bursts through the door just as the entity closes in. Ellen tells her friends that Bruce has been murdered, but Scotty dismisses the whole thing as a joke and goes to find Bruce. Shelly and Ellen are concerned when Scotty doesn&#x27;t return right away. Shelly heads out to search for the missing men, but a possessed Bruce assaults and strangles her, eventually stabbing her in the neck and killing her with the dagger that he found, moaning &quot;join us.&quot;

Ellen encounters her possessed friend and flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts to enter the room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce, but manages to trap him outside, stabbing his hand several times in the process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking down, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun and going back up, she discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.

Ellen attempts to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who thrashes her around the cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce&#x27;s mutilated hand, still clutching the dagger from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce. Gushing blood, Bruce lies motionless for a moment, only to recommence his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruce&#x27;s body even further with an axe, chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth, muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving her fate ambiguous.

==Production==

===Background===

Before the development stages of &quot;Within the Woods&quot;, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were long-time friends who had grown up together. The duo had produced several low-budget films with super 8 mm film during their youth. During the early parts of Raimi&#x27;s career, he directed films that were mostly classified as comedies, such as &quot;Booby Bartenders&quot;, &quot;Shemp Eats the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Great Bogus Monkey Pignut Swindle&quot;. While those films were described as &quot;goofy&quot; and primitive by members of the cast and crew, Raimi eventually produced the short film &quot;It&#x27;s Murder!&quot;, which featured mostly comedic moments. One of the sequences of the film involved a suspenseful moment where a criminal jumped on an unsuspecting individual. Raimi later dismissed the short film, but complimented that scene, stating that it was &quot;the only part of &quot;It&#x27;s Murder!&quot; that really worked well.

While working on the film, it inspired Raimi to approach the horror genre with more enthusiasm, leading to the conception of his next short film &quot;Clockwork&quot;. The film featured a woman being stalked by a demented man, and launched an interest in Raimi to pursue working on more horror films. While both Raimi and Campbell expressed a positive opinion on the genre, they admitted they had little experience with the genre and went to drive-in theaters to research various science fiction and horror films. Raimi developed the motto &quot;the gore the merrier&quot; during these sessions at the drive-in, and quickly developed an interest in films featuring high levels of blood. Raimi gained an appeal in B movie cinema, which led him to want to pursue the production of a more ambitious film for his next project. In order to gain the interest of producers, Raimi and Campbell set out to produce a &quot;prototype&quot; film that would serve as a showcase of their talents. The film would work as a trailer to help promote further cinematic productions.

The prototype film was called &quot;Within the Woods&quot;. In addition to Raimi&#x27;s interest in various horror films, one of the main inspirations came in the writing of H. P. Lovecraft, who introduced the concept of the &quot;book of the dead&quot; to Raimi. Raimi studied the concept of magical books, in particular the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, which formed the basis of the film. Campbell described the film as a combination of &quot;creative writing and ancient history&quot;. In order to flesh out of the idea, Raimi came up with a concept where a group of teenagers went into the woods and were attacked by demonic spirits, summoned by the disturbance of an Indian burial ground. The book of the dead concept was not present in the finished film, but appeared extensively in later films by Raimi.

===Filming===

Raimi was able to secure $1,600 to produce the film. Raimi and Campbell collected a group of their friends and family who were interested in participating in the production of the film. The film was primarily shot at a farm house belonging to one of Raimi&#x27;s friends located in Marshall, Michigan. One of the regular actors involved with Raimi&#x27;s early short films, Ellen Sandweiss, was cast as the film&#x27;s protagonist. This decision stemmed from the notion that most horror films at the time involved female leads, who were more enjoyable to watch terrorized. The current boyfriend of Sandweiss was cast as the film&#x27;s antagonist, a demon who threatens the cast. Campbell was cast as one of the protagonists, though he initially was not familiar with horror cinema and instead identified as a fan of comedies. One of the films that inspired Campbell&#x27;s interest in the genre was John Carpenter&#x27;s film &quot;Halloween.&quot; Another Raimi regular, Scott Spiegel, was also cast as a protagonist based on his prior collaborations with the group.

The effects of the film were entirely low-budget. Nearly every effect in the film was done via things picked up at a make-up and Halloween store located close to where the film was shot. The effects in the film were notably more intricate than the simple ones featured in Raimi&#x27;s prior projects, and contained mutilated bodies, stabbed body parts and demonic possession skin-attachments. Tom Sullivan was one of the primary make-up supervisors on set, and he found it difficult working presentable effects out of such low budgets. One notable example involved a chest stabbing rig that had to be attached to Spiegel&#x27;s chest by straps and duct tape.

Campbell had to sleep wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that required to be shot in both the day and the night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually &quot;changed shape&quot; because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with &quot;bizarre&quot; ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, &quot;taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.

===Post-production===

Though production was difficult for many of the actors involved, especially Campbell, the film was eventually completed within acceptable budget limits. Raimi had completed the filming of his &quot;prototype&quot; and sought out to develop and edit the film as cheaply as possible. Though at the time it was unknown how the film was going to be distributed. Raimi had shot the film in the same style as many of his earlier films, with 8 mm film. He intended to blow the footage up after filming to the industry standard of 35mm in order to save money, though Campbell noted that the idea was without precedent. Though the request was &quot;obscure&quot; in nature, a company in San Francisco managed to accommodate the task with little difficulty. At a test screening at a local movie theater, the footage appeared to be mostly acceptable, though further tests showed it to be grainy and difficult to make out.

==Distribution and reception==
After production, Raimi virtually had no idea how the film was going to be distributed and what would come of it. The main idea behind shooting the film was to make a trailer to show to future investors, but even that was proving to be difficult. Eventually, Raimi got in contact with a manager at a movie theater in Detroit who was &quot;open and flexible&quot;. The same theater played &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; every single week and was open to more unusual cinema. To Raimi&#x27;s shock, the manager agreed to screen &quot;Within the Woods&quot; right before a midnight showing of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. The premiere of the film received a positive reception by the audience, and the cast and crew was paid just over $10, all of which was donated to the American Cancer Society. The film, however, was never commercially released.

While critics mostly ignored the locally distributed, low-budget horror film, local &quot;The Detroit News&quot; critic Michael McWilliams, who attended the film&#x27;s premiere, wrote that &quot;it will probably never be advertised alongside the glossy, big-budget horror movies of our time, but you won&#x27;t easily forget a locally produced little film called &quot;Within the Woods&quot;&quot;. He compared the low-budget film to the blockbuster &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;, writing that it provided more scares. Tom Sulivan, the make-up supervisor of the film, stated that the film &quot;really packs a punch&quot;, and expressed a positive opinion of working on the project.

==Aftermath==
In order to produce a follow-up picture, Raimi needed nearly $150,000. Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer to one of his friends, asking if he wanted to invest money into the production of a remake. Gillis was unimpressed with &quot;Within the Woods&quot;, but offered Raimi legal advice on how to approach further productions. Raimi approached several investors, &quot;begging&quot; for money, and eventually acquired nearly $90,000 of the funds needed and set out to make the movie anyway.
&quot;Within the Woods&quot; was later retooled by Raimi with a vastly higher production value and a full-length running time as the 1981 film &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;. &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; would go on to be the first installment of a film franchise spawning two sequels, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; (1987), and &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1992), both of which were directed by Raimi and featured Campbell as Ash Williams. A remake/sequel, known as &quot;Evil Dead&quot;, was released in 2013 with Raimi and Campbell as producers and creative consultants. In 2015, the Starz television network began airing the comedy horror series &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead&quot;, which featured Bruce Campbell returning as an older Ash Williams. Another movie in the series, &quot;Evil Dead Rise&quot;, was released in 2023, with Raimi and Campbell serving as executive producers.

Several aspects of &quot;Within the Woods&quot; were later presented in future Raimi films, including the use of the &quot;Raimi-cam&quot;, a camera rig that creates a fluent flow of camera movement. Other elements, such as graphic imagery, bleak endings, and mutilations, defined many of Raimi&#x27;s other films. Campbell made cameo appearances in all three of Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films, as well as several other films for Raimi.

Academy Award winning film-making duo the Coen brothers were inspired by Raimi&#x27;s decision to produce a short film as a trailer, utilizing the concept to produce funding for their debut &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984). The Coen brothers served as editors for &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, and developed a friendship with Raimi. The duo has cast Campbell in some of their films such as &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994) and &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), the former of which was co-written by Raimi.

<text>Białowieża is a village in Poland&#x27;s Podlaskie Voivodeship, in the middle of the Białowieża Forest, to which it gave its name. The village is some east of Hajnówka and southeast of the province capital, Białystok.

==Location==
Białowieża is in eastern Poland, in Podlaskie Voivodeship, near Poland&#x27;s border with Belarus. The nearest city is Białystok, the province capital. Białowieża is also connected to the town of Hajnówka, some away. The Narewka River flows through Białowieża.

Białowieża is the seat of the administrative district of Gmina Białowieża. Other villages in the district are Budy, Gródek, Pogorzelce, and Teremiski.

==History==


Before 1426, a wooden hunting lodge was built for King Władysław Jagiełło on the Łutownia River, in the middle of the Białowieża Forest. The lodge was probably one of the area&#x27;s first permanent settlements, though the forest had already been penetrated by hunters from nearby areas and by the King himself, who hunted there. The wooden lodge was painted white and became the namesake for both the future village and the forest (Białowieża means &quot;White Tower&quot; in Polish). 
From 1538 the forest was protected by the laws of King Sigismund I the Old. However, until the times of John Casimir the forest was mostly unpopulated. Sporadic settlements were established in various places, but the manor in Białowieża was the only one to be permanent. In the late 17th century, several small villages were started for development of local iron ore deposits and tar production. The villages were populated with settlers from Mazovia and Podlachia and many of them still exist.

At the end of the 16th century, probably around 1594, the royal court was moved to the area of today&#x27;s Białowieża Glade. According to the inventory from 1696, Białowieża was a 25-morgic farm in the period in question. In 1710 Białowieża was affected by a plague epidemic. The settlement and the royal hunting court were burnt down, and the residents who avoided infection moved to a new place. About the burned village is reminiscent of a wooden Orthodox cross set up by the Browska Road, which according to one version means the place where the wooden Orthodox church was located, according to the other, the place where the village once ended. In the mid-eighteenth century, August III built a new hunting palace in the area of today&#x27;s Palace Park, whose first description comes from an inventory from 1773. On September 27, 1752, August III organized a great hunt in the Białowieża Forest. To commemorate this event, a sandstone obelisk was erected near the palace, in which the names of the hunting entourage and the number of slaughtered animals were engraved in Polish and German. In 1765-1780 Białowieża was ruled by the Lithuanian court Treasurer Antoni Tyzenhauz. In 1784 King Stanisław August Poniatowski came to Białowieża. There were the last royal hunts in the Białowieża Forest.

As a result of the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Białowieża found itself within the borders of the Russian Empire (Russian partition of Poland). After the Partitions of Poland the local population was turned into serfs and Białowieża quickly depopulated. Tsar Alexander I reintroduced the reserve in 1801 and hired a small amount of peasants for protection of the animals. Most of them were settled in the administrative centre of the area – Białowieża. However, since most of the foresters took part in the November Uprising (500 out of 502 in total), their posts were abolished and protection was again harmed. Yet again the village of Białowieża ceased to exist. Protection was reintroduced in 1860 and the village was repopulated with Russians.

The rapid development of Białowieża took place after 1888, when the settlement was incorporated into tsarist estates. In 1889–1894 a large hunting palace was built, designed by Nicholas de Rochefort. A number of buildings were built in the vicinity of the palace: The Świcki (Hunting House) with comfortable, separate rooms, a common billiard room, baths for the tsar&#x27;s dawn (burned down in 1962), the Hofmarszałkowski House for court marshals (built in 1904), kitchen buildings, palace stable for 40 horses, laundry, telephone station, power plant (demolished in 1978), electric mill, house for servicing horses, house of the palace supervisor, house of shooters (built in 1904), woodcutter, cold store, bakery, house for preparation of forest animals, etc. As a result, a large housing estate was created. In 1895, an English-style palace park was created with an area of approximately 50 ha, designed by Walerian Kronenberg. At that time, another park with an area of 20 ha was established in another part of Białowieża, also according to the design of Kronenberg, surrounding the seat of the Board of the Appanaged Forest. Originally called a regiment, in the interwar period it received the name of the Directorate Park, which is preserved until today. Seven clerical houses were built in this area. In 1895, construction was completed and a new stone church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, located near the palace.

During World War I most of the local Eastern Orthodox (different nationalities) population fled before the advancing German army which seized the area in August 1915. Catholics remained in the village (being ethnic Poles, but also partly Orthodox Poles) The Germans built a lumber mill in Białowieża, connected to the nearby town of Hajnówka by a railway. However, the village did not recover until 1921 when the Białowieża National Park was established. The village became the administrative center of the Park and one of the most popular tourist attractions of the area. Following the Polish-Soviet War, Białowieża was returned to Poland.

On 1 September 1939, with the onset of World War II and joint German and Soviet attack on Poland, Luftwaffe bombed Bialowieza. The bombs seriously damaged the church and, to a lesser extent, a military field hospital located in one of the wings of the palace. Then Białowieża was taken over by the German 3rd Armoured Division. On September 16, Podlaska Cavalry Brigade entered Białowieża. On September 20, General Zygmunt Podhorski pseud. &quot;Zaza&quot; appointed from the gathered units of the Suwalska Cavalry Brigade and the Podlaska Cavalry Brigade the improvised Cavalry Division &quot;Zaza&quot; consisting of the Cavalry Brigade &quot;Pleats&quot; and the Cavalry Brigade &quot;Edward&quot;.

In accordance with Ribentrop-Molotov Pact, the area came under Soviet occupation and was declared part of the Belastok Region of the Belarusian SSR. In 1939 and 1940 many local inhabitants were arrested and deported to Siberia. Many were arrested and sent to the Gulag. They were replaced with Russian forest workers, but in 1941 the forest came under German occupation and the Russian inhabitants were also deported. Hermann Göring planned to create the biggest hunting reserve in the world there, but those plans were never realized. After July 1941, the forest became a refuge for both Polish and Soviet partisans. The German authorities organized mass executions of people suspected of aiding the resistance. In July 1944 the area was captured by the Red Army. The withdrawing Wehrmacht blew up the historic Białowieża hunting manor.

After the war Białowieża was transferred back to the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic, yet again recovered and in 1947 became the center of the re-established National Park. Nowadays it is one of the least populated areas in Poland, while at the same time it is one of the most important tourist attractions in the eastern part of the country with almost 100,000 visitors every year. The Reserve was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1992 and internationally recognized as a Biosphere Reserve under UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Program in 1993.

British historian Simon Schama devotes several chapters of his 1995 book &quot;Landscape and Memory&quot; to a consideration of the historical vicissitudes of the forests around Białowieża in an effort to explore the ways in which cultural imagination shapes humans&#x27; vision of the land.

==Demographics==
Today, the majority of the population of Białowieża is Eastern Orthodox mostly identifying themselves as Poles, with a small part identifying as members of the Belarusian ethnic minority. There is also a significant percentage of Catholics living in Białowieża. The local native dialect is described by linguists as being of Ruthenian origin, predominantly a mixture of Belarusian, Ukrainian with significant elements of Polish and a certain influence of the Russian language. However, this dialect is gradually disappearing and an increasing part of the population of Białowieża uses standard Polish or Podlasie-Polesian dialects of the Polish language.

===Jews===
Jewish community in Białowieża established in the late 19th century and shortly before World War I. M. Orlowicz reported that the synagogue was already in operation before 1914. Jews came to Białowieża at a time when the foundations of the timber industry were being laid in the settlement. In 1917, there were about 80 Jews living here, in 1921 217 Jews, and in 1937 4,000 Jews. The largest concentration of Jewish houses and squares was located along the main, Stoczek street. The main wooden synagogue and a private house of prayer were located on Stoczek Street. There was no Jewish cemetery in the town. Jews from Białowieża were buried in the Jewish cemetery in Narewka. There was also no rabbi. For special prayers, a rabbi would come from the surrounding settlements, most often from Narewka.

The main synagogue was built at the beginning of the 20th century and dismantled in the 1960s. It stood behind the &quot;Sarenka&quot; restaurant. During the German occupation it was used as a feed warehouse. Traces of the foundations was still visible in the 90s. The brick house of prayer was set up in a private house in the 1920s by a Jew who came from the Caucasus, located at 61 Stoczek Street.

<text>Paula Fletcher (born 1951) is a Canadian politician who has served on Toronto City Council since 2003. She currently represents Ward 14 Toronto—Danforth.

Fletcher is regarded as an advocate for affordable housing, environmentally sustainable policy, social justice and good land use planning. She describes her views as ascribing to progressive values.

==Early life and family==
Fletcher was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and moved to Toronto, then to Winnipeg, Manitoba, before again relocating to Toronto.

She now lives in Toronto with her husband John Cartwright and their two children. Her husband is a former president of the Toronto and York Region Labour Council. A carpenter by trade, Cartwright was formerly the Business Manager of the Construction Trades Council and co-chair of the Metro Jobstart Coalition. He has served on the Boards of the Waterfront Regeneration Trust, the United Way Toronto, the Toronto 2008 Olympic Bid, and the Labour Education Centre.

==Early career==
In Winnipeg, Fletcher worked as an educator in third world development, and became a community activist. She was a union organizer in a Toronto garment mill in the early 1970s. After working at the mill, she worked at the Downsview DeHavilland Plant. When she worked there, she went by the nickname &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;. At the DeHavilland plant, she was involved in the women&#x27;s committee of Canadian Auto Workers Local 112. In the 1990s, Fletcher worked at Toronto City Hall as executive assistant to city councillor Dan Leckie.

=== Politics ===
In 1980, she ran for the Winnipeg School Board for Ward 2, in the city&#x27;s north end. In 1981, she was elected leader of the Communist Party of Canada (Manitoba) and served as leader for five years. She ran in the 1981 and 1986 provincial elections in the Winnipeg riding of Burrows. She garnered 144 and 131 votes respectively, less than 2 per cent of the popular vote. In the early 1980s, she sang with a group called Rank and File. In 1986, Fletcher left the Communist Party and moved back to Toronto.

==== Toronto District School Board Trustee ====
In 2000, Fletcher was elected as a trustee for Ward 15 in the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). During her time on the board, she was active in fighting service cuts by the Mike Harris and Ernie Eves Progressive Conservative governments, and helped prevent two school closures in her area. One of them was Bruce Junior Public School, which Fletcher helped save by housing a new centre there for childhood learning and development for families.

== Toronto City Councillor ==

=== Election and early tenure ===
When Jack Layton resigned from council to run for the leadership of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Fletcher ran to replace him and received the endorsement of Layton (who was NDP leader by the time of the Toronto council election campaign) and the NDP, and Marilyn Churley, who was the NDP member of Provincial Parliament (MPP).

In the 2003 municipal election, eight candidates competed in Ward 30. Prominent candidates included Chris Phibbs, who was executive assistant to Toronto City Councillor Kyle Rae for 11 years, and Maureen Gilroy, a centrist candidate who had the backing of Liberal member of Parliament (MP) Dennis Mills. A key issue in the 2003 election was the proposed fixed link to the Toronto Island Airport that Fletcher opposed. Fletcher won with 39.5 per cent of the vote.

As a councillor, Fletcher rallied Toronto City Council to oppose the Portlands Energy Centre, a 550 megawatt power plant in the Port Lands district beside the Hearn Generating Station. The grassroots campaign was unable to stop construction of the plant, which was completed in 2007. Significant developments in Ward 30 that Fletcher supported include Filmport (now known as Pinewood Toronto Studios), which is Canada&#x27;s largest purpose-built sound stage and film production space, and the Zhong Hua Men Archway, the only traditional Chinese archway to be built in Toronto.

=== Re-election ===
In the 2006 municipal election, Fletcher ran in a field of six candidates. Fletcher won with 60.3 per cent of the vote.

During Fletcher&#x27;s second term, Fletcher served as the chair of the Parks and Environment Committee, where she spearheaded the City of Toronto&#x27;s Climate Change, Clean Air and Sustainable Energy Action Plan and Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and the People, Dogs and Parks – Off-Leash Areas and Commercial Dog Walker Permit Policy. She was also a member of the Mayor David Miller Executive Committee. She also served on the boards of Toronto Public Health and the Toronto Community Housing Corporation, and she chaired the Aboriginal Committee and the Animal Services sub-committee.

==== Leslieville Smart Centres development ====
In 2009, Fletcher campaigned against an application by SmartCentres to build a retail facility in the city&#x27;s &#x27;Studio District&#x27;. The development was proposed for lands occupied by Toronto Film Studios, which would have required a change in the zoning from industrial to retail. The proposal was denied on the grounds that the development would have destabilized the surrounding employment district. Smart Centres appealed the decision to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB). In March 2009, the OMB sided with city council. However, OMB vice-chair James McKenzie was critical of measures taken to block the proposal.

==== Budget 2010 outburst ====
On 2 March 2010, Fletcher &quot;interrogated&quot; a man who was identified as John Smith during deputations on the City of Toronto&#x27;s budget. In response to Smith&#x27;s criticisms, Fletcher wanted to know if he expected her to cut the arts budget, school breakfast programs, or subsidized daycare spots. Smith replied, &quot;Councillor, you&#x27;re asking me to do your job. Are you seeking re-election in [October]? You&#x27;re being paid to make tough decisions.&quot; After a further exchange, he added, &quot;You should be fired.&quot; Fletcher yelled back, &quot;Oh, come and run against me. Come on down, baby!&quot; Fletcher subsequently apologized for her comments, writing in a letter to Toronto City Council.

==== Bike lanes ====
Fletcher has been a strong advocate for better bike lane infrastructure in Toronto and supports bicycle lanes on Danforth Avenue. In 2014, she joined a number of other councillors on &quot;Bike to Work Day&quot;. In May 2010, however, Fletcher accidentally voted against a proposal to install bike lanes on University Avenue in downtown Toronto. The proposal failed on a 15–13 vote. She said she had intended to vote in favour of the proposal and cited fatigue and city hall technology for her mis-vote.

===Third term===
In the 2010 municipal election, Fletcher increased her vote to narrowly beat former CityTV reporter Liz West by less than 2 per cent of the votes cast. West&#x27;s campaign was buoyed by the support of mayoral candidate Rob Ford and his upsurge in the campaign that led to his election. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; reported that there was a strong desire for change in the ward that led to the close showing by West, who entered the race in mid-August. Third-place candidate Andrew James dropped out of the race and endorsed West prior to the election day. The Toronto and York Region Labour Council endorsed Fletcher and several other councillor and school trustee candidates.

=== Fourth term ===
Fletcher was re-elected in the 2014 municipal election, once again beating West and four other candidates.

=== Fifth term ===
Fletcher was re-elected in the 2018 municipal election, running in the newly created Ward 14, which includes much of her old ward. She ran against fellow councillor Mary Fragdakis.

<text>USS &quot;Harding&quot; (DD-91) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first ship named in honor of Seth Harding.

Launched in 1918, she undertook training exercises off the East Coast of the United States sporadically for several years. In 1919, she escorted a major transatlantic flight of Curtiss NC seaplane. Later that year, she was selected to be converted into a seaplane tender, and was then used to support naval aviator training off Naval Air Station Pensacola. She took one trip to Veracruz with emergency medical supplies, and was also on hand during aircraft bombing tests against decommissioned German ships, including the sinking of . She was decommissioned in 1922 and sold for scrapping in 1936.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Harding&quot; was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with seven of her sisters, were constructed at Union Iron Works shipyards in San Francisco, California using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel.

She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . On trials, &quot;Harding&quot; reached a speed of . She was armed with four 4&quot;/50 caliber guns, three .30 caliber machine guns, and twelve torpedo tubes Mark 15 torpedoes. She had a regular crew complement of 122 officers and enlisted men. She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers.

Specifics on &quot;Harding&quot;″s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers known unofficially as the &#x27;Liberty Type&#x27; to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The &#x27;Liberty&#x27; type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight.

&quot;Harding&quot; was the first ship to be named for Seth Harding. The second was a , commissioned in 1943.

==Service history==
&quot;Harding&quot; was launched on 4 July 1918 from Union Iron Works. She was sponsored by the wife of George A. Armes, and commissioned under the command of Commander Henry D. Cooke. On 3 February 1919, she was assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet and sailed for Newport, Rhode Island via Santa Cruz, California. Transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived on 18 February. Two days later she moved to Boston, Massachusetts and stood out of that harbor on 21 February, to escort which was transporting President Woodrow Wilson from the Versailles Conference. Two days later she participated in ceremonies in Boston harbor celebrating the arrival of that ship.

Next, she put in for repairs at Norfolk, Virginia until 8 March, when she left for fleet exercises near Cuba. Following this, &quot;Harding&quot; left for New York, arriving there on 14 April. On 1 May, she departed as part of a group of destroyers acting as a guide for a flight of Navy Curtiss NC seaplanes across the Atlantic Ocean. &quot;Harding&quot; provided searchlight illumination by night during the first part of the flight; NC-1 and NC-3 made forced landings near the Azores and &quot;Harding&quot; rendered assistance to NC-1 before it sank. NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and as she took off for the last leg of her journey, &quot;Harding&quot; got underway to provide radio compass signals at sea. After the seaplanes landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, &quot;Harding&quot; visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June. For several months, &quot;Harding&quot; was based out of Newport and Norfolk on training exercises.

After the end of World War I, the U.S. Navy began to convert surplus ships to support its growing seaplane tender program. Several steamers and minelayers were selected in 1919, but &quot;Harding&quot; was the only destroyer, because it was determined that she would require minimal modifications. Following this success, and as aircraft carrier designs advanced, more ships were designed specifically to support naval aviation. Fourteen &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers were converted to seaplane tenders in 1938 when it was determined that aircraft production was outpacing the development of these ships. During the conversion of &quot;Harding&quot;, her three .30 caliber machine guns were removed and her crew complement was reduced to 100 officers and enlisted men. Her torpedo tubes may also have been removed. On 13 December 1919, she reported to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion to a seaplane tender. She completed the conversion at Charleston Navy Yard and on 20 May 1920, she sailed for duty at Pensacola Naval Air Station. Immediately after this, though, &quot;Harding&quot; was loaded with medical supplies from the American Red Cross and was ordered to Veracruz, Mexico, where an outbreak of bubonic plague necessitated serum and other supplies. She reached Veracruz on 9 June 1920 and unloaded her supplies. She then steamed for Pensacola, Florida, stopping at Tampico on the way, and arrived in Florida on 13 June.

At Pensacola, &quot;Harding&quot; was assigned to a seaplane pilot training program. She remained there until 4 August 1920, after which she operated in the Caribbean area tending seaplanes until 23 February 1921. She stopped briefly at Philadelphia before heading to Hampton Roads to support bombing tests on surrendered German ships, leaving Norfolk on 21 June. She was present during the bombing tests on and remained assigned to the tests until the sinking of the German battleship on 21 July 1921. &quot;Harding&quot; was detached from this duty the next day.

&quot;Harding&quot; subsequently conducted training exercises out of Newport and other East Coast ports until 27 December 1921, when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina. Remaining there until 3 April 1922, she sailed to Philadelphia where she decommissioned 1 July 1922. &quot;Harding&quot; was then sold for scrap on 29 September 1936, to Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation in New York City.

<text>Gustave Reese ( ; November 29, 1899 – September 7, 1977) was an American musicologist and teacher. Reese is known mainly for his work on medieval and Renaissance music, particularly with his two publications &quot;Music in the Middle Ages&quot; (1940) and &quot;Music in the Renaissance&quot; (1954); these two books remain the standard reference works for these two eras, with complete and precise bibliographical material, allowing for almost every piece of music mentioned to be traced back to a primary source.

==Early life and education==
Reese was born in New York City on November 29, 1899. He was an avid scholar and had interests in many areas outside music, including art, architecture, and literature. He studied law at New York University, graduating in 1921. Though he was admitted to the New York State Bar, he opted to re-enroll and pursue a Bachelor of Music from NYU, which he received in 1930.

== Career ==
In 1927, however, he was already teaching classes at the university in medieval and Renaissance music. He continued teaching there intermittently until 1974, and he became Professor Emeritus in 1973. He also served as a visiting professor at a number of universities, including Harvard, Duke, UCLA, USC, Michigan, Oxford and the Juilliard School of Music. At his death he was still leading doctoral seminars in the Graduate School of the City University of New York. He was a founder-member of the American Musicological Society (AMS) from 1934, serving as its first secretary (1934–1946). He became vice-president in 1946 and president of the organization in 1950. He has also held positions in the International Musicological Society (IMS), the Renaissance Society of America, and the Plainsong and Medieval Music Society.

Also active in the music publishing industry, he headed the publication department of G. Schirmer (1940–1945) and was also director of publication at Carl Fischer (1945–1955). Furthermore, he was editor of &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; from 1944 to 1945.

Gustave Reese had a profound impact on many generations of music students through his passionate and insightful teaching. He has left a valuable legacy in &quot;Music in the Middle Ages&quot; and &quot;Music in the Renaissance&quot;. These two pillars have incited a revival of interest and scholarship in the areas of early music. He is often perceived to have &#x27;raised the bar&#x27; of musicological scholarship with his thorough research, intellectual rigour and comprehensive bibliographies. He commissioned other people to contribute specialist sections to these books, such as Igor Buketoff&#x27;s piece on Russian chant in &quot;Music in the Middle Ages&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Reese married Fine Arts administrator and cookbook author and editor Carol Truax in 1974. He died, aged 77, in Berkeley, California.

<doc id="902913" wikidata="Q1061759" url="?curid=902913" title="Chandos portrait">
<text>The Chandos portrait is an oil painted portrait thought to depict William Shakespeare (1564–1616). Painted between 1600 and 1610, it may have served as the basis for the engraved portrait of Shakespeare used in the &quot;First Folio&quot; in 1623. It is named after the 3rd Duke of Chandos, who formerly owned the painting. The portrait was given to the National Portrait Gallery, London on its foundation in 1856, and it was the first portrait to be acquired for its collection.

It has not been possible to determine with certainty who painted the portrait, or whether it really depicts Shakespeare. However, the National Portrait Gallery believes that it &quot;certainly fairly likely&quot; does depict the writer.

==Authorship and provenance==


The first known reference to the painting is in a note written in 1719 by George Vertue, who states that it was painted by John Taylor, a respected member of the Painter-Stainers&#x27; company who may also have been the same John Taylor who acted with the Children of Paul&#x27;s. Vertue refers to Taylor as an actor and painter and as Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;intimate friend&quot;. Katherine Duncan-Jones argues that &quot;John Taylor&quot; could have been a misreading of what had originally been &quot;Jo: Taylor&quot;; she suggests that this may refer to the actor Joseph Taylor, who was a protégé of the older Shakespeare.

In 1719, in a note in the margin of a book, George Vertue wrote the name &quot;Richard Burbridge&quot; [sic], then crossed it out. It is thought that Vertue temporarily and mistakenly assigned the painting to Shakespeare&#x27;s friend Richard Burbage (1567–1619), then crossed it out, and instead wrote that the painting was by &quot;one Taylor&quot;.

Vertue also states that before the Duke of Chandos acquired it, the portrait was owned by Shakespeare&#x27;s possible godson, William Davenant (1606–1668), who, according to the gossip chronicler John Aubrey, claimed to be the playwright&#x27;s illegitimate son. He also states that it was left to Davenant in Taylor&#x27;s will and that it was bought by Thomas Betterton from Davenant and then sold to the lawyer Robert Keck, a collector of Shakespeare memorabilia.

After Keck&#x27;s death in 1719, it passed to his daughter, and was inherited by John Nichol, who married into the Keck family. Nichol&#x27;s daughter Margaret married James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos. The painting passed through descent within the Chandos title until Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos sold it to the Earl of Ellesmere in 1848. Ellesmere donated it in 1856 to the National Portrait Gallery.

==Scholarly views==
An image that is definitively identifiable as a depiction of the playwright is the engraving in the posthumously published First Folio of 1623. It was created by Martin Droeshout and was probably commissioned by Shakespeare&#x27;s friends and family. It is considered likely that the Droeshout engraving is a reasonably accurate likeness of Shakespeare because of its acceptance by these close associates and that contemporaries such as Ben Jonson praised it at the time of the publication. Since the man in the Chandos portrait resembles the one in the Droeshout engraving, the similarity lends an indirect legitimacy to the oil painting. A further indication of legitimacy is the fact that the Chandos portrait was the inspiration for two posthumous portraits of Shakespeare, one by Gerard Soest and another, grander one, known as the &quot;Chesterfield portrait&quot; after a former owner of that painting. These were probably painted in the 1660s or 1670s, within living memory of Shakespeare. The Chesterfield portrait is held by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon.

In 2006, art historian Tarnya Cooper of the National Portrait Gallery completed a three-and-a-half-year study of portraits purported to be of Shakespeare and concluded that the Chandos portrait was most likely a representation of Shakespeare. Cooper points to the earring and the loose shirt-ties of the sitter, which were emblematic of poets (the poet John Donne and Shakespeare&#x27;s patron the Earl of Pembroke sported similar fashions). However, she readily acknowledges that the painting&#x27;s authenticity cannot be proven.

Cooper also notes that the painting has been badly damaged by over-cleaning and retouching. Parts are abraded and some parts have been slightly altered. The hair has been extended and the beard is longer and more pointed than when originally painted.

==Copies==

In addition to the Chesterfield portrait, a copy was made at least as early as 1689 by an unknown artist. Many 18th century images used it as a model for portrayals of Shakespeare.

The painting was engraved by Gerard Vandergucht for Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s 1709 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works. Another print was made by Jacobus Houbraken in 1747.

==Ethnic interpretations==
Because there are a lack of sources regarding Shakespeare&#x27;s appearance – no written contemporary descriptions of him are known to exist, and conflicting views regarding Shakespeare&#x27;s ethnicity were written about in the 19th and 20th centuries based on the painting (which themselves were based on phrenology). George Steevens said that the picture gave Shakespeare &quot;the complexion of a Jew, or rather that of a chimney sweeper in the jaundice&quot;. According to Ben Macintyre, &quot;Some Victorians recoiled at the idea that the Chandos portrait represented Shakespeare. One critic, J. Hain Friswell, insisted &#x27;one cannot readily imagine our essentially English Shakespeare to have been a dark, heavy man, with a foreign expression&#x27;.&quot; Friswell agreed with Steevens that the portrait had &quot;a decidedly Jewish physiognomy&quot; adding that it displayed &quot;a somewhat lubricious mouth, red-edged eyes&quot; and &quot;wanton lips, with a coarse expression.&quot; According to Ernest Jones, the portrait convinced Sigmund Freud that Shakespeare was French: &quot;He insisted that his countenance could not be that of an Anglo-Saxon but must be French, and he suggested that the name was a corruption of Jacques Pierre.&quot;

<doc id="902918" wikidata="Q410728" url="?curid=902918" title="Tetraethylammonium">
<text>Tetraethylammonium (TEA) is a quaternary ammonium cation with the chemical formula , consisting of four ethyl groups (, denoted Et) attached to a central nitrogen atom. It is a counterion used in the research laboratory to prepare lipophilic salts of inorganic anions. It is used similarly to tetrabutylammonium, the difference being that its salts are less lipophilic, more easily crystallized and more toxic.

==Preparation==
The halide salt is prepared by the reaction of triethylamine and an ethyl halide:

This method works well for the preparation of tetraethylammonium iodide (where X = I).

Most tetraethylammonium salts are prepared by salt metathesis reactions. For example, the synthesis of tetraethylammonium perchlorate, a salt that has been useful as a supporting electrolyte for polarographic studies in non-aqueous solvents, is carried out by mixing the water-soluble salts tetraethylammonium bromide and sodium perchlorate in water, from which the water-insoluble tetraethylammonium perchlorate precipitates:

Other examples include tetraethylammonium cyanide (), and trichlorostannate (). In some cases, salts are produced of anions that cannot be generated in water, such as the tetrahedral salt.

===Uses===
The principal chemical characteristic of tetraethylammonium salts is their ability to engage in processes involving phase-transfer, such as phase-transfer catalysis. Typically, the four ethyl groups surrounding the nitrogen are too small to facilitate efficient ion transfer between aqueous and organic phases, but tetraethylammonium salts have been found to be effective in a number of such applications, and these are exemplified under the headings of the individual salts.

TEA salts such as tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate and tetraethylammonium methylsulfonate are used in supercapacitors as organic electrolytes.

TEA halide and its hydroxide are used for the synthesis of high-silica zeolite, especially for the zeolite beta. TEA can act as a template for micropore of zeolites under hydrothermal conditions during crystallization processes.

===Properties===
The effective radius of the tetraethylammonium ion is reported as ~0.45 nm, which is comparable in size to that of the hydrated ion. The ionic radius for TEA is given as 0.385 nm; several thermodynamic parameters for the TEA ion are also recorded.

The octanol-water partition coefficient of TEA iodide, &quot;P&quot;o-w was determined experimentally to be (or ).

==Biology==
===Pharmacology===
The literature dealing with the pharmacologically-related properties of tetraethylammonium is vast, and research continues. It is clear that TEA blocks autonomic ganglia - it was the first &quot;ganglionic blocker&quot; drug to be introduced into clinical practice. However, TEA also produces effects at the neuromuscular junction and at sympathetic nerve terminals.

At the mechanistic level, TEA has long been known to block voltage-dependent K+ channels in nerve, and it is thought that this action is involved in the effects of TEA at sympathetic nerve terminals. With respect to activity at the neuromuscular junction, TEA has been found to be a competitive inhibitor at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, although the details of its effect on these receptor proteins are complex. TEA also blocks Ca2+ - activated K+ channels, such as those found in skeletal muscle and pituitary cells. It has also been reported that TEA inhibits aquaporin (APQ) channels, but this still seems to be a disputed issue.

A partial effect of these voltage-dependent and permeability properties within each system mentioned above is not only due to the aforementioned inhibitory properties of TEA, but also its ability to inhibit Na,K-ATPase. Acting on the extracellular vestibule of the Na,K-ATPase, inhibiting K+ access similar to ouabain, TEA further accentuates the disrupted K, and Na, gradients within each of these systems.

===Clinical considerations===
Although TEA (sometimes under the name &quot;Etamon&quot;) was explored in a number of different clinical applications, including the treatment of hypertension, its major use seems to have been as a probe to assess the capacity for vasodilation in cases of peripheral vascular disease. Because of dangerous, even fatal reactions in some patients, as well as inconsistent cardiovascular responses, TEA was soon replaced by other drugs.

TEA is not orally active. Typical symptoms produced in humans include the following: dry mouth, suppression of gastric secretion, drastic reduction of gastric motility, paralysis of urinary bladder, and relief of some forms of pain. Most studies with TEA seem to have been performed using either its chloride or bromide salt without comment as to any distinctions in effect, but Birchall and his co-workers preferred the use of TEA chloride in order to avoid the sedative effects of the bromide ion.

===Toxicology===
An extensive study of the toxicology of tetraethylammonium chloride in mice, rats and dogs was published by Gruhzit and co-workers in 1948. These workers reported the following symptoms in mice and rats receiving toxic parenteral doses: tremors, incoordination, flaccid prostration, and death from respiratory failure within 10–30 minutes; dogs exhibited similar symptoms, including incoordination, flaccid prostration, respiratory and cardiac depression, ptosis, mydriasis, erythema, and death from respiratory paralysis and circulatory collapse. After non-lethal doses, symptoms abated within 15–60 minutes. There was little evidence of toxicity from chronic administration of non-lethal doses. These investigators recorded the following acute toxicities, as LD50s for TEA chloride (error ranges not shown):

:Mouse: 65 mg/kg, i.p.; 900 mg/kg, p.o.

:Rat: ~56 mg/kg, i.v.; 110 mg/kg, i.m.; 2630 mg/kg, p.o.

:Dog: ~36 mg/kg, i.v.; 58 mg/kg, i.m.

Another research group, working at about the same time, but using tetraethylammonium bromide, published the following LD50 data:

:Mouse: 38 mg/kg, i.v.; 60 mg/kg, i.p.; &gt;2000 mg/kg, p.o.

:Rat: 63 mg/kg, i.v.; 115 mg/kg, i.p.

Writing in 1950, Graham made some observations on the toxic effects of tetraethylammonium bromide in humans. In one subject, described as a &quot;healthy woman&quot;, 300 mg of tetraethylammonium bromide, i.v., produced incapacitating &quot;curariform&quot; (i.e., resembling the effects of tubocurarine) paralysis of the skeletal muscles, as well as marked drowsiness. These effects were largely dissipated within 2 hours. Citing the work of other investigators, Graham noted that Birchall had also produced &quot;alarming curariform effects&quot; in humans with i.v. doses of 32 mg/kg of tetraethylammonium chloride.

<text>Rason (formerly Rajin-Sŏnbong; ) is a North Korean special city and ice-free port in the Sea of Japan in the North Pacific Ocean on the northeast tip of North Korea. It is in the Kwanbuk region and location of the Rason Special Economic Zone.

In South Korean pronunciation, the initial &quot;R&quot; of the name is pronounced as &quot;N&quot;, (나선, &quot;Naseon&quot;) as per standard Korean phonology. In 2000, the name was shortened from &quot;Rajin-Sŏnbong&quot; to &quot;Rason&quot;. During the 1930s, the Japanese called it Rashin; at that time, it was an important port at the end of a railroad line. It fell under the control of the Red Army on 14 August 1945.

Before 1991, Rason was used by the Soviet Union as an alternative warm-water port in case Vladivostok was unavailable. The Soviet naval facilities were built starting in 1979. From 1993 to 2004, it was administered separately from North Hamgyŏng as the directly governed city (&quot;chikhalsi&quot;) of Rason. Prior to 1993 and from 2004 to 2009, the city had been part of the North Hamgyŏng Province. Since 2010, the city is a &quot;special city&quot;, again breaking from provincial control, but different from its older designation as a directly governed city. What this means in practice is unclear.

Rason borders Hunchun county in Jilin province of China and Khasansky District in Primorsky Krai of Russia. China is making investments in the port as it gives it access to the Sea of Japan. In July 2011, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) gave a green light for China&#x27;s domestic trade cargo to be shipped via its port of Rajin from northeast to east China. Coal is shipped from nearby Chinese mines to Shanghai. A casino by the sea caters to Chinese visitors.

<doc id="902934" wikidata="Q1638575" url="?curid=902934" title="Hurricane Donna">
<text>Hurricane Donna, known in Puerto Rico as Hurricane San Lorenzo, was the strongest hurricane of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season, and caused severe damage to the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, and the East Coast of the United States, especially Florida, in August and September. The fifth tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, Donna developed south of Cape Verde on August 29, spawned by a tropical wave to which 63 deaths from a plane crash in Senegal were attributed. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Donna by the following day. Donna moved west-northwestward at roughly and by September 1, it reached hurricane status. Over the next three days, Donna deepened significantly and reached maximum sustained winds of on September 4. Thereafter, it maintained intensity as it struck the Lesser Antilles later that day. On Sint Maarten, the storm left a quarter of the island&#x27;s population homeless and killed seven people. An additional five deaths were reported in Anguilla, and there were seven other fatalities throughout the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, severe flash flooding led to 107 fatalities, 85 of them in Humacao alone.

Donna further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 6, and attained peak winds of twenty-four hours later. The storm then weakened over the next few days, making multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane. Donna generated severe wind gusts of up to over southern portions of the archipelago nation, and prolific rains affected the country and the nearby Turks and Caicos Islands. Several small island communities in the southern regions of The Bahamas were leveled, but no damage total or fatalities were reported.

As it neared the United States, Donna encountered weaker steering currents, turned northwestward, and re-intensified. Early on September 10, Donna made landfall on the Florida Keys with winds of , the most severe observed there since 1935. Donna then weakened as it paralleled the southwestern Florida peninsula, making landfall south of Naples with winds of . In the Florida Keys, coastal flooding severely damaged 75% of buildings, destroyed several subdivisions in Marathon. On the mainland, 5,200 houses were damaged, which does not include the 75% of homes damaged at Fort Myers Beach; 50% of buildings were also destroyed in the city of Everglades. Crop losses were also extensive. A total of 50% of the grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crop was lost, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. In the state of Florida alone, there were 13 deaths and $300 million in losses.

Donna weakened over Florida and was a Category 1 hurricane when it re-emerged into the Atlantic from North Florida. By early on September 12, the storm made landfall near Topsail Beach, North Carolina, as a Category 2 hurricane. Donna brought tornadoes and wind gusts up to , damaging or destroying several buildings in Eastern North Carolina, while crops were damaged as far as inland. Additionally, storm surge caused significant beach erosion and structural damage at Wilmington and Nags Head. Eight people were killed and there were over 100 injuries. Later on September 12, Donna reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to move northeastward. The storm struck Long Island, New York, late on September 12 and rapidly weakened inland. On the following day, Donna became extratropical over Maine.

==Meteorological history==

On August 29, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa near Dakar. That day, it is estimated a tropical depression developed along the wave southeast of Cape Verde. There was a lack of data for several days, but it is estimated that the system gradually intensified. On September 2, ships in the region suggested there was a tropical storm after reporting winds of over . That day, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system and observed a well-defined eye, along with winds of . Based on the data, the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, initiated advisories on Hurricane Donna at 22:00 UTC on September 2, about east of the Lesser Antilles. It is estimated that the storm attained hurricane status a day prior. The Azores High to the north was unusually powerful, which caused Donna to move to the west-northwest. When advisories began, Donna was intensifying into a major hurricane, which is the equivalent of a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; it would ultimately maintain this status for nearly eight days.

Continuing to the west-northwest, Donna strengthened further, attaining maximum sustained winds of at 00:00 UTC on September 4—an intensity it maintained for two more days. Operationally, winds were estimated to be . Late on September 4, the eye of Donna moved over Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and Anguilla, and passed just south of Anegada. Donna was then well-organized, described in the &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot; as akin to &quot;an intense, idealized hurricane.&quot; A weakening trough to the north turned the hurricane more northwesterly, bringing it within of the north coast of Puerto Rico. The storm then underwent further intensification to Category 4 status on September 6, and reached its first peak of by 00:00 UTC on September 7. At that time, Donna began turning more to the west as a ridge built to its north, and it soon weakened back to Category 3 status. Over the next few days, the intense hurricane moved slowly through the southern Bahamas without defined steering currents, and the eye passed near or over Mayaguana, Acklins, Fortune Island, and Ragged Island.

While passing through the Straits of Florida, Donna brushed the northern coast of Cuba on September 9 with gale-force winds. Subsequently, a cold front moved eastward through the United States and weakened the ridge, causing the hurricane to turn more to the northwest. It re-intensified over warm sea surface temperatures, and the hurricane&#x27;s minimum barometric pressure dropped to on September 10. Between 02:00 and 03:00 UTC that day, the eye of Donna crossed through the Florida Keys at Conch Key, just northeast of Marathon, with sustained winds of and gusts to . The hurricane continued to the northwest along the southwest coast of Florida, weakening due to interaction with the peninsula, before making landfall on Goodland, a short distance east of Marco Island, with winds of . Donna then traversed Naples and Fort Myers before turning inland to the northeast.

At 0800 UTC on September 11, Donna exited Daytona Beach into the western Atlantic with winds of about , still as an organized hurricane. Accelerating to the northeast due to an approaching trough, the hurricane re-intensified slightly before making landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, early on September 12 with winds of . At 0900 UTC that day, Donna again emerged over open waters near Virginia, although it had weakened, and the eye expanded to over in diameter. Late on September 12, the hurricane made landfall near Brookhaven, New York, as a low-end Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of . On September 13, Donna became extratropical over northern Maine before entering eastern Canada, having become associated with the approaching cold front. After moving across Quebec and Labrador, Donna reached the Labrador Sea and dissipated early on September 14.

==Preparations==
At noon on September 3, a hurricane watch was issued for the Leeward Islands, which at 6 p.m. was upgraded to a warning. Also at 6 p.m., hurricane watches were raised for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which at 6 a.m. on September 4, were upgraded to warnings. By 6 a.m. on September 5, hurricane warnings were dropped for the Leeward Islands, and at 9 a.m., southwest Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island&#x27;s hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings. By noon, all remaining hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico were changed to gale warnings. In Puerto Rico, flood warnings were issued on September 5, although some residents in the region did not heed the notice; many returned to their homes after the hurricane passed to the north. On Vieques Island, about 1,700 United States Marines evacuated to naval ships. Officials advised small boats to remain at port, and thousands of residents evacuated to schools set up as Red Cross shelters. Along the Cuban coast, about 3,000 people evacuated inland or to churches and schools; while in the Bahamas, stores closed and boats were sent to port.
Beginning on September 7, hurricane watches were put in place for the Florida coast from Key West to Melbourne. The next day, the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings from Key West to Key Largo, with hurricane watches raised on the west coast northward to Fort Myers, and gale warnings issued from Key Largo to Vero Beach. By September 11, hurricane warnings were in effect for southern Florida from Daytona Beach on the east coast to Cedar Key on the west coast, including Lake Okeechobee. Gale warnings were in place northward from Cedar Key to St. Marks, as well as from Daytona Beach northward to Savannah, Georgia. Evacuations in the Florida Keys disrupted traffic along the Overseas Highway. The Air Force evacuated 90 Boeing B-47 Stratojets from Homestead Air Reserve Base (At that time Homestead AFB). At Cape Canaveral, the threat of the storm caused the launching of two missiles to be postponed. Most flights out of Miami International Airport were canceled during the storm&#x27;s approach. Officials closed schools in Miami and the Florida Keys, and recommended residents in low-lying areas of the Florida Keys and southwestern Florida to evacuate. Ultimately, about 12,000 people in southern Florida sought refuge in storm shelters, two of which were damaged during the storm. In Miami-Dade County alone, there were 77 storm shelters housing 10,000 people.

At 5 p.m. on September 10, gale warnings were extended northward to Myrtle Beach. At 11 p.m., hurricane warnings were lowered in the Florida Keys but extended northward from Daytona Beach to Savannah, Georgia. At 11 a.m. on September 11, all warnings were lowered south of Vero Beach and along the Florida west coast, while hurricane warnings were extended northward from Savannah to Myrtle Beach. At 5 p.m., hurricane warnings were lowered south of Fernandina Beach, while they were extended northward to include the entire North Carolina coast. Gale warnings were issued northward to Cape May. At 9 p.m., hurricane warnings were extended northward to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued northward to Eastport, Maine. Ships at dock in Newport, Rhode Island were towed out into the bay to weather the storm. On September 12 at 5 a.m., hurricane warnings were extended northward to Eastport, and dropped south of Cape Hatteras. At 7 a.m., hurricane warnings were lowered south of Cape Charles. At 2 p.m., hurricane warnings were dropped south of Cape May. At 5 p.m., hurricane warnings were discontinued south of Manasquan, New Jersey. At 8 p.m., hurricane warnings expired south of Block Island. By 11 p.m. on September 12, all hurricane warnings had been lowered.

==Impact==

Hurricane Donna was a very destructive hurricane that caused extensive damage from the Lesser Antilles to New England. At least 364 people were killed by the hurricane and property damage was estimated at $900 million (1960 USD).

===West Africa===
The precursor to Hurricane Donna brought severe weather to the Dakar area of Senegal. Air France Flight 343, which was flying from Paris, France to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, attempted to land at the Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport as a layover. However, due to squally weather, the plane instead crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 63 people on board. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cape Verde on August 30.

===Caribbean===
Hurricane Donna caused very extensive damage on Saint-Martin, killed 7 and left at least a quarter of the island&#x27;s population homeless. A weather station in Sint Maarten reported sustained wind gusts of and a pressure reading in the main airport. 
Donna killed two people on Antigua. During the passing of Hurricane Donna, Anguilla recorded five deaths, including a woman who died when the roof of her house collapsed.

Despite passing only north of the island, Donna caused only minor damage on St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands. A station there reported a wind gust of . Some fences were toppled, while several houses were reported to have been damaged or destroyed. Electrical and telephone services were also disrupted. The highest daily rainfall total on the island was , causing minor local flooding. On Saint John, several small boats capsized.

While passing to the north of Puerto Rico, Donna produced winds of in San Juan. Along the north coast of the island, high tides of around and strong waves caused coastal flooding. The hurricane dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at at Naguabo in the central portion of the island. Large areas of eastern Puerto Rico received over of precipitation. The hurricane left about 2,500 people homeless on the island. Despite advanced warning of the floods, the hurricane killed 107 people on the island, of which 84 were in Humacao.

In Haiti, the southern periphery of the hurricane killed three people in Port au Prince. Later, Donna brushed the north coast of Cuba with strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing damage along much of the coast. In Gibara, the storm wrecked 80 houses.

===Turks and Caicos and Bahamas===
On Grand Turk in the Turks and Caicos, Donna produced winds of , as the strongest winds remained north of the island. However, the storm dropped heavy rainfall of over , much of which fell in a 12‑hour period. Despite the rains, damage there was minor.

In the Bahamas, the anemometer at Ragged Island blew away after registering a wind gust. At Mayaguana, where residents evacuated to a missile tracking base, hurricane-force winds raged for 13 hours. The winds largely destroyed the village of Abraham&#x27;s Bay on the island. Andros experienced hurricane-force winds for a few hours, and winds on Fortune Island were estimated at before the anemometer blew away. The strongest winds remained south of the northwestern Bahamas, which limited damage there. Donna cut communications between several islands.

Several small island communities in the southern Bahamas were leveled. North Caicos reported of rainfall in 24 hours.

===United States===
There were 50 people reported dead in the United States, with damages totaling to $3.35 billion. Donna crossed directly over United States Air Force radar station Texas Tower 4, causing severe damage to the structure and leading to its eventual loss in January 1961.

Donna was the only hurricane to affect every state along the East Coast with hurricane-force winds.

====Florida====

The U.S. state of Florida received the most damage from Hurricane Donna. Portions of southern and western Florida received over of rainfall from the hurricane, peaking at . Strong winds were observed in the state, with a sustained wind speed of in Tavernier and a gusts up to at Sombrero Key Light. In Miami, winds reached . Southeast of the city, high waves washed a freighter onshore an island. The highest observed storm surge of was reported at Marathon. The hurricane also lashed Southwest Florida, where tides were above normal.

In the Florida Keys, some areas experienced &quot;almost complete destruction&quot;. In Key West, one death was confirmed, and 71 people were injured. About 564 homes were demolished, and an additional 1,382 were damaged, 583 of them severely. Farther north, an estimated 75% of buildings were extensively damaged between Marathon and Tavernier. In the former, tides inundated the city and destroyed several subdivisions. Storm surge inundated parts of the Overseas Highway. Six bridges between Marathon and Craig Key had been nearly or entirely swept away. Many boats and docks were severely damaged or destroyed. Additionally, the pipeline supplying water to the Florida Keys was wrecked in three places.

In Miami-Dade County (then Dade County), thousands of low-lying homes in the Homestead area were flooded. The storm also overturned 25 mobile homes and caused one death in the city. While telephone service remained mostly uninterrupted, approximately 152,000 people lost electricity. Donna was the first hurricane to affect Miami, Florida, since Hurricane King in October 1950. Although structural damage in and around Miami was generally light, winds shattered windows and uprooted trees. Heavy precipitation inundated streets. Overall, 857 houses in Dade County were destroyed, while about 2,317 others suffered damage. Significant agricultural losses were also reported. About 100 homes in Broward County reported minor damage. In Boca Raton and Delray Beach, damage was mostly limited to downed billboard signs and shattered windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBP 9/11 Local&quot;&gt; 
*&quot;Little Damage From Donna In Local Area&quot;, p. 1 
*&quot;Little Damage&quot;, p. 6 &lt;/ref&gt; Boynton Beach observed wind gusts up to at the inlet. Storm surge covered State Road A1A with mud and sand. In North Palm Beach, winds shattered a few windows and destroyed a shopping center sign. A fire destroyed a cocktail lounge in Juno Beach after response teams were unable to extinguish the blaze due to high winds.

Large tracts of mangrove forest were lost in the western portion of Everglades National Park, while at least 35% of the white heron population in the park were killed. The lodge and marina at Flamingo, as well as a ranger&#x27;s way station near Cape Sable, were virtually destroyed. Tides from Fort Myers Beach southward ranged between above normal. In Everglades City, about 50% of buildings were destroyed due to strong winds and coastal flooding, and roofs were blown off or damaged. Floodwaters reached about in height inside the historic Collier County Courthouse, forcing refugees taking shelter in the building to evacuate to the second floor. The city briefly became inaccessible due to inundated roads. Thousands of trees were toppled, blocking portions of the Tamiami Trail. Approximately half of the homes in Chokoloskee were destroyed, while floodwaters entered a number of homes in Ochopee. The community of Immokalee reported about $3 million in damage. In Naples, storm surge entered many high-priced homes, while the fishing pier was wrecked. A total of 19 cottages and 12 mobile homes at Gordon Pass were damaged beyond repairs. Throughout Naples, Donna demolished 87 homes and damaged 614 others in Everglades City. &quot;The Miami News&quot; described Vanderbilt Beach as being reduced to &quot;another welter of splintered homes.&quot; Throughout Collier County, strong winds and coastal flooding combined destroyed 153 homes, severely damaged 409 others, and caused minor damage to 1,049 dwellings.

Donna left about $3 million in property damage and two deaths in Fort Myers. A new church in Bradenton was destroyed, while much of the city was left without power. In Winter Haven, 13 homes were destroyed, 100 others suffered major damage, and 2,400 dwellings experienced minor damage. One person was killed in the city. The turn into southern Florida lessened damage in the Tampa area. High winds deroofed an armory building in Dade City sheltering 150 people. In Volusia County, Donna destroyed 10 homes, severely damaged 112 homes, and caused minor damage to 1,100 others, while 25 buildings were demolished, 400 substantially damaged, and inflicted minor damage to 750 others. One fatality occurred in the county.

Throughout the state of Florida, the storm destroyed 2,156 homes and trailers, severely damaged 3,903, and inflicted minor impact on 30,524 others. Approximately 391 farm buildings were destroyed, an additional 989 suffered extensive impact, and 2,499 others received minor damage. Roughly 174 buildings were demolished, 1,029 received major impact, and 4,254 suffered minor damage. Additionally, 281 boats were destroyed or severely damaged. A total of 50% of grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crops were ruined, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. With at least $350 million in damage in Florida alone, Donna was the costliest hurricane to impact the state, at the time. Additionally, there were 14 confirmed fatalities: six from drowning, four from heart attacks, two from automobile accidents, and two from electrocution. About 1,188 others were injured.

====Southeastern United States and Mid-Atlantic====

The storm brought minor impact to Georgia. Wind gusts of along the coast felled trees and tree limbs, resulting in electrical and telephone-service outages. In Brunswick, GA, a power outage at the power plant caused a minor explosion. Heavy rainfall temporarily flooded some streets in the city. Further north in South Carolina, gale-force winds were reported along the coast, but caused little damage. An F3 tornado struck areas just north of Downtown Charleston, destroying several houses and severely damaging a number of others. There were 10 injuries, some of which were caused by flying glass. Damage from this tornado was over $500,000. An F1 tornado also touched down in Garden City Beach, destroying or extensively damaging six buildings. In Beaufort County, many trees were uprooted, power lines were downed, homes were unroofed, piers were destroyed, and there was significant damage to corn and soybean crops.

In North Carolina, Donna brought two tornadoes to the state. An F1 tornado damaged several small buildings in Bladen County. An F2 tornado in Sampson County destroyed a dwelling with eight occupants, all of whom were hospitalized. Along the coast, wind gusts as high as damaged or destroyed several buildings. Additionally crops were damaged as far as inland. Storm tides ranging from above normal caused significant beach erosion and structural damage at Wilmington and Nags Head. Additionally, Topsail Beach was reported to have been 50% destroyed. In Southport, the town docks were almost completely demolished. There were eight deaths, including three from drowning, two from falling trees, two from weather-related traffic accidents, and one from electrocution. At least 100 people were injured enough to require hospitalization. Damage in North Carolina exceeded $5 million, with the worst impact occurring in New Hanover County.

In Virginia, the east coast of the state reported hurricane-force winds, while gusts reached up to in Virginia Beach. Strong winds toppled trees and electrical wires, which blocked streets. Additionally, buildings suffered roof damage and broken windows; some structures were completely destroyed. Offshore, rough seas sank or destroyed numerous small crafts, while a vessel was driven aground. The storm killed three people in Virginia; two of the deaths occurred when a barge collided with a freighter and later sank, and another after a man attempted to safeguard his boat. Strong winds and heavy rains were observed in eastern Maryland. Ocean City suffered the worst impact, with over $300,000 in property damage. The storm also damaged crops in the area, especially corn and apples. Effects from the storm in Delaware were similar, with property damage and considerable losses to corn and apple crops. In Pennsylvania, wind gusts up to in the southeastern portions of the state toppled many trees and utility wires. Heavy rains and poor drainage in some areas flooded basements, lawns, and streets. Low-lying areas in Bucks and Montgomery counties were inundated with up to of water after many streams and creeks nearby overflowed. One death in the state was reported after a boy was swept into a swollen creek behind his home in Sharon Hill.

Winds as strong as were observed along the coast of New Jersey. Rainfall in the state was generally between , with a peak of near Hammonton. Damage from the storm was most severe in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth, and Ocean counties, where numerous boats, docks, boardwalks, and cottages were damaged or destroyed. A resort area in Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey saw its boardwalk and tourist attractions destroyed by the hurricane, and the area has never recovered. Losses to agriculture were significant, with damage to apple and peach trees &quot;considerable&quot;, the former of which lost about one-third of its crops. Wind damage to corn, Sudan grass, and sorghum resulted in a delay in their harvest. Nine deaths were reported in the state of New Jersey. In southeastern New York, the eye of Donna crossed 10 miles to the eastern tip of Long Island. Heavy rains, hurricane-force winds, and &quot;unprecedented&quot; high tides were observed. Severe small stream flooding caused significant damage, especially on Long Island, the waterfront of New York City, and further north in Greene County. The storm caused three fatalities in the state, two from drowning and another from a person crushed by a falling tree.

The eye of Hurricane Donna crossed near the Connecticut and Rhode Island state line, thus much of the damage in Connecticut was in far eastern sections. Strong winds left 15,000 people without telephone service, while 88,000 homes lost electricity. Along the coast, tides caused beach erosion, inundated streets, and weakened foundations. Four seaside cottages were destroyed. Crop damage was isolated and mainly limited to apples and corn. In Rhode Island, the storm brought a wind gust as strong as to Block Island. Telephone and electrical services were severely disrupted. Along the coast, high tides significantly damaged or destroyed about 200 homes at Narragansett Bay and Warwick cove. Damage to these vessels collectively totaled to over $2 million. Agriculture also suffered impact, particularly to fruit, timber, and poultry, especially in Newport and Portsmouth.

===Elsewhere in North America===

Strong winds were also observed in Massachusetts, with a wind gust of at the Blue Hill Observatory. Extensive losses to apple orchards occurred, as the fruit was blown out of trees. Widespread telephone and power outages were reported. The strong southwest winds associated with Donna, in combination with very little rainfall, led to a significant deposit of salt spray, which whitewashed southwest-facing windows. Many trees and shrubs saw their leaves brown due to the salt. However, in other areas, of precipitation fell, causing some washouts and local flooding. Waves along the coast ripped small boats and pleasure craft from their moorings and subsequently smashed them against rocks or seawalls.

In Vermont, winds damaged trees, tree branches, and power lines, causing telephone and electrical service outages in a few communities. Rainfall totals ranged , resulting in washouts in some areas. Damage to apple orchards totaled $50,000. Along the coast of New Hampshire, many boats were smashed or damaged in some way. Strong winds felled trees and power lines, causing residents in the southern portions of the state to lose telephone service and electricity. Additionally, apple orchards suffered $200,000 in damage. Rainfall in the state peaked at near Peterborough, resulting in local flooding and washouts.

Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20 boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat damage was estimated at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing a fire that resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a loss of telephone and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling trees or tree branches. Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.

After becoming extratropical, the remnants of Donna continued northeastward into New Brunswick, Quebec, and then Labrador. Wind gusts of in Quebec snapped electrical poles and trees. One death occurred when a man suffered a heart attack when his home was threatened by a fire. Additionally, weather-related traffic accidents in the province resulted in two injuries.

==Aftermath==
Following the storm, President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a disaster declaration for Florida and North Carolina, allowing residents of those states to be eligible for public assistance.

The United States military sent a plane carrying doctors and food from Patrick Air Force Base to Mayaguana in the Bahamas. Crews of doctors and workers with food and supplies left from Key West and Miami to traverse the Florida Keys, bringing aid to affected residents. In Marathon, a large reconstruction program rehabilitated the key by Christmas.

Coral reefs were damaged in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary by the hurricane. Donna caused a significant negative impact on aquatic life in north Florida Bay. Marine life was either stranded by retreating salt water which had been driven inland or killed by muddied waters in its wake. Oxygen depletion due to animals perishing in the hurricane caused additional mortality. Although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks, dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame. Marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion. Sports fishing in the area took a few months to recover. Juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine nursery grounds into deeper water about offshore, where they were subsequently captured by fishermen. A Caspian tern was swept up the North American coast well to the north of its traditional breeding grounds, to Nova Scotia, which was witnessed four hours after the storm went by Digby Neck.

==Retirement==

Because of storm&#x27;s devastating impact, the name &quot;Donna&quot; was retired by the U.S. Weather Bureau following the 1960 season, and will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. &quot;Donna&quot; was replaced with &quot;Dora&quot; for the 1964 season.

==Depictions in popular culture==
Nobel Prize-winner John Steinbeck wrote about Hurricane Donna in his 1962 non-fiction memoir &quot;Travels with Charley: In Search of America&quot;. Steinbeck had had a truck fitted with a custom camper-shell for a journey he intended to take across the United States, accompanied by his poodle Charley. He planned on leaving after Labor Day from his home in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York. Steinbeck delayed his trip slightly due to Donna, which made a direct hit on Long Island. Steinbeck wrote of saving his boat during the middle of the hurricane, during which he jumped into the water and was blown to shore clinging to a fallen branch driven by the high winds. It was an exploit which foreshadowed his fearless, or even reckless, state of mind to dive into the unknown.

The winds of Donna can be seen in the feature film &quot;Blast of Silence&quot; (1961); the final scenes on Long Island had been previously scheduled, and the filmmakers decided to go ahead and shoot the exterior scene despite the hurricane.

<text>Terrance William Dicks (14 April 1935 – 29 August 2019) was an English author and television screenwriter, script editor and producer. In television, he had a long association with the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, working as a writer and also serving as the programme&#x27;s script editor from 1968 to 1974. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; News Page described him as &quot;arguably the most prolific contributor to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot;. He later became a script editor and producer of classic serials for the BBC.

Dicks wrote many children&#x27;s books during the 1970s and 1980s. He also maintained his association with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; by adapting televised stories into novelisations for Target Books and in later years contributing to many documentaries and DVD commentaries for the series.

==Early career==
Born in East Ham, Essex (now part of Greater London), Dicks was the only son of William, a tailor&#x27;s salesman and Nellie (née Ambler), a waitress. His parents later ran a pub, the Fox and Hounds, in Forest Gate. He excelled in English at East Ham Grammar School and consumed literature ranging from classics to pulp thrillers and adventure stories. He won a scholarship to study English at Downing College, Cambridge, and later performed two years of national service in the British Army with the Royal Fusiliers. Following his discharge from the armed forces, he worked for five years as an advertising copywriter, and started to write radio play scripts for the BBC in his spare time.

His breakthrough into television came when friend Malcolm Hulke, whom he met when he rented a room from him, asked for his help with the scripting of &quot;The Mauritius Penny&quot;, an episode of the second series of ABC&#x27;s action-adventure &quot;The Avengers&quot;, for which Dicks was awarded a co-writer&#x27;s credit. Dicks went on to co-write a further two &quot;Avengers&quot; episodes with Hulke: the second, &quot;Intercrime&quot;, was later re-worked for the sixth and final series.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
In 1968, Dicks was hired as assistant script editor on the BBC science-fiction TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was appointed head script editor the following year and earned his first writing credit for the programme when he and Hulke co-wrote the 10-part serial &quot;The War Games&quot;, which concluded the series&#x27; sixth season and the Second Doctor&#x27;s (Patrick Troughton) tenure. The serial introduced the concept of the Time Lords and initiated the Doctor&#x27;s exile to Earth, which would be a major theme of the Third Doctor&#x27;s tenure. Dicks had been the uncredited co-writer of the earlier serial &quot;The Seeds of Death&quot; (1969), having extensively re-written Brian Hayles&#x27; original scripts.

Dicks formed a highly productive working relationship with incoming &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts, serving as script editor on all of Letts&#x27;s five seasons as series producer from 1970 to 1974. During his tenure as script editor on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Dicks oversaw a number of additions to the series&#x27; mythology that still exist in the modern era, including the following:

* The development of the Time Lords and their society
* The name Gallifrey (augmented from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; writer Robert Holmes&#x27; &quot;Galfrey&quot;)
* The creation of companions Liz Shaw, Jo Grant, and Sarah Jane Smith
* The term &quot;regeneration&quot; &quot;(Planet of the Spiders)&quot;
* An established race of villainous monsters turn to the side of good (the Ice Warriors in &quot;The Curse of Peladon&quot; by Brian Hayles)
* Sontarans (from writer Robert Holmes)
* The Dematerialisation Circuit is vital for the operation of the TARDIS
* The concept that the TARDIS is indestructible
* The TARDIS can be remote controlled
* The TARDIS has a Telepathic Circuit (in &quot;The Time Monster)&quot;
* The TARDIS might be sentient (&quot;The Time Monster&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;)
* The Blinovitch Limitation Effect used as a plot device to explain away paradoxes &quot;(Day of the Daleks)&quot;
* Multi-Doctor stories &quot;(The Three Doctors)&quot;

During Dicks&#x27; tenure, the series also delved into social and political concepts. Sometimes these were straightforward and other times they were metaphors. Concepts and topics included the respect for all life (&quot;The Silurians)&quot;, Great Britain joining the European Economic Community (in metaphor in &quot;The Curse of Peladon&quot;), apartheid (&quot;The Mutants&quot;), global pollution (&quot;The Green Death&quot;) and equality for women (with the inclusion of Sarah Jane Smith as companion).

In 1972, Dicks embarked on a parallel career as an author with the publication of his first book, &quot;The Making of Doctor Who&quot; (a history of the production of the TV series), which was co-written by Hulke.

After stepping down as script editor, Dicks continued his association with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, writing four scripts for his successor, Robert Holmes: these were &quot;Robot&quot; (1975, Tom Baker&#x27;s first outing as the Fourth Doctor), &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; (1976, for which Dicks was credited under the pseudonym Robin Bland after his displeasure at Holmes&#x27; re-writes prompted him to request that it be shown &quot;under some bland pseudonym&quot;), &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot; (1977) and &quot;State of Decay&quot; (1980), a re-written version of a story originally titled &quot;The Vampire Mutations&quot;, which had been due for production during season 15. The BBC decided that the vampiric theme would clash with the plot of its new adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Count Dracula&quot;, which was due for transmission at roughly the same time, and replaced it with &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot;. His final &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script was &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), a feature-length episode for the programme&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

Dicks&#x27; other work for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; included two stage plays, &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday&quot; (1974) and &quot;Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure&quot; (1989), and an audio drama for Big Finish Productions titled &quot;Comeback&quot; (2002), which was the first to feature former Doctor&#x27;s companion Sarah Jane Smith in a significant capacity. He went on to contribute several additional scripts to Big Finish including audio adaptations of his two-stage plays, a Sixth Doctor-era story for the &quot;Companion Chronicle&quot; range, and a Bernice Summerfield story, in 2011, which was the final script of his career.

The first serial aired after Dicks&#x27; death, the 2020 Thirteenth Doctor-era story &quot;Spyfall&quot;, was dedicated to him.

===Books===
Dicks contributed heavily to Target Books&#x27; series of novelisations of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV serials, writing 67 of the titles published by the company. As Dicks explains in an interview in the documentary &quot;Built for War&quot; (included on the 2006 DVD release of &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;), he served as the unofficial editor of the Target Books range. In this role, he would attempt to enlist the author of the original scripts to write the novelisation whenever possible, but if they refused or had other commitments, Dicks would usually undertake the work himself (although he also recruited other writers, including former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Ian Marter and former series producer Philip Hinchcliffe).

On one occasion, he enlisted Robert Holmes to novelise his script for &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, but when Holmes gave up after writing only one chapter, it was left to Dicks to complete the work. Dicks had better success in recruiting the original writers for the later &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials, and was required to adapt only one Sixth Doctor story himself (&quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;; he again replaced Holmes, who had died in 1986). Dicks&#x27; name appears on the cover of no Seventh Doctor novelisations. His plans to publish a novelisation of his stage play &quot;Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure&quot; were not realised.

As of September, 1980, Terrance Dicks&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisations had sold three-and-a-half million copies and had been translated into ten different languages.

During the 1990s, Dicks contributed to Virgin Publishing&#x27;s line of full-length, officially licensed, original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels, &quot;New Adventures&quot;, which continued the series&#x27; storyline following the TV cancellation in 1989. Dicks wrote three &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels for Virgin, and continued to write occasionally for the franchise after BBC Books assumed the licence in 1997. He wrote the first of the &quot;Eighth Doctor Adventures&quot;, titled &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot;, which was, for a time, the best-selling original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel. &quot;World Game&quot;, featuring the Second Doctor, is set during &quot;Season 6B&quot;. Later contributions to the range were the &quot;Quick Reads&quot; books &quot;Made of Steel&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Judoon&quot;, both featuring the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones.

His final &quot;Doctor Who&quot; short story, &quot;Save Yourself&quot;, was published posthumously by BBC Books in October 2019.

A compilation of his work chosen by fans, &quot;The Essential Terrance Dicks&quot;, was published in two volumes in August 2021.

==Other television work==
Dicks also wrote for the ATV soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. He co-created and wrote for the short-lived BBC science-fiction TV series &quot;Moonbase 3&quot; (1973), and wrote for the ITC science-fiction series &quot;&quot; (1976). During the early 1980s, Dicks served once more as script editor to producer Barry Letts on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Classics&quot; strand of period dramas and literary adaptations.

When Letts returned to directing in 1985, Dicks succeeded him as the producer of the &quot;Sunday Classics&quot;, overseeing productions such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1985), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1986) and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1987), before retiring from the BBC in 1988 to resume his career as a novelist.

==Children&#x27;s fiction and non-fiction==
It was through his work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books that Dicks became a writer of children&#x27;s fiction, penning many successful titles during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1976, he wrote a trilogy for Target Books, &quot;The Mounties&quot;, concerning a Royal Canadian Mounted Police recruit. They were followed from 1979 to 1983 another trilogy, &quot;Star Quest&quot;, which was later re-printed by Big Finish Productions.

Beginning in 1978, Dicks penned &quot;The Baker Street Irregulars&quot; inspired by the Sherlock Holmes characters; the series eventually ran to 10 books, the last published in 1987. In 1981, he commenced work on a series of six children&#x27;s horror novels with &quot;Cry Vampire&quot;. In 1987, Dicks started a new series for very young children titled &quot;T. R. Bear&quot;, resulting in a further seven books. There followed the &quot;Sally Ann&quot; series, about a ragdoll, &quot;Magnificent Max&quot;, about a cat, and &quot;The Adventures of Goliath&quot; (Dicks&#x27; longest series, at 18 books), about a golden retriever. Another five books concerning a St. Bernard dog make up the &quot;Harvey&quot; series.

&quot;Jonathan&#x27;s Ghost&quot; and its three sequels were published in 1988, and the three-part &quot;MacMagic&quot; series followed in 1990. &quot;The Littlest Dinosaur&quot; was published in 1993 and &quot;The Littlest on Guard&quot; in 1994. Other works that Dicks published in 1994 include &quot;Woof! The Never Ending Tale&quot;, the &quot;Cold Blood&quot; series and the &quot;Chronicles of a Computer Game Addict&quot; series (both in four parts). Between 1998 and 2000, Dicks penned &quot;Changing Universe&quot; trilogy. In 2000 and 2001, Dicks produced the 12-book series, &quot;The Unexplained&quot;.

As well as his numerous fictional works, Dicks also penned several non-fiction books for children, including &quot;Europe United&quot;, &quot;A Riot of Writers&quot;, &quot;Uproar in the House&quot;, &quot;A Right Royal History&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ghastly&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Dicks lived in Hampstead, London. In 1963, he married Elsa Germaney, a teacher and later a Quaker recording clerk. They had three sons: Stephen, Jonathan and Oliver. They also had three grandchildren: Amy, Nelly Rose, and Rufus.

Dicks died in London on 29 August 2019 after a short illness.

<text>The recognition heuristic, originally termed the recognition principle, has been used as a model in the psychology of judgment and decision making and as a heuristic in artificial intelligence. The goal is to make inferences about a criterion that is not directly accessible to the decision maker, based on recognition retrieved from memory. This is possible if recognition of alternatives has relevance to the criterion. For two alternatives, the heuristic is defined as: 

The recognition heuristic is part of the &quot;adaptive toolbox&quot; of &quot;fast and frugal&quot; heuristics proposed by Gigerenzer and Goldstein. It is one of the most frugal of these, meaning it is simple or economical. In their original experiment, Daniel Goldstein and Gerd Gigerenzer quizzed students in Germany and the United States on the populations of both German and American cities. Participants received pairs of city names and had to indicate which city has more inhabitants. In this and similar experiments, the recognition heuristic typically describes about 80–90% of participants&#x27; choices, in cases where they recognize one but not the other object (see criticism of this measure below). Surprisingly, American students scored higher on German cities, while German participants scored higher on American cities, despite only recognizing a fraction of the foreign cities. This has been labeled the &quot;less-is-more effect&quot; and mathematically formalized.

== Domain specificity ==

The recognition heuristic is posited as a domain-specific strategy for inference. It is ecologically rational to rely on the recognition heuristic in domains where there is a correlation between the criterion and recognition. The higher the recognition validity α for a given criterion, the more ecologically rational it is to rely on this heuristic and the more likely people will rely on it. For each individual, α can be computed by

:α = C/(C+W)
where C is the number of correct inferences the recognition heuristic would make, computed across all pairs in which one alternative is recognized and the other is not, and W is the number of wrong inferences. Domains in which the recognition heuristic was successfully applied include the prediction of geographical properties (such as the size of cities, mountains, etc.), of sports events (such as Wimbledon and soccer championships) and elections. Research also shows that the recognition heuristic is relevant to marketing science. Recognition based heuristics help consumers choose which brands to buy in frequently purchased categories. A number of studies addressed the question of whether people rely on the recognition heuristic in an ecologically rational way. For instance, name recognition of Swiss cities is a valid predictor of their population (α = 0.86) but not their distance from the center of Switzerland (α = 0.51). Pohl reported that 89% of inferences accorded with the model in judgments of population, compared to only 54% in judgments of the distance. More generally, there is a positive correlation of r = 0.64 between the recognition validity and the proportion of judgments consistent with the recognition heuristic across 11 studies. Another study by Pachur suggested that the recognition heuristic is more likely a tool for exploring natural rather than induced recognition (i.e. not provoked in a laboratory setting) when inferences have to be made from memory. In one of his experiments, the results showed that there was a difference between participants in an experimental setting vs. a non-experimental setting.

== Less-is-more effect ==

If α &gt; β, and α, β are independent of n, then a less-is-more effect will be observed. Here, β is the knowledge validity, measured as C/(C+W) for all pairs in which both alternatives are recognized, and n is the number of alternatives an individual recognizes. A less-is-more effect means that the function between accuracy and n is inversely U-shaped rather than monotonically increasing. Some studies reported less-is-more effects empirically among two, three, or four alternatives and in group decisions), whereas others failed to do so, possibly because the effect is predicted to be small (see Katsikopoulos).

Smithson explored the &quot;less-is-more effect&quot; (LIME) with the recognition heuristic and challenges some of the original assumptions. The LIME occurs when a &quot;recognition-dependent agent has a greater probability of choosing the better item than a more knowledgeable agent who recognizes more items.&quot; A mathematical model is used in describing the LIME and Smithson’s study used it and attempted to modify it. The study was meant to mathematically provide an understanding of when the LIME occurs and explain the implications of the results. The main implication is &quot;that the advantage of the recognition cue depends not only on the cue validities, but also on the order in which items are learned&quot;.

== Neuropsychological evidence ==
The recognition heuristic can also be depicted using neuroimaging techniques. A number of studies have shown that people do not automatically use the recognition heuristic when it can be applied, but evaluate its ecological validity. It is less clear, however, how this evaluation process can be modeled. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study tested whether the two processes, recognition and evaluation, can be separated on a neural basis. Participants were given two tasks; the first involved only a recognition judgment (&quot;Have you ever heard of Modena? Milan?&quot;), while the second involved an inference in which participants could rely on the recognition heuristic (&quot;Which city has the larger population: Milan or Modena?&quot;). For mere recognition judgments, activation in the precuneus, an area that is known from independent studies to respond to recognition confidence, was reported. In the inference task, precuneus activation was also observed, as predicted, and activation was detected in the anterior frontomedian cortex (aFMC), which has been linked in earlier studies to evaluative judgments and self-referential processing. The aFMC activation could represent the neural basis of this evaluation of ecological rationality.

Some researchers have used event-related potentials (ERP) to test psychological mechanisms behind the recognition heuristic. Rosburg, Mecklinger, and Frings used a standard procedure with a city-size comparison task, similar to that used by Goldstein and Gigerenzer. They used ERP and analyzed familiarity-based recognition occurring 300-450 milliseconds after stimulus onset in order to predict the participants’ decisions. Familiarity-based recognition processes are relatively automatic and fast so these results provide evidence that simple heuristics like the recognition heuristic utilize basic cognitive processes.

== Controversies ==
Research on the recognition heuristic has sparked a number of controversies.

=== Trade-offs ===

The recognition heuristic is a model that relies on recognition only. This leads to the testable prediction that people who rely on it will ignore strong, contradicting cues (i.e., do not make trade-offs; so-called noncompensatory inferences). In an experiment by Daniel M. Oppenheimer participants were presented with pairs of cities, which included actual cities and fictional cities. Although the recognition heuristic predicts that participants would judge the actual (recognizable) cities to be larger, participants judged the fictional (unrecognizable) cities to be larger, showing that more than recognition can play a role in such inferences.

Newell &amp; Fernandez performed two experiments to try to test the claims that the recognition heuristic is distinguished from availability and fluency through binary treatment of information and inconsequentiality of further knowledge. The results of their experiments did not support these claims. Newell &amp; Fernandez and Richter &amp; Späth tested the non-compensatory prediction of the recognition heuristic and stated that &quot;recognition information is not used in an all-or-none fashion but is integrated with other types of knowledge in judgment and decision making.&quot;

A reanalysis of these studies at an individual level, however, showed that typically about half of the participants consistently followed the recognition heuristic in every single trial, even in the presence of up to three contradicting cues. Furthermore, in response to those criticisms, Marewski et al. pointed out that none of the studies above formulated and tested a compensatory strategy against the recognition heuristic, leaving the strategies that participants relied on unknown. They tested five compensatory models and found that none could predict judgments better than the simple model of the recognition heuristic.

=== Measurement ===
One major criticism of studies on the recognition heuristic that was raised was that mere accordance with the recognition heuristic is not a good measure of its use. As an alternative, Hilbig et al. proposed to test the recognition heuristic more precisely devised a multinomial processing tree model for the recognition heuristic. A multinomial processing tree model is a simple statistical model often used in cognitive psychology for categorical data. Hilbig et al. claimed that a new model of recognition heuristic use was needed due to the confound between recognition and further knowledge. The multinomial processing tree model was shown to be effective and Hilbig et al. claimed that it provided an unbiased measure of the recognition heuristic.

Pachur stated that it is an imperfect model but currently it is still the best model to predict people’s recognition-based inferences. He believes that precise tests have a limited value basically because certain aspects of the recognition heuristic are often ignored and so the results could be inconsequential or misleading.

=== Intuitive strategy ===

Hilbig et al. state that heuristics are meant to reduce effort and that the recognition heuristic reduces effort in making judgments by relying on one single cue and ignoring other information. In their study, they found that the recognition heuristic is more useful in deliberate thought than in intuitive thought. This means it is more useful when thoughts are intentional and not impulsive as opposed to intuitive thought, which is based more on impulse rather than conscious reasoning. 
In contrast, a study by Pachur and Hertwig found that it is actually the faster responses that are more in line with the recognition heuristic. Also, judgments accorded more strongly with the recognition heuristic under time pressure. In line with these findings, neural evidence suggests that the recognition heuristic may be relied upon by default.

== Support ==

Goldstein and Gigerenzer state that due to its simplicity, the recognition heuristic shows to what degree and in what situations behavior can be predicted. Some researchers suggest that the idea of the recognition heuristic should be retired but Pachur believes that a different approach should be taken in testing it. There are some researchers who believe that the recognition heuristic should be investigated using precise tests of the exclusive use of recognition.

Another study by Pachur suggested that the recognition heuristic is more likely a tool for exploring natural rather than induced recognition (i.e. not provoked in a laboratory setting) when inferences have to be made from memory. In one of his experiments, the results showed that there was a difference between participants in an experimental setting vs. a non-experimental setting.

== Synopsis ==

Using an adversarial collaboration approach, three special issues of the open access journal &quot;Judgment and Decision Making&quot; have been devoted to unravel the support for and problems with the recognition heuristic, providing the most recent and comprehensive synopsis of the epistemic status quo. In their Editorial to Issue III, the three guest editors strive for a cumulative theory integration.

<text>The Médoc (; ) is a region of France, well known as a wine growing region, located in the &quot;département&quot; of Gironde, on the left bank of the Gironde estuary, northwest of Bordeaux. Its name comes from &quot;(Pagus) Medullicus&quot;, or &quot;country of the &quot;Medulli&quot;&quot;, the local Celtic tribe. The region owes its economic success mainly to the production of red wine; it is home to around 1,500 vineyards.

The area also has pine forests and long sandy beaches. The Médoc&#x27;s geography is not ideal for wine grape growing, with its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean resulting in a comparatively mild climate and high rainfall making grape rot a constant problem. It is generally believed that the nature of the region&#x27;s wine derives from the soil; although the terrain is flat, excellent drainage is present and the increased amount of gravel in the soil allows heat to be retained, encouraging ripening, and extensive root systems.

==Viticulture==

With the exception of Château Haut-Brion from Graves, all of the red wines in the 1855 Classification are from the Médoc. Many of the Médoc wines that are not in this classification were classified using the Cru Bourgeois system until 2007. Following legal challenges this category was abolished, and reintroduced in 2010 as an annual &quot;mark of quality&quot; depending on independent annual assessment.

<doc id="902961" wikidata="Q3474018" url="?curid=902961" title="Otis, Oregon">
<text>Otis is an unincorporated community in Lincoln County, Oregon, United States, a half mile north of Otis Junction on Oregon Route 18. It is near the Salmon River.

Otis post office was established in 1900 and was named after Otis Thompson, nephew of Archibald S. Thompson, the postmaster.

U.S. Route 101 used to pass through Otis until a curvy and hilly section of road was rerouted in the 1960s. Otis Junction is at the intersection of the former terminus of Oregon Route 18 and the former alignment of U.S. 101.

The Sitka Center for Art and Ecology has an Otis mailing address but is located nearer to the coast on Cascade Head. The Otis ZIP code, 97368, also covers the community of Rose Lodge. Today Otis and Otis Junction are considered synonymous.

Otis made the national headlines in 1999 and again in 2004, when it was announced that the town was for sale for $3 million. The news stories describe the Otis Café and other amenities that are at Otis Junction; it is unclear if the that were for sale included the land in Otis proper. Owner Vivian Lematta&#x27;s grandfather bought the land from descendants of the Siletz Indians for $800 in 1910. Lematta left Otis in 1957. Included in the sale were the gas station and mini grocery store, a Pronto Pup corn dog stand, two houses, an empty 25-stall horse barn, a helicopter storage shed, a garage, a Grange hall, the Otis post office, the Otis Café, an auto-repair garage and of farmland. Part of the land was used for raising cattle and part was undergoing timber conservation.

==Climate==
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Otis has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="902962" wikidata="Q441047" url="?curid=902962" title="Dustin Brown (ice hockey)">
<text>Dustin James Brown (born November 4, 1984) is an American former professional ice hockey right winger. Brown spent his entire NHL career with the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL), who drafted him 13th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He is the Kings all-time games leader and served as team captain from 2008 to 2016; during this time he led the Kings to the 2012 and 2014 Stanley Cup championships, becoming the first Kings captain and second American captain (behind Derian Hatcher) to win the Stanley Cup. During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, he played for ZSC Lions in the Swiss National League A.

Brown was noted for his physical playing style, consistently ranking among NHL leaders in hits and penalties drawn, and his reserved, lead-by-example approach to his captaincy of the Kings.

Internationally, Brown has represented the United States at three World Championships, winning a bronze medal in 2004, and two World Junior Championships. He won a silver medal as an alternate captain of the United States national team at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Brown received the 2011 NHL Foundation Player Award for his extensive charity work in the Los Angeles community, and the Mark Messier Leadership Award in 2014.

==Playing career==
===Junior career===
After playing hockey at Ithaca High School for two years, Brown left his hometown to play junior hockey at age 16. He was drafted in the second round, 26th overall, by the Guelph Storm in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection Draft. Brown played three seasons for Guelph, scoring 194 points in 174 games. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the first round, 13 overall, in 2003.

===Los Angeles Kings (2003–2022)===
====2003–2008: Early seasons====
Brown signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Kings and made the Kings&#x27; 2003–04 team out of training camp. His first NHL game was October 9, 2003, against the Detroit Red Wings. Brown saw fourth-line ice time in his rookie year, and he scored his first NHL goal on November 22, 2003, in a 2–0 win over the Colorado Avalanche. He managed just 1 goal and 5 points in 31 games before his season was cut short by a high ankle sprain. Nonetheless, Brown&#x27;s physicality made a favorable impression with the Kings&#x27; coaching staff.

The following season was cancelled due to the NHL lockout. Brown was assigned to the Manchester Monarchs, the Kings&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, in order to develop his offensive game. He performed well in Manchester, averaging nearly a point per game and readying himself for an expanded NHL role.

With the lockout over, and NHL play resuming in 2005–06, Brown cemented his place on the team. As a 21-year-old checking forward, he managed 28 points in 79 games. More impressively, he led the team (and ranked 13th in the NHL) with 175 hits, and he drew the second most penalties in the NHL despite his limited ice time. A restricted free agent at the end of the year, Brown signed a two-year contract before the start of the 2006–07 season.

Brown&#x27;s third season saw an expansion in his role, as he was placed on the top line with star rookie center Anže Kopitar. The two young forwards became frequent linemates, as Brown&#x27;s hitting abilities and willingness to shoot complemented Kopitar&#x27;s dynamic passing and puck possession skills. Receiving the third-most ice time among Kings forwards, Brown responded with career-highs of 17 goals and 46 points in 81 games. Brown also received the most short-handed ice time among Kings forwards, a sign of his growing defensive reliability. He finished second in the NHL in hits, the first of six consecutive years that he ranked top three in the NHL in that category.
On October 26, 2007, shortly after the start of the 2007–08 season, the Kings and Brown agreed to a six-year, $19.05 million contract extension that ran through the 2013–14 season. The contract was signed a full year before Brown hit restricted free agency, partially because young forwards Dustin Penner of the Anaheim Ducks and Thomas Vanek of the Buffalo Sabres had just received lucrative offer sheets in restricted free agency, and the Kings did not want Brown to receive one. Brown produced his best offensive season that year. Continuing to play top-line minutes with Kopitar, he recorded 33 goals and 60 points. To date, that season remains the only year Brown has managed to reach the 30-goal plateau. Despite his personal success, the rebuilding Kings missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the fifth-straight year.

====2008–2016: Stanley Cup championships and captaincy====
The Kings named Brown the 13th captain in team history on October 8, 2008, just after the start of the 2008–09 season. Brown&#x27;s appointment filled the vacancy created when prior captain Rob Blake left the Kings in free agency to sign with the San Jose Sharks on July 3, 2008. Just 23 years old when he assumed the captaincy, Brown became the youngest captain and the only American captain in Kings history. Head coach Terry Murray pointed to Brown&#x27;s work ethic and commitment to the Kings to explain the decision, saying Brown &quot;shows that he cares tremendously about this team, about winning every night. I just want him to follow through with that, and he will because that&#x27;s his personality. Just keep blazing that trail, and players on the team will follow&quot;. Kings management was impressed by Brown&#x27;s emergence as a vocal leader in the locker room, especially after the departure of veteran presences Mattias Norström and Rob Blake. On the ice, Brown&#x27;s numbers dipped slightly from 2007–08, in part because of an 8.2% shooting percentage, his lowest since his rookie season. However, his 292 shots led the team, and his 24 goals were third. Brown was chosen to represent the Western Conference at the 2009 All-Star Game. The Kings missed the playoffs for a franchise-worst sixth straight year.
Brown again posted solid numbers in 2009–10, playing all 82 games for the first time and registering 24 goals and a career-high 32 assists. He scored his 100th NHL goal on January 14, 2010, against the Anaheim Ducks. With Brown leading a rapidly improving young core that included center Anze Kopitar, defenseman Drew Doughty and goaltender Jonathan Quick, the Kings finally snapped the eight-year playoff drought after clinching the sixth seed in the West to qualify for a playoff spot. Brown had one goal and four assists in six games as the Kings lost in the first round of the 2010 playoffs to the third seeded Vancouver Canucks.

Brown and the Kings entered the 2010–11 season with higher expectations. Brown again played all 82 games and scored 28 goals and 29 assists for 57 points. Anže Kopitar&#x27;s late season ankle injury forced the Kings to settle for a seventh-seeded finish in the Western Conference and a matchup with the second-seeded San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2011 playoffs. The Kings lost in six games for the second straight year, with Brown recording two points (a goal and an assist) in the series.

Brown began the 2011–12 season on a line with newly acquired center Mike Richards, but was shuffled throughout the lineup for most of the season. He maintained his consistent production, topping 20 goals and 50 points for the fifth-straight year. However, along with the rest of the Kings, he struggled to score in the first half of the season. Head coach Terry Murray was fired midway through the season, and as the Kings fell further out of the playoff picture, they were rumored to be listening to trade offers for Brown. New head coach Darryl Sutter called the Brown-Kopitar tandem &quot;stale&quot; and said Brown was not playing the &quot;straight-line, up-and-down, go-to-the-net, shoot-the-puck, run-over-people&quot; style Brown needed to be effective. Brown&#x27;s scoring pace picked up amidst the trade rumors, and he scored three goals on Corey Crawford and an assist on a Willie Mitchell goal in the last game before the NHL trade deadline, a 4–0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on February 25, 2012. The Kings retained Brown, who responded with 11 points in the nine games following the trade deadline. Brown later said he was playing with &quot;a chip on his shoulder&quot; and &quot;whether those rumors are true or not, they&#x27;re still out there, it gives you maybe a bit more motivation&quot;. With Brown producing and the trade-deadline acquisition of Jeff Carter, the Kings were one of the highest-scoring NHL teams down the stretch and made the playoffs as an eighth seed. After moving up-and-down the lineup for most of the season, Brown found stability playing on the first line with Anže Kopitar and Justin Williams. That line would remain intact throughout the entire 2012 playoffs. Brown recorded four goals and one assist for five points in the first round against the back-to-back Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Vancouver Canucks, including two shorthanded goals on Canucks&#x27; goaltender Roberto Luongo in a 4–2 Game 2 win. Brown is the first and only player as of 2022 with two shorthanded goals in a playoff game. In Game 3, he delivered a devastating open-ice check to Canucks center and captain Henrik Sedin directly in front of the Vancouver&#x27; bench. The hit left Sedin uninjured but dazed on the ice for several seconds until fellow Canuck&#x27; center Manny Malhotra, who was on the bench with his linemates at the time of the play, had to guide Henrik off the ice and on to the bench. Brown later scored the game-winning goal in the third period. Many observers, including TSN&#x27;s Bob McKenzie and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27; Michael Farber, called the hit the decisive moment in the series. The Kings upset the heavily favored top-seeded Canucks in five games, and then recorded the first sweep in franchise history over the second seeded St. Louis Blues in the second round. Brown registered two goals and four assists in the series. Both of his goals came in the decisive Game 4, a 3–1 Kings victory. The Kings then beat the third seeded Arizona Coyotes in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Brown scored the game-winning goal in Game 1 of that series and did not score again until Game 6 of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals against the sixth seeded New Jersey Devils, although he did manage five assists in that span. After being benched for the final minutes of a Game 5 loss, Brown produced three points in Game 6 to secure the Kings&#x27; first-ever Stanley Cup. He scored the first of three goals on a five-minute power play, and shortly afterwards, fired a shot that Jeff Carter deflected into the net for the eventual Cup-winning goal. Later, he assisted on another Carter goal. The Kings defeated the Devils 6–1, making Brown the second American-born captain to lead a team to a Stanley Cup championship and the Kings the second California-based team to win the Stanley Cup. With eight goals and 12 assists for 20 points in 20 games, Brown tied teammate Anže Kopitar for the lead in overall playoff point total.

On July 28, 2012, Brown had his &quot;Day with the Cup&quot;. Each year after a team has won the Stanley Cup, players, front office and hockey operation staff each get a day with the Stanley Cup. Brown hinted on the &quot;Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; he would bring the Cup back home. He did just that, bringing it to Ithaca High School in late July. During the lockout-shortened season, Brown finished shortened regular season with 18 goals and 11 assists for 29 points in 46 games. The Kings reached the Western Conference Finals for a second-straight year, but fell in five games to the Presidents’ Trophy-winning and eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks.

On July 18, 2013, the Kings signed Brown to an eight-year, $47 million contract extension. In the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, Brown led the Kings to another Stanley Cup title, despite facing some criticism for more muted contributions on the team&#x27;s run to the title. In the Finals against the New York Rangers, Brown scored the overtime winner in Game 2 to give the Kings a 5–4 victory and a 2–0 series lead, and he scored again during the Kings&#x27; 2–1 loss in Game 4. At the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, Brown was awarded the Mark Messier Leadership Award &quot;in recognition of his commitment and service to charities in his community&quot;.

On November 26, 2014, Brown recorded his 200th NHL goal in a 4–0 Kings win over the Minnesota Wild.

After the Kings missed the playoffs entirely for the first time since 2009 in 2015, Brown and the Kings returned to the playoffs in 2016 only to fall in the first round in five games to the San Jose Sharks.

====2016–2022: Later years====
Following back-to-back seasons of scoring less than 30 points, Brown was replaced as the Kings captain by Anže Kopitar on June 16, 2016. Speaking on the decision to have his captaincy stripped, Brown stated, &quot;I understand the decision and I respect the decision. Part of my problem was how it was handled. It just put me in an awkward spot.&quot;

The 2017–18 season marked a resurgence for Brown. After earning 36 points the season prior, Brown managed 28 goals and 33 assists for a career-high 61 points in 81 contests played. On December 21, 2017, Brown played in his 1,000th career NHL game. The Kings defeated the Colorado Avalanche 2–1 in overtime, where Brown scored the game-winning goal. On April 5, 2018, Brown scored four goals, including the overtime winner, against the Minnesota Wild.

In the pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season opener in a 4–3 OT loss against the Minnesota Wild on January 13, 2021, Brown recorded his 300th NHL goal.

Brown was eventually re-promoted to alternate captain since his demotion, and announced on April 28, 2022 before the 2021–22 season finale against the Vancouver Canucks that he would retire after the completion of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs, for which his Kings team qualified for the first time since 2018. At the time of the announcement, Brown had 28 points (9 goals, 19 assists) in 64 games in the 2021–22 regular season. In the season finale against the Canucks, he was named team captain for the Kings. In the 2022 playoffs, Brown&#x27;s Kings would be eliminated in seven games in the first round by the Edmonton Oilers, with Brown skating in all seven appearances and recording two points, his final game was on May 14.

Brown was honored with a statue on February 11, 2023, joining Wayne Gretzky and Luc Robitaille as the only Kings players with statues. The Kings also retired his #23 jersey that night, making him the sixth King so honored.

==International play==



Brown has played for the United States in multiple international tournaments. During the World Championship tournament of 2008, Brown received negative attention for a controversial hit that made contact with the head of Finnish player Jussi Jokinen as the final horn sounded.

Brown was named an alternate captain of the United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics and again in 2014.

==Style of play==
Brown was known for his physical, north–south style of game. Brown considered himself a clean hitter: after a controversial hit on Phoenix Coyotes defenseman Michal Rozsíval in the 2012 Western Conference Finals, Brown defended himself by saying, &quot;I take pride in playing the game clean and hard. There are going to be hits that are unfortunate but still clean.&quot; Brown had never been issued a fine or suspension from the NHL Department of Player Safety until April 24, 2013, when he received two-game suspension for an illegal elbow to the head of Minnesota Wild forward Jason Pominville on April 23, 2013. Brown&#x27;s former teammate Rob Blake said Brown &quot;comes at guys straight on, face-to-face. He goes right through guys.&quot; Despite his aggressive style, Brown did not miss a game due to injury over a span of four seasons. Brown was one of the most effective NHL players at drawing penalties, having led the NHL in that category in five of seven post-lockout seasons. Brown&#x27;s unparalleled success in that area led several commentators, including ex-NHL referee Kerry Fraser, to say that Brown acquired a reputation for embellishing infractions in order to draw penalties. Beyond his physicality and agitation, Brown provided a consistent offensive threat for the Kings, scoring at least 22 goals for five consecutive years. Brown played an effective two-way game and matured into an elite defensive and penalty-killing forward.

==Personal life==
Brown has 3 sons Jake, Mason, Cooper and one daughter MacKenzie, with his wife Nicole and lives in Buffalo, New York. Brown had a speech impediment early in his career, which he received therapy for before his professional career. He was heavily involved in charity work in the Greater Los Angeles Area during his playing years and was awarded the 2011 NHL Foundation Player Award for his community efforts and involvement.

<doc id="902969" wikidata="Q4376583" url="?curid=902969" title="Permissible exposure limit">
<text>The permissible exposure limit (PEL or OSHA PEL) is a legal limit in the United States for exposure of an employee to a chemical substance or physical agent such as high level noise. Permissible exposure limits were established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Most of OSHA&#x27;s PELs were issued shortly after adoption of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act in 1970.

Chemical regulation is sometimes expressed in parts per million (ppm), but often in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). Units of measure for physical agents such as noise are specific to the agent.

A PEL is usually given as a time-weighted average (TWA), although some are short-term exposure limits (STEL) or ceiling limits. A TWA is the average exposure over a specified period, usually a nominal eight hours. This means that for limited periods a worker may be exposed to concentration excursions higher than the PEL, as long as the TWA is not exceeded and any applicable excursion limit is not exceeded. An excursion limit typically means that &quot;...worker exposure levels may exceed 3 times the PEL-TWA for no more than a total of 30 minutes during a workday, and under no circumstances should they exceed 5 times the PEL-TWA, provided that
the PEL-TWA is not exceeded.&quot; Excursion limits are enforced in some states (for example Oregon) and on the federal level for certain contaminants such as asbestos.

A short-term exposure limit is one that addresses the average exposure over a 15-30 minute period of maximum exposure during a single work shift. A ceiling limit is one that may not be exceeded for any time, and is applied to irritants and other materials that have immediate effects.

==Regulatory agencies for occupational noise exposure==
===OSHA===
The current PEL for OSHA standards are based on a 5 decibel exchange rate. OSHA&#x27;s PEL for noise exposure is 90 decibels (dBA) for an 8-hour TWA. Levels of 90-140 dBA are included in the noise dose. PEL can also be expressed as 100 percent “dose” for noise exposure. When the noise exposure increases by 5 dB, the exposure time is cut in half. According to OSHA, a 95dBA TWA would be a 200 percent dose. PEL is exceeded when TWA &gt; 90 dBA. OSHA requires feasible engineering OR administrative controls, and mandatory hearing protection when the PEL is exceeded.

===MSHA===
Like OSHA, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) also uses the same 5 decibel exchange rate and 90 dBA for an 8-hour TWA for their PEL. Once a miner&#x27;s noise exposure exceeds the PEL, feasible engineering AND administrative controls must be in place to try to limit the noise exposure of the employees. If a mine operator uses administrative controls, procedures for such controls must be posted on the bulletin board and a copy must be supplied to all affected employees.

===NIOSH===
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) for noise exposure uses a 3 decibel exchange rate. The recommendation for occupational noise exposure is 85 decibels (dBA) for an 8-hour TWA. For every 3 dB over 85, the exposure time is cut in half. NIOSH reports exposures above this level are considered hazardous. NIOSH uses a hierarchy of control to reduce or remove hazardous noise.

== Chemical regulation for permissible exposure limits ==
Permissible Exposure Limits are regulatory limits for chemical hazards in a workplace set by OSHA. Organizations may implement stricter guidelines for chemical use and exposure, but OSHA guidelines must be followed at the minimum. Permissible Exposure Limits are time-weighted average, meaning that a worker may be exposed to higher concentrations of the chemical at different times of the work shift.

Many factors contribute in establishing Permissible Exposure Limits. Threshold Limit Values (TLVs), often determined by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGHI), is a key component in determining the PEL. Other things that contribute to determining the PEL are toxicity and particle size.

PELs for chemicals are measured in mg/M3 (milligrams per cubic meter). Mg/M3 is used to measure pollutant’s mass in the air. PELs compliance is monitored through direct reading measurement tools, various sampling methods, and measuring biological markers in workers.  Sampling for biological markers may include sampling urine and blood. Direct measurement tools, such as Q-Trak, and indirect measurement tools such as gas chromatography can be used for air sampling.

== Noise Exposure ==
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States established the allowed exposure limit for occupational noise at 90 dB and is based on an 8-hour time-weighted average for an 8-hour workday. For worker&#x27;s safety, OSHA mandates hearing conservation programs when noise levels are higher than 85 decibels. This is dependent on the sector, profession, or nation, different restrictions may apply.

Currently, about 200 million Americans are subject to harmful workplace noise. There are many factors, besides in the workplace, to how noise exposure can affect individuals more or less. These factors can include, but are not limited to, ageing, heredity factors, recreational activities, and some illnesses.

While there are recommendations that exist for noise levels and noise control in communities, there is a lack of general agreement regarding acceptable exposure limits in non-occupational settings or the general environment. To limit noise exposure levels there are several approaches that can be used. One way to limit noise exposure is by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) such as earplugs, or earmuffs. Another way to limit exposure should be reducing being in environments with heavy amounts of noise exposure. With this in mind it is important to keep individuals informed about prolonged noise exposure.

<text>The slug is a derived unit of mass in a weight-based system of measures, most notably within the British Imperial measurement system and the United States customary measures system. Systems of measure either define mass and derive a force unit &quot;or&quot; define a base force and derive a mass unit (cf. &quot;poundal&quot;, a derived unit of force in a mass-based system). A slug is defined as a mass that is accelerated by 1 ft/s2 when a net force of one pound (lbf) is exerted on it.

:formula_1

One slug is a mass equal to based on standard gravity, the international foot, and the avoirdupois pound. In other words, at the Earth&#x27;s surface (in standard gravity), an object with a mass of 1 slug weighs approximately .

== History ==
The &quot;slug&quot; is part of a subset of units known as the gravitational FPS system, one of several such specialized systems of mechanical units developed in the late 19th and the early 20th century. &quot;Geepound&quot; was another name for this unit in early literature.

The name &quot;slug&quot; was coined before 1900 by British physicist Arthur Mason Worthington, but it did not see any significant use until decades later. It is derived from the meaning &quot;solid block of metal&quot; (cf. &quot;slug&quot; fake coin or &quot;slug&quot; projectile), not from the slug mollusc. A 1928 textbook says:


The slug is listed in the Regulations under the Weights and Measures (National Standards) Act, 1960. This regulation defines the units of weights and measures, both regular and metric, in Australia.

== Related units ==
The inch version of the slug (equal to 1 lbf⋅s2/in, or 12slugs) has no official name, but is commonly referred to as a &quot;blob&quot;, &quot;slinch&quot; (a portmanteau of the words slug and inch), &quot;slugette&quot;, or &quot;snail&quot;. It is equivalent to based on standard gravity.

Similar (but long-obsolete) metric units included the &quot;glug&quot; (980.665 g) in a gravitational system related to the centimetre–gram–second system, and the &quot;mug&quot;, &quot;hyl&quot;, &quot;par&quot;, or &quot;TME&quot; (, 9.80665 kg) in a gravitational system related to the metre–kilogram–second system.

<text>The name Frances has been used for nine tropical cyclones worldwide: eight in the Atlantic Ocean and one in the Australian region.

In the Atlantic Ocean:
* Hurricane Frances (1961): Caused flooding in Puerto Rico, peaked at Category 4 west of Bermuda, subtropical at Nova Scotia
* Tropical Storm Frances (1968): Travelled across the central Atlantic Ocean without affecting land
* Hurricane Frances (1976): Curved over the central Atlantic, affected the Azores as an extratropical storm
* Hurricane Frances (1980): Travelled up the central Atlantic Ocean without affecting land
* Hurricane Frances (1986): Briefly drifted over the western Atlantic but never affected land
* Hurricane Frances (1992): Threatened Bermuda but did not strike the island, then hit Spain as an extratropical storm
* Tropical Storm Frances (1998): A weak storm that caused flooding in East Texas and southern Louisiana
* Hurricane Frances (2004): A powerful Category 4 hurricane that struck the Bahamas, and later, as a Category 2 storm, moved extremely slowly over Florida, causing billions in damage

After the 2004 season, the name &quot;Frances&quot; was retired and replaced by &quot;Fiona&quot;, which was first used during the 2010 season.

In the Australian region:
* Cyclone Frances (2017): A relatively strong tropical cyclone which remained off the coasts of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and northern Australia.</text><links>

<text>A slug is a term used for a bulky solid ballistic projectile. It is &quot;solid&quot; in the sense of being composed of one piece; the shape can vary widely, including partially hollowed shapes. The term is occasionally applied to bullets (just the projectile, never the cartridge as a whole), but is most commonly applied to one-piece shotgun slugs, to differentiate them from shotshells containing numerous shots. Slugs are commonly fired from choked smoothbore barrels, but some specially-designed slug barrels have riflings that can impart gyroscopic spin required for in-flight stability.

An airgun slug is a new[when?} type of pellet recently developed for pre-charged pneumatic airguns. Unlike the conventional diabolo-shaped pellet, which is aerodynamically poor and relies heavily on drag-stabilisation to maintain accuracy, the slug pellet is cylindro-conoidally shaped like a Minié ball and relies predominantly on spin-stabilisation from a rifled barrel. Because of the greater contact area with the barrel bore, these pellets require more power from the gun to overcome the frictional resistance, and therefore are mainly used in PCP airguns, which generally have much higher muzzle energy ratings than other types of airguns such as spring-piston, pump pneumatic or HPA/CO2 airguns.

A water-slug refers to operating a submarine&#x27;s torpedo tube that has been filled with water rather than a torpedo, thus shooting a &quot;slug of water.&quot; In simulated naval battles and exercises this is to represent the dispatch of an actual torpedo as, to sonar detectors, the sounds are very alike.

<doc id="902992" wikidata="Q637453" url="?curid=902992" title="Petit Verdot">
<text>Petit Verdot is a variety of red wine grape, principally used in classic Bordeaux blends. It ripens much later than the other varieties in Bordeaux, often too late, so it fell out of favour in its home region. When it does ripen it adds tannin, colour and flavour, in small amounts, to the blend. Petit verdot has attracted attention among winemakers in the New World, where it ripens more reliably and has been made into single varietal wine. It is also useful in &#x27;stiffening&#x27; the mid palate of Cabernet Sauvignon blends.

When young its aromas have been likened to banana and pencil shavings. Strong tones of violet and leather develop as it matures.

==History==
Petit Verdot probably predates Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux, but its origins are unclear. There are records of it in the eighteenth century, but its characteristics suggest an origin in much hotter climes than the Gironde. It is likely that it originates from the Pyrénées-Atlantiques where it was possibly domesticated from wild grapevines.

It is one parent of Tressot, the other parent being Duras, a grape from the upper Tarn valley near Toulouse. It&#x27;s possible that both were brought to the region by the Romans as they moved inland from the Mediterranean.

==Distribution and wines==
===Argentina===
There are some blocks of Petit Verdot in Argentina, although for many years it was labelled as Fer.

===Australia===
Verdot was included in James Busby&#x27;s collection of 1832, and it was trialled by Sir William Macarthur in the 1840s. In 2000 there were 1600 hectares in Australia with Kingston Estate in South Australia having the largest planting, four times more than in France. It is increasingly being used to make massive, brooding, single varietal wines that will age for several years – Pirramimma has championed this approach and Warrumbungle Wines releases only aged / cellar vintages to highlight the aging potential.

===Chile===
Chile had 137 ha in 2003.

===France===
Almost all the Petit Verdot in France is planted in Bordeaux, mostly in the Médoc where it is used in small amounts to give structure to the classic Bordeaux blend. However the late ripening means that in some years the entire crop is lost and it only properly ripens once every four years, so it has fallen out of favour, particularly with the trend towards earlier-maturing wine.

===Italy===
In Italy, it is sometimes cultivated in Maremma (Tuscany) and Lazio.

===Lebanon===
In Lebanon, it is sometime found in Bekaa Valley, and be added to cabernet sauvignon and merlot.

===Peru===
In Peru, Petit Verdot vines are grown in the southern Ica Region. The desert weather from Ica allows producers to make 100% varietal Petit Verdot wines. Tacama winery produces one of its high end wines, &quot;Don Manuel&quot;, with 100% Petit Verdot grapes.

===Portugal===
In Portugal it is sometime cultivated in Alentejo with great results due to this region&#x27;s specific climatic conditions.

===United States===
The profusion of Meritage Bordeaux blends has seen considerable interest in the variety in California, where there was 360 ha in 2003. The more consistent, warmer climate is a big help in reliably ripening the grape, and producers are starting to experiment with single varietals. It is also planted in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, Texas, Michigan, Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, New Mexico, and Washington.

In addition to the countries above, Petit Verdot is used as &#x27;seasoning&#x27; in Bordeaux-style blends in British Columbia, New Zealand, South Africa and Spain.

==Vine and viticulture==
The leaves have three to five lobes with a distinctively elongated central lobe. The small, cylindrical bunches are winged, with small black berries.

The name Petit Verdot (&#x27;small green&#x27;) refers to one of the main problems with the grape, that often the berries fail to develop properly without the right weather during flowering. It also refers to the late ripening which usually comes too late for the Bordeaux climate. Petit Verdot also has a peculiar characteristic in that it produces more than two clusters per shoot.

==Synonyms==
Bouton, Carmelin, Heran, Lambrusquet Noir, Petit Verdau, Petit Verdot Noir, Verdot and Verdot Rouge.
