<doc id="875862" wikidata="Q1686485" url="?curid=875862" title="Jeff Immelt">
<text>Jeffrey Robert Immelt (born February 19, 1956) is an American manufacturing executive working as a venture partner at New Enterprise Associates. He previously was the CEO of General Electric from 2001 to 2017, and the CEO of GE&#x27;s Medical Systems division from 1997 to 2000. Immelt&#x27;s tenure saw GE&#x27;s largest divestments in the company&#x27;s history, as the company sold almost two-thirds of its subsidiaries and assets.

==Early life and education==
Immelt was born on February 19, 1956, in Cincinnati, the son of Donna Rosemary (née Wallace), a school teacher, and Joseph Francis Immelt, who managed the General Electric Aircraft Engines Division.

Immelt attended Finneytown Secondary Campus. There he captained the football and basketball teams. In college he played football and was an offensive tackle. He earned an A.B. in applied mathematics and economics &quot;cum laude&quot; from Dartmouth College in 1978. He was president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Alpha.

During his years at Dartmouth he worked summers on a Ford assembly line in Cincinnati; after graduating he worked for Procter &amp; Gamble, where he shared a cubicle with Steve Ballmer, who went on to become CEO of Microsoft. He obtained an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1982 and described business school as &quot;one of the most intense times of your life.&quot; He was later offered to work for Morgan Stanley, which he declined. Instead, he wanted to work for General Electric like his father.

== General Electric ==
Immelt joined General Electric in 1982, working in GE&#x27;s plastics, appliances, and healthcare businesses. He became a GE corporate officer in 1989, joined the GE Capital board in 1997 and took the reins of the corporate leadership of GE Healthcare before assuming his position as CEO in 2001.

===Tenure as CEO===
Four days after Immelt became CEO, the September 11 attacks took place which cost GE&#x27;s insurance division $600 million, killed two employees and directly affected the company&#x27;s Aircraft Engines sector. After becoming CEO, Immelt offered an expanded set of financial reports in addition to GE&#x27;s traditional format.

Immelt participated actively in mergers and acquisitions, purchasing Amersham PLC for $9.5 billion in 2004 and Alstom&#x27;s power business for approximately €12.4  billion in 2015. Immelt sold GE&#x27;s plastics business for $11.6 billion in 2007, NBC Universal for $8 billion in 2013, and GE&#x27;s appliances business for $3.3 billion in 2014. In 2015, GE announced it would sell its real estate holdings for $26.5 billion and most of GE Capital&#x27;s assets.

During Immelt&#x27;s tenure as CEO, the company&#x27;s financial performance suffered considerably, as shares of GE dropped 30 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 rose by 134% over the same period of time, which had led to suspicions of his managerial competencies to be called into question when running the day-to-day operations of the corporation. GE restated its earnings in 2005 and agreed to pay the SEC $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud in 2009.

GE received aid from the Federal Reserve while not paying federal income taxes became a political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, although GE did pay taxes in other jurisdictions. At the end of 2012, over $100 billion had been kept offshore to avoid a special federal repatriation tax. In 2015, GE announced a repatriation program for part of its cash balances. In 2016, GE moved its headquarters from Connecticut to Massachusetts, citing Connecticut&#x27;s tax increases.

Immelt had an empty private jet following his own private jet, in case there were delays with his primary jet.

====Employment====
At the end of 2001 when Immelt replaced Jack Welch, GE employed 219,000 worldwide and 125,000 in the US, as reported in its SEC Form 10K for 2001. GE&#x27;s SEC Form 10K for 2014 states that worldwide employment is 305,000, and US employment is 136,000. These employment levels have varied significantly under Immelt.

General Electric year end employment has varied from 273,000 in 2010 to 305,000 in 2014, a net increase of 37,000. Employment had dropped from 315,000 in 2002 to 307,000 in 2013.

===Executive compensation and retirement===
Immelt&#x27;s executive compensation has fluctuated significantly throughout his managerial career. As CEO of General Electric in 2007, Immelt received a total compensation of $14,209,267. In 2008, he received a total compensation of $5,717,469. In 2009, Immelt received a total compensation of $5,487,155. In 2010, Immelt&#x27;s compensation nearly tripled to $15.2 million. Immelt had a total five year compensation of $53.82 million through 2011, an income which ranked sixth among executives employed by US-based conglomerates. Some components of his total compensation package over the years have been newsworthy. In some years he was granted stock options at $0, and in other years he was paid no bonus. In 2014 his compensation totalled $18.8 million, a decrease from his 2013 compensation of $25.8 million. That 2013 compensation had risen 20% over his 2012 compensation of $20.6 million.

On June 12, 2017, GE announced that Immelt would retire as CEO and would be replaced by John L. Flannery. Immelt stepped down in October 2017.

== Later career ==

=== Uber ===
Immelt was initially a top candidate to become CEO of Uber, replacing founder Travis Kalanick. He was initially Kalanick&#x27;s favorite for the post, in part because he was still open to Kalanick still having a significant role. However, Immelt&#x27;s presentation before the board was poorly received; one director called it &quot;a bad joke,&quot; and even Kalanick soured on him. Immelt withdrew from consideration after a director privately told him he had no chance at getting the job.

=== athenahealth ===
On February 7, 2018, Immelt became the executive chairman of the board at athenahealth, a private American health care company that provides network-enabled services for point-of-care mobile apps. Immelt joined the board of directors of Radiology Partners two weeks later. On June 6, 2018, Immelt was named executive chairman of athenahealth. Athenahealth was later acquired by Veritas Capital in 2019.

=== Tuya Smart ===
Immelt became a board member of Tuya Smart in September 2019. Immelt attended the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020 on behalf of Tuya Smart.

=== Built Robotics ===
On June 30, 2020, Immelt was announced as an advisor to Built Robotics, a company develops vehicular automation hardware and software. He joined Eric Sellman, Vice President of Civil at Mortenson, in the role.

==Philanthropy==
===Charitable activities===
Immelt is also an active philanthropist. He is on the board of two non-profit organizations. He was a Charter Trustee of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Dartmouth, from 2008 to 2016. He has also served Dartmouth on its Alumni Council and as a class officer.

Immelt has spoken about the benefits of football to his career. He announced a series of initiatives with NFL Commissioner Goodell including a GE investment of $40 million to develop diagnostic equipment for use in head trauma injuries, and GE&#x27;s participation in a separate $20 million effort to develop safer helmets and other equipment.

The GE Foundation has been praised for its charitable contributions under Immelt&#x27;s leadership.

Immelt has returned to his hometown High School, Finneytown, to contribute to the Finneytown Schools Education Foundation. The Foundation established the Jeff Immelt Award for leadership in football.

===Public service===
Immelt was chairman of The Business Council from 2005 to 2006.

Immelt was as a member of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2006 to 2011.

As one of America&#x27;s top CEOs, Immelt has been a leading proponent of diversity in the work place, saying &quot;If you&#x27;re serious about ... making the world work better, the only discriminating factor should be excellence. In other words, GE is committed to diversity ...[because] ... it&#x27;s the only way to do business right ... [GE is] committed to employing a diverse workforce with the most innovative minds in the world.&quot;

Immelt was appointed to the President&#x27;s Economic Recovery Advisory Board in 2009 and appointed chairman in 2011. The council met four times, ending on January 17, 2012.

==Honors==
Jeff Immelt has earned significant honors throughout his career, beginning with his graduation from Dartmouth &quot;cum laude&quot; and earning the Earl Hamilton Varsity Award, as a college football player, for friendship and character. Later in 2002, he received the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth&#x27;s Thayer School of Engineering.

===Career honors===
Barron&#x27;s has named Immelt one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Best CEOs&quot; three times; other outlets have criticized his performance. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences. The Financial Times named him &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in 2003. Immelt was named to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people in the world in 2009.

In 2009, Immelt won the Oslo Business for Peace Award, an award chosen by winners of the Nobel Prizes in Economics and Peace and given to managerial executives in the private sector who have demonstrated transformative and positive change through ethical business practices.

Immelt was awarded the 2014 American Football Coaches Association Tuss McLaughry Award, given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others. In accepting the award, he said &quot;I am a product of football and I owe a great debt of gratitude to that system. What I learned playing football enters my life every day.&quot;

In April 2015, Immelt won the 20th edition of the Leonardo International Prize &quot;as a foreigner who reinforced his country&#x27;s cultural and economic ties with Italy.&quot;

On 24 December 2015, Immelt was ranked by the British online business blog and magazine Richtopia at number 50 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEOs.

<doc id="875865" wikidata="Q6571554" url="?curid=875865" title="List of GM engines">
<text>This list of GM engines encompasses all engines manufactured by General Motors and used in its cars.

==Divisions==

When General Motors was created in 1908, it started out with Buick and soon after acquired Oldsmobile, Cadillac and Oakland. There were dozens of other smaller companies that William Durant acquired during his first employment term until he was let go due to financially overextending his purchases. He regained control when he brought on Chevrolet in 1917 which was short lived until he was let go for the second time. This meant that the different core brands designed and manufactured their own engines with few interchangeable parts between brands, while sharing chassis, suspension and transmissions. 

One of the companies Durant bought in 1909 was the Northway Motor and Manufacturing Company founded by Ralph Northway who had previously supplied engines to Buick, Oakland, Cartercar and other 1900s manufacturers, including V8 engines to Oldsmobile, Oakland and Cadillac when they were independent companies. When Durant bought companies that became part of GM, Northway continued to supply engines to his former clients and added Cadillac, GMC and Oldsmobile to the list, then Northway Motors became the Northway Motor and Manufacturing Division in 1925 and became part of the GM Intercompany Parts Group. 

When Fisher Body was bought in 1925, coachwork was shared and with the introduction of the Art and Color Section also in the late 1920, GM products shared appearances. The core items that made each brand unique were the engines. Buick and Chevrolet used overhead valves while Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Oakland used side valve or flathead engines and the divisions no longer outsourced their engines and manufactured them according to particular brand requirements. The original factory location was located at Maybury Grand Avenue, Buchanan Street and the Grand Trunk Railway in Detroit then later became GM truck Plant No. 7 in 1926 to manufacture front and rear axles and parts for past model Chevrolets. Starting around 1925 engine blocks and cylinder heads were now developed at each brand but were cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations. In the mid-1960s, there were 8 separate families of GM V8 engines on sale in the USA.

By the 1970s, GM began to see problems with their approach. For instance, four different North American divisions (Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick) offered four completely different versions of a 350 cu in V8 engine - very few parts would interchange between the four designs despite their visual similarities, resulting in confusion for owners who naturally assumed that replacement parts would be usable across brands. In addition to these issues and the obvious overlap in production costs, the cost of certifying so many different engines for tightening worldwide emissions regulations threatened to become very costly.

Thus, by the early 1980s, GM had consolidated its powertrain engineering efforts into a few distinct lines. Generally, North American and European engineering units remained separate, with Australia&#x27;s Holden and other global divisions borrowing designs from one or the other as needed. GM also worked out sharing agreements with other manufacturers such as Isuzu and Nissan to fill certain gaps in engineering. Similarly, the company also purchased other automotive firms (including Saab and Daewoo), eventually folding their engine designs into the corporate portfolio as well. GM later reorganized its Powertrain Division into GM Global Propulsion Systems, located at 800 N Glenwood Avenue in Pontiac, Michigan, which became the GM Global Product Group in March 2020 and is in close proximity to the old location of Pontiac Assembly.

GM&#x27;s German subsidiary, Opel, relies on a range of three-, four- and six-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines. A survey of their range shows a reliance on petrol and diesel four-cylinders, and in 2014, there was only one 3-cylinder engine and one 6 cylinder engine in service in Opel&#x27;s passenger car range.

In addition to automobile and truck engines, GM produced industrial engines, which were sold by brands such as Detroit Diesel, Allison, and Electro-Motive. Most of these engine designs are unrelated to GM&#x27;s automotive engines.

==Other diesel engines==

GM entered the diesel field with its acquisition of the Cleveland-based Winton Engine Company in 1930. Winton&#x27;s main client was the Electro Motive Company, a producer of internal combustion-electric rail motorcars. GM acquired Electro Motive at roughly the same time as Winton.

A partnership of GM&#x27;s Research and Development Division and their Winton Engine Corporation delivered their first diesel engines suitable for mobile use starting in 1934. The engines were also sold for marine and stationary applications. In a 1938 reorganization, Winton Engine Corporation became the GM Cleveland Diesel Engine Division, and GM&#x27;s Detroit Diesel Engine Division began production of smaller ( per cylinder) diesel engines. Locomotive engines were moved under the GM Electro Motive Division (EMD) in 1941, while Cleveland Diesel retained development and production of large marine and stationary engines.

Cleveland Diesel was dissolved in 1962 and their remaining production moved to EMD. In 1988, the Detroit Diesel Engine Division was incorporated as an independent company, later acquired by DaimlerChrysler in 2005. EMD was sold off by GM in 2005 and is now a subsidiary of Progress Rail.

<doc id="875871" wikidata="Q3595484" url="?curid=875871" title="Bowling average">
<text>In cricket, a player&#x27;s bowling average is the number of runs they have conceded per wicket taken. The lower the bowling average is, the better the bowler is performing. It is one of a number of statistics used to compare bowlers, commonly used alongside the economy rate and the strike rate to judge the overall performance of a bowler. 

When a bowler has taken only a small number of wickets, their bowling average can be artificially high or low, and unstable, with further wickets taken or runs conceded resulting in large changes to their bowling average. Due to this, qualification restrictions are generally applied when determining which players have the best bowling averages. After applying these criteria, George Lohmann holds the record for the lowest average in Test cricket, having claimed 112 wickets at an average of 10.75 runs per wicket.

==Calculation==
A cricketer&#x27;s bowling average is calculated by dividing the numbers of runs they have conceded by the number of wickets they have taken. The number of runs conceded by a bowler is determined as the total number of runs that the opposing side have scored while the bowler was bowling, excluding any byes, leg byes, or penalty runs. The bowler receives credit for any wickets taken during their bowling that are either bowled, caught, hit wicket, leg before wicket or stumped.

formula_1

A number of flaws have been identified for the statistic, most notable among these the fact that a bowler who has taken no wickets cannot have a bowling average, as dividing by zero does not give a result. The effect of this is that the bowling average cannot distinguish between a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one run, and a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one hundred runs. The bowling average also does not tend to give a true reflection of the bowler&#x27;s ability when the number of wickets they have taken is small, especially in comparison to the number of runs they have conceded. In his paper proposing an alternative method of judging batsmen and bowlers, Paul van Staden gives an example of this:

Suppose a bowler has bowled a total of 80 balls, conceded 60 runs and has taken only 2 wickets so that.. [their average is] 30. If the bowler takes a wicket with the next ball bowled (no runs obviously conceded), then [their average is] 20.

Due to this, when establishing records for bowling averages, qualification criteria are generally set. For Test cricket, the &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; sets this as 75 wickets, while ESPNcricinfo requires 2,000 deliveries. Similar restrictions are set for one-day cricket.

==Variations==
A number of factors other than purely the ability level of the bowler have an effect on a player&#x27;s bowling average. Most significant among these are the different eras in which cricket has been played. The bowling average tables in Test and first-class cricket are headed by players who competed in the nineteenth century, a period when pitches were uncovered and some were so badly looked after that they had rocks on them. The bowlers competing in the Howa Bowl, a competition played in South African during the apartheid-era, restricted to non-white players, during which time, according to Vincent Barnes: &quot;Most of the wickets we played on were underprepared. For me, as a bowler, it was great.&quot; Other factors which provided an advantage to bowlers in that era was the lack of significant safety equipment; batting gloves and helmets were not worn, and batsmen had to be warier. Other variations are caused by frequent matches against stronger or weaker opposition, changes in the laws of cricket and the length of matches.

==Records==
Due to the varying qualifying restrictions placed on the records by different statisticians, the record for the lowest career bowling average can be different from publication to publication. 

===Test cricket===

In Test cricket, George Lohmann is listed as having the superior average by each of the &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, ESPNcricinfo and CricketArchive. Though all three use different restrictions, Lohmann&#x27;s average of 10.75 is considered the best. If no qualification criteria were applied at all, three players—Wilf Barber, A. N. Hornby and Bruce Murray—would tie for the best average, all having claimed just one wicket in Test matches, without conceding any runs, thus averaging zero.

ESPNcricinfo list Betty Wilson as having the best Women&#x27;s Test cricket average with 11.80, while CricketArchive accept Mary Spear&#x27;s average of 5.78. 

===One Day Internationals===

In One Day Internationals, the varying criteria set by ESPNcricinfo and CricketArchive result in same player being listed as holding the record. ESPNcricinfo has the stricter restriction, requiring 1,000 deliveries, where Sandeep Lamichhane is the record-holder, having claimed his wickets at an average of 18.59. CricketArchive has more relaxed requirement of 400 deliveries, where Ali Khan holds the record with an average of 16.42. 

In women&#x27;s One Day International cricket, Caroline Barrs tops the CricketArchive list with an average of 9.52, but by ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s stricter guidelines, the record is instead held by Gill Smith&#x27;s 12.53.

===T20 Internationals===

The record is again split for the two websites for Twenty20 International cricket. In this situation ESPNcricinfo has the boundary of 500 balls to have been bowled, through which Alpesh Ramjani holds the record with an average of 9.29. But the 200 deliveries required by CricketArchive results in Andre Botha being listed as the superior, averaging 8.76.

===First Class cricket===

Domestically, the records for first-class cricket are dominated by players from the nineteenth century, who make up sixteen of the top twenty by ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s criteria of 5,000 deliveries. William Lillywhite, who was active from 1825 to 1853 has the lowest average, claiming his 1,576 wickets at an average of just 1.54. The leading players from the twentieth century are Stephen Draai and Vincent Barnes with averages of just under twelve, both of whom claimed the majority of their wickets in the South African Howa Bowl tournament during the apartheid era.

<doc id="875875" wikidata="Q965154" url="?curid=875875" title="Terrorizer">
<text>Terrorizer is an American grindcore band from Los Angeles, California. It was originally formed in 1985 as Unknown Death by vocalist Oscar Garcia and guitarist Jesse Pintado. They would rename themselves Terrorizer after recruiting drummer Pete Sandoval, who remains the band&#x27;s sole constant member throughout their discography, in 1986. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Sandoval, bassist David Vincent, vocalist Brian Werner and guitarist Richie Brown. They are currently signed to Earache Records.

Terrorizer struggled to find success during their initial existence, and would disband in 1988 after Sandoval left to join Morbid Angel. They were briefly regrouped by David Vincent to record their highly influential debut album &quot;World Downfall&quot; (1989), before they split up again later that year when Pintado left to join Napalm Death. In 2005, Pintado and Sandoval reformed Terrorizer without Garcia, recording and released their second album &quot;Darker Days Ahead&quot; in 2006. Terrorizer became inactive once again due to Pintado&#x27;s death only five days after the album&#x27;s release on August 27, 2006. After being revived by Sandoval in 2009, Terrorizer has released two more albums, &quot;Hordes of Zombies&quot; (2012) and &quot;Caustic Attack&quot; (2018), each featuring a different lineup.

== History ==
=== Early history (1985–1988) ===
In 1985, after a brief stint in a band called Majesty, Oscar Garcia began searching around the Los Angeles area for musicians he could form a band with which he could front as both a vocalist and guitarist. Garcia first met guitarist Jesse Pintado, and after helping each other with their guitar skills, the two formed a thrash metal band known as Unknown Death. Afterwards, Garcia and Pintado recruited bassist Alfred &quot;Garvey&quot; Estrada and a drummer mononymously known as &quot;Fish&quot;.

Initially taking inspiration from thrash metal acts such as Slayer and Celtic Frost, Garcia and Pintado would soon decide to take Unknown Death in a faster direction, after Pintado received a demo tape featuring what would become the A-side to Napalm Death&#x27;s &quot;Scum&quot; (1987). Garcia recalled: &quot;I remember one day, [Pintado] said, &#x27;Check this out&#x27;. And when I listened to it for the first time, I called him and said, &#x27;That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s the way I wanna play&#x27;.&quot; Fish was unable to play to the speeds that Garcia and Pintado wanted, and he soon left the band. Upon the recommendation of a friend, drummer Pete Sandoval auditioned for Unknown Death and was instantly hired. &quot;The first beat that [Sandoval] played was a superfast beat, and when we heard that, Jesse and I looked at each other and we looked at Pete, and we were like, &#x27;Hey man, you wanna join this band?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;You guys haven&#x27;t seen me play.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;We&#x27;ve heard enough&#x27;.&quot; Sandoval&#x27;s drumming style complemented Unknown Death&#x27;s older songs, and Garcia felt that &quot;everything just started to click&quot; musically when he joined the band. Unknown Death soon changed their name to Decomposed, and then to Terrorizer, after a song of the same name by Master.

Having attainted a stable line-up, Terrorizer began playing around the Los Angeles area, performing their first show at the Hoover Recreation Centre on March 21, 1987. The band released four rehearsal/demo tapes during 1987 that were circulated throughout the underground tape-trading scene. Terrorizer were limited to performing in small venues or at backyard parties for most of their initial existence, and struggled to attract record label interest due to the speed and intensity of their music, which made them unappealing to both the heavy metal and punk rock audiences of the Los Angeles area. In the summer of 1988, with both interest in and activity within Terrorizer waning, Sandoval was presented with the opportunity to join the Florida-based death metal band Morbid Angel by the band&#x27;s bassist, David Vincent. He would subsequently announce to the other members of Terrorizer during a band rehearsal with new bassist Carlos Reveles (who Garcia had played with back in Majesty) that he was leaving to join Morbid Angel, resulting in their disbandment. Garcia recalled of Sandoval&#x27;s departure: &quot;At the time I thought we [Terrorizer] were just about ready to do an album. Then one day out of the blue at a practice, Pete just busted out saying that he was leaving the band and that he was moving out of state. And that was pretty much it for us then. It was like we never had a chance.&quot;

=== &quot;World Downfall&quot; and disbandment (1989–2004) ===
In early 1989, whilst he was in England delivering the master tapes of Morbid Angel&#x27;s debut album &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; to the offices of Earache Records, David Vincent discussed Terrorizer with the label&#x27;s founder, Digby Pearson. Pearson told Vincent that Terrorizer had been signed to Earache before Morbid Angel were, but that he had struggled to get the band to record an album due to its members being based in differing locations. Vincent subsequently offered to regroup Terrorizer to record an album, should Earache be interested in releasing one.

In April 1989, Garcia and Pintado travelled to Tampa, Florida, where both Vincent and Sandoval were based, to record Terrorizer&#x27;s debut album &quot;World Downfall&quot;. The band spent two weeks of &quot;[rehearsing] all the songs like crazy&quot; to make them sound as tight as they could be (according to Vincent) before going into Morrisound Recording, where they recorded and mixed the album in the space of three days with engineer Scott Burns. According to Burns, the album was recorded on a budget of $1,200. Pintado played all of the guitars on the album at Garcia&#x27;s insistence, as he had not played guitar for six months and did not want to hold up recording. Furthermore, as Terrorizer did not have a bassist at the time and because Pintado and Garcia did not have any bass equipment, Vincent ended up playing bass on the album. Although he is credited as both the producer of &quot;World Downfall&quot; and Terrorizer&#x27;s bassist in the album&#x27;s liner notes, Vincent later claimed that he &quot;just played on the record&quot; and was not an official member of the band (at that point).

&quot;World Downfall&quot; was released via Earache on November 13, 1989. Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, Pintado left Terrorizer to join Napalm Death, before the start of the band&#x27;s Grindcrusher Tour in November 1989. With Vincent and Sandoval refocusing their attention on Morbid Angel—who were also participating in the Grindcrusher Tour as a supporting act (along with Carcass and Bolt Thrower)—Terrorizer disbanded for a second time. Garcia subsequently returned to his other band, Nausea. In the 2018 documentary film &quot;Slave to the Grind: A Film About Grindcore&quot;, Sandoval said of Terrorizer&#x27;s disbandment:&quot;There was not a lot of interest in Terrorizer, and plus, these other bands, for us, were big bands, y&#x27;know. Morbid Angel, they had like, a beginning of a history, you know what I mean? So it was something cool, nice for me to join. And then Napalm Death, another big band... so it was what it was supposed to be, man.&quot;&quot;World Downfall&quot; has retrospectively been seen as one of the classics of early grindcore. Morbid Angel would later incorporate the album track &quot;Dead Shall Rise&quot; into their setlists during their tours in support of &quot;Blessed Are the Sick&quot; (1991), which Vincent said the band were happy to do as &quot;half of Morbid Angel had been in Terrorizer&quot;. Although Terrorizer were still under contract for another album with Earache, attempts to make another album with the &quot;World Downfall&quot; line-up of the band were unsuccessful due to its members&#x27; conflicting schedules. Garcia claims not to have talked to Sandoval since Terrorizer&#x27;s disbandment.

=== Later history and albums. disbandment and reformation (2005–present) ===
In 2005, after leaving Napalm Death, Pintado agreed to reform Terrorizer with Sandoval to release another album, &quot;Darker Days Ahead&quot;, through Century Media Records in August 2006. Garcia declined to join the reunion due to creative differences with Pintado, who wanted him to leave Nausea—he was subsequently replaced by Anthony Rezhawk. Tony Norman also joined the band on guitar and bass; Pintado had been recording and playing shows with Rezhawk&#x27;s band Resistant Culture and asked him to join Terrorizer. Pintado would die five days after the album&#x27;s release due to liver failure.

In 2009, Terrorizer released a new demo track, &quot;Hordes of Zombies&quot;, on its MySpace page. In June 2011, Terrorizer signed to Season of Mist, and released its third album, &quot;Hordes of Zombies&quot;, on February 28, 2012. Resistant Culture guitarist Katina Culture replaced Pintado and David Vincent rejoined on bass.

In November 2012, Sandoval announced that Terrorizer started writing new material for their next album. The fourth album &quot;Caustic Attack&quot; was released in 2018 under The End Records.

On August 9, 2021, Earache Records announced a new worldwide record deal with Terrorizer, as well as revealing that a new album was in the works.

On January 22, 2023, Sandoval announced the split of Terrorizer and would shift his attention to his other band I Am Morbid. However, on August 12, Sandoval reformed Terrorizer with Vincent, alongside former Vital Remains vocalist Brian Werner and guitarist Richie Brown.

== Terrorizer LA ==

In 2014, Oscar Garcia was invited by Jesse Pintado&#x27;s sister to put together a new lineup of Terrorizer (his version known as Terrorizer LA or TLA) for a festival celebrating what would have been Jesse Pintado&#x27;s 45th birthday. He asked fellow Nausea member Leon del Muerte (Murder Construct) to play guitar, and shortly afterward Cosmo Reveles, Rick Cortez (Sadistic Intent) and Mike Caffell (Dreaming Dead, Exhausted Prayer) were recruited to fill out the band. The band continues to play under the Terrorizer LA name.

&quot;Before The Downfall,&quot; a collection of demos and unreleased material, was released by FOAD Records in 2015.

<text>Yudit is a Unicode text editor for the X Window System. It also support Linux and Macx86 64-bit as well as ARM 64-bit-v8. It was first released on 1997-11-08. It can do TrueType font rendering, printing, transliterated keyboard input and handwriting recognition with no dependencies on external engines. Yudit&#x27;s lack of dependence on user interface libraries like QT or GTK+ gives the software its unique look.

Yudit&#x27;s conversion utilities can convert text between various encodings. Keyboard input maps can also act like text converters. There is no need for a pre-installed multi-lingual environment. Menus are translated into multiple languages.

The developer states that &quot;since the early days of Unicode on Linux&quot;, support has improved making future versions of the program unlikely, though documentation may be updated.

It supports simultaneous processing of many languages, input methods, conversions for local character standards etc. It has facilities for entering text in all languages with only an English keyboard, using keyboard configuration maps.

The author of Yudit is Gáspár Sinai, a Hungarian programmer, living and working in Japan.

<text>Joel Silver (born July 14, 1952) is an American film producer.

==Life and career==
Silver was born and raised in South Orange, New Jersey, the son of a writer and a public relations executive. His family is Jewish. He attended Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. During his time there, Silver, Buzzy Hellring, and Jonny Hines created the rules for what he called &quot;Ultimate Frisbee&quot;. He was later inducted into the USA Ultimate Hall of Fame as a result of this. He finished his undergraduate studies at the New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts.

Silver began his career at Lawrence Gordon Productions, where he eventually became president of motion pictures for the company. He earned his first screen credit as the associate producer on &quot;The Warriors&quot; and, with Gordon, produced &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;, and &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;. In 1985, he formed Silver Pictures and produced successful action films such as &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; franchise, the first two films of the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series, as well as the first two films of the &quot;Predator&quot; series and &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise of action films.

Silver appears on-screen at the beginning of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; as Raoul J. Raoul, the director of the animated short &quot;Something&#x27;s Cookin&quot;. Raoul loses his temper at toon Roger Rabbit for seeing tweety birds when a refrigerator crashes on his head, and not stars as the script specified. This was a prank Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis pulled on then-Disney CEO, Michael Eisner, as Eisner and Silver had despised each other since their days at Paramount Pictures in the early 1980s, especially with the issues they faced making &quot;48 Hrs&quot;. Silver trimmed his beard off, paid his expenses, and asked to not have his name in initial cast lists. Reportedly, when production wrapped, because Silver was unrecognizable, Eisner questioned who played Raoul and was told it was Silver, at which point, Eisner shrugged and praised his performance.

Silver directed &quot;Split Personality&quot;, (1992), an episode of the HBO horror anthology &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. He has run two production companies, Silver Pictures, and Dark Castle Entertainment, co-owned by Robert Zemeckis.

Silver is also known for his eccentric temper, inspiring characters based on him in movies such as &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot;. The character of Les Grossman (played by Tom Cruise) in the movie &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, is a parody of Silver. Actor Rick Moranis parodied Silver on SCTV in the skit &quot;The Larry Siegel Talk Show&quot;.

He also voiced &quot;the police chief&quot; in the 2001 film &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot; in an uncredited role.

On June 24, 2019, Silver Pictures CEO Hal Sadoff announced that Silver had resigned from the company. Two days later, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; cited unnamed sources claiming that Joel Silver&#x27;s overspending, dearth of recent box-office hits, and an animosity between Silver and financier Daryl Katz led to Silver&#x27;s departure. No official reason has yet been given by the Katz Group, Silver Pictures, or Joel Silver himself.

On November 30, 2023, Silver was fired as a producer of &quot;Play Dirty&quot; by Amazon Studios.

===Frank Lloyd Wright houses and automobiles===
Silver is well known as an aficionado of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1984, he bought the Wright-designed Storer House in Hollywood and made considerable investments to restore it to its original condition. The Storer House&#x27;s squarish relief ornament then became the company logo of Silver Pictures. Silver sold it in 2002 for $2.9 million. In 1986, he purchased the long-neglected C. Leigh Stevens Auldbrass Plantation in Yemassee, South Carolina, and has been restoring it since then. Both restorations have been managed and supervised by the architect Eric Lloyd Wright (grandson of Frank Lloyd Wright).

Silver has also owned and restored two Lincoln Continental automobiles previously owned by Wright, one a 1940 convertible and the other a 1941 coupe. After the 1940 car was damaged, Wright had a body shop rebuild the car based on his custom redesign. For a time both cars were displayed in the Storer House.

===Carmel Musgrove incident===
On August 19, 2015, Silver&#x27;s 28-year-old assistant Carmel Musgrove drowned in a lagoon while working on vacation with Silver and his family in Bora Bora. Later, in August 2017, Musgrove&#x27;s family sued Silver and his assistant Martin Herold, arguing the latter had provided her with cocaine, which, along with alcohol consumption and exhaustion from work, they alleged had contributed to her death. Silver was exonerated in February 2021 by a Los Angeles judge.

<doc id="875883" wikidata="Q215509" url="?curid=875883" title="Hospital-acquired infection">
<text>A hospital-acquired infection, also known as a nosocomial infection (from the Greek , meaning &quot;hospital&quot;), is an infection that is acquired in a hospital or other healthcare facility. To emphasize both hospital and nonhospital settings, it is sometimes instead called a healthcare-associated infection. Such an infection can be acquired in a hospital, nursing home, rehabilitation facility, outpatient clinic, diagnostic laboratory or other clinical settings. A number of dynamic processes can bring contamination into operating rooms and other areas within nosocomial settings. Infection is spread to the susceptible patient in the clinical setting by various means. Healthcare staff also spread infection, in addition to contaminated equipment, bed linens, or air droplets. The infection can originate from the outside environment, another infected patient, staff that may be infected, or in some cases, the source of the infection cannot be determined. In some cases the microorganism originates from the patient&#x27;s own skin microbiota, becoming opportunistic after surgery or other procedures that compromise the protective skin barrier. Though the patient may have contracted the infection from their own skin, the infection is still considered nosocomial since it develops in the health care setting. The term &quot;nosocomial infection&quot; is used when there is a lack of evidence that the infection was present when the patient entered the healthcare setting, thus meaning it was acquired or became problematic post-admission.

==Effects==

During 2002 in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that roughly 1.7 million healthcare-associated infections, from all types of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi combined, caused or contributed to 99,000 deaths. In Europe, where hospital surveys have been conducted, the category of gram-negative infections are estimated to account for two-thirds of the 25,000 deaths each year. Nosocomial infections can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream and other parts of the body. Many types display antimicrobial resistance, which can complicate treatment.

In the UK about 300,000 patients were affected in 2017, and this was estimated to cost the NHS about £1 billion a year.

==Types==

* Hospital-acquired pneumonia
** Ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Urinary tract infection
* Gastroenteritis
* Puerperal fever
* Central line-associated blood stream infection
===Organisms===

* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;
* Methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;
* &quot;Candida albicans&quot;
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;
* &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&#x27;
* &quot;Stenotrophomonas maltophilia&quot;
* &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
* Tuberculosis
* Vancomycin-resistant &quot;Enterococcus&quot;
* Legionnaires&#x27; disease
== Cause ==

=== Transmission ===
In-dwelling catheters have recently been identified with hospital-acquired infections. To deal with this complication, procedures are used, called intravascular antimicrobial lock therapy, that can reduce infections that are unexposed to blood-borne antibiotics. Introducing antibiotics, including ethanol, into the catheter (without flushing it into the bloodstream) reduces the formation of biofilms.
Contact transmission is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact transmission and indirect-contact transmission.
==== Patient susceptibility ====
Alongside reducing vectors for transmission, patient susceptibility to hospital-acquired infections needs to be considered. Factors which render patients at greater risk of infections include:

# Receipt of immunosuppressive medications such as glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive drugs as part of treatments for cancer, organ transplantation or autoimmune diseases
# Impaired immunity due to diseases such as haematological malignancy, primary immunodeficiency, HIV/AIDS or critical illness, including severe COVID-19
# Presence of indwelling devices which breach natural defences, including endotracheal tubes, central venous catheters and urinary catheters.
# The use of antibiotics does not, itself, increase risk of hospital-acquired infections, but does contribute to the prevalence of Antimicrobial resistant organisms amongst patients with hospital-acquired infections

==== Device-associated infections ====
Given the association between invasive devices and hospital-acquired infections, specific terms are used to delineate such infections to allow for monitoring and prevention. Noted device-associated infections include ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated blood stream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections and device-associated ventriculitis. Surveillance for these infections is commonly undertaken and reported by bodies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

==Prevention==

Controlling nosocomial infection is to implement QA/QC measures to the health care sectors, and evidence-based management can be a feasible approach. For those with ventilator-associated or hospital-acquired pneumonia, controlling and monitoring hospital indoor air quality needs to be on agenda in management, whereas for nosocomial rotavirus infection, a hand hygiene protocol has to be enforced.

To reduce the number of hospital-acquired infections, the state of Maryland implemented the Maryland Hospital-Acquired Conditions Program that provides financial rewards and penalties for individual hospitals. An adaptation of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services payment policy causes poor-performing hospitals to lose up to 3% of their inpatient revenues, whereas hospitals that are able to decrease hospital-acquired infections can earn up to 3% in rewards. During the program&#x27;s first two years, complication rates fell by 15.26% across all hospital-acquired conditions tracked by the state (including those not covered by the program), from a risk-adjusted complication rate of 2.38 per 1,000 people in 2009 to a rate of 2.02 in 2011. The 15.26% decline translates into more than $100 million in cost savings for the health care system in Maryland, with the largest savings coming from avoidance of urinary tract infections, sepsis and other severe infections, and pneumonia and other lung infections. If similar results could be achieved nationwide, the Medicare program would save an estimated $1.3 billion over two years, while the US healthcare system as a whole would save $5.3 billion.

=== Sanitation ===
Hospitals have sanitation protocols regarding uniforms, equipment sterilization, washing, and other preventive measures. Thorough hand washing and/or use of alcohol rubs by all medical personnel before and after each patient contact is one of the most effective ways to combat nosocomial infections. More careful use of antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, is also considered vital. As many hospital-acquired infections caused by bacteria such as methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, methicillin-susceptible &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; are caused by a breach of these protocols, it is common that affected patients make medical negligence claims against the hospital in question.

Sanitizing surfaces is part of control measures to reduce nosocomial infections in healthcare environments. Modern sanitizing methods such as Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems have been effective against gastroenteritis, methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and influenza agents. The use of hydrogen peroxide vapor has been clinically proven to reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition. Hydrogen peroxide is effective against endospore-forming bacteria, such as &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, whereas alcohol is ineffective. Ultraviolet cleaning devices may also be used to disinfect the rooms of patients infected with &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; or methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; after discharge.

Despite sanitation protocol, patients cannot be entirely isolated from infectious agents. Furthermore, patients are often prescribed antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs to help treat illness; this may increase the selection pressure for the emergence of resistant strains.

===Sterilization===
Sterilization goes further than just sanitizing. It kills all microorganisms on equipment and surfaces through exposure to chemicals, ionizing radiation, dry heat, or steam under pressure.

===Isolation===

Isolation is the implementation of isolating precautions designed to prevent transmission of microorganisms by common routes in hospitals. (See Universal precautions and Transmission-based precautions.) Because agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of transfer of microorganisms is directed primarily at transmission for example isolation of infectious cases in special hospitals and isolation of patient with infected wounds in special rooms also isolation of joint transplantation patients on specific rooms.

===Handwashing===
Handwashing frequently is called the single most important measure to reduce the risks of transmitting skin microorganisms from one person to another or from one site to another on the same patient. Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions.
The spread of nosocomial infections, among immunocompromised patients is connected with health care workers&#x27; hand contamination in almost 40% of cases, and is a challenging problem in the modern hospitals. The best way for workers to overcome this problem is conducting correct hand-hygiene procedures; this is why the WHO launched in 2005 the GLOBAL Patient Safety Challenge.

Two categories of micro-organisms can be present on health care workers&#x27; hands: transient flora and resident flora. The first is represented by the micro-organisms taken by workers from the environment, and the bacteria in it are capable of surviving on the human skin and sometimes to grow. The second group is represented by the permanent micro-organisms living on the skin surface (on the stratum corneum or immediately under it). They are capable of surviving on the human skin and to grow freely on it. They have low pathogenicity and infection rate, and they create a kind of protection from the colonization from other more pathogenic bacteria. The skin of workers is colonized by 3.9 × 104 – 4.6 × 106 cfu/cm2. The microbes comprising the resident flora are: &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus hominis&quot;, and &quot;Micrococcus&quot;, &quot;Propionibacterium&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, &quot;Dermabacter&quot;, and &quot;Pittosporum&quot; spp., while transient organisms are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Acinetobacter, Enterobacter&quot; and &quot;Candida&quot; spp. The goal of hand hygiene is to eliminate the transient flora with a careful and proper performance of hand washing, using different kinds of soap, (normal and antiseptic), and alcohol-based gels. The main problems found in the practice of hand hygiene is connected with the lack of available sinks and time-consuming performance of hand washing. An easy way to resolve this problem could be the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, because of faster application compared to correct hand-washing.

Improving patient hand washing has also been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Patients who are bed-bound often do not have as much access to clean their hands at mealtimes or after touching surfaces or handling waste such as tissues. By reinforcing the importance of handwashing and providing sanitizing gel or wipes within reach of the bed, nurses were directly able to reduce infection rates. A study published in 2017 demonstrated this by improving patient education on both proper hand-washing procedure and important times to use sanitizer and successfully reduced the rate of enterococci and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

All visitors must follow the same procedures as hospital staff to adequately control the spread of infections. Moreover, multidrug-resistant infections can leave the hospital and become part of the community flora if steps are not taken to stop this transmission.

It is unclear whether or not nail polish or rings affected surgical wound infection rates.

===Gloves===
In addition to hand washing, gloves play an important role in reducing the risks of transmission of microorganisms. Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of bloodborne pathogen infections. Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient&#x27;s mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms from a patient or a fomite can transmit those micro-organisms to another patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts, and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.

===Antimicrobial surfaces===
Micro-organisms are known to survive on inanimate &quot;touch&quot; surfaces for extended periods of time. This can be especially troublesome in hospital environments where immunodeficient patients are at enhanced risk for contracting nosocomial infections. Patients with hospital-acquired infections are predominantly hospitalized in different types of intensive care units (ICUs).

Touch surfaces commonly found in hospital rooms, such as bed rails, call buttons, touch plates, chairs, door handles, light switches, grab rails, intravenous poles, dispensers (alcohol gel, paper towel, soap), dressing trolleys, and counter and table tops are known to be contaminated with &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (one of the most virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) and vancomycin-resistant &quot;Enterococcus&quot;. Objects in closest proximity to patients have the highest levels of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and vancomycin-resistant &quot;Enterococcus&quot;. This is why touch surfaces in hospital rooms can serve as sources, or reservoirs, for the spread of bacteria from the hands of healthcare workers and visitors to patients.

A number of compounds can decrease the risk of bacteria growing on surfaces including: copper, silver, and germicides.

There have been a number of studies evaluating the use of no-touch cleaning systems particularly the use of ultraviolet C devices. One review was inconclusive due to lack of, or of poor quality evidence. Other reviews have found some evidence, and growing evidence of their effectiveness.

==Treatment==
Two of the bacteria species most likely to infect patients are the Gram-positive strains of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and Gram-negative &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot;. While antibiotic drugs to treat diseases caused by methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; are available, few effective drugs are available for &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;. &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; bacteria are evolving and becoming immune to antibiotics, so in many cases, polymyxin-type antibacterials need to be used. &quot;In many respects it&#x27;s far worse than MRSA&quot;, said a specialist at Case Western Reserve University.

Another growing disease, especially prevalent in New York City hospitals, is the drug-resistant, Gram-negative &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;. An estimated more than 20% of the &quot;Klebsiella&quot; infections in Brooklyn hospitals &quot;are now resistant to virtually all modern antibiotics, and those supergerms are now spreading worldwide.&quot;

The bacteria, classified as Gram-negative because of their color on the Gram stain, can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and other parts of the body. Their cell structures make them more difficult to attack with antibiotics than Gram-positive organisms like methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. In some cases, antibiotic resistance is spreading to Gram-negative bacteria that can infect people outside the hospital. &quot;For gram-positives we need better drugs; for gram-negatives we need any drugs&quot;, said Brad Spellberg, an infectious-disease specialist at Harbor–UCLA Medical Center, and the author of &quot;Rising Plague&quot;, a book about drug-resistant pathogens.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the second most common nosocomial infection and accounts for approximately one-fourth of all infections in the intensive care unit (ICU). HAP, or nosocomial pneumonia, is a lower respiratory infection that was not incubating at the time of hospital admission and that presents clinically two or more days after hospitalization. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as HAP in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The incidence of VAP is 10–30% among patients who require mechanical ventilation for &gt;48 h. A standard treatment protocol is based on accurate diagnosis definitions, microbiological confirmation of VAP, and the administration of imipenem plus ciprofloxacin as initial empirical antibiotic treatment.

One-third of nosocomial infections are considered preventable. The CDC estimates 687,000 people in the United States were infected by hospital-acquired infections in 2015, resulting in 72,000 deaths. The most common nosocomial infections are of the urinary tract, surgical site and various pneumonias.

An alternative treatment targeting localised infections is the use of irradiation by ultraviolet C.

==Epidemiology==
The methods used differ from country to country (definitions used, type of nosocomial infections covered, health units surveyed, inclusion or exclusion of imported infections, etc.), so the international comparisons of nosocomial infection rates should be made with the utmost care.

===Belgium===
In Belgium, the prevalence of nosocomial infections is about 6.2%. Annually about 125,500 patients become infected by a nosocomial infection, resulting in almost 3000 deaths. The extra costs for the health insurance are estimated to be approximately €400 million/year.

===France===
Estimates ranged from 6.7% in 1990 to 7.4% (patients may have several infections). At national level, prevalence among patients in health care facilities was 6.7% in 1996, 5.9% in 2001 and 5.0% in 2006. The rates for nosocomial infections were 7.6% in 1996, 6.4% in 2001 and 5.4% in 2006.

In 2006, the most common infection sites were urinary tract infections (30.3%), pneumopathy (14.7%), infections of surgery site (14.2%). Infections of the skin and mucous membrane (10.2%), other respiratory infections (6.8%) and bacterial infections / blood poisoning (6.4%). The rates among adult patients in intensive care were 13.5% in 2004, 14.6% in 2005, 14.1% in 2006 and 14.4% in 2007.

Nosocomial infections are estimated to make patients stay in the hospital for four to five additional days. Around 2004–2005, about 9,000 people died each year with a nosocomial infection, of which about 4,200 would have survived without this infection.

===Finland===
Rate was estimated at 8.5% of patients in 2005.

===Italy===
Since 2000, estimates show about a 6.7% infection rate, i.e. between and patients, which caused between and deaths. A survey in Lombardy gave a rate of 4.9% of patients in 2000.

===Switzerland===
Estimates range between 2 and 14%. A national survey gave a rate of 7.2% in 2004.

===United Kingdom===
In 2012, the Health Protection Agency reported the prevalence rate of hospital-acquired infections in England was 6.4% in 2011, against a rate of 8.2% in 2006, with respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical site infections the most common types of infections reported. In 2018, it was reported that in-hospital infections had risen from 5,972 in 2008 to 48,815 in 2017.

===United States===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated roughly 1.7 million hospital-associated infections, from all types of bacteria combined, cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year. Other estimates indicate 10%, or 2 million, patients a year become infected, with the annual cost ranging from $4.5 billion to $11 billion. In the US, the most frequent type of hospital infection is urinary tract infection (36%), followed by surgical site infection (20%), and bloodstream infection and pneumonia (both 11%).

==History==
In 1841, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician was working at a Vienna maternity hospital. He was &quot;shocked&quot; by the death rate of women who developed puerperal fever. He documented that mortality was three times higher in the ward where the medical students were delivering babies than in the next ward that was staffed by midwifery students. The medical students were also routinely working with cadavers. He compared the rates of infection with a similar hospital in Dublin, Ireland, and hypothesized that it was the medical students who somehow were infecting the women after labor. He instituted mandatory hand-washing in May 1847 and infection rates dropped dramatically. Louis Pasteur proposed the germ theory of disease and began his work on cholera in 1865 by identifying that it was microorganisms that were associated with disease.

<text>Flamborough is a community in the city of Hamilton in the Canadian province of Ontario. Prior to its amalgamation in 2001, Flamborough comprised the former townships of East Flamborough, West Flamborough, and Beverly, as well as the village of Waterdown. The largest suburban community is the former village of Waterdown, containing one third of the population. Other Flamborough communities include Carlisle, Christie&#x27;s Corners, Clappison&#x27;s Corners, Copetown, Freelton, Greensville, Lynden, Kirkwall, Millgrove, Mountsberg, Orkney, Peters Corners, Rockton, Troy, Sheffield, Valens, Strabane and Westover.

== History ==
The escarpment was originally covered with indigenous trails; two are now known as Snake Road (linking this area to the important waterway at Burlington Bay) and King Road (linking the area to the Burlington shoreline). The First Nations settlement of Tinawatawa is said to have been located near Westover, but some sources place it closer to Brantford. Lake Medad, located to the east of Waterdown, was a sacred meeting place for the area’s indigenous peoples—numerous accounts and stories attest to this.

The Chonnonton Nation lived in the area until they were displaced by the Haudenosaunee during the Beaver Wars of the 17th century (archaeological remains of the Chonnonton have been preserved in Waterdown&#x27;s Souharissen Natural Area.) The first recorded European to visit the area was when the French explorers La Salle and Joliet met near Tinawatawa, now Westover on September 24, 1669. When New France was conquered by in 1760, the territory fell under the protection of the British Crown. With the Treaty of Niagara establishing peace with France&#x27;s Indigenous allies, English settlers began to appear in the area.

After the American Revolution in 1783 and the creation of Upper Canada, Treaty No. 3 was established between the Crown and Mississauga Nation in 1792. Soon after, land at the western end of Lake Ontario was surveyed and organized into townships, which included East Flamborough, West Flamborough and Beverly. Governor&#x27;s Road (also known as Queen&#x27;s Highway 99 and later Regional Roads 399 and 299) was built on the border with neighbouring Ancaster Township in 1794–95, linking York (later Toronto) and London.

East Flamborough almost had a much different identity. Following the bloody collapse of the Bourbon Monarchy during the 1789-99 French Revolution, several thousand members of the French nobility sought refuge in London, England. The English were quick to move these refugees out of their capital, and jumped at the suggestion to have them settled in Canada. The township of East Flamborough was set aside (far away from the French settlers of Lower Canada) for L’Abbe Philippe Jean Louis des Jardins and Le Chevalier Lecorne. Before settlement could begin, however, France experienced a counter-revolution (leading to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte) that allowed the nobility to return. Had East Flamborough become a haven for the members of France’s outcast upper class the story of this area would have been radically different.

Perhaps the most dramatic event in Flamborough’s modern history occurred during the War of 1812, when over 2,000 Indigenous refugees arrived in the fall of 1813. Following the British defeat in the Battle of Moraviantown, all of southwestern Ontario was exposed to the ravages of the American army, and all the Indigenous People and settlers who could, fled to safety in the shadow of the British army at Burlington Heights. These refugees included the surviving warriors and families of Tecumseh’s Confederacy, Delawares who had escaped the destruction of their village on the Thames, and many from the Six Nations of the Grand River who feared they might meet a similar fate. The refugees filled the lower concessions of East and West Flamborough, stretching from Dundas to Burlington. Among the refugees were Tecumseh’s sister and successor, Tecumpease, and his brother Tenkswatawa, also known as the Prophet. Here they spent a dreadful winter, many suffering from disease and malnutrition. The landscape was stripped bare to feed them, and the Indian Department struggled to keep them supplied with the necessities of life. Many of the refugees stayed in Flamborough for nearly two years, huddled in their wigwams, struggling to survive. The last of the refugees only left when news of the peace arrived in the spring of 1815. Overall, the War of 1812 was a disaster for the Anishinaabe in this area. Despite their losses fighting for the British Crown, they gained nothing for their service.

In 1816, among fears that the Burlington Heights community would not survive another winter, Kahkewaquonaby went to live on his father’s farm in Stoney Creek. Two years later, the Credit River Mississauga sold their 648,000 acre inland tract of land. The tribe, described as &quot;thin and miserable&quot; had no choice: they needed the proceeds from the sale in order to survive. Another two years later, in 1820, they sold their reserves around the mouths of Bronte Creek, Oakville Creek, and the Credit River, leaving the Credit River Mississauga nothing more than 200 acres of land on the east side of their namesake river. The entire Nation now had less land than many contemporary pioneering families.

The three townships and Waterdown were founding constituents of Wentworth County in 1816. Waterdown was created in 1879 from that part of East Flamborough above the Niagara Escarpment and within approximately a kilometre of King&#x27;s Highway No. 5. The town of Dundas was created from parts of West Flamborough and Ancaster Townships.
In 1974, Flamborough Township was created by amalgamating the townships of East Flamborough, West Flamborough and Beverly with the village of Waterdown. At the same time, a small portion of Beverly Township near the community of Clyde was ceded to North Dumfries Township and a more populous but smaller portion of East Flamborough near the community of Aldershot was ceded to Burlington. Flamborough became a town in 1985.

In 2001, the provincial government amalgamated Flamborough with Ancaster, Dundas, Glanbrook, and Stoney Creek into the enlarged City of Hamilton.

The amalgamation was bitterly and unsuccessfully protested by some Flamborough residents and those of adjacent communities, particularly since the incumbent Progressive Conservative MPP, Toni Skarica&#x27;s government had promised in the previous election that the amalgamation would not occur. Skarica resigned in protest, but the amalgamation was not rescinded.

The population of Flamborough at the 2001 census was 37,796. By the 2006 census, its population had increased to 39,220.

== Flag and Coat of Arms ==
On September 14, 2009, the Flamborough Heritage Society formally petitioned Claire Boudreau, Chief Herald of Canada, for a grant of arms which would &quot;. . . reflect the former Town of Flamborough and its rich heritage so that we can better educate residents in the region.&quot; The Chief Herald accepted the petition and assigned Dr. Forrest Pass, Saguenay Herald, to the file.

That fall, the Flamborough Heritage Society created the &quot;Grant of Arms Committee&quot; to work with Dr. Pass to create a suitable design for the community.
The first meeting of the Grant of Arms Committee was held on January 2, 2010, in the &quot;Kirk Room&quot; of the Royal Coachman in Waterdown. At this initial meeting four key themes were identified by the committee for representation in the arms and flag: Trees, Water, People and Growth.

Throughout 2010 and 2011 meetings were held across Flamborough in an effort to be as inclusive as possible. Thanks to a partnership with the Flamborough Review, numerous articles were published encouraging people to offer their suggestions to the committee. All schools in Flamborough were encouraged to have their students participate in a contest to create a motto for Flamborough (ultimately created by committee member Kyle Menegaldo after combining submissions from Greensville Public School and Rehoboth Christian School).

The Flamborough Grant of Arms was published in the Canada Gazette (Vol. 145, No. 46) on November 12, 2011. Since early 2016, the original Grant of Arms presented at the Carlisle Golf &amp; Country Club has hung in the Flamborough Archives in the Waterdown Branch of the Hamilton Public Library.

The newsletter of The Waterdown East Flamborough Heritage Society explained in its April 2011 edition:

Arms and flags have a long history in this country, and are important tools used to project identity. Often a community&#x27;s flag and coat of arms are residents&#x27; only reminders of their area&#x27;s rich history. It was with this idea in mind that a grant of arms committee was struck by the WEFHS in 2009.

 members from every corner of the historic Flamborough-Beverly region, the committee worked closely with the Canadian Heraldic Authority (and in particular Dr. Forrest Pass, the Herald assigned to the file) to create a symbol that reflected our unique corner of the world, including both its human and natural aspects. After their first gathering in the Dart Room of the Royal Coachman, meetings were held in Rockton, Greensville, Waterdown, Carlisle, Clappisons Corners, Strabane, and Clyde as various symbols were hotly debated. Historic township seals were consulted, as well as previous symbols of the Town of Flamborough. In creating a motto for the community, every school in the area (over 20) were consulted and students were asked to send in their suggestions. 

On May 10, 2011, the Flamborough flag was raised over Waterdown District High School in the presence of its student body, as well as a delegation from Allan A. Greenleaf Public School.

== Geography and natural attractions ==
Much of Flamborough is located on top of the Niagara Escarpment; thus the Bruce Trail passes through the area. Although relatively flat in the south, a slow but steady incline is observable until reaching the Wellington County line which is the approximate height of land dividing two watersheds. The Beverly Swamp, located in the western part of the former Beverly Township, is another important physiographic area.

Natural attractions operated by the Hamilton Conservation Authority include:
* Westfield Heritage Centre, a living history museum containing pioneer era buildings moved from other locations across Ontario
* Valens Conservation Area, offering camping and boating at its reservoir
* Christie Lake, swimming and stocked fishing at its reservoir
* Spencer Gorge Conservation Area, with views of the falls and city below while hiking on the Bruce Trail.

=== Waterdown&#x27;s Souharissen Natural Area ===
On August 21, 2014, the Souharissen Natural Area was dedicated in Waterdown by the Honourable David C. Onley, 28th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, and Chief Bryan Laforme and Council of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation. Over 50 people attended the dedication including David Sweet MP, Councillor Judi Partridge, Carolyn King, United Empire Loyalists, and other members of the Mississaugas of the New Credit. The day began with the lighting of the first sacred fire in over two centuries, signalling the formal return of the Mississaugas to their traditional territory.

The Souharissen Natural Area covers 27 acres in the Village of Waterdown, and is the result of years of work following the discovery of 104 Indigenous archeological sites in the Waterdown Bay Development Area in 2005.

Along with the Aboriginal sites, the foundations of an early 19th-century dwelling were uncovered in the area. This dwelling may have been used by the first European settlers of Waterdown, Alexander Brown and Merren Grierson. The Natural Area includes a plaque identifying this important landmark, as well as detailing the histories of Merren Grierson and Alexander Brown, that was unveiled by the Lieutenant Governor, Chief LaForme and researcher Kekoa Reinebold.

Later that day a community feast was held in Waterdown at a local residence in honour of the return of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation to Flamborough, as well as the visit by both the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and Chief of the Mississaugas of the New Credit. Everyone who was part of the dedication, including the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Laforme attended.

== Economy and commercial attractions ==
After early European settlers had cleared the land of pine and oak forests, they began subsistence and then export farming. Disregarding the swamp and the excessively rocky areas of the Mountsberg area, the land is devoted chiefly to agriculture. Much of the arable land is devoted to raising corn, strawberries and cash crops.

In recent decades, Flamborough has become home to commuters and hobby farmers in the Golden Horseshoe. It has easy access to secondary highways, especially with the opening of an interchange with Highway 403 at Waterdown Road, granting easier access for traffic to/from Toronto.

Notable attractions operated as commercial enterprises include:
* African Lion Safari, with land mammals and birds of prey in an open air zoo
* Flamboro Downs, featuring harness racing, and slot machines
* Flamboro Speedway, featuring car racing
* Rockton Airport, a privately-owned Sailplane aerodrome, offering flight training and visitor rides.
* Rockton World&#x27;s Fair, an agricultural exhibition held every Thanksgiving Weekend (Canadian)

== Local Media ==
The Flamborough Review is a community newspaper published every Thursday by Metroland Media. Metroland acquired the Review in 2003.

<text>MOD Boddington is an installation of Defence Digital (formerly Information Systems &amp; Services), an operating cluster of the Ministry of Defence. It was formerly RAF Boddington, a non-flying Royal Air Force station located in Boddington, Gloucestershire, England, and was the former home of No. 9 Signals Unit RAF.

Boddington was the first computerised communication centre in the 1950s when it was run by the British Army. The tradition of computerised relay communications has continued to the present day.

==History==
The station was established in 1940 as an army telephone exchange operated by the Auxiliary Territorial Service under the guard of the Gloucestershire Regiment. It was later controlled by the Royal Corps of Signals before passing to the Royal Air Force.

On 1 October 1978 RAF Boddington became No. 9 Signals Unit (No. 9 SU), an independent Unit under the control of RAF Support Command Signals Headquarters (SCSHQ), with functional control of their respective networks by Controller Defence Communications Network (&quot;CDCN&quot;) and Headquarters RAF Strike Command (HQSTC).

In 1998 operational command of Boddington transferred to the newly formed Defence Communication Services Agency (DCSA), with the unit becoming known as DCSA 9 SU Boddington. The unit was subsequently chosen as the Primary Message Agent site for the United Kingdom as part of the Automated Messaging Systems Communications Equipment Replacement Programme (AMSCERP) which provided secure messaging services for the RAF and British Army.

The facility was upgraded in 2006 during which time temporary buildings were used to accommodate IT equipment.

== Post RAF use ==
Although the site ceased to be an RAF station in December 2007, it was retained by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) as a communications station. The site was then known as ISS Boddington, having initially been operated by the Defence Communication Services Agency (DCSA) then Information Systems and Services (ISS), and since 2019 Defence Digital transitioning to the name MOD Boddington.

<doc id="875897" wikidata="Q171577" url="?curid=875897" title="Justin Wilson (racing driver)">
<text>Justin Boyd Wilson (31 July 1978 – 24 August 2015) was a British professional open-wheel racing driver who competed in Formula One (F1) in , the Champ Car World Series (CCWS) from 2004 to 2007 and the IndyCar Series from 2008 to 2015. He won the first Formula Palmer Audi (FPA) in 1998, the International Formula 3000 Championship (IF3000) with Nordic Racing in 2001, and co-won the 2012 24 Hours of Daytona for Michael Shank Racing.

Wilson began karting at the age of eight and achieved consistent results, before progressing to car racing in the Formula Vauxhall Championship. He won the FPA title and earned a fully funded seat in IF3000, becoming the first British driver to win the series championship in 2001. He moved to the 2002 World Series by Nissan for the Racing Engineering team and finished fourth. Through an investment scheme where the public could purchase shares in Wilson, he drove for the Minardi and Jaguar teams in the 2003 F1 season.

He drove for the Conquest Racing and RuSPORT teams in the CCWS from 2004 to 2007, winning four races and finishing runner-up in the 2006 and 2007 drivers&#x27; championships. Wilson went to Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing for the 2008 IndyCar Series, winning the Detroit Indy Grand Prix. A move to the low-budget Dale Coyne Racing (DCR) team for 2009 resulted in the team&#x27;s first open-wheel victory at the Grand Prix at the Glen. Wilson moved to the Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing squad from 2010 and 2011 but did not win a race. He returned to DCR for 2012 to 2014, winning the 2012 Firestone 550 and finishing sixth in the 2013 drivers&#x27; championship.

Late in the 2015 season, in the ABC Supply 500 at Pocono Raceway, Wilson died after debris from a crashed car struck his helmet. He was the first driver to die from injuries sustained in an IndyCar race since Dan Wheldon in 2011. , it is also the most recent fatal accident to have occurred in IndyCar. His organs were donated to save the lives of five people. A hairpin corner at Snetterton Circuit was renamed after him and a memorial fund was established to support his children.

==Early and personal life==
Wilson was born in Moorgate, a suburb of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on 31 July 1978 to Keith and Lynne Wilson. His father owns a solvents company, a petrol station, and raced Formula Ford cars from the 1960s until a major accident at Oulton Park in 1975 ended his career. Wilson&#x27;s younger brother, Stefan, is also a racing driver. He grew up in Woodall, South Yorkshire. From 1989 to the completion of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations in July 1994, Wilson was educated at Sheffield&#x27;s private Birkdale School.

At age 11, he was tested for dyslexia, a learning disability that affects how a person reads and writes words; the test was negative. Wilson&#x27;s mother took him to a clinic for a second test two years later and he was formally diagnosed with the condition at the age of 13. He struggled at school with the disability and received additional tutoring; Wilson&#x27;s peers perceived him as inept and unintelligent. He married his partner Julia in 2006 and they have two children, Jane and Jessica. Wilson was the official ambassador for the International Dyslexia Association, and Teen Cancer America.

==Junior career==
Aged 8 in 1987, Wilson sought a hobby and took up karting, refining his ability at the South Yorkshire Kart Club in Wombwell, Barnsley. His father was his chief mechanic, courier and mentor. In 1989, Wilson finished 7th in the Cadet National British Karting Championship, 12th in the 1991 RACMSA Junior British Championships, improving to 4th in 1992. His father contacted karting expert Terry Fullerton in 1993 and the two met at the Worksop motorway services. Fullerton told him Wilson should cease karting in his category because of his weight, and mentored him in 1994. Wilson finished fifth in the 1994 Formula A British Championship, the United Kingdom&#x27;s highest-level of kart racing. He was third at Buckmore Park Kart Circuit&#x27;s Renault GP race.

He progressed to car racing at age 16, competing in the Formula Vauxhall Junior Winter Series with Team JLR, as preparation for the 1995 Formula Vaxuhall Junior Championship. Wilson won on his series debut at Pembrey Circuit in South Wales&#x27; first heat aged 16 years and 2 months, and became the first 16-year-old to win an official motor race in the United Kingdom. He remained with Team JLR in 1995. Wilson missed the season&#x27;s first round after breaking both his legs when the brakes on his racing school car failed at Brands Hatch. A pre-season title favourite, he claimed four victories and tied on points in third position with driver Ben Collins. He won the Formula Vauxhall Junior Challenge Cup category limited to 16-year-olds. Wilson won the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC) Chris Bristow Trophy as &quot;the most promising driver to race at Silverstone&quot;, and was a finalist for the Autosport BRDC Award.

To better his driving ability, Paul Stewart Racing (PSR) manager Andy Pycock selected him to compete for the team in the 1996 championship. PSR were allowed to move his pedals back and alter its shape for better comfort to accommodate Wilson&#x27;s frame. He won the season-opening round at Brands Hatch, finished in the top five in every race and took two pole positions to finish runner-up in the championship. The following year, Wilson fell to fourth overall with three victories and seven podium finishes. For the 1997 EFDA Nations Cup at Donington Park in October, he joined fellow driver Warren Carway at the Diamond Racing-run European Union Team, finishing fourth.

His performances impressed the three-time world champion Jackie Stewart and his son Paul. Jackie Stewart concluded Wilson&#x27;s height would hinder him in single-seaters and advised a move to either sports car or touring car racing. A lack of funding prevented a progression to Formula Three due to its high entry fee. His family wrote to the former driver and commentator Jonathan Palmer for advice. Palmer replied he had established a one-make racing series for drivers seeking a modest financial route to Formula One (F1). Wilson entered Formula Palmer Audi in 1998 and was employed as a driving instructor at Bedford Autodrome. With nine victories and four pole positions, he won the inaugural championship over Darren Turner, and was again shortlisted for the Autosport BRDC Award.

Wilson&#x27;s title victory earned him a fully funded seat in the International Formula 3000 Championship (IF3000)—F1&#x27;s feeder series—with Team Astromega for the 1999 season, and Palmer became his manager. He worked to better his engineering skills and relationship with the media. During the season, in which Palmer obtained sponsorship for Wilson from Benetton Formula, he qualified for every race and was several times the highest-placed rookie. He took two points and was 20th in the drivers&#x27; standings.

His driving ability attracted Nordic Racing&#x27;s attention, and they signed him for the 2000 season. He established a rapport with team owners Chris and Derek Mower, and results improved from 1999, finishing fifth overall with two podiums and five points finishes. He returned to Nordic Racing for the 2001 season, after negotiations with Arden International in late 2000 fell through because of his tall height. Wilson won three times—at Autódromo José Carlos Pace, the A1-Ring and the Hungaroring— and achieving 10 podium finishes and scoring 71 points, to become the first British driver to claim the championship. Wilson won by a series-record 32 points over Mark Webber, and the BRDC Gold Medal, the ERA Club Trophy and the Graham Hill Trophy for winning the title.

At first F1 teams were not interested in Wilson, but tested for the Jordan squad at Silverstone in September 2001, and had a seat fitting at McLaren. Jordan did not employ Wilson to race in the 2002 season due to financial issues, signing the 2001 British Formula Three champion Takuma Sato. Wilson considered going to Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), and spoke to the Minardi team before it selected Webber; he did not return to IF3000. For 2002, he drove in the inaugural World Series by Nissan. The Racing Engineering team chose Wilson, and he accepted. He won races at Autódromo José Carlos Pace and the Circuit Ricardo Tormo and achieved six more podium finishes for fourth in the points standings.

==Formula One career==

When Minardi driver Alex Yoong was rested for two races due to poor performance, Wilson was the team&#x27;s preferred choice to replace him. However, during a seat fitting at Minardi&#x27;s headquarters in Faenza, Italy, he was unable to fit inside the PS02 car because of his long legs and so Anthony Davidson drove the car instead. Wilson and his manager Jonathan Palmer were eager to arrange a test with the Newman/Haas Racing CART team in September 2002, and Wilson had a seat fitting in a Lola-Toyota car at their Chicago workshop, becoming acquainted with staff members. Wilson made his oval track test debut at Homestead–Miami Speedway on 8 October. He declined Newman/Haas&#x27; invitation for a second test at Sebring International Raceway in December.

Wilson discussed driving for Minardi in with its owner Paul Stoddart, who was keen to have him replace the outgoing Mark Webber. He was told to gather £2 million in sponsorship funding to race for Minardi. The capital was raised through Palmer searching for financial partners, whilst Wilson&#x27;s father mortgaged the family home. With the provision of him bringing the agreed financial settlement, Minardi designed the PS03 car to accommodate Wilson&#x27;s large frame; the seat was lowered to keep his knees away from his chin and moved its pedals forward. He visited Faenza in late November and had no difficulty entering and exiting a mocked-up version of the car. Wilson signed a three-year driving contract with Minardi a month later.

It emerged Wilson had not obtained the necessary sponsorship money to pay for his seat at Minardi and his father was close to selling his petrol station. Palmer spent most of January and February 2003 holding meetings with lawyers to develop a programme allowing investors to support Wilson&#x27;s career by buying shares in him. This would allow them to raise £1.2 million required for Wilson to drive for Minardi in the season&#x27;s first two rounds. The investment was floated on the London Stock Exchange from 5 March to 31 May, making Wilson the first racing driver to be listed on it. A total of 900 people invested a minimum of £500, with 10 per cent of Wilson&#x27;s earnings paid to them until 31 December 2012.

He equalled the pace of his more experienced teammate Jos Verstappen; Wilson generally qualified in a low grid slot and made brisk starts to gain track position before a pit stop. Before the , Jaguar selected him to replace the under-performing Antônio Pizzonia for the rest of the season. David Pitchforth, Jaguar&#x27;s managing director, and team principal Tony Purnell were impressed with Wilson&#x27;s performances and driving; they received feedback from Stoddart and Wilson&#x27;s mechanics at Nordic Racing. Palmer told Wilson to visit Jaguar&#x27;s headquarters in Milton Keynes for a seat fitting at midnight with a contract written up the day after the . Having been granted the final five races to convince Jaguar to keep him alongside Webber for , Wilson found the Jaguar different to handle than his Minardi and did not foresee the change in driving style required to use it. His teammate outperformed him by half a second on average in his first four races with the team due to his unfamiliarity with the car, but was consistently within three to four-tenths of a second per lap of Webber&#x27;s pace by the end of the season. Wilson finished eighth at the and was 20th in the drivers&#x27; standings with one point.

He was linked to three teams for the 2004 season. Jaguar granted Wilson a contract extension until post-season testing ended in December to convince the team to retain him. Jaguar dropped Wilson because its owner, Ford, was not prepared to pour unlimited funds into F1 and advised the team to sign a pay driver. Christian Klien, a Formula Three driver funded by the drink company Red Bull, replaced Wilson. A return to Jaguar as a test driver on race weekends became unfeasible after F1&#x27;s governing body – the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) – retained a regulation for 2004 prohibiting drivers who had competed in six or more F1 events from participating in Friday test sessions.

==American open-wheel racing career==
===Champ Car World Series (2004–2007)===

With the loss of employment in F1, Wilson was disenchanted with his career, and sought a drive in the U.S.-based Champ Car World Series (CCWS) over the rival Indy Racing League (IRL) due to its parity, noting: &quot;Same cars, same engines, so working with the team with a half reasonable budget you can do a half decent job.&quot; Wilson signed with the small-budget Conquest Racing team for the 2004 season. The layout of his Lola car allowed him to lie almost flat on its floor and demonstrated a decent performance in pre-season testing. Wilson had a mixed season driving the 34 car; he took eight top-ten finishes, with a year-best of fourth at the season-ending Gran Premio Telmex/Tecate. He generally qualified higher than he finished, taking a season-high of second at the Champ Car Grand Prix of Portland. Wilson finished 11th in the drivers&#x27; standings with 188 points, and was second to A. J. Allmendinger in the rookie of the year standings.

After the season, Wilson declared his wish to remain in the CCWS for the 2005 season and enquired several teams about employment. Car owner Carl Russo signed him to replace Michel Jourdain Jr. at the RuSPORT team in November 2004. Wilson worked with driver coach Barry Waddell, and cautioned his rivals he was ready to win races due to further car and driver development. In the No. 9 Lola-Ford car, Wilson took three fourth-place finishes in the first three rounds before earning his first series pole position at the Champ Car Grand Prix of Portland. He led the final ten laps of the Molson Indy Toronto to claim his first series victory. Wilson followed that victory with four more top-ten finishes, and ended the season with a second career win at the Gran Premio Telmex/Tecate from pole position. He amassed 265 points to finish third in the drivers&#x27; championship; his qualifying results improved with nine top fives.

Wilson remained with RuSPORT for the 2006 season. Several pundits predicted he would challenge for the drivers&#x27; championship, and he said his objective was to be consistent and win two or three races. He took four-second-place finishes in the first five rounds. At the season&#x27;s sixth race, the Molson Grand Prix of Toronto, Wilson won his only pole position that year. At the following West Edmonton Mall Grand Prix of Edmonton he qualified in third place and achieved his only victory of 2006. Wilson took a further three top-eight finishes. He fractured the scaphoid bone in his right wrist in an accident in practice for the Lexmark Indy 300, requiring him to withdraw from the race; he was deemed fit by the CCWS medical delegate Chris Pinderski to enter the season-ending Gran Premio Telmex. He qualified on pole position, and led until Sébastien Bourdais passed him on the final lap. Wilson finished runner-up in the championship with 298 points, and won that year&#x27;s Greg Moore Legacy Award.

The Newman/Haas, Forsythe and RuSPORT teams were interested in Wilson for the 2007 season. He signed a &quot;multi-year&quot; contract with RuSPORT in January 2007. Wilson was persuaded to remain there after his race engineer Todd Malloy left and limitations in the team&#x27;s budget saw his assistant Mike Talbott promoted. Driving the No. 9 Panoz DP01-Cosworth XFE he achieved eight top-ten finishes and two pole positions at the Champ Car Grand Prix of Portland and the San Jose Grand Prix at Redback Raceway after ten rounds. Wilson led most of the Bavaria Champ Car Grand Prix for his solitary victory of the season. He ended his CCWS career with consecutive top-ten finishes in the final two rounds to be runner-up in the drivers&#x27; championship with 281 points. Wilson won the Greg Moore Legacy Award for the second successive year.

===IndyCar Series (2008–2015)===
Late in the season RuSPORT announced it was closing and informed Wilson and his colleagues. He was put on Newman/Haas&#x27; shortlist to replace the outgoing Bourdais for the 2008 season, and was rumoured to be in contention to drive for Andretti Green Racing and did not want to move to the American Le Mans Series. Wilson and Palmer agreed terms to join Newman/Haas in the CCWS before it amalgamated with the IRL to form the IndyCar Series. Wilson said his objective for the season was to perform to the best of his ability and acknowledged Newman/Haas would be disadvantaged against the established IndyCar teams on oval tracks noting: &quot;We can only judge the competition when we get there, but we have to be realistic. I don&#x27;t want to overestimate and I don&#x27;t want to underestimate.&quot;

While Wilson struggled during his rookie season driving the No. 2 Dallara-Honda car, he took pole position for the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, and rapidly established himself as a road course expert. He qualified 16th for his first Indianapolis 500. Mid-race, Wilson had an accident due to a loss of control at the rear of his car, which left him 27th. He was third at the Indy Edmonton and achieved his first series victory at the Detroit Indy Grand Prix three races later. Wilson was 11th in the drivers&#x27; championship with 340 points, and was second in the rookie of the year standings, behind Hideki Mutoh but ahead of Will Power.

Before the 2009 season Newman/Haas co-owner and actor Paul Newman died and the Great Recession cost the team much of its funding. In January 2009 Wilson was released from the team after being informed they could not support two paid drivers without acquiring additional sponsorship. The funded Robert Doornbos replaced him. He contacted Dale Coyne, the co-owner of the privately underfunded Dale Coyne Racing (DCR) team, in February, after a journalist told him DCR had employed engineer Bill Pappas. Wilson visited their workshop for a seat fitting, and became acquainted with Pappas. He signed a contract to drive for DCR one month later. At the season-opening Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, Wilson began from second and finished third. He qualified 15th for the Indianapolis 500; late in the race, Wilson retired following a collision with a barrier after 160 laps, placing 23rd. Wilson started second at the Grand Prix at the Glen and led for 49 out of 60 laps in DCR&#x27;s first open-wheel victory and his second in the series. With five more top-ten finishes over the rest of the year, he was ninth in the points standings with 354.

Wilson drove Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing&#x27;s (DRR) No. 22 car in the 2010 season. A disagreement over the length of his contract with DCR, the departure of key team personnel and a desire for another experience led him to assess driving elsewhere. Wilson received a telephone call from Dreyer &amp; Reinbold co-owners Robbie Buhl and Dennis Reinbold and visited their workshop in January 2010. He was impressed by what he observed and signed to the team soon after. Wilson mentored his teammate Mike Conway on oval track racing and advised DRR on road courses. In the first four races he finished second at the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg and the Grand Prix of Long Beach. After qualifying 11th for the Indianapolis 500, Wilson led eleven laps and took seventh. Four races later, he took his first IndyCar pole position for the Honda Indy Toronto. The rest of Wilson&#x27;s season saw him achieve a best of sixth at the Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma. He was 11th in the drivers&#x27; standings with 361 points.

Although linked with the Andretti Autosport, KV Racing Technology and Panther Racing teams for the 2011 season, Wilson stayed at DRR. An important factor in his decision was the progress he believed the team had made in 2010. Wilson sustained a minor fracture in his left wrist in an accident with Alex Tagliani at the season-opening Grand Prix of St. Petersburg and wore a carbon fibre brace. He started the Indianapolis 500 from 19th position. Handling and balance difficulties left Wilson in 16th. His best finish of 2011 was fifth at Edmonton Indy. During practice for the Honda Indy 200 an accident left him with a stable burst fracture of the T5 vertebrae in his back. Wilson was ruled unfit for three months and wore a back brace. For the rest of the season, his substitutes were Simon Pagenaud at Mid-Ohio, Tomas Scheckter at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Giorgio Pantano on the road and street courses and Townsend Bell in Kentucky and Las Vegas. Wilson was 24th in the points standings with 183.

For the 2012 season, he returned to drive for DCR in its No. 18 Dallara DW12-Honda car. Wilson had two tenth-place finishes in the first four races. At the Indianapolis 500, he qualified in 21st and finished 7th. At the Firestone 550 Wilson overtook Graham Rahal, who crashed with two laps to go, for his third career series victory and his first on an oval track. The rest of his season saw him claim two more top-ten results in the final eight races for 15th in the drivers&#x27; championship with 278 points.

Wilson remained at DCR for the 2013 season after signing a long-term contract; he changed his car number to 19. He began the year with three consecutive top-nine finishes. Wilson qualified for the Indianapolis 500 in 14th and finished a career-high fifth. His performance for the rest of 2013 included three podium finishes—two third places at the first Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix and the Grand Prix of Houston, and a season-high second at the Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma. At the season-ending IndyCar World Championships at the Auto Club Speedway, Wilson was involved in a high speed lateral impact with driver Tristan Vautier, sustaining a minor pulmonary contusion and three non-operable breakages to his pelvis. He was told to avoid bearing weight on his right leg before commencing rehabilitation. Wilson finished the season a series-high sixth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 472 points.

DCR owner Dale Coyne took up an option to retain Wilson for the 2014 season after recovering from injury and recommenced training. Michael Cannon became his race engineer after Bill Pappas moved to Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. Coyne promised Wilson better resources for him to continue achieving top-ten finishes. His first top ten-finish of 2014 was a sixth at the Indy Grand Prix of Alabama. Wilson started 14th at the Indianapolis 500 finishing eight places lower and two laps down in 22nd after debris damaged his front wing late in the race. One race later, Wilson achieved a season-best fourth at the Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix and four top-ten finishes in the final 12 rounds for 15th overall with 395 points.

He left DCR after the season ended because of their limited budget for a full-time campaign, and sought employment with another team for the 2015 season, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s one of those things, where I could find out tomorrow, or it could be in another month or two months.&quot; Talks with Andretti Autosport owner Michael Andretti, who was interested in Wilson, about a full-time campaign ended in March 2015 over sponsorship issues. That same month, Wilson signed a two-race contract to drive Andretti Autosport&#x27;s No. 25 car in May&#x27;s Grand Prix of Indianapolis and the Indianapolis 500. He started his final Indianapolis 500 from sixth position. During the race a tyre vibration and a pit stop strategy error left him in 21st. Afterwards, Wilson obtained sponsorship to drive the season&#x27;s final five races for Andretti, finishing a year-high second in the Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio, in an aerodynamically inefficient car.

==Other racing ventures==

Wilson made his sports car racing debut at the 2001 FIA GT Magny-Cours 500km, part of the FIA GT Championship. He shared the Coca-Cola Racing Team&#x27;s No. 65 Porsche 911 GT3-RS with Tomáš Enge, finishing third in the N-GT category. He joined fellow British drivers Ben Collins and Christian Vann in a Team Ascari-entered Ascari KZR-1 car in the LMP900 class at the 2002 12 Hours of Sebring (part of the American Le Mans Series), finishing sixth. Two years later, he again entered the season-opening 12 Hours of Sebring, this time joined by Milka Duno and Phil Andrews. Driving a Taurus Racing-fielded Lola B2K/10 they finished 9th in class and 22nd overall. In June, Wilson competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Tom Coronel and Ralph Firman in the No. 16 Racing for Holland Dome S101-Judd car, retiring after 313 laps with ignition failure.

At the 2006 24 Hours of Daytona (part of the Rolex Sports Car Series), Wilson drove for Michael Shank Racing (MSR) alongside A. J. Allmendinger, Oswaldo Negri Jr. and Mark Patterson in the No. 60 Riley MkXI-Lexus car in the Daytona Prototype (DP) category, completing 733 laps and finishing second. He entered the season-ending round of the 2007 Rolex Sports Car Series, the Sunchaser 1000, joining Negri and Patterson at MSR and finishing tenth. He returned to MSR for the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona with Negri, Patterson and Graham Rahal, driving the Riley Mk.XX-Ford DP vehicle and finishing sixth after starting from pole position.

In 2010, he entered the 24 Hours of Daytona for the third time, this time for Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates in the DP class. The No. 01 Riley Mk.XX-BMW car he shared with Max Papis, Scott Pruett and Memo Rojas finished second after starting fifth. Wilson returned to MSR with Curb/Agajanian for the 2011 24 Hours of Daytona, partnering Allmendinger and Michael McDowell, starting eighth and finishing seventh in the No. 6 Dallara DP01-Ford car. He won the 2012 24 Hours of Daytona with Allmendinger, Negri and John Pew at MSR, completing 761 laps in the No. 60 Riley-Ford DP car. He joined Kelly Racing as Greg Murphy&#x27;s international co-driver in its No. 51 Holden Commodore for the Gold Coast 600 double header round of the V8 Supercars Championship in October 2012. Wilson visited the team&#x27;s workshop for a seat fitting as preparation for the round. He and Murphy finished outside of the top ten in both races.

Wilson entered the 24 Hours of Daytona alongside Allmendinger, Marcos Ambrose, Negri and Pew at MSR in 2013, finishing third. He partnered Gustavo Yacamán in MSR&#x27;s No. 6 Riley-Ford car at the Six Hours at the Glen when regular driver Antônio Pizzonia had sponsorship problems, finishing sixth. With no date conflicts between the IndyCar Series and the Rolex Sports Car Series, Wilson entered the 2013 Rolex Sports Car Series&#x27; final four rounds to partner and mentor Yacamán. The duo had a season-best second-place finish at Lime Rock. At the 2014 24 Hours of Daytona (now part of the IMSA SportsCar Championship), Wilson, Allmendinger, Negri and Pew were 12th in the prototype class and 47th overall due to a gearbox fault in the No. 60 Riley-Ford Ecoboost car. He rejoined Negri and Pew at MSR for the following 12 Hours of Sebring, finishing ninth.

In 2015, Wilson replaced Matt McMurry as co-driver to Negri and Pew in MSR&#x27;s No. 60 Ligier JS P2-Honda car at the 12 Hours of Sebring, where they came 42nd. As Wilson waited for a new IndyCar Series contract, he was entered into the all-electric Formula E round in Moscow by Andretti Autosport in June. He replaced Scott Speed, who had an X Games commitment. Wilson finished 10th and scored 1 championship point for a 25th drivers standing finish. A planned drive in a HPD ARX-04b at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in June was cancelled because turbocharger failures damaged the car&#x27;s motors.

==Death==
On the 179th lap of the 2015 ABC Supply 500 at Pocono Raceway on 23 August, race leader Sage Karam lost control of his car in the first turn after passing a bump in the tarmac surface. He crashed heavily with the front of his car against a wall to the right of the circuit. The car&#x27;s nose cone was removed with enough force that it ricocheted along the racing surface as other drivers manoeuvred past it. James Jakes slowed faster than Wilson, who turned right to avoid contact with his car. At the same time, the nose cone from Karam&#x27;s car struck Wilson&#x27;s helmet as he drove through the accident scene. Wilson was knocked unconscious and his car almost immediately veered left out of control towards the inside wall. It left the track, hitting the left-hand side wall coupled with a SAFER barrier after the first turn and continued to slide before stopping.

Wilson was unresponsive when the track safety crew arrived at his vehicle and he had to be extricated from it. A medivac helicopter was called for and transported Wilson to Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest in nearby Allentown, Pennsylvania. He was reported to be in a coma with a severe head injury and listed in critical condition. Wilson was declared dead from his injuries the following day, at 17:37 local time on 24 August. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway president J. Douglas Boles and the CEO of Hulman &amp; Company Mark Miles made the news public at 21:00 that same day. He was the first driver to die from injuries sustained in a racing accident in IndyCar since Dan Wheldon was killed during the 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championships at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. An autopsy conducted by Andrew Kehm, the Chief Deputy Coroner of the Lehigh County Coroner&#x27;s Office, on 26 August determined Wilson died of blunt force trauma to his head. On 10 September, he was given a funeral service at St. James The Great Church in Paulerspury, Northamptonshire, England attended by about 500 mourners, which included members of the motor racing community. Wilson was subsequently cremated, and a wake was held for him at Silverstone Circuit.

An inquest into his death was held at Northampton General Hospital on the morning of 9 March 2016. The coroner concluded his death was &quot;accidental&quot;. A statement from Wilson&#x27;s father was read, which described the crash as a &quot;freak accident&quot; and stated:&quot;The car leading the race crashed and was driving at over . The driver was unhurt but debris from his car flew high into the air and a large, heavy piece hit Justin on the head as he approached the scene of the accident. Justin was unconscious, he was extracted from the car and rushed to hospital. He underwent surgery and was kept on a life support machine until the following day. The decision was then taken to switch off the machine and Justin was pronounced deceased.&quot;

==Personality and legacy==
David Tremayne of &quot;The Independent&quot; described Wilson as an &quot;easy-going and humble&quot; individual who was able to build a rapport with others. According to Alasdair Steven of &quot;The Herald&quot;: &quot;his cheerful, quietly modest manner, and genuine enthusiasm&quot; made him popular with fans of motor racing. A leader of the IndyCar safety and promotional association alongside Dario Franchitti and Tony Kanaan, Wilson increased his lobbying for improved safety after the death of Dan Wheldon in 2011. He aspired to have retention walls altered to better deal with airborne crashes, and wrote an online article arguing for the shifting of trackside grandstands to inside racing circuits as a means of shielding spectators from debris.

Nicknamed &quot;Bad Ass&quot; by his driving instructor colleagues at PalmerSport in 1999, for being &quot;as fearsome a competitor you could ever find&quot;, Wilson was friendly, shy, endearing, soft-spoken and highly analytical. His technical shrewdness provided teams with extensive performance alterations to improve a race car. According to &quot;Racer&quot;″s Mark Glendenning this made Wilson a driver who &quot;commanded universal respect&quot; from fellow competitors. For DailySportsCar editor Graham Goodwin it created an image of Wilson as &quot;a very rare breed indeed, a man in the modern age who had competed at the highest level in multiple motorsport disciplines&quot;, and a driver who &quot;had the cutting edge&quot;. Wilson was fast-witted and used this in his humour.

After Wilson&#x27;s death, the donation of his organs helped to save the lives of five people. On 27 August IndyCar drivers Marco Andretti, James Hinchcliffe, Josef Newgarden, Will Power and Graham Rahal converted what had been a previously planned promotion for the season-ending Grand Prix of Sonoma at Sonoma Raceway by driving their cars across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco into a tribute for Wilson. Andretti drove Wilson&#x27;s No. 25 car. Honda and Andretti Autosport employed Wilson&#x27;s close friend and fellow driver Oriol Servià to drive his car in Sonoma.

Joey Gase, a NASCAR Xfinity Series driver, carried a photograph of Wilson on the rear of his No. 52 car to promote awareness of eye, organ and tissue donation. A. J. Allmendinger had his former teammate Wilson&#x27;s name above the window of his vehicle for the final 12 rounds of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. At the 2016 Indianapolis 500, Stefan drove the No. 25 KV Racing Technology car in honour of his elder sibling. The name of a hairpin turn on the Snetterton Circuit&#x27;s 300 layout was changed from Montreal Corner to Wilson Corner by the track&#x27;s owners MotorSport Vision in July 2016; a board at the corner features the design of Wilson&#x27;s multi-coloured rainbow racing helmet and his surname.

The Wilson Children&#x27;s Fund was launched with the support of his widow Julia to ensure their two daughters would be financially secure in the long term following his death. Contributions are raised through the auctioning of motor racing memorabilia on the internet and by public donations.

<doc id="875898" wikidata="Q16997945" url="?curid=875898" title="Jump Start (comic strip)">
<text>Jump Start is a daily comic strip drawn by cartoonist Robb Armstrong. It portrays the trials and tribulations of a young African American couple as they try to balance the demands of work and raising their young children.

&quot;Jump Start&quot; is set in the Philadelphia area, where Armstrong grew up. The strip is syndicated by United Feature Syndicate.

== Publication history ==
Armstrong attended Syracuse University, where in 1982 he created a popular comic strip in the student newspaper &quot;The Daily Orange,&quot; called &quot;Hector&quot;. The strip ran for four years, and its main characters were two young men and a glasses-wearing dog.

After having no success in attempting to syndicate &quot;Hector&quot;, Armstrong then transitioned it into &quot;Jump Start&quot;, which was designed to have a broader appeal than the earlier strip. &quot;Jump Start&quot; entered syndication in 1989.

== Story and characters ==
&quot;Jump Start&quot;&#x27;s main characters are Joe and Marcy Cobb, and their children Sunny, Jojo and twins Tommi and Teddy. Police officer Joe&#x27;s uniform hat is drawn with a keystone badge emblem, as many police departments in Pennsylvania use that emblem due to Pennsylvania being known as the &quot;Keystone State&quot;.

Robb Armstrong set out to portray young black couples from his own experience. In Marcy and Joe, the reader sees an average middle class couple, busy with work and raising a family. Armstrong says, &quot;The image of young blacks is so skewed, so false. I don&#x27;t know anybody who&#x27;s carjacking, playing basketball, rapping. Joe and Marcy and the characters I&#x27;ve developed are deep and based on real life.&quot; In all strips, adults use regular all caps type for their speech and thoughts, while children&#x27;s speech and thought balloons are a mix of uppercase and lowercase lettering.

===The Cobb family===

* Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Cobb Sr. is a father, loving husband and hard-working city police officer.
* Marcy Cobb (née Hart) is a fun-loving, young and caring mother, a loving wife and a busy and dedicated nurse.
* Sunny Cobb is the upbeat, intelligent daughter of Joe and Marcy. She is addicted to macaroni and cheese. She is a good big sister to Jojo, Tommi and Teddy but still knows how to use that older-sibling power.
* Joseph &quot;Jojo&quot; Latimer Cobb Jr. is a budding leader with an active imagination. Jojo makes it his business to cause the havoc expected of little brothers. He even considers his group of friends to be his &quot;business partners&quot; and acts as almost a CEO figure among his friends. His pursuits include campaigning for class president and being in a band with his friends called &quot;Benny and the Jets&quot;, which he quit to go solo.
* Teddy &amp; Tommi Cobb are the youngest children, fraternal twins. Not yet capable of speech with other characters but they completely understand each other.
* Mortimer was the former pet of Ray Ramsey, while he was in prison. He was taken in by the Cobbs; Joe gave Mortimer back to Ray when he was released and went straight, though it was clear the children were already attached to him. And it was clear that Mortimer felt the same. The first day Ray brought him home, he got out and ran back home to the Cobb family. Ray would let him stay and be the Cobbs&#x27; family pet. Mortimer is very protective of his family and Joe believes he&#x27;s a good judge of character.

===Recurring characters===
*Dot Cobb is Joe&#x27;s mother. Despite living with a family of police officers, she is a dangerous driver to the point where she can frighten even the most fearless individuals. Dot is a former English teacher, and is an extreme stickler when it comes to grammar, correcting anyone she meets who utters even a single grammatical error, much to their annoyance.
*Frank Cobb is Joe&#x27;s father (referred to as &quot;Pop-Pop&quot; by his grandchildren). An ex-police officer, he now spends his time knowing everything about the comic strip &quot;Klondike Ike&quot; (perhaps based on the old Ozark Ike strip), but was reinstated as a police academy training officer. 
*Edmund Crunchy is Joe Cobb&#x27;s partner at the police department; despite the disparity in their ages, he and Joe get along and hang out outside of work. Grumpy and grouchy, he is nevertheless a good man and a dedicated police officer. He likes to appear to be hard boiled, but has a few soft spots, especially for his dog. Crunchy was Frank Cobb&#x27;s old police partner. He is married to Captain Yolanda Ruiz. His full name was revealed in the October 8, 2005 strip.
*Maureen is Marcy&#x27;s mother. A widow, she marries Clarence&#x27;s father. Clayton came into her life around the same time as Romaire, a person she dated many years ago who seemed to want to restart their relationship. 
*Benny is one of Jojo&#x27;s friends from school. He is a follower to Jojo and is also a key member of their band. At one time Benny worked for and reported directly to Jojo, and was often seem perusing documents and putting in long hours &quot;at the office.&quot;
*Clarence Glover is a good friend of Joe&#x27;s. He is an orthodontist and a very bulky man with eleven brothers. Since his father has married Marcy&#x27;s mother it makes him and Marcy step-siblings.
*Charlene Glover is Clarence&#x27;s Caucasian wife, an automotive mechanic with a penchant for restoration.
*Olivet Maxine Glover is Clarence&#x27;s and Charlene&#x27;s youngest child. She was named after Charlene&#x27;s late mother and she was born on her grandmother&#x27;s birthday. Like the twins, she can not speak, but her thoughts are often shown.
*C. J. Glover who calls himself O&#x27;Sullivan is Clarence and Charlene&#x27;s teenage son.
*Jasmine Glover is Clarence and Charlene&#x27;s second child and first daughter.

<text>A body of water or waterbody is any significant accumulation of water on the surface of Earth or another planet. The term most often refers to oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

Most are naturally occurring geographical features, but some are artificial. There are types that can be either. For example, most reservoirs are created by engineering dams, but some natural lakes are used as reservoirs. Similarly, most harbors are naturally occurring bays, but some harbors have been created through construction.

Bodies of water that are navigable are known as waterways. Some bodies of water collect and move water, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as lakes and oceans.

Bodies of water are affected by gravity, which is what creates the tidal effects. The impact of climate change on water is likely to intensify as observed through the rising sea levels, water acidification and flooding. This means that climate change has pressure on water bodies.

Climate change significantly affects bodies of water through rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and sea-level rise. Warmer temperatures lead to the melting of glaciers and polar ice, contributing to rising sea levels and affecting coastal ecosystems. Freshwater bodies, such as rivers and lakes, are experiencing more frequent droughts, affecting water availability for communities and biodiversity. Moreover, ocean acidification, caused by increased carbon dioxide absorption, threatens marine ecosystems like coral reefs. Collaborative global efforts are needed to mitigate these impacts through sustainable water management practices.

== Types ==
Bodies of water can be categorized into:
# Rain water
# Surface water
# Underground water

There are some geographical features involving water that are not bodies of water, for example, waterfalls, geysers and rapids.

<doc id="875903" wikidata="Q152370" url="?curid=875903" title="Béla IV of Hungary">
<text>Béla IV (1206 – 3 May 1270) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1235 and 1270, and Duke of Styria from 1254 to 1258. As the oldest son of King Andrew II, he was crowned upon the initiative of a group of influential noblemen in his father&#x27;s lifetime in 1214. His father, who strongly opposed Béla&#x27;s coronation, refused to give him a province to rule until 1220. In this year, Béla was appointed Duke of Slavonia, also with jurisdiction in Croatia and Dalmatia. Around the same time, Béla married Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. From 1226, he governed Transylvania as duke. He supported Christian missions among the pagan Cumans who dwelled in the plains to the east of his province. Some Cuman chieftains acknowledged his suzerainty and he adopted the title of King of Cumania in 1233. King Andrew died on 21 September 1235 and Béla succeeded him. He attempted to restore royal authority, which had diminished under his father. For this purpose, he revised his predecessors&#x27; land grants and reclaimed former royal estates, causing discontent among the noblemen and the prelates.

The Mongols invaded Hungary and annihilated Béla&#x27;s army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241. He escaped from the battlefield, but a Mongol detachment chased him from town to town as far as Trogir on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Although he survived the invasion, the Mongols devastated the country before their unexpected withdrawal in March 1242. Béla introduced radical reforms in order to prepare his kingdom for a second Mongol invasion. He allowed the barons and the prelates to erect stone fortresses and to set up their private armed forces. He promoted the development of fortified towns. During his reign, thousands of colonists arrived from the Holy Roman Empire, Poland and other neighboring regions to settle in the depopulated lands. Béla&#x27;s efforts to rebuild his devastated country won him the epithet of &quot;second founder of the state&quot; ().

He set up a defensive alliance against the Mongols, which included Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow and other Ruthenian and Polish princes. His allies supported him in occupying the Duchy of Styria in 1254, but it was lost to King Ottokar II of Bohemia six years later. During Béla&#x27;s reign, a wide buffer zone—which included Bosnia, Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) and other newly conquered regions—was established along the southern frontier of Hungary in the 1250s.

Béla&#x27;s relationship with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense in the early 1260s, because the elderly king favored his daughter Anna and his youngest child, Béla, Duke of Slavonia. He was forced to cede the territories of the Kingdom of Hungary east of the river Danube to Stephen, which caused a civil war lasting until 1266. Nevertheless, Béla&#x27;s family was famed for his piety: he died as a Franciscan tertiary, and the veneration of his three saintly daughters—Kunigunda, Yolanda, and Margaret—was confirmed by the Holy See.

==Childhood (1206–20)==

Béla was the oldest son of King Andrew II of Hungary by his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. He was born in the second half of 1206. Upon King Andrew&#x27;s initiative, Pope Innocent III had already appealed to the Hungarian prelates and barons on 7 June to swear an oath of loyalty to the King&#x27;s future son.

Queen Gertrude showed blatant favoritism towards her German relatives and courtiers, causing widespread discontent among the native lords. Taking advantage of her husband&#x27;s campaign in the distant Principality of Halych, a group of aggrieved noblemen seized and murdered her in the forests of the Pilis Hills on 28 September 1213. King Andrew only punished one of the conspirators, a certain Count Peter, after his return from Halych. Although Béla was a child when his mother was assassinated, he never forgot her and declared his deep respect for her in many of his royal charters.

Andrew II betrothed Béla to an unnamed daughter of Tzar Boril of Bulgaria in 1213 or 1214, but their engagement was broken. In 1214, the King requested the Pope to excommunicate some unnamed lords who were planning to crown Béla king. Even so, the eight-year-old Béla was crowned in the same year, but his father did not grant him a province to rule. Furthermore, when leaving for a Crusade to the Holy Land in August 1217, King Andrew appointed John, Archbishop of Esztergom, to represent him during his absence. During this period, Béla stayed with his maternal uncle Berthold of Merania in Steyr in the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew II returned from the Holy Land in late 1218. He had arranged the engagement of Béla and Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. She accompanied King Andrew to Hungary and Béla married her in 1220.

==&quot;Rex iunior&quot;==

===Duke of Slavonia (1220–26)===

The senior king ceded the lands between the Adriatic Sea and the Dráva River—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—to Béla in 1220. A letter of 1222 of Pope Honorius III reveals that &quot;some wicked men&quot; had forced Andrew II to share his realms with his heir. Béla initially styled himself as &quot;King Andrew&#x27;s son and King&quot; in his charters; from 1222 he used the title &quot;by the Grace of God, King, son of the King of Hungary, and Duke of all Slavonia&quot;.

Béla separated from his wife in the first half of 1222 upon his father&#x27;s demand. However, Pope Honorius refused to declare the marriage illegal. Béla accepted the Pope&#x27;s decision and took refuge in Austria from his father&#x27;s anger. He returned, together with his wife, only after the prelates had in the first half of 1223 persuaded his father to forgive him. Having returned to his Duchy of Slavonia, Béla launched a campaign against Domald of Sidraga, a rebellious Dalmatian nobleman, and captured Domald&#x27;s fortress at Klis. Domald&#x27;s domains were confiscated and distributed among his rivals, the Šubići, who had supported Béla during the siege.

===Duke of Transylvania (1226–35)===

King Andrew transferred Béla from Slavonia to Transylvania in 1226. In Slavonia, he was succeeded by his brother, Coloman. As Duke of Transylvania, Béla adopted an expansionist policy aimed at the territories over the Carpathian Mountains. He supported the Dominicans&#x27; proselytizing activities among the Cumans, who dominated these lands. In 1227 he crossed the mountains and met Boricius, a Cuman chieftain, who had decided to convert to Christianity. At their meeting, Boricius and his subjects were baptized and acknowledged Béla&#x27;s suzerainty. Within a year, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania was established in their lands.

Béla had long opposed his father&#x27;s &quot;useless and superfluous perpetual grants&quot;, because the distribution of royal estates destroyed the traditional basis of royal authority. He started reclaiming King Andrew&#x27;s land grants throughout the country in 1228. The Pope supported Béla&#x27;s efforts, but the King often hindered the execution of his son&#x27;s orders. Béla also confiscated the estates of two noblemen, brothers Simon and Michael Kacsics, who had plotted against his mother.

Béla&#x27;s youngest brother, Andrew, Prince of Halych, was expelled from his principality in the spring of 1229. Béla decided to help him to regain his throne, proudly boasting that the town of Halych &quot;would not remain on the face of the earth, for there was no one to deliver it from his hands&quot;, according to the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;. He crossed the Carpathian Mountains and laid siege to Halych together with his Cuman allies in 1229 or 1230. However, he could not seize the town and withdrew his troops. The &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; writes that many Hungarian soldiers &quot;died of many afflictions&quot; on their way home.

Béla invaded Bulgaria and besieged Vidin in 1228 or 1232, but he could not capture the fortress. Around the same time, he set up a new border province, the Banate of Szörény (Severin, Romania), in the lands between the Carpathians and the Lower Danube. In a token of his suzerainty in the lands east of the Carpathians, Béla adopted the title &quot;King of Cumania&quot; in 1233. Béla sponsored the mission of Friar Julian and three other Dominican friars who decided to visit the descendants of the Hungarians who had centuries earlier remained in &quot;Magna Hungaria&quot;, the Hungarians&#x27; legendary homeland.

==His reign==

===Before the Mongol invasion (1235–41)===

King Andrew died on 21 September 1235. Béla, who succeeded his father without opposition, was crowned king by Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom in Székesfehérvár on 14 October. He dismissed and punished many of his father&#x27;s closest advisors. For instance, he had Palatine Denis blinded and Julius Kán imprisoned. The former was accused of having, in King Andrew&#x27;s life, an adulterous liaison with Queen Beatrix, the King&#x27;s young widow. Béla ordered her imprisonment, but she managed to escape to the Holy Roman Empire, where she gave birth to a posthumous son, Stephen. Béla and his brother Coloman considered her son a bastard.

Béla declared that his principal purpose was &quot;the restitution of royal rights&quot; and &quot;the restoration of the situation which existed in the country&quot; in the reign of his grandfather, Béla III. According to the contemporaneous Roger of Torre Maggiore, he even &quot;had the chairs of the barons burned&quot; in order to prevent them from sitting in his presence during the meetings of the royal council. Béla set up special commissions which revised all royal charters of land grants made after 1196. The annulment of former donations alienated many of his subjects from the King. Pope Gregory IX protested strongly at the withdrawal of royal grants made to the Cistercians and the military orders. In exchange for Béla&#x27;s renouncing of the taking back of royal estates in 1239, the Pope authorized him to employ local Jews and Muslims in financial administration, which had for decades been opposed by the Holy See.

After returning from &quot;Magna Hungaria&quot; in 1236, Friar Julian informed Béla of the Mongols, who had by that time reached the Volga River and were planning to invade Europe. The Mongols invaded &quot;Desht-i Qipchaq&quot;—the westernmost regions of the Eurasian Steppes—and routed the Cumans. Fleeing the Mongols, at least 40,000 Cumans approached the eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary and demanded admission in 1239. Béla only agreed to give them shelter after their leader, Köten, promised to convert together with his people to Christianity, and to fight against the Mongols. However, the settlement of masses of nomadic Cumans in the plains along the Tisza River gave rise to many conflicts between them and the local villagers. Béla, who needed the Cumans&#x27; military support, rarely punished them for their robberies, rapes and other misdeeds. His Hungarian subjects thought that he was biased in the Cumans&#x27; favor, thus &quot;enmity emerged between the people and the king&quot;, according to Roger of Torre Maggiore.

Béla supported the development of towns. For instance, he confirmed the liberties of the citizens of Székesfehérvár and granted privileges to Hungarian and German settlers in Bars (Starý Tekov, Slovakia) in 1237. Zadar, a town in Dalmatia which had been lost to Venice in 1202, acknowledged Béla&#x27;s suzerainty in 1240.

===Mongol invasion of Hungary (1241–42)===

The Mongols gathered in the lands bordering Hungary and Poland under the command of Batu Khan in December 1240. They demanded Béla&#x27;s submission to their Great Khan Ögödei, but Béla refused to yield and had the mountain passes fortified. The Mongols broke through the barricades erected in the Verecke Pass (Veretsky Pass, Ukraine) on 12 March 1241.

Duke Frederick II of Austria, who arrived to assist Béla against the invaders, defeated a small Mongol troop near Pest. He seized prisoners, including Cumans from the Eurasian Steppes who had been forced to join the Mongols. When the citizens of Pest realized the presence of Cumans in the invading army, mass hysteria emerged. The townsfolk accused Köten and their Cumans of cooperating with the enemy. A riot broke out and the mob massacred Köten&#x27;s retinue. Köten was either slaughtered or committed suicide. On hearing about Köten&#x27;s fate, his Cumans decided to leave Hungary and destroyed many villages on their way towards the Balkan Peninsula.

With the Cumans&#x27; departure Béla lost his most valuable allies. He could muster an army of less than 60,000 against the invaders. The royal army was ill-prepared and its commanders—the barons alienated by Béla&#x27;s policy—&quot;would have liked the king to be defeated so that they would then be dearer to him&quot;, according to Roger of Torre Maggiore&#x27;s account. The Hungarian army was virtually annihilated in the Battle of Mohi on the Sajó River on 11 April 1241. A great number of Hungarian lords, prelates and noblemen were killed, and Béla himself narrowly escaped from the battlefield. He fled through Nyitra to Pressburg (Nitra and Bratislava in Slovakia). The triumphant Mongols occupied and ravaged most lands to the east of the Danube River by the end of June.

Upon Duke Frederick II of Austria&#x27;s invitation, Béla went to Hainburg an der Donau. However, instead of helping Béla, the Duke forced him to cede three counties (most probably Locsmánd, Pozsony, and Sopron). From Hainburg, Béla fled to Zagreb and sent letters to Pope Gregory IX, Emperor Frederick II, King Louis IX of France and other Western European monarchs, urging them to send reinforcements to Hungary. In the hope of military assistance, he even accepted Emperor Frederick II&#x27;s suzerainty in June. The Pope declared a Crusade against the Mongols, but no reinforcements arrived.

The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube early in 1242. A Mongol detachment under the command of Kadan, a son of Great Khan Ögödei, chased Béla from town to town in Dalmatia. Béla took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir. Before Kadan laid siege to the town in March, news arrived of the Great Khan&#x27;s death. Batu Khan wanted to attend at the election of Ögödei&#x27;s successor with sufficient troops and ordered the withdrawal of all Mongol forces. Béla, who was grateful to Trogir, granted it lands near Split, causing a lasting conflict between the two Dalmatian towns.

===&quot;Second Founder of the State&quot; (1242–61)===
Upon his return to Hungary in May 1242, Béla found a country in ruins. Devastation was especially heavy in the plains east of the Danube where at least half of the villages were depopulated. The Mongols had destroyed most traditional centers of administration, which were defended by earth-and-timber walls. Only well-fortified places, such as Esztergom, Székesfehérvár and the Pannonhalma Abbey, had successfully resisted siege. A severe famine followed in 1242 and 1243.

Preparation for a new Mongol invasion was the central concern of Béla&#x27;s policy. In a letter of 1247 to Pope Innocent IV, Béla announced his plan to strengthen the Danube—the &quot;river of confrontations&quot;—with new forts. He abandoned the ancient royal prerogative to build and own castles, promoting the erection of nearly 100 new fortresses by the end of his reign. These fortresses included a new castle Béla had built at Nagysáros (Veľký Šariš, Slovakia), and another castle Béla and his wife had built at Visegrád.

Béla attempted to increase the number of the soldiers and to improve their equipment. He made land grants in the forested regions and obliged the new landowners to equip heavily armoured cavalrymen to serve in the royal army. For instance, the so-called ten-lanced nobles of Szepes (Spiš, Slovakia) received their privileges from Béla in 1243. He even allowed the barons and prelates to employ armed noblemen, who had previously been directly subordinated to the sovereign, in their private retinue (banderium). Béla granted the Banate of Szörény to the Knights Hospitaller on 2 June 1247, but the Knights abandoned the region by 1260.
To replace the loss of at least 15 percent of the population, who perished during the Mongol invasion and the ensuing famine, Béla promoted colonization. He granted special liberties to the colonists, including personal freedom and favorable tax treatment. Germans, Moravians, Poles, Ruthenians and other &quot;guests&quot; arrived from neighboring countries and were settled in depopulated or sparsely populated regions. He also persuaded the Cumans, who had in 1241 left Hungary, to return and settle in the plains along the River Tisza. He even arranged the engagement of his firstborn son, Stephen, who was crowned king-junior in or before 1246, to Elisabeth, a daughter of a Cuman chieftain.

Béla granted the privileges of Székesfehérvár to more than 20 settlements, promoting their development into self-governing towns. The liberties of the mining towns in Upper Hungary were also spelled out in Béla&#x27;s reign. For defensive purposes, he moved the citizens of Pest to a hill on the opposite side of the Danube in 1248. Within two decades their new fortified town, Buda, became the most important center of commerce in Hungary. Béla also granted privileges to Gradec, the fortified center of Zagreb, in 1242 and confirmed them in 1266.

Béla adopted an active foreign policy soon after the withdrawal of the Mongols. In the second half of 1242 he invaded Austria and forced Duke Frederick II to surrender the three counties ceded to him during the Mongol invasion. On the other hand, Venice occupied Zadar in the summer of 1243. Béla renounced Zadar on 30 June 1244, but Venice acknowledged his claim to one third of the customs revenues of the Dalmatian town.

Béla set up a defensive alliance against the Mongols. He married three of his daughters to princes whose countries were also threatened by the Mongols. Rostislav Mikhailovich, a pretender to the Principality of Halych, was the first to marry, in 1243, one of Béla&#x27;s daughters, Anna. Béla supported his son-in-law to invade Halych in 1245, but Rostislav&#x27;s opponent, Daniil Romanovich repulsed their attack.

On 21 August 1245 Pope Innocent IV freed Béla of the oath of fidelity he had taken to Emperor Frederick during the Mongol invasion. In the following year Duke Frederick II of Austria invaded Hungary. He routed Béla&#x27;s army in the Battle of the Leitha River on 15 June 1246, but perished in the battlefield. His childless death gave rise to a series of conflicts, because both his niece, Gertrude, and his sister, Margaret, made a claim to Austria and Styria. Béla decided to intervene in the conflict only after the danger of a second Mongol invasion had diminished by the end of the 1240s. In retaliation of a former Austrian incursion into Hungary, Béla made a plundering raid into Austria and Styria in the summer of 1250. In this year he met and concluded a peace treaty with Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych in Zólyom (Zvolen, Slovakia). With Béla&#x27;s mediation, a son of his new ally Roman married Gertrude of Austria.

Béla and Daniil Romanovich united their troops and invaded Austria and Moravia in June 1252. After their withdrawal, Ottokar, Margrave of Moravia—who had married Margaret of Austria—invaded and occupied Austria and Styria. In the summer of 1253, Béla launched a campaign against Moravia and laid siege to Olomouc. Daniil Romanovich, Boleslaw the Chaste of Cracow, and Wladislaw of Opole intervened on Béla&#x27;s behalf, but he lifted the siege by the end of June. Pope Innocent IV mediated a peace treaty, which was signed in Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia) on 1 May 1254. In accordance with the treaty, Ottokar, who had in the meantime become King of Bohemia, ceded Styria to Béla.

Béla appointed his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich Ban of Macsó (Mačva, Serbia) in 1254. Rostislav&#x27;s task was the creation of a buffer zone along the southern borders. He invaded Bosnia already in the year of his appointment and forced Tzar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria to cede Belgrade and Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) in 1255. Béla adopted the title of King of Bulgaria, but he only used it occasionally in the subsequent years.

The Styrian noblemen rose up in rebellion against Béla&#x27;s governor Stephen Gutkeled and routed him in early 1258. Béla invaded Styria, restored his suzerainty and appointed his oldest son, Stephen, Duke of Styria. In 1259, Batu Khan&#x27;s successor, Berke, proposed an alliance by offering to marry one of his daughters to a son of Béla, but he refused the Khan&#x27;s offer.

Discontented with the rule of Béla&#x27;s son, the Styrian lords sought assistance from Ottokar of Bohemia. Béla and his allies—Daniil Romanovich, Boleslaw the Chaste, and Leszek the Black of Sieradz—invaded Moravia, but Ottokar vanquished them in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 June 1260. The defeat forced Béla to renounce Styria in favor of the King of Bohemia in the Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261. On the other hand, Ottokar divorced his elderly wife, Margarete of Austria, and married Béla&#x27;s granddaughter—the daughter of Rostislav Mikhailovich by Anna—Kunigunda.

Béla had originally planned to give his youngest daughter, Margaret, in marriage to King Ottokar. However, Margaret, who had been living in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits&#x27; Island, refused to yield. With the assistance of her Dominican confessor, she took her final religious vows which prevented her marriage. Infuriated by this act, the King, who had up to that time supported the Dominicans, favored the Franciscans in the subsequent years. He even became a Franciscan tertiary, according to the &quot;Greater Legend&quot; of his saintly sister, Elisabeth.

===Civil war (1261–66)===

Béla and his son, Stephen jointly invaded Bulgaria in 1261. They forced Tzar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria to abandon the region of Vidin. Béla returned to Hungary before the end of the campaign, which was continued by his son.

Béla&#x27;s favoritism towards his younger son, Béla (whom he appointed Duke of Slavonia) and daughter, Anna irritated Stephen. The latter suspected that his father was planning to disinherit him. Stephen often mentioned in his charters that he had &quot;suffered severe persecution&quot; by his &quot;parents without deserving it&quot; when referring to the roots of his conflict with his father. Although some clashes took place in the autumn, a lasting civil war was avoided through the mediation of the Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa who persuaded Béla and his son to make a compromise. According to the Peace of Pressburg, the two divided the country along the Danube: the lands to the west of the river remained under the direct rule of Béla, and the government of the eastern territories was taken over by Stephen, the king-junior.

The relationship between father and son remained tense. Stephen seized his mother&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s estates which were situated in his realm to the east of the Danube. Béla&#x27;s army under Anna&#x27;s command crossed the Danube in the summer of 1264. She occupied Sárospatak and captured Stephen&#x27;s wife and children. A detachment of the royal army, under the command of Béla&#x27;s Judge royal Lawrence forced Stephen to retreat as far as the fortress at Feketehalom (Codlea, Romania) in the easternmost corner of Transylvania. The king-junior&#x27;s partisans relieved the castle and he started a counter-attack in the autumn. In the decisive Battle of Isaszeg, he routed his father&#x27;s army in March 1265.

It was again the two archbishops who conducted the negotiations between Béla and his son. Their agreement was signed in the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits&#x27; Island (Margaret Island, Budapest) on 23 March 1266. The new treaty confirmed the division of the country along the Danube and regulated many aspects of the co-existence of Béla&#x27;s &quot;regnum&quot; and Stephen&#x27;s &quot;regimen&quot;, including the collection of taxes and the commoners&#x27; right to free movement.

===Last years (1266–70)===

The &quot;nobles of all Hungary, who are called &quot;servientes regis&quot;&quot; from both the senior and the junior king&#x27;s domains assembled in Esztergom in 1267. Upon their request, Béla and Stephen jointly confirmed their privileges, which had first been spelled out in the Golden Bull of 1222, before 7 September. Shortly after the meeting, Béla assigned four noblemen from each county with the task of revising property rights in Transdanubia.

King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia invaded the Banate of Macsó, a region under the rule of Béla&#x27;s widowed daughter, Anna. A royal army soon routed the invaders and captured Stephen Uroš. The Serbian monarch was forced to pay ransom before being released.

Béla&#x27;s favorite son, also named Béla, died in the summer of 1269. On 18 January 1270 the King&#x27;s youngest daughter, the saintly Margaret, also died. King Béla too soon fell terminally ill. On his deathbed, he asked his grandson-in-law King Ottokar II of Bohemia to assist his wife, daughter and partisans in case they were forced to leave Hungary by his son. Béla died on Rabbits&#x27; Island on 3 May 1270. Dying at 63, he exceeded in age most members of the House of Árpád. He was buried in the church of the Franciscans in Esztergom, but Archbishop Philip of Esztergom had his corpse transferred to the Esztergom Cathedral. The Minorites only succeeded in regaining Béla&#x27;s remains after a long lawsuit.

King Béla IV of Hungary left to his son, to Stephen, a prosperous, a rebuilt, a fortified kingdom in 28 years. Béla successfully concluded the alliance between the houses of Árpád and Anjou with a mutual marriage contract. In the last year of his life, in December 1269, Abbot of Monte Cassino Bernhard Ayglerius visited Hungary as the envoy of King Charles I of Anjou. He reported enthusiastically to his lord, the foreign, impartial contemporary envoy saw Béla&#x27;s court as follows:

&quot;The Hungarian royal house has incredible power, its military forces are so large that nobody in the East and the North dares even budge if the triumphant and glorious king mobilizes his army. Most of the countries and princes of the North and East belong to his empire by kinship or conquest.&quot;

==Family==

Béla&#x27;s wife, Maria Laskarina was born in 1207 or 1208, according to historian Gyula Kristó. She died in July or August 1270. Their first child, Kunigunda, was born in 1224, four years after her parents&#x27; marriage. She married Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow in 1246.

A second daughter, Margaret followed Kunigunda in about 1225; she died unmarried before 1242. The third daughter of Béla, Anna was born around 1226. She and her husband, Rostislav Mikhailovich were especially favored by Béla. Her great-grandson, Wenceslaus—a grandson of her daughter, Kunigunda by King Ottokar II of Bohemia—was King of Hungary from 1301 to 1305.

Béla&#x27;s fourth daughter, Catherina died unmarried before 1242. Next, Elisabeth was born; she was given in marriage to Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria in about 1245. Her son, Otto was crowned King of Hungary in 1305, but was forced to leave the country by the end of 1307. Béla&#x27;s sixth daughter Constance married, around 1251, Lev Danylovich, second son of Prince Daniil Romanovich of Halych. Béla&#x27;s seventh daughter, Yolanda became the wife of Bolesław the Pious, Duke of Greater Poland.

Béla&#x27;s first son, Stephen was born in 1239. He succeeded his father. Béla&#x27;s youngest daughter, Margaret was born during the Mongol invasion in 1242. Dedicated to God by her parents at birth, she spent her life in humility in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits&#x27; Island and died as a Dominican nun. The King&#x27;s youngest (namesake) son, Béla was born between around 1243 and 1250.

The &quot;Greater Legend&quot; of Saint Elisabeth of Hungary (Béla&#x27;s sister) described Béla&#x27;s family as a company of saints. It wrote that the &quot;blessed royal family of the Hungarians is adorned with resplendent pearls that irradiate all the earth&quot;. In fact, the Holy See sanctioned the veneration of three daughters of Béla and his wife: Kunigunda was beatified in 1690, Yolanda in 1827; and Margaret was canonized in 1943. A fourth daughter, Constance also became subject to a local cult in Lemberg (Lviv, Ukraine), according to the &quot;Legend&quot; of her sister, Kunigunda.

The following family tree presents Béla&#x27;s offspring, and some of his relatives mentioned in the article.




==Legacy==

Bryan Cartledge writes that Béla &quot;reorganised the structure of government, re-established the rule of law, repopulated a devastated countryside, encouraged the growth of towns, created the new royal town of Buda and revived the commercial life of the country&quot; during his over three-decade-long reign. Béla&#x27;s posthumous epithet—the &quot;second founder of the state&quot; ()—shows that posterity attributed to him Hungary&#x27;s survival of the Mongol invasion. On the other hand, the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; notes that Béla &quot;was a man of peace, but in the conduct of armies and battles the least fortunate&quot; when narrating Béla&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Kressenbrunn. The same chronicle preserved the next epigram which was written on his tomb:

<text>United Indians of All Tribes (also known as the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, or UIATF) is a non-profit foundation that provides social and educational services to Native Americans in the Seattle metropolitan area and aims to promote the well being of the Native American community of the area. The organization is based at the Daybreak Star Cultural Center in Seattle, Washington&#x27;s Discovery Park. UIATF has an annual budget of approximately $4.5 million as of 2013.

==History of Native Americans in the Seattle area==
Many tribes historically inhabited the Seattle area and, to a greater extent, the surrounding Puget Sound area, because of the rich resources of food and fish. Major groups of local contemporary native peoples or tribes include the Suquamish, Duwamish, Nisqually, Snoqualmie, and Muckleshoot (Ilalkoamish, Stuckamish, and Skopamish) tribes. Many Alaskan Natives and Native Americans from the Inland Northwest have also come to live in Seattle. As a result, the city has a large and very diverse urban Indian population. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there are 86,649 American Indians/Alaskan Natives living in the Seattle, Tacoma, and Bremerton area. The Seattle area has become a nexus of many different tribal cultures from all over the country, with large influences from Coast Salish, Tlingit, Haida, and Plateau Indian cultures.

==History of Daybreak Star==

UIATF was established in 1970 during the struggle by Northwest Natives to gain ownership or control of a portion of Fort Lawton, as the United States Army had shrunk its base there. Bernie Whitebear emerged as the group&#x27;s CEO, a position he held until shortly before his death from cancer in 2000. After winning the concession of a renewable 99-year lease on 20 acres (81,000 square meters) in what was to become Discovery Park, Whitebear led the fund-raising for Daybreak Star. Whitebear&#x27;s brother, the designer and sculptor Lawney Reyes, set forth the &quot;philosophy, nomenclature, and organizational needs of UIATF,&quot; working with Northwest architect Arai Jackson to design the center. Whitebear negotiated with then-governor Daniel J. Evans for a $1 million construction grant from Washington State; he also obtained an $80,000 grant for artwork for the building&#x27;s interior from the Seattle Arts Commission, of which he became a member. Further donations came from tribes and corporations, including many of the materials used in the building.
Beginning in 1975 with the grant for artwork, the foundation opened the Sacred Circle Art Gallery at Daybreak Star. The Sacred Circle Art Gallery features both a permanent collection as well as a temporary exhibit space. Until 2001, the gallery featured contemporary art by renowned Native artists such as James Lavadour, Edgar Heap of Birds, and Marvin Oliver. After Whitebear&#x27;s death, a new group of leaders made changes to the gallery, such as changing its name from the Sacred Circle Art Gallery to the Daybreak Star Indian Art Gallery, whittling two viewing rooms down to one, and shifting the focus away from contemporary Native American art. The gallery carries some contemporary work and continues to rebrand itself. Daybreak has also put on several art markets throughout the year.

==Other initiatives==
The United Indians of all Tribes Foundation also provides programs such as Indian child welfare services, therapy, and treatment; elder services, including a lunch program; a GED education program; and youth services, including advocacy, substance abuse treatment, and housing for homeless youth. Other programs have included the Ina Maka family program, education and employment services, a child development center, and the ECEAP (Early Childhood Education &amp; Assistance Program) preschool. The foundation also organizes the annual Seafair Indian Days, one of the larger pow-wows in the Northwest, held in conjunction with the city&#x27;s festival called Seafair. The pow-wow draws tribal members from across the state, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Canada.

Youth services include the 25-bed home Labateyah Youth Home (sometimes written &quot;La-ba-te-yah&quot;) at 9010 13th Avenue NW, near Holman Road in Seattle&#x27;s Crown Hill neighborhood. Since 1992, Labateyah has offered transitional and state group housing to youth between the ages of 18 and 24. The name &quot;Labateyah&quot; is Lushootseed for &quot;the transformer&quot;. The program is not exclusively for Native American youth, who compose about a quarter of the facility&#x27;s clients.

Another initiative contemplated by Whitebear was the People&#x27;s Lodge at Daybreak Star, intended to include a Hall of Ancestors, a Potlatch House, a theater, and a museum, later called the &quot;Daybreak Star Village&quot; proposal, a project now indefinitely postponed for financial reasons. There is also the Pacific Northwest Indian Canoe Center, intended as part of the ongoing development at South Lake Union, just north of downtown,—for which ground was broken February 28, 2007. Both the People&#x27;s Lodge and the Canoe Center were conceived by Whitebear but left in the planning phases at the time of his death.

Current UIATF initiatives include:

*The Community Story, a program to facilitate assisting the local indigenous community through input from the Native community and integrating the input into the foundation&#x27;s programming and to identify their needs.
*Pathways to Prosperity, a program aimed to alleviate poverty by providing the necessary tools and knowledge to break this cycle in the Native community.

Proposed UIATF initiatives include:
*Daybreak Star College, a primary and secondary preparatory school.
*Bernie Whitebear Center for Human and Community Development, in White Center, an unincorporated neighborhood between Seattle and Burien, an area where there are an increasing number of Native Americans.
*Daybreak Star Youth Summer Camp.

A $3.5 million grant received October 2007 from the Northwest Area Foundation should allow the Bernie Whitebear Center, Daybreak Star College—two of the proposed projects—and the Northwest Canoe Center to proceed. The Canoe Center will be on South Lake Union. The grant will also fund various economic development activities focused on employment and small business development.

<text>The Halton County Radial Railway is a working museum of electric streetcars, other railway vehicles, buses and trolleybuses. It is operated by the Ontario Electric Railway Historical Association (OERHA). It is focused primarily on the history of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and its predecessor, the Toronto Transportation Commission, Its collection includes PCC, Peter Witt, CLRV and ALRV, and earlier cars from the Toronto streetcar system as well as G-series and M-series Toronto subway cars.

The museum is open to the public, with rides on many of its vehicles. It is located between the villages of Rockwood and Campbellville in Milton, Ontario, Canada, along part of the Toronto Suburban Railway&#x27;s former right-of-way. The tracks conform to the TTC&#x27;s track gauge of , which is wider than . Vehicles from other systems must be altered to accommodate the tracks, and cars intended for third-rail power must be reconfigured for use with overhead wire. In 1889, electric railway service on routes radiating from Toronto, Ontario began. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected at the Halton County Radial Railway Museum by the province to commemorate the Radial Railways&#x27; role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage. 
Museum Peter Witt streetcars can be seen in the 2005 film &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; on the streets of Toronto to give it a 1930s New York City appearance.

==History==
The Halton County Radial Railway and the OERHA was formed in 1953 by a group of men who wanted to save Toronto Transit Commission streetcar 1326 from being sent to the scrap yard. After the donation of this streetcar, the dream grew. Land that used to be a part of the Toronto Suburban Railway in Nassagaweya Township was acquired, and subsequently, a number of other street and radial cars were eventually rescued. The museum&#x27;s grand opening took place in 1972.

Since the beginning, the vision of the HCRR was to inform, educate and inspire the public about the electric railway history of Ontario and Canada. Today, the museum displays and operates a variety of historic streetcars, radial cars and work cars, and maintains a collection of photographs, memorabilia and archival materials. The oldest rail car in the collection dates from the late 1800s.

<text>Andruw Rudolf Jones (; born April 23, 1977) is a Curaçaoan former professional baseball center fielder who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), most notably for the Atlanta Braves. Jones also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. Jones was a noted defensive specialist for most of his career and won the Rawlings Gold Glove Award for outfielders every year from 1998 through 2007. He had a strong throwing arm in addition to his elite fielding. He was an MLB All-Star five times, and he won both the Hank Aaron Award and a Silver Slugger Award for outfielders in 2005.

Jones made his MLB debut during the 1996 season with the Atlanta Braves. In the 1996 World Series, he became the youngest player ever to hit a home run in the postseason, and just the second player ever to homer in his first two World Series at-bats. The following season, Jones finished fifth in voting for Rookie of the Year. From 1998 to 1999, he continued to increase his offensive production, and in 2000, Jones batted .303 with 36 home runs and 104 runs batted in (RBIs), making his first All-Star team. Jones started to draw many comparisons to Willie Mays and was considered one of the top center fielders in baseball. He proved to be a top defensive player, leading all center fielders in putouts and total zone runs five years in a row from 1998 to 2002. In 2001, he again hit over 30 home runs and drove in 104 runs but his average dipped to .251 while his strikeouts increased. Jones improved with All-Star seasons in 2002 and 2003, but in 2004, he failed to hit at least 30 home runs for the first time since 1999 and exceeded 100 strikeouts, which became a regular occurrence thereafter. In 2005, he led the National League (NL) with 51 home runs and 128 RBIs, finishing second to Albert Pujols for NL Most Valuable Player. In subsequent seasons, his average continued to dip and his strikeouts increased. After a productive season in 2006, including a career- high 129 RBIs, in 2007 Jones had his weakest season to that point, batting just .222. During his time with Atlanta, Jones became one of the youngest players in MLB history to reach 300 career home runs.

After the 2007 season, Jones signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers as a free agent to a two-year deal, worth $36.2 million. However, Jones struggled with the Dodgers, batting just .158 with three home runs and 14 RBIs. Shortly after the season, Jones was released. Jones concluded his MLB career with brief stints for the Rangers, White Sox, and Yankees, transitioning from a center fielder to designated hitter and a fourth outfielder role. While with the White Sox, Jones hit his 400th career home run.

==Early life==

Jones was born on April 23, 1977, in the capital city of Willemstad on the Caribbean island nation of Curaçao. By the age of 11, Jones was on a youth select team that traveled all the way to Japan to play in a tournament. He could handle any position on the field, but because of his powerful arm, Jones often found himself at catcher or third base. He switched to the outfield a couple of years later.

==Early professional career==
Jones signed with the Atlanta Braves organization as a free agent in 1993 at the age of 16. Jones was promoted to Danville of the Appalachian League after only 27 games with the Braves farm team in West Palm Beach, Florida. Jones played for Class-A Macon in 1995. In his first at bat, he belted a homer. He finished the season with 25 home runs and 100 runs batted in. Jones also led the South Atlantic League with 56 steals. His outstanding season was capped off when he was named Minor League Player of the Year.

==Professional career==

===Major League Baseball===

====Atlanta Braves (1996–2007)====
The Braves brought Jones up to Atlanta on August 15, 1996, when he was just 19 years old. In his first career Major League game, Jones went 1-for-5 with a run batted in and a run scored. In his second game, he went 2-for-5 with a home run and a triple. He had his first multi-homer game against the Reds on August 22. He spent his early time in the majors playing in right field because established center fielder Marquis Grissom was already entrenched in the position. He finished the season batting .217 with five home runs and 13 RBIs. Jones was selected to the Braves&#x27; postseason roster in 1996. In the National League Championship Series against the Cardinals, Jones batted .222 with a home run and 3 RBIs. The Braves won the Series and advanced to the World Series.

In Game 1 of the 1996 World Series on October 20, 1996, Jones was able to demonstrate his talents on the national stage. He connected for two home runs to left field on his first two at bats as the Braves routed the New York Yankees 12–1. Jones became the youngest player ever to homer in the World Series at the age of 19 years, 180 days, breaking Mickey Mantle&#x27;s record of 20 years, 362 days — on what would have been Mantle&#x27;s 65th birthday. Jones joined Gene Tenace as the only other player to hit home runs in his first two World Series at bats. Tenace did it in 1972 with the Oakland Athletics.

Jones became the Braves&#x27; everyday right fielder in 1997. Jones hit his first home run of the season against Jeff McCurry of the Rockies. Jones had his second multi-homer game against the Cubs on July 22. On August 31, Jones went 3-for-3 with a home run and five runs batted in a game against the Boston Red Sox. Jones finished his rookie season with a .231 batting average, 18 home runs, and 70 runs batted in. Jones also showed his speed by stealing 20 bases. He finished 5th in Rookie of the Year voting. In 1998, he moved to center field nearly full-time, and had a much more encouraging season. He hit his 30th home run of the season against Florida on September 13. He also won his first of ten straight Gold Glove Awards. In the 1998 National League Division Series, Jones went 0 for 9 but did draw 3 walks. The Braves won the series against the Cubs. In the 1998 NLCS against the San Diego Padres, Jones batted .273 with a home run and two RBIs. However, The Braves lost the series in six games. 

Whether he was in the batter&#x27;s box or gliding under a fly ball to make an easy basket catch, Jones played the game in a very relaxed manner. This temporarily earned him the ire of manager Bobby Cox in June 1998 in an incident in which Cox pulled Jones out of a game, in the midst of an inning, because he felt Jones had lazily allowed a single to drop in center field. Jones went on to hit .271 with 31 home runs and 90 runs batted in and stole 27 bases.
Still just 22 years old, Jones had similar numbers in 1999. He had a breakout season with his bat in 2000 with career highs up until that point in batting average (.303), home runs (36), and RBIs (104). He also earned his first All-Star Game appearance. He also led the National League in Plate Appearances (729) and At Bats (656). Jones struggled in the National League Division Series against the Cardinals. He went 1 for 9 with a home run. The Braves lost the series.

However, in 2001, Jones&#x27; batting average fell and his strikeouts went up. Jones finished with 34 home runs and 104 RBIs but his average dropped to only .251 and he struck out 142 times. By now, Jones had gained nearly 30 pounds since arriving in the Major Leagues, greatly diminishing his speed on the basepaths (he would not steal more than 11 bases after 2001). He maintained a similar batting performance in 2002, but was still playing superb defense. On September 7, he belted two home runs in his last two at-bats. In his first two at-bats on September 10, he belted two more home runs. He became the 11th player in MLB history to homer in four straight at-bats. Then on September 25, Jones belted three home runs against the Phillies. Jones became the first Braves player to hit three home runs in a game since Jeff Blauser did it in 1992. Jones was named to his second All Star team. He ended the season with 35 home runs and 94 RBIs.

In 2003, with the power-hitting Gary Sheffield in the line-up, Jones achieved a new career high-water mark in RBIs, with 116. Jones made his third All Star team and homered in the game. The American League beat the National League, 7–6. In the 2004 season, he took a step backward when he hit fewer than 30 homers and struck out 147 times. During the season, Jones was the subject of trade rumors.

====Breakout in 2005====
Prior to the 2005 season, Jones increased his workout regimen and followed advice given by Willie Mays to widen his batting stance. The result was his most productive offensive season ever. After Chipper Jones went down with an injury early in 2005, Jones carried the Braves. By the All Star break, Jones was leading the National League in home runs with 27. Jones was named to the All Star team, the fourth of his career. Jones hit his 40th home run of the season on August 23 in a loss against the Cubs. It marked the first time in his career that he hit at least 40 home runs in a season. Jones became the first Braves hitter to hit 40 home runs in a season since Javy Lopez did it in 2003. On September 14, 2005, Jones hit his 300th career home run which went off Philadelphia Phillies reliever Geoff Geary in a 12–4 Phillies win. The ball landed in the upper deck in left field at Citizens Bank Park. Jones became the first hitter since Alex Rodriguez (57) and Jim Thome (52) to hit at least 50 home runs in a season. Jones also became the 12th player in history to hit 300 home runs before his 30th birthday.

Jones hit a major league-leading 51 home runs, surpassing Hank Aaron&#x27;s and Eddie Mathews&#x27; single-season club record, and winning the Babe Ruth Home Run Award. He also led the National League with a career-high 128 RBI. Jones&#x27; torrid hitting in the summer, especially while teammate Chipper Jones was out with an injury, helped carry the Braves to their 14th consecutive division championship. He finished just behind St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols in the 2005 NL MVP vote. In the 2005, National League Divisional Series against the Houston Astros, Jones hit .471 with a home run and five RBIs. However, the Astros took the series, 3–1.

====2006====

Before the 2006 season, Jones played in the World Baseball Classic for the Netherlands. Jones started the season by hitting a home run off a pitch from Derek Lowe. Jones finished the game by going 2 for 4 with a home run, 4 runs batted in, a strikeout, and a base on balls. The Braves won the game, 11–10. From April 16 through April 19, Jones homered in 4 consecutive games. During that stretch, he batted .438 with 5 home runs and 8 runs batted in. Jones finished the month of April with a .281 average, 8 home runs and 23 runs batted in (RBI).

Jones matched his career high with 6 runs batted in on July 18 against the Cardinals. He also went 5 for 5 with 2 home runs. On August 29, in a game against the Giants, Jones drove in 3 runs, which gave him his 1000th career RBI. On September 26, in a game against the New York Mets, Jones hit his 40th home run of the season. He became the first hitter in Atlanta&#x27;s history to have consecutive seasons of at least 40 homers. Jones finished the 2006 season with 41 home runs and 129 RBIs. Jones also became more selective at the plate (82 walks, as compared to 64 the prior season), which helped him score 107 runs during 2006, an increase of 12 over the prior year and his most in a single season since 2000. He won his ninth consecutive Gold Glove award. The Braves finished with a 79–83 record and missed the postseason for the first time since 1990.

====2007====

Coming into the last year of his contract with the Braves, many fans and sports analysts alike felt that 2007 would be his last year as a Brave, mostly because of his potential value on the market that the Braves would not be able to afford. Jones, however, had an unexpectedly poor start to the season, striking out 51 times in 41 games and carrying a batting average in the low .200s for the majority of April and May.

On April 30, Jones hit a three-run walk-off home run against the Philadelphia Phillies. On May 28, Jones hit his 350th career homer off Chris Capuano. After the All-Star break, Jones continued to have productive power numbers; however, his batting average remained poor. He was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding center fielder in MLB. Jones finished the 2007 season with 26 home runs and 94 RBIs. On the downside, Jones hit only .222 and struck out 138 times.

On October 2, the Braves announced they would not be bringing Jones back for the 2008 season.

====Los Angeles Dodgers (2008)====
On December 5, 2007, Jones agreed to a two-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, worth $36.2 million. After showing up out of shape and over 20 pounds overweight, he continued to struggle, hitting below .200 for most of the season. Additionally, he had only 10 hits in 116 at-bats with runners in scoring position. Due to his lack of production, Jones was dropped to eighth in the Dodger line-up. This was the first time since 1998 that Jones had hit eighth in any line-up.

Jones was put on the disabled list for the first time in his entire career on May 25, 2008. He had knee surgery after injuring his knee during batting practice earlier that day. On July 27, 2008, the Dodgers manager Joe Torre benched Jones and said that he would only be used as a spot starter in the future. At that time, Jones had a .166 batting average, two home runs and 12 RBIs combined with 68 strikeouts in 187 at-bats.

On September 13, 2008, Jones was put on the 60-day disabled list, and removed from the playoff roster, putting an end to his season with the Dodgers. Jones finished the season with a .158 batting average, just three home runs, and 14 RBI. Jones stated that he did not wish to return to the Dodgers in 2009, saying that the Los Angeles fans did not give him a fair chance.
During the 2009 off-season, the Dodgers reached an agreement with Jones to trade or release him before spring training in exchange for a deferral of some of the remaining money due on his contract. On January 15, 2009, Jones was officially released by the Dodgers.

====Texas Rangers (2009)====
On February 8, 2009, Jones signed a one-year minor league contract with the Texas Rangers; the deal paid him $500,000 for making the major league team, and offered $1 million in incentives. Jones reportedly turned down a similar offer from the New York Yankees to compete for their center field job and expressed an interest in staying with the Rangers even though he would likely not be a starter. He earned the Rangers&#x27; final roster spot.

He was originally intended to be a pinch-hitter for the Rangers, but found a starting outfield role due to an injury to Josh Hamilton. Jones would go 3-for-5 in his Rangers debut with an RBI and two runs scored. By the end of April, Jones was batting .344 with three home runs and six runs batted in.

Jones was also faced with an opportunity to play against his old club, the Dodgers. Jones played two games against them on June 13 and 14, homering in each game. On July 4, Jones went 2 for 5 with a home run and 4 runs batted in against the Rays. On July 8, in a game against the Angels, Jones hit three home runs and drove in four runs in an 8–1 win. It was his second career three-homer game. Jones had a chance to hit his fourth home run of the game in his final two at-bats, but he popped out and struck out. &quot;I was thinking about it. I tried. I just didn&#x27;t get it done,&quot; Jones said. &quot;I&#x27;m just happy we won.&quot; Jones ultimately hit only .214 for the season, but did have 17 home runs in 82 games.

====Chicago White Sox (2010)====
On November 25, 2009, Jones signed a $500,000 deal for 2010 with up to an additional $1 million in performance bonuses. Unlike what he had done with the Braves and Dodgers in previous seasons, Jones showed up to camp in shape, a full 30 pounds under his previous weight. On April 23, 2010, Jones hit two home runs on his 33rd birthday, including a walk-off to help the White Sox win 7–6 over the Seattle Mariners. On July 11, he hit his 400th career home run.

He finished the year with nineteen home runs in 278 at-bats. He scored 41 runs, had 48 RBI and 64 base hits in 107 games, the most games he appeared in since 2007.

====New York Yankees (2011–2012)====

On January 20, 2011, Jones and the New York Yankees agreed to a contract for the 2011 season for $2 million, with an additional $1.2 million in performance bonuses.
In his first Yankees at-bat on April 5, 2011, Jones hit a home run over the left field wall at Yankee Stadium off the Minnesota Twins&#x27; Brian Duensing.

Jones finished the season with a .247 average, 13 home runs and 33 runs batted in. He became a free agent after the World Series.

Jones re-signed with the Yankees for the 2012 season on December 30, 2011, signing a one-year deal worth $2 million. He was slated to be a backup. However, due to Brett Gardner&#x27;s DL stint, Jones received more starts than anticipated. Jones played very well in the first half of the season hitting 12 home runs in his first 62 games, including three over the course of a doubleheader in Boston, but in August and September he hit only .139 with two home runs over his final 32 games.

===Nippon Professional Baseball===

====Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles (2013–2014)====

On December 7, 2012, Jones agreed to a one-year, ¥300 million (approximately US$3.5 million) contract with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Japan&#x27;s Pacific League. He finished the regular season with 26 home runs in 478 at-bats. He scored 81 runs, had 94 RBI, 116 base hits and 105 walks in 143 games, helping Eagles to clinch their first Pacific League Championship. His steady performance continued in postseason, including two home runs in the 2013 Pacific League Climax Series and one in the 2013 Japan Series respectively, which played a key role in the Eagles&#x27; Japan Series win. After the season, Jones re-signed with Rakuten for the 2014 season, agreeing to a one-year contract worth ¥400 million (approximately US$3.8 million). In his two years with Rakuten, Jones hit 50 home runs and played primarily at designated hitter, however he played 48 games at first base, far more than the eight he played in his career before coming to Japan.

====Retirement====
Since playing in Japan, Jones attempted comebacks in both the 2015 and 2016 MLB seasons. He officially retired from baseball in February 2016 and was hired by the Braves as a special assistant later that month. On April 3, 2023, the Braves announced that Jones&#x27;s number 25 would be retired by the team on September 9, 2023.

==Career summary==
Jones ended his career with a .254/.337/.486 slash line, along with 434 home runs and 1,289 runs batted in. His home run total was tied for 40th on the all-time home run list when he ended his career. However, Jones&#x27; weakness was hitting against breaking balls and hitting for good average. Only once in his career did Jones bat .300 or better (he batted .303 in 2000), and he hit just .214 in the final six seasons of his career.

Jones was also known for his speed early in his career. In fact, his speed earned him the last playoff spot on the Braves&#x27; roster in 1996. Jones stole 20 or more bases from 1997 to 2000. However, his speed declined as he hit for more power. Jones never stole 10 bases after he stole 11 in 2001. This could also be attributed to a noticeable weight gain.

Jones also owned the lowest batting average (since broken by Jose Bautista in 2010), slugging percentage, on-base percentage, and runs scored in a season for a hitter that belted 50+ home runs in a season. Jones hit 51 in 2005 but batted just .263, with a .575 slugging percentage, .347 on-base percentage, and 95 runs scored.

From 1998 to 2007, Jones won 10 consecutive Gold Gloves. His 10 Gold Gloves for an outfielder ranks him in a tie for third (behind Willie Mays and Roberto Clemente each with 12) with Al Kaline, Ichiro Suzuki, and Ken Griffey Jr. for most Gold Gloves won by an outfielder. Jones is also one of five center fielders to record at least 400 putouts in a season six times; the others are Willie Mays, Richie Ashburn, Kirby Puckett, and Max Carey. Jones has been ranked by Fangraphs as the most valuable defensive outfielder in baseball history.

==International career==
Being born in Curaçao allowed Jones to be eligible for the Netherlands national baseball team during their participation in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006. Jones would later join the team again for the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

Two years later, in 2015, Jones was selected to play with the National Dutch team as a first baseman for the 2015 Premier 12. He later announced that those were his final games as a player.

==Personal life==
In July 2001, Jones testified in the federal trial of Steve Kaplan, an Atlanta club owner charged with facilitating prostitution. Jones told the Court that he was a regular at the club and that, on one occasion, Kaplan arranged for a limousine to bring him to a hotel where he had sex with a group of people. He further testified that he made no payment during the encounter because Kaplan had told him that it was a party.

Jones married Nicole Derick. They are the parents of one son, Druw, and one daughter, Madison. Druw was the top prospect in the 2022 Major League Baseball draft and was selected second overall by the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Early on the morning of Christmas Day, 2012, Jones was arrested for battery after police officers responded to a domestic disturbance call between him and his wife Nicole in suburban Atlanta. He was released on $2,400 bond late that morning. Nicole Jones filed for divorce in early January 2013. His wife later withdrew the action for divorce and the couple attempted to reconcile, though Jones eventually pleaded guilty, paid a fine and was placed on probation.

<text>Royal Air Force Boulmer or more simply RAF Boulmer is a Royal Air Force station near Alnwick in Northumberland, England, and is home to Aerospace Surveillance and Control System (ASACS) Force Command, Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) Boulmer. 

The School of Aerospace Battle Management and support staff was based there until 26 July 2019; it has since moved to RAF Shawbury. Until 30 September 2015, it was also home to A Flight, No. 202 Squadron RAF, who flew the Westland Sea King HAR.3 in the SAR (Search and Rescue) role.

==History==

===Second World War===
In 1940 a decoy airfield was set up near the village of Boulmer to divert German attacks from nearby Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields such as RAF Acklington. As the air threat to the United Kingdom receded, the decoy airfield, with its grass runways and plywood and canvas Hurricanes, was abandoned.

In March 1943 RAF Boulmer was reopened as a satellite airfield to house the advanced flights of No. 57 Operational Training Unit RAF (a Supermarine Spitfire training unit based at RAF Eshott, Boulmer&#x27;s parent unit). 

Part of the airfield formed the basis of a caravan site with the runway and taxiway being used as an access road to the site. The site remains and is called Seaton Park.

===Cold War===
By 1950, the threat of the atomic bomb had caused a serious rethink in the organisation of air defence and a plan, codenamed ROTOR, was brought in to replace many of the existing stations with new protected underground operations rooms. The site chosen for one of these new underground Ground-controlled interception (GCI) stations was close to the former RAF Boulmer which had been returned to agriculture at the end of the Second World War.

The station was to have a two-level underground operations room designated as an R3. The R3 was never intended to survive a direct hit from a nuclear weapon but was designed to withstand a near miss from Russian bombing with 2,200 lb armour-piercing high explosive bombs dropped from 35,000 feet.

A target date for completion of the station was set as 21 August 1953 and although not complete, the station opened on time with limited capabilities using an American AN/FPS3 long-range search radar and an AN/TPS10 height finder. The station became known as 500 Signals Unit under the control of RAF Acklington and part of 13 Group - the station motto &#x27;Semper in excubitu vigilans&#x27; is taken from 500 Signals Unit&#x27;s badge. On completion of the R3 in September 1954 the station became fully operational.

In the autumn of 1957 RAF Boulmer was designated a Group Control Centre, with responsibility for the RAF Radar Stations at Buchan and Killard Point. By 1958, Boulmer was selected to be upgraded with the installation of the more modern-high powered Type 84 Surveillance radar. This increased the range of detection and was able to penetrate the latest Soviet jamming technology.

In 1971 Border Radar was established at Boulmer: this was a joint military/civil facility providing air traffic control services to co-ordinate civil and military traffic. Although still operational until the late 1980s, the unit closed when all Area Air Traffic Services were centralised between West Drayton and Prestwick.

By 1974 the Station had evolved to become both a Sector Operations Centre (SOC) and Control and Reporting Centre (CRC).

In 1978 RAF Boulmer took on an additional role as a search and rescue station following the closure of RAF Acklington, a role that it fulfilled until 30 September 2015. Initially the station was equipped with Westland Whirlwind helicopters; however, in December 1978 the station was re-equipped with Westland Sea King aircraft.

The next major change came in 1982 when the R3 bunker was vacated and work begun to upgrade it to an R3A. During this period the CRC was relocated to an above ground facility while the work was carried out.

In 1990, Boulmer&#x27;s links with Air Defence were reinforced by the arrival of the School of Fighter Control from RAF West Drayton. Following an extensive refurbishment the bunker was returned to operations in 1993. However, with the end of the Cold War the CRC was used in a standby role only with the homeland defence task being conducted from RAF Buchan and RAF Neatishead.

===Post Cold War===
In 1994, No. 1 Air Control Centre (No 1 ACC) reformed at RAF Boulmer, providing the Royal Air Force with deployable fielded air command and control capability.

In 2002, the Station began a major refurbishment of the underground bunker and installation of new equipment as part of the UKADGE Capability Maintenance Programme (UCMP). Valued at £60 million, the first phase of the programme was declared operational at RAF Boulmer on 16 August 2004.

In 2004 RAF Boulmer&#x27;s newly refurbished NATO Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) took over all air defence functions previously administered by the CRCs at RAF Buchan and RAF Neatishead.

In late July 2004 it was announced that RAF Boulmer would close by 2012, with the majority of its functions transferring to RAF Scampton. The first action taken in response to this announcement was for No 1 ACC to move to RAF Kirton in Lindsey, a former RAF Fighter Command airfield in Lincolnshire. This would bring the Air Command and Control elements of the Air Surveillance and Control System (ASACS) (the new CRC at RAF Scampton) geographically closer to the ISTAR elements such as the E3 Sentry AWACS force at RAF Waddington. No 1 ACC&#x27;s move to Kirton was completed in early 2005.

On 10 January 2008 it was announced that a study had been conducted into where to locate the elements of the Air Surveillance and Control System (ASACS). The results concluded that the best option in both financial and operational terms is to retain RAF Boulmer as the ASACS hub and as a result the station would stay open beyond 2012.

&#x27;A&#x27; Flight was one of the three operational flights of No. 202 Squadron RAF and was based at RAF Boulmer, the Sea King HAR.3 helicopter was used, &#x27;A&#x27; Flight provided round-the-clock search and rescue cover for a large area, stretching from Fife in the north to Hartlepool in the south and encompassing the Lake District in the west.

On 30 September 2015 &#x27;A&#x27; Flight of No. 202 Squadron departed RAF Boulmer and the provision of SAR from RAF Boulmer ceased. SAR is now carried out by HM Coastguard through a contract with Bristow Helicopters.

The RAF School of Aerospace Battle Management (SABM), formerly the School of Fighter Control (SFC), was located at RAF Boulmer from 1990 to 2019. The school became part of the Defence College of Air and Space Operations on its creation in April 2016. The SABM played a central part in delivering the training required for Weapons Controllers and Identification Officers of the Air Operations Branch and airmen and airwomen of the Air and Space Operations Specialists (Aerospace Systems) Trade Group. The school relocated to RAF Shawbury in Shropshire in August 2019.

In 2021, Boulmer&#x27;s Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) was allocated the No. 19 Squadron number plate.

==Based units==
The following notable flying and non-flying units are based at RAF Boulmer.

=== Royal Air Force ===
No. 2 Group

* Air Command and Control Force
** No. 1 Air Control Centre
** No. 19 Squadron – Control and Reporting Centre (NATO Air Policing Area 1)
** No. 20 Squadron – ASACS Operational Conversion Unit
** No.144 Signals Unit – ASACS engineering support

== Operations ==
RAF Boulmer&#x27;s mission statement is to &#x27;generate and sustain an operationally agile air command and control capability.&#x27;

===Air Surveillance and Control Systems Force Command===
Homeland defence of the UK remains the cornerstone of the ASACS Force Command&#x27;s operational output. However, the ASACS Force Command also has a wider responsibility in support of deployed operations worldwide. With the stand up of the ASACS Force Command Headquarters at RAF Boulmer in January 2006, the Station Commander also has the operational role of ASACS Force Commander responsible for the generation, sustainment and operational output of the ASACS organisation. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, there were 187 interceptions between 2005 and 2016.

The Force Elements under the control of the ASACS Force Commander are:
* Control and Reporting Centre – RAF Boulmer
* No. 1 Air Control Centre – RAF Boulmer
* Remote Radar Head (RRH) Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides
* RRH Saxa Vord in Shetland
* RRH Buchan in Aberdeenshire
* RRH Brizlee Wood in Northumberland
* RRH Neatishead in Norfolk
* RRH Portreath in Cornwall
* RRH Staxton Wold in North Yorkshire

Although not a Force Element, the Support Wing at RAF Boulmer is a vital cog in the machinery of the Command, without which the ASACS Force could not generate its capability. In total, the ASACS Force Command comprises some 1800 military personnel, civil servants and contracted staff.

===Control and Reporting Centre===
The Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) at RAF Boulmer, named Hotspur, is tasked with compiling a Recognised Air Picture within NATO Air Policing Area 1, and providing tactical control of the Quick Reaction Alert Force. The CRC is manned 24/7 to support NATO and national Quick Reaction Alert requirements. Managing the UK&#x27;s network-enabled capability for the Homeland Defence task, the CRC also supports the training of Air Surveillance and Control System personnel, UK and NATO partner aircrew for deployment on operations worldwide.

===Resource Management Hub===
The ASACS Force Resource Management Hub is based at RAF Boulmer. It currently employs 14 Civilian personnel, 12 located at RAF Boulmer and 2 at RAF Scampton. Its role is to provide specialist financial support &amp; guidance to the ASACS Force Command whilst ensuring value for money and compliance with RAF Air Command&#x27;s Corporate Governance policies.

===Support Wing===
Support Wing has approximately 100 service and civil servant personnel, who along with a large number of contractors support operations. The wing comprises three squadrons: Force Development Squadron which is responsible for all the key elements necessary to deliver Force Development Training, including the Training and Development Flight, Physical Education Section, Regiment Section and the Learning Centre. Personnel Management Squadron which includes Personnel Services Flight, the Service Community Support Officer, HIVE, General Duties Flight and the Medical and Dental Centres. Management Support Squadron which comprises Catering, Retail and Leisure, Estates and Facilities Management, Media and Communications and the Station i-Hub and Central Registry.

===ASACS Engineering and Logistics Squadron===
Elements of the ASACS Engineering and Logistics Squadron, which come under the control of the ASACS Force Commander (Station Commander RAF Boulmer) provide engineering support to the base.

==Other facilities==
RAF Boulmer also has a shooting range that is often used by Air Cadets of Durham / Northumberland Wing, ATC using the L98A2 Cadet GP Rifle. The station is the location of a Met Office automatic weather reporting station, used in the extended Shipping Forecast broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

<doc id="875941" wikidata="Q17140834" url="?curid=875941" title="Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth">
<text>The Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth was an upper-tier regional municipality in Ontario, Canada, that existed between January 1, 1974, and January 1, 2001. It was composed of six municipalities, centered on and including the City of Hamilton, and existed to coordinate certain shared services, such as policing and public transit, for those municipalities. It was created through the restructuring of Wentworth County, and was one of the last such governments to be created in Ontario.

The regional municipality was dissolved in 2001, and its constituent municipalities were amalgamated to form the current single-tier City of Hamilton, with a 2021 total population of 569,353.

==Overview==

Regional Municipalities were an experiment in two-tiered municipalities created between the late 1960s to mid-1970s. They existed mainly in the Golden Horseshoe of southern Ontario, but also existed in the form of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury in northern Ontario and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton in eastern Ontario. The regions were proved somewhat controversial upon their creation and the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth was one of the last created by this process. Almost immediately after its creation, some sort of merger was advocated, with &quot;Wentworth&quot; being among some of the candidate names for the new megacity, despite the City of Hamilton functioning as the metropolitan core for the Region as a whole.

The Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth was established as an Upper-Tier Municipality and comprised the bulk of the former Wentworth County, of which it replaced. Its Lower-Tier Municipalities were, in order of population, the city of Hamilton, the town (later city) of Stoney Creek, the town of Ancaster, the town of Flamborough, the town of Dundas and the township of Glanbrook.

The Region provided policing, social services, and public transit (by taking over Hamilton Street Railway), while the lower-tier provided Fire Services and Recreation Services; although, both tiers shared the responsibility for maintaining Roads and Water.
It was governed by a Regional Chair who presided over a Regional Council with representatives from each of Hamilton&#x27;s wards and two each from other constituent municipalities. Near the end of its existence, the Regional Chair was chosen by Direct Election.

==History==
The Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth was created by Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1973, which took effect on January 1, 1974. The creation of the Regional Municipality resulted in the consolidation of the former municipalities of Wentworth County into six new municipalities:

==Merger==
A different Progressive Conservative government amalgamated all of the constituent municipalities in Hamilton–Wentworth into the larger single-tier City of Hamilton in 2001, against great opposition from its suburban and rural parts. This was part of a broader series of municipal reorganizations in urban and rural Ontario, and was also the fate of Metropolitan Toronto, the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton, Chatham-Kent, Prince Edward County, and many others.

<text>Tanya Denise Tucker (born October 10, 1958) is an American country music singer and songwriter who had her first hit, &quot;Delta Dawn&quot;, in 1972 at the age of 13. During her career Tucker became one of the few child performers to mature into adulthood without losing her audience; she had a streak of top-10 and top-40 hits.
She has had several successful albums, several Country Music Association award nominations, and hit songs including 1973&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Your Mama&#x27;s Name?&quot; and &quot;Blood Red and Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Lizzie and the Rainman&quot;, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Strong Enough to Bend&quot;, and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Two Sparrows in a Hurricane&quot;. Tucker&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;While I&#x27;m Livin&#x27;&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album, and &quot;Bring My Flowers Now&quot; from that same album won Tucker a shared songwriting Grammy for Best Country Song.

Tucker’s latest album is a 2023 critically acclaimed collaboration with Brandi Carlile called &quot;Sweet Western Sound&quot;. Tucker was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on October 22, 2023.

==Early life==
Tanya Denise Tucker was born in Seminole, Texas, the youngest of three children born to Alma Juanita (née Cunningham; 1927–2012) and Jesse Melvin &quot;Beau&quot; Tucker (1927–2006). Prior to managing Tanya&#x27;s career, Beau was a heavy equipment operator, so the family moved often as he sought better work. Her early childhood was spent primarily in Willcox, Arizona, where the only radio station in town, KHIL, played country music. The Tuckers attended concerts of country stars such as Ernest Tubb and Mel Tillis, and Tanya&#x27;s sister LaCosta was praised in the family for her vocal abilities. At the age of eight, Tanya told her father that she also wanted to be a country singer when she grew up.

When the Tuckers moved to St. George, Utah, Juanita took Tanya to audition for the film &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;. Tanya did not win the bigger role for which she tried out, but she was hired, as was her horse, as a bit player. About this time, she also received one of her first musical breaks, when her father drove the family to Phoenix for the Arizona State Fair, on the chance that the featured performer, country singer Judy Lynn, could use Tanya in her show. Tanya sang for the fair&#x27;s entertainment managers, and she was engaged to sing at the fair itself.

Tucker made her debut with Mel Tillis, who was so impressed by her talent that he invited her onstage to perform. In 1969, the family moved to Henderson, Nevada, where Tucker regularly performed. Eventually, she recorded a demonstration tape that gained the attention of songwriter Dolores Fuller, who sent it to producer Billy Sherrill, the head of artists and repertoire at CBS Records. Sherrill was impressed with the demo tape and signed the teenage vocalist to Columbia Records.

==Career==
===1972–1979: Teen country star===

Sherrill initially planned to have Tucker record &quot;The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA&quot;, but she chose &quot;Delta Dawn&quot;a song Billy Sherrill heard Bette Midler sing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;instead as her first single while Donna Fargo, the writer of &quot;The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA&quot;, released her own version as a single. Released in May 1972, the song became a hit, peaking at number six on the country chart and scraping the bottom of the pop chart. At first, Columbia Records tried to downplay Tucker&#x27;s age, but soon word leaked out and she became a sensation. A year later, Australian singer Helen Reddy scored a number-one U.S. pop hit with her version of &quot;Delta Dawn&quot;.

&quot;I thank the lucky stars and the Good Lord for that song,&quot; Tucker told &quot;Nine-O-One Network Magazine&quot; in 1988. &quot;If I cut it now for the first time I think it would be a hit. I was fortunate to have latched onto that one, and that was all Sherrill&#x27;s doing. If it hadn&#x27;t been for Sherrill, I probably would have been a rodeo queen or something.&quot;

Her second single, &quot;Love&#x27;s the Answer&quot;, also became a top-10 hit later in 1972. Tucker&#x27;s third single, &quot;What&#x27;s Your Mama&#x27;s Name&quot;, became her first number-one hit in the spring of 1973. Two other number ones&quot;Blood Red and Goin&#x27; Down&quot; and &quot;Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)&quot; followed, establishing Tucker as a major star.

In 1975, she signed with MCA Records, where she had a string of hit singles that ran into the late 1970s.

Among these hits was &quot;Lizzie and the Rainman&quot;, which became a number-one country hit, and also became Tucker&#x27;s only top-40 pop music hit, peaking at number 37. It also peaked among the top 10 on the adult contemporary charts at the time. Tucker has a string of top-10 country hits under MCA between 1975 and 1978, including &quot;San Antonio Stroll&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Some Love&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s a Cowboy Lovin&#x27; Night&quot;.

In 1977, she recorded &quot;You Taught Me How to Cry,&quot; a duet with Hoyt Axton on his album &quot;Snowblind Friend.&quot;

In 1978, she decided to radically change her image and cross over to rock with her &quot;TNT&quot; album. Despite the controversy over the record and its sexy cover, it went gold the following year.

The two hit singles from the album were &quot;I&#x27;m a Singer, You&#x27;re the Song&quot;, and &quot;Texas (When I Die)&quot;. The latter reached number five on the country charts, and its B-side, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, a Buddy Holly cover, peaked at number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100.

===1979–1984: Sales decline and personal battles===
By the end of the 1970s, her sales were decliningin 1980 she only had two hits, one of them was &quot;Can I See You Tonight?&quot;. Also in 1980, she recorded a few singles with Glen Campbell, with whom she was romantically linked. In addition to recording, she also made her feature-film debut in &quot;Hard Country&quot;, although she did have small roles in &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; (1972) and the television miniseries &quot;The Rebels&quot; (1979).

She also had begun drinking in her late teens, and she explained how it started: 

&quot;You send your ass out on the road doing two gigs a night and after all that adoration go back to empty hotel rooms. Loneliness got me into it.&quot; 

In 1978, Tucker moved to Los Angeles to try, unsuccessfully, to broaden her appeal to pop audiences, and was quickly captivated by the city&#x27;s nightlife. She also said that she &quot;was the wildest thing out there. I could stay up longer, drink more and kick the biggest ass in town. I was on the ragged edge.&quot;

Despite having a top 10 hit in March 1983 (&quot;Feel Right&quot;) from her first and only Arista album &quot;Changes&quot;, she struggled to have her music played on the radio. By mid-1983, her singles were no longer making the top 40.

She moved to Nashville after her breakup with Campbell in 1982 and began to lead a more secluded life. Finally, in 1988, her family confronted her and persuaded her to enter the Betty Ford Center.

===1986–1997: Comeback===
In 1986, Tucker signed with Capitol Records; she returned to the charts with &quot;One Love at a Time&quot;, which climbed to number three. Her career was revitalized with 1986&#x27;s &quot;Girls Like Me&quot;, an album that spawned four top-10 country singles. In 1988, she had three number-one country singles: &quot;I Won&#x27;t Take Less Than Your Love&quot; (with Paul Davis and Paul Overstreet), &quot;If It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, and &quot;Strong Enough to Bend&quot;.

Her music was now more country pop-styled and up-tempo, but this material made Tucker popular again. Between 1988 and 1989, Tucker enjoyed one of her most popular years on the charts, racking up eight country top-10 hits in a row. Her albums around this time were also achieving &quot;Gold&quot; certifications by the RIAA, after selling 500,000 copies. A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album followed in 1989. It also contained a new single called &quot;My Arms Stay Open All Night&quot;. Radio responded well; the song peaked at number two.

In 1988, Tucker was nominated by the Country Music Association for &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot;, and was nominated for other major awards during this time. Her contribution to the country music genre was rewarded when the Country Music Association voted her the &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; in 1991, though she missed the event, having just given birth to her second child. Eight consecutive singles reached the top 10 in the early 1990s, including &quot;Down to My Last Teardrop&quot;, &quot;(Without You) What Do I Do with Me&quot;, and &quot;Two Sparrows in a Hurricane&quot;. In 1990, Tucker was named &quot;Female Video Artist of the Year&quot; by CMT. Although by the 1990s, she no longer had number-one hits, many singles came close peaking in the country top five, as well as the top 10. Tucker was one of the most successful female country artists at the time. She became one of the few teen stars to find success in her adult years.

Her 1993 album &quot;Greatest Hits 1990-1992&quot; rose to number 15, and also went to number 18 on the Top Country Albums chart. Liberty Records was changed to Capitol Nashville in 1994.

By the 1990s, Tucker was a 20-year veteran in country music, though she was only in her mid-30s. In 1994, &quot;Hangin&#x27; In&quot; was her last top-five hit, as well as her last top-10 hit for a while. That year, she performed at the half-time show at Super Bowl XXVIII. In 1996, she was one of the top-10 most-played artists of the year, and at the time was also Capitol Records&#x27; biggest signed female artist. In 1997, she returned to the top 10 on the country charts for the last time with the hit, &quot;Little Things&quot;, which peaked at number nine. That year she was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.

===2000–present: Music career today===
In 2002, Tucker founded Tuckertime Records, allowing her to retain control of the recording process and release the singles she wished to release. The same year, she issued &quot;Tanya&quot;, her first album in five years, which was distributed through Capitol Records.

In 2002, Tucker was ranked number 20 on CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Women of Country Music. In 2005, she released an album, &quot;Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;. In 2005, she also contributed two songs to a tribute album to Bob Wills, called &quot;A Tribute to Bob Wills 100th Anniversary&quot;. In 2005, she released a book, &quot;100 Ways to Beat the Blues on Fireside&quot;, which included tips on shaking the blues, from some of Tucker&#x27;s friends such as Willie Nelson, Brenda Lee, Little Richard, and Burt Reynolds.

Tucker recorded an album, &quot;Lonesome Town&quot;, around 2007, but it has never been released. The same year, she recorded a live concert at the Renaissance Center in December. Tucker also sang a duet with country music artist Billy Joe Shaver, of Shaver&#x27;s song, &quot;Played the Game Too Long&quot;, on his album, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Brother&quot;, released in September 2007.

In 2009, Tucker signed a one-time deal with Saguaro Road Records from Time-Life. Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Lonesome Town&quot; project was put on hold to do the first cover album of her career, &quot;My Turn&quot;, which was released in June 2009 and placed number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. The first single, &quot;Love&#x27;s Gonna Live Here&quot;, was released to radio and was also available as a digital single. It is a remake of the classic hit by Buck Owens. The album includes classic country hits such as &quot;Wine Me Up&quot;, &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Fever&quot;, &quot;Walk Through This World With Me&quot;, &quot;Big Big Love&quot;, &quot;Crazy Arms&quot;, &quot;After The Fire Is Gone&quot;, and &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot;.

Tucker appeared on Terri Clark&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Classic&quot; in a remake duet of her first single &quot;Delta Dawn&quot;.

In June 2017, Tucker was featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time.

After the death of former flame Glen Campbell on August 8, 2017, Tucker released her first single since 2009, &quot;Forever Loving You&quot;, a song co-penned by Tennessee State Senator Rusty Crowe. The song&#x27;s release the following day, on the eve of Campbell&#x27;s funeral, drew ire and criticism being exploitative. Tucker claimed that a portion of the proceeds will benefit the Alzheimer&#x27;s Foundation of America, but the foundation stated it was not involved in the promotion and has not received any funds.

Tucker released &quot;While I&#x27;m Livin&#x27;&quot;, her first collection of original material since 2002&#x27;s &quot;Tanya&quot;, in 2019 via Fantasy Records. It was produced by Shooter Jennings and Brandi Carlile, with Carlile brought onto the project after initially being approached for songs by Jennings but after having professed such an admiration of Tucker and her work, Jennings felt it necessary for her to co-produce the record alongside him. Tucker performed &quot;Bring My Flowers Now&quot; at Loretta Lynn&#x27;s all-star 87th birthday concert at Nashville&#x27;s Bridgestone Arena with Carlile playing piano. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hard Luck&quot;, was released on June 28, along with its accompanying music video.

On January 26, 2020, Tanya Tucker won her first two Grammy Awards for &quot;Bring My Flowers Now&quot; and &quot;While I&#x27;m Livin&#x27;&quot;. Tucker released a live album, Live from the Troubadour on October 16, 2020. In a 2021 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Tucker revealed that she was working on a follow-up to &quot;While I&#x27;m Livin&quot;&#x27; with Carlile and Jennings. Tucker collaborated with RuPaul for &quot;This is Our Country&quot; in September 2021.

During her 2022 set at Stagecoach Festival, Tucker revealed completing a new album. Tanya announced her studio album &quot;Sweet Western Sound&quot; on April 5, 2023, releasing the first single, &quot;Kindness&quot;. &quot;Sweet Western Sound&quot; was produced by Tucker along with Brandi Carlile and Shooter Jennings, and released June 2, 2023, on Fantasy Records.

===Outlaw image===
Tucker is one of the few and best-known female country singers to be classified as an &quot;Outlaw&quot; in the Outlaw country movement, which was most popular in the late 1970s. As Tucker matured by the end of the 1970s, her Outlaw image grew. Like the other Outlaw artists in the business at the time (Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, Emmylou Harris, David Allan Coe, Hank Williams Jr.), Tucker was able to combine qualities of country and rock music into her voice to make the Outlaw sound that was popular at the time. These qualities could be heard on some of her biggest hits at the time, including 1978&#x27;s &quot;Texas (When I Die)&quot;. Tucker also had a spirit of independence, which was another Outlaw quality. She ranked number nine on CMT Greatest Outlaws: The Dirty Dozen, the only woman to appear on that list.

As the 1980s progressed, Tucker continued to add the Outlaw qualities to her hits. At the beginning of the 1990s, Tucker was still identified as an Outlaw. Today, Tucker continues to be recognized as one, regularly attending Outlaw events among regular shows. Gretchen Wilson made reference to Tucker in her 2004 hit song &quot;Redneck Woman&quot;, and Tucker appears briefly in the video of the song, showing Tucker with other Outlaws.

==&quot;The Return of Tanya Tucker&quot;==
Decades after Tucker slipped from the spotlight, musician Brandi Carlile collaborated with her on an album, as well as a documentary based on Tucker&#x27;s life.

&quot;The Return of Tanya Tucker: Featuring Brandi Carlile&quot; was released in New York and Los Angeles on October 21, 2022, and nationwide on November 4. It was accompanied by the track &quot;Ready As I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot;.

==Other works==
Tucker appeared as a celebrity judge on &quot;Dance Fever&quot; in 1979.

She published a 1997 autobiography, &quot;Nickel Dreams: My Life&quot;.

She starred in her own reality show, &quot;Tuckerville&quot;, on TLC in 2005. It ran for two seasons for 18 episodes. The show covers an in-depth visit with Tucker in her home with her family.

Tucker continues to perform for the military doing benefits with newer country acts such as Eric Agnew and Cole Deggs &amp; the Lonesome. 

In 2019, she launched her own brand of tequila called Cosa Salvaje.

==Personal life==
Tucker had a relationship with Glen Campbell in the early 1980s. She also dated Merle Haggard, Andy Gibb, and Don Johnson.

She later had a relationship with actor Ben Reed, with whom she had daughter Presley Tanita (b. July 5, 1989) and son Beau &quot;Grayson&quot; (b. October 2, 1991).

Tucker has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Jerry Laseter, a Nashville musician. They were engaged in 1997 and again in 1999. Just days before their 1999 wedding, Tucker canceled the ceremony when she discovered she was pregnant with her third child, Tucker&#x27;s daughter Layla LaCosta (b. June 25, 1999), saying she did not want to walk down the aisle pregnant in her wedding dress. Laseter was co-producer of Tucker&#x27;s albums in 2002 (&quot;Tanya&quot;), 2005 (&quot;Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;), and 2009 (&quot;My Turn&quot;).

Tucker&#x27;s brother is Don (deceased) and her sister is country singer La Costa.

In 2022, Tucker sold her Brentwood, Tennessee, home (purchased three years earlier for $1,510,000) for $2,275,000.

<doc id="875943" wikidata="Q1939224" url="?curid=875943" title="Penny stock">
<text>Penny stocks are common shares of small public companies that trade for less than five dollars per share.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses the term &quot;Penny stock&quot; to refer to a security, a financial instrument which represents a given financial value, issued by small public companies that trade at less than $5 per share. Penny stocks are priced over-the-counter, rather than on the trading floor. The term &quot;penny stock&quot; refers to shares that, prior to the SEC&#x27;s classification, traded for &quot;pennies on the dollar&quot;.
In 1934, when the United States government passed the Securities Exchange Act to regulate any and all transactions of securities between parties which are &quot;not the original issuer&quot;, the SEC at the time disclosed that equity securities which trade for less than $5 per share could not be listed on any national stock exchange or index.

==Trade==
Over-the-counter exchanges that list penny stocks include the OTC Bulletin Board (which is a facility of FINRA) or OTC Link LLC (which is owned by OTC Markets Group, Inc., formerly known as Pink OTC Markets Inc.). Penny stocks can also trade on securities exchanges, including foreign securities exchanges. Penny stocks can include the securities of certain private companies with no active trading market.
==Risk and investment==
When considering penny stocks, investors and experts in the field recognize the low market price of shares and its correlation to low market capitalization. Market capitalization or &quot;market cap&quot; is the total dollar market value of all of a company’s outstanding securities.

Since penny stocks are inexpensive, investors often buy large quantities of shares without spending much money. This tendency makes the penny stock market volatile. Volatility is &quot;a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index&quot;. Typically, the higher the volatility, the greater the risk in investing in said securities. Conversely, the lower the volatility, the &quot;safer&quot; the investment is. Volatility can be also understood as the frequency of large changes in the value of a given security in either direction. This is directly correlated to the price action of a security which, when talking about penny stocks, can change more rapidly than that of a large-cap stock.

==Fraud==

Prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation say that fraud is widespread in the penny stock market. Potential fraud that involves even what are considered very small or micro market cap companies can still involve losses of tens of millions of dollars.

The penny stock market has little liquidity, so holders of shares in penny stock companies often find it difficult to cash out of positions. However, academic research shows that the risk created by small market cap size and lower liquidity results in higher expected returns due to the size and liquidity premiums.

In the United States, the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have specific rules to define and regulate the sale of penny stocks.

==Concerns for investors==
There are inherent concerns that individuals should be aware of when investing in penny stocks, namely the lack of information that often exists surrounding the companies offering said stocks. The lack of public reporting mixed with a thin market is often the perfect recipe for stock manipulation via stock promoters. A common practice is for these individuals to purchase large quantities of stock and then utilize promoters to artificially inflate the sub-penny stock’s share price, through false and misleading information. When the liquidity and price increase, the manipulator will sell their known as a &quot;pump and dump&quot; which is a form of microcap stock fraud.

On April 3, 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported on a story in which penny stock fraud was the focal point of the piece. According to the article, California resident Zirk de Maison was found guilty of conducting a &quot;pump and dump&quot; scheme, during the course of which de Maison and his associates convinced large groups of investors to purchase shares of companies that he had set up as shell organizations.

From 2008 to 2013, de Maison created five small public companies which, unbeknownst to the investing public, did no actual business and had no legitimate assets. Once he set these companies up, he offered public shares of the company’s penny stocks for investors to purchase.

According to the FBI investigation, de Maison would use fictitious names to convince investors to purchase shares of his shell companies, thus driving up the price of his shares and giving the illusion that investors were realizing profit. Once these prices went up, de Maison and his original conspirators would then liquidate their shares at the stock&#x27;s highest level, and this mass selling caused the shares to drop dramatically, leaving investors with near-worthless shares.

In more sophisticated versions of the fraud, individuals or organizations buy millions of shares, then use newsletter websites, chat rooms, stock message boards, fake press releases, or e-mail blasts to drive up interest in the stock. Very often, the perpetrator will claim to have &quot;inside&quot; information about impending news to persuade the unwitting investor to quickly buy the shares. When buying pressure pushes the share price up, the rise in price entices more people to believe the hype and to buy shares as well. Eventually the manipulators doing the &quot;pumping&quot; end up &quot;dumping,&quot; when they sell their holdings.

The expanding use of the Internet and personal communication devices has made penny stock scams easier to perpetrate. Since the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission allowed for the use of social media outlets like Twitter to disclose public information in lieu of press services, many fraudsters have set up accounts to take advantage of this higher level of traffic on social media, giving investors another thing to consider when searching for viable sources of information.

===Notable cases===
The Mafia had infiltrated Wall Street by the 1970s. In the 1980s Lorenzo Formato conducted penny-stock manipulations. Formato testified in Congressional hearings that during the years he promoted and sold penny stocks, he was involved in organized crime, and testified to rampant penny stock manipulation by organized crime. The Congressional hearings led to passage of the Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990.

By 1989, American investors were being cheated out of at least $2 billion a year by schemes involving penny stocks.

Mob activity on Wall Street reportedly increased in the 1990s. On February 10, 1997, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Mafia crime families are switching increasingly to white collar crimes&quot; with a focus on &quot;small Wall Street brokerage houses.&quot;

In May 1997, an FBI sting operation led to charges against Louis Malpeso Jr., a reported Colombo crime family associate, for conspiring to commit securities fraud with stock broker Joseph DiBella and Robert Cattogio to inflate the price of penny stock &quot;First Colonial Ventures&quot;. All three defendants pled guilty.

Another example of an activity that skirts the borderline between legitimate promotion and hype is the case of LEXG. Lithium Exploration Group&#x27;s market capitalization soared to over $350 million after an extensive direct mail campaign. The promotion drew upon the legitimate growth in production and use of lithium, while touting Lithium Exploration Group&#x27;s position within that sector. According to the company&#x27;s December 31, 2010, form 10-Q (filed within months of the direct mail promotion), LEXG was a lithium company without assets. Its revenues and assets at that time were zero. Subsequently, the company did acquire lithium production/exploration properties, and addressed concerns raised in the press.

The &quot;pump and dump&quot; tactic is also known as a supernova and, unlike regular stocks, penny stocks usually move on momentum of the price action.

One of the biggest penny stock operators in the 1950s was Tellier &amp; Co. In the 1980s, major penny stock brokerages included Blinder Robinson (nicknamed &quot;Blind&#x27;em and Rob&#x27;em&quot;), First Jersey Securities, Rooney Pace, and Stuart-James. Major penny stock brokerages operating in the 1990s included Stratton Oakmont, Sterling Foster, A.S. Goldmen, and Hanover Sterling.

==Regulation==
In the United States, regulators have defined a penny stock as a security that meets a number of specific standards. The criteria include price, market capitalization, and minimum shareholder equity. Securities traded on a national stock exchange, regardless of price, are exempt from regulatory designation as a penny stock, since it is thought that exchange-traded securities are less vulnerable to manipulation. Therefore, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and other NYSE-listed securities which traded below $1.00 during the market downturn of 2008–09, while properly regarded as &quot;low-priced&quot; securities, were not technically &quot;penny stocks&quot;.

Although penny stock trading in the United States is now primarily controlled through rules and regulations enforced by the SEC and FINRA, the genesis of this control is found in State securities law. The State of Georgia was the first state to codify a comprehensive penny stock securities law. Secretary of State Max Cleland, whose office enforced State securities laws, was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative Chesley V. Morton, the only stockbroker in the Georgia General Assembly at the time, was principal sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Georgia&#x27;s penny stock law was subsequently challenged in court. However, the law was eventually upheld in U.S. District Court, and the statute became the template for laws enacted in other states. Shortly thereafter, both FINRA and the SEC enacted comprehensive revisions of their penny stock regulations.

These regulations proved effective in closing or greatly restricting broker/dealers, such as Blinder, Robinson &amp; Company, which specialized in the penny stocks sector. Meyer Blinder was jailed for securities fraud in 1992, after the collapse of his firm.

<doc id="875949" wikidata="Q6571781" url="?curid=875949" title="List of German Jews">
<text>The first Jewish population in the region to be later known as Germany came with the Romans to the city now known as Cologne. A &quot;Golden Age&quot; in the first millennium saw the emergence of the Ashkenazi Jews, while the persecution and expulsion that followed the Crusades led to the creation of Yiddish and an overall shift eastwards. A change of status in the late Renaissance Era, combined with the Jewish Enlightenment, the Haskalah, meant that by the 1920s Germany had one of the most integrated Jewish populations in Europe, contributing prominently to German culture and society.
During The Holocaust many Jews fled Germany to other countries for refuge, and the majority of the remaining population were killed.

<doc id="875956" wikidata="Q15621" url="?curid=875956" title="Esplugues de Llobregat">
<text>Esplugues de Llobregat () is a municipality of the Barcelona metropolitan area. Formerly in the &quot;Barcelonès&quot;, since 1990 it has been part of the comarca of Baix Llobregat. During recent decades Esplugues has evolved from a predominantly industrial town to a more diverse service area, preserving, however, its cultural and historical identity.

It is known for its characteristic old quarter, the only one in the Baix Llobregat area with such evocative and romantic areas. The winding &quot;Carrer de Montserrat&quot; goes through the sprawling architectural complex built between 1968 and 2017 by sculptor Xavier Corberó. The mansion of &quot;Can Cortada&quot; was home to the Baron Maldà, author of Calaix de Sastre, the most representative work of Catalan literature of the late 18th century. Esplugues holds a remarkable natural area with parks and green spaces such as the Park of Solidarity, the Park of Torrents and the Can Vidalet Park. From the mountain of Sant Pere Màrtir, it is possible to enjoy a picturesque viewpoint of the entire town.

The German School of Barcelona and the American School of Barcelona are located in town and attract wealthy expatriate families. Due to its proximity to the Camp Nou stadium, many famous footballers reside in Esplugues, such as Gerard Piqué, Andrés Iniesta, and Dani Alves, as well as the motorcycle racer Sete Gibernau, the former World Number 1 tennis player Arantxa Sánchez, and other personalities in Spanish showbiz.

== City connection ==
Esplugues de Llobregat has an excellent road network, being connected to the highways B-20 and B-23, the N-340 road, and its location right across from the Avinguda Diagonal, the most important avenue in Barcelona. The city resides away from the Airport of Barcelona, it is away from the port of Barcelona, and away to the Catalan capital downtown.

It is linked to Barcelona through the following bus lines: 57, 63, 67, 68, 157, metropolitan buses, and T1, T2 and T3 Trambaix lines. The only metro station in the area is Can Vidalet, on the L5 line. Two other stops are under construction and will be opened in 2018.

==History==
The first nominal legal land section, a little portion of land with a few homes and a few inhabitants, in what is today Esplugues was made in 1096. The first documents which talk about a town called Esplugues de Llobregat date from the 14th century.

== Demography ==
The municipality has a population of 46,447.

<doc id="875957" wikidata="Q6422364" url="?curid=875957" title="Knighton, Leicester">
<text>Knighton is a residential suburban area of Leicester, England. It situated between Clarendon Park to the north, Stoneygate to the east, Oadby and Wigston to the south and the Saffron Lane estate to the west.

Originally a separate village a couple of miles from Leicester city centre, it became linked to it by the areas known as Stoneygate and Clarendon Park during the Victorian period, due to the demand for housing for those newly employed in industry. It still retains several of the village&#x27;s original buildings, such as Oram Cottage and the Church of St. Mary Magdalen; the village core is now a conservation area.

==Population==
The population at the 2011 census was 16,805. but the Knighton census ward differs significantly from the Knighton neighbourhood area. A portion of Stoneygate is included. The ancient parish had a population of 383 in 1831, rising to 6,075 by 1891, after the first wave of Leicester&#x27;s Victorian expansion into the northern part of the parish. Knighton itself saw much building in the 1930s and 1940s with red-brick semi-detached houses. The village as a suburb expanded further in the mid-20th century with the building of the housing estates of West Knighton and South Knighton. These two estates have a mix of housing of the post-war era.

==History==
Knighton was named in the Domesday Book of 1086 (where it is spelled &quot;Cnihetone&quot;, and gives a picture of a fairly large village of 24 households and substantial farmlands, all under the manorial lordship of the Bishop of Lincoln, who at that time was a Norman cleric named Remigius de Fécamp. It functioned as a civil parish between Leicester and Wigston Magna, with an identity separate from the town of Leicester until the end of the 19th century. Ecclesiastically, it was a chapelry of St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Leicester and appears to have been so since before the Norman conquest. Both St Margaret&#x27;s, Leicester and St Mary Magdelene, Knighton, were held by the Bishop of Lincoln, and from the 13th century St Margaret&#x27;s was a prebendary church of Lincoln Cathedral, and thus had considerable autonomy compared to Leicester&#x27;s other ecclesiastical parishes, which were all held by Leicester Abbey. The tithes and glebe lands at Knighton were thus in the hands of the vicar of St Margaret&#x27;s. Although Knighton Church dates back to at least the 13th century, it was served by a curate, and did not have its own vicar until it was made a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1878.

The medieval parish had four substantial open fields, and the village economy was centred on agricultural activity. Until the Enclosure award of 1756 these four open fields, named Stockwell, Safforn, Goldhill, and the Breach Field, were subdivided into narrow strips that were allocated annually amongst the families in the village. These fields were enclosed in 1756 and divided up permanently between the 14 families that had rights to the land, giving a snapshot of the spread of wealth in the village. were allocated, in proportion to the size of each family&#x27;s existing rights. The Craddock family, who by this time were the Lords of the Manor, received almost 700 acres. Of the other families, Edward Inge received 260 acres, the Foster and Johnson families each received well over 100 acres, leaving the other 10 families to share 300 acres between them.

===Growth of Stoneygate===

Knighton retained its agricultural character into the 19th century, whilst Leicester to the north and Wigston to the south were becoming centres of the framework knitting cottage industry. The first effects of the expansion of Leicester were felt, not in the village itself, but in the area of the parish that became known as Stoneygate. Suburban development had its beginnings in the 1770s and 80s with a substantial private dwelling called Stoneygate House, on what later became Toller Road, followed by the conversion of a farmhouse on the Harborough Turnpike, (now London Road) into a &#x27;gentleman&#x27;s residence&#x27; called The Stoney Gate. By the 1840s there were 10 houses strung along the London Road, occupied by some of Leicester&#x27;s most prosperous tradesmen and industrialists. The trend of wealthy clients getting a house built for their own use continued up to 1863, by which time there were 32 such spacious mansions. From 1865 the side roads began to be opened up, developed by speculative builders, and a more rapid expansion and infilling got underway.

===Clarendon Park===

From 1875 the estate that had formerly been The Breach Field, in Knighton&#x27;s open field days, began to be sold off for development. The density of housing was greater than in Stoneygate, and many streets were laid out with rows of brick terraces, and acquired the name Clarendon Park, apparently as a marketing device. By 1888 Clarendon Park&#x27;s road layout was substantially complete and built up. Queen&#x27;s Road and Clarendon Park Road were provided with shops and other community facilities. Large, well-funded churches were rapidly established both in Clarendon Park and to a lesser extent Stoneygate. Among these were St John the Baptist Anglican Church (1885), London Road Congregational (1886), Queen&#x27;s Road Primitive Methodist (1887), Clarendon Park Road Baptist (1894), St. Michael and All Angels Anglican (1898), Clarendon Park Road Wesleyan Methodist (1901 replacing an 1886 mission hall), Salvation Army (1901) and Stoneygate Baptist (1905).

===Boundary changes===
The historic parish occupied a broad swathe of land on the southern border of Leicester. From Safron lane in the west, it was roughly wide, extending to the Gartree Road in the east.

Knighton was formerly a chapelry in St. Margaret parish, from 1866 Knighton was a civil parish in its own right until it was abolished on 26 March 1896 and merged with Leicester.

==Knighton Park==
Knighton Park forms the southern part of the neighbourhood, south of the A563 Palmerston Way. The park was bought from the Craddock-Hartopp trustees by Leicester city council in the late 1930s but wartime prevented its conversion to a public park until 1953. The various compartments and zones within the Park still reflect many of the divisions of the land put in place in 1756 for agricultural improvements when the Knighton open fields were enclosed and subdivided for the first time.

Knighton Spinney is a small area of woodland on the north-east side of the Park, in extent, that was declared a Local Nature Reserve in 2003. It was planted as a mix of oak and ash trees by Squire Craddock-Hartopp in 1840, as he was concerned about the lack of oaks for shipbuilding. With the shift to iron ships, they were never needed for this purpose, but the spinney was used as a covert for foxhunting. By 1932 the Craddocks could see its wildlife value and covenanted it as a wildlife reserve for all time. It now has a diverse woodland structure, and provides a valuable habitat for spring woodland flowers, birds, mammals and insects.

The park was first awarded the Green Flag Award in 2005. It has a range of amenities, including two play areas, tennis courts, pitch &amp; put (seasonal opening), sensory garden, heath garden. The Wash Brook runs through the park.

==St Thomas More&#x27;s Catholic Church==

The parish of St Thomas More was formed in 1947 and the church was designed in 1948 by the architects Reynolds &amp; Scott, who built a number of parishes in the Diocese of Nottingham. The church was designed in a stripped basilican style. The broad west tower is a recognisable local landmark due to its distinctive nature. Whilst there were a number of Catholic churches within Leicester at the time of the church&#x27;s construction, St Thomas More&#x27;s was the first to be built to serve the community of Knighton. The foundation stone was laid by Bishop Edward Ellis, Bishop of Nottingham, in 1950. The church was officially opened for use in 1952. The design incorporated a domed baldacchino over the altar and altar rails, all of which have been removed. At the time of the re-ordering which removed the baldacchino, a parish hall was built adjacent to the church. Stained glass windows along the nave of the church include references to key elements of the Roman Catholic faith, with symbolic representations of Christ&#x27;s ministry and a number of the sacraments.

In the late 1990s to modernise and to make the church suitable to the reforms implemented during the Second Vatican Council the baldacchino, traditional altar, altar rail and marble lectern were replaced with mosaics implanted into the floor of the sanctuary, a mosaic cross was installed in the confessional and new decorational pieces were placed above the new, unusual octagonal altar.

==Notable people==
*Henry Knighton: wrote a history of England from the Norman conquest until 1396, the year he died.
*Sir William Lindsay Everard: MP, brewer and pioneer aviator.
*Clare Hollingworth: journalist and first person to alert the world that World War II had started

<doc id="875961" wikidata="Q6818605" url="?curid=875961" title="Mercury Communications">
<text>Mercury Communications was a national telephone company in the United Kingdom, formed in 1981 as a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless, to challenge the then-monopoly of British Telecom (BT). Although it proved only moderately successful at challenging BT&#x27;s dominance, it led the way for new communication companies to attempt the same.

In 1997, Mercury ceased to exist as a brand after its amalgamation into the operations of Cable &amp; Wireless.

==History==

===Background: before 1981===

The history of telecommunications in the United Kingdom starts in 1879, with the establishment of its first telephone exchange in London by The Telephone Company (Bells Patents) Ltd. On 10 March 1881, National Telephone Company (NTC) was formed, which later brought together smaller local telephone companies. In 1898, to break the near-monopoly held by NTC, the Postmaster General&#x27;s office, which was in charge of licensing new telephone companies, issued thirteen new licences. But by 1911, five of the remaining six competitors had been taken over by either the General Post Office (GPO) or NTC. Under the Telephone Transfer Act 1911, NTC was taken over by the GPO in 1912, and created a state-run monopoly that would run nearly all telecommunication assets in the UK for the next seventy years.

During the 1920s, there was increasing competition from companies using radio communications such as Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company. In 1928, it was decided that all telecommunication assets outside the UK, and within the British Empire, particularly the telegraph companies, should be merged into one operating company. The merged entity was initially known as the Imperial and International Communications company, and from 1934 as Cable &amp; Wireless.

Following the Labour Party&#x27;s victory in the 1945 general election, the government announced its intention to nationalise Cable and Wireless, which was carried out in 1947. The company remained government-owned, continuing to own assets and operating telecommunication services outside the UK. All assets in the UK were integrated with those of the General Post Office, which operated the UK&#x27;s domestic telecommunications monopoly.

In October 1969, the Post Office (a public corporation) replaced the General Post Office (a government department). In October 1981, the Post Office was split into two separate public corporations, the Post Office and British Telecommunications. In 1981, the Thatcher government started the process of privatising nearly all state-run monopolies, including British Telecommunications, British Airways, British Steel Corporation and British Aerospace. The act also started the privatisation of Cable &amp; Wireless, whose primary business was then in Hong Kong.

===Mercury: 1981–97===
In 1981, Mercury Communications Ltd – a consortium of Cable &amp; Wireless, Barclays, and BP – was founded as an experiment in telecommunications competition, primarily to compete with British Telecom. Its first chairperson was Sir Michael Edwardes, known for his success in turning around British Leyland. Mercury Communications was first licensed in 1982, and became a full Public Telecommunications Operator in 1984. The same year, Cable &amp; Wireless bought out the stakes of its partners.

In 1989, Mercury formed a consortium with Motorola and Shaye Communications to run Callpoint, a Telepoint-based nationwide mobile phone service. It could not successfully compete with cellular telephone technology and closed in June 1991.

In July 1991, Mercury&#x27;s sister concern, Mercury Personal Communications Network (PCN) Ltd, was awarded one of the licences to develop and build a personal communications network (PCN) in the United Kingdom. The other two went to Microtel Communications (later Orange), and Unitel. PCNs were envisaged to be superior to the then-existent cellular phone technology, giving customers the flexibility to make or take calls in the home or car, in an aeroplane, or while on holiday.

In November 1992, Cable &amp; Wireless sold a 20% stake for about £480 million to the Canadian company BCE, the parent company of Bell Canada International, which brought much-needed telecommunications expertise to Mercury. BCE also owned two cable companies in the UK.

One2One was established as the trading name of Mercury Personal Communications, a joint venture partnership equally owned by Cable &amp; Wireless and US West International, a division of US WEST Media Group. One2One introduced Britain&#x27;s first 1800 MHz GSM network in 1993, in competition with the existing mobile networks of Vodafone and Cellnet.

Mercury forged strategic alliances with 16 UK cable companies, which enabled them to offer both telephone and television services to their customers. By the end of January 1993, over 117,000 telephone lines were supplied to cable operators by Mercury. In October 1996, Mercury was merged with three cable operators in the UK (Vidéotron, Nynex and Bell Cable media) and renamed Cable &amp; Wireless Communications (in which Cable &amp; Wireless plc owned a 53% stake); the Mercury brand then ceased to be used.

Following this, the group embarked on a major disposal programme, selling One2One to T-Mobile in 1999, and selling its stake in CWC&#x27;s consumer operations to NTL (now Virgin Media) in 2000.

==Operations==
===Payphones and mobiles===
From 1986 Mercury operated public payphones in the UK, in competition with BT. These proved not to be profitable and this interest was sold in 1995. They were notable for their varied designs which imitated architectural styles.

Mercury also operated the first GSM 1800 mobile phone service, launched in 1993 as Mercury One2one. The service was first rolled out in the London area bounded by the M25, and offered free mobile to landline calls at off-peak times, weekends and Bank Holidays. Calls could be made free to landlines in the area the mobile was in, and to adjacent landline exchange codes. Even after this plan ceased being sold, SIM cards that were subscribed to the plan continued to provide these free calls, and often changed hands for large sums of money. Coverage was extended throughout the decade, with most of the UK having service by 1997. One2One was sold to Deutsche Telekom in 1999 for £8.4bn, and was rebranded as T-Mobile in 2002.

===Fixed-line phone services===
Mercury began by offering fixed-line facilities direct to business and residential customers. Callers could use the &#x27;Mercury 2300&#x27; service via their existing BT phone line by dialling a &#x27;131&#x27; prefix followed by a ten-digit customer code, then the number they wished to dial. Some phones were manufactured with a &#x27;Mercury button&#x27; which allowed the prefix and customer code to be stored and then dialled with a single button press.

Later, a more modern indirect service was introduced which required only the dialling of an access code (132) and the destination number. Mercury also provided backbone services to the emerging British cable operators which were beginning to offer their own fixed-line telephone services.

Mercury moved into the Private Branch eXchange market in 1990 as a result of Telephone Rentals being bought by Cable &amp; Wireless. This enabled the Smart Box to be connected to a large number of TR&#x27;s customers, so traffic was routed away from BT onto Mercury&#x27;s network. Mercury pulled out of the PABX market in 1996, when it sold that part of the business to Siemens, creating Siemens Business Communication Systems (SBCS), which later became Siemens Communications.

In 1997 the Mercury brand ceased to be and it was amalgamated into Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. The consumer arm of the latter would eventually be bought out by the telecommunications firm NTL in 1999, and then sold on to Npower in 2001 before the service was withdrawn entirely some years later.

Its name lives on through its original sponsorship of the Mercury Music Prize, now sponsored by Free Now.

<doc id="875962" wikidata="Q631765" url="?curid=875962" title="Wedding Album">
<text>Wedding Album is the third and final in a succession of three collaborative experimental albums by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It followed &quot;Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions&quot;. In Britain, the album was released credited by &quot;John and Yoko&quot;, without last names mentioned. In the United States, it was released credited by &quot;John Ono Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono Lennon.&quot;

==Recording==
&quot;John &amp; Yoko&quot;, the first side, a recording made on 22 and 27 April 1969, is of Lennon and Ono calling out each other&#x27;s names, through a range of volume, tempos, and emotions, over the sound of their heartbeats. The two recorded on individual microphones. Lennon described the heartbeats as being &quot;like African drums&quot;, and the piece being &quot;like an extended, very extreme &quot;John and Marsha&quot; that was out years ago by Stan Freberg. It really makes your hair stand on end.&quot; Lennon edited the two together on 1 May 1969.

&quot;Amsterdam&quot;, the second side, had been recorded first, in a hotel room at the Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam, the Netherlands during 25–31 March 1969. The piece consists of interviews explaining their campaign for peace, conversations and captured sounds during the couple&#x27;s &quot;Bed-In&quot; honeymoon. An early form of what would become &quot;John John Let&#x27;s Hope for Peace&quot; forms the beginning of &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. There were also four other musical interludes including Lennon performing a blues-style composition on acoustic guitar, featuring the words &quot;Goodbye Amsterdam Goodbye&quot;. Ono sings &quot;Grow Your Hair&quot;, a song regarding peace. Lennon sings a brief excerpt in &quot;a cappella&quot; of the Beatles song &quot;Good Night&quot;. The last interlude is a short recitation of the words &quot;Bed peace&quot; and &quot;Hair peace&quot;.

Outtakes and interviews from Lennon and Ono&#x27;s Bed-In were released as promo 7&quot; vinyl acetates by Bell.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Wedding Album&quot; was initially released on Apple on 20 October 1969 in the US, and 7 November 1969 in the UK. The record came as an elaborate box set designed by John Kosh, including sets of photos, comic strip drawings by Lennon, a reproduction of the marriage certificate, a picture of a slice of wedding cake (inside a white sleeve), and a booklet of press clippings about the couple. It also included a Mylar bag that had the word &quot;Bagism&quot; printed on it. The album did not chart in the UK, but managed to peak at number 178 in the US, staying on the charts for three weeks. Regarding the limited success, Lennon later addressed it saying, &quot;It was like our sharing our wedding with whoever wanted to share it with us. We didn&#x27;t expect a hit record out of it. It was more of a... that&#x27;s why we called it Wedding Album. You know, people make a wedding album, show it to the relatives when they come round. Well, our relatives are the... what you call fans, or people that follow us outside. So that was our way of letting them join in on the wedding&quot;. The album was available on vinyl, cassette tape and 8-track tape, each with the same deluxe packaging. The album was also advertised through magazine print advertisements, which Lennon and Ono&#x27;s previous two albums had not been. The album was reissued in 1997 through Rykodisc with three bonus cuts – two of them B-sides by The Plastic Ono Band composed by Ono. The album was reissued again in March 2019 on Sean Lennon&#x27;s Chimera label in collaboration with Secretly Canadian. This edition was released with the two original tracks. The release commemorated the 50th anniversary of the famous Bed-In in the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel in March 1969.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; critic Richard Williams was given two single-sided test pressings for his review (which appeared on the front page of the November 15th issue). Each had a blank side featuring only an engineer&#x27;s test signal, but Williams mistook it for a double album. In his review, he noted that sides two and four consisted entirely &quot;of single tones maintained throughout, presumably produced electronically&quot;, and that the pitch of the notes appeared to change slightly. Lennon and Ono sent a telegram to Williams thanking him for his review and writing: &quot;We both feel that this is the first time a critic topped the artist. We are not joking.&quot;

<doc id="875973" wikidata="Q1144592" url="?curid=875973" title="Belém Palace">
<text>The Belém Palace (), formally the National Palace of Belém, (), is the current official residence of the president of the Portuguese Republic, the head of state of Portugal. Located in the Belém District of Lisbon, the palace&#x27;s main façade fronts the Afonso de Albuquerque Square, facing the Tagus River. A former residence of the Portuguese royal family, the Belém Palace complex is made up of various buildings, wings, courtyards, and gardens, built variously from the 18th to 21st centuries.

==History==

The site was originally part of the &quot;Outeiro das Vinhas&quot;, a property that fronted the beach of the Tagus River. D. Manuel of Portugal, a diplomat and poet who was the son of the 1st Count of Vimioso, acquired the land in 1559, naming it &quot;Quinta de Belém&quot; and constructing a building with three salons and two atria. By the mid-17th century the property was linked to a scion of the Royal Court, then transferred to the possession of the Counts of Aveiras and occupied by a convent.

The land was later acquired by King John V, who ordered its reconstruction in 1726. It encompassed two parcels, the &quot;Quinta de Baixo&quot; and &quot;Quinta do Meio&quot;, which the monarch purchased from João da Silva Telo, 3rd Count of Aveiros for 200,000 cruzados, in addition to the contiguous farmlands of the Counts of São Lourenço, with the objective of constructing a summer home. Although it is unclear when the first building was completed, by 1754 Queen Maria Anna of Austria had already died in the residence.

During the aftermath of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, it was determined that there was superficial damage and no fear of collapse, but a number of repairs were completed between 1755 and 1756. Under supervision of the architect João Pedro Ludovice, the &quot;Casa Real de Campo de Belém&quot; (Belém Royal Country House) or &quot;Palácio das Leoneiras&quot; also received attention. Work included replacing tile and repairs to the greenhouses and stables. Similarly, around 1770, architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira undertook reconstruction of the total estate. This was the beginning of several small projects within the residence that included the painting of the &quot;Sala das Bicas&quot;, the replacement of azulejo tiles along the southern veranda (1778), and construction of the birdhouses (1780). Initial construction of the Neoclassical horse training arena, designed by the Italian Giacomo Azzolini, began in 1828. The space is now occupied by the National Coach Museum

After 1807, with the departure of the royal family for Brazil, the furniture and artwork were removed from the palace, and the building was abandoned until the end of the Liberal Wars.

By 1839, the palace was once again used to hold royal balls, and served as the temporary residence for visiting royal dignitaries. In 1840, during extensive renovations of the Palace of Necessidades, the royal family returned to Belém and resided in the palace during that decade. The Infanta Antónia was born there in 1845. By 1850, renovation of the grand ballroom was complete, permitting Queen Maria II to receive Portuguese society, and in September 1861, the Infanta was married there to Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. In November 1861, the Infante Augusto died, followed by the Infante João on Christmas. A succession of deaths forced the royal family to abandon the palace, and it once again became a residence for visiting dignitaries. This change in purpose was accompanied by small repairs to the building, as well as the installation of gas lines and new lighting.

In 1886, after his marriage to Princess Amélie of Orléans, King Carlos ordered renovations of the palace to prepare it as the royal residence. These were completed under the direction of architect Rafael de Silva Castro; the interior was decorated by Leandro Braga, Columbano and João Vaz. The palace was the birthplace of the Prince Royal Luís Filipe in 1887 and Manuel in 1889.

Between 1902 and 1903, remodelling of the interior spaces was undertaken by Rosendo Carvalheira, with the additional construction of a visitors&#x27; house on the north walk of the &quot;Pátio das Damas&quot; to receive delegations of foreign dignitaries. This addition was inaugurated with the official visit of the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII, to Portugal at the end of 1903. The following year, the training stables were separated from the palace and destined to shelter the National Coach Museum.

By a royal decree published in the &quot;Diário do Governo&quot; (4 September), the palace ceased to operate as a royal residence, and passed to the Treasury for the &quot;accommodation of heads of state, princes and foreign missions that come on an official visit to Lisbon, leaving for that purpose by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs&quot;.

===Republic===

Following the 5 October 1910 Revolution, the &quot;Secretaria-Geral da Presidência da República&quot; (&quot;Secretary-General of the Presidency&quot;) moved into the palace on 24 August 1911, as article 45 of the Constitution prohibited the chief of state from occupying a residence on properties held by the state. A loophole in the document allowed the authorization on 28 June 1912 of a government edict to rent an annex alongside the palace for 100,000 réis per month to house the first president, Manuel de Arriaga, who eventually preferred to live in his local residence and work at the palace. This policy of renting the space continued throughout the period of the First Republic.

After the assassination of President Sidónio Pais in 1918 at the Rossio railway station, the ex-president&#x27;s body lay in state in the &quot;Sala Luís XV&quot; (&quot;Luís XV Hall&quot;) until his burial.

The official residency law for the president of the republic was promulgated on 24 March 1928. It specified that the president and his family would be permitted to reside in one of the national palaces. At the time of the promulgation, General Óscar Carmona decided to reside in the Citadel of Cascais, leaving the Palace of Belém for ceremonial affairs, official meetings, receptions and other formal occasions. In anticipation of the projected visit of the King of Spain, the palace underwent several renovations, although the visit did not materialize. In 1936, the main staircase was expanded by António Lino and finished by Cristino da Silva.

During the term of General Francisco Craveiro Lopes (1951–1952) the &quot;Arrábida&quot; wing was remodelled to serve as the residence of the president of the republic.

In 1967, the property was finally classified as an &quot;IIP - Imóvel de Interesse Público&quot; (&quot;Property of Public Interest&quot;), by decree 47-508, published in the &quot;Diário do Governo&quot; on 24 January 1967. The palace was closed in 1969 to repair damage from the earthquake of that year.

After the Carnation Revolution, the palace was made the headquarters of the &quot;Junta de Salvação Nacional&quot; (&quot;National Salvation Junta&quot;). It also experienced the traumas of the new democracy with the counter-revolutionary attempts by António Spínola and Francisco da Costa Gomes. As in previous administrations, Belém Palace underwent new renovations in the &quot;Arrábida&quot; wing in order to accommodate the demands of the president and his family. While some presidents resided in Belém, others such as Mário Soares, Jorge Sampaio, Aníbal Cavaco Silva and the current president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, used it merely as a workplace, living in their private residences during their terms.

Between 1980 and 1985, the main dining hall was used to exhibit gifts received by the chief of state. In 1998, the construction of the &quot;Centro de Documentação e Informação&quot; (&quot;Documentation and Information Centre&quot;), was begun by architect João Luís Carrilho da Graça, the winner of a public competition promoted by the Secretary-General of the Presidency.

President Jorge Sampaio commissioned painter Paula Rego for a series of paintings to decorate the walls of the palace chapel in 2002. The painter eventually gave her works entitled &quot;Ciclo da Vida da Virgem Maria e da Paixão de Jesus Cristo&quot; (&quot;Cycle of Life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Jesus Christ&quot;&quot;. The early exhibitions and Presidential initiatives would lead to the inauguration on 5 October 2004 of the Presidential Museum (). Similarly, the &quot;King D. Luís I Painting Gallery&quot; was the setting for the 2005 exposition, &quot;Do Palácio de Belém&quot;, which presented the history of the palace and its architecture, as well as an overview of artistic works that have been displayed there.

On 10 March 2006, a Ministry of Culture dispatch reclassified the palace as a National Monument to include the palace, gardens, Museum of the Presidency and other annexes.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
Belém Palace is a &quot;L&quot; shape building, with the main space located in a rectangular three-volume space in the south façade. This front, which faces the formal gardens, presents a space of five bodies, flanked by wedges surmounted by pinnacles. A combination of Mannerist and Baroque styles, has a central body with floor level arcades, over a colonnade gallery surmounted by a triangular pediment decorated in stucco.

The two outside blocks are farther in front then the main building, forming a terrace delimited by balusters and accessible by lateral staircases. The top of these lateral walls are topped by twelve panels of monochromatic azulejo tile. On the veranda are 14 azulejo panels representing figures from mythology, with many showing the &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot;, including &quot;&quot;Plutão e Cérbero&quot; (Pluto and Cerberus), &quot;Vénus&quot; (Venus), &quot;Neptuno&quot; (Neptune), &quot;Hércules&quot; (Hercules), &quot;Hércules e a égua de Diómedes&quot; (Hercules and the Mares of Diomedes), &quot;Figura masculina&quot; (Masculine figure), &quot;Figura masculina com arco e flechas&quot; (Masculine figure with bow and arrow), two panels of &quot;Figura feminina&quot; (Female figure), &quot;Hércules e a ave de Estinfália&quot; (Hercules and the Stymphalian birds), &quot;Figura masculina com machado&quot; (Masculine figure with hoe), &quot;Hércules e a serpente de Ládon&quot; (Hercules and the serpent Ladon), &quot;Hércules e o touro de Creta&quot; (Hercules and the Cretan Bull), &quot;Hércules e a Hidra de Lerna&quot;&quot; (Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra). There are also two rows of tiles with geometric patterns and acanthus leaves.

The eastern façade, which fronts the &quot;Pátio das Damas&quot; (Lady&#x27;s Patio), features two levels of windows and portal. The western wing is served from the &quot;Pátio dos Bichos&quot; (Animals&#x27; Patio), where a gated entrance and ramp provides access to the principal staircase via an elevated space that overlooks the &quot;Jardim da Cascata&quot; (Falls Garden). The space was resurfaced and re-paved with stone at the beginning of the 21st century.

Immediately in front of the palace, fronting the &quot;Rua de Belém&quot;, are the formal gardens. Of an 18th-century design, they consist of a terrace enclosed by a balustrade adorned with statues and intersecting pattern of hedges around three circular ponds. In the &quot;Jardim da Cascata&quot; (in the northwest corner of the grounds) there are three pavilions (greenhouses) of capstone topped by a decorative railing, with vases and statues. Inserted within a rounded-arch is a waterfall featuring a statue of Hercules.

In the central pavilion are six azulejo panels forming a figurative composition, completed in the 19th century. The central composition is in black and white, while the trim is polychromatic: yellow, green and manganese plant ornamentation. These panels include: an &quot;Outdoor Scene&quot;, &quot;Two female figures and a male figure in the park, with fruit basket&quot;, &quot;Standing female figure gives an apple to a male figure&quot;, a &quot;Backgammon game&quot;, &quot;Music in the Garden&quot; and &quot;Music in the Garden, with harpsichord and violin&quot;.

===Interior===

The main space is highlighted by a linear sequence of rooms along the south elevation, dominated by the &quot;Sala das Bicas&quot; (&quot;Room of the Spouts&quot;), a grand vestibule paved in marble. The ceiling is panelled with an allegorical composition of carved flora and 18th-century polychromatic azulejo ashlars, completed in the last quarter of that century. In the space one can observe along one wall two round marble fountains with lion heads, which give the space its name. In addition, the space is surrounded by eight jasper busts on plinths, representing Roman emperors.

In the &quot;Sala Dourada&quot; or &quot;Salão de Baile&quot; (&quot;Golden Room&quot; or &quot;Ballroom&quot;, respectively) the ceiling is panelled with a central allegory of the Roman Empire, with murals and crown moulding medallions in a neo-Pompeian motif.

The &quot;Sala Luís XV&quot; (&quot;Louis Quinze Room&quot;), also panelled, is highlighted by a series of paintings surmounted by two shields of the Houses of Braganza and Orléans.

The narrow rectangular chapel, with smooth walls and wood panelling, is occupied by a Neoclassical retable in gold-leafed wood, with a painting by André Reinoso representing the &quot;&quot;A Adoração dos Pastores&quot; (&quot;The Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;). The vaulted ceiling is decorated with a profusion of decorative motifs in a &quot;ferronneire&quot; similar to those found in the &quot;Sala Dourada&quot;. On the walls are paintings by the artist Paula Rego, representing the &quot;Ciclo da Vida da Virgem Maria e da Paixão de Jesus Cristo&quot; (&quot;Circle of Life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ&quot;).

<doc id="875975" wikidata="Q1840468" url="?curid=875975" title="List of governors of California before 1850">
<text>Below is a list of the governors of early California (1769–1850), before its admission as the 31st U.S. state. First explored by , with colonies established at San Diego and Monterey, California was a remote, sparsely-settled Spanish province of New Spain. In 1822, following Mexican independence, California became part of Mexico.

In 1836, a coup led by and eventually resulted in Alvarado becoming governor. That conflict ended in 1838, when the central government of Mexico recognized Alvarado as California Governor. The territorial (legislature) approved the appointment.

Another disputed governorship occurred in 1844, settled when another Californio, Pio Pico, became the last Governor of Mexican California. In 1846, the &quot;Bear Flag Revolt&quot; in Sonoma declared California an independent republic—the &quot;Bear Flag Republic&quot;. No government was formed, however, and the revolt did not have time to spread very far because California came under U.S. military occupation at the outset of the Mexican–American War less than a month later. California was ceded to the U.S. in 1848, and was admitted as the 31st U.S. state on September 9, 1850. Peter Burnett, the last governor of the post-war military territory, became its first state governor after admission.

== Spanish rule (1769–1822) ==
The Spanish Empire established its rule in the Californias in 1769. During this time, the Californias encompassed a massive territorial expanse, including both Alta California (present day U.S. state of California) and Baja California (present day Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur), which were governed under a military administration led by the Governor of the Californias. In 1804, the Californias were officially divided into two administrations: Alta California, based in Monterey, and Baja California, based in Loreto.

===Spanish governors of the Californias (1769–1804)===
From 1769 to 1804, the Californias were governed as one administrative unit within the Spanish Empire. Following 1804, Alta California and Baja California each had their own administration. 
===Spanish governors of Alta California (1804–1822)===
Following the division of the Californias in 1804, Alta California came to have its own administration. José Joaquín de Arrillaga, who had served as Governor of the Californias until 1804 subsequently served as the first governor of Alta California.
== Mexican rule (1822–1846) ==
Following the Mexican War of Independence from the Spanish, both of the Californias became part of the newly independent Mexico in 1822. Mexican rule was interrupted from 1836 to 1838 by the Californio independence movement led by Juan Bautista Alvarado, who was acclaimed President of Alta California. However, Alvarado entered into negotiations with the Mexican government in 1838, which resulted in the disbandment of the Californio independence movement in favor of greater autonomy and the appointment of Alvarado as governor, thus reestablishing Mexican rule in Alta California, which lasted until 1846.

===Mexican governors of Alta California (1822–1836)===
===President of Alta California (1836–1837)===
Following the appointments of unpopular governors Gutiérrez and Chico, Juan Bautista Alvarado successfully led a popular uprising of Californios in 1836 which deposed Gutiérrez, proclaimed the independence of Alta California from Mexico, and named Alvarado as its president. Alvarado maintained effective control over California until he entered into negotiations with the Mexican central government in 1837, which resulted in the disbandment of Alta Californian independence in favor of greater autonomy from the Mexican government and recognition of Alvarado as Governor of Alta California.

===Mexican governors of California (1837–47)===
While Juan Bautista Alvarado maintained effective control as President of Alta California from 1836 to 1837, the Mexican central government appointed noted Californio statesman Carlos Antonio Carrillo as Governor of California to lead the nationalist offensive against Alvarado. As Carrillo was unsuccessful, Alvarado and the Mexican central government negotiated an end to the civil war in Alta California, resulting in Alvarado&#x27;s abandonment of independence in favor of greater autonomy and the governorship, thus reestablishing the continuity of Mexican governance over Alta California.

== American rule ==
Following the American Conquest of California, forces part of the Pacific Squadron and California Battalion established U.S. military rule in California, beginning in 1846. Military governors ruled California until 1849, when efforts led by Bennet C. Riley led to the creation of the Constitution of California at the Constitutional Convention of Monterey and the establishment of civilian rule with the election of Peter Hardeman Burnett as the first governor of California. Soon after, California was admitted as a state.

<text>Morningside Park is a public park in Upper Manhattan in New York City, New York, United States. The park is bounded by 110th Street to the south, 123rd Street to the north, Morningside Avenue to the east, and Morningside Drive to the west. A cliff made of Manhattan schist runs through the park and separates Morningside Heights, above the cliff to the west, from Harlem. The park includes other rock outcroppings; a human-made ornamental pond and waterfall; three sculptures; several athletic fields; playgrounds; and an arboretum. Morningside Park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, although the group Friends of Morningside Park helps maintain it.

The area near Morningside Park was originally known as by the Lenape Native Americans in the Delaware languages. A park in this location was first proposed by the Central Park commissioners in 1867, and the city commissioned Central Park&#x27;s designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux to produce a design for the park in 1873. Jacob Wrey Mould was hired to design new plans in 1880, but little progress occurred until Olmsted and Vaux were asked to modify the plans following Mould&#x27;s death in 1886. The &quot;Lafayette and Washington&quot;, &quot;Carl Schurz Monument&quot;, and &quot;Seligman Fountain&quot; sculptures were installed after the park was completed in 1895.

After a period of neglect in the early 20th century, the park received sporting fields and playgrounds between the 1930s and the 1950s. Columbia University proposed constructing a gym in the southern end of the park in the early 1960s; the plan was abandoned after students organized protests against the gym in 1968, citing concerns over racial segregation. In the late 20th century, Morningside Park gained a reputation for high crime rates, and several groups devised plans to renovate the park. The site of the unbuilt Columbia gym was turned into a waterfall and pond in 1990, and the park&#x27;s arboretum was added in 1998. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Morningside Park as a scenic landmark in 2008.

== History ==

=== Site ===
Morningside Park straddles the more-than- cliff between the high terrain of Morningside Heights to the west and the lowlands of Harlem to the east. The cliff was created through fault movement and smoothed during several glacial periods in the last several million years. Before the 17th century, when modern-day Manhattan was settled by Europeans, the region had been occupied by the Lenape Native Americans for several thousand years. The Lenape referred to the area near the park as or , meaning &#x27;place of rushes&#x27;.

Dutch settlers occupied Manhattan in the early 17th century and called the area around Morningside Park , meaning &#x27;peaceful dale&#x27;. The lowlands to the east were called by the Dutch, and were later translated to &quot;Flats&quot; in English. The land to the east was not settled initially because of its marshy topography. The area became known as Montagne&#x27;s (or Montayne&#x27;s) Flat after Johannes de la Montagne, who was among the first European settlers of New Harlem in 1658; he owned about between what is now 109th and 124th Streets. The western boundary of the area was the cliff, while the eastern boundary was a creek that emptied east into the East River. Montagne&#x27;s Flat was subdivided into lots in 1662, and four years later a new charter for New Harlem was given to the English, who had seized New Netherland, renaming it New York. Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the cliff formed a geopolitical boundary between Harlem to the east and the heights to the west.

The western boundary of New Harlem was drawn through the present-day Morningside Park in 1666, running from 74th Street at the East River to 124th Street at the North River (now the Hudson River). To the west of the line were the common lands of the Province of New York, which were sold to Jacob De Key in 1701. Following Harman Vandewater&#x27;s acquisition of part of the De Key farm by 1735, it was called Vandewater Heights by 1738. Vandewater Heights would then be sold by 1785 to James W. De Peyster. There were disputes over the De Key farm throughout the 18th century, disputes which eventually resulted in the cliffside&#x27;s being named as the farm&#x27;s eastern boundary. Meanwhile, Montagne&#x27;s Flat was owned by several families in the 17th and 18th centuries, some of whom were slaveholders, according to censuses taken in 1790, 1800, and 1810. British Army colonial forces used a road on the farm to retreat during the September 16, 1776, Battle of Harlem Heights, one of the battles of the American Revolutionary War.

In the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which laid out a grid system for Manhattan island, little regard was given to the topography of the area. Shortly afterward, during the War of 1812, several blockhouse fortifications were built in the area. The first such fort was built in what is now Central Park, and three other blockhouses numbered 2, 3, and 4 were erected within present-day Morningside Park. The blockhouses at Morningside Park were along the cliff and were numbered from north to south: No. 2 at 113th–114th Streets, No. 3 at 121st Street, and No. 4 at 123rd Street. These would not be used in battle and were left to deteriorate. Morningside Heights would remain sparsely developed for the next half-century except for the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum and the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum.

=== Design and construction ===

==== Initial plans ====

By 1866, the state legislature had given the Central Park commissioners the authority to construct streets on Manhattan&#x27;s west side from 67th to 155th Streets. In 1867, lead Central Park commissioner Andrew Haswell Green proposed that a park be built in Morningside Heights to avoid the expense of expanding the Manhattan street grid across extremely steep terrain. Green enclosed a map by John J. Serrell that modified the Commissioners&#x27; Plan to this extent. The Central Park commissioners passed an act on March 26, 1868, allowing the acquisition of lands for parks. Under this act, the commissioners purchased , and seized another through eminent domain, at a total cost of US$1.33 million.

In April 1870, the Central Park commission was dissolved and the City of New York obtained jurisdiction over the property. That September, Department of Public Parks (DPP) chief engineer Montgomery A. Kellogg was asked to create a plan for Morningside Park. Over the next year, the city would spend $5,500 to conduct surveys of the proposed parkland. Kellogg presented a design for the park in October 1871. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the park&#x27;s name was apt for it would &quot;[possess] a sunny exposure in the early morning hours,&quot; and described the planned park as having &quot;handsome walks, flower-beds, jetting fountains, [and] a play-ground&quot; among other things. The &quot;Times&quot; predicted that the planned Morningside Park &quot;will doubtless be a favorite resort for children and invalids.&quot; Kellogg&#x27;s plan was rejected by the Board of Commissioners for Public Parks.

In April 1872, the DPP created a committee to discuss possible upgrades to the street to the park&#x27;s west side, and Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who had designed Central Park&#x27;s Greensward Plan, were commissioned to produce a design for the park. In a September 1872 article, the &quot;Times&quot; predicted that the construction of Morningside Park and its proximity to Broadway and Central Park would raise property values nearby. Talk of a preliminary study and map began circulating in March 1873. By that September, Olmsted was assigned to work exclusively on Morningside Park, and he was dropped from his position as superintendent of other parks. Olmsted and Vaux presented their plan, &quot;A Preliminary Report on the Improvement of Morningside Park&quot;, to the DPP on October 11, 1873. Because of the limitations of the terrain, the proposed design would emphasize scenery, with balconies, a planted lagoon, a lawn at the north end of the park, and a retaining wall with stairways. The design also took into consideration the site&#x27;s proximity to Central Park, one block away from the southern end of the proposed Morningside Park. The work would cost about $816,000. Five days after the plan was presented, the DPP approved it &quot;in principle&quot;.

==== Beginning of construction ====
Owing to several factors, including work stoppages following the economic depression after the Panic of 1873, construction on Morningside Park stagnated for 14 years. Nevertheless, work began in 1873, construction progressing on the walks and perimeter walls, as well as on the sewers and lagoon. When work was halted in October 1874, the sewer, pond, walks, and embankments were under construction. A &quot;Times&quot; article in April 1875 noted that the city&#x27;s Department of Public Works was laying roads and sidewalks west and east of the park.

Little work was performed in the next five years, except for the construction of roads. On June 16, 1880, the Legislature passed a law allowing the city&#x27;s Department of Public Works to finish the roads, sidewalks, and retaining walls near Morningside Park. That September, the Legislature appointed Jacob Wrey Mould, who had previously been involved in Central Park&#x27;s design, as the new architect of Morningside Park. Mould submitted a plan for the streets in April 1881. The proposal, which was to cost $234,000, called for eleven entrances; granite stairs; a retaining wall at Morningside Drive, made of gneiss and ashlar; overlook balconies; and railings of granite and cast-and wrought-iron. The plans were approved in August 1881. Mould&#x27;s final plans for the western side of the park were submitted in September 1882 and plans for the northern, eastern, and southern sides were approved the next month.

In January 1883, Julius Munckwitz was asked to create plans for Morningside Park, and Mould was named as his assistant. After Munckwitz&#x27;s plans were submitted that March, Montgomery A. Kelloggthe DPP chief engineer who had been promoted to engineer of constructionworked on completing the measurements. Contracts for the foundations were awarded in April, while contracts for the western side&#x27;s entrances and overlooks were awarded to Charles Jones that July. Jones began work on the western border in November 1883 and completed his contract nearly a year later. Meanwhile, in January 1884, Munckwitz began preparing plans for the western steps and entrances, which were approved that October. The &quot;Times&quot; reported in December 1884 that over $71,000 was needed for the park. Though Munckwitz quit the DPP in mid-1885, he continued working with the project as a consultant.

By February 1885, the stairways on the western border at 110th, 116th, and 120th Streets were being built. That May, Michael McGrath won a contract to build granite steps, brick arches, and other ornamentation at the 110th and 116th Street entrances on the western border and at four intermediate overlook bays. The park was still in a rural state, as indicated in the &quot;Times&quot; that same year, which reported that police were capturing cows for illegally grazing in the park and fining local dairymen for pasturing their herds. Following this, the DPP ordered that all signs and other &quot;defacements&quot; be removed from the park site. By mid-1886, several local entities were expressing frustration at the lack of progress at Morningside Park. For instance, the Morningside Park Association twice requested that action be taken to complete the park. After Mould died in 1886, the DPP needed to hire a new architect for Morningside Park. Kellogg submitted new plans for $250,000 worth of park improvements in February 1887, at which point the &quot;Times&quot; reported that only the 116th Street staircase and part of the retaining wall had been completed over the previous fourteen years. These plans were ultimately approved.

==== Final plans and completion ====
In June 1887, the DPP asked Olmsted to create informal plans for Central, Morningside, and Riverside Parks. In response, Olmsted said he would do so only if Vaux was also hired. Ultimately, Olmsted&#x27;s proposal was voted down, and Kellogg and city parks superintendent Samuel Parsons were asked to report on Olmsted and Vaux&#x27;s original plan instead. In July, a group of Civil War veterans stayed in the park during the Independence Day weekend, hosting a historical reenactment in which they fired cannons and pretended to storm the blockhouse walls. Though Parsons and Kellogg presented their proposed changes in August 1887, which they believed were feasible with the available $250,000 appropriation, local property owners asked that the original plan be used instead. Later that month, the board voted to let Olmsted and Vaux work on the plan.

The plan was modified to accommodate changed conditions, like the construction of an elevated railway station at 116th Street and Eighth Avenue. Among other changes, the modified design included a broad path and a thin path traversing the lower portion of the park. Initially, Olmsted and Vaux had proposed a southeastern entrance plaza, a lagoon, and an exhibition hall; the modified design eliminated these, while adding a lawn and a &quot;Restawhile&quot; recreation structure. Olmsted and Vaux had differing visions for Morningside Park: Olmsted believed the area should be kept naturalistic, and advocated the removal of all except one east–west path, while Vaux did not believe that paths would negatively affect the park&#x27;s purpose. The &quot;General Plan for the Improvement of Morningside Park&quot; was approved by the DPP in October 1887, and a request for $250,000 in bonds was approved by the Board of Estimate the following month.

In mid-1888, contracts were awarded for earth and rock filling, and for the construction of basins, walls, and stairs in the southern portion of the park. Vaux suggested widening the roadbed and narrowing the eastern sidewalk of Morningside Drive, on the western side of the park. Further appropriations of $50,000 each were requested in September 1888 and March 1889. Subsequently, Vaux&#x27;s suggestion to modify Morningside Drive was approved in July 1889, as was Kellogg&#x27;s request for asphalt, concrete, and gravel for pavings. That September, the DPP voted to proceed with the completion of stairs and overlooks at Morningside Avenue north of 117th Street, in the same design as those built previously. Stairs and walls were finished that December. Further plans, approved in early 1890, called for the completion of the western entrances and overlooks, and the installation of railings and ornamentation. By December 1890, the &quot;Real Estate Record and Builders Guide&quot; reported that the work was almost done. The &quot;Guide&quot; said of the park, &quot;It is not very wide, but it is some three-quarters of a mile in length. It has hills and dales and green swards, which, with its imposing terraces, make it peculiarly attractive.&quot; Morningside Park was even considered briefly for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, which ultimately occurred in Chicago.

Plans for walls and railings at 110th Street (the southern border) and Morningside Drive (the western border) were approved in October 1890, followed by the awarding of a contract for them in February 1892. Because of delays in constructing the steps, two time extensions were awarded in August and October 1891. Meanwhile, pavings were completed in May 1891 and the parapets were finished the following December. By June 1894, parks superintendent Parsons had noted that parts of the park were nearly completed. That October, contracts were awarded for the paving of sidewalks. The park&#x27;s construction was completed in 1895. Vaux, who had remained with the project throughout that time as a consultant, drowned that year in Gravesend Bay. Parsons later wrote that &quot;...perhaps Morningside Park was the most consummate piece of art that [Vaux] had ever created.&quot;

The completion of Morningside Park was concurrent with the development of nearby Morningside Heights; the park&#x27;s construction had necessarily resulted in the creation of the neighborhood&#x27;s street grid, and several institutions relocated to the area. The first of these included the Cathedral of St. John the Divine whose construction began in 1892 on the site of the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum. The Bloomingside Asylum moved out of the area in 1888 after protests over the asylum&#x27;s presence, and three colleges moved to the site: Columbia College (now part of Columbia University), Teachers College, and Barnard College. Other institutions that moved to Morningside Heights following the park&#x27;s completion included: St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, the former Home for Old Men and Aged Couples; St. Luke&#x27;s Home for Indigent Christian Females; the former Woman&#x27;s Hospital; Union Theological Seminary; and the Church of Notre Dame (L&#x27;Eglise de Notre Dame).

=== Early and mid-20th centuries ===
Several sculptures and structures were installed in Morningside Park after it was completed. In 1900, the statue &quot;Lafayette and Washington&quot; by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi was installed at the park&#x27;s eastern border, within the triangle bounded by Manhattan Avenue, Morningside Avenue and 114th Street. At the time, only one structure had been built in the park, a wooden shanty for tool storage. In 1901, a &quot;women&#x27;s cottage and refreshment room&quot; was approved along with a $8,250 appropriation for it, and the following year Barney and Chapman proposed an ornate outhouse in the French Gothic style containing a tower with space for tool storage. Ultimately, a simpler one-story restroom structure was erected in 1904, at a site on 114th Street that had been the original location proposed for the &quot;Restawhile&quot;. Many residents and neighborhood organizations strongly opposed an oval stadium, proposed between 118th and 120th Streets in 1909, and the idea was eventually scrapped. In 1913, the &quot;Carl Schurz Memorial&quot; by Karl Bitter and Henry Bacon was placed in the park, followed the next year by Edgar Walter&#x27;s &quot;Seligman (Bear and Faun) Fountain&quot;.

Morningside Park quickly began to deteriorate, and complaints of vandalism were recorded as early as 1905. The sidewalks around the park were paved in 1911. When the city proposed to &quot;popularize&quot; Central Park in 1911, local residents complained that Morningside Park had been neglected, was crime-ridden, and had declined because of its use as a playground as opposed to a passive-recreation space. New York City parks commissioner Charles B. Stover stated that the park&#x27;s issues, which included hillside erosion and lawn damage, were because the southern area had not been outfitted with proper drainage. Further erosion and deterioration was caused by a large Independence Day celebration in 1912, the erosion of the cliff near Blockhouse No. 4 in 1913, and the destruction of part of the overhanging cliff rock in 1915. A request for $94,500 toward Morningside Park&#x27;s renovation was made in 1914, and by 1916, protests had resulted in the reported completion of the renovation. Also in 1914, a fence was installed around part of the park.

Further controversy developed in the mid-1910s because of the proposed construction of a Catskill Aqueduct pumping station within the park. While a temporary structure had existed in the park since at least the early 1910s, the New York Board of Water Supply began construction of a steel-frame pumping station in January 1916. The plans were not public, and had not been authorized by either the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), the New York City Board of Aldermen, or the Municipal Art Commission. Once the public learned of plans for the structure, several civil engineers and associations organized opposition to the project. The sculptor, Gutzon Borglum, filed a lawsuit to stop construction of the pump building that February. Shortly afterward, New York Supreme Court justice Edward R. Finch issued an injunction to stop the project temporarily, citing the project&#x27;s status as an &quot;illegal encroachment&quot;. Ultimately, the Board of Water Supply applied for a permanent pumping station, though in July 1916 the Board of Aldermen voted instead to build an underground pump structure.

Improvements to Morningside Park were also conducted from the 1920s through the 1960s. In its annual report of 1929, NYC Parks reported that much of the vegetation had to be replanted because of neglect or vandalism. By the mid-20th century, Morningside Park was perceived as dangerous. Because of its proximity to Harlem, a largely Black neighborhood, crime in the park was perceived as signs of a racial conflict. In 1935 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Teachers College of Columbia University had posted a sign in a dormitory informing students &quot;it is not safe to enter Morningside Park at any time of the day or night.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; also reported residents were concerned that &quot;unemployed destitute&quot; individuals posed a danger to the park&#x27;s safety.

A playground and comfort station was added between 113th and 114th Streets on the east side of Morningside Park in November 1935; the 113th–114th Streets comfort station was replaced by 1945. A polygonal comfort station was proposed for the southeastern corner of the park in 1936 but was not built. A playground at the northeastern corner of Morningside Park was also constructed in 1935; it was expanded with extra equipment in 1941, including athletic courts, a wading pool, exercise structure, swings, slides, and a children&#x27;s play area. Also, by 1941, rock outcroppings on the south lawn were removed to make way for softball fields. During this era, a proposal to rename Morningside Park to &quot;Franz Boas Park&quot; was rejected by parks commissioner Robert Moses. The 1904 restroom structure was demolished in 1952, except for its western wall, at which point jagged-topped stone barriers were erected next to paths in the park. Two years later, the bronze railings on the western and southern borders were replaced with iron picket fences. A playground on Morningside Avenue between 116th and 119th Streets was finished in 1956, while sandboxes were installed on the Morningside Drive overlook balconies the next year. The wrought-iron fence on the eastern border was replaced, and the park&#x27;s hillside restored, in 1962.

=== 1950s and 1960s controversies ===
==== Columbia athletic complex ====

In a 1955 piece in the &quot;Times&quot;, one observer noted, &quot;the park was virtually off-bounds to [Columbia University] students and faculty as &quot;too dangerous&quot;. At the time, parks commissioner Moses and Columbia president Grayson L. Kirk were discussing allowing Columbia to use part of Morningside Park. The plan was approved by the New York City Board of Estimate in December 1955, and soon after, Moses and Manhattan borough president Hulan Jack announced that Columbia would build a comfort station/field house, storage building, and athletic complex on a section of the park. The athletic complex contained two fields for softball, three for football, and one for soccer and was opened in May 1957. The arrangement between Columbia and the city stipulated that the university would be the sole user of the complex during weekdays between June and October, while it would be open to the public at other times. The fields soon became popular with neighborhood residents. In 1961, new lighting was installed in the southern section of Morningside Park to deter crime.

More controversial was Columbia&#x27;s proposal in January 1960 to erect a building to the north of the athletic fields. The structure, on a plot, would have an upper level to be used as a Columbia gym and a lower level community center. The complex was supported by Moses, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., and the New York City Council. A 50-year lease was approved in March 1960, signed in August, and accepted by the Board of Estimate. The structure was to cost $9 million, of which $1 million was donated in May 1962 by alumnus Francis S. Levien. The project faced some opposition by 1964 because of Columbia&#x27;s rapid expansion. Some residents denounced the proposed Morningside Park construction as a &quot;land grab&quot;, while others protested the proposed gentrification that would accompany such expansion. Subsequently, in March 1964, neighborhood associations and officials toured the park to demonstrate its deteriorated conditions and need for funding, and to show that it was safe.

Thomas Hoving, one of the parks commissioners who succeeded Moses, said in January 1966 that he was &quot;pretty damned upset&quot; about the deal because it would perpetuate segregation. The planned separate east and west entrances were seen as an attempt to circumvent the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned racially segregated facilities, as Morningside Heights&#x27; population was largely white while Harlem&#x27;s was largely Black. The University&#x27;s administration under Grayson Kirk denied that this reflected racial bias and stressed that greater park services would benefit the Harlem community. In March 1966, the University&#x27;s student council passed a resolution asking the University to reconsider the gym plans, and two months later, bills to ban its construction were introduced in the State Senate and Assembly. That October, Columbia announced it would suspend groundbreaking for the gym until the following year, and by May 1967, university officials were considering changing the plans. Unsatisfied, protesters picketed outside Kirk&#x27;s home that July, while Harlem officials decried a proposed compromise to build a community swimming pool instead. Undeterred, the Board of Estimate voted to approve the plans in October 1967, and despite further protests that November, construction began in February 1968. At the time, &quot;The New York Times&quot; architecture writer Ada Louise Huxtable said, &quot;the real tragedy of the whole Columbia gym affair is that this dubious and even harmful project has been carried out in good faith.&quot;

Columbia students and faculty amplified their opposition to the gym project in mid-1968, resulting in major student protests. That April, the faculty of the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation called on Kirk and the trustees to reconsider the gym. Student organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Afro-American Society held &quot;sit-ins&quot;, and Mayor John Lindsay requested that work be suspended while the protests were ongoing. Students occupied administration and classroom buildings and shut down the university for several weeks. The Columbia faculty formed a committee to intervene after a large 2,500-person protest on April 30, which involved a New York City Police Department raid at several buildings. Meanwhile, parks commissioner August Heckscher II said that if Columbia was to drop its plans, he would have a community recreation center built at the site. The same month, $500,000 was allocated for restorations to the park, and the new Morningside Park Preservation Committee filed a lawsuit alleging the misuse of parkland. Kirk resigned in August 1968 because of the protests and was replaced as Columbia president by Andrew W. Cordier. Under his leadership, Columbia&#x27;s trustees studied possible new sites for the gym before voting in March 1969 to cancel the project altogether.

==== Elementary school ====

At the same time as the Columbia controversy, another dispute arose after the New York State Legislature designated the northwestern corner of Morningside Park as the site of a public elementary school in 1963. Both Mayor Wagner and borough president Edward R. Dudley supported this initiative; Dudley said the site was &quot;rubbish-strewn and a danger spot for children&quot;, even though the Municipal Art Commission argued it was atop the ruins of Blockhouse No. 4.

After the City Planning Commission proposed another site several blocks to the east, neighborhood groups alleged the plan would further segregation since the mostly minority population of Harlem would be unable to reach the school. Other neighborhood groups opposed the use of Morningside Park for anything other than recreational use. The City Planning Commission&#x27;s chairman recommended that the proposed school site at Morningside Park be disapproved, but in February 1964, the Board of Estimate approved the plan anyway and rezoned from parkland to educational use. Frederick G. Frost, Jr. &amp; Associates designed the structure, known as 36 Margaret Douglas Elementary School, as a concrete-and-brick educational complex atop a stone base and rock outcroppings. The school was built between 1965 and 1966 and was the first in the city designed solely for early elementary grades, serving kindergarten through second grade.

=== Cleanup and renovations ===

==== Late 20th century ====
Even by the 1960s, Morningside Park had a reputation for being unsafe and unsanitary. After the Columbia protests ended, Morningside Park was the site of several murders, muggings, and other crimes, furthering its notoriety. Litter lined the park, and it became a frequent homeless hangout. So common were crimes there that Morningside Heights residents nicknamed it &quot;Muggingside Park&quot;. In 1971, after the controversy over the now-canceled Columbia site had subsided, NYC Parks published its &quot;Proposed Rehabilitation of Columbia Gym Site&quot;, which called for a playground on the site&#x27;s eastern edge and new paths on the western side. It was reported that Columbia had agreed to pay compensation for the demolition that had occurred in the park. This resulted in the formation of the West Harlem Coalition for Morningside Park. Advocates started focusing on Morningside Park and Olmsted&#x27;s other parks in 1972, the 150th anniversary of his birth. The West Harlem Coalition hired Lawrence Halprin Associates in 1973, but plans for renovating Morningside Park were postponed after the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. Huxtable wrote in the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Morningside Park may now be the city&#x27;s most crime-ridden, underutilized and dangerous spot.&quot; More than a decade after the Columbia gym plan was canceled, the construction fencing remained on the site.

The state&#x27;s department of parks was in talks with Bond, Ryder and Associates for a &quot;redevelopment design&quot; of Morningside Park by 1978 with the West Harlem Community Organization and Morningside Park Coalition participating in the redesign process. In 1981, as part of the &quot;Olmsted Project&quot;, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) held two shows that depicted Morningside Park, including a Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit. At that time, Morningside Park was being considered by the LPC for scenic landmark status, but this was opposed by residents and activists wanted to redesign the park. The same year, Thomas Kiel and other Columbia undergraduates founded the Friends of Morningside Park, which supported returning the park to its original design.

NYC Parks drew up plans for a $12 million restoration of the park between 1987 and 1989. At that point, Columbia had given $250,000 toward the renovation, half of what it had pledged toward the restoration of the site. A $5 million first phase began in early 1989 and was conducted by a partnership of Quennell Rothschild Associates and Bond Ryder James. It entailed converting the excavated crater left by the abandoned gymnasium project into a waterfall and ornamental pond, which was the first part of the renovation to be completed in 1989. The pond, part of Olmsted and Vaux&#x27;s original plan, cost $950,000, about three times as much as &quot;standard landscaping&quot;. Contractors installed wells to feed the waterfall and the pond. The reconstruction, which focused on the park between 110th and 114th Streets, also included installing new playground equipment, planting trees, creating a picnic area and renovating the sports fields. The 1957 fieldhouse was also redesigned, and a new entrance was installed at 113th Street and Morningside Drive. This renovation was completed in 1993. There was little funding to perform further renovations at the northern part of Morningside Park then, and there was just one maintenance worker for the entire park. As a result, the northern part of the park was still overgrown with weeds and frequented by drug addicts.

NYC Parks began a renovation of the 116th Street stairs in July 1996 and completed it two years later at a cost of $650,000. After the statues were refurbished, the bluestone steps at 116th Street were renovated in 1998. The same year, construction began on the Dr. Thomas Kiel Arboretum in the northern part of the park, named after a founder and former chairman of the Friends of Morningside Park who had died in 1996. In 1998 and 1999, the Morningside Area Alliance (MAA), a neighborhood community group, received $35,000 in grant funding from the Kaplan Foundation to work on the park. A portion was used to assess what the park needed done most urgently, while a second portion went to restructure the largely disorganized Friends volunteer group. The resulting &quot;revitalization plan&quot; suggested further maintenance and capital improvements and enhancements to its character and appearance. The study also found there was still a widespread perception of danger, and that the park needed additional security measures and better management.

==== 21st century ====
By 2001, Morningside Park&#x27;s condition had improved because of ongoing reconstruction projects, and it was no longer considered as dangerous an area as it had been in the 1970s. That year, a master plan for the park was approved. Several stairs and entrances were rebuilt, including at or near 114th, 116th, 120th, and 122nd Streets, and playgrounds to the south of the ball fields and at the park&#x27;s northeast corner were renovated. The ball fields and northern section&#x27;s scenery were restored in 2006, and construction began on a playground north of 116th Street in 2007. This playground was completed in late 2008. Morningside Park was designated a New York City landmark in 2008, decades after similar statuses had been conferred upon Central and Riverside Parks. The next year, more trees were planted within the park, including a sequoia tree.

NYC Parks presented a plan to restore the northern section, including the 123rd Street Playground there, in 2011. The playground was renovated in two phases: in 2013 and in 2019. The 118th Street Playground was rebuilt between December 2019 and March 2021 for $3.3 million. The waterfall was fixed in 2018, then stopped working shortly afterward. The area around Morningside Park, once a desolate area with a reputation for being crime-ridden, had become gentrified by the 2010s. Fears of crime remained, especially after 18-year-old Barnard College student Tessa Majors was fatally stabbed in a late-2019 mugging within the park. Columbia University student Davide Giri was fatally stabbed nearby in 2021 in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;an eerie reprise&quot; of Majors&#x27;s death.

In 2023, the LPC approved plans for the construction of a food kiosk at the southern edge of the park, along West 110th Street. During the same year, neighborhood residents also began advocating for the waterfall to be repaired; at the time, the waterfall had not flowed for four years. Following these requests, Columbia&#x27;s Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science indicated that it would fix the waterfall. Columbia and NYC Parks also began researching the algae in the park&#x27;s pond in mid-2023, and the waterfall began flowing again in late 2024.

== Geography and design ==
Morningside Park covers approximately in Upper Manhattan, New York City. The park is irregularly shaped and follows a largely north–south alignment, though the northern portion of the park curves westward. All of the sidewalks were asphalt until 1911; , they consist of Belgian blocks and concrete and contain trees. There are at least seventeen entrances to the park. The closest New York City Subway stations to the park are and , both served by the ; the park is also served by MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27; , and M116 routes.

=== Bordering streets ===
The park&#x27;s western border is formed by Morningside Drive, which is on top of a large retaining wall that drops sharply to the east. The retaining wall contains gneiss piers topped with granite, and as a parapet fence consisting of granite posts and an iron picket fence. Originally, this section also contained bronze railings, though these were replaced in 1954. At each of the intersections with Morningside Drive, except for those at 113th and 114th Streets, there are &quot;overlook bays&quot;balconies that slightly overhang the park below. The bays at 111th and 119th Street contain openings, originally used as rain shelters. All the bays are polygonal shaped, except for the one at 116th Street, which is round and contains the &quot;Carl Schurz Monument&quot;. From this side, there are entrances at 112th, 113th, 114th, 116th, 118th, 120th, and 122nd Streets, with granite and gneiss stairways leading from the bays at the 116th through 120th Street entrances. A security booth at the 116th Street entrance was installed in 2006.

The southern border of the park is formed by West 110th Street, also known as Cathedral Parkway. There is an entrance to the park from the intersection of 110th Street and Morningside Drive, within an overlook bay that contains asphalt paving; this leads to a stone stairway. Another entrance exists at the intersection with Manhattan Avenue, on the east made of Belgian blocks and hexagonal asphalt tiles.

The eastern border of the park is formed by Manhattan Avenue, between 110th and 113th Streets, and by Morningside Avenue, between 113th and 123rd Streets. It contains entrances at 112th, 113th, 114th, 116th, 120th, and 123rd Streets, as well as between 117th and 118th Streets. Along the sidewalk is a wrought-iron picket fence with stone piers, which was originally installed in 1915 and replaced in 1962. A group of seventeen London plane trees are next to the Lafayette and Washington statue.

The northern border of the park is formed by West 123rd Street. There is an entrance plaza from the northwestern corner of the park, which is paved with concrete and flanked with stone posts. Along the sidewalk is a wrought-iron picket fence with stone piers, which was originally installed in 1915 and replaced in 1962.

=== Geology and topography ===

Morningside Park&#x27;s distinctive natural geography is a rugged cliff of Manhattan schist rock. The geology is similar to that of Central Park and contains, from top to bottom: Manhattan schist, metamorphosed sedimentary rock; Lowerre quartzite, a metamorphosed rock; Inwood marble, metamorphosed limestone which overlays the gneiss; and Fordham gneiss, an older deeper layer. A large rock formation of Manhattan schist in the park is a visible sign of the bedrock below much of lower and northern Manhattan. Rock outcroppings are prevalent in Morningside Park and nearby Central Park, Marcus Garvey Park, and Riverside Park. Besides the cliff, one large geological feature that remains is a glacial groove at 121st Street, which had been noted as early as 1916. The western border of the park between 122nd and 123rd Streets is taken up by 36, on a rock drop off; this occupies the former site of the ruins of Blockhouse No. 4, which was used as a source of stone until the park&#x27;s creation. A tablet was placed on the site by the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society in 1904. Furthermore, part of the cliff was destroyed in 1915.

A plateau, on the eastern side of the park, was mostly demolished during the failed Columbia University gym construction project. Today, the site includes a waterfall and a pond, built between 1989 and 1993. The waterfall is artificial and uses water pumped using motors from the city&#x27;s water system. The pond has been frequented by several species of birds, including great blue herons, night herons, red-winged blackbirds, painted turtles, and mallard ducks.

The park also contained meadows when it was constructed. These were at the south end from 110th to 114th Streets; in the central section from 116th to 120th Streets; and at the northeast corner. They were developed as playgrounds and playing fields in the mid-20th century and the rock outcroppings were destroyed. The central and northern meadows were redeveloped as playgrounds while the southern meadow was converted to sports fields.

=== Paths and plantings ===
Morningside Park was designed with many paths and plantings. The paths usually followed the topography, though there are several locations where stone steps connect paths at different locations. There are stone stairs connecting the two portions of 120th Street, and between 116th Street on the west side of the park and 114th Street on the east side. The paths were made originally of gravel, concrete, and asphalt, while the stairs were made of bluestone with rockwork edging on the outer portions. Benches, lights, railings, fences, and stone walls were added over the years; the rockwork edging was replaced. The northern meadow&#x27;s paths were rebuilt in 1940–1941, while the paths around  36 and the unbuilt Columbia gym were reconfigured or removed in the late 1960s. With the waterfall&#x27;s construction, the paths at the unbuilt gym site were rebuilt from 1989 to 1993. Some of the stairs have been renovated over the years.

The plantings in Morningside Park were designed at several stages of the park&#x27;s development. Accounts vary on whether plantings were present before the park was built; in 1871, park engineer Montgomery A. Kellogg called the area a &quot;barren piece of ground&quot;, Samuel Parsons described the site as having &quot;a considerable amount of native growth&quot;, albeit limited mainly to vines, herbs, and shrubs. Parsons also stated that because of the poor soil in the original plan of the park, &quot;fine trees&quot; could not grow there. By the 1910s, vandalism, erosion, and crowds had caused damage to many of the plantings. Major landscaping projects took place in 1929, 1941, 1962, and 2006.

== Recreational features ==

Morningside Park contains several sporting fields, which were mostly built starting in the 1930s. Two baseball fields and a basketball court are at the southern end of the park. Three other basketball courts are near the central portion of Morningside Park. To the north are two basketball courts and four handball courts. There are also children&#x27;s play structures at 110th, 113th, 116th, 118th, and 123rd Streets at the bottom of the cliff, and a restroom at 123rd Street. In addition, New York Road Runners hosts a weekly Open Run along the park&#x27;s paths.

Morningside Dog Run is an enclosed space for dog owners to bring their dogs to play. Consisting primarily of wood chips over dirt, there are two fenced-in areas. The larger section has multiple levels, separated by a step. The dog run is most easily accessible from the east at 114th Street and from the west at either 114th or 116th Streets. There is also a barbecue area at 121st Street.

The Kiel Arboretum is in the northern section of the park from 116th to 121st Streets. The design of the arboretum was based on original plans for Central Park sketched by Olmsted and Vaux in 1858. While later abandoned, these arboretum plans involved paths leading through several hundred species of trees and shrubs. The plans re-emerged when the Kiel Arboretum was built in 1998. Plantings of trees from the Magnoliaceae (magnolia) family and shrubs from the Ranunculaceae (buttercup) and Berberidaceae (barberry) families were used to start the tree collection.

Over the years, several playgrounds have been constructed at Morningside Park; there are four playgrounds within the park. The first one, at the bottom of the stairs at 114th Street, was built in 1903–1904 and demolished in 1952. A playground in the northeast corner was constructed in 1935 and renovated in 1941; it was restored several more times, including in 1992 and 2000. Another playground, built in 1955–1956 at Morningside Avenue between 116th and 119th Streets, contains facilities such as shuffleboard and basketball courts, and a playground with a wading pool, swings, slides, and a sandbox. A third play area at 113th Street contains play equipment, while a fourth facility is at 110th Street. In 2008, a new playground opened within the park at 116th Street, replacing part of the playground between 116th and 119th Streets.

== Art ==
There are three sculptures in Morningside Park, all of which date from the beginning of the 20th century. The first is the &quot;Lafayette and Washington&quot; statue (1900) by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, at the triangle between Manhattan Avenue, Morningside Avenue and 114th Street. Though dedicated in 1890, it was not brought to the triangle until 1900. The statue commemorates the alliance between the U.S. and France during the American Revolutionary War and consists of a bronze sculptural group depicting General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, both in uniform and shaking hands. The pair is atop a white marble pedestal and contains an associated bronze plaque on a gray granite base. It is an exact replica of a statue in the Place des États-Unis, Paris.

The second is the &quot;Carl Schurz Monument&quot; (1913), with a statue by Karl Bitter and setting by architect Henry Bacon. It stands on a brick plaza at Morningside Drive and West 116th Street, overlooking the park from the west, though it is officially part of the park. The statue consists of a bronze depiction of politician Carl Schurz, standing in the middle of an exedra (or semicircular recess) made of granite. The &quot;arms&quot; of the exedra contain reliefs depicting Schurz&#x27;s stature as a person who fought against slavery and for better treatment of Native Americans. Beneath the figure are carved stone reliefs flanked by bronze luminaires. The monument&#x27;s side and central relief carvings, made in stone, may have been created by Bitter&#x27;s associates and assistants, while the low granite relief carvings may have been made by the Piccirilli Brothers. The sculpture combines elements of the Archaic Greek and Austrian/Viennese Secessionist styles. The monument was unveiled to the city in 1913 and restored in the 1930s.

The third is the &quot;Seligman (Bear and Faun)&quot; fountain (1914) by Edgar Walter. It was dedicated in memory of Alfred L. Seligman, the National Highways Protective Association&#x27;s vice president. Plans for the fountain&#x27;s dedication in Morningside Park were revealed in 1911, predating Seligman&#x27;s death in a traffic accident in 1912. The fountain contains a depiction of a grotto, above which a bear hangs. Below the grotto, a faun is depicted playing the pipes. The fountain includes a drinking fountain and a dogs&#x27; drinking basin. It was restored in 1997.

== Management ==
Morningside Park is owned, operated, and managed by NYC Parks. Friends of Morningside Park, a nonprofit organization founded in 1981 to support returning the park to its original design, is the park&#x27;s primary advocacy and community stewardship organization. Since its founding, the group has rehabilitated the park through volunteer work, as well as donations for staffing and equipment. The organization fell apart between 1996 and 1998 following the death of founder Thomas Kiel. In 2001, around fourteen major public events were organized by volunteers in the park, including festivals, concerts, and holiday celebrations. By 2005, Friends of Morningside Park had approximately 1,000 volunteers. The organization receives a moderate amount of money compared to similar nonprofits that maintain New York City public parks. , it received about $50,000 a year in private donations, and the largest-ever single donation was $10,000.

The Central Park Conservancy, which maintains nearby Central Park, also provides maintenance support and staff training programs for other public parks in New York City, including Morningside Park. In 2005, the Conservancy created the Historic Harlem Parks initiative, providing horticultural and maintenance support and mentoring in Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, and Marcus Garvey Park.

<text>In chess, the Wing Gambit is an opening in which White plays an early b4, deflecting an enemy pawn or bishop from c5 so as to regain control of d4, an important central square. Or an opening in which Black plays an early ...b5.

The most common Wing Gambit is in the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5 2.b4). The most important Wing Gambit is the Evans Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4), treated separately.
==Against the Sicilian Defence==
The Wing Gambit in the Sicilian Defence runs 1.e4 c5 2.b4. After Black takes with 2...cxb4, the usual continuation is 3.a3 bxa3 (3...d5 is more recently considered superior, when White must avoid 4.exd5 Qxd5 5.axb4 Qe5+ winning the rook, a blunder actually seen in tournament play in Shirazi–Peters, Berkeley 1984; instead 5.Nf3 is better) and now the main line is 4.Nxa3, though 4.Bxa3 and 4.d4 are also seen. It is also possible to decline (or at least delay acceptance of) the gambit with 2...d5.

For his pawn, White gets quicker and a central advantage, but it is not generally considered one of White&#x27;s better choices against the Sicilian and it is virtually never seen at the professional level. Amongst amateurs it is more common, though still not so popular as other systems.

After Black&#x27;s 2...cxb4, another popular third move alternative for White is 3.d4. Grandmasters George Koltanowski, David Bronstein and World Champion Alexander Alekhine have played this line. 

White can postpone the gambit one move by playing the Wing Gambit Deferred, playing 2.Nf3 followed by 3.b4. The deferred Wing Gambit is considered to be best when Black responds 2...e6. The Portsmouth Gambit runs 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.b4, where Black is disinclined to refuse the gambit due to the positional threat 4.b5, displacing the knight and disrupting Black&#x27;s smooth development.

It is also possible to prepare the gambit by playing 2.a3 followed by 3.b4.

== Against the French Defence ==
The Wing Gambit can also be played against the French Defence, although this is largely refuted at the grandmaster level. One line, as popularised by Gotham Chess, goes 1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4, and Black often takes cxb4, followed by White&#x27;s a3 with a further gambit of a pawn in exchange for quick development of the minor pieces, and/or d4 and c3 to solidify the .

Black usually plays Nf6 at some point, and White often chooses to play aggressively on the , with the option of not castling and keeping the rook on the h-file to support a pawn storm.

== In the Benoni Defence ==
Black offers the b-pawn in the Benko Gambit: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5. 

==In other openings==
A related idea is found in the Caro–Kann Defence after 1.e4 c6 2.Ne2 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4; however, Black can immediately achieve an advantage by playing 4...d4! (this move is also strong in the second French line given above). Even rarer is the Wing Gambit in the Bishop&#x27;s Opening, 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bc5 3.b4, which has some resemblance to the Evans Gambit.

There are several other &quot;Wing Gambits&quot; in various openings, but they are rare and not as notable as the openings mentioned above:
* In the English Opening: 1.c4 c5 2.b4, or 1.c4 b5 (the Jaenisch Gambit) 
* In the Marshall Gambit of the Scandinavian Defence: 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.d4 g6 4.c4 b5
* In the Ware Opening: 1.a4 b5 2.axb5 Bb7

<doc id="875991" wikidata="Q228951" url="?curid=875991" title="Sobekneferu">
<text>Sobekneferu or Neferusobek ( meaning &#x27;Beauty of Sobek&#x27;) was the first confirmed queen regnant (or &#x27;female king&#x27;) of ancient Egypt and the last pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. She ascended to the throne following the death of Amenemhat IV, possibly her brother or husband, though their relationship is unproven. Instead, she asserted legitimacy through her father Amenemhat III. Her reign lasted 3 years, 10 months, and 24 days, according to the Turin King List.

Distinguishing herself from prior female rulers, Sobekneferu adopted the full royal titulary. She was also the first ruler to associate herself with the crocodile god Sobek through her name. Contemporary evidence for her reign is scant. There are a few partial statues – one with her face – and inscriptions that have been uncovered. It is assumed that the Northern Mazghuna pyramid was intended for her, though this assignment is speculative with no firm evidence to confirm it. The monument was abandoned immediately after its substructure was completed. A papyrus discovered in Harageh mentions a place called &quot;Sekhem Sobekneferu&quot; that may refer to the pyramid. Her rule is attested on several king lists.

== Family ==
Sobekneferu is thought to be the daughter of Pharaoh Amenemhat III, but her mother&#x27;s identity is unknown. Amenemhat III had two known wives, Aat and an unnamed queen, both buried in his pyramid at Dahshur. He had at least one other daughter, Neferuptah, who had a burial at his second pyramid at Hawara that was eventually moved to her own pyramid. Neferuptah appears to have been groomed as Amenemhat III&#x27;s heir as she had her name enclosed in a cartouche. Evidence of burials of three other princesses – Hathorhotep, Nubhotepet, and Sithathor – were found at the Dahshur complex, but it is not clear whether these princesses were his daughters as the complex was used for royal burials throughout the Thirteenth Dynasty.

Amenemhat III&#x27;s eventual heir, Amenemhat IV, is attested to be the son of Hetepti, though her titulary lacks reference to her being a &#x27;King&#x27;s Wife&#x27;. The relationship between Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu remains unclear. According to the ancient historian Manetho in &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; they were brother and sister. According to Gae Callender they were also probably married. Although, neither the title of &#x27;King&#x27;s Wife&#x27; nor &#x27;King&#x27;s Sister&#x27; are attested for Sobekneferu. Sobekneferu&#x27;s accession may have been motivated by the lack of a male heir for Amenemhat IV. However, two kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Sonbef, have been speculated to be sons of his based on their shared nomen &#x27;Amenemhat&#x27;. If this is the case, Sobekneferu may have taken the throne after Amenemhat IV&#x27;s death, because she viewed those potential offspring of late king as illegitimate.

== Female kingship ==
Sobekneferu was the first confirmed woman to rule Egypt in her own right as &#x27;female king&#x27; and the first to adopt the full royal titulary. She was also the first ruler associated with the crocodile god Sobek by name, whose identity appears in both her birth and throne names. Kara Cooney views ancient Egypt as unique in allowing women to acquire formal – and absolute – power. She posits that women were elevated to the throne during crises to guide the civilization and maintain social order. Though, she also notes that, this elevation to power was illusory. Women acquired the throne as temporary replacements for a male leader; their reigns were regularly targeted for erasure by their successors; and overall, Egyptian society was oppressive to women. 

In ancient Egyptian historiography, there is some evidence for other female rulers. As early as the First Dynasty, Merneith is proposed to have ruled as regent for her son. In the Fifth Dynasty, Setibhor may have been a female king regnant based on the manner her monuments were targeted for destruction. Another candidate, Nitocris, is generally considered to have ruled in the Sixth Dynasty, though there is little proof of her historicity and she is not mentioned before the Eighteenth Dynasty. The kingship of Nitocris may instead be a Greek legend and the name may originate from an incorrect translation of Neitiqerty Siptah.

== Reign ==
The Middle Kingdom was in decline by the time of Sobekneferu&#x27;s accession. The peak of the Middle Kingdom is attributed to Senusret III and Amenemhat III. Senusret III formed the basis for the legendary character Sesostris described by Manetho and Herodotus. He led military expeditions into Nubia and into Syria-Palestine and built a mudbrick pyramid as his monument. He reigned for 39 years, as evidenced by an inscription in Abydos, where he was buried. Amenemhat III, in contrast, presided over a peaceful Egypt that consisted of monumental constructions, the development of Faiyum, numerous mining expeditions, and the building of two pyramids at Dahshur and at Hawara. His reign lasted at least 45 years, probably longer. Nicolas Grimal notes that such long reigns contributed to the end of the Twelfth Dynasty, but without the collapse that ended the Old Kingdom. Amenemhat IV ruled for nine or ten years. There is little information regarding his reign.

It is to this backdrop that Sobekneferu acquired the throne. She reigned for around four years, but as with her predecessor, there are few surviving records. Her death brought a close to the Twelfth Dynasty and began the Second Intermediate Period spanning the following two centuries. 

This period is poorly understood owing to the paucity of references to the rulers of the time. She was succeeded by either Sobekhotep I or Wegaf, who inaugurated the Thirteenth Dynasty. Stephen Quirke proposed, based on the numerosity of kingships and brevity of their rule, that a rotating succession of kings from Egypt&#x27;s most powerful families took the throne. They retained Itj-tawy as their capital through the Thirteenth Dynasty. Their role, however, was relegated to a reduced status and power rested within the administration. It is generally accepted that Egypt remained unified until late into the dynasty. Kim Ryholt contends that the Fourteenth Dynasty instead arose in the Nile Delta at the end of Sobekneferu&#x27;s reign as a rival to the Thirteenth. Thomas Schneider argues that the evidence for this hypothesis is weak.

== Attestations ==
Only a small collection of sources attest to Sobekneferu&#x27;s rule as pharaoh of Egypt.

=== Contemporary evidence ===
====Graffiti====
In Nubia, a graffito in the fortress of Kumma records the height of the Nile inundation at during her third regnal year. Another inscription discovered in the Eastern Desert records &quot;year 4, second month of the Season of the Emergence&quot;.

====Cylinder and scarab seals====
The British Museum has a fine cylinder seal (EA16581) bearing her name and royal titulary in its collection. The seal is made of glazed steatite and is long with a diameter of . The British Museum also possesses an inscribed scarab (EA66159), measuring by and in height, made of glazed steatite bearing the name of Sobekneferu.

====Statuary====

A handful of headless statues of Sobekneferu have been identified. In one quartzite image, she blends feminine and masculine dress with an inscription reading &#x27;daughter of Re(?), of his body, Sobekneferu, may she live like Re forever&#x27;. On her torso rests a pendant modelled on that worn by Senusret III. Three basalt statues of the female king were found in Tell ed-Dab&#x27;a; two depict her in a seated posture, another shows her kneeling. In one, she is depicted trampling the Nine Bows, representing the subjugation of Egypt&#x27;s enemies. The three statues appear to be life-sized. One statue with her head is known. The bust was held in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin but was lost during World War II. Its existence is confirmed by photographic images and plaster casts. It fits on top of the lower part of a seated statuette discovered at Semna which bears the royal symbol &quot;smꜣ tꜣwy&quot; on the side of the throne. The lower half is held at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

====Buildings====
There is evidence that she had structures built in Heracleopolis Magna and added to the Pyramid of Amenemhat III in Hawara. She left inscriptions on four granite columns found at a temple in Kom el-Akârib, while a further ten granite beams there may date to the same period. Her monumental works consistently associate her with Amenemhat III rather than Amenemhat IV, supporting the theory that she was the royal daughter of Amenemhat III and perhaps only a stepsister to Amenemhat IV, whose mother was not royal. Contemporary sources from her reign show that Sobekneferu adopted only the &#x27;King&#x27;s Daughter&#x27; title, which further supports this hypothesis. An example of such an inscription comes from a limestone block of &#x27;the Labyrinth&#x27; of the Pyramid at Hawara. It reads &#x27;Beloved of &quot;Dḥdḥt&quot; the good god &quot;Nỉ-mꜣꜥt-rꜥ&quot; [Amenemhat III] given [...] * Daughter of Re, Sobekneferu lord of Shedet, given all life&#x27;. The inscription is also the only known reference to a goddess &quot;Dḥdḥt&quot;. By contrast, Amenemhat IV&#x27;s name does not appear at Hawara.

====Uncertain attestations====
In Israel, a possible reference to Sobekneferu before she became a ruler is found on the base of a statue discovered in Gezer. This statue bears her name and is identified as a representation of a &quot;king&#x27;s daughter&quot;. However, it may also refer to a daughter of Senusret I or another unknown Sobekneferu. A damaged statuette (MET 65.59.1) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has been suggested to represent Sobekneferu, though this assignment is unverified. The schist bust depicts a woman in a wig, wearing a crown composed of a uraeus cobra and two vultures with outstretched wings which is of unknown iconography, and the ḥb-sd cloak. A headless black basalt or granite sphinx discovered by Édouard Naville in Qantir bearing a damaged inscription is also assigned to Sobekneferu.

=== Non-contemporary sources ===
In the Thutmosid period, she is mentioned on the Karnak list of early Egyptian kings. In the Ramesside period, she is mentioned in the Saqqara Tablet, and Turin King List, but is conspicuously excluded from the Abydos King List. Her exclusion, along with all other female kings, pharaohs of the First and Second Intermediate Periods, and of the Amarna Period, is an indicator of whom Ramesses II and Seti I viewed as the legitimate rulers of Egypt. She is credited in the Turin Canon with a reign of 3 years, 10 months, and 24 days. In the Hellenistic period, she is mentioned by Manetho as &#x27;Scemiophris&#x27; (&quot;Σκεμιoφρις&quot;), where she is credited with a reign of four years.

== Burial ==
Sobekneferu&#x27;s tomb has not yet been positively identified. A place called &quot;Sekhem Sobekneferu&quot; is mentioned on a papyrus found at Harageh which may be the name of her pyramid. On a funerary stela from Abydos, now in Marseille, there is mention of a storeroom administrator of Sobekneferu named Heby. The stela dates to the 13th Dynasty and attests to an ongoing funerary cult.

The Northern Mazghuna pyramid is assumed to be her monument. There is, however, no clear evidence to confirm this assignment and the pyramid may date to a period well after the end of the Twelfth Dynasty. Only its substructure was completed; construction of the superstructure and wider temple complex was never begun. The passages of the substructure had a complex plan. A stairway descended south from the east side of the pyramid leading to a square chamber which connected to the next sloping passage leading west to a portcullis. The portcullis consisted of a quartzite block intended to slide into and block the passage. Beyond the passage wound through several more turns and a second smaller portcullis before terminating at the antechamber. South of this lay the burial chamber which was almost entirely occupied by a quartzite monolith which acted as the vessel for a sarcophagus. In a deep recess lay a quartzite lid which was to be slid into place over the coffin and then locked into place by a stone slab blocking it. The builders had all exposed surfaces painted red and added lines of black paint. A causeway leading to the pyramid was built of mudbrick, which must have been used by the workers. Though the burial place had been constructed, no burial was interred at the site.

<text>Cascades Inc. is a Canadian company that produces, converts, and markets packaging and tissue products composed mainly of recycled fibres. Cascades employs around 10,000 people in more than 70 operating units in North America. It was founded in 1964.

==History==
The Lemaire family founded the Drummond Pulp &amp; Fibre company in 1957, which recovered household and industrial waste. In 1964, Antonio Lemaire and his sons officially ventured into the production of paper made from recycled fibres when they took over a mill in Kingsey Falls, Quebec from the Dominion Paper Co.. Papier Cascades Inc. was born of that transaction.

In 1971, Cascades began its expansion in Kingsey Falls with the creation of Cascades Forma-Pak, its first moulded-pulp mill to use 100% recycled fibres. From 1972 to 1977: the company started Papier Kingsey Falls (multi-layer board), Cascades Industries (tissue paper), Plastiques Cascades and Cascades Conversion. In 1976, the Lemaire brothers started the production of container board in Cabano, Québec.

In 1983 Cascades&#x27; shares began trading on the Montreal Stock Exchange. That same year, its entry into the United States began with the start-up of Cascades Industries Inc. in Rockingham, North Carolina. In Québec, Cascades began producing kraft paper in East Angus, Quebec and acquired a boxboard plant in Jonquière, Quebec, the following year.

In 1985, the company made its entry into Europe with the acquisition of a boxboard plant in La Rochette, France. This new expansion took shape in 1986 with the creation of Cascades S.A. and the acquisition of another French boxboard mill in Blendecques. From 1987 to 1989, other mills located in Sweden and Belgium became part of the Cascades Group as well: Djupafors AB in Sweden and Kartonfabriek van Duffel NV in Belgium. The Belgian mill was renamed Cascades Duffel NV but ceased its production in 1993 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other European mills of the group. Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-president of the board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003). After a final stop of her so-called activities in 2005 (due to fiscal controles in other Cascades mills in France and Germany), Cascades Duffel NV was &quot;liquidated&quot; with immediate effect on 28 December 2011.

==Expansion==
In 1985, Cascades opened a Research and Development Center in 1985 in Kingsey Falls. The facility became the largest private Canadian Research and Development Center in the pulp and paper industry.

Cascades then created Cascades Énergie. This subsidiary controlled a brand new cogeneration plant powered by natural gas, the first in Canada. Its mandate was to provide the energy required by all the Cascades mills in Kingsey Falls. The success of this project enabled Cascades to invest further in the prospective energy sector with the acquisition of Boralex in 1995. Today, Boralex&#x27;s shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in which Cascades holds a 34% interest.

Cascades Énergie paved the way for a series of acquisitions in which Cascades&#x27; activities were largely diversified. The purchase of Rolland and Paperboard Industries Corporation in 1992, Perkins Papers in 1995, Provincial Papers in 1997 and, that same year, the creation of Norampac in partnership with Domtar, led to the restructuring of Cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard, tissue paper, fine papers and boxboard.

On an international level, Cascades&#x27; expansion continued in Europe with the acquisition of the boxboard mill in Arnsberg in Germany in 1997 and the start-up of a sheeting operation in Wednesbury in the United Kingdom in 1998.

In 2001, Cascades acquired mills in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. Two years later, the group set up operations in Alberta, New York, Arizona, Oregon and Tennessee. In 2004, the boxboard sector stood out with the acquisition of Dopaco Inc., a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry. Norampac proceeded with the implementation, between 2001 and 2006, of several ultra-modern corrugated cardboard mills in Canada and in the United States.

In 2004, Cascades created in Europe four new companies in Luxembourg (Cascades Luxembourg Sarl, Norampac Luxembourg Sarl, Cascades Hungary Ltd Luxembourg Branch and Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch). Beginning of 2010 Cascades Canada Inc Luxembourg Branch was created, and with the closure of Cascade(s) Duffel NV in Belgium, the closure of Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch and the existing Pulp &amp; Paper Cascades NV (become BV ?) in the Netherlands, that carries to four the number of companies in service in 2012 into the Benelux without any co-worker who works on it. Norampac Luxembourg Sarl was closed in September 2008 by incorporation into Cascades Luxembourg Sarl (new capital February 2012: USD 64 933 600,00) and beginning of February 2012, Cascades Canada Inc Luxemburg Branch changed her name to Cascades Canada ULC Luxembourg Branch.

In summer 2017, Cascades opened a new mill in Scappoose, Oregon. The Cascades Tissue Group Oregon converting plant employed 80 full-time workers in the production of its paper products.

==Recent history==
During the 2000s, Cascades closed mills in Thunder Bay, Montréal, Red Rock, Pickering, Buffalo, New York and Boissy-le-Châtel. In 2005, the company proceeded with the sale of its fine papers (Cascades Resources) and its tissue paper (Wood Wyant) distribution assets.

With the purchase of Domtar&#x27;s shares in Norampac in 2006 and the merger of its European boxboard operations with Reno de Medici in 2007, Cascade has consolidated its position as a leader in the containerboard and boxboard sectors.

In 2008, North-American boxboard activities were integrated into Norampac&#x27;s cartonboard activities. In addition to creating synergy, this integration led to the creation of a larger packaging group.

In 2011, Cascades named Mario Plourde chief operating officer, enabling Alain Lemaire, president and chief executive officer, to devote more time to the strategic vision of the company. Also in 2011, Cascades sold Dopaco Inc., its paper cup and carton converting business for the quick-service restaurant and foodservice industries, to Reynolds Group Holdings Limited.

Cascades is a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada. Cascades is focusing on products that contain a high percentage of recycled fibres.

In 2003 and 2004, Cascades was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by MediaCorp Canada Inc. It was also awarded the same title in October 2008.

In 2017, Cascades exited its position in Boralex by selling it to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (the Caisse) for an amount of $ 287.5 million.

In 2021, Cascades announced the monetization of its controlling interest in RDM Group, ending 35 years of operations in Europe.

<doc id="876002" wikidata="Q7619439" url="?curid=876002" title="Stoneygate">
<text>Stoneygate is part of the City of Leicester, England.

Situated on the south-east side of the city some two miles from the centre, Stoneygate is a mainly residential suburb characterised by its large Victorian houses. It straddles the London Road which connects Leicester with the town of Market Harborough and was formerly the main route for horse-drawn carriages between Leicester and London. It gives its name to Stoneygate ward, which also includes parts of Evington Valley and Highfields, whilst the south-eastern parts of Stoneygate are counted in the Knighton ward of Leicester City Council.

==History==

The name &#x27;Stoneygate&#x27; originates in Old English as &quot;stone road&quot;, and Ordnance Survey maps show the former route of the Roman Gartree Road leading south-east from Leicester towards Little Stretton, Medbourne, Corby and eventually, Colchester.

Stoneygate&#x27;s historical significance was recognised when it was designated a conservation area by Leicester City Council in 1978. The Stoneygate Conservation Area (which also includes properties in the adjacent suburb of Clarendon Park) is bounded by Victoria Park Road to the north, Queens Road to the west, Stoneygate Road to the east and Shirley Road to the south. A map is available on the Stoneygate Conservation Area Society website (see external links below).

There are many examples of well-preserved Victorian family homes in Stoneygate as well as slightly later Edwardian buildings and -in the southern section- homes built after the Great War of 1914–18 and influenced by more modern architectural styles, notably Art Deco. Particularly worthy of note are &#x27;Brookfield&#x27; and &#x27;The Firs&#x27; on London Road; two remaining examples of the oldest and grandest homes built by wealthy commercial families to imitate the country estates of the local gentry. There are no less than twelve Grade II listed residential properties. These include &#x27;The White House&#x27; in North Avenue designed in a variation of the Arts &amp; Crafts style by Ernest Gimson in 1898 and 22 Avenue Road, designed in the modernist style by Fello Atkinson and Brenda Walker of James Cubitt and Partners in 1953. The Stoneygate Conservation Area Society, a group of local volunteers with a current membership of 175 households, exists to inform the public about the Conservation Area, its history and proposed developments that will affect its future.

==Profile of one Stoneygate house==
No 58 Stoneygate Road stands on the corner of Aber Road, and is a large three-storey red brick Victorian building in the gothic style. It was built in 1880 to plans by local architect William Beaumont Smith to relocate the &#x27;Home for Penitent Females&#x27; from its previous premises at 16 Blue Boar Lane, Leicester. &#x27;The Home&#x27;, as it was known, was a charity run by a Committee of local philanthropists and religious leaders to provide welfare and reform for unmarried mothers (often referred to as &#x27;fallen women&#x27;). It is assumed that the women&#x27;s children would have been taken from their mothers and would be treated as orphans or adopted soon after birth. The charity would generate income by taking in washing which would be done by the inmates.

The original plans are dated 23 July 1880 and appear to have been submitted for approval on 21 August that year and include a section of building up to No. 60 Stoneygate Road, which was never completed. The main three-storey component provided a kitchen, dining room and matron&#x27;s office on the ground floor, with two floors of dormitories, individual bedrooms and bathrooms above. In an &#x27;L&#x27;shaped single storey projection to the rear was the laundry and associated out buildings. A coal yard, carriage house and stable were added in 1882, also to designs by Beaumont-Smith.

William Beaumont-Smith (WBS) appears to have begun his career working for Parsons &amp; Dain who were quite a successful firm of local architects in the early Victorian period, William Parsons being responsible for some of Leicester&#x27;s grand civic buildings including the Leicestershire and Rutland County Asylum (later part of the University of Leicester) and the Theatre Royal (now demolished). They were also responsible for early parts of the Leicester Royal Infirmary. By 1855 Parsons seems to have disappeared from the partnership and WBS has taken his place; the firm now being called Dain &amp; Smith. They are recorded in local directories as practising from 21 St. Martins in Leicester and during this time WBS was resident in London Rd (Stockdale Terrace and 51 London Rd – next to the Hind Hotel, opposite the railway station).

By 1876 WBS was on his own, practising from Greyfriars Chambers, 7 Friar Lane, Leicester, where he continued to work until his death in 1899. He was also Leicestershire County Surveyor from this time until his death. His private residences may indicate his changing fortunes: in 1876–77 he was resident at No. 2 New Walk. By 1878 he was at &#x27;Trentham Villa&#x27; in Granville Road and remained here until 1881. This suggests he was doing very well indeed – they were (and some remain) grand houses overlooking Victoria Park at the southern end of New Walk. However, by 1889 he had moved to 61 Evington Rd – still nice houses but nothing like as grand and Granville Rd. He remained in Evington Rd until the late 1890s – in 1899 he was living at a property was called &#x27;Campsie&#x27;, 11 Alexandra Road in Stoneygate.
By the 1930s No. 58 Stoneygate Road had become &#x27;The Home School&#x27; and some alterations were made including the addition of the single storey recreation room adjoining No.60 and the conversion of part of the outbuildings to a chapel. In 1942 a further single storey building was added to the rear of the recreation room as an air raid shelter. In the late 1950s the building changed hands again, this time passing to the NHS for use as a new community-based rehabilitation facility for women (later mixed) with learning disabilities. The facility, known as the Stoneygate Hostel, formed part of the Glenfrith group of hospitals along with Stretton Hall hospital. The Hostel was closed by the NHS in the mid-1990s and the building was occupied by the Leicester Montessori Grammar School until it abruptly closed in July 2016.

==Stoneygate Conservation Area and Listed Buildings==

The Stoneygate Conservation Area was established in 1978 to protect the character and appearance of the suburb. Described as &#x27;Leicester’s best-surviving Victorian suburb&#x27;, it covers , much larger than Leicester&#x27;s other conservation areas. The earliest houses, along the London Road, were built from 1840 onwards, in what was then the parish of Knighton, outside the borough boundary. Initially these were built by and for prosperous Leicester industrialists. From 1865, speculative builders began a larger scale expansion, including the opening up of side roads. The substantial houses that were built during the 19th and early 20th centuries included many examples by the city’s best-known architects including Joseph Goddard, Stockdale Harrison, Redfern &amp; Sawday, James Tait and Isaac Barradale. In addition to the restrictions and safeguards afforded by the Conservation area as a whole, there are 13 buildings that are individually listed, which provides a higher degree of legal protection of the character and setting of the buildings concerned.

===Demolished mansions===
Statutory planning protection came too late for at least 30 of Stoneygate&#x27;s 19th century mansions. These large buildings in extensive grounds proved too tempting a target for profit in the mid-20th century, when substantial blocks of flats or estates of houses could replace a single unwanted mansion. Several of the earliest houses in the suburb were lost in this way, including &#x27;The Stoney Gate&#x27;, a 17th-century farmhouse converted into a mansion in the 1820s, demolished in 1962. The Shrubbery (1845) was demolished to build the Stoneygate Court flats in 1934 and Elmsleigh Hall, built in 1874 for John Stafford, a Leicester cheese and provisions merchant, was demolished in 1935 to make way for Elmsleigh Avenue.

==Amenities==
Stoneygate is well-provided with its own local amenities. In addition to the medical practice on Springfield Road and the St John the Baptist Primary School on East Avenue, there are several private schools (including Montessori), nurseries and dental practices. Stoneygate also has a wide variety of fashionable shops and boutiques on Allendale Road and Francis Street.

==Transport links==
Leicester&#x27;s London Road railway station is a fifteen-minute journey by bus, car or taxi.

Arriva Midlands operate Sapphire routes 31/31A/31E along the main London Road with buses up to every 10 minutes into Oadby and City Centre.

Centrebus operate the UHL &quot;Hospital Hopper&quot; services connecting with Leicester Royal Infirmary, Glenfield Hospital and the Leicester General Hospital, it serves a stop on Stoughton Road.

==Local and National Government==
Stoneygate gives its name to a Leicester City Council ward that also includes parts of Evington Valley and Highfields. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 20,390. It is part of the Leicester South parliamentary constituency whose MP is currently Shockat Adam Patel (Independent).

<text>Cambior Inc. was a Canadian based international gold producer with operations, development projects and exploration activities in the Americas. Cambior&#x27;s shares traded on the Toronto (TSX) and American (AMEX) stock exchanges under the symbol &quot;CBJ&quot;. Cambior&#x27;s warrants &quot;CBJ.WT.C&quot; traded on the TSX. In November 2006 IAMGOLD acquired 100% of Cambior shares.
==Formation==
The company results from the privatization of the major discoveries in Quebec by Soquem, the Crown Company in 1986: Mine Doyon, Ressources Aiguebelle, Sullivan, and 50% of the Niobec mine near Chicoutimi. 

==Omai mine acid spill==
In August 1995 there was an acid spill from the Omai mine tailings dam in the river by the Canadian mining company Cambior in the Essequibo region of Guyana. An estimated 4 000 000 m³ of waste laced with cyanide, other heavy metals and other pollutants were released into the river causing much destruction. Thousands of dead fish were found floating on the river used by Amerindians, the Native Indians of Guyana. An estimated 23,000 people who live in the region surrounding the river, depend on the river for drinking water, bathing and fishing. A public interest group filed a class-action lawsuit against Cambior in 1997 in Québec Superior Court seeking damages on behalf of the Guyanese victims of the spill. The Omai Mine is wholly owned by Omai Gold Mines Limited (OGML). At the time of the spill, Cambior owned 65% of this company and the balance was owned by Golden Star Resources and the Government of Guyana. In 2002, Cambior acquired Golden Star&#x27;s interest in OGML, thereby obtaining a 95% ownership interest in the company.

The Québec Superior Court dismissed the case in August 1998, on the grounds that the courts in Guyana were in a better position to hear the case. A lawsuit against Cambior was filed in Guyana, but it was dismissed by the High Court of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Guyana in 2002. A new suit was filed against Cambior in 2003 in Guyana again seeking US$2billion in damages for the effects of the 1995 spill. In October 2006, the High Court of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Guyana ordered the dismissal of the 2003 action and ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants&#x27; legal costs.

==Operations==
The company&#x27;s operations included sites in French Guiana, Guyana, Peru and Suriname in South America, and Mali among other countries in West Africa.
==Acquisition==
Cambior was acquired by Iamgold in November 2006.

<text>Confessions of an Eco-Warrior is a book written in 1991 by Dave Foreman.

== About ==

Dave Foreman was the New Mexico lobbyist for The Wilderness Society in the 1970s. Disillusioned by the lack of progress in safeguarding the environment in the United States, particularly after a wilderness inventory by the United States Forest Service known as RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation), he was a co-founder of the environmental organization known as Earth First! (EF) in the 1980s. EF originally mixed innovative publicity, such as rolling a plastic &quot;crack&quot; down Glen Canyon Dam, with far-reaching wilderness proposals that went far beyond what the mainstream environmental groups were willing to advocate, and with conservation biology research from a biocentric perspective. Later however, after about 1987, EF became primarily associated with non-violent direct action activities.

Foreman took his inspiration for Earth First! from Edward Abbey&#x27;s book &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; which is a fictional account of a gang of four individuals who take on a pointless yet deeply symbolic effort to destroy and thus halt the machines of human expansion and putative &quot;progress&quot; in the American Southwest.

In 1989 Foreman was implicated in the FBI conspiracy known as THERMCON wherein four activists in Prescott, Arizona, who were only peripherally connected with EF, were enticed by undercover FBI agent Michael Fain (alias Mike Tait) who talked them into the destruction of a power line in the State of Arizona. Foreman himself wasn&#x27;t involved, however he was arrested and indicted along with the four.

His book &quot;Confessions of an Eco-Warrior&quot; is partly an autobiographical account of RARE II and his disillusionment with the mainstream environmental movement, the early years of Earth First!, the FBI entrapment, and his ultimate disillusionment with what Earth First! became. It is also partly a statement of his views on wilderness and the state of the environmental movement.

In the book he expressed his view that Earth First!, by 1990, had largely run its course, and was starting to attract new members who took the group in a more countercultural and left-wing direction than he was comfortable associating with. The defining moments for Foreman, according to the book, were when some activists under the Earth First! banner held a &quot;puke-in&quot; at a shopping mall, when Edward Abbey was subjected to harsh criticism and heckling by some younger newcomers to EF when he attended the 1987 EF rendezvous (Foreman and the other old guard of EF, who revered Abbey, were horrified that he would receive that sort of treatment at an EF gathering), and when some Earth First! funds were diverted to launch a punk-style zine called &quot;Live Wild or Die&quot;, which among other things espoused anarchism and attacked Foreman&#x27;s and Abbey&#x27;s views on some controversial issues then being debated within EF.

While Foreman and most of the rest of the old guard of EF severed their ties to the group in 1990, he remains an environmental activist. At the time &quot;Confessions&quot; was published, he had just launched a new magazine, &quot;Wild Earth&quot; (intended as a replacement for the 1980s-era &quot;Earth First! Journal&quot;), and was soon to launch a new environmental group, The Wildlands Project.

<doc id="876008" wikidata="Q7247226" url="?curid=876008" title="Process-based management">
<text>Process-based management is a management approach that views a business as a collection of processes, managed to achieve a desired result. Processes are managed and improved by the organisation for the purpose of achieving its vision, mission and core values. A clear correlation between processes and vision supports the company in planning strategies, structuring business and using sufficient resources to achieve long-term success.

From a process perspective, an organisation regards its business as a system of vision-achieving vertical processes rather than specific activities and tasks of individual functions. The system is not a method or tool for a particular process, but a holistic approach to manage all of an organisation&#x27;s processes. To manage processes effectively the organisation must have an effective team network and full knowledge of their vision.

The general management system focuses on specific work-knowledge and direct solutions for cost and budget; on the other hand, process based management applies these financial measurements but in an operational way considering how each performance affects the company as an amalgam of different processes. As a result of recent advances in technology and increased international competition, more companies aim for better methods of grouping and integrating organisational activities.

==Vision, mission and values==

Vision, mission and core values are three crucial factors to manage an organisation from a process perspective. Considering the vision, mission and values as a direction of their business, an organisation can build their corporate strategy and determine the processes they will take into account. As a result, the organisation obtains strengths and competitiveness among other companies.

First, the vision is an aspirational purpose what the organisation would like to achieve in the long run. The vision leads the company to challenge various tasks and develop its own business strategy. In other words, the organisation considers vision as a motivation to build a business structure, determine strategic plans and manage human resources. Therefore, the company carries out &quot;vision-achieving operations&quot; as their primary goals.

Mission is a fundamental purpose of a company that remains unchanged over time. The mission provides a guidance for decision making and gives a path to successful results. For instance, mission is different from a vision in that mission is a something to be achieved whereas a vision is something to be aimed for achievement.

Core values are principles that help companies to determine whether their actions and decisions are right or wrong. Values are essential to making decisions and sustaining the company&#x27;s long-term success.

==Advantages==

* Documenting a process provides a clear guideline of how organisation improves their processes and performances over time.
* Process based management measures the full set of activities in one business. For instance, it focuses on internal processes such as customer satisfaction, quality of product and security as well as financial results including revenues, profits, costs, and budget.
* Understanding of the correlations between business processes avoids taking wrong decisions. It reduces costs, time and resources wasting on unnecessary things.
* Analysing the processes, an organisation will be able to predict sources of hazard and choose right decisions.
* The system protects intellectual capital of the organisation. Monitoring the development of processes, the organisation can analyse risks and its weakness.
* Focusing on continuous improvement and customer’s requirements, the organisation improves customer services which deliver value to its customers.
* Evaluating the process assures the results a company expecting to obtain.
* Process based management is an integration of both input and output in business process. It controls personnel, technical and financial resources in a holistic viewpoint.
* The organisation can improve IT system that reduces unnecessary complexity and improves the quality of performance measurement.
* Analysing processes and implementing new objects if required, the organisation deal with fast changes in demand.

==Stages==

===Documenting the process===

To manage its business from a process based perspective, an organisation requires to understand what defines the process and which activities they consist of.

A business consists of different departments in charge of specific jobs or functions. Therefore, the processes support these managerial sectors and transform successful outputs. Then a process team performs a set of sequential tasks to analyse whether the organisation delivers useful outputs to the customers.

Basically, processes are built by information that indicates the current state of company and research data such as customer satisfaction. The information includes customer-based agreement, management documentation, purchasing manuals and flow charts. For instance, the flow chart is a useful information in order to control the flow of processes and list several steps and activities in detail.

===Analysing process performance===

Analysed and clarified processes are allowed to implement on the actual business. Then, an organisation monitors its business and improves the overall stage of process.

To evaluate the sequence of process, measurement is an essential element that shows results of process performance with numerical and comparative data. In other words, organisations obtain a relevant analysis using the measurements that can be shown as graphical representations such as pie charts, bar charts, cause-and-effect analysis, and gap analysis.

Many organisations highly depend on data and visual analysis processed by information system. For this reason, organisation must obtain accurate analysis based on exact data and must be cautious for mistaken output that impacts whole process of their business.

As a result, the measurements help the company to analyse current state of performance and give guidance for the firm’s sustainable improvements.

===Implementing improvements===

Having designed the processes of management system and analysed the performances using useful measurements, the final step is how to improve the system and maintain its effectiveness. Therefore, implementing the improvements is a key activity to examine the processes and improve the flow of the management system.

An organisation determines which part of processes must be improved and modified. It analyses how each process influences a set of activities and applies the improvements to some parts of system. The purpose of implementation is to operate its business strategically and to deliver sufficient resources. In effect, the process based management results in outputs that satisfy their customers and develop the business itself.
