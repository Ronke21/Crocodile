<text>Jodie Clare Henry, (born 17 November 1983) is an Australian former competitive swimmer, Olympic gold medallist at the 2004 Summer Olympics and former world-record holder.

==Swimming career==

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Henry won the women&#x27;s 100 metre freestyle as well as being a member of the Australian teams that won both the 4×100-metre freestyle relay and the 4×100-metre medley relay. Later that year, she won silver at the Pan Pacific Championships in the 50- and 100-metre freestyle, and helped Australian teams to victory over the Americans in the freestyle and medley relays.

In 2003, Henry won the 100-metre silver medal, and picked up bronze medals in both the 4×100-metre freestyle and 4×100-metre medley relays at the FINA World Championships in Barcelona.

===2004 Summer Olympics===
At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Henry anchored the Australian women&#x27;s 4×100-metre freestyle relay team that won the gold in world record time. She then competed in the individual 100-metre freestyle, breaking the previous world record time of 53.66 seconds (set by team member Libby Lenton) with a time of 53.52 seconds in the semifinals. She then went on to win the gold medal for the event, the first Australian to do so since Dawn Fraser 40 years earlier. In her final race at Athens she swam the last leg (freestyle) of the 4×100-metre medley relay, again helping the Australian team win gold in world record time, leaving her with three gold medals and three world records.

* women&#x27;s 4×100-metre freestyle relay
** 1st- Australia (Alice Mills, Libby Lenton, Petria Thomas, Jodie Henry) 3:35.94 - world record
* women&#x27;s 100-metre freestyle
** Semi-final 2: 1st - 53.52 - world record
** Final: 1st - 53.84
* women&#x27;s 4×100-metre medley relay
** 1st - Australia (Giaan Rooney, Leisel Jones, Petria Thomas, Jodie Henry) 3:57.32 - world record

Henry was awarded the Order of Australia Medal that year.

On 29 November 2004, Henry was named the Australian Swimmer of the Year, becoming just the third woman in 15 years to take the honour, joining Susie O&#x27;Neill and Hayley Lewis. Henry also snapped Ian Thorpe&#x27;s five-year streak of receiving the award. She narrowly defeated teammate Petria Thomas to take the honour. Henry was also named Female Sprint Freestyler and her win with Thomas, Giaan Rooney, and Leisel Jones in the 4×100-metre medley relay in Athens was named the Golden Moment of the Year.

===2005 onwards===
Henry won the 100-metre freestyle gold medal at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, clocking 54.18 seconds. That win came on top of her leadoff role in Australia&#x27;s victorious 4×100-metre freestyle team and second relay gold as a heat swimmer in the 4×100-metre medley.

Lenton broke Henry&#x27;s world record at the Commonwealth Games selection trials, setting a new mark of 53.42 seconds. Henry finished with the silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, finishing behind compatriot Lenton (24.61) in the 50-metre and (53.54) 100-metre freestyle, clocking 53.78 seconds and a personal best in the 50-metre with 24.72 seconds for another silver behind Lenton. Henry swam in the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, helping Australia to the gold medal.

On 25 March, at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Henry claimed gold again. Combining with Shayne Reese, rookie Melanie Schlanger and Libby Lenton, Henry anchored the Australian 4×100-metre freestyle relay team in a world championship record time of 3:35.48 seconds, ahead of the United States in 3:35.68 and the Netherlands in 3:36.81. She also won another gold medal in the 4×100-metre medley relay.

In November 2007, Henry returned to her hometown of Brisbane to regain form under new coach Drew McGregor and training at Chandler Swim Club.

She was unable to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics because of a pelvic complaint.

On 30 September 2009, she announced her retirement from swimming.

==Personal life==
She married Tim Notting, and they have three children.

<doc id="901562" wikidata="Q58773" url="?curid=901562" title="Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick">
<text>Charles William Ferdinand (; 9 October 1735 – 10 November 1806) was the ruling prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, hereditary duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and a military leader. His titles are usually shortened to Duke of Brunswick in English-language sources.

He succeeded his father as sovereign prince of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, one of the princely states of the Holy Roman Empire. The duke was a cultured and benevolent despot in the model of his uncle, Frederick the Great, and was married to Princess Augusta, the eldest sister of George III of Great Britain. He was also a recognized master of 18th century warfare, serving as a field marshal in the Prussian Army. During the Napoleonic Wars, he was mortally wounded by a musket ball at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806.

== Early life ==

Charles William Ferdinand was born in the town of Wolfenbüttel on 9 October 1735, probably in Wolfenbüttel Castle. He was the first-born son of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his wife Philippine Charlotte.

His father Charles I was the ruling prince () of the small state of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, one of the imperial states of the Holy Roman Empire. Philippine Charlotte was the favourite daughter of King Frederick William I of Prussia and sister of Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great). As the heir apparent of a sovereign prince, Charles William Ferdinand received the title of Hereditary Prince ().

He received an unusually wide and thorough education, overseen by his mother. In his youth he travelled in the Netherlands, France and various parts of Germany. In 1753, his father moved the capital of the principality back to Brunswick (), the state&#x27;s largest city. (Wolfenbüttel had been the capital since 1432.) The royal family moved into the newly built Brunswick Palace.

== Early military career ==

Charles William Ferdinand entered the military, serving during the Seven Years&#x27; War of 1756–63. He joined the allied north-German forces of the Hanoverian Army of Observation, whose task was to protect Hanover (in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain) and the surrounding states from invasion by the French. The force was initially commanded by the Anglo-Hanoverian Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. At the Battle of Hastenbeck (1757) Charles William Ferdinand led a charge at the head of an infantry brigade, an action which gained him some renown.

The subsequent French Invasion of Hanover and the Convention of Klosterzeven of 1757 temporarily knocked Hanover out of the war (they were to return the following year). Cumberland was recalled to Britain and the remaining allied north-German forces were placed under the command of Ferdinand of Brunswick, brother of Charles I, who easily persuaded his nephew Charles William Ferdinand to renew his military service as a general officer.

Charles William Ferdinand was part of the allied Anglo-German force at the Battle of Minden (1759), and the Battle of Warburg (1760). Both were decisive victories over the French, during which he proved himself an excellent subordinate commander. He continued to serve in the army commanded by his uncle for the remainder of the war, which was generally successful for the north German forces. The hereditary prince&#x27;s reputation improved throughout, and he became an acknowledged master of irregular warfare. Peace was restored in 1763.

==Marriage and travels==
The royal houses of the former Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg had traditionally married within the family, to avoid further division of their family lands under Salic law. By the time, Brunswick-Lüneburg had consolidated back into two states, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover). The electorate was ruled by the Hanoverian branch of the family in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain. It was therefore arranged for Charles William Ferdinand to marry a British-Hanoverian princess: Princess Augusta of Great Britain, daughter of Frederick, Prince of Wales and his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and sister of the reigning King George III.

In 1764, shortly after the Seven Years&#x27; War had ended, he travelled to London (landing at Harwich) to marry Princess Augusta. He received a rapturous welcome from the British people, thanks to his service with allied British troops during the war. The Parliament of Great Britain showed its gratitude by voting him a lump sum of £80,000 and an annual income of £3,000 as a wedding gift. However George III was less welcoming, and sought to express his displeasure through numerous small insults e.g. by lodging the prince at Somerset House, instead of one of the royal palaces; not providing him with a military guard; and instructing the servants at the wedding to wear old clothes. This merely served to exacerbate the enthusiasm of the public, particularly when the prince was suspected of turning his back on the unpopular monarch while attending an opera (a breach of social protocol). Charles William Ferdinand defied royal displeasure by meeting William Pitt the Elder (who had been prime minister during the war but resigned in 1761) and the other leaders of the parliamentary opposition. The wedding was completed, but as a result of these machinations, the prince remained in Britain for only thirteen days.
Over the next few years the couple embarked on a wide-ranging tour of Europe, visiting many of the major states. In 1766 they went to France, where they were received by both his allies and recent battlefield enemies with respect. In Paris he made the acquaintance of Marmontel. The couple next proceeded to Switzerland, where they met Voltaire. The longest stop on their travels was Rome, where they remained for a long time exploring the antiquities of the city under the guidance of Johann Winckelmann. During their travels the couple also met Pietro Nardini and in 1767 the prince had his portrait painted by Pompeo Batoni. After a visit to Naples they returned to Paris, and thence to Brunswick.

== Ruler of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel ==
=== Restoration of state finances ===
His father, Charles I, had been an enthusiastic supporter of the war, but nearly bankrupted the state in paying for it. As a result, in 1773 Charles William Ferdinand was given a major role in reforming the economy with the assistance of the Geheimrat, Féronce von Rotenkreuz. They were highly successful, restoring the state&#x27;s finances and improving the economy. This made the prince hugely popular in the duchy.

When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, Charles William Ferdinand saw an opportunity to replenish the state&#x27;s treasury by renting its well-trained army to Great Britain. In 1776, Charles I signed a treaty supporting Britain in the war, the first prince to do so. Under the terms of this treaty, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel supplied 4,000 troops for service with the British armies in America, under the command of general Friedrich Adolf Riedesel. Riedesel was given command of all the German troops serving in the Saratoga campaign, under British general John Burgoyne. Burgoyne was defeated in the Battles of Saratoga (1777), and his troops were taken captive as the Convention Army. Although the terms of surrender allowed the Convention Army to give their parole and return to Europe, the American Continental Congress revoked the convention. The Convention Army was kept in captivity until the war ended in 1783.

=== Reign ===
Charles I died in 1780, at which point Charles William Ferdinand inherited the throne. He soon became known as a model sovereign, a typical enlightened despot of the period, characterized by economy and prudence.

The duke&#x27;s combination of interest in the well-being of his subjects and habitual caution led to a policy of gradual reforms, a successful middle way between the conservatism of some contemporary monarchs and the over-enthusiastic wholesale changes pursued by others. He sponsored enlightenment arts and sciences; most notably he was patron to the young mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, paying for him to attend university against the wishes of Gauss&#x27;s father.

He resembled his uncle Frederick the Great in many ways, but he lacked the resolution of the king, and in civil as in military affairs was prone to excessive caution. He brought Brunswick into close alliance with the king of Prussia, for whom he had fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War; he was a Prussian field marshal, and was at pains to make the regiment of which he was colonel a model one.

The duke was frequently engaged in diplomatic and other state affairs. In August 1784 he hosted a secret diplomatic visit from Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach (Goethe was a member of Karl August&#x27;s entourage). The visit was disguised as a family visit, but was in fact to discuss the formation of a league of small- and mid-sized German states as a counterbalance within the Holy Roman Empire to Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s ambitions to trade the Austrian Netherlands for the Electorate of Bavaria. This Fürstenbund (League of Princes) was formally announced in 1785, with the Duke of Brunswick as one of its members and commander of its military forces. The league was successful in forcing the Austrian Joseph II to back down, and thereafter became obsolete.

The Swedish princess and diarist Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte visited Brunswick in 1799; she described the Duke as &quot;witty, literal and a pleasant acquaintance but ceremonial beyond description. He is said to be quite strict, but a good father of the nation who attends to the needs of his people.&quot;

In 1803 the process of German Mediatisation led to the acquisition of the neighbouring imperial abbeys of Gandersheim and Helmstedt, which were secularised.

== Military commander ==

He was made a Prussian general in 1773.

=== War of the Bavarian Succession ===

From 1778 to 1779 he served in the War of the Bavarian Succession. Frederick II praised the prince personally for his conduct during the war.

=== Invasion of the Netherlands ===
In 1787 the Duke was made Generalfeldmarschall (field marshal) in the Prussian army. Frederick William II of Prussia appointed him as commander of a 20,000-strong Prussian force which was to invade the United Provinces of the Netherlands (The Dutch Republic). The goal was to suppress the Patriots of the Batavian Revolution, restoring the authority of the stadtholder William V of the House of Orange. Much of the country was in open revolt against William, whose personal troops were unable to quell the Patriot militias and the various Dutch provinces refused to aid him.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; described the Duke&#x27;s invasion: &quot;His success was rapid, complete and almost bloodless, and in the eyes of contemporaries the campaign appeared as an example of perfect generalship&quot;. The Patriots were out-manoeuvred and overwhelmed: their militias were unable to put up any real resistance, were forced to abandon their insurrection, and many Patriots fled to France.

The Duke&#x27;s forces entered the Netherlands on 13 September and occupied Nijmegen that day. The largest Patriot force, 7,000 men under the Rhinegrave of Salm, was quickly out-manoeuvred and forced to abandon Utrecht, which the Duke occupied on 16 September. The Prussian force captured Gorcum on the 17th after a short artillery bombardment, followed by Dordrecht on the 18th and Delft on the 19th. They entered The Hague on the 20th, from which the Patriots had been forced to withdraw following a loyalist insurrection on the 17th. Amsterdam, the last city occupied by the Patriots, surrendered on 10 October. The campaign had taken less than a month. William V was restored to power, which he was to hold until 1795.

Both contemporaries and historians have praised the Duke&#x27;s decisive campaign, in which he manoeuvred to concentrate his forces and achieve overwhelming local superiority, before moving on to the next city. He also received credit for the low number of casualties; one British observer suggested that &quot;the sap of the trees was the only blood shed&quot; (an exaggeration), referring to the wooden palisades and batteries constructed by both sides.

=== War of the First Coalition ===
At the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition in the early summer of 1792, Ferdinand was poised with military forces at Coblenz. After the Girondins had arranged for France to declare war on Austria, voted on 20 April 1792, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II and the Protestant King of Prussia Frederick William II had combined armies and put them under Brunswick&#x27;s command.

==== The Brunswick Proclamation ====
The &quot;Brunswick Proclamation&quot; or &quot;Brunswick Manifesto&quot; that he now issued from Coblenz on 25 July 1792, threatened war and ruin to soldiers and civilians alike, should the Republicans injure Louis XVI and his family. His avowed aim was:
to put an end to the anarchy in the interior of France, to check the attacks upon the throne and the altar, to reestablish the legal power, to restore to the king the security and the liberty of which he is now deprived and to place him in a position to exercise once more the legitimate authority which belongs to him.
Additionally, the manifesto threatened the French population with instant punishment should they resist the Imperial and Prussian armies, or the reinstatement of the monarchy. In large part, the manifesto had been written by Louis XVI&#x27;s cousin, Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, who was the leader of a large corps of émigrés in the allied army.

It has been asserted that the manifesto was in fact issued against the advice of Brunswick himself; the duke, a model sovereign in his own principality, sympathized with the constitutional side of the French Revolution, while as a soldier he had no confidence in the success of the enterprise. However, having let the manifesto bear his signature, he had to bear the full responsibility for its consequences. The proclamation was intended to threaten the French population into submission; it had exactly the opposite effect.

In Paris, Louis XVI was generally believed to be in correspondence with the Austrians and Prussians already, and the republicans became more vocal in the early summer of 1792. Rather than assuring the continued existence of the French monarchy, Brunswick&#x27;s proclamation would instead ensure its downfall; the manifesto was rapidly distributed in Paris on 28 July, apparently by monarchists, who badly misjudged the effect it would have. The Brunswick Manifesto seemed to furnish the agitators with a complete justification for the revolt that they were already planning. When news spread of a combined Austrian and Prussian army led by Brunswick marching into French soil on the days after the Manifesto was publicized, the Paris populace, already incensed by the threat against the city, exploded into violence. The first violent action was carried out on 10 August, when the Tuileries Palace was stormed.

==== Invasion of France ====
The Duke was disappointed that the British remained neutral. His initial advance into France was slowed by poor weather, the rough terrain of the Forest of Argonne, and an outbreak of dysentery among his troops.

The Duke was less successful against the French citizens&#x27; army that met him at Valmy. Having secured Longwy and Verdun without serious resistance, he turned back after a mere skirmish in Valmy, and evacuated France.

Initially the Duke intended to winter in the fortress of Verdun, before resuming the campaign in France the following spring. However, Kellerman&#x27;s forces outflanked him by advancing up the Rhine, recapturing French possessions there. The Duke abandoned Verdun on 8 October and Longwy on 22 October, before retreating back into Germany.

When he counterattacked the Revolutionary French who had invaded Germany, in 1793, he recaptured Mainz after a long siege, but resigned in 1794 in protest at interference by Frederick William II of Prussia.

=== War of the Fourth Coalition ===

Prussia did not take part in the Second Coalition or the Third Coalition against Revolutionary France. However, in 1806 Prussia declared war on France, beginning the War of the Fourth Coalition. Despite being over 70 years old, the Duke of Brunswick returned to command the Prussian army at the personal request of Louise, Queen of Prussia.

By this stage the Prussian army was regarded as backward, using outdated tactics and with poor communication. The structure of the high command has been particularly criticised by historians, with multiple officers developing differing plans and then disagreeing on which should be followed, leading to disorganisation and indecision.

The duke commanded the large Prussian army at Auerstedt during the double Battle of Jena–Auerstedt on 14 October 1806. His forces were defeated by Napoleon&#x27;s marshal Davout, despite the Prussians outnumbering the French around Auerstedt by two to one. During the battle he was struck by a musket ball and lost both of his eyes; his second-in-command Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau was also mortally wounded, causing a breakdown in the Prussian command. Severely wounded, the Duke was carried with his forces before the advancing French. He died of his wounds in Ottensen on 10 November 1806.
The duke&#x27;s body was provisionally laid to rest in the Christianskirche at Ottensen in 1806. It was later transferred for reburial in Brunswick Cathedral on 6 November 1819.

==Family==
On 16 January 1764, Charles married Princess Augusta of Great Britain, eldest sister of King George III. The couple were second cousins to each other, being great-grandchildren of George I of Great Britain. As such, they were not related in a particularly close degree, yet there had been many bonds of marriage between the House of Brunswick-Bevern and the House of Hanover, themselves both branches of the House of Welf.

Some commentators have pointed to inbreeding as a possible cause for the fact that many of the couple&#x27;s children had physical, mental or psychological disabilities. Indeed, the duke was once moved to describe his children to von Massenbach as &quot;mostly cripples in mind and body.&quot;

Shortly after they married, the prince had the Schloss Richmond built for his wife. It was in English architectural style and with an English landscape garden, to remind her of her home.

The duke and his wife Augusta had four sons and three daughters. Three of their four sons had major debilities. Their eldest son, Karl Georg August (1766–1806) was named heir apparent, but had a significant learning disability and was regarded as &quot;well-nigh imbecile.&quot;

Nevertheless, he was married in 1790 to Frederika of Orange-Nassau, daughter of William V, Prince of Orange, a gentle, good-hearted woman who remained devoted to him to the end. He died childless at the age of 40 in 1806, shortly before his father. The second son, Georg Wilhelm Christian (1769–1811), had an even more severe learning disability than his elder brother. He was declared incapacitated and excluded from the succession. He never married. The couple&#x27;s third son was August (1770–1822). He was blind and also excluded from the succession. He, too, never married. The fourth son, Friedrich Wilhelm (1771 – 16 June 1815), was sound of mind and body. He eventually succeeded his father, married and sired two sons.

Frederick and Augusta also had three daughters, two of whom reached adulthood. Neither of them was disabled, but both of them had similar, disastrous trajectories in life. Both of them were married to future kings, both made extreme failures of their marriages, both had extremely acrimonious relations with their husbands, and both were accused by them of similar faults: adultery, uncouth behavior, absence of dignity, falsehood and utter fecklessness. The elder daughter, Auguste Caroline Friederike (1764–1788), was the wife of the future king Frederick I of Württemberg and mother of the future William I of Württemberg. She separated from her husband and died in Russia from complications that arose while giving birth in secret to an illegitimate child.

The younger daughter, Caroline of Brunswick, was married in 1795 to her first cousin, the future George IV of the United Kingdom, and bore him a daughter, the ill-fated Princess Charlotte of Wales. On two occasions (1806 and 1818–19), her husband made serious efforts to divorce her on grounds of adultery, forming commissions of inquiry to indict her, and after he became king, he in fact caused the House of Lords to pass a bill of divorce citing adultery with an Italian commoner. 

However, the bill was never introduced in the House of Commons and the divorce was never finalized. Caroline died three weeks after she was physically prevented from entering Westminster Abbey to participate in her husband&#x27;s coronation.

The future Queen of Sweden, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described the ducal family thus:
The Duchess is the sister to the King of England and a typical Englishwoman. She looked very simple, like a vicar&#x27;s wife, has I am sure many admirable qualities, and is very respectable, but completely lacks manners. She makes the strangest questions without considering how difficult and unpleasant they can be. ... The sons of the Ducal couple are somewhat peculiar. The (eldest) prince, chubby and fat, almost blind, strange and odd - if not to say an imbecile - attempts to imitate his father but only makes himself artificial and unpleasant. He talks continually, does not know what he says, and is in all aspects unbearable. He is accommodating but a poor thing, loves his consort to the point of worship, and is completely governed by her. The (second) son, Prince Georg, is the most ridiculous person imaginable, and so silly that he can never be left alone but is always accompanied by a courtier. The third son is also described as an original. I never saw him, as he served with his regiment. The fourth is the only normal one, but also torments his parents by his immoral behaviour.

The duke also fathered at least one illegitimate child, a son named Forstenburg, who began a promising military career but was killed in action in 1793.

<doc id="901563" wikidata="Q1302821" url="?curid=901563" title="High School High">
<text>High School High is a 1996 American comedy film about an inner city high school in the Los Angeles, California area, starring Jon Lovitz, Tia Carrere, Mekhi Phifer, Louise Fletcher, Malinda Williams, and Brian Hooks. It is a spoof of films concerning idealistic teachers (such as &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;) being confronted with a class of cynical teenagers, disengaged by conventional schooling, and loosely parodies &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, &quot;High School Confidential&quot;, &quot;The Principal&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, &quot;Lean on Me&quot;, &quot;The Substitute&quot;, &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, and &quot;Grease&quot;.

The film is dedicated to the memories of casting director Elisabeth Leustig and actor Lexie Bigham, both of whom were killed in automobile crashes shortly after filming was completed.

==Plot==
Richard Clark is an unsatisfied prep school teacher at the fictional Wellington Academy, who accepts a job at inner city Marion Barry High School, much to the chagrin of his boss and father, Wellington headmaster Thaddeus Clark. Richard arrives to find the school in a state of disarray and disorder, while meeting several students and faculty members including: the blunted, soured, and uninspiring principal, Evelyn Doyle, her cheerful assistant Victoria Chappell and student Griff McReynolds.

Despite initial opposition to his teaching style and harassment from the school gang leader Paco, Richard begins connecting with his students and teaches them effectively, while developing a romantic relationship with Victoria. Barry High eventually is transformed into a fine educational establishment. Frustrated, Paco and his gang tamper with the school&#x27;s final exam scores, causing everyone to fail. Griff, who grew to see Richard as a mentor, loses faith in him, as does the rest of the school and Richard is fired. Griff subsequently joins Paco&#x27;s gang to make extra money.

Victoria learns through word of mouth that Paco was behind the failing test scores and rushes to inform Richard, who decides to confront Paco and rescue Griff with the help of several of his students, including Anferny Jefferson, Natalie Thompson and Julie Rubels. By deceiving Mr. DeMarco, a local gangster, Richard and Victoria reach Paco and the local crime boss, &quot;Mr. A&quot;, whom they find has been Principal Doyle the entire time. Griff is told the truth about the test scores and after a brief fight, Paco, Doyle and DeMarco are arrested.

Richard (now principal of Barry High) presides over the graduation ceremony and proudly names Griff as the class valedictorian. The six main students of the film graduate (but only those six). Richard makes good on his promise to send Griff to college and is in a relationship with Victoria.

==Cast==

* Tia Carrere as Victoria Chappell, the principal&#x27;s assistant who sympathizes with Richard, as well as with the troubled students at Marion Barry High.

==Release==
The film opened at #2 on the weekend of October 25, 1996, behind the film &quot;Sleepers&quot;. The film remained in the top 5 for the next two weekends.

===Reception===
The film received generally negative reviews upon its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a score of 19% based on reviews from 16 critics, with an average rating of 4.4/10. On Metacritic, it has a score of 33 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film 1 stars out of 4, and said &quot;the movie makes two mistakes: (1) It isn&#x27;t very funny, and (2) it makes the crucial error of taking its story seriously and angling for a happy ending.&quot;

Andrew Hindes wrote in &quot;Variety&quot; that &quot;the problem with &quot;High School High&quot; isn’t that it always goes for the cheap laugh, but that it fails at getting it so often. Like a student who studies hard but just doesn’t have the smarts, this joyless send-up of the &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, idealistic-teacher-in-a-ghetto-school genre plods along earnestly with barely passing grades. B.O. prospects appear below average: Given the lack of youth-oriented fare in the marketplace, target teen audiences may fill seats early in the semester, but attendance is likely to drop off quickly.&quot;

Upon its video release in March 1997, Michael Sauter wrote in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that &quot;uplifting inner-city high school movies on the order of &quot;Dangerous Mind&quot;s get an overdue but underinspired send-up in this occasionally funny spoof cowritten by David Zucker (&quot;The Naked Gun&quot;)&quot;, adding that &quot;despite a steady stream of such typical Zucker sight gags, this parody’s pace is surprisingly slack. Even the TV tube’s reduced, sitcom-friendly confines aren’t enough to hide the holes of &quot;High School High&quot;.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on August 19, 1996, via Big Beat Records. The album peaked at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at No. 4 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 500,000 copies in the United States.

<doc id="901576" wikidata="Q6272507" url="?curid=901576" title="Jonathan Baldwin Turner">
<text>Jonathan Baldwin Turner (December 7, 1805 – January 10, 1899) was an American classical scholar, agriculturalist, and abolitionist. He also led a political movement to create agriculture colleges, and campaigned to institute land grant universities. He established the use of the thorny &quot;hedge apple&quot; planted to form a barrier in North America. In 1835, Turner married Rhodolphia Kibbe and they had seven children.

Turner was the author of &quot;A Plan for an Industrial University&quot; for the state of Illinois&#x27;s Farmer&#x27;s Convention at Granville in 1851. He had laid out a plan for a national grant to provide an industrial and mechanical college for each US state. A similar plan was later introduced in the Senate by Senator Justin Morrill and became law as the Morrill Land-Grant Act in 1862, establishing many of the United States&#x27; public colleges and universities.

== Early life ==

Jonathan Baldwin Turner was born December 7, 1805, outside Templeton, Massachusetts; his parents were farmers Asa Turner and Nabby Baldwin. Jonathan was educated in local schools before attending and graduating from then-Yale College, where he studied classical literature at Yale, and excelled in Greek and English composition. Turner was ordained as a minister and graduated in 1833, after which he moved to Illinois to become a professor at the newly organized Illinois College at Jacksonville. He taught subjects across the whole curriculum but specialized in , Latin, and Greek. Students of Turner, the Green brothers, brought him in contact with Abraham Lincoln, who was helping with the harvest on the Green Family farm. Lincoln had heard of Turner&#x27;s teaching and became interested in it.

==Educational activism==
Jonathan Baldwin Turner&#x27;s views in favor of the abolition of slavery were a subject of growing controversy. In 1848, he resigned from his teaching post as chair of , Greek, and literature at Illinois College. He created the Illinois Industrial League to advocate for a publicly funded system to provide &quot;industrial&quot; education that suited the needs of the working (&quot;industrial&quot;) classes.

Turner continued to advocate for his model of education. A similar plan Justin Morrill introduced became law as the Morrill Land-Grant Act in 1862. Turner was displeased with the political process that located the Illinois Industrial University in Urbana, Illinois. Turner spoke at university&#x27;s cornerstone-laying event, saying: &quot;Industrial education prepares the way for a millennium of labor&quot;, words that were carved in stone and placed above the university&#x27;s main square.

==Agricultural research==
Jonathan Baldwin Turner was an agriculturist; he improved agriculture and established the use of the &quot;hedge apple&quot; or thorny Osage orange tree (&quot;Maclura pomifera&quot;), a variety of which he developed. At this time, there were very few trees on the prairies to set up split rail fences. While working as a professor at Illinois College, Turner began searching for a plant to use as a hedge to divide, cultivate the expanse of the prairie, and contain livestock. He was inspired by hedgerows in England, and procured seeds from Texas with which to experiment on his farm in Butler, Illinois.

In the late 1830s, Turner selected the Osage orange tree as an ideal plant for this purpose, and patented a machine for preparing the soil and planting the tree&#x27;s seeds. Turner then advertised and sold Osage orange seeds, which were widely used as hedges before the development of barbed wire between 1867 and 1874. After barbed wire was introduced, farmers still used their Osage orange trees as fence posts, connecting the barbed wire directly to the tree trunks. The wood from this tree is strong, decay resistant, and long-lasting.

==Abolitionist activism and the Underground Railroad==
Jonathan Baldwin Turner became the editor of a Jacksonville abolitionist newspaper, probably during the 1840s; he also became an assistant with the Underground Railroad and a vocal opponent of slavery. Turner and his wife hid three black slaves for two weeks. His life was frequently threatened due to his abolitionist beliefs. Turner believed the only way to fight slavery was with writing, speech, and the law.

==Later years==
After the passing of the Morrill Land-Grant Act, Jonathan Baldwin Turner opposed the power of corporations, which he described as a conflict between the &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;artificial man&quot;. In addition, Turner was a trustee for the mentally ill in Illinois&#x27; hospitals.

As an ordained minister, Turner was affiliated early on with two Congregational churches but his beliefs became increasingly unorthodox. He wrote religious tracts championing the liberal teachings of Christ while criticizing Catholicism, Mormonism, and the Presbyterian administration of Illinois College, where he was a professor. Turner believed Christ&#x27;s Creed is broad enough to save all of humanity; he wrote three books on Christ and about his views on Mormonism.

==Death and legacy==
Jonathan Baldwin Turner died on January 10, 1899, in Jacksonville, Illinois, at the age of 93. Tributes and memorials were made in his memory. A statue of Turner was erected at the University of Illinois, and Jonathan Turner Junior High School in Jacksonville was named for him. In 1923, a centuries-old boulder with a bronze plaque was placed in Granville, Illinois, honoring the Granville Convention and Turner. The bronze tablet commemorates the introduction by Turner of the first institutions for scientific industrial higher learning at the Granville convention in 1851.

The Jonathan Baldwin Turner Scholarship at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign provides $8,000 to a student over three years of college. The College of Aces (Jonathan Baldwin Turner Fellowships) are for doctorate candidates. Turner&#x27;s papers are held by the Illinois History and Lincoln Collections of the University of Illinois Library at Urbana-Champaign.

<text>The Menelaus blue morpho (Morpho menelaus) is one of thirty species of butterfly in the subfamily Morphinae. Its wingspan is approximately (4.7&quot;), and its dorsal forewings and hindwings are a bright, iridescent blue edged with black, while the ventral surfaces are brown. Its iridescent wings are an area of interest in research because of their unique microstructure. Due to its characteristic blue color, &quot;Morpho menelaus&quot; is considered valuable among collectors and was widely hunted in the 20th century.

==Range==
This neotropical butterfly is found in Central and South America, including the Cerrado which is a vast tropical savanna in Brazil. Other locations include Mexico and Venezuela. Ancestors of the &quot;Morpho&quot; &quot;menelaus&quot; butterfly may have been distributed in the Andean regions.
Morpho menelaus is one of the six species of Morpho in Costa Rica. The genus of Morpho is present in regions beginning in Mexico and throughout South America, except Chile. Moreover, the Morpho menelaus struggle to survive in the northern Pacific area of Costa Rica since they can’t tolerate such dry conditions. They also need habitats in old growth forests with proper differentiation between the understories and canopies (Murillo-Hiller &amp; Canet, 2018). 

== Phylogeny ==
There is great variation among the various species of &quot;Morpho&quot;. Two groups of &quot;Morpho&quot; butterflies, &quot; achilles&quot; and &quot; hecuba&quot;, are distinct in flight behavior and vertical forest distribution. This habitat stratification between the two forest levels may have led to the diversification of the &quot;Morpho&quot; butterflies. Flight pattern behavior may also have led to changes in the wing shape to make it more suitable for gliding or flapping. Phylogenetic studies suggest these are indicative of ancestral qualities.

&quot;Morpho menelaus&quot; is part of the &quot;achilles&quot; subclade of &quot;Morpho.&quot; Within this species, there are no differences between males and females regarding forewing length, aspect ratio and wing centroid measurement which may be indicative of morphological homogeneity. Despite the popularity of the genus &quot;Morpho&quot;, there is not a general consensus on the number of species or on how these species are defined. For instance, some consider &quot;M. amanthonte&quot; a subspecies of &quot;Morpho melanus&quot;, but this is not supported by morphology. Some older studies have identified 75 &quot;Morpho&quot; species, and newer studies recognize about 30 species. Despite the many species of the &quot;Morpho&quot; butterfly displayed in collections, they usually have mismatched or missing abdomens which make it difficult for research. Using combined studies of parsimony and Bayesian analyses, &quot;Morpho melanus&quot; is associated with the &quot;M. helenor&quot;, &quot;M. sulkowskyi&quot; and &quot;M. amonthonte&quot; clades. The split of &quot;Morpho melanus&quot; from &quot;M. amonthonte&quot; is estimated to fall under the Pliocene era.

== Behavior ==
Females inhabit the forest understory and perch on tree stumps, but are found near the tree tops when it is time to lay eggs. Both sexes have a slow and floppy flight pattern and feed on rotting fruit that has dropped to the ground. Males tend to fly in open clearings or high in the canopy. These butterflies collectively emerge in the beginning and the end of the wet season in Cerrado. They do not appear in the middle of the wet season because the heavy rain can cause physical harm to their wings. Their emergence depends on the availability of food which is dependent on climate. For protection from the rain, &quot;Morpho menelaus&quot; prefers small and enclosed spaces.

== Life cycle ==
=== Egg ===
The egg of the Morpho menelaus butterfly is typically small, round, and somewhat flattened. They are usually pale green or whitish in color, sometimes with a slightly metallic sheen, but not as vibrant as the adult butterfly&#x27;s iridescent blue wings, and shaped like dew drops. The female laid around 12 eggs in cluster of 5 or 6 eggs on the undersides of the leaves. The eggs are laid so that the caterpillars may feed as soon as they hatch.

=== Caterpillars ===
These social caterpillars feed on &quot;Erythroxylum&quot;, &quot;Dalbergia&quot;, and Fabaceae, and may prefer to feed on new leaves of host plants since these new leaves are easier and more nutritious to eat. The caterpillars are red-brown in color with bright green spots. They are covered with bristles that release an irritant upon contact. Conversely, the peak of the caterpillar is in the dry season, a climate that is unsuitable for most animal communities. These caterpillars will enter diapause or suspend development and can delay pupation in order to survive this harsh period and the lack of water. As the dry season continues, the caterpillar population declines due to predation.

=== Adults ===
One of the best seasonal predictors of adult butterfly occurrence is the ripening of fruit. Adult emergence occurs primarily in the beginning of the wet season, when the climate and air humidity makes food resources plentiful and oviposition advantageous. The butterfly spends 3 to 4 weeks as an adult, and the entire life cycle is about 115 days. Adults fly along rivers, or anywhere that open land has been revealed.

== Adaptations ==
Eyespots on wings are visual anti-predatory adaptations that have evolved in many species within Lepidoptera. The eyespots are usually dark circles surrounded by a brighter outer layer. The &#x27;pupil&#x27; of the eye has a sparkle that mimics the natural reflection of the cornea. These eyes are thought to deflect a predator&#x27;s attack away from more vital organs and toward that spot on the wings. Bigger eyespots have also been shown to deter predators from attacking completely. &quot; Menelaus&quot; specifically has an eyespot that is in diameter on its ventral wings that it uses to help avoid predation.

== Wing structure ==
The wings of &quot;Morpho menelaus&quot; are a prime example of iridescent blue coloration in the insect world. The bright and iridescent colors of other butterflies are typically caused by optical interference, but the iridescent blue color of butterflies in the family Morphidae results from the microstructures of the wings. Scientists use SEM, scanning electronic microscope, and spectroscopy, to understand the wings in greater detail.

=== Structural components ===
Each wing is covered in multi-layered scales, which are responsible for the coloration of the wings. The wing colors vary with viewing angle, a phenomenon referred to as structural color. In the female, the dorsal side is more camouflaged while the male presents with a vibrant blue. In the male, the outer layer of the cover scales are long and narrow (), apart, and parallel to the wing plane. The dimensions of the cover scales in other species of the subfamily Morphinae vary greatly, but all are pigment-less and lowly iridescent. The inner layer, called ground scales, are pigmented, iridescent, do not overlap, and are responsible for the blue coloration. They consist of alternating layers of chitin and air, each having its own refractive indexes. The wings of the genus &quot;Morpho&quot; are noteworthy for their diversity of function, including being hydrophobic, lightweight, sturdy, thermally regulated, and bright blue iridescent. These unique characteristics originate from the photonic nanostructures in the ridges of the scales. There has been increasing interest in the bioengineering community into understanding the structural components of the wing which can have potential applications in creating structural-color devices and selective gas-sensors. 

=== Iridescence ===
Iridescence is the phenomenon when light interacts with a particular surface, and at differing angles of illumination and observation the color begins to gradually change. The &quot;Morpho Menelaus&quot;&#x27; characteristic iridescent wings has a unique wing structure. The ground scales are covered by a set of longitudinal ridges, and within the ridges are layers of lamella. Because the size of the microstructure is the same as the wavelength of light, the layers in the wings react strongly with visible light. The ground and cover scales have an observable &quot;Christmas-tree&quot; structure which is responsible for the diffraction or bending of light pattern of the wings which results in the characteristic iridescence blue color.

Within the ground scales are layers of lamella. The upper lamina is closely marked with longitudinal ridges. The ridges themselves consist of individual lamellae (6–12) which overlap like shingles on a roof. The inter-spacings of the lamella layers is around , but there are variations in the thickness of each lamella. A network of netted trabeculae separates neighboring lamellae.

=== Hydrophobic surface ===
A superhydrophobic surface is when water is dropped, a spherical ball forms and rolls off the surface. Any dirt or dust that is on the surface will be removed along with the water drop forming. The wings of &quot;Morpho menelaus&quot; have attracted potential research interest because of its self-cleaning property. The microstructure of the wing plays an important role in this unique feature.

== Collections ==
&quot;Morpho menelaus&quot; is unique because of its iridescent blue color and large wingspan. They are one of the most familiar and recognizable neotropical insects. Over the past century, there has been an accumulation of these butterflies in both private and museum collections, and they are considered highly valuable among collectors, artists, and designers for their beautiful coloration and are widely hunted or bred for decorative purposes. Because of the popularity of collecting and rearing Morpho species for sale, there is a wide discrepancy in its taxonomic understanding among collectors.

<text>Minister Mentor was a position in the Cabinet of Singapore created in 2004 as part of a transition in political leadership. The only person to hold the post, between 2004 and 2011, was Lee Kuan Yew.

==Background==

On 12 August 2004, when Lee Hsien Loong succeeded Goh Chok Tong as the prime minister of Singapore, he announced the position of Minister Mentor, as part of a transition of political leadership, when naming his Cabinet.

Prior to Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s appointment as Minister Mentor, he was Senior Minister between 1990 and 2004 under Goh Chok Tong&#x27;s Cabinet. Goh was subsequently appointed Senior Minister under Lee Hsien Loong&#x27;s Cabinet when he stepped down as prime minister.

On 14 May 2011, following the general election that took place seven days earlier, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong announced their retirement from the Cabinet, but continued to serve as Members of Parliament (MPs) on the backbenches until Lee&#x27;s death in 2015 and Goh&#x27;s retirement from politics in 2020 respectively.

<doc id="901593" wikidata="Q2036661" url="?curid=901593" title="Lambda cube">
<text>In mathematical logic and type theory, the λ-cube (also written lambda cube) is a framework introduced by Henk Barendregt to investigate the different dimensions in which the calculus of constructions is a generalization of the simply typed λ-calculus. Each dimension of the cube corresponds to a new kind of dependency between terms and types. Here, &quot;dependency&quot; refers to the capacity of a term or type to bind a term or type. The respective dimensions of the λ-cube correspond to:

* x-axis (formula_1): types that can bind terms, corresponding to dependent types.
* y-axis (formula_2): terms that can bind types, corresponding to polymorphism.
* z-axis (formula_3): types that can bind types, corresponding to (binding) type operators.

The different ways to combine these three dimensions yield the 8 vertices of the cube, each corresponding to a different kind of typed system. The λ-cube can be generalized into the concept of a pure type system.

== Examples of Systems ==

=== (λ→) Simply typed lambda calculus ===

The simplest system found in the λ-cube is the simply typed lambda calculus, also called λ→. In this system, the only way to construct an abstraction is by making &quot;a term depend on a term&quot;, with the typing rule:

formula_4

=== (λ2) System F ===
In System F (also named λ2 for the &quot;second-order typed lambda calculus&quot;) there is another type of abstraction, written with a formula_5, that allows &quot;terms to depend on types&quot;, with the following rule:

formula_6

The terms beginning with a formula_5 are called polymorphic, as they can be applied to different types to get different functions, similarly to polymorphic functions in ML-like languages. For instance, the polymorphic identity 
fun x -&gt; x
of OCaml has type 
&#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;a
meaning it can take an argument of any type codice_1 and return an element of that type. This type corresponds in λ2 to the type formula_8.

=== (λω) System Fω ===

In System Fformula_9 a construction is introduced to supply &quot;types that depend on other types&quot;. This is called a type constructor and provides a way to build &quot;a function with a type as a &quot;value&quot;&quot;. An example of such a type constructor is the type of binary trees with leaves labeled by data of a given type formula_10: formula_11, where &quot;formula_12&quot; informally means &quot;formula_10 is a type&quot;. This is a function that takes a type parameter formula_10 as an argument and returns the type of formula_15s of values of type formula_10. In concrete programming, this feature corresponds to the ability to define type constructors inside the language, rather than considering them as primitives. The previous type constructor roughly corresponds to the following definition of a tree with labeled leaves in OCaml:
type &#x27;a tree = | Leaf of &#x27;a | Node of &#x27;a tree * &#x27;a tree
This type constructor can be applied to other types to obtain new types. E.g., to obtain type of trees of integers:type int_tree = int tree

System Fformula_9 is generally not used on its own, but is useful to isolate the independent feature of type constructors.

=== (λP) Lambda-P ===
In the λP system, also named λΠ, and closely related to the LF Logical Framework, one has so called dependent types. These are &quot;types that are allowed to depend on terms&quot;. The crucial introduction rule of the system is

formula_18

where formula_19 represents valid types. The new type constructor formula_20 corresponds via the Curry-Howard isomorphism to a universal quantifier, and the system λP as a whole corresponds to first-order logic with implication as only connective. An example of these dependent types in concrete programming is the type of vectors on a certain length: the length is a term, on which the type depends.

=== (λω) System Fω ===
System Fω combines both the formula_5 constructor of System F and the type constructors from System Fformula_9. Thus System Fω provides both &quot;terms that depend on types&quot; and &quot;types that depend on types&quot;.

=== (λC) Calculus of constructions ===
In the calculus of constructions, denoted as λC in the cube or as λPω, these four features cohabit, so that both types and terms can depend on types and terms. The clear border that exists in λ→ between terms and types is somewhat abolished, as all types except the universal formula_23 are themselves terms with a type.

== Formal definition ==

As for all systems based upon the simply typed lambda calculus, all systems in the cube are given in two steps: first, raw terms, together with a notion of β-reduction, and then typing rules that allow to type those terms.

The set of sorts is defined as formula_24, sorts are represented with the letter formula_25. There is also a set formula_26 of variables, represented by the letters formula_27. The raw terms of the eight systems of the cube are given by the following syntax:

formula_28

and formula_29 denoting formula_30 when formula_31 does not occur free in formula_32.

The environments, as is usual in typed systems, are given by
formula_33

The notion of β-reduction is common to all systems in the cube. It is written formula_34 and given by the rulesformula_35formula_36formula_37formula_38formula_39Its reflexive, transitive closure is written formula_40.

The following typing rules are also common to all systems in the cube:formula_41formula_42formula_43formula_44formula_45

The difference between the systems is in the pairs of sorts formula_46 that are allowed in the following two typing rules:formula_47formula_48

The correspondence between the systems and the pairs formula_46 allowed in the rules is the following:
Each direction of the cube corresponds to one pair (excluding the pair formula_50 shared by all systems), and in turn each pair corresponds to one possibility of dependency between terms and types:

* formula_50 allows terms to depend on terms.
* formula_52 allows types to depend on terms.
* formula_53 allows terms to depend on types.
* formula_54 allows types to depend on types.

==Comparison between the systems==

===λ→===

A typical derivation that can be obtained isformula_55or with the arrow shortcutformula_56closely resembling the identity (of type formula_57) of the usual λ→. Note that all types used must appear in the context, because the only derivation that can be done in an empty context is formula_58.

The computing power is quite weak, it corresponds to the extended polynomials (polynomials together with a conditional operator).

===λ2===

In λ2, such terms can be obtained asformula_59with formula_60. If one reads formula_61 as a universal quantification, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism, this can be seen as a proof of the principle of explosion. In general, λ2 adds the possibility to have impredicative types such as formula_62, that is terms quantifying over all types including themselves.The polymorphism also allows the construction of functions that were not constructible in λ→. More precisely, the functions definable in λ2 are those provably total in second-order Peano arithmetic. In particular, all primitive recursive functions are definable.

===λP===

In λP, the ability to have types depending on terms means one can express logical predicates. For instance, the following is derivable:formula_63which corresponds, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism, to a proof of formula_64.From the computational point of view, however, having dependent types does not enhance computational power, only the possibility to express more precise type properties.

The conversion rule is strongly needed when dealing with dependent types, because it allows to perform computation on the terms in the type.
For instance, if one has formula_65 and formula_66, one needs to apply the conversion rule to obtain formula_67 to be able to type formula_68.

===λω===

In λω, the following operatorformula_69is definable, that is formula_70. The derivationformula_71can be obtained already in λ2, however the polymorphic formula_72 can only be defined if the rule formula_53 is also present.

From a computing point of view, λω is extremely strong, and has been considered as a basis for programming languages.

===λC===

The calculus of constructions has both the predicate expressiveness of λP and the computational power of λω, hence why λC is also called λPω, so it is very powerful, both on the logical side and on the computational side.

== Relation to other systems ==
The system Automath is similar to λ2 from a logical point of view. The ML-like languages, from a typing point of view, lie somewhere between λ→ and λ2, as they admit a restricted kind of polymorphic types, that is the types in prenex normal form. However, because they feature some recursion operators, their computing power is greater than that of λ2. The Coq system is based on an extension of λC with a linear hierarchy of universes, rather than only one untypable formula_74, and the ability to construct inductive types.

Pure type systems can be seen as a generalization of the cube, with an arbitrary set of sorts, axiom, product and abstraction rules. Conversely, the systems of the lambda cube can be expressed as pure type systems with two sorts formula_75, the only axiom formula_76, and a set of rules formula_77 such that formula_78.

Via the Curry-Howard isomorphism, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the systems in the lambda cube and logical systems, namely:

All the logics are implicative (i.e. the only connectives are formula_79 and formula_80), however one can define other connectives such as formula_81 or formula_82 in an impredicative way in second and higher order logics. In the weak higher order logics, there are variables for higher order predicates, but no quantification on those can be done.

==Common properties==

All systems in the cube enjoy
* the Church-Rosser property: if formula_83 and formula_84 then there exists formula_85 such that formula_86 and formula_87;
* the subject reduction property: if formula_88 and formula_89 then formula_90;
* the uniqueness of types: if formula_91 and formula_92 then formula_93.

All of these can be proven on generic pure type systems.

Any term well-typed in a system of the cube is strongly normalizing, although this property is not common to all pure type systems. No system in the cube is Turing complete.

== Subtyping ==
Subtyping however is not represented in the cube, even though systems like formula_94, known as higher-order bounded quantification, which combines subtyping and polymorphism are of practical interest, and can be further generalized to bounded type operators. Further extensions to formula_94 allow the definition of purely functional objects; these systems were generally developed after the lambda cube paper was published.

The idea of the cube is due to the mathematician Henk Barendregt (1991). The framework of pure type systems generalizes the lambda cube in the sense that all corners of the cube, as well as many other systems can be represented as instances of this general framework. This framework predates the lambda cube by a couple of years. In his 1991 paper, Barendregt also defines the corners of the cube in this framework.

<doc id="901601" wikidata="Q7317724" url="?curid=901601" title="Revaluation of fixed assets">
<text>In finance, a revaluation of fixed assets is an action that may be required to accurately describe the true value of the capital goods a business owns. This should be distinguished from planned depreciation, where the recorded decline in the value of an asset is tied to its age.

Fixed assets are held by an enterprise for the purpose of producing goods or rendering services, as opposed to being held for resale for the normal course of business. An example, machines, buildings, patents, or licenses can be fixed assets of a business.

The purpose of a revaluation is to bring into the books the fair market value of fixed assets. This may be helpful in order to decide whether to invest in another business. If a company wants to sell one of its assets, it is revalued in preparation for sales negotiations.
==Reasons for revaluation==
It is common to see companies revaluing their fixed assets. It is important to make a distinction between a &#x27;private&#x27; revaluation and a &#x27;public&#x27; revaluation which is carried out in the financial reports. The purposes are varied:
* To show the true rate of return on capital employed.
* To conserve adequate funds in the business for replacement of fixed assets at the end of their useful lives. Provision for depreciation based on historical cost will show inflated profits and lead to payment of excessive dividends.
* To show the fair market value of assets which have considerably appreciated since their purchase such as land and buildings.
* To negotiate fair price for the assets of the company before merger with or acquisition by another company.
* To enable proper internal reconstruction and external reconstruction.
* To issue shares to existing shareholders (rights issue or follow-on offering).
* To get fair market value of assets, in case of sale-and-leaseback transaction.
* When the company intends to take a loan from banks or financial institutions by mortgaging its fixed assets. Proper revaluation of assets would enable the company to get a higher amount of loan.
* Sale of an individual asset or group of assets.
* In financial firms revaluation reserves are required for regulatory reasons. They are included when calculating a firm&#x27;s funds to give a fairer view of resources. Only a portion of the firm&#x27;s total funds (usually about 20%) can be loaned or in the hands of any one counterparty at any one time (large exposures restrictions).
* To decrease the debt-to-equity ratio (&quot;leverage ratio&quot;).

==Methods of revaluation of fixed assets==
The common methods used in revaluing assets are:

===Indexation===
Under this method, indices are applied to the cost value of the assets, to arrive at the current cost of the assets. The Indices by the country&#x27;s departments of Statistical Bureau or Economic Surveys may be used for the revaluation of assets.

===Current Market Price (CMP)===
*Land values can be estimated by using recent prices for similar plots of land sold in the area. However, certain adjustments will have to be made for the plus and minus points of the land possessed by the company. This may be done with the assistance of brokers and agencies dealing in land, or by a licensed appraiser.
*Buildings values can be estimated by a real estate agent (or broker or dealer) or Chartered Surveyor (in the UK) in a similar manner to land.
*Plant and Machinery: The CMP can be obtained from suppliers of the assets concerned. This may not be possible if brands are unavailable in the market due to the closure of companies manufacturing them. Similarly, a direct CMP may not be available for a model that has been discontinued or changed by the manufacturer. Comparison of assets to most similar types available for sale, new or used, can provide an estimate of value.

CMP of an existing asset = CMP of comparable new asset × remaining useful life of asset ÷ original useful life of asset.

===Appraisal method===
Under this method, technical experts are called in to carry out a detailed examination of the assets with a view to determining their fair market value. A proper appraisal is necessary when the company is taking out an insurance policy for the protection of its fixed assets. It ensures that the fixed assets are neither over-insured nor under-insured. The factors which are considered in determining the value of an asset, are as follows:
* Date of purchase.
* Extent of use i.e. single shift, double shift, triple shift.
* Type of asset. Whether the asset is a general purpose or special purpose asset?
* Repairs and Maintenance policy of the enterprise.
* Availability of spares in the future, mainly in the case of imported machines.
* Future demand for the product manufactured by an asset.
* If the asset is part of a bigger fixed asset, the life of the latter is crucial.

===Selective revaluation===
Selective revaluation can be defined as the revaluation of specific assets within a class or all assets within a specific location.

A manufacturing company may have its manufacturing facilities spread over different locations. Suppose it decides to undertake a revaluation of its plant and machinery. Selective revaluation will mean revaluing specific assets (such as the boiler, heater, central air-conditioning system) at all locations, or revaluing all items of Plant and Machinery at a particular location only. Such revaluation will lead to unrepresentative amounts being shown in the fixed asset register (FAR). In case of revaluation of specific assets of a class, while some assets will be shown at a revalued amount others will be shown at historical cost. The same will happen in case of revaluation of all assets of plant and machinery at a particular location only.

It is not consistent to value and depreciate fixed assets using different bases. Therefore, selective revaluation is generally not considered best practice.

===Preliminary considerations===
Revaluation will typically require liaison between the company&#x27;s Production Department, Accounts Department, Technical Department, and external appraisers. To commission the project they should set out their conclusions to the following questions:
* Why is the revaluation necessary?
* What is the most suitable method, taking into account the type of fixed assets, statutory requirements, availability of required information? Should the values arrived at by one method be crosschecked with the values derived from another method?
* What assets are to be revalued?
* What is the period within which the revaluation has to be completed?
* What guidelines should be laid down for the revaluation?
* What modifications will be required in the FAR to show revalued figures in place of historical figures? Similarly, depreciation will be computed twice. One takes into account the historical cost, and the other as per revalued figures.

==Upward revaluation==
The FASB in the U.S. does not allow upward revaluation of fixed assets to reflect fair market values although it is compulsory to account for impairment costs in fixed assets (downward revaluation of fixed assets) as per FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

In other countries, upward revaluation is mainly done for fixed assets such as land, and real estate whose value keeps rising from year to year. It seems the concept of upward revaluation of fixed assets such as real estate has not been widely welcomed by a majority of companies in USA on account of fear of paying higher property and capital gains taxes. Further, the provision against upward restatement ensures conservative valuation.

The United Kingdom, Australia, and India allow upward revaluation in the values of fixed assets to bring them in consonance with fair market values. However, the law requires disclosure of the basis of revaluation, amount of revaluation made to each class of assets (for a specified period after the financial year in which revaluation is made), and other information. Similarly, the law prohibits payment of dividend out of any reserve created as a result of the upward revaluation of fixed assets. The law in Australia has been amended recently to allow for the payment of dividends from the increase in the value of non-current assets in certain instances where a company meets other liquidity tests (see section 254T of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)).

===Important points===
* Increase in the value of fixed assets because of revaluation of fixed assets is credited to &quot;Revaluation Reserve&quot;, and is not available for distribution as dividend. Revaluation Reserve is treated as a Capital Reserve.
* The increase in depreciation arising out of revaluation of fixed assets is debited to revaluation reserve and the normal depreciation to Profit and Loss account.
* Selection of the most suitable method of revaluation is extremely important. The most used method is the appraisal method. Methods such as indexation and reference to current market prices are also used. However, when these methods are used they are crosschecked with the values arrived at by using the appraisal method.
* When an asset is sold that has previously been revalued, the revaluation within the carrying value is debited to the Revaluation Reserve.
* When assets are revalued, every balance sheet shall show for a specified period of years, the amount of increase or decrease made in respect of each class of assets. Similarly, the increased/decreased value shall be shown in place of the original cost.
* In case of land and buildings, revaluation is desirable as their value generally increases over time, and is carried out every 3 to 5 years. In case of plant and machinery, revaluation is carried out only if there is a strong case for it. In case of depreciable assets such as vehicles, furniture and fittings or office equipment, revaluation is not carried out.
* Revaluation should not result in the net book value of an asset exceeding its recoverable value.

==Downward revaluation==
Revaluation does not mean only an upward revision in the book values of the asset. It can also mean a downward revision (also called impairment) in the book values of the assets. However, any downward revision in the book values of the assets is immediately written off to the Profit and Loss account. Under IFRS, an asset is considered to be impaired (and is thus written down) if its carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset&#x27;s value in use (present value of future values) or net realizable value.

==Successive revaluations==
An upward revaluation of a fixed asset which has been previously subject to downward revaluation, an amount of the upward revaluation equal to the amount previously expensed is credited back to the Profit and Loss Account.

:Example:
:Machinery &#x27;A&#x27; is purchased on 01-04-1999 for $100,000. It is depreciated using the Straight Line Method at the rate of 10% p.a.

<doc id="901613" wikidata="Q6667502" url="?curid=901613" title="Logical framework">
<text>In logic, a logical framework provides a means to define (or present) a logic as a signature in a higher-order type theory in such a way that provability of a formula in the original logic reduces to a type inhabitation problem in the framework type theory. This approach has been used successfully for (interactive) automated theorem proving. The first logical framework was Automath; however, the name of the idea comes from the more widely known Edinburgh Logical Framework, LF. Several more recent proof tools like Isabelle are based on this idea. Unlike a direct embedding, the logical framework approach allows many logics to be embedded in the same type system.

==Overview==
A logical framework is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules and proofs by means of a dependently typed lambda calculus. Syntax is treated in a style similar to, but more general than Per Martin-Löf&#x27;s system of arities.

To describe a logical framework, one must provide the following:

# A characterization of the class of object-logics to be represented;
# An appropriate meta-language;
# A characterization of the mechanism by which object-logics are represented.

This is summarized by:

:&quot;&quot;Framework = Language + Representation&quot;.&quot;

==LF==
In the case of the LF logical framework, the meta-language is the λΠ-calculus. This is a system of first-order dependent function types which are related by the propositions as types principle to first-order minimal logic. The key features of the λΠ-calculus are that it consists of entities of three levels: objects, types and kinds (or type classes, or families of types). It is predicative, all well-typed terms are strongly normalizing and Church-Rosser and the property of being well-typed is decidable. However, type inference is undecidable.

A logic is represented in the LF logical framework by the judgements-as-types representation mechanism. This is inspired by Per Martin-Löf&#x27;s development of Kant&#x27;s notion of judgement, in the 1983 Siena Lectures. The two higher-order judgements, the hypothetical formula_1 and the general, formula_2, correspond to the ordinary and dependent function space, respectively. The methodology of judgements-as-types is that judgements are represented as the types of their proofs. A logical system formula_3 is represented by its signature which assigns kinds and types to a finite set of constants that represents its syntax, its judgements and its rule schemes. An object-logic&#x27;s rules and proofs are seen as primitive proofs of hypothetico-general judgements formula_4.

An implementation of the LF logical framework is provided by the Twelf system at Carnegie Mellon University. Twelf includes
* a logic programming engine
* meta-theoretic reasoning about logic programs (termination, coverage, etc.)
* an inductive meta-logical theorem prover

<text>Morpho hecuba, the sunset morpho, is a Neotropical butterfly and the largest species in the genus &quot;Morpho&quot;. Its wingspan can reach , but is usually from . &quot;&quot;M. hecuba&quot; is the largest known Morpho and one may also call it the most interesting, on account of its habits, its susceptibility to climatic influences and its tendency to develop polychromatic forms in both sexes.&quot;

==Geographic range==
The sunset morpho is only found in the northern Amazon basin and the Guianas.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;M. hecuba&quot; has several subspecies and has sometimes also included &quot;M. cisseis&quot; as a subspecies.

==Behaviour==
&quot;We are indebted to Dr. Hahnel for the most detailed information of its habits of flight. Hahnel calls it the king of the forest, and says that it traverses a wider area than any other butterfly, travelling perhaps 30 km. or more in two or three hours, continuous flight in quest of its mate, which it follows persistently for whole days, quite alone, over woods and water-courses. In the distance the flight of &quot;Morpho hecuba&quot; looks quiet and slow, but nevertheless it moves quickly enough to evade the collector and newly emerged insects in particular adopt an impetuous pace during their first hours of flight. Sometimes it happens that one of these apparently quietly hovering forms suddenly darts head downwards, and in this event it seems only to rise again with difficulty. They are driven to these violent erratic movements by dragon-flies, which lie in wait for them especially in marshy places and molest them from the tips of dry twigs, apparently more out of wantonness than from a desire to catch them.&quot;

<text>Niel Gow (22 March 17271 March 1807) was a Scottish fiddler in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

== Early life ==

Gow was born in Strathbraan, Perthshire, in 1727, as the son of John Gow and Catherine McEwan. The family moved to Inver in Perthshire when Niel was an infant. He started playing the fiddle when very young, and at age 13 received his first formal lessons from one John Cameron of Grandtully. 

In spite of being something of a musical prodigy, he originally trained as a weaver, but eventually gave up that trade to become a full-time musician. He was widely considered the best fiddle player in Perthshire, an area which was renowned for its musicians—the story goes that at age 18 he entered a competition that was being judged by John McCraw, a blind musician, who awarded him the first prize and then went on to claim that he &quot;would ken his bow hand among a hunder[d] players&quot; (detect Niel&#x27;s style among a hundred players). This attracted the attention of the Duke of Atholl, who became Gow&#x27;s patron, and also ensured his employment for balls and dance parties put on by the local nobility. In time he became renowned as a fiddler.

== Musical career == 

According to John Glen (1895), Gow composed, or is credited with composing, eighty-seven dance tunes, &quot;some of which are excellent.&quot; These tunes form the backstay of Scottish country dance music even today. However, it must be said that he was not above claiming good material from other composers as his own; Glen claims that at least a quarter of the eighty-seven tunes are either derived from older tunes or are copies of tunes published earlier elsewhere, often under a different title. The &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen&quot; indicates that Gow&#x27;s air of &quot;Locherroch Side&quot; was the basis for Robert Burns&#x27; ballad, &quot;Oh! stay, sweet warbling Woodlark, stay.&quot; This &quot;borrowing&quot; was a common practice at the time and it did not seem to hurt his reputation; Henry Raeburn was commissioned to paint him several times.

Many of Gow&#x27;s compositions are still played today at ceilidhs and country dances. He himself spelled his name &quot;Niel&quot;, although others sometimes spell it &quot;Neil&quot; or even &quot;Neal&quot;. The National Records of Scotland attest that Gow himself used the name &#x27;Neil&#x27;. To add to the confusion, he had a musical grandson (by Nathaniel) who did spell his name &quot;Neil&quot;.

The annual Niel Gow Fiddle Festival takes place in Dunkeld and Birnam, Perthshire, Scotland. It was established in 2004 to celebrate the life and music of Gow, including a fund raising campaign to erect a memorial to him in Dunkeld and Birnam.

== Later life == 

Gow was married twice. His first wife was Margaret Wiseman, and they had five sons and three daughters. His sons William, Andrew (1760), Nathaniel (1763), and John (1764) all followed their father as fiddlers and composers of fiddle music; two of the daughters were Margaret (1759) and Grizel (1761). The youngest son, Daniel (1765), died in infancy; William died in 1791 at age 40, and Andrew died in 1794 at 34. Of Niel&#x27;s sons, Nathaniel had nearly two hundred tunes to his credit. 

As a widower, Gow married Margaret Urquhart from Perth in 1768, and they went on to share a happy marriage until she died in 1805, which prompted his composition of one of his most famous tunes: &quot;Niel Gow&#x27;s Lament for the Death of his Second Wife&quot;. 

Gow died at Inver on 1 March 1807, aged 79 or 80.

Following on from the efforts of the fund-raising campaign, a memorial statue of Gow was commissioned with David Annand as sculptor. It was finally erected and unveiled in December 2020.

The 20th-century English composer David Gow is a descendant of Gow. He commemorated the connection in his &quot;Six Diversions on an Ancestral Theme&quot;.

<doc id="901627" wikidata="Q1364539" url="?curid=901627" title="Human, All Too Human">
<text>Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits () is a book by 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, originally published in 1878. A second part, Assorted Opinions and Maxims (), was published in 1879, and a third part, The Wanderer and his Shadow (), followed in 1880.

The book is Nietzsche&#x27;s first in the aphoristic style that would come to dominate his writings, discussing a variety of concepts in short paragraphs or sayings. Reflecting an admiration of Voltaire as a free thinker, but also a break in his friendship with composer Richard Wagner two years earlier, Nietzsche dedicated the original 1878 edition of &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; &quot;to the memory of Voltaire on the celebration of the anniversary of his death, May 30, 1778&quot;. Instead of a preface, the first part originally included a quotation from Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;. Nietzsche later republished all three parts as a two-volume edition in 1886, adding a preface to each volume, and removing the Descartes quotation as well as the dedication to Voltaire.

==Background==
In 1876, Nietzsche broke with Wagner, and in the same year his increasingly bad health (possibly the early effects of a brain tumor) compelled him to request a leave of absence from his academic duties at the University of Basel. In the autumn of 1876, he joined his friend Paul Rée in Sorrento, at the home of a wealthy patron of the arts, Malwida von Meysenbug, and began work on &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;.

=== Inspiration ===
The genre of the aphorism was already well established at the time of writing this book: in the German tradition, Nietzsche&#x27;s most important predecessor was a figure of the Enlightenment, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, whose writing Nietzsche greatly admired. Nietzsche&#x27;s work is indebted also to Schopenhauer&#x27;s, particularly his &quot;Aphorisms for Practical Wisdom&quot; (1851). Above all else is the &quot;debt to the French tradition of the aphorism – for Nietzsche&#x27;s work is a deliberate turn westward&quot;. Nietzsche cites the French aphorists Jean de La Bruyère and Prosper Mérimée, and in Aphorism 221 celebrates Voltaire.

At the beginning of the second section, Nietzsche mentions La Rochefoucauld—named here as a model, the epitome of the aphorist—and it is known that Nietzsche had a copy of La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s &quot;Sentences et maximes&quot; (1665) in his library. He had been reading it shortly before beginning to write &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;, on the train ride to Sorrento. More than that of the other French aphorists mentioned, it is La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s work that lies behind that of Nietzsche.

==Style==
Unlike his first book, &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, which was written in essay style, &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; is a collection of aphorisms, a style which Nietzsche would use in many of his subsequent works.

The aphorisms of &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; range from a few words to a few pages, but most are short paragraphs. The 638 aphorisms of the first installment are divided by subject into nine sections, with a short poem as an epilogue. The eponymous phrase itself appears in Aphorism 35 (originally conceived as the first aphorism) &quot;when Nietzsche observes that maxims about human nature can help in overcoming life&#x27;s hard moments&quot;. Implicit also, is a drive to overcome what is &quot;human, all too human&quot; through understanding it, through philosophy. The second and third installments are an additional 408 and 350 aphorisms respectively.

Nietzsche&#x27;s work, while inspired by the work of aphorists like La Rochefoucauld who came before him, &quot;is unique&quot;; [H]e covers a range of issues far greater than the social and psychological area of interest to La Rochefoucauld. To the cynicism typical of the genre, Nietzsche brings a new dimension by his combination of nihilistic energy with historical consciousness. Finally, he expands the genre to include not merely insights, but argument as well.&quot; The aphorism &quot;allows for a loosely organised, shifting whole containing specific ideas but no iron-clad explanation for everything, – [it] constitutes the style that best represents his philosophy&quot;.

This book represents the beginning of Nietzsche&#x27;s &#x27;middle period&#x27;, with a break from German Romanticism and from Wagner and with a definite positivist slant. Reluctant to construct a systematic philosophy, this book comprises more a collection of debunkings of unwarranted assumptions than an interpretation; it &quot;contains the seeds of concepts crucial to Nietzsche&#x27;s later philosophy, such as the need to transcend conventional Christian morality&quot;. He uses his perspectivism and the idea of the will to power as explanatory devices, though the latter remains less developed than in his later thought.

==Structure and content==

=== Of First and Last Things ===
In this first section, Nietzsche deals with metaphysics, specifically its origins as relating to dreams, the dissatisfaction with oneself, and language as well.

=== On the History of Moral Feelings ===
This section, named in honor of his friend Paul Rée&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Moral Sensations&quot;, Nietzsche challenges the Christian idea of good and evil, as it was philosophized by Arthur Schopenhauer.
&quot;At the waterfall.&quot; When we see a waterfall, we think we see freedom of will and choice in the innumerable turnings, windings, breakings of the waves; but everything is necessary; each movement can be calculated mathematically. Thus it is with human actions; if one were omniscient, one would be able to calculate each individual action in advance, each step in the progress of knowledge, each error, each act of malice. To be sure the acting man is caught in his illusion of volition; if the wheel of the world were to stand still for a moment and an omniscient, calculating mind were there to take advantage of this interruption, he would be able to tell into the farthest future of each being and describe every rut that wheel will roll upon. The acting man&#x27;s delusion about himself, his assumption that free will exists, is also part of the calculable mechanism.
=== From the Soul of Artists and Writers ===
Nietzsche uses this section to denounce the idea of divine inspiration in art, claiming that great art is the result of hard work, not a higher power or &#x27;genius&#x27;. This can be interpreted as a veiled attack on his former friend Wagner (a strong believer in genius), though Nietzsche never mentions him by name, instead simply using the term &#x27;the artist&#x27;.

=== Signs of Higher and Lower Culture ===

Here, Nietzsche criticizes Charles Darwin, as he frequently does, for being naive and derivative of Thomas Hobbes and early English economists, as well as for being without an account of life from the &#x27;inside&#x27;. Consider, in this light, Darwin&#x27;s own introduction to the first edition of &quot;Origin&quot;; also Nietzsche&#x27;s critique to the effect that Darwinism, as typically understood, is trading in a new version of the Providential:
Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest importance. Every progress of the whole must be preceded by a partial weakening. The strongest natures retain the type, the weaker ones help to advance it.
Something similar also happens in the individual. There is rarely a degeneration, a truncation, or even a vice or any physical or &#x27;moral&#x27; loss without an advantage somewhere else. In a warlike and restless clan, for example, the sicklier man may have occasion to be alone, and may therefore become quieter and wiser; the one-eyed man will have one eye the stronger; the blind man may see deeper inwardly, and certainly hear better. To this extent, the famous theory of the survival of the fittest does not seem to be the only viewpoint from which to explain the progress of strengthening of a man or of a race.Nietzsche writes of the &#x27;free spirit&#x27; or &#x27;free thinker&#x27; (), and his role in society; a sort of proto-Übermensch, forming the basis of a concept he extensively explores in his later work, &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;. A free spirit is one who goes against the herd, and &quot;onwards along the path of wisdom&quot; in order to better society. &#x27;Better&#x27;, for Nietzsche, appears to mean ordered toward the production of rare genius and is hardly to be confused with what &#x27;a newspaper reader&#x27; as Nietzsche might put it, would expect. The essential thing to keep in mind in considering Zarathustra, in particular, is that Nietzsche presents Zarathustra as &quot;failing&quot;.

=== Man in Society and Women and Child ===
These two sections are made up of very short aphorisms on men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and the child&#x27;s nature or their &#x27;evolution&#x27; in Nietzsche&#x27;s subtle, anti-Darwinian sense. Scholar Ruth Abbey has commented of works from Nietzsche&#x27;s &#x27;middle period&#x27; that, &quot;Contrary to the common classification of Nietzsche as a misogynist, the works of the middle period do not openly denigrate or dismiss women... Nietzsche&#x27;s views on women were at this time more nuanced and less vitriolic than they became&quot;. In this section, Nietzsche remarks that the perfect woman is a &quot;higher type of human being than the perfect man: also something much rarer&quot;.

=== Man Alone with Himself ===
Like sections six and seven, Nietzsche&#x27;s aphorisms here are mostly short, but also poetic and at times could be interpreted as semi-autobiographical, in anticipation of the next volumes: &quot;He who has come only in part to a freedom of reason cannot feel on earth otherwise than as a wanderer&quot;.

Nietzsche also distinguishes the obscurantism of the metaphysicians and theologians from the more subtle obscurantism of Kant&#x27;s critical philosophy and modern philosophical skepticism, claiming that obscurantism is that which obscures existence rather than obscures ideas alone: &quot;The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence&quot;.

==Reception==
Within his lifetime, prior to his mental breakdown in 1889, few of Nietzsche&#x27;s books sold particularly well, and &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; was no exception. The first installment was originally printed in 1,000 copies in 1878, selling only 120 at the time, and selling less than half by 1886, when it was resold as the complete two-volume set. Though his friendship with Richard Wagner was nearly over, Wagner actually received a signed copy. Although he did not read it at first, saying Nietzsche would thank him for this one day, Wagner would later quote and respond to it in a number of works.

=== Oehler and Nazism ===
Most notoriously, &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; was used by archivist Max Oehler, a strong supporter of Hitler, as supposed evidence of Nietzsche&#x27;s support for nationalism and anti-Semitism, both of which he writes against. Oehler wrote an entire book, (&#x27;Friedrich Nietzsche and the German Future&#x27;), dealing with Nietzsche and his connection to nationalism (specifically National Socialism) and anti-Semitism, using quotes from &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;, though out of context. Nietzsche would speak against anti-Semitism in other works including &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; and, most strongly, in &quot;The Antichrist&quot;: &quot;An anti-Semite is certainly not any more decent because he lies as a matter of principle&quot;. In &quot;Zarathustra&quot;, Nietzsche set Wagner up as a straw man, lampooning his anti-Semitism in the process.

Oehler also had control of Nietzsche&#x27;s archive during the Nazis&#x27; rule, which he shared with Nietzsche&#x27;s sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, a Hitler supporter herself, until her death, when he took it over. It was not until much of Walter Kaufmann&#x27;s work in the 1950s through the 1970s that Nietzsche was able to shed this connection with nationalism and anti-Semitism.

== Translations ==
The work was first translated into English in 1908 by Alexander Harvey, a Belgian-born American journalist, and was published in Chicago by Charles. H. Kerr, a small but notable publishing house of socially progressive literature. Following this, a 1909 translation by writer Helen Zimmern was published as part of a complete edition of Nietzsche&#x27;s books in English.

The book was not translated in full by Walter Kaufmann when he translated most of Nietzsche&#x27;s works into English in the 1950s and 1960s. However, Kaufmann included excerpts from it in his edition of &quot;The Portable Nietzsche&quot; (New York: The Viking Press, 1954).

During the 1980s, the first part of the book was translated by Marion Faber and the whole work was translated by R.J. Hollingdale. Faber was critical of Zimmern&#x27;s &quot;antiquated Victorian style&quot; which, in her opinion, makes Nietzsche read &quot;like a fusty contemporary of Matthew Arnold&quot;. Faber further noted bowdlerizations and errors in Zimmern&#x27;s work. For example, in Aphorism 61, &quot;Schaf&quot; (&quot;sheep&quot;) is translated by Zimmern as &quot;fool&quot;, where the reference is to Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Ajax&quot; in which the hero charges a herd of sheep.

<text>Nimar / Nimad is the southwestern region of Madhya Pradesh state in west-central India. This region has sub-regions which include Nimar, Khargone Khandwa Barwani Burhanpur and Dhar.

The region lies south of the Vindhya Range, and consists of two portions of the Narmada and Tapti river valleys, separated by a section of the Satpura Range, about 15 miles (24 km) in breadth. On the highest peak, about 800 ft (244 m) above the plain and 1800 ft (549 m) above sea-level, stands the fortress of Asirgarh, commanding a pass which has for centuries been the chief highway between Upper India and the Deccan.

The Nimar region is home to the Nimadi language.

== History ==
According to historical records found in the Indore Gazetteer, Bija Gawli, also known as Bija Singh Ahir, held the position of king in Nimar during the 14th century. The Ain-i-Akbari, a significant historical document, makes reference to Khargao, a Mahal (Palace) located in Bijagarh, Nimar. As we progress into the fifteenth century, it becomes apparent that numerous Gawli or Ahir/Yadav chiefs took initiative in establishing small municipalities in southern Nimar, which notably included the Bijagarh fort. The Gazetteer firmly asserts that their dominion over these territories is an indisputable historical fact.

Later on Nimar was formed as a district of British India, in the Nerbudda Division of the Central Provinces. The administrative headquarters were at Khandwa; but the capital in Muslim times was Burhanpur. Area, 4273 mi² (11,067 km²), population (1901) 329,615. The staple crops were cotton and millet; ganja or Indian hemp was also allowed to be grown under government supervision. The Great Indian Peninsula railway ran through the district, and a branch of the Rajputana line from Indore joined it at Khandwa. There were factories for ginning and pressing cotton at Khandwa, and manufacture of gold-embroidered cloth at Burhanpur. The district contained extensive forests, and the government preserved a section known is the Punasa forest, which extended for about 120 miles (190 km) along the south bank of the Narmada, home to forests of teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;), sain (&quot;Terminalia tomentosa&quot;) and anjan (&quot;Hardwickia binata&quot;) trees.

Nimar was also a district in the princely state of Indore lying west of the British district on both banks of the Narmada. Area, 3871 mile² (10,026 km²); pop. (1901) 257,110. From 1823 onwards this tract, then belonging to Sindhia rulers of Gwalior, was under British management; in 1861 it was ceded in full sovereignty to the British, but in 1867 it passed to Holkar rulers of Indore as the result of an exchange of territory.

After Indian independence in 1947, The former British district became the Nimar District of the new state of Madhya Pradesh, with its administrative seat at Khandwa; the Nimar District of Indore state became the Nimar district of the new state of Madhya Bharat, with its administrative seat at Khargone. When Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956, The former Madhya Bharat district became West Nimar District, while the eastern district became East Nimar District. West Nimar district was split into the districts of Barwani and Khargone on 24 May 1998 and similarly East Nimar district was split into the districts of Khandwa and Burhanpur on 15 August 2003.
The population of this region according to the 2011 Census is 7,044,884 people.

<text>Natasha Anne Bedingfield (born 26 November 1981) is a British singer, songwriter and record producer. She released her debut album, &quot;Unwritten&quot;, in 2004, which contained primarily up-tempo pop songs and was influenced by R&amp;B music. It enjoyed international success with more than 2.3 million copies sold worldwide. Bedingfield received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the title track &quot;Unwritten&quot;, and at the 2005 and 2006 Brit Awards, she was nominated for Best British Female Artist. &quot;Unwritten&quot; also produced her only UK number one, &quot;These Words&quot;.

Her second album, &quot;N.B.&quot; (2007), yielded the UK top 10 singles &quot;I Wanna Have Your Babies&quot; and &quot;Soulmate&quot;. &quot;N.B.&quot; was not released in North America, but six tracks from it were included with seven new ones and released in 2008 under the name &quot;Pocketful of Sunshine&quot;, with the singles &quot;Love Like This&quot; and &quot;Pocketful of Sunshine&quot; earning success on the charts. In December 2010, Bedingfield released her third album in North America, &quot;Strip Me&quot;, with the song &quot;Strip Me&quot; charting on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at 91. Bedingfield has sold over 10 million albums and 10 million singles worldwide, totalling over 20 million records worldwide. In 2012, VH1 ranked Bedingfield number 66 on the list of 100 Greatest Women in Music.

==Early life==
Natasha Anne Bedingfield was born in England to New Zealander parents and grew up both in London and Auckland, New Zealand. Later she attended Lynfield College. When Bedingfield was a teenager, she and her siblings, Daniel and Nikola, formed a dance/electronic group, The DNA Algorithm. The group provided Bedingfield with the opportunity to explore different musical genres and expand her songwriting abilities. She provided vocals for the group which primarily performed dance-pop music about independence and empowerment, themes that would later be found in her own solo compositions. At age 14, Bedingfield sang vocals on Origins &quot;Refined Intricacy&quot; (Steelyard Records).

Bedingfield attended a year at the University of Greenwich, where she studied psychology, then left to concentrate on singing and songwriting. At first, she recorded demos in the garages of friends who had recording studios, which she presented to record companies. In the early 2000s, Bedingfield composed, wrote and recorded songs for Hillsong Church UK. Her songs appeared on the live albums &quot;Blessed&quot;, &quot;Shout God&#x27;s Fame&quot;, and the children&#x27;s album &quot;Jesus Is My Superhero&quot; by Hillsong Music Australia.

==Career==
===2003–2006: professional career and &quot;Unwritten&quot;===
 Bedingfield was introduced to Phonogenic founder and A&amp;R Paul Lisberg by the artist&#x27;s manager Gary Wilson. Lisberg was initially hesitant, later telling HitQuarters: &quot;[They] were good but weren&#x27;t right for us ... &quot; However, it was when, at a meeting together, Lisberg heard her singing ability and creative vocal ad-libbing first-hand that he became excited by Bedingfield&#x27;s potential. Label interest was later confirmed when a trial studio session together with writers Steve Kipner and Andrew Frampton produced songs that were in keeping with Lisberg&#x27;s vision for Phonogenic. Bedingfield signed a recording contract with BMG UK &amp; Ireland, through its imprint Phonogenic Records, in July 2003.

Her debut studio album &quot;Unwritten&quot; was released in September 2004 and featured collaborations with Steve Kipner, Danielle Brisebois, Nick Lachey, James Reilly, Andrew Frampton, Wayne Wilkins, Kara DioGuardi, Guy Chambers, Patrick Leonard and the rapper Bizarre. The album contained uptempo pop-rock songs and influences from R&amp;B music. Bedingfield&#x27;s lyrics focused on independence, opportunism and female empowerment. Reviews of the album were generally positive, and it was described as a &quot;well-made pop album for the new millennium&quot; by Allmusic. The album debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number one and reached the top thirty in the U.S. It sold well, reaching multi-platinum status in the UK and Gold status in the U.S. The first single released from the album was &quot;Single&quot;, which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. The song&#x27;s lyrics and accompanying music video depict Bedingfield&#x27;s single lifestyle. &quot;These Words&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. The song became Bedingfield&#x27;s first UK number one and US top twenty single. &quot;Unwritten&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in 2004: the song reached number six on the UK Singles Chart and it also became the most played song on US radio in 2006. &quot;I Bruise Easily&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single, it did not perform as well as its predecessors but was still a moderate success, reaching number twelve on the UK Singles Chart.

At the 2005 Brit Awards, Bedingfield was nominated for four awards, though did not win any of her nominated categories. She was also nominated for an award at the 2006 Brit Awards, and in 2007, she was nominated for &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance&quot; at the 2007 Grammy Awards, though was again unsuccessful in winning in any of her nominated categories.

===2007–2008: &quot;N.B.&quot; and &quot;Pocketful of Sunshine&quot;===

Bedingfield&#x27;s second album, &quot;N.B.&quot;, was released in Europe in April 2007. The album received mixed reviews by critics and peaked at number nine in the UK. &quot;I Wanna Have Your Babies&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, was moderately successful, reaching number seven in the UK, number eight in Ireland and the top fifty in various other markets. &quot;Soulmate&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on 2 July 2007 and also peaked at number seven in the UK. To promote &quot;N.B.&quot;, Bedingfield embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour in May 2007.

On 1 July 2007, Bedingfield performed &quot;Unwritten&quot; at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event which celebrated the life of Princess Diana almost ten years after her death. The North American version of her second album, titled &quot;Pocketful of Sunshine&quot;, featured six songs from &quot;N.B.&quot;. The album was released on 22 January 2008, after the lead single, &quot;Love like This&quot;, was released in September 2007 and charted at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The title track was released as the second single in February 2008 and peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On 18 January 2008, Bedingfield&#x27;s UK tour was cancelled for the second time, one month before it was supposed to start, so she could spend more time promoting her album in the U.S. In August 2008, Bedingfield and other singers including Beyoncé, Rihanna, Melissa Etheridge, Carrie Underwood, Miley Cyrus, Leona Lewis and Mariah Carey recorded the charity single, &quot;Just Stand Up&quot; produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, to support &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot;. On 5 September 2008, the singers performed it live on TV.

In a 2008 rockumentary, Call+Response, headed by Justin Dillon, Bedingfield performed acoustic versions of &quot;Unwritten&quot; and &quot;Soulmate&quot; in support of the film&#x27;s cause: a movement against modern slavery and human trafficking.

<doc id="901635" wikidata="Q11223801" url="?curid=901635" title="IBM 4300">
<text>The IBM 4300 series are mid-range systems compatible with System/370 that were sold from 1979 through 1992. They featured modest electrical and cooling requirements, and thus did not require a data center environment. They had a disruptive effect on the market, allowing customers to provide internal IBM computing services at a cost point lower than commercial time-sharing services. All 4300 processors used a 3278-2A, 3279-C or 3205 display console rather than a 3210 or 3215 keyboard/printer console.

==Models==

Each model - 4331, 4341, 4361, and 4381 - had various sub-models, such as the 4341 model 1 (or 4341-1) and 4341 model 2 (4341-2).

The 4381-13 through 4381-24 (announced in 1987) were entry-level machines for the 370-XA architecture. They were positioned between the IBM 9370 and IBM 3090 in performance at the time of announcement.

The 4381-3, 4381-14, 4381-24 and 4381-92 are dual-CPU models. Other models included 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 90 and 91.

==IBM 4321==
The IBM 4321 was announced on 18 November 1981.

==IBM 4331==
The IBM 4331 (and the 4341) were announced on 30 January 1979. It came with an integrated adapter that permitted attaching up to 16 of two newly introduced direct-access storage devices (DASD):
* The IBM 3310, described as having &quot;a storage capacity of 64.5 million characters&quot;, was to be used with &quot;Storage disks .. sealed to reduce the possibility of damage, loss, misuse or contamination&quot;.
* The IBM 3370 with up to 571 million characters could also be used with an IBM 4341.

The 4331 was withdrawn on 18 November 1981.

==IBM 4341==
The IBM 4341 (and the 4331) were announced on 30 January 1979. Like the 4331, it came with an integrated adapter that permitted attaching up to 16 of the newly introduced IBM 3370 DASD. The 4341 did not support the much lower capacity IBM 3310. The 4341 Introduced the Extended Control Program Support:VM (ECPS:VM), Extended Control Program Support:VS1 (ECPS:VS1) and Extended Control Program Support:Virtual Storage Extended (ECPS:VSE) features. The 4341-2 introduced the Extended Control Program Support:MVS (ECPS:MVS) option, a subset of System/370 extended facility.

On 20 October 1982, IBM announced a new entry-level 4341 model, Model Group 9 and a new top-of-the-line 4341, Model Group 12. Model Group 12 included the Dual Address Space (DAS) facility.

The 4341 was withdrawn on 11 February 1986.

==IBM 4361==
The IBM 4361 Model Groups 4 and 5 were announced on 15 September 1983.

Model Group 3 was announced the following year on 12 September 1984.

===New features===
Among the new/optional features for the 4361 were:
* Auto-Start—automatically turns on the processor by telephone via the Remote Operator Control Facility or at a predetermined time and day of the week. The processor powers on and proceeds with initial microcode load, sets the clock and loads the system.

====APL keyboard====
* A Workstation Adapter that includes support for terminals with APL keyboards, supporting the APL syntax and symbols.

====High-Accuracy Arithmetic Facility====
While floating-point arithmetic has long been part of computing history, and was present in System/360, this feature&#x27;s advancement, conceptualization of which, as Karlsruhe Accurate Arithmetic, had been under development for decades, was implemented as an optional feature on the 4361.

The 4361 was withdrawn on 17 February 1987.

==IBM 4381==
The IBM 4381 had a greater longevity than any of the above systems.

Model Groups 1 and 2 were announced Sep 15, 1983 and withdrawn on 11 February 1986.

Model Group 3 was announced on 25 October 1984 and withdrawn on 11 February 1986.
Model Groups 11, 12, 13 and 14 were announced on 11 February 1986.

Model Groups 21, 22, 23 and 24 were announced on 19 May 1987 and withdrawn on 19 August 1992.

==Operating systems==
New releases of:
* Disk Operating System/Virtual Storage Extended (DOS/VSE)
* Virtual Machine Facility/370 (VM/370) Release 6
* Operating System/Virtual Storage 1 (OS/VS1) Release 7
supported the 4300 series as well as other System/370-compatible processors.

For the 4321 and 4331:
* Small Systems Executive/Virtual Storage Extended (SSX/VSE), a simplified version of the DOS/VSE operating system for the IBM 4321 and IBM 4331 processors.

==Other==
* Hughes Aircraft Company was the first IBM customer to install Endicott&#x27;s initial IBM 4341 processor
* The IBM 4331 Model 2 was developed by the Boeblingen lab and manufactured in Endicott.
* The IBM 4341 Model 2 was developed by the intermediate systems group, and manufactured by SPD, in Endicott.
* Subsequent processors had development and manufacturing activities in Endicott, Havant, Boeblingen, Valencia, and Sumare.

<doc id="901640" wikidata="Q538396" url="?curid=901640" title="The Antichrist (book)">
<text>The Antichrist () is a book by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, originally published in 1895.

Although the work was written in 1888, its content made Franz Overbeck and Heinrich Köselitz delay its publication, along with &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;. 

== Content ==

===Preface===
Nietzsche claims in the preface to have written the book for a very limited readership. To understand the book, he asserts that the reader &quot;must be honest in intellectual matters to the point of hardness to so much as endure my seriousness, my passion&quot;. He disregards all other readers:Very well, then! of that sort only are my readers, my true readers, my readers foreordained: of what account are the &quot;rest&quot;?—The rest are merely humanity.—One must make one&#x27;s self superior to humanity, in power, in &quot;loftiness&quot; of soul,—in contempt.

===Decadent values===
In section 1, Nietzsche expresses his dissatisfaction with modernity, listing his dislikes for the contemporary &quot;lazy peace&quot;, &quot;cowardly compromise&quot;, &quot;tolerance&quot; and &quot;resignation&quot;.

Nietzsche introduces his concept of &quot;will to power&quot; in § 2, using its relation to define notions of &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot;: What is good?—Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself, in man. What is evil?—Whatever springs from weakness. What is happiness?—The feeling that power &quot;increases&quot;—that resistance is overcome.Nietzsche follows this passage with provocative and shocking language:The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of &quot;our&quot; charity. And one should help them to it. What is more harmful than any vice?—Practical sympathy for the botched and the weak—Christianity...This is an example of Nietzsche&#x27;s reaction against Schopenhauer, who had based all morality on compassion. Nietzsche, on the contrary, praises &quot;virtue free of moralic acid&quot;.

Nietzsche goes on to say that mankind, out of fear, has bred a weak, sick type of human. He blames Christianity for demonizing strong, higher humans. Pascal, he claims, was an intellectually strong man who was depraved by Christianity&#x27;s teaching of original sin.

Mankind, according to Nietzsche, is corrupt and its highest values are depraved. He asserts that &quot;all the values in which mankind at present summarizes its highest desiderata are &quot;decadence values&quot;&quot;. Mankind is depraved because it has lost its instincts and prefers what is harmful to it: I consider life itself instinct for growth, for durability, for accumulation of forces, for &quot;power&quot;: where the will to power is lacking there is decline.Depravity results because &quot;&quot;nihilistic&quot; values dominate under the holiest names&quot;.

===Christian pity===
Christianity, as a religion of peace, is despised by Nietzsche. According to Nietzsche&#x27;s account, pity has a depressive effect, loss of vitality and strength, and is harmful to life. It also preserves that which should naturally be destroyed.

In Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy, which Nietzsche sees as the most nihilistic and opposed to life, pity is the highest virtue of all. But, for Nietzsche:[I]n the role of &quot;protector&quot; of the miserable, it is a prime agent in the promotion of &quot;décadence&quot;—pity persuades to extinction... Of course, one doesn&#x27;t say &quot;extinction&quot;: one says &quot;the other world,&quot; or &quot;God,&quot; or &quot;the &quot;true&quot; life,&quot; or Nirvana, salvation, blessedness... This innocent rhetoric, from the realm of religious-ethical balderdash, appears &quot;a good deal less innocent&quot; when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals beneath sublime words: the tendency to &quot;destroy life&quot;. Schopenhauer was hostile to life: that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue.He goes on further, mentioning that the moderns Leo Tolstoy and Richard Wagner adopted Schopenhauer&#x27;s viewpoint. Aristotle, who lived in 384–322 BC, on the other hand, recognized the unhealthiness of pity and prescribed tragedy as a purgative.

===Scientific method===
Nietzsche considers a free spirit to be the embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Nietzsche claims that, prior to his time, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt.

===Christian God===
Nietzsche claims that the Christian religion and its morality are based on imaginary fictions. Nietzsche opposes the Christian concept of God because: God degenerated into the &quot;contradiction of life&quot;. Instead of being its transfiguration and eternal Yea! In him war is declared on life, on nature, on the will to live! God becomes the formula for every slander upon the &quot;here and now,&quot; and for every lie about the &quot;beyond&quot;! Recalling Schopenhauer&#x27;s description of the denial of the will to live and the subsequent empty nothingness, Nietzsche proclaims of the Christian God that &quot;[i]n him nothingness is deified, and the will to nothingness is made holy!...&quot;

Nietzsche criticizes the &quot;strong races of northern Europe&quot; for accepting the Christian God and not creating a new god of their own: &quot;Two thousand years have come and gone—and not a single new god!&quot;. He maintains that the traditional &quot;pitiful god of Christian monotono-theism&quot; supports &quot;all the instincts of &quot;décadence&quot;, all the cowardices and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction!&quot;

===Buddhism vs Christianity===
Although he criticizes both Christianity and Buddhism, Nietzsche considers the latter to be more realistic as it poses objective problems and does not use the concept of God.

Nietzsche claims that Buddhism is &quot;beyond good and evil&quot; because it has developed past the &quot;self-deception that lies in moral concepts&quot;.

===Origin of Christianity===

====Jewish priesthood====
Jewish, and subsequently—to a greater degree—Christian, priests survived and attained power by siding with decadents, Nietzsche claims. They turned against the natural world. Their &quot;instincts of &quot;ressentiment&quot;&quot; against those who were well–constituted led them to &quot;invent an &quot;other&quot; world in which the &quot;acceptance of life&quot; appeared as the most evil and abominable thing imaginable&quot;.

To survive, the Jewish priests made use of the decadents and their large population. The Jews were not decadents, themselves—they are the &quot;very opposite&quot;. Rather, according to Nietzsche, they have &quot;the most powerful national will to live, that has ever appeared on earth&quot;. However, &quot;they have simply been forced into &quot;appearing&quot;&quot; as decadents, to &quot;put themselves at the head of all &quot;décadent&quot; movements (—for example, the Christianity of Paul—), and so make of them something stronger than any party frankly saying &quot;Yes&quot; to life&quot;.

=====Five stages of denaturalizing values=====
#Israel&#x27;s Yahweh/Jahveh &quot;was an expression of its consciousness of power, its joy in itself, its hopes for itself&quot;. Because he is their God, they considered him to be the God of justice. The Jews affirmed themselves, realized their own power, and had a good conscience. Even after internal anarchy and Assyrian invasions weakened Israel, it retained its worship of God as a king who is both soldier and judge.
#Concept of God is falsified: Yahweh became a demanding god. &quot;Jahveh, the god of &quot;justice&quot;—he is in accord with Israel &quot;no more&quot;, he no longer vizualizes the national egoism&quot;.
#Concept of morality is falsified: morality is no longer an expression of life and growth. Rather, it opposes life by presenting wellbeing as a dangerous temptation. The public notion of this God becomes weaponized by clerical agitators, who &quot;interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment for obedience or disobedience to him, for &#x27;sin&#x27;&quot;
#History of Israel is falsified: The &quot;great&quot; epoch becomes an epoch of decay. &quot;the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was transformed into a &quot;punishment&quot; for that great age—during which priests had not yet come into existence&quot;. The past is translated into religious terms; it was a record of guilt, punishment, piety, and reward in relation to Yahweh. A moral world order is established which assigns value to actions that obey the will of God (and which claims that this general will, i.e. the right way of life for everyone, is eternal and unchanging). Priests teach that &quot;the &quot;ruling power&quot; of the will of God, expressed as punishment and reward according to the degree of obedience, is demonstrated in the destiny of a nation, of an individual&quot;.
#God&#x27;s will is revealed in the holy scripture: the sacred book formulates the will of God and specifies what is to be given to the priests. The priest sanctifies and bestows all value: disobedience of God (the priest) is &#x27;sin;&#x27; subjection to God (the priest) is redemption. Priests use &#x27;sin&#x27; to gain and hold power:From this time forward things were so arranged that the priest became indispensable everywhere; at all the great natural events of life, at birth, at marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the sacrifice&#x27; (that is, at meal-times), the holy parasite put in his appearance, and proceeded to &quot;denaturize&quot; it.

====Revolt against Jewish priesthood====
The Jewish church opposed and negated nature, reality, and the world as being sinful and unholy. Christianity then negated the Jewish church and its holy, chosen people, according to Nietzsche:The phenomenon is of the first order of importance: the small insurrectionary movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth is simply the Jewish instinct &quot;redivivus&quot;—in other words, it is the priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the priest as a fact; it is the discovery of a state of existence even more fantastic than any before it, of a vision of life even more &quot;unreal&quot; than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization.The Jewish church and the Jewish nation received this rebellion as a threat to its existence:This saintly anarchist, who aroused the people of the abyss, the outcasts and &quot;sinners,&quot; the Chandala of Judaism, to rise in revolt against the established order of things...this man was certainly a political criminal... This is what brought him to the cross... He died for his &quot;own&quot; sins... 

====The Redeemer type====
Nietzsche criticizes Ernest Renan&#x27;s attribution of the concepts genius and hero to Jesus. Nietzsche thinks that the word &quot;idiot&quot; best describes Jesus.

Nietzsche asserts that the psychological reality of redemption was a &quot;new way of life, &quot;not&quot; a new faith&quot;. It is &quot;[t]he deep instinct which prompts the Christian how to &quot;live&quot; so that he will feel that he is &#x27;in heaven&#x27;&quot;. The Christian is known by his acts. He offers no resistance to evil, He has no anger and wants no revenge. Blessedness is not promised on conditions, as in Judaism. The Gospel&#x27;s glad tidings are that there is no distinction between God and man. There is no Judaic concern for sin, prayers, rituals, forgiveness, repentance, guilt, punishment, or faith:[H]e &quot;knew&quot; that it was only by a &quot;way&quot; of life that one could feel one&#x27;s self &#x27;divine,&#x27; &#x27;blessed,&#x27; &#x27;evangelical,&#x27; a &#x27;child of God.&#x27; &quot;Not&quot; by &#x27;repentance,&#x27; &quot;not&quot; by &#x27;prayer and forgiveness&#x27; is the way to God: &quot;only the Gospel way&quot; leads to God—it is &quot;itself&quot; &#x27;God!&#x27;

===History of Christianity===

====Opposite development====
Nietzsche sees a world–historical irony in the way that the Christian Church developed in antithetical opposition to the Evangel and the Gospel of early Christianity.A &quot;sickly barbarism&quot; finally lifts itself to power as the church—the church, that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty, to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all spontaneous and kindly humanity.—&quot;Christian&quot; values—&quot;noble&quot; values.

====Paul and the promise of eternal life====

The apostles claimed that Jesus&#x27; death was a sacrifice of an innocent man for the sins of the guilty. But &quot;Jesus him self had done away with the very concept of &#x27;guilt,&#x27; he denied that there was any gulf fixed between God and man; he &quot;lived&quot; this unity between God and man, and that was precisely &quot;his&quot; &#x27;glad tidings&#x27;&quot;

To claim that there is life after death, the apostles ignored Jesus&#x27; example of blessed living. Paul emphasizes the concept of &quot;immortality&quot; in First Corinthians 15:17, as Nietzsche explains:St. Paul...gave a logical quality to that conception, that &quot;indecent&quot; conception, in this way: &quot;&#x27;If&quot; Christ did not rise from the dead, then all our faith is in vain!&#x27;—And at once there sprang from the Gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises, the &quot;shameless&quot; doctrine of personal immortality... Paul even preached it as a &quot;reward&quot;...Paul used the promise of life after death as a way to seize tyrannical power over the masses of lower-class people. This changed Christianity from a peace movement that achieves actual happiness into a religion whose final judgment offers possible resurrection and eternal life. Paul falsified the history of Christianity, the history of Israel, and the history of mankind by making them all seem to be a preparation for the crucifixion. &quot;The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all reason, all natural instinct—henceforth, everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion&quot;.

Nietzsche claims that Paul&#x27;s pretense of holiness and his use of priestly concepts were typically Jewish. Christianity separated itself from Judaism as though it was the chosen religion, &quot;just as if the Christian were the meaning, the salt, the standard and even the &quot;last judgment&quot; of all the rest&quot;.

====The Holy Lie and belief====

Lying, or not wanting to see as one sees, is a trait of those who are devoted to a party or faction. Lying is used by all priests, be they pagan, Jewish, or Christian:[T]he right to lie and the &quot;shrewd dodge&quot; of &#x27;revelation&#x27; belong to the general priestly type... The &#x27;law,&#x27; the &#x27;will of God,&#x27; the &#x27;holy book,&#x27; and &#x27;inspiration&#x27;—all these things are merely words for the conditions &quot;under&quot; which the priest comes to power and &quot;with&quot; which he maintains his power... 

===Condemnation===
Nietzsche concludes his work with the insistence that Christianity &quot;turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul... [I]t lives by distress; it &quot;creates&quot; distress to make &quot;itself&quot; immortal&quot;.

&quot;To breed out of &quot;humanitas&quot; a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest instincts&quot;, in Nietzsche&#x27;s view, is the spirit of Christianity. Nietzsche believes the &quot;&#x27;humanitarianism&#x27; of Christianity&quot; to be a conspiracy &quot;against health, beauty, well-being, intellect, &quot;kindness&quot; of soul—&quot;against life itself&quot;&quot;.

Nietzsche suggests that time be calculated from &quot;today&quot;, the date of this book, whereby &#x27;Year One&#x27; would begin on 30 September 1888—&quot;The transvaluation of all values!&quot;

==Thoughts on Jesus==

In his earlier works, Nietzsche did not distinguish the teachings of Jesus from historic Christianity. However, in late 1887 and early 1888, he analyzed Tolstoy&#x27;s essay &quot;What I Believe&quot;. Nietzsche&#x27;s view of Jesus in &quot;The Antichrist&quot; follows Tolstoy in separating Jesus from the Church and emphasizing the concept of &quot;non-resistance&quot;, but uses it as a basis for his own development of the &quot;psychology of the Savior&quot;.

Nietzsche does not demur of Jesus, conceding that he was the only one &quot;true&quot; Christian. He presents a Christ whose own inner life consisted of &quot;wit, the blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the &quot;inability&quot; to be an enemy&quot;.

Nietzsche heavily criticizes the organized institution of Christianity and its class of priests. Christ&#x27;s evangelism consisted of the good news that the &#x27;kingdom of God&#x27; is within &quot;you&quot;: &quot;What is the meaning of &#x27;Glad Tidings&#x27;?—The true life, the life eternal has been found—it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in &quot;you&quot;; it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions&quot;, whereby &quot;sin&quot; is abolished and away from &quot;all keeping of distances&quot; between man and God.

&quot;What the &#x27;glad tidings&#x27; tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of heaven belongs to &quot;children&quot;&quot;.

== Publication ==

===Title===
The German title, &quot;Der Antichrist&quot;, is ambiguous and open to two interpretations: the &quot;Antichrist&quot;, or the &quot;Anti-Christian&quot;. However, its use within the work generally admits only an &quot;Anti-Christian&quot; meaning. H. L. Mencken&#x27;s 1918 translation and R. J. Hollingdale&#x27;s 1968 translation both title their editions as &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot;; and Walter Kaufmann uses &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, while no major translation uses &quot;The Anti-Christian&quot;. Kaufmann considers &quot;The Antichrist&quot; the more appropriate way to render the German: &quot;[a] translation of the title as &#x27;The Antichristian&#x27; [...] overlooks that Nietzsche plainly means to be as provocative as possible&quot;.

===Sanity===
This book was written shortly before Nietzsche&#x27;s infamous nervous breakdown. However, as one scholar notes, &quot;the &quot;Antichrist&quot; is unrelievedly vituperative, and would indeed sound insane were it not informed in its polemic by a structure of analysis and a theory of morality and religion worked out elsewhere&quot;.

==Suppressed passages==

===&quot;The word idiot&quot;===
Section 29 originally contains three words that were suppressed by Nietzsche&#x27;s sister in 1895: &quot;das Wort Idiot&quot; or, &quot;the word idiot&quot;. H. L. Mencken&#x27;s English translation does not contain these words. However, in 1931, the words were reinstated by Josef Hofmiller. Likewise, English translations by Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale also contain them. According to Kaufmann, Nietzsche was referring to Dostoevsky&#x27;s book &quot;The Idiot&quot; and its naïve protagonist. The passage reads:

===Christ&#x27;s words to the thief on the cross===
In § 35, Nietzsche wanted to convey the idea that, to Christ, Heaven is a subjective state of mind. To accomplish this goal, Nietzsche parodied a passage from the New Testament, which the Nietzsche Archive, headed by Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, decided to suppress so that there would be no doubt as to the strict correctness of Nietzsche&#x27;s use of the Bible.

According to Nietzsche, one of the thieves, who was also being crucified, said, &quot;This was truly a divine man, a child of God!&quot; Nietzsche had Christ reply, &quot;If you feel this, you are in Paradise, you are a child of God&quot;. In the Bible, only Luke related a dialogue between Christ and the thief in which the thief said, &quot;This man has done nothing wrong&quot; to which, Christ replies, &quot;Today I tell you, you will be with me in Paradise&quot;. Nietzsche had the thief speaking the words that the centurion later spoke in Luke 23:47, Matthew 27:54, and Mark 15:39. In these passages, Christ was called the &#x27;Son of God&#x27; by the soldier. The Nietzsche Archives&#x27; suppression was lifted in later editions and now appears exactly as Nietzsche wrote.

The full passage reads:

===A young prince===
In § 38, there is a reference to a young prince who professes to be a Christian but acts in a very worldly manner. The passage about this was suppressed to avoid comparison to Wilhelm II. According to Mazzino Montinari, this passage was never printed in any edition prepared by the Nietzsche Archive. However, it did appear in the pocketbook edition of 1906.

The full passage reads:

===Anno Domini===
Nietzsche, in § 62, criticizes the reckoning of time from Christ&#x27;s birth (&quot;anno Domini&quot;). This passage was judged by Franz Overbeck and Heinrich Köselitz to be unworthy of publication. According to Mazzino Montinari, this passage was restored in the 1899 edition, appearing in all subsequent editions.

The full passage reads:

===Decree against Christianity===
Also suppressed was Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Decree against Christianity&quot; (or &quot;Law Against Christianity&quot;). This part was added back on the 1889 edition and the following editions of &quot;The Antichrist&quot;. This part consists of seven propositions that can be summarised as such:

# Every type of anti-nature is depraved 
# Participation in religion is an assassination attempt on public morality
# The location from which Christianity has spread should be eradicated
# The Christian teaching on chastity is a public instigation to anti-nature 
# The Christian priest is a chandala – he should be ostracized, starved
# What was before called &quot;holy&quot; and &quot;God&quot; is to be called criminal and cursed
# &quot;The rest follows from this&quot;

<doc id="901662" wikidata="Q234765" url="?curid=901662" title="Nadezhda Mandelstam">
<text>Nadezhda Yakovlevna Mandelstam (; []; 29 December 1980) was a Russian Jewish writer and educator, and the wife of the poet Osip Mandelstam who died in 1938 in a transit camp to the &quot;gulag&quot; of Siberia. She wrote two memoirs about their lives together and the repressive Stalinist regime: &quot;Hope Against Hope&quot; (1970) and &quot;Hope Abandoned&quot; (1974), both first published in the West in English, translated by Max Hayward.

Of these books the critic Clive James wrote, &quot;&quot;Hope Against Hope&quot; puts her at the centre of the liberal resistance under the Soviet Union. A masterpiece of prose as well as a model of biographical narrative and social analysis it is mainly the story of the terrible last years of persecution and torment before the poet [her husband Osip] was murdered. The sequel, &quot;Hope Abandoned&quot;, is about the author&#x27;s personal fate, and is in some ways even more terrible, because, as the title implies, it is more about horror as a way of life than as an interruption to normal expectancy. [The two books] were key chapters in the new bible that the twentieth century had written for us.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Nadezhda Yakovlevna Khazina was born in Saratov, southern Russia, the youngest of four children (she had a sister and two brothers) of a middle-class Jewish family. Her parents were Yakov Arkadyevich Khazin and Vera Yakovlevna Khazina, and the family was wealthy enough to travel. Her mother was among the first group of women in the Soviet Union to complete training as a medical doctor, and her father was an attorney. The family did not practice Judaism, and kept Russian Orthodox holidays. Later they converted to Christianity. The family moved to Kiev (now in Ukraine), for her father&#x27;s work, and the greater cultural and educational opportunities of the larger city. There she attended school. After gymnasium (secondary school), Nadezhda studied art.

==Life and memoirs==
Nadezhda met the poet Osip Mandelstam at a nightclub in Kiev in 1919, and they started a relationship which led to marriage in 1921–1922. They lived in Ukraine at first, but moved to Petrograd in 1922. Later they lived in Moscow, and Georgia.

Osip was arrested in 1934 for his poem entitled &quot;Stalin Epigram&quot; and exiled to Cherdyn, in Perm Oblast; Nadezhda went with him. Later the sentence was lightened and they were allowed to move to Voronezh in southwestern Russia, but were still banished from the largest cities, which were the artistic and cultural centers.

After Osip Mandelstam&#x27;s second arrest in May 1938 and his subsequent death at the transit camp &quot;Vtoraya Rechka&quot; near Vladivostok that year, Nadezhda Mandelstam led an almost nomadic life. Given the repression of the times, she tried to dodge an expected arrest, and frequently changed places of residence and took only temporary jobs. On at least one occasion, in Kalinin, the NKVD came for her the day after she had fled.

As her mission in life, she worked to preserve her husband&#x27;s poetic heritage, with the goal of publication one day. She managed to keep most of it memorized because she did not trust paper. Many years later, she was able to work with other writers to have it published.

Through the terrible years, Nadezhda Mandelstam gained her college degree and taught English in various provincial towns. After the death of Joseph Stalin on 5 March 1953, when government&#x27;s repression eased, she returned to her studies and completed her dissertation in linguistics (1956).

She was not allowed to return to Moscow until 1964, following the first phase of Osip Mandelstam&#x27;s rehabilitation (under Nikita Khrushchev). She had spent 20 years in a kind of internal exile until the &quot;thaws&quot; of the late 1950s. Nadezhda began writing her memoir, which was published in English as &quot;Hope Against Hope&quot; in 1970, in part as a way of restoring her husband&#x27;s memory and integrating her own struggles. It first circulated in a &quot;samizdat&quot; version in the Soviet Union in the 1960s.

In her memoirs, &quot;Hope Against Hope&quot; (1970, 1977) and &quot;Hope Abandoned&quot; (1974, 1981), first published in the West, she made an epic analysis of her husband&#x27;s life and times. She elevated her husband as the figure of an artistic martyr under Stalin&#x27;s repressive regime. She criticized the moral and cultural degradation of the Soviet Union of the 1920s and later. The titles of her memoirs use word play as &quot;nadezhda&quot; means &quot;hope&quot; in Russian.

The third book remained unfinished. It contains Anna Akhmatova&#x27;s memoirs, which for 40 years were considered lost. They were published in German translation by Suhrkamp Verlag in 2011.

In his memoirs of meeting Nadezhda Mandelstam in 1975, retired University of Kent lecturer Edward Greenwood describes her as paranoid and worried, in fear of KGB surveillance. She lived in a small ground-floor apartment in Moscow and had not travelled abroad for more than 15 years. She had no communication with abroad either, as she told Greenwood that no mail was allowed to reach her from either inside Russia or outside it. In 1976, Mandelstam gave her archives to Princeton University in the United States.

In 1979, her heart condition deteriorated, and she took to her bed in early December 1980. Nadezhda Mandelstam died on 29 December 1980 in Moscow. The funeral was arranged in the Russian Orthodox rite, with the lying in state taking place on 1 January 1981, in the church of Our Lady of the Sign. She was buried on 2 January 1981, at the Kuntsevo Cemetery.

<doc id="901672" wikidata="Q957042" url="?curid=901672" title="Starkad">
<text>Starkad ( or ; Latin: Starcaterus; in the Late Middle Ages also Starkodder; modern Danish: Stærkodder) was either an eight-armed giant or the human grandson of the aforementioned giant in Norse mythology.

Starkad appears in numerous accounts, and the stories of his adventures relate to different Scandinavian traditions. He is most fully treated in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; but he also appears in Icelandic sources. He is portrayed as a great warrior who performed many heroic deeds but also many crimes.

A cognate of the Starkad legends can be found in the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==&quot;Beowulf&quot;==
In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the feud between the Danes and the Heaðobards was to be ended with the marriage of Ingeld, the son of the fallen Heaðobard king Froda, and Freawaru, the daughter of the Danish king Hroðgar. During the wedding an unnamed old warrior reminded the Heaðobards of their defeat and encouraged them to revenge. That is the origin of Starkad&#x27;s admonishing speech to the Danish king Ingellus, son of Frotho (see the account given in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; below). Sophus Bugge derived the name &quot;Starkaðr&quot; from originally meaning &quot;the strong Heaðobard&quot;. The first element is the Norse &quot;stark&quot;-.

==&quot;Hervarar saga&quot;==
A version of the legend of Starkad can be found in the prologue of the U-version of &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, and in a shortened form in the H-version of the Hauksbók.

In this version a Starkad Ala-Warrior lived in northern Norway at the waterfalls of Alufoss. He descended from the giants known as the &quot;þursar&quot; (jotuns), and his father&#x27;s name was Storkvid. Starkad was very much a jotun himself and had eight arms, but he was betrothed to a girl named Ogn Elf-burst. One day, when Starkad had gone north across the Élivágar, another giant named Hergrim kidnapped Ogn. Starkad challenged Hergrim to a holmgang, a duel. Starkad used four swords at the same time and slew Hergrim. Ogn did not wish to be Starkad&#x27;s wife and committed suicide by stabbing herself with a sword. Starkad contented himself by taking everything Hergrim owned, including his son Grimr.

Álfhildr was the daughter of king Álfr of Álfheim (modern Bohuslän) and like the people of Álfheim, she was very beautiful. One autumn, king Álfr performed the Dísablót, a sacrifice to the goddesses, and Álfhildr took part in it. As she was reddening the horgr (altar) with blood, Starkad kidnapped her. King Álfr called on the god Thor to help him rescue his daughter. Thor granted his wish by killing Starkad and rescuing the girl.

== &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; ==

&quot;Gautreks saga&quot; continues the account found in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;. It tells among other things the adventures of Starkad, the son of Stórvirkr who was the son of Starkad Ala-warrior, whom Thor had killed. 

It tells that young Starkad was raised at the court of Harald, the king of Agder, together with Harald&#x27;s son Vikar. One day, Herþjófr, the king of Hordaland, made a raid and killed king Harald. He also took Vikar hostage to ensure the loyalty of the people of Agder. When Vikar had grown up, he assembled a warband, including Starkad and avenged his father by killing Herþjófr with thirty of his warriors. Vikar was then king of Agder, Hordaland, and Hardanger.

Starkad took part in Víkar&#x27;s many battles for the hegemony of the petty kingdoms of southern Norway, one of the battles where Battle at Lake Vænir and he was Víkar&#x27;s greatest warrior.

After all these victories, when sailing north from Agdir to Hördaland with a large army, Víkar was becalmed. Divination showed Odin required a sacrifice of one person chosen by lot and Víkar&#x27;s lot came up each time. The decision was put off till the next day. Then Grani Horsehair, Starkad&#x27;s foster father, took Starkad to a secret council of the gods and revealed himself to be Odin. Odin bestowed on Starkad the blessings of living three lifetimes, of possessing the most excellent of weapons, an abundance of riches, victory in battle, the gift of poetry and always to be held in the highest esteem among the rich and powerful. Thor, however, who hated Starkad because of his jotun origin, denied Starkad the blessing of having children and cursed him to commit a crime every lifetime he lived and never to possess real estate. Thor further cursed Starkad never to feel that he had enough property, always to receive dangerous wounds in battle, never to remember his skaldic poems and ever to be hated by commoners. After blessings and curses laid on Starkad alternately by Odin and Thor, Odin asked Starkad to send him King Víkar in payment for Odin&#x27;s blessings. Starkad agreed and Odin gave Starkad a spear which Odin promised would appear to be only a reed-stalk. So Vikar met his death.

After Vikar&#x27;s death, Starkad fled to Sweden and the kings Alrek and Eirík at Uppsala. Starkad served them first as a companion on their viking expeditions and then, after Alrek and Eirík had settled down, he went on further Viking expeditions alone.

==Skaldic poetry==
Starkad is said to have composed poems himself which appear in &quot;Gautrek&#x27;s saga&quot;. Thor&#x27;s hate of Starkad because of his jotun origins is mentioned in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, where there is a &quot;lausavísa&quot; by Vetrliði Sumarliðason praising Thor for having killed giants and giantesses, and for having defeated Starkad:

However, it could also be a reference to Starkad&#x27;s grandfather, Starkad Ala-Warrior, whom Thor killed for having kidnapped Álfhildr, the princess of Alfheim.

==&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;==
In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson tells what happened a few generations after the deaths of Alrek and Eirík.

The Swedish king Aun was not a warlike king and had been chased away from his kingdom by Halfdan. When Halfdan had died, Aun returned to Uppsala to rule his old kingdom. After having sacrificed one of his sons to Odin, the god let him live for another sixty years. However, when twenty-five years had passed, a Danish prince named Áli the Bold appeared and chased Aun to exile in Götaland. Áli ruled for twenty-five years until Starkad appeared and killed him. Then Aun could return to his kingdom and ruled it for another period of twenty-five years.

==&quot;Sögubrot&quot;==

The &quot;Sögubrot&quot; deals with events taking place in the 8th century, a long time after Starkad killed Áli the Bold. 

When the Swedish king Sigurd Hring prepared for the Battle of the Brávellir against the Danish Harald Wartooth, a much later king Áli the Bold appeared with seven other kings to help him in the battle. These kings were accompanied by a great many champions, and among them Starkad the Old, the son of Stórverkr. Starkad would later compose a poem about this battle that would serve as a source for the sagas.

When the battle had begun, a formidable champion named Ubbi of Friesland charged against Ragnvald the Good Councilor the foremost champion in the wedge formation of king Sigurd. After a fierce fight, Ragnvald died and Ubbi pushed on killing champion after champion.

When king Sigurd Hring saw this he encouraged his warriors and said that it was not possible that no one could defeat Ubbi. He then asked &quot;where is Starkad?&quot;. The old warrior answered &quot;it is difficult to win sire. However, I will do my best and do what I can, but Ubbi is a tough fighter&quot;. Starkad engaged with Ubbi and a fight began that was long and the most fierce of the entire battle. Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that no one had been closer to kill him before. The two champions were separated by the pushing throng of warriors, and Ubbi finally fell riddled with arrows from the archers of Telemark.

The shieldmaiden Vebiorg took on the Swedish army. First she killed the champion Söti, but then Starkad attacked her. After giving Vebiorg a number of slashes, she cut his mouth so that his chin fell. Starkad had to bite his beard to keep his chin in place. She was killed by Thorkil the Bold.

Biting his beard and ignoring his wounds, Starkad charged the Danish army, killing man after man, until he met the shieldmaiden Ursina who carried the banner of king Harald Wartooth. She told him that he had met his last opponent, but he cut off the hand that held the banner and killed her. Starkad continued killing warrior after warrior, until he finally was so severely wounded that he had a large gash on his neck and a large gash on his chest that made his two lungs hang out. On his right hand, he had lost a finger.

The battle ended with Swedish victory.

==&quot;Norna-Gests þáttr&quot;==
In &quot;Norna-Gests þáttr&quot;, the account of Starkad takes place not long after the victory at the Battle of the Brávellir. The account deals with a meeting between Starkad and the hero Sigurd Dragonslayer. The old Norna-Gest told that during the time when he was with Sigurd Dragonslayer, the Swedish king Sigurd Hring demanded tribute from Sigurd and his people. When Sigurd refused, the king of Sweden sent an army to subdue him, led by the sons of Gandalf.

In the Swedish army, there was a man who was even bigger and stronger than the sons of Gandalf. The giant man killed both men and horses and nothing could defeat him. Sigurd and Gest approached the huge warrior and asked who he was. He answered that he was Starkad the son of Stórvirkr.

When Starkad learnt that Sigurd was the same Sigurd who had killed the dragon Fafnir, he tried to escape. However, Sigurd went after him and dealt a blow with his sword Gramr that ripped two teeth off Starkad&#x27;s mouth. Sigurd then asked Starkad to go home. When Starkad had left the battle, the sons of Gandalf retired as well, and so Sigurd had won the battle against the Swedes.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==

It is in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; that the most comprehensive treatment of Starkad is found. The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus wrote that Starkad was the son of Stórvirkr (Storwerk/Storuerkus) and saved himself from a shipwreck. He entered the service of the Danish king Frotho and was given a ship so that he could patrol the shores. 

No man was Starkad&#x27;s equal as he was endowed with a superhuman size and a noble disposition. Saxo Grammaticus gives two accounts of Starkad&#x27;s origin. According to one, he was born in the land of Estonians east of the Baltic Sea. According to the second, which the chronicler considers fantastic and unlikely, Starkad was born of jotuns, and he had formerly many arms until Thor cut off all arms but two. Odin had bestowed on Starkad the curse and the blessing that he would live the lives of three men, and commit three evil deeds.

His first evil deed was the murder of the Norwegian petty king Vikar (Wicarus). Starkad had joined a Viking expedition with Vikar, but they found themselves stopped by a strong wind. They then had the idea that they could appease the gods by performing a blót with human blood, and decided to cast lots as to whom was to be sacrificed. Starkad made a noose of willow and put it around the king&#x27;s neck in the pretense that it was only for show and not for killing. However, the knot was so strong that the king was dying, and Starkad gave him the coup de grace with his sword. Others say that the noose of willow suddenly became so strong that the king was strangled.

Starkad joined the Danish Viking Bemon (Bemonus) and they had a tough discipline on their crew, forbidding them alcoholic beverages. During an attack in Russia, they discovered that the Russians had riddled the terrain with caltrops to stop the Vikings. However, Starkad and his men donned clogs and so won the battle. When Bemon was dead, Starkad entered the service of the Bjarmians and did many heroic deeds among them. 

Later, Starkad stayed for seven years in Sweden at Uppsala, with the sons of Frey. However the effeminate jingle of bells, the dancing and the mimes at the sacrifices (see the Temple at Uppsala) nauseated Starkad.

He then enlisted with the Danish king Haki (Haco), and fought for him during the attack on king Hugleik (Hugletus) of Ireland. Hugleik wasted his riches on actors and jugglers, but was defended by Svipdag (Suibdagus) and Geigad (Gegathus), who gave Starkad the most vicious wound he had ever received. After winning the battle, Starkad had all the mimes and jugglers flogged, and all the riches looted.

Starkad was then sent with the Slavic prince Win (Winus) to quell a rebellion in the East. He fought against Curonians, Sambians, Semigallians, until all the Easterlings had been defeated. By covering his sword with a hide, he also defeated a warlord named Wisin (Wisinnus), who lived at Anafial in Russia, and who could make a weapon blunt only by looking at it. He continued his victories by killing the jotun Tanna in Byzantium and the Polish champion Wasce/Wilzce. (It is theorized that Polish writer Theodor Narbutt picked the name of the mountain and the villain (Anafial and Wisinnus) to embellish a legend about mount Anafielas, allegedly a place of the afterlife in Lithuanian pagan mythology).

When the Saxons rebelled against Frotho, and challenged him to a duel against Hama, Starkad unexpectedly returned and took Frotho&#x27;s place in the duel. Hama contemptuously brought Starkad to his knees with a blow by his fist, but Starkad rose up and cut Hama to death.

After a while Frotho was killed through treachery by a Saxon named Swerting (Swertingus). Frotho&#x27;s son Ingild (Ingellus) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting&#x27;s daughters. This angered Starkad so much that he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan&#x27;s (Haldanus) court instead. However, when he learnt that Helga, Ingild&#x27;s sister, was about to marry a lowly goldsmith, Starkad appeared in disguise and castrated the goldsmith. He gave Helga a slap on her face and lambasted her. Then he returned to Sweden and king Halfdan.

Ingild gave Helga to a Norwegian named Helgi (Helgo), on the condition that he fight nine brothers from Zealand who courted her, and among whom the eldest was named Angantyr (Angaterus). Helgi went to Sweden&#x27;s most famous city Uppsala and asked Starkad to help him in the fight. Starkad agreed, but left Helgi with his bride in order to fight with the nine brothers himself at the moor of Roliung. 

Starkad killed the nine brothers but had received seventeen wounds himself, and was so seriously wounded that his guts hung out. He refused the care of three lowly passers-by, but accepted the treatment of a peasant&#x27;s son, and could return to Sweden.

As Ingild continued his sinful life and did not do his duty to avenge his father, Starkad appeared during a banquet that Ingild had with the sons of Swerting, his father&#x27;s slayer. Starkad strongly admonished Ingild and humiliated his queen who tried to calm Starkad with kindness and her costly ribbon. Starkad succeeded in exciting Ingild to kill Swerting&#x27;s sons and to divorce his Saxon bride. 

During the Battle of the Brávellir between the Swedish king Sigurd Hring and Harald Wartooth (Haraldus Hyldetan), Starkad fought on the Swedish side. He received such a severe wound that his lung hung out, his skull was cleft and a finger was cut off. He had to leave the battle to tend to his wounds.

Starkad was accepted with honour in the warband of the Norwegian hero Olo. However, when Olo had succeeded in conquering Zealand, Starkad was convinced to join Lennius/Lenus/Lennus scheme to attack and kill Olo. However, Olo was hard to kill as his gaze scared everyone. It was not until Starkad managed to cover Olo&#x27;s face that he could kill him. Starkad was rewarded with 120 pounds in gold, but regretted his crime, and avenged Olo&#x27;s death by killing Lennius.

When Starkad was so old that he wished to die and his eyesight was bad, he hung his gold around his neck and went out to wander. He killed a man who wanted one of his swords and some riders who were contracted to kill Starkad by Hather (Hatherus), Lennius&#x27; son.

In front of Hather, Starkad sung about his accomplishments, and as Hather&#x27;s response showed Starkad that Hather was of noble birth, Starkad asked him to be his slayer. Starkad promised Hather all his gold and imperviousness, should Hather cut off his head and run between the head and the body as he fell. Hather cut off Starkad&#x27;s head but avoided running, as he feared being crushed by Starkad&#x27;s huge body. When the head had hit the ground, it bit a tussock of grass which showed how ferocious Starkad was.

Hather did not want the old warrior to lie unburied, but showed him respect by making a barrow for him on the heath of Roljung, at the same spot where Starkad&#x27;s heavy body long ago had made an imprint on a stone.

==Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus==

Olaus Magnus&#x27; cites the story of Starkad from Gesta Danorum. He disputes Saxo about origin of the hero and informs that Starkad was from the nation of Tavastians, &#x27;Starchaterum Thauestum&#x27;.

==Later traditions==
Later medieval traditions locate Starkad&#x27;s death and the heath of Roljung to Skåne. According to the &quot;Annales Ryenses&quot; (late 13th century), it was still possible to see Starkad&#x27;s sword in the water beneath the bridge of &quot;Boilyngh&quot; when the water was low. It is likely that &quot;Boilyngh&quot; is a misspelling of &quot;Roljung&quot;. Later this spot was located to Rönne river, and in the 16th century, people talked of the &quot;Stones of Starkkarl&quot; at Vegeholm. The Danish folklorist Axel Olrik and Arthur Stille recorded many recent traditions about Starkad in north-western Skåne. The Dano-Norweginan pastor and folklorist Magnus Landstad likewise noted that, although the tradition was mostly gone at his own time, the people of the upper Telemark remembered at least one story where Starkad was mentioned by name.

==Modern references==
The plot of the Science Fiction novel &quot;Ensign Flandry&quot; by the Danish American writer Poul Anderson takes place on a planet named &quot;Starkad&quot;. Anderson also included a short story about the meeting of Nornagest and Starkad in his book &quot;The Boat of a Million Years&quot;, in which both Nornagest and Starkad are part of a small group of humans who were born with an exceedingly rare genetic condition that makes them immortal.

The modern Danish name, &quot;Stærkodder&quot; has been used for an ironclad warship in the Royal Danish Navy.

In &quot;The Fionavar Tapestry&quot; trilogy by the Canadian author Guy Gavriel Kay, the fortress of Starkadh is the stronghold of the evil god Rakoth Maugrim.

In &quot;The Settlers (novel)&quot; by &quot;Vilhelm Moberg&quot;, the main protagonists names the first ox he buys after emigrating to North America Starkodder.

Starkad (or &quot;Starkadder&quot;) is the central figure in a trilogy of fantasy novels by the author Bernard King, which draw heavily from traditional Starkad stories and from other aspects of Norse myth and legend. The trilogy comprises the novels &quot;Starkadder&quot; (1985), &quot;Vargr-Moon&quot; (1986), and &quot;Death-Blinder&quot; (1988).

Starkad, as Starkaðr the Mighty, is mentioned in the 2018 videogame &quot;God of War&quot;, as a late Jotunn enshrined by the Jotnar people. Mimir relates how Thor killed him by ripping off six of his arms.

<doc id="901674" wikidata="Q11229656" url="?curid=901674" title="Landing Ship, Tank">
<text>A Landing Ship, Tank (LST) is a ship first developed during World War II (1939–1945) to support amphibious operations by carrying tanks, vehicles, cargo, and landing troops directly onto a low-slope beach with no docks or piers. The shallow draft and bow doors and ramps enabled amphibious assaults on almost any beach.

The LST had a highly specialized design that enabled ocean crossings as well as shore groundings. The bow had a large door that could open, deploy a ramp and unload vehicles. The LST had a flat keel that allowed the ship to be beached and stay upright. The twin propellers and rudders had protection from grounding. The LSTs served across the globe during World War II, including in the Pacific War and in the European theatre.

The first tank landing ships were built to British requirements by converting existing ships; the UK and the US then collaborated upon a joint design. The British ships were used in late 1942 during the Allied invasion of Algeria. In 1943, LSTs participated in the invasion of Sicily and mainland Italy. In June 1944 they were part of the huge invasion fleet for the Normandy landings.

Over 1,000 LSTs were laid down in the United States during World War II for use by the Allies; the United Kingdom and Canada produced eighty more.

==LST Mk.1==


===&quot;Maracaibo&quot; landing ships===
The British evacuation from Dunkirk in 1940 demonstrated to the Admiralty that the Allies needed relatively large, ocean-going ships that could handle shore-to-shore delivery of tanks and other vehicles in amphibious assaults upon the continent of Europe. As an interim measure, three 4,000 to 4,800-gross register ton &quot;Lake tankers&quot;, built to pass over the restrictive bars of Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, were selected for conversion because of their shallow draft. Bow doors and ramps were added to these ships, which became the first tank landing ships, LST (1): , and . They later proved their worth during the invasion of Algeria in 1942, but their bluff bows made for inadequate speed and pointed out the need for an all-new design incorporating a sleeker hull.

=== &quot;Boxer&quot; class ===
The &quot;Boxer&quot; class was the first purpose-built LST design. This work was started before any of the converted &quot;Maracaibo&quot; class were in service, so there was no opportunity to learn from the effectiveness of that design. The urgency in building the Boxers was that the Maracaibos were considered to be too slow for operational requirements. As events turned out, the LST(2) had the same slow speed of , but given the much larger numbers of the LST(2), that had to be accepted.

The Boxer class was a scaled-down design from ideas penned by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In order that it could carry 13 Churchill infantry tanks, 27 other vehicles and nearly 200 men (in addition to the crew) at a speed of , it could not have a shallow draught sufficient for easy unloading. As a result, each of the three (, , and ) ordered in March 1941 had a very long ramp stowed behind the bow doors.

The ships were built at Harland and Wolff from 1941 and the first completed early in 1943. Work was delayed by the complexities of an entirely new type of design and German air raids on Belfast. &quot;Bruiser&quot; and &quot;Thruster&quot; took part in the Salerno landings. Later all three were intended to be converted to fighter direction ships in order to have ground-controlled interception of enemy aircraft during landing operations but only &quot;Boxer&quot; was converted and it took part in the Normandy landings.

The U.S. were to build seven LST (1) but in light of the problems with the design and progress with the LST Mark II the plans were cancelled. Construction of the LST (1)s took until 1943 and the first US LST (2) was launched before them.

==LST Mk.2==
===Development===
At their first meeting at the Atlantic Conference in Argentia, Newfoundland, in August 1941, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill confirmed the Admiralty&#x27;s views. In November 1941, a small delegation from the Admiralty arrived in the United States to pool ideas with the United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships with regard to development of ships and the possibility of building further &quot;Boxer&quot;s in the US. During this meeting, it was decided that the Bureau of Ships would design these vessels. As with the standing agreement, these ships would be built by the US so British shipyards could concentrate on building vessels for the Royal Navy. The specifications called for vessels capable of crossing the Atlantic, and the original title given to them was &quot;Atlantic Tank Landing Craft&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Atlantic (T.L.C.)&quot;. Calling a vessel long a &quot;craft&quot; was considered a misnomer and the type was re-named &quot;Landing Ship, Tank (2)&quot;, or &quot;LST (2)&quot;.

The LST (2) design incorporated elements of the first British LCTs from their designer, Sir Rowland Baker, who was part of the British delegation. One of the elements provided for sufficient buoyancy in the ships&#x27; sidewalls so that they would float the ship even when the tank deck was flooded. The LST (2) gave up the speed of HMS &quot;Boxer&quot;, at only , but carried a similar load while drawing only forward when beaching.

===Design===
Within a few days, John C. Niedermair of the Bureau of Ships sketched out an awkward looking ship that proved to be the basic design for the more than 1,000 &quot;LST (2)&quot; that were built during World War II. To meet the conflicting requirements of deep draft for ocean travel and shallow draft for beaching, the ship was designed with a large ballast system that could be filled for ocean passage and pumped out for beaching operations. An anchor and mechanical winch system also aided in the ship&#x27;s ability to pull itself off the beach. The rough sketch was sent to Britain on 5 November 1941 and accepted immediately. The Admiralty then requested that the United States build 200 &quot;LST (2)&quot; for the Royal Navy under the terms of lend-lease.

The preliminary plans initially called for an LST 280 feet (85 m) in length; but, in January 1942, the Bureau of Ships discarded these drawings for a slightly longer ship of . Within a month, final working plans were developed that further stretched the overall length to with a beam and a minimum draft of . This scheme distributed the ship&#x27;s weight over a greater area, enabling her to ride higher in the water when in landing trim. The LST could carry a load of tanks and vehicles. The larger dimensions also permitted the designers to increase the width of the bow door opening and ramp from in order for it to be able to accommodate most Allied vehicles. As the dimensions and weight of the LST increased, steel plating thickness increased from to on the deck and sides, with plating under the bow. By January 1942, the first scale model of the LST had been built and was undergoing tests at the David Taylor Model Basin in Washington, D.C.

Provisions were made for the satisfactory ventilation of the tank space while the tank motors were running, and an elevator was provided to lower vehicles from the main deck to the tank deck for disembarking. In April 1942 a mock-up of the well-deck of an LST was constructed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, to resolve the problem of ventilation within the LST well-deck. The interior of the building was constructed to duplicate all the features found within an actual LST. Being the home to the Armored Force Board, Fort Knox supplied tanks to run on the inside while Naval architects developed a ventilation system capable of evacuating the well-deck of harmful gases. Testing was completed in three months. This historic building remains at Fort Knox today.

Early LST operations required overcoming the 18th-century language of the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy: &quot;He who doth suffer his ships to founder on rocks and shoals shall be punished...&quot; There were some tense moments of concept testing at Quonset, Rhode Island, in early 1943 when designer Niedermair encouraged the commanding officer of the first U.S. LST to drive his ship onto the beach at full speed of .

===Production===


The LST(2) was built as the LST-1&quot; class and the LST-491&quot; class.

In three separate acts dated 6 February 1942, 26 May 1943, and 17 December 1943, Congress provided the authority for the construction of LSTs along with a host of other auxiliaries, destroyer escorts, and assorted landing craft. The enormous building program quickly gathered momentum. Such a high priority was assigned to the construction of LSTs that the previously laid keel of an aircraft carrier was hastily removed to make room for several LSTs to be built in her place. The keel of the first LST was laid down on 10 June 1942 at Newport News, Virginia, and the first standardized LSTs were floated out of their building dock in October. Twenty-three were in commission by the end of 1942.

The LST building program was unique in several respects. As soon as the basic design had been developed, contracts were let and construction was commenced in quantity before the completion of a test vessel. Preliminary orders were rushed out verbally or by telegrams, telephone, and air mail letters. The ordering of certain materials actually preceded the completion of design work. While many heavy equipment items, such as main propulsion machinery, were furnished directly by the Navy, the balance of the procurement was handled centrally by the Material Coordinating Agency—an adjunct of the Bureau of Ships—so that the numerous builders in the program would not have to bid against one another. Through vigorous follow-up action on materials ordered, the agency made possible the completion of construction schedules in record time.

The need for LSTs was urgent, and the program enjoyed a high priority throughout the war. Since most shipbuilding activities were located in coastal yards that were mainly used for construction of large, deep-draft ships, new construction facilities for the LSTs were established along inland waterways, some converted from heavy-industry plants, such as steel fabrication yards. Shifting the vessels was complicated by bridges across waterways, many of which were modified by the Navy to permit passage. A dedicated Navy &quot;Ferry Command&quot; orchestrated the transportation of newly constructed ships to coastal ports for final fitting out. Of the 1,051 LSTs built during the war, 670 were supplied by five &quot;cornfield shipyards&quot; in the Midwest. Dravo Corporation&#x27;s facility at Neville Island, Pennsylvania, designated the lead shipyard for the project, built 145 vessels and developed fabrication techniques that reduced construction time and costs at all of the LST shipyards. The Missouri Valley Bridge &amp; Iron Co. built the most LSTs of any shipyard, with 171 constructed at Evansville, Indiana. Chicago Bridge and Iron&#x27;s shipyard in Seneca, Illinois, launched 156 ships and was specifically chosen because of their reputation and skills, particularly in welding. The American Bridge Company in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, built 119.

===Modifications===
By 1943, the construction time for an LST had been reduced to four months. By the end of the war, this had been cut to two months. Considerable effort was expended to hold the ship&#x27;s design constant, but, by mid-1943, operating experience led to the incorporation of certain changes in the new ships.

From LST-513, the elevator to transfer equipment between the tank deck and the main deck was replaced with a ramp that was hinged at the main deck. This allowed vehicles to be driven directly from the main deck down to the tank deck and then across the bow ramp to the beach or causeway, speeding the process of disembarkation.

Changes in the later &quot;LST-542&quot; class included the addition of a navigation bridge; the installation of a water distillation plant with a capacity of per day; the removal of the tank deck ventilator tubes from the center section of the main deck; the strengthening of the main deck in order to carry a smaller Landing Craft Tank (LCT); and an upgrade in armor and armament, with the addition of a 3&quot;/50 caliber gun.

==LST Mk.3==
===Design===
The LST (2) design was successful and production extensive, but there was still a need for more LSTs for British operations. As such, it was decided to build a further 80 of the ships in the UK and Canada to be available in the spring of 1945.

The British Staff drew up their own specification, requiring that the ship:

* Be able to embark and disembark tanks, motor transport, etc., on beaches of varying slopes; and amphibians and DD Sherman tanks into deep water
* Carry five Landing Craft Assault (LCA), or similar craft, and one LCT (5) or LCT (6) on the upper deck, in place of transport, and, as an alternative to the LCT (5), two NL pontoon causeway to be carried; the LCT (5) and NL pontoon causeways to be capable of launching directly from the upper deck.
* To carry 500 tons of military load and to beach with that and sufficient fuel and stores for a return journey at , on draughts forward and aft.
* To carry a load of sixty tons over the main ramp and ten tons over the vehicle ramp (i.e., the ramp from the upper deck to the bow door. After trials, this was removed from some vessels)
* To be fitted for operations in the tropics and in cold climates

Two major problems made a redesign necessary. The preferred light weight medium-speed (locomotive type) Electro-Motive Diesel 12-567 diesel engines were not immediately available. Staff wanted more power and higher speeds if possible, which the EMD engines could have provided. However, the only engines available were very heavy steam reciprocating engines from frigates that had been cancelled. These delivered two and a half times the power of the diesels. So large were they that significant changes had to be made to accommodate them. Lack of welded construction facilities meant that the hull had to be riveted. This combination of heavy hull and heavy engines meant that speed was only faster than the LCT (2).

At the same time, other improvements were made—as well as simplifications required so most of the structure could be assembled with rivets. The cutaway hard chine that had been dropped in the American version of the Mark 2 vessels was restored. The tank deck, which was above the waterline, was made parallel to the keel, there was to be no round down to the upper deck, and the ship was enlarged to accommodate the more bulky machinery.

Provision was made for carrying the British Landing Craft Assault (LCA) in gravity davits, instead of American assault craft. Provision was also made for carrying Landing Craft Tank (LCT) and Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM), and NL pontoon causeways.

When the design commenced, engineers knew that the beaches where the ships were expected to land would be very flat, but it was not possible to produce a satisfactory vessel with a draught forward, and very little keel slope, so the 1 in 50 keel slope was maintained. It was known that the 1:50 slope would often result in the LST grounding aft on a shallow beach, resulting in the vehicles being discharged into comparatively deep water.

Various methods had been investigated to overcome the problem, but heavy grounding skegs and the N.L. pontoon causeways were finally accepted as standard; the pontoon causeways were formed of pontoons × 5 ft × , made up into strings and rafts. When offloading, the rafts were secured to the fore end of the ship, and the load discharged directly onto the shore, or towed on the raft to the shore.

The ships were fitted out for service in both very cold and tropical conditions. The accommodation provided for both crew and army personnel was greatly improved compared with LST (2). The main hazard, apart from enemy action, was fire on the tank deck. Fire sprinklers were provided, but the water drenching system installed in later American vessels could not be provided.

The bow door arrangements were similar to the LST (2), but the design arranged the bow ramp in two parts in an attempt to increase the number of beaches where direct discharge would be possible. The machinery for operating the bow doors and ramp were electrical, but otherwise, steam auxiliaries replaced the electrical gear on the LST (2).

The general arrangements of the tank deck were similar, but the design increased headroom and added a ramp to the top deck, as in later LST (2)s. Provision was made for carrying LCA on gravity davits instead of the American built assault boats. The arrangements were generally an improvement over the LST (2), but suffered from a deeper draught, and, to some extent, from the haste of construction.

The first orders were placed in December 1943 with British builders, and 35 with Canadian builders. Swan Hunter delivered the first ships in December 1944. During 1944, follow up orders were placed in Canada for a further 36. These programmes were in full swing when the war ended, but not all vessels were completed.

The ships were numbered numbers &quot;LST-3001&quot; to &quot;LST-3045&quot; and &quot;LST-3501&quot; to &quot;LST-3534&quot;. &quot;LST−3535&quot; and later were cancelled.

Fifteen 40-ton tanks or 27 25-ton tanks could be carried on the tank deck with an additional fourteen lorries on the weather deck.

===Propulsion===
Steam was supplied by a pair of Admiralty pattern 3-drum water-tube type boilers, working at . The main engines were of the 4-cylinder triple expansion 4-crank type, balanced on the Yarrow-Tweedy-Slick system, the cylinders being as follows:

The common stroke was . The piston and slide valve rods were all fitted with metallic packing to the stuffing boxes, and all pistons fitted with packing rings and springs. The high-pressure valve was of the piston type, whilst the remaining ones were of the balanced type. The main engines were designed to develop at 185 rpm continuously.

With the ships being twin screw, the engines were fitted with a shaft coupling to the crank shaft at the forward end, allowing the engine to be turned end to end to suit either port or starboard side fitting.

===Modifications for landing craft===
When the LST (3)s were ordered, the LST (2) programme was in full swing, and similar arrangements were made to enable the LSTs to carry the long LCT5 or LCT6 that were being built in America for the Royal Navy.

The LCT needed lifting onto the deck of the ship, being carried on wedge-shaped support blocks; at the time of launching she was set down on the &quot;launch ways&quot; by simply slacking off bolts in the wedge blocks, allowing the launch way to take the weight. To carry out a launch, the LST was heeled over about 11 degrees by careful flooding of tanks in the hull. The height of the drop was about . Once launched in this way, the propeller shafts were reconnected (together with some minor &quot;unpacking&quot; work) and the LCT was ready for operation.

This method was used for moving LCT5s from Britain to the Far East, although there seems to be no reference to LST (3)s being used, most being completed late in or after the war.

Even at the end of the war there was a need for more ships able to carry minor landing craft, and two of the LST (3)s then completing were specially fitted to carry LCM (7). These craft, which were long and weighed about 28 tons, were carried transversely on the upper deck of the ship. They were hoisted on by means of a specially fitted 30-ton derrick; This 30-ton derrick replaced a 15-ton derrick, two of which were the standard fit of the LST (3). The 30-ton derrick was taller and generally more substantial than the 15 ton one.

The LCM (7)s were landed on trolleys fitted with hydraulic jacks. These ran on rails down each side of the deck, and were hauled to and fro by means of winches. The stowage was filled from fore to aft as each craft was jacked down onto fixed cradles between the rails. The ships completed to this standard were &quot;LST-3043&quot;/HMS &quot;Messina&quot;, and &quot;LST-3044&quot;/HMS &quot;Narvik&quot;. While these ships were able to carry LCMs, they were only able to carry out loading and unloading operations under nearly ideal weather conditions, and therefore could not be used for assault operations; they also lacked the facilities to maintain the landing craft (which the Dock Landing Ships provided).

The Landing Craft Assault were wooden-hulled vessels plated with armour, long overall, wide, and displacing 13 tons fully loaded. Draught was , and normal load was 35 troops with of equipment. A pair of Scripps marine conversions of Ford V8 engines gave it speeds of unloaded, service speed, on one engine. Range was miles on . Armament was typically a Bren light machine gun aft; with two Lewis Guns in a port forward position.

The LCM (7)s that were carried on the LST (2) were considerably larger, in length, beam, with a hoisting weight of 28 tons, full load displacement of 63 tons. Beaching draught was , and propulsion was provided by a pair of Hudson Invader petrol engines, later replaced with Grays diesels, both sets providing , giving a speed of .

The main requirement of the design was to carry a 40-ton Churchill tank or bulldozer at . 140 had been completed when the war ended, and some saw service through to the 1970s.

===Variants===
Some LST (3)s were converted to LST (A) (A for &quot;assault&quot;) by adding stiffening so they could safely carry the heaviest British tanks.

Two LST (3)s were converted to command vessels, LST (C): LST 3043 and LST 3044. Post war they became HMS &quot;Messina&quot; (L112) and HMS &quot;Narvik&quot; (L114). They were better armed with ten 20 mm Oerlikons and four 40 mm Bofors.

Two LST (3)s were converted during building into Headquarters command ships LST (Q). These were L3012, which became L3101 (and later HMS &quot;Ben Nevis&quot;) and LST 3013, which became LST 3102, and then HMS &quot;Ben Lomond&quot;. They acted as LST &quot;mother ships&quot;, similar in most aspects to American ships based on the LST (2) hull. They had two Quonset huts erected on the main deck to accommodate 40 officers. Berths on the tank deck berthed an extra 196 men. A bake shop and 16 refrigeration boxes for fresh provisions augmented the facilities normally provided for the crew. Four extra distilling units were added, and the ballast tanks were converted for the storage of fresh water.

==Service in World War II==
At the Armor Training School in Ft. Knox, Kentucky, buildings were erected as exact mock-ups of an LST. Tank crews in training learned how to maneuver their vehicles onto, in and from an LST with these facilities. One of these buildings has been preserved at Ft. Knox for historic reasons and can still be seen.

From their combat début in the Solomon Islands in June 1943 until the end of the hostilities in August 1945, the LSTs performed a vital service in World War II. They participated in the invasions of Sicily (Operation Husky), Italy, Normandy, and southern France in the European Theater and were an essential element in the island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific that culminated in the liberation of the Philippines and the capture of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

Despite the large numbers produced, LSTs were a scarce commodity and Churchill describes the difficulty in retaining sufficient LSTs in the Mediterranean for amphibious work in Italy, and later the logistics of moving large numbers to the eastern theatres, while still supplying the large armies in Europe.

The LST proved to be a remarkably versatile ship. Thirty-nine of them were converted to become landing craft repair ships (ARL). In this design, the bow ramp and doors were removed, and the bow was sealed. Derricks, booms, and winches were added to haul damaged landing craft on board for repairs, and blacksmith, machine, and electrical workshops were provided on the main deck and tank deck.

Thirty-six LSTs were converted to serve as small hospital ships and designated LSTH. They supplemented the many standard LSTs, which removed casualties from the beach after landing tanks and vehicles. LSTs had brought 41,035 wounded men back across the English Channel from Normandy by D-Day+114 (28 September 1944). Other LSTs, provided with extra cranes and handling gear, were used exclusively for replenishing ammunition. They possessed a special advantage in this role, as their size permitted two or three LSTs to go simultaneously alongside an anchored battleship or cruiser to accomplish replenishment more rapidly than standard ammunition ships.

Three LST (2) were converted into British &quot;Fighter Direction Tenders&quot; (FDT), swapping their landing craft for Motor Launches and outfitted with AMES Type 11 and Type 15 fighter control radar to provide Ground-controlled interception (GCI) coverage for air defence of the D-Day landing areas. Of these ships, HMS &quot;FDT 216&quot; was stationed off Omaha and Utah beaches, HMS &quot;FDT 217&quot; was allocated Sword, Juno, and Gold beaches. HMS &quot;FDT 13&quot; was used for coverage of the overall main shipping channel. In the period 6 June to 26 June Allied fighters controlled by the FDTs resulted in the destruction of 52 enemy aircraft by day, and 24 enemy aircraft by night.

=== LST flight decks ===
In the latter stages of World War II, some LSTs were fitted with flight decks that could launch small observation planes during amphibious operations. These were USS &quot;LST-16&quot;, USS &quot;LST-337&quot;, USS &quot;LST-386&quot;, USS &quot;LST-525&quot;, &quot;LST-776&quot;, and . Two others (USS &quot;LST-393&quot; and USS &quot;LST-776&quot;) were fitted with the Brodie System for take off and landing.

It has been estimated that, in the combined fleets assembled for the war on Japan, the tonnage of landing ships, excluding landing craft, would have exceeded five million tons and nearly all built within four years.

Throughout the war, LSTs demonstrated a remarkable capacity to absorb punishment and survive. Despite the sobriquets &quot;Large Slow Target&quot; and &quot;Large Stationary Target&quot;, which were applied to them by crew members, the LSTs suffered few losses in proportion to their number and the scope of their operations. Their brilliantly conceived structural arrangement provided unusual strength and buoyancy; was struck and holed in a post-war collision with a Victory ship and survived. Although the LST was considered a valuable target by the enemy, only 26 were lost due to enemy action, and a mere 13 were the victims of weather, reef, or accident.

A total of 1,152 LSTs were contracted for in the great naval building program of World War II, but 101 were cancelled in the fall of 1942 because of shifting construction priorities. Of 1,051 actually constructed, 113 LSTs were transferred to Britain under the terms of Lend-Lease, and four more were turned over to the Greek Navy. Conversions to other ship types with different hull designations accounted for 116: 6 Miscellaneous Ships (AG), 14 Motor Torpedo Boat Tenders (AGP), 7 Self-Propelled Barracks Ships (APB), 13 Battle Damage Repair Ships (ARB), 39 Landing Craft Repair Ships (ARL), 3 Salvage Craft Tenders (ARST), 4 Aircraft Repair Ships (ARVA, ARVE), 1 Advance Aviation Base Ship (AVB), 4 Unclassified miscellaneous vessels (IX), and 36 LSTH. One LST which had been sunk in an accident was later raised and converted into a Covered Barge (YF).

==Post-war developments==

===United States===
The end of World War II left the Navy with a huge inventory of amphibious ships. Hundreds of these were scrapped or sunk, and most of the remaining ships were put in &quot;mothballs&quot; to be preserved for the future. Additionally, many of the LSTs were demilitarized and sold to the private sector, along with thousands of other transport ships, contributing to a major downturn in shipbuilding in the United States following the war. Many LSTs were used as targets in aquatic nuclear testing after the war, being readily available and serving no apparent military applications. World War II era LSTs have become somewhat ubiquitous, and have found a number of novel commercial uses, including operating as small freighters, ferries, and dredges. Consequently, construction of LSTs in the immediate post-war years was modest. &quot;LST-1153&quot; and &quot;LST-1154&quot;, commissioned respectively in 1947 and 1949, were the only steam-driven LSTs ever built by the Navy. They provided improved berthing arrangements and a greater cargo capacity than their predecessors.

The success of the amphibious assault at Inchon during the Korean War showed the utility of LSTs once again. This was in contrast with the earlier opinion expressed by many military authorities that the advent of the atomic bomb had relegated amphibious landings to a thing of the past. During the Korean War a number of LSTs were converted to transport the much needed, but slow and short range LSU from the United States to the Korean theater of war using the piggy-back method. After arrival the LSU was slid off sideways from the LST. Additionally, LSTs were used for transport in the building of an Air Force base at Thule, Greenland during the Korean War. Fifteen LSTs of what were later to be known as the &quot;Terrebonne Parish&quot; class were constructed in the early 1950s. These new LSTs were longer and were equipped with four, rather than two, diesel engines, which increased their speed to . Three-inch / 50-caliber twin mounts replaced the old twin 40 mm guns, and controllable pitch propellers improved the ship&#x27;s backing power. On 1 July 1955, county or, in the case of Louisiana, parish names were assigned to many LSTs, which up to then had borne only a letter-number hull designation.

In the late 1950s, seven LSTs of the &quot;De Soto County&quot; class were constructed. These were an improved version over earlier LSTs, with a high degree of habitability for the crew and embarked troops. Considered the &quot;ultimate&quot; design attainable with the traditional LST bow door configuration, they were capable of .

==== Commercial ferry use ====

In 1946, a brand new concept of transport was developed in the UK. During World War II, the great potential of landing ships and craft was recognised; if it was possible to drive tanks, guns and lorries directly onto a beach, then theoretically the same landing craft could be used to carry out a similar operation in the civilian commercial market, providing there were reasonable port facilities. From this idea grew the worldwide roll-on/roll-off ferry industry. In the period between the world wars, Lt. Colonel Frank Bustard formed the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company, with a view to cheap transatlantic travel. This never materialised, but he observed trials on Brighton Sands of a LST in 1943 when its peacetime capabilities were obvious.

In the spring of 1946, the company approached the Admiralty with a request to purchase three of these vessels. The Admiralty was unwilling to sell, but after negotiations agreed to let the ASN have the use of three vessels on bareboat charter at a rate of £13 6s 8d per day. These vessels were LSTs &quot;3519&quot;, &quot;3534&quot;, and &quot;3512&quot;. They were renamed &quot;Empire Baltic&quot;, , and , perpetuating the name of White Star Line ships in combination with the &quot;Empire&quot; ship naming of vessels in government service during the war.

The chartered vessels had to be adapted for their new role. First the accommodation on board had to be improved, and alterations in the engine and boiler rooms had also to be made. Modified funnels and navigational aids needed to be provided before they could enter service. On the morning of 11 September 1946, the first voyage of the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company took place when &quot;Empire Baltic&quot; sailed from Tilbury to Rotterdam with a full load of 64 vehicles for the Dutch government. On arrival at Waalhaven, the vessel beached using the method employed during wartime landings, being held by a stern anchor. The vessel stayed on the beach overnight, returning at 08:00 the next morning. This leisurely pace of work was followed for the first few voyages, the beach being employed possibly because normal port facilities were unavailable due to wartime damage. Following the initial Rotterdam voyage, ASN used their new vessels to transfer thousands of vehicles for the British Army from Tilbury to Hamburg, and later to Antwerp in 1955.

The original three LSTs were joined in 1948 by another vessel, , renamed &quot;Empire Doric&quot;, after the ASN were able to convince commercial operators to support the new route between Preston Dock in Lancashire and the Northern Ireland port of Larne. Originally Liverpool was chosen, but opposition from other operators led to a move to Lancashire. However, special port facilities had to be constructed at both Preston and Larne before the new route could be opened – a wartime end-loading ramp built by engineers during World War II at Preston, and a floating pontoon from a Mulberry harbour connected via a bridge to the quay at Larne.

The first sailing of this new route was on 21 May 1948 by &quot;Empire Cedric&quot;. After the inaugural sailing, &quot;Empire Cedric&quot; continued on the Northern Ireland service, offering initially a twice-weekly service. &quot;Empire Cedric &quot; was the first vessel of the ASN fleet to hold a Passenger Certificate, and was allowed to carry fifty passengers. Thus &quot;Empire Cedric&quot; became the first vessel in the world to operate as a commercial/passenger roll-on/roll-off ferry, and the ASN became the first company to offer this type of service.

Some of the first cargo on this service were two lorry-loads of 65 gas cookers each on behalf of Moffats of Blackburn, believed to be the first commercial vehicles carried in this way as freight. The Preston–Larne service continued to expand, so much so that in 1950 it added a route to Belfast. This service opened in 1950, and sailings out of Preston were soon increased to six or seven a week to either Belfast or Larne.

In 1954, the British Transport Commission (BTC) took over the ASN under the Labour government&#x27;s nationalization policy. In 1955, another two LSTs were chartered into the existing fleet, and , bringing the fleet strength to seven. The Hamburg service was terminated in 1955, and a new service was opened between Antwerp and Tilbury. The fleet of seven ships was to be split up, with the usual three ships based at Tilbury and the others maintaining the Preston to Northern Ireland service.

During late 1956, the entire fleet of ASN was taken over for use in the Mediterranean during the Suez Crisis, and the drive on/drive off services were not re-established until January 1957. At this point ASN were made responsible for the management of twelve Admiralty LST (3)s brought out of reserve as a result of the Suez Crisis, though too late to see service.

==== Army service ====

A major task at the end of World War II was the redistribution of stores and equipment worldwide. Due to the scarcity and expense of merchant shipping it was decided in 1946 that the Royal Army Service Corps civilian fleet should take over seven LSTs from the Royal Navy. These were named after distinguished corps officers: Evan Gibb, Charles Macleod, Maxwell Brander, Snowden Smith, Humfrey Gale, Reginald Kerr, and Fredrick Glover.

The LSTs needed to comply with Board of Trade regulations, and to be brought up to merchant navy standards, which involved lengthy alterations including extra accommodation. On completion, five vessels sailed for the Middle East, and two for the Far East.

During the evacuation of Mandatory Palestine, &quot;Humfrey Gale &quot;and &quot;Evan Gibb &quot;made fifteen voyages each between Haifa and Port Said lifting between them 26,000 tons of vehicles and stores.

Similar work was done worldwide until 1952 when the ships were handed over to the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company, and subsequently in 1961 to the British-India Steam Navigation Company, tasked by the War Office directly, RASC having no further concern with their administration.

==== Aviation training ====

The rapid increase in the use of helicopters in the Royal Navy in the late 1950s and 1960s required an increase in the training and support facilities ashore and afloat. Operational training for aircrew was carried out by naval air stations at Portland and Culdrose. The scrapping of some carriers and conversion of others to commando carriers in the mid-1950s left a shortage of suitable decks. This led to the ordering of in 1964; however, she would not be available till 1967. In the meantime it was decided to convert &quot;LST 3027&quot; to serve as an interim training ship.

This work was carried out at Devonport Dockyard in 1964. The deck forward of the cargo hatch was cleared of all obstructions, and strengthened for helicopter use. A small deckhouse used to support the gun emplacements was retained, although no guns were fitted, and it was used by the Flight Deck Officer as a helicopter control position. Below deck, two aviation fuel tanks were installed at the fore end of the tank deck, and refuelling positions provided at the fore end of the flight deck. The tanks were sealed off by a bulkhead and the rest of the space used for stores, workshops and accommodation. Finally the bow doors were sealed, as they would no longer be needed. The flight deck was large enough for two Westland Wessex helicopters with rotors turning, or six could be parked with rotors folded. Renamed she proved extremely useful in service, and many lessons were learned that would be incorporated into &quot;Engadine&quot;.

==Modern developments==
The commissioning of the in 1969 marked the introduction of an entirely new concept in the design of LSTs. She was the first of a new class of 20 LSTs capable of steaming at a sustained speed of . To obtain that speed, the traditional blunt bow doors of the LST were replaced by a pointed ship bow. Unloading is accomplished through the use of a ramp operated over the bow (similar in concept to the original HMS &quot;Boxer&quot;) and supported by twin derrick arms. A stern gate to the tank deck permits unloading of LVTs into the water or the unloading of other vehicles into a landing craft utility (LCU) or onto a pier. Capable of operating with high-speed amphibious squadrons consisting of LHAs, LPDs, and LSDs, the &quot;Newport&quot;-class LST can transport tanks, other heavy vehicles, and engineering equipment that cannot readily be landed by helicopters or landing craft. The &quot;Newport&quot; type were removed from U.S. Navy service in the 1990s, and Spanish Navy, Chile, Australia, and Malaysia but serves on in the navies of Brazil, Mexico, Morocco, Taiwan, in a modified form and soon with Peru.

Elsewhere, over 100 Polish s were produced from 1967 to 2002. The Indian Navy maintains a fleet of seven Polnocny-class LSTs and LCUs known collectively as the .

===Literature===

&quot;Lucky&quot;, a 2017 movie about an 90 year old atheist coming to terms with his own mortality. In one scene, Lucky encounters a fellow World War II veteran and reflects on his service in the US Navy during the Pacific campaign. He reveals that he earned his nickname thanks to his relatively safe position as a cook on an LST — a vessel humorously dubbed a &quot;Large Slow Target&quot; by the crew.

&quot;Jonah&#x27;s Cathedral&quot; by R. D. Wall, is a novel of the Vietnam War based on the author&#x27;s experiences while serving on an LST in the Mekong Delta in 1966. The book, #1 in the Jonah Wynchester Series, follows the exploits of U.S. Navy Gunner&#x27;s Mate Jonah Wynchester from the time he reports aboard his new assignment, the LST USS &quot;Winchester County&quot;, at the Navy Amphibious Base in Little Creek, Virginia, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1966 through the time the ship departs for Vietnam. The &quot;Cathedral&quot; refers to the nickname the crew have given the ship, a decrepit, run-down LST in the ready reserve fleet, that is suddenly re-activated and fully manned for the rapidly expanding need for LSTs in the Vietnam theater. Book #2, &quot;Mekong Covenant&quot; follows the ship across the Pacific into the deadly brown waters of the Mekong Delta.

&quot;The Ninety and Nine&quot; by William Brinkley, author of &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot;, portrays an LST running supplies to Anzio during World War II. The title refers to the ship&#x27;s company of ninety enlisted men and nine officers. The book opens with a quotation attributed to Winston Churchill – &quot;The destinies of two great empires ... seemed to be tied by some god-damned things called LST&#x27;s.&quot;

In the biography &quot;Man In Motion: Michigan&#x27;s Legendary Senate Majority Leader, Emil Lockwood&quot; by Stanley C. Fedewa and Marilyn H. Fedewa, Lockwood colorfully describes his World War II service aboard &quot;LST-478&quot;. &quot;We were always in the thick of it,&quot; Emil said, &quot;because it was our job on the LSTs to carry personnel-operated tanks, artillery, supplies—anything, you name it—into the heart of a war zone.&quot;

The novel &quot;Warm Bodies&quot; by Donald R. Morris portrays life on an LST in the 1950s. The title refers to the use of any available body in port during overhaul for any duty necessary. &quot;A Warm Body is man with at least one arm and two fingers who can pick up something when he is told to.&quot; Although a work of fiction, the novel is based on Morris&#x27; experience as an officer aboard an LST.

<text>Project Excelsior was a series of parachute jumps made by Joseph Kittinger of the United States Air Force in 1959 and 1960 from helium balloons in the stratosphere. The purpose was to test the Beaupre multi-stage parachute system intended to be used by pilots ejecting from high altitude. In one of these jumps Kittinger set world records for the longest parachute drogue fall, the highest parachute jump, and the fastest speed by a human through the atmosphere. He held the latter two of these records for 52 years, until they were broken by Felix Baumgartner of the Red Bull Stratos project in 2012, though he still holds the world record for longest time in free fall.

==Background==
As jet planes flew higher and faster in the 1950s, the Air Force became increasingly worried about the safety of flight crews who had to eject at high altitude. Tests in Operation High Dive with dummies had shown that a body in free-fall at high altitude would often go into a flat spin at a rate of up to 200 revolutions per minute (about 3.3 revolutions per second). This would be potentially fatal.

Project Excelsior was initiated in 1958 to design a parachute system that would allow a safe, controlled descent after a high-altitude ejection. Francis Beaupre, a technician at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, devised a multi-stage parachute system to facilitate human tests. This consisted of a small diameter stabilizer or &quot;drogue&quot; parachute, designed to prevent uncontrolled spinning at high altitudes, and a diameter main parachute that deployed at a lower altitude. The system included timers and altitude sensors that would automatically deploy both parachutes at the correct points in the descent, even if the parachutist were unconscious or disabled.

To test the parachute system, staff at Wright Field built a high helium balloon with a capacity of nearly that could lift an open gondola and test pilot into the stratosphere. Captain Joseph Kittinger, who was test director for the project, made three ascents and test jumps. As the gondola was unpressurized, Kittinger wore a modified David Clark MC-3A partial pressure suit during these tests, plus additional layers of clothing to protect him from the extreme cold at high altitude. Together with the parachute system, this almost doubled his weight.

==Test jumps==
The first test, Excelsior I, was made on November 16, 1959. Kittinger ascended in the gondola and jumped from an altitude of . In this first test, the stabilizer parachute was deployed too soon, catching Kittinger around the neck and causing him to spin at 120 revolutions per minute. This caused Kittinger to lose consciousness, but his life was saved by his main parachute which opened automatically at a height of .

Despite this near-disaster on the first test, Kittinger went ahead with another test only three weeks later. The second test, Excelsior II, was made on December 11, 1959. This time, Kittinger jumped from an altitude of and descended in free-fall for before opening his main parachute.

The third and final test, Excelsior III, was made on August 16, 1960. During the ascent, the pressure seal in Kittinger&#x27;s right glove failed, and he began to experience severe pain in his right hand from the exposure of his hand to the extreme low pressure. (See Space exposure.) He decided not to inform the ground crew about this, in case they should decide to abort the test. Despite temporarily losing the use of his right hand, he continued with the ascent, climbing to an altitude of . The ascent took one hour and 31 minutes and broke the previous crewed balloon altitude record of , which was set by Major David Simons as part of Project Manhigh in 1957. Kittinger stayed at peak altitude for 12 minutes, waiting for the balloon to drift over the landing target area. He then stepped out of the gondola to begin his descent.

The small stabilizer parachute deployed successfully and Kittinger fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, setting a long-standing world record for the longest free-fall. During the descent, Kittinger experienced temperatures as low as . In the free-fall stage, he reached a top speed of . For context, a free-falling average human body moves at a velocity of 240–290 km/h. At an altitude of , Kittinger opened his main parachute and landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The whole descent took 13 minutes and 45 seconds and set a world record for the highest parachute jump.

A plaque attached below the open door of the Excelsior III gondola read, &quot;This is the highest step in the world&quot;.

Kittinger held the world records for highest parachute jump and highest speed of a human in atmosphere until October 14, 2012 when Felix Baumgartner jumped from and reaching a speed of 377.12 m/s as part of the Red Bull Stratos project, with Kittinger serving as a technical advisor to Baumgartner. Kittinger does, however, still hold the records for longest drogue fall and longest freefall.

==Response==
Kittinger&#x27;s efforts during Project Excelsior proved that it was possible for an air crew to descend safely after ejecting at high altitudes. President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded Kittinger the C. B. Harmon Trophy for his work on Excelsior. Kittinger also received an oak leaf cluster to the Distinguished Flying Cross, the J.J. Jeffries Award, the A. Leo Stevens Parachute Medal, and the Wingfoot Lighter-Than-Air Society Achievement Award.

<text>Blindness (, meaning &quot;Essay on Blindness&quot;) is a 1995 novel by the Portuguese author José Saramago. It is one of Saramago&#x27;s most famous novels, along with &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus Christ&quot; and &quot;Baltasar and Blimunda&quot;. In 1998, Saramago received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and &quot;Blindness&quot; was one of his works noted by the committee when announcing the award.

A sequel titled &quot;Seeing&quot; was published in 2004. &quot;Blindness&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name in 2008.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Blindness&quot; is the story of an unexplained mass epidemic of blindness afflicting nearly everyone in an unnamed city, and the social breakdown that swiftly follows. The novel follows the misfortune of a handful of unnamed characters who are among the first to be stricken with blindness, including an ophthalmologist, several of his patients, and assorted others, who are thrown together by chance. The ophthalmologist&#x27;s spouse, &quot;the doctor&#x27;s wife,&quot; is inexplicably immune to the blindness. After a lengthy and traumatic quarantine in an asylum, the group bands together in a family-like unit to survive by their wits and by the good fortune that the doctor&#x27;s wife has escaped the blindness. The sudden onset and unexplained origin and nature of the blindness cause widespread panic, and the social order rapidly unravels as the government attempts to contain the apparent contagion and keep order via increasingly repressive and inept measures.

The first part of the novel follows the experiences of the central characters in the filthy, overcrowded asylum where they and other blind people have been quarantined. Hygiene, living conditions, and morale degrade horrifically in a very short period, mirroring the society outside. 

Anxiety over the availability of food, caused by delivery irregularities, acts to undermine solidarity; and lack of organization prevents the internees from fairly distributing food or chores. Soldiers assigned to guard the asylum and look after the well-being of the internees become increasingly antipathetic as one soldier after another becomes infected. The military refuses to allow basic medicine to be delivered, which ensures that a simple infection becomes deadly. Fearing an imminent escape, soldiers shoot down a crowd of internees waiting for a food delivery. 

Conditions degenerate further as an armed clique gains control over food deliveries, subjugating their fellow internees and exposing them to violent assault, rape, and deprivation. Faced with starvation, internees battle each other and burn down the asylum, only to discover that the army has abandoned the asylum, after which the protagonists join the throngs of nearly helpless blind people outside who wander the devastated city and fight one another to survive.

The story then follows the doctor&#x27;s wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” as they attempt to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). At this point, the breakdown of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find one another. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor&#x27;s house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.

== Characters ==

=== The doctor&#x27;s wife===

The doctor&#x27;s wife is the only character in the novel who does not lose her sight. This phenomenon remains unexplained through the novel. Unwilling to leave her husband to be interned, she lies to the government doctors and claims to be blind. As such, she is interned with the rest of the afflicted. Once inside, she attempts to help the compound organize, but she is increasingly unable to hold back the animality of the compound. When one ward begins withholding food and demanding that the women of other wards submit to being raped in return for food, she kills the leader of their ward. Once they escape the compound, she helps her group survive in the city. The doctor&#x27;s wife is the de facto leader of their small group, although in the end, she often serves their disabled needs and acts as a nurse to them.

=== The doctor===

The doctor is an ophthalmologist stricken blind after treating a patient with what will come to be called &quot;the white sickness&quot;. The doctor is among the first to be quarantined along with his wife. Due to his medical expertise he has a certain authority among those quarantined. However, much of the doctor&#x27;s authority stems from his wife not having gone blind; she is able to see what is going on around the ward and relays what she sees to her husband. When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife&#x27;s apartment. Several of the other main characters had been visiting the doctor&#x27;s office when the epidemic begins to spread.

=== The girl with the dark glasses ===

The girl with the dark glasses is a former part-time prostitute who is struck blind while she is with a customer. She seemingly contracted the “white-blindness” while visiting the doctor due to conjunctivitis (hence the dark glasses). She is unceremoniously removed from the hotel and taken to be quarantined in the asylum. Once inside, she joins the small group of people who were contaminated at the doctor&#x27;s office. When the car thief gropes her on the way to the lavatory, she kicks him with a heeled shoe – giving him a wound which will eventually lead to his death. While inside, she also takes care of the boy with the squint, whose mother is nowhere to be found. At the end of the story, she and the old man with the black eye patch become lovers.

=== The old man with the black eye patch ===

The old man with the black eye patch is the last person to join the first ward. He brings with him a portable transistor radio that allows the internees to listen to the news. He is also the main architect of the failed attack on the ward of hoodlums hoarding the food rations. Once the group escapes the quarantine, the old man becomes the lover of the girl with the dark glasses.

=== The dog of tears ===

The dog of tears is a dog that joins the small group of blind people when they leave the quarantine. While he is mostly loyal to the doctor&#x27;s wife, he helps the whole group by protecting them all from packs of dogs who are becoming increasingly feral. He is called the dog of tears because he bonded to the group when he licked the tears off the face of the doctor&#x27;s wife.

=== The boy with the squint ===

The boy with the squint was a patient of the doctor&#x27;s, which is most likely how he became infected. He is brought to the quarantine without his mother and soon falls in with the group in the first ward. The girl with the dark glasses assumes a motherly role for him, as she takes care of him and ensures his safety. 

=== The car thief ===

After the first blind man was struck blind in traffic, a car thief brought him home then stole his car. Soon after he went blind, the car thief and the first blind man re-encounter one another in the quarantine, where they soon come to blows. They have no time to resolve their conflict, though, since the car thief is the first internee killed by the guards. He is gunned down while trying to ask the guards for medication for his infected leg.

=== The first blind man ===

The first man to go blind is struck blind in the middle of traffic, waiting at a stoplight. He is immediately taken home and then to the doctor&#x27;s office, where he infects all of the other patients and the doctor. He is one of the principal members of the first ward - the ward with all of the original internees. When the epidemic is finally over, he is the first person to regain his sight.

=== The first blind man&#x27;s wife ===

The wife of the first blind man goes blind soon after helping her husband to the quarantine. They are reunited by chance in the quarantine. Once inside, she also joins the first ward with the doctor and the doctor&#x27;s wife. When the ward of hoodlums begins to demand that the women sleep with them in order to be fed, the first blind man&#x27;s wife volunteers to go, in solidarity with the others.

=== The man with the gun ===

The man with the gun is the leader of the ward of hoodlums that seizes control of the food supply in the quarantine. He and his ward take the rations by force and threaten to shoot anyone who doesn&#x27;t comply with their orders. This ward extorts valuables from the other internees in exchange for food and, when the &quot;goods&quot; (such as bracelets and watches) run out they begin to rape the women. He is later stabbed to death by the doctor&#x27;s wife.

=== The blind accountant ===

This man is not one of those afflicted by the &quot;white sickness&quot;—rather he has been blind since birth. He is the only one in the ward who can read and write braille and who knows how to use a walking stick. Additionally, he is the second in command to the man with the gun in the ward of hoodlums. When the doctor&#x27;s wife kills the man with the gun, the blind accountant takes the gun and tries to seize control but he is unable to rally support. He dies when one of the rape victims sets fire to the ward.

==Style==
Like most works by Saramago, &quot;Blindness&quot; contains many long, breathless passages in which commas take the place of periods, quotation marks, semicolons, and colons. The lack of quotation marks around dialogue means that the speakers&#x27; identities (or the fact that dialogue is occurring) may not be immediately apparent to the reader. The lack of proper character names in &quot;Blindness&quot; is typical of many of Saramago&#x27;s novels (e.g. &quot;All the Names&quot;). The characters are instead referred to by descriptive appellations such as &quot;the doctor&#x27;s wife&quot;, &quot;the car thief&quot;, or &quot;the first blind man&quot;. Given the characters&#x27; blindness, some of their names seem ironic (&quot;the boy with the squint&quot; or &quot;the girl with the dark glasses&quot;).

The city afflicted by the blindness is never named, nor the country specified. Few definite identifiers of culture are given, which contributes an element of timelessness and universality to the novel. However, there are some signs that hint that the country is Saramago&#x27;s homeland of Portugal: the main character is shown eating chouriço, a spicy sausage, and some dialogue in the original Portuguese employs the familiar &quot;tu&quot; second-person singular verb form (a distinction absent in most of Brazil). The church, with all its saintly images, is likely of the Catholic variety.

==Sequel==
Saramago wrote a sequel to &quot;Blindness&quot; in 2004, titled &quot;Seeing&quot; (&quot;Ensaio sobre a lucidez&quot;, literal English translation &quot;Essay on lucidity&quot;), which has also been translated into English. The sequel novel takes place in the same country featured in &quot;Blindness&quot; and features several of the same nameless characters. 

==Adaptations==
An English-language film adaptation of &quot;Blindness&quot; was directed by Fernando Meirelles. Filming began in July 2007 and stars Mark Ruffalo as the doctor and Julianne Moore as the doctor&#x27;s wife. The film opened the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2007 the Drama Desk Award Winning Godlight Theatre Company staged the New York City theatrical premiere of Blindness at 59E59 Theaters. This stage version was adapted and directed by Joe Tantalo. The First Blind Man was played by Mike Roche.

An outdoor performance adaptation by the Polish group Teatr KTO, was first presented in June 2010. It has since been performed at a number of venues, including the Old College Quad of the University of Edinburgh during the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Shortly before his death, Saramago gave German composer Anno Schreier the rights to compose an opera based on the novel. The libretto is written in German by Kerstin Maria Pöhler. Like the German translation of the novel, the opera&#x27;s title is &quot;Die Stadt der Blinden&quot;. It saw its first performance on November 12, 2011 at the Zurich Opera House.

In August 2020, the Donmar Warehouse produced a socially-distanced sound installation based on the novel. &quot;BLINDNESS&quot; was adapted by Simon Stephens and directed by Walter Meierjohann. Juliet Stevenson voiced the Doctor&#x27;s Wife.

<text>The Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV)—official designation AAVP-7A1 (formerly known as Landing Vehicle, Tracked, Personnel-7 abbr. LVTP-7)—is a fully tracked amphibious landing vehicle manufactured by U.S. Combat Systems (previously by United Defense, a former division of FMC Corporation).

The AAV-P7/A1 is the current amphibious troop transport of the United States Marine Corps. It is used by U.S. Marine Corps Amphibious Assault Battalions to land the surface assault elements of the landing force and their equipment in a single lift from assault shipping during amphibious operations to inland objectives and to conduct mechanized operations and related combat support in subsequent mechanized operations ashore. It is also operated by other forces. Marines call them &quot;amtracs&quot;, a shortening of their original designation, &quot;amphibious tractor&quot;.

In June 2018, the Marine Corps announced they had selected the BAE Systems/Iveco wheeled SuperAV for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) program to supplement and ultimately replace the AAV.

==History==
===Development===
The U.S. Marine Corps became interested in replacing the LVTP-5 due to its limited range, slow water speed and the difficulty of maintaining the aging platform. In 1964, the Marine Corps solicited proposals to replace meet its requirement. The Marine Corps selected a proposal by FMC. FMC delivered the first of 15 prototypes, designated LVTPX12, in October 1967. Marine Corps testing concluded in September 1969. In June 1970, the Marine Corps awarded FMC a $78.5 million contract for the production of 942 vehicles.

The LVTP-7 was first introduced in 1972. In 1982, FMC was contracted to conduct the LVTP-7 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which converted the LVT-7 vehicles to the improved AAV-7A1 vehicle by adding an improved engine, transmission, and weapons system and improving the overall maintainability of the vehicle. The Cummins VT400 diesel engine replaced the GM 8V53T, and this was driven through FMC&#x27;s HS-400-3A1 transmission. The hydraulic traverse and elevation of the weapon station was replaced by electric motors, which eliminated the danger from hydraulic fluid fires. The suspension and shock absorbers were strengthened as well. The fuel tank was made safer, and a fuel-burning smoke generator system was added. Eight smoke grenade launchers were also placed around the armament station. The headlight clusters were housed in a square recess instead of the earlier round type. The driver was provided with an improved instrument panel and a night vision device, and a new ventilation system was installed. These upgraded vehicles were originally called LVT-7A1, but the Marine Corps renamed the LVTP-7A1 to AAV-7A1 in 1984.

Another improvement was added starting in 1987 in the form of a Cadillac Gage weapon station or Up-Gunned Weapon Station (UGWS) which was armed with both a .50 cal (12.7 mm) M2HB machine gun and a Mk-19 40 mm grenade launcher.

Enhanced Applique Armor Kits (EAAK) were developed for the AAV-7A1 in 1989 and fitted by 1993, and the added weight of the new armor necessitated the addition of a bow plane kit when operating afloat.

The Assault Amphibious Vehicle Reliability, Availability, Maintainability/Rebuild to Standard (AAV RAM/RS) Program was approved in 1997. It encompassed all AAV systems and components to return the AAV to the original vehicle&#x27;s performance specifications and ensure acceptable readiness until the EFV should become operational. The program replaced both the AAV engine and suspension with US Army M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) components modified for the AAV. Ground clearance returned to and the horsepower to ton ratio increased from 13 to 1 to its original 17 to 1. The introduction of the BFV components and the rebuild to standard effort was expected to reduce maintenance costs for the expected remaining life of the AAV through the year 2013.

In March 2015, SAIC was awarded a contract to perform an AAV Survivability Upgrade (SU). Marine Corps and SAIC officials unveiled the AAV SU prototype in January 2016, with survivability enhancements including replacing the angled EAAK with 49 advanced buoyant ceramic armor panels, a bonded spall liner, armor-protected external fuel tanks, an aluminum armor underbelly providing Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)-equivalent blast protection, and blast mitigating seats as well as a more powerful engine, new suspension system, and increased reserve buoyancy. The AAV SU program was intended to upgrade 392 out of the some 1,000-vehicle fleet to keep them operational through 2035 as the ACV gradually entered service. However, in August 2018 the Marine Corps terminated the AAV upgrade program, instead opting for increased procurement of the ACV.

In 2021, the United States Marine Corps started to install the M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) on their AAVP-7A1s. The M153 CROWS is a stabilized mount that contains a sensor suite and fire control software. It allows on-the-move target acquisition and first-burst target engagement. Capable of target engagement under day and night conditions, the CROWS sensor suite includes a daytime video camera, thermal camera and laser rangefinder. It can be fitted with the Mk-19 grenade launcher, M2 .50 Caliber Machine Gun, or M240B Medium Machine Gun.

===Service history===

Twenty U.S.-built LVTP-7s were used by Argentina during the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands with most returning to the Argentine mainland before the war ended.

From 1982 to 1984, LVTP-7s were deployed with U.S. Marines as part of the multi-national peacekeeping force in Beirut, Lebanon. As Marines became increasingly involved in hostilities, several vehicles sustained minor damage from shrapnel and small arms fire.

On October 25, 1983 U.S. Marine LVTP-7s conducted a highly successful amphibious landing on the island of Grenada as part of Operation Urgent Fury.

It was heavily used in the 1991 Gulf War and Operation Restore Hope.

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, AAV-7A1s were criticized for providing poor protection for the crew and passengers compared with other vehicles, such as the M2 Bradley. Eight were disabled or destroyed during the Battle of Nasiriyah, where they faced RPG, mortar, tank and artillery fire. At least one vehicle was destroyed by fire from friendly A-10 Warthog aircraft.

On 3 August 2005, 14 U.S. Marines and their Iraqi interpreter were killed when their AAV struck a roadside bomb in the city of Haditha in the Euphrates river valley in western Iraq.

During the 2010 Rio de Janeiro security crisis, the Brazilian Naval Fusiliers used AAV-7A1s in support of their operations to occupy the Complexo da Penha and Complexo do Alemão favelas, where the vehicles were used to clear barricades left by the Red Command.

Eight U.S. Marines and one U.S. Navy sailor died on 30 July 2020, when their AAV sank in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Clemente Island, California, during a training exercise, ahead of an upcoming deployment. As a result of the incident, on 15 December 2021 the U.S. Marine Corps announced that it has banned its fleet of amphibious armored personnel carriers from maritime operations except in emergencies.

===Replacement attempts===
====Cancelled: Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle====
Renamed from the Advanced Assault Amphibious Vehicle in late 2003, the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) was designed to replace the aging AAV. Able to transport a full Marine rifle squad to shore from an amphibious assault ship beyond the horizon with three times the speed in water and about twice the armor of the AAV, and superior firepower as well it was the Marine Corps&#x27; number one priority ground weapon system acquisition. The EFV was intended for deployment in 2015. However, in January 2011, United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced plans to cancel the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. In 2012, the USMC dropped the EFV and cancelled the program.

====Replacement: Amphibious Combat Vehicle====
In June 2018, the Marine Corps announced they had selected the BAE Systems/Iveco wheeled SuperAV for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) program to supplement and ultimately replace the AAV.

==Variants==

* LVTP-7: Original series introduced from 1972. Originally armed with a M85 12.7 mm (.50cal) machine gun.
* LVTP-7A1: 1982 upgraded. Renamed to AAVP-7A1 from 1984.
** AAVP-7A1 (Personnel): This is the most common AAV, as it carries a turret equipped with an M2HB 12.7 mm (.50 caliber) heavy machine gun, and a Mk19 40 mm automatic grenade launcher. It carries four crew radios as well as the AN/VIC-2 intercom system. It is capable of carrying 21 combat equipped Marines in addition to the crew of 4: driver, crew chief/vehicle commander, gunner, and rear crewman.
** AAVC-7A1 (Command): This vehicle does not have a turret, and much of the cargo space of the vehicle is occupied by communications equipment. This version only has two crew radios, and in addition to the VIC-2, it also carries two VRC-92s, a VRC-89, a PRC-103 UHF radio, a MRC-83 HF radio and the MSQ internetworking system used to control the various radios. This AAV has a crew of 3, and additionally carries 5 radio operators, 3 staff members, and 2 commanding officers. Recently, the C7 has been upgraded to use Harris Falcon II class radios, specifically the PRC-117 for VHF/UHF/SATCOM, and the PRC-150 for HF.
** AAVR-7A1 (Recovery): This vehicle also does not have a turret. The R7 is considered the &quot;wrecker&quot;, as it has a crane as well as most tools and equipment needed for field repairs. It is by far the heaviest of the three, and sits considerably lower in the water. Crew of three, plus the repairmen.

Many P7s have been modified to carry the Mk 154 MCLC, or Mine Clearance Line Charge. The MCLC kit can fire three linear demolition charges to breach a lane through a minefield. MCLCs were used in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and again in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.

In the 1970s, the U.S. Army used an LVTP-7 as the basis for their Mobile Test Unit (MTU), a ground-based high-energy anti-aircraft laser. After several successful test firings at Redstone Army Arsenal, the laser was reportedly transferred to NASA.
* KAAV7A1: KAAV7A1 amphibious vehicle series based on AAV-7A1 by Samsung Techwin (now Hanwha Defense) and BAE systems developed and manufactured in South Korea by Samsung Techwin.

==Training systems==
The Office of Naval Research (ONR) under the Virtual Training and Environments (VIRTE) program, led by then LCDR Dylan Schmorrow, developed a prototype training system called the AAV Turret Trainer. The system consists of an actual surplus turret mounted with ISMT (Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainer) weapons firing on a projected screen displaying the VIRTE Virtual Environment. A total of 15 systems were produced for the USMC and one system for Taiwan.

<text>Béla Károlyi (; September 13, 1942 – November 15, 2024) was a Romanian and American gymnastics coach of Hungarian origin. Early in his coaching career he developed the Romanian centralized training system for gymnastics. One of his earliest protégés was Nadia Comăneci, the first Olympic Games gymnast to be awarded a perfect score. Living under the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu, Károlyi frequently clashed with Romanian officials. He and his wife defected to the United States in 1981.

After their arrival in the United States, Béla and his wife Márta Károlyi were credited with transforming the coaching of gymnastics in the U.S. and bringing major international success. They were each a coach for the United States women&#x27;s national gymnastics team, as well as national team coordinators for United States gymnastics at the Olympic Games. They have been severely criticized for their coaching style, which many gymnasts have called abusive. They claim to have been unaware that Larry Nassar, the national gymnastics team doctor who was convicted of sexual assault of minors, was assaulting young female gymnasts in their care at their Karolyi Ranch training facility in the Sam Houston National Forest in Texas. &quot;Athlete A&quot;, a documentary about the scandal, is a 2020 film which covers the Karolyis and their ranch.

Károlyi coached many notable national, European, Olympic gymnasts as well as those from the World Gymnastics Championships including Nadia Comăneci, Ecaterina Szabo, Mary Lou Retton, Julianne McNamara, Betty Okino, Teodora Ungureanu, Kim Zmeskal, Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, Phoebe Mills, and Kerri Strug. He coached nine Olympic champions, fifteen world champions, sixteen European medalists, and six U.S. national champions. He was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997. Béla and Márta Károlyi as a coaching team were inducted into the US Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Early life, family and education==

Károlyi was born in Kolozsvár, Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania). Skilled as an athlete, he became a national junior boxing champion and a member of the Romanian hammer throwing team. He enrolled at the Romania College of Physical Education, studying and practicing gymnastics after having had trouble with a mandatory skills test in the sport.

==Early coaching career==
During his senior year at the college, Károlyi coached the women&#x27;s gymnastics team, whose star was Márta Erőss. They later started a relationship and married in 1963. They moved to a small town in the coal-mining region where Béla had grown up, where they started a gymnastics class at the town&#x27;s elementary school. Later the government invited them to create a national school for gymnastics.

Romania&#x27;s famed centralized training program has its roots in the 1950s; Bela Károlyi helped develop the program further in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He worked as a coach at the boarding school in Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (now named Oneşti), training young girls specially chosen for their athletic potential. One of the first students at the school was six-year-old Nadia Comăneci, who lived near the town and commuted from home.

Károlyi debuted as an international coach in 1974. He had to persuade the Romanian gymnastics federation to have Comăneci and his other athletes named to the 1975 European Championships and the 1976 Olympic team, because the federation favored athletes from the competing Dinamo club in Bucharest. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, he was the head coach of the Romanian squad; most of the members of the team were Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej athletes. The team earned the silver medal. Comăneci was one of the outstanding performers of the Games, scoring the first-ever perfect 10 in Olympic competition. Altogether, they won seven medals in Montreal: three gold, two silver, and two bronze. After Comăneci&#x27;s astounding success in Montreal, Károlyi&#x27;s importance as a coach was recognized. He was named head coach of the Romanian team at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, USSR. 

==1980s==
Romanian Federation officials criticized Károlyi because of his score protests at several international meets, including the 1980 Olympics. After the 1980 Olympics, Károlyi clashed with Romanian Federation officials, and tension escalated. During a 1981 gymnastics tour, Romanian team choreographer Géza Pozsár and the Károlyis defected and sought political asylum in the US, temporarily leaving their seven-year-old daughter Andrea with relatives in Romania. They settled in Texas.

In 1981, a group of businessmen invited Károlyi to join a gymnastics business venture. He agreed to invest, and the Károlyis moved to Houston. When the gym ran into financial problems, Károlyi bought it.

Károlyi&#x27;s status as &quot;Nadia&#x27;s coach&quot; quickly attracted gymnasts to his club. Three years after his defection, he attended the 1984 Olympics as the individual coach of Mary Lou Retton, who won all-around champion and Julianne McNamara, who won the gold medal for uneven bars. Olympic rules at the time did not permit a gymnast&#x27;s personal coach to be present on the competition floor. Only the national coach Don Peters and his assistant were allowed on the floor. Károlyi obtained a maintenance man&#x27;s pass so he could be near Retton and McNamara during the competition. ABC television network commented on this controversy during its broadcasts and often showed Retton and McNamara running over to the stands to speak to Károlyi. During the 1984 Olympics, Károlyi did not have an official position with the delegation. He slept in his car, and ignored Peters&#x27; instructions by holding supplementary workouts for his gymnasts. Károlyi&#x27;s clout in the United States increased after the victories of his students in 1984, but so did resentment against him. After Retton&#x27;s success in 1984, Károlyi purchased the Karolyi Ranch. He was paid by McDonald&#x27;s to have their golden arch logo as part of his sleeve design on his outfit. His new gym, run from the ranch, attracted many of the country&#x27;s top gymnasts.

After the 1984 Olympics, USGF decided to replace Peters with Greg Marsden as Olympic coach. Marsden was a college coach with no private students and no financial interest in promoting one gymnast at the expense of another. Marsden said that he &quot;thought some of the concerns the other coaches had about Károlyi were legitimate;&quot; Marsden picked Donna Cozzo as his assistant national coach. Károlyi was furious and had to be dissuaded from boycotting the 1987 Pan American Games. He did not attend the meet, complaining that he was not allowed to coach although he was &quot;providing fifty percent of the team&quot;. Károlyi&#x27;s star gymnast Kristie Phillips competed in the meet finishing second behind Sabrina Mar, who trained with former Olympic coach Don Peters at SCATS gym in Huntington Beach, California.

The United States did not do well in the 1987 World Championships, finishing 6th. After Marsden resigned from his position as national team coach in November 1987, Károlyi lobbied to be appointed national coach, but he was opposed by the other coaches. Don Peters was restored to the position in January 1988. Peters chose Béla&#x27;s wife Márta Károlyi to serve as assistant national coach. Béla Károlyi told the United States Gymnastics Federation that he would not attend the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games unless he was the team coach.

At the 1988 Olympic Trials in August, Károlyi&#x27;s gymnasts earned 5 of the top 8 spots. The five gymnasts were Phoebe Mills, Brandy Johnson, Chelle Stack, and the two team alternates Rhonda Faehn and Kristie Phillips. Phillips, who had left Károlyi&#x27;s gym and trained with Peters for a short time following her disappointing performance at the 1987 World Championships, said that Peters″ workouts were &quot;not half as intense (as Károlyi&#x27;s)&quot;. Phillips told reporters it would hurt the national team if they had to leave Károlyi&#x27;s gym and train with Peters at SCATS. USGF executive director Mike Jacki said, &quot;The women&#x27;s coaches are all private businessmen... The more kids you put on the team, the better it is for your business.&quot;

Peters resigned as national coach after the trials. After Peters&#x27; resignation, the USGF decided against having a national team coach and allowed personal coaches to accompany the gymnasts to competitions. The U.S. Olympic team finished fourth in Seoul. East German gymnastic official Ellen Berger raised a valid objection, since a U.S. team member had violated one of the obscure competition rules. After the springboard had been used at the start of another gymnast&#x27;s uneven bars routine, the U.S. alternate, Rhonda Faehn, had pulled it away but had stayed on the podium to watch, instead of stepping off again immediately, as required by the rule. Had Faehn stepped off the podium, the US team would have won the bronze medal. Because of this small points deduction, the East German team overtook the American team and won the bronze medal. An incensed Karolyi said the rule was invoked in order to &quot;keep the scores down&quot; because the East German team was &quot;fighting desperately to keep their place&quot;. The obscure rule goes on to say that no assistance can be given during a performance. It did not specifically mention athletes on the podium. A jury dominated by Soviet Bloc officials voted to maintain the deduction. Despite the fact that the U.S. team had indeed committed an infraction, he said that application of the scoring penalty was &quot;dirty cheating&quot;. A photograph of Karolyi embracing and consoling the disappointed American girls appeared in most U.S. newspapers the following day.

After the 1988 Olympics, Károlyi&#x27;s sphere of influence continued to grow as did the number of elite gymnasts training in his gym. At one meet in 1990, a journalist dubbed six top Károlyi gymnasts the &quot;Karolyi six-pack.&quot; Although the members of the six-pack would change, the name stuck and increased Károlyi&#x27;s prominence in the sport.

==1990s==
At the 1991 World Championships, four of the six athletes on the U.S. women&#x27;s team—Kim Zmeskal, Betty Okino, Hilary Grivich, and Kerri Strug—were trained by Károlyi; the other two (alternates) Shannon Miller and Michelle Campi, were trained by ex-Károlyi club coaches. The situation was nearly repeated at the 1992 Olympics, where Károlyi was head coach and five members of the seven-gymnast squad (six competitors and one alternate) were either trained by him or one of his protégés.

Károlyi primarily was a personal coach for Dominique Moceanu and Kerri Strug at the 1996 Olympics, but he still managed to draw the spotlight. After Strug injured her ankle on her first vault Károlyi encouraged her, &quot;Shake it off! You can do it!&quot;. After Strug&#x27;s successful final vault, Károlyi carried the injured Strug to the podium to accept her gold medal. The moment was photographed and one of the most memorable from the Olympics.

Károlyi retired from coaching after the 1996 Olympics. He and Márta went to their ranch and gymnastics camp in New Waverly, Texas. In 1997, Bela was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

== 1999–2000 ==
After the success of the U.S. team, dubbed the &quot;Magnificent Seven,&quot; at the 1996 Olympics, USA Gymnastics experienced a lull. A new requirement that competitors be at least 16 years old in the calendar year of the competition (up from the previous 15) kept some top gymnasts out of the World Championships in 1997. While American gymnasts did win medals in international competitions such as the Goodwill Games and the Pacific Alliance Championships, they were largely unsuccessful in most major meets. In both 1997 and 1999, the American team left the World Championships without a single medal.

After the 1999 World Championships, USA Gymnastics tried to revamp its program by hiring Károlyi as national team coordinator. Károlyi required that all national team members attend frequent, grueling camps at his ranch north of Houston. Some observers believed that selection procedures for international meets became more arbitrary. Coaches resented what they felt was Károlyi&#x27;s intrusion onto their domain, and athletes were under a considerable amount of stress. The tension escalated to the point where gymnasts were openly speaking out against Károlyi. At the 2000 Olympics, the US team originally placed fourth, but the Chinese team had an underage athlete, so the US team was ultimately awarded the bronze in 2010.

In 2001, Marta Károlyi was selected for the national team coordinator position. While she retained some aspects of her husband&#x27;s program, such as the training camp system, she reduced the frequency of the camps. Her different approach met with more acceptance by both coaches and gymnasts. Between 2001 and 2007, American women won a combined total of 34 medals in World Championship and Olympic competition. Between 2001 and 2016, they won five World Championships team titles (2003, 2007, 2011, 2014, and 2015) and two Olympic team titles (2012, 2016). Additionally, the team won four consecutive Olympic all-arounds (2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016), eight World Championships all-arounds (2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017), and eighteen individual event World Championships titles.

==Later career==
Márta Károlyi remained the national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics until 2016. During the 2008 Summer Olympics, Béla Károlyi appeared as a guest commentator for NBC News. He claimed that the Chinese women&#x27;s gymnastics team was cheating by using athletes who did not meet the minimum age requirement. He and his wife said, &quot;They are using half-people. One of the biggest frustrations is, what arrogance. These people think we are stupid.&quot; Károlyi said that he disagreed with the age limit. He called for it to be abolished by the International Olympic Committee. He said that if a gymnast was good enough to earn a spot at the Olympics or World Championships, he or she deserves to go. He objected to the possibility that they were being used by their government. &quot;They do good gymnastics and are a good service for the sport,&quot; he said. &quot;They have the ultimate effective training program. That’s why I am more upset that they are cheating. They don’t need cheating. They would be just as good with a lineup of eligible athletes.&quot;

==Controversy==
Several of Károlyi&#x27;s athletes from the &quot;six-pack&quot; era have criticized his training methods. Some of his former athletes including Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, and Erica Stokes have publicly said that Károlyi was verbally and psychologically abusive during workouts. Károlyi&#x27;s constant critical remarks about weight and body type were said to drive some gymnasts to develop eating disorders and low self-esteem. Some gymnasts, such as Phillips, Moceanu, and 1988 Olympian Chelle Stack also said that they were compelled to continue training and competing even when coping with serious injuries such as broken bones. In one interview, Moceanu (one of Károlyi&#x27;s final protégés) said, &quot;I&#x27;m sure Béla saw injuries, but if you were injured, Béla didn&#x27;t want to see it... You had to deal with it.&quot; Károlyi also was said to strictly monitor his gymnasts&#x27; food intake: Moceanu, for instance, stated that at meets away from home, gymnasts were limited to consuming as few as 900 calories a day. Even Károlyi&#x27;s supporters have admitted that at certain competitions, his gymnasts ate so sparingly that members of the men&#x27;s gymnastics team smuggled food to them in their hotel rooms.

However, many of Károlyi&#x27;s most prominent gymnasts have vehemently defended him against these allegations. Nadia Comăneci, in her 2004 memoir &quot;Letters to a Young Gymnast&quot;, remarked that she literally trusted Károlyi with her life. She also stated that in Romania, the gymnasts at Károlyi&#x27;s school consumed well-balanced diets and, in fact, ate better than most other civilians in the country at the time. Olympic medalists and Károlyi gymnasts Mary Lou Retton, Phoebe Mills and Kim Zmeskal among others, have also praised Károlyi and his training regimen.

A number of former Károlyi gymnasts, both supporters and detractors, have acknowledged that some of the allegations about Károlyi were true, but they have also claimed that the ends—medals—justified the means. In Joan Ryan&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Little Girls in Pretty Boxes&quot;, 1992 Olympian Betty Okino said: &quot;What Béla did worked. He motivated me by getting me mad.&quot; Some have claimed that Károlyi stopped treating gymnasts harshly when parents directly requested that he do so. In a column she wrote rebutting many of the claims of &quot;Little Girls in Pretty Boxes&quot;, Okino wrote, &quot;Károlyi structured his training in a way that built your physical and mental strength to such a remarkable level that even he couldn&#x27;t tear you down. Béla wanted to know that when push came to shove, his athletes could handle any situation thrown at them.&quot;

In an interview in the edition of December 8, 2007, of the Romanian newspaper &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot;, Adrian Goreac, the coach of the Romanian national gymnastics team from 1981 to 1990, after Károlyi left, spoke of Károlyi&#x27;s &quot;dictatorial regime&quot; during his time coaching the Romanian gymnastics team.

In November 2008, Emilia Eberle, a Romanian national team member during the Károlyi coaching era, gave an interview to KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California, claiming that while she was on the national team, both Béla and Márta Károlyi regularly beat her and her teammates for mistakes they made in practice or competition. &quot;In one word, I can say it was brutal,&quot; she told KCRA. Other Romanian team members including Ecaterina Szabo and Rodica Dunca, as well as Géza Pozsár, the team choreographer who defected with the Károlyis, have made similar charges of physical abuse. When asked in 2008 to comment on the allegations, Béla said, &quot;I ignore it. I&#x27;m not even commenting. These people are really trash.&quot;

===Role in sexual abuse scandal===
While Károlyi has not been personally implicated in the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal which was reported beginning in 2016, gymnasts said that many instances of sexual abuse perpetrated by former team doctor Larry Nassar occurred at the Karolyi Ranch. Nassar reportedly groomed athletes for abuse and gained their trust in part by covertly providing them with food in defiance of Károlyi&#x27;s strict dietary guidelines. Some gymnasts also said that the strict discipline and conditions at the ranch made them feel inhibited from reporting Nassar&#x27;s abuses. As a result of the scandal, in July 2017 USA Gymnastics canceled its plans to buy Karolyi Ranch. In January 2018 USA Gymnastics announced they were cutting ties with Karolyi Ranch altogether.

==Death==
Károlyi died on November 15, 2024, at age 82.

<text>Changgyeonggung () is a palace located in Seoul, South Korea.

The palace was built in the mid-15th century by King Sejong for his father, Taejong. It was originally named &quot;Suganggung&quot;, but it was renovated and enlarged in 1483 by King Seongjong, at which time it received its current name. Many structures were destroyed during Japan&#x27;s multiple late 15th to 16th (1592) century attempts to conquer Korea and invade China. It was rebuilt by successive Joseon Kings but was once again largely destroyed by the Japanese in the early 20th century. This time, it was torn down methodically to make room for a modern park, a showplace for the empire, akin to Tokyo&#x27;s Ueno Park.
During the Japanese colonial period, the Japanese built a zoo, botanical garden, and museum on the site. It was called &quot;Changgyeongwon park&quot;, the &quot;won&quot; standing for the Korean word &#x27;zoo&#x27;. After independence in 1945 and the turmoil and destruction of the 1950-53 Korean War, the zoo was restocked through donations of wealthy Koreans as well as gifts from foreign zoos. In 1983, the zoo and botanical garden were relocated to present-day Seoul Grand Park.

==Composition and buildings==
Today its main points of interest are as follows:

* Honghwamun ()
: Honghwamun is the palace&#x27;s main gate and faces eastward like the central part of the palace. First built in 1484, it burned down during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was rebuilt in 1616. A ball pavilion (skipjack) was built on either side of this two-tiered wooden gate. As you pass through the gate, Okcheongjo Bridge comes into view. Between the arches under the bridge&#x27;s parapet are carved goblins (dokkaebi) that are intended to ward off evil spirits. Okcheongjo Bridge was built approximately 500 years ago and serves as a symbolic entry to the courtyard. 
: At this gate the king met the citizens: King Yeongjo (1694–1774, r. 1726–1774) collected public opinion here in 1750 when enacting Gyunyeok Act (Equalized Tax Act); Here, King Jeongjo (1752–1800, r. 1776–1800) handed out rice to the poor in 1795.
: Honghwamun was designated as South Korean National Treasure 384 on 12 January 1963.

* Okcheongyo ()
: The Okcheongyo Bridge was built in 1483. It is 9.9 meters long by 6.6 meters wide and supported by twin arches. Between the arches under the bridge&#x27;s parapet are carved goblins (dokkaebi) that are intended to ward off evil spirits. Okcheongjo Bridge serves as a symbolic entry to the courtyard. Okcheongyo Bridge was designated as National Treasure 386 on January 21, 1863.

* Myeongjeongjeon ()
: Myeongjeongjeon is the palace&#x27;s main hall, where state affairs such as meetings with officials and royal banquets were held. First built in 1484, it was burned down during the Japanese invasion of 1592. Rebuilt in 1616, it is the oldest main hall of all the palaces in Seoul. It is smaller than the two-story main halls of Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung because it was originally built as the queen&#x27;s living quarters, rather than as a throne hall. Although it is a simple, one-story structure, Myeongjeongjeon was built on an elevated stone yard that imbued it with the dignity of the main hall. Running through the courtyard in front is a three-level walkway whose centre path was for the king&#x27;s use only. Surrounding the entire area is a wall-like structure of single-room units which were used by the royal guards or for royal funerals. Myeongjeongjeon is designated as National Treasure 226.

* Munjeongjeon ()
: Munjeongjeon is a council hall where the king dealt with routine state affairs. Unlike the throne hall, which faces east, this building faces south. Such a palace layout with a secondary structure facing a different direction than a throne hall is highly unusual in Korea. Munjeongjeon was also used to enshrine royal tablets after funerals. It was dismantled during the Japanese occupation. Munjeongjeon as it stands today was restored in 1986 along with Munjeongjeon Gate and the eastern part of the roofed corridor. According to the nineteenth-century &quot;Painting of the Eastern Palace&quot;, Munjeongjeon was partitioned from Sungmundang and Myeongjeongjeon by a wall, and had a small annexe; the courtyard was surrounded by a wall-like corridor. This part has not yet been restored.
: Built in 1483, destroyed in 1592, rebuilt in 1616, burnt down in 1830 and again rebuilt in 1834. King Jeongjo and King Heonjong were born here.
: First built in 1484 during the reign of King Seongjong, destroyed in 1592, rebuilt in 1616, burnt down in 1830 and again rebuilt in 1834.
: Originally named &quot;Sunyeongjeon&quot;, it was first built in 1484, rebuilt most recently in 1834; main building in the Yeonjo area where kings and their families lived.
: Constructed in 1909 during the reign of Emperor Sunjong, with 366-square-meter island and bridge added in 1984. The smaller pond is 1,107 square meters and the larger one is 6,483 square meters.

On May 13, 1762, that courtyard in front of Munjeongjeon witnessed the most tragic incident of the century. It had been reported to King Yeongjo that Crown Prince Sado was mentally ill and behaving erratically. Furious with the Prince, his father ordered him to be sealed alive in a large rice chest, where he died eight days later at the age of 27. King Yeongjo later became remorseful and gave his son the posthumous title &#x27;Sado&#x27; (&quot;thinking in sorrow&quot;). It is often believed that Crown Prince Sado was a victim of a conspiracy by his political adversaries, but this is rebutted in the &quot;Memoirs of Lady Hyegyŏng&quot;, which was written by Prince Sado&#x27;s wife Lady Hyegyŏng.

<text>Gyeonghuigung (, &#x27;Palace of Serene Harmony&#x27;) is a palace located in Seoul, South Korea. It was one of the &quot;Five Grand Palaces&quot; built by the Joseon Dynasty.

==History==

The land where Gyeonghuigung stood was originally the site of the house of Prince Jeongwon, who was the father of King Injo. Construction began in the 1600s during the reign of King Gwanghaegun and was completed in 1617. The name of the palace was originally Gyeongdeokgung (경덕궁; 慶德宮), but it was later changed to avoid naming it similar to the posthumous name of Prince Jeongwon. In the latter Joseon period, Gyeonghuigung served as the secondary palace (which was called &quot;igung&quot; (離宮) in those times) for the king, and as it was situated on the west side of Seoul, it was also called &quot;Seo-gwol&quot; (西闕, a palace of the west). The secondary palace was usually the palace where the King moves to in times of emergency.
From King Injo to King Cheoljong, about ten kings of Joseon dynasty stayed here at Gyeonghuigung. For a time, it was of a considerable size that contained 100 buildings. For the king&#x27;s royal audience, there were the Sungjeongjeon and Jajeongjeon buildings, and for sleeping, Yungbokjeon (융복전; 隆福殿) and Hoesangjeon (회상전; 會祥殿) buildings. The palace also used to have an arched bridge that connected it with Deoksugung called Honggyo (홍교; 虹橋).
Most of Gyeonghuigung was lost to a fire that broke out in the 19th century, during the reigns of King Sunjo. The Japanese dismantled what remained of the palace during their occupation of the Korean peninsula, and a school for Japanese citizens was built on the site. Two major structures of the former palace — the Sungjeongjeon throne hall and the Heunghwamun gate — were disassembled and moved to other parts of Seoul. Reconstruction started in the 1990s as part of the South Korean government&#x27;s initiative to rebuild the &quot;Five Grand Palaces&quot; that were heavily destroyed by the Japanese.

==Architecture==
===Heunghwamun===
Heunghwamun () is the main entrance door to the palace.
The entrance was built in 1616, but it was briefly moved to be an entrance for the after the destruction of the palace, and later used as a main entrance for the Silla Hotel of Jangchung-dong until it was finally restored to its original purpose. Heunghwamun is designated as Municipal Treasure 19.

===Geuncheongyo===
Geuncheongyo () is a bridge at the route passed through the Heunghwamun. It was built in 1619, but was buried into soil during Japanese rule until it was restored in 2001.

===Sungjeongjeon===
Sungjeongjeon () is the main hall of the palace. It was built in 1616 but was moved to Dongguk University in 1926 and repurposed as a Buddhist temple during the Japanese colonial period, and moved back to original location and renovated between 1988 and 1994. Its considered an example of mid-Joseon period architecture. Sungjeongjeon is designated as Municipal Treasure 20.

===Jajeongjeon===
Jajeongjeon () is a hall restored following depictions in &quot;&quot;.

===Taenyeongjeon===
Taenyeongjeon () is a hall restored following depictions in &quot;Seogwoldoan&quot;.

==Present use==
It is Historic Site No. 271.

In the palace grounds today are the Seoul Museum of History and the Seoul Museum of Art. It also housed Prada&#x27;s Transformer in 2009.

<doc id="901719" wikidata="Q1431699" url="?curid=901719" title="Kerry Airport">
<text>Kerry Airport (; ), often called Farranfore Airport, is an international airport in Farranfore, County Kerry, Ireland. It is north off the Ring of Kerry and southeast of the county town, Tralee. Passenger services are operated by Ryanair and more recently French airline Chalair. In 2022, Kerry Airport handled 355,043 passengers; a decrease of 4% since 2019.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Kerry Airport was incorporated as a public limited company in July 1968, with its main objective of building and managing an airport at Farranfore. Various share capital fundraising programmes were undertaken and, together with great assistance from the various statutory bodies over the years, the airport has developed from a runway of 1,090 metres x 23 metres commissioned in 1969, to a runway of 1,239m x 30m commissioned in 1989, and a new runway of 2,000m x 45m opened in May 1994.

The first aircraft to land at Kerry Airport, on 25 August 1969, was piloted by Captain Milo Carr of the Department of Transport and Power. For a number of years the only aircraft using the aerodrome were light private aircraft and the occasional charter or cargo flight; extensive parachuting also took place. The first scheduled service was inaugurated in July 1979, using an Islander aircraft operated by Aer Arann.

Encouraged by the apparent success of other regional airports in Ireland, the board of directors drew up a development plan to lengthen and widen the runway to 1,200m x 30m and to extend and upgrade the terminal buildings and to install an Instrument Landing System and appropriate lighting.

On 5 August 1983, an Air France Concorde flew by Kerry Airport during visits to Dublin and Shannon Airport.

The runway was completed on schedule; the first scheduled flight into Kerry was on 22 May 1989 from Dublin by Aer Lingus, followed the next day by Ryanair from London-Luton. The contract for the new runway of 2,000m x 45m and the new terminal was signed in May 1993, and the official sod-turning ceremony was performed by Dick Spring TD, the Tánaiste.

The Runway 08/26 was licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority on 20 May 1994, and the first flight landed at 13:23 local time on 20 May. It was a PA28 aircraft registration G-BLSD from Manchester, piloted by C. Gurley. This was followed by the first commercial flight by Aer Lingus, a Saab 340. Its registration was EI-CFD and it was commanded by Captain Peter Heinz.

===Development since the 2000s===
The Government of Ireland has previously subsidised regional services under a PSO programme. A tender is offered for airlines to provide a minimum level of service in return for subsidy and a monopoly of the route. The tender is published in the &quot;Official Journal of the European Union&quot;. Aer Arann were re-awarded the PSO for the 2005 offer programme but in 2008 it was awarded to Ryanair.

The airport is a public limited company, but is not quoted on any stock exchange. It had an operating profit of €179,329 in 2009 on a turnover of €6,252,221. This represented a fall of 32% from the previous financial year. The operating profit for the year 2015 was €30,980.

In January 2011, it was announced that 20 of the airport&#x27;s 65 staff would be made redundant, owing to a fall in passenger numbers following Ryanair&#x27;s withdrawal from its public service obligation (PSO) contract.

It was announced in February 2012 that, owing to the codeshare agreement with Aer Lingus, the currently operated Dublin service with Aer Arann would be operated from 30 October 2012 under the brand Aer Lingus Regional. Aer Arann was later rebranded as Stobart Air. Passenger numbers on the Dublin route operated by Aer Lingus Regional, increased by 13.5% in 2014.

In February 2017, Ryanair announced they would commence a twice-weekly service to Berlin–Schönefeld from 2 November 2017.

In January 2018 Aer Lingus Regional, operated by Stobart Air, following a public tendering process was awarded a Public Service Obligation contract, linking the airport with Dublin, for the next four years. However, Stobart Air collapsed part way through. Ryanair subsequently picked up the route, this time on a commercial basis with no subsidy.

In January 2020, Ryanair announced they would commence a twice weekly flight to Manchester from 29 March 2020, every Thursday and Sunday.

Planning permission has been granted in 2023 for a new two storey extension to the terminal, additional departure gate, new arrivals &amp; baggage reclaim area. A further planning application was also submitted in 2023 for a new business jet hangar, to cater for the increasing number of business jets serving the airport.

<doc id="901721" wikidata="Q887416" url="?curid=901721" title="Mercury Capri">
<text>Capri (later Mercury Capri) is a nameplate marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury division of Ford Motor Company over three generations between 1970 and 1994.

From 1970 to 1978, the Capri was a sport compact marketed in North America by the Lincoln-Mercury division without any Ford or Mercury divisional branding; it was a captive import, manufactured by Ford of Europe and sold simply as the Capri. 

From 1979 to 1986, the second generation Capri became part of the Mercury model line as a U.S. built pony car, a badge engineered variant of the contemporary Ford Mustang. 

Ford Australia produced the third-generation Mercury Capri roadster from 1991 to 1994, which Ford marketed as the Ford Capri outside of North America.

In North America, the first and third generations of the Capri were marketed without a direct Ford-brand counterpart but were sold in other markets under the Ford brand.

The name derives from the Italian island of Capri, and has been used by all three Ford divisions. The 1952 Lincoln Capri marked the first use of the nameplate, serving as a trim level through 1959. From 1962 to 1964, Ford of Britain introduced a Ford Consul Capri two-door hardtop coupe. For 1966 and 1967, the Capri name was first used by Mercury to denote the standard trim of the Mercury Comet.

For 1968, Ford of Europe developed the Ford Capri two-door coupé as its European counterpart to the Mustang. Like the Mustang, the Capri was styled with a long hood and a short deck, with a fastback-style roofline.

==First generation (1970–1978)==

=== Capri (1970–1975) ===
The first generation of the Capri was a captive import produced by Ford of Europe in Cologne, Germany. Introduced in Europe for 1968 (and designed by Ford of Britain using locally sourced components from the Cortina MkII and Escort with plans dating back to 1964, when the development of a European variant of the Mustang commenced), the Ford Capri was marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury Division starting in April 1970. While sold through Mercury dealers, the Capri did not carry any divisional identification. Priced at $2,300 at the time of its launch, ($ in dollars ) the Capri was marketed as an economical sporty coupe (with no upscale trim levels, unlike its European-market variants e.g. the GT, RS, L, XL, and XLR which were trim levels), far smaller than the Mercury Cougar and Montego.

In its adaptation to the American market, the Capri saw several minor revisions, with the two rectangular headlights of the Ford Capri replaced by four circular headlamps (shared with some upscale Capri models sold for the European market e.g. the RS or GT - the rectangular lighting did not meet FMVSS 108), grille-mounted turn signals, and side marker lights; Rostyle wheels were fitted as standard equipment. While produced in Germany as a variant of the Ford Cortina, the Capri adopted powertrain commonality with the newly introduced Ford Pinto. Originally powered by a 1.6 L Kent &quot;crossflow&quot; inline-four, the Capri received a 2.0 L &quot;OHC&quot; inline-four for 1971. As an option, for 1972, Mercury introduced a 2.6 L Cologne V6, becoming the first American-market vehicle marketed by Ford Motor Company with a V6 engine. For 1974, the V6 was enlarged to 2.8 L, as Ford revised castings for both the engine block and cylinder heads.

For 1973, the front bumper was revised to comply with 5-mph bumper standards. The previous chrome bumper was reinforced with a steel tube and attached to the frame with shock absorbers (extending the length of the body several inches). As part of the change, the Capri saw revisions to the grille, tail lights, and its rear quarter trim grilles. As part of an interior revision, the Capri was given a new steering wheel, dashboard, and seat trim along with a redesigned wiring harness. For 1974, 5 mph bumpers were fitted to both front and rear, replacing the previous chrome tube bumpers with reinforced body-colored plastic bumpers.

A Mercury version of the Ford Mustang II badged as a Capri (as evidenced by a proposal using the Mustang II&#x27;s 2+2 body with a rounded rear quarter window style and characteristic bodyside sculpting) was briefly considered, but the strong sales of the Ford Capri (Mk1) as a captive import shelved those plans.

===Capri II (1976–1978)===

After the 1974 redesign of the Ford Capri, Lincoln-Mercury commenced American sales of the Capri Mk II in 1975 as an early 1976 model. Skipping the 1975 model year entirely, Lincoln-Mercury renamed the Capri to the Capri II, again omitting any formal divisional identification from the vehicle. While sharing similar styling to its predecessor, the Capri II adopted a hatchback roofline. As with the 1970–1974 Capri, to adapt to the American market, the Capri II was fitted with quad sealed-beam headlamps (foreshadowing the style of the Capri III which was only sold in Europe from 1978 onwards), grille-mounted turn signal lamps, 5-mph bumpers, and body-color side-view mirror(s).

Again maintaining powertrain commonality with the Ford Pinto, Ford Mustang II and Mercury Bobcat, the Capri II was fitted with the 2.3 L OHC engine, offering a 2.8 L V6 as an option.

After the 1977 model year, Lincoln-Mercury ended imports of the Capri II from Ford of Europe, with unsold examples sold during the 1978 model year. In total, 513,500 Capri/Capri IIs were sold from 1970 to 1978 by Lincoln-Mercury. At its peak, yearly Capri sales in North America were the highest for any import vehicle (except for the Volkswagen Beetle). Ford of Europe continued production of the car in &quot;Capri III&quot; form until 1986 - to all intents and purposes a facelifted Capri II.

===Reception===
&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine on the 1970 Capri 1600: &quot;...But styling and image sells cars, right? And if that&#x27;s true, then it&#x27;s our opinion that Lincoln-Mercury has a real winner in the Capri.&quot;

&quot;R&amp;T&quot; on the Capri 2000 in February 1971: &quot;The Capri has a lot to recommend it. It&#x27;s a solidly built, sporty compact car and (especially with the 2-liter engine) fun to drive.&quot;

&quot;R&amp;T&quot; on the Capri 2600 V6 in March 1972: &quot;...the Capri 2600 V6 is an outstanding car. We&#x27;ll bet Lincoln-Mercury dealers won&#x27;t be able to get enough of them to satisfy the demand.&quot;

&quot;R&amp;T&quot; on the Capri 2800 V6: &quot;...the V6 Capri remains a very attractive sporting car. It&#x27;s solid as a Mercedes, still compact and light in the context of 1974 barrier busters, fast, reasonably economical of fuel, precise-handling, and quick-stopping: its engine and drivetrain are both sporty and refined. It&#x27;s no wonder Lincoln-Mercury sold nearly 120,000 of them in 1973...&quot;

&quot;R&amp;T&quot; on the Capri II 2.8 V6: &quot;Once again we can report that the Capri V6 is an attractive, competent, and enjoyable car at a reasonable price. It goes, stops, and handles, it&#x27;s well built and it has that sturdy, precise European character that makes it something special for Americans and Canadians. On top of all this, it&#x27;s a more practical car because of its new hatchback body. A quality, European car at a realistic price-what more could one want.&quot;

The car features prominently in the 1982 movie &quot;The First Time,&quot; with Jennifer Jason-Leigh, where her grandmother gives her hers after she buys a new Corvette and teaches her to drive a stick.

===Special editions===
1976–1977 JPS Capri II, Capri II S - Black or white car body with gold striping, &quot;black chrome&quot; trim, gold and black styled steel wheels and gold badging and grille surround.

In Europe, the JPS Capri II celebrated the success of the John Player Special-sponsored Team Lotus Formula 1 team and emulated its black and gold livery. In the US, anti-tobacco advertising laws required a name change to Capri II S. The interior received special seats and door panels: black with gold cloth inserts. 

==Second generation (1979–1986)==

For the 1979 model year, a second generation of the Capri was introduced. As part of several changes over its predecessor, the Capri was officially part of the Mercury model line as Lincoln-Mercury ended captive imports of the Ford Capri in favor of creating a Mercury counterpart of the 1979 Ford Mustang. Sharing the Fox platform with the Mustang, the 1979 Mercury Capri marked the first Mercury &quot;pony car&quot; since the 1970 Mercury Cougar.

While visually similar to the Mustang, the second-generation Capri was offered solely in the three-door hatchback configuration. The Capri was styled with its own front fascia, a vertically mounted grille, and dark-tinted tail light with horizontally ribbed lenses. In place of the widely flared wheel openings of the Mustang, the Capri was styled with slightly flared wheel openings and widened front and rear fenders. For 1983, the Capri received a redesign of the rear hatchback, distinguished with a large compound-curve &quot;bubble-back&quot; rear window. Along with that revision came newly styled tail lights, rear bumper cover and front end grille. For 1984, the front fascia of the Capri RS was fitted with a front air dam with fog lamps similar to the one used on Mustang Cobras and GTs from 1980 to 1982, with the same exterior continuing through 1986. The 1986 Capri received the federally mandated high mounted center brake lamp.

Along with the base-trim Capri, Mercury offered the Capri Ghia (shared with the Mustang), Capri L, Capri GS, Capri RS, and Capri Turbo RS. The Capri RS/Turbo RS was believed to be the equivalent of the GT and in most instances it was. However early RS Capris could have the base 4 cylinder or even 6 cylinder option. During its production, the second-generation Capri maintained powertrain commonality with the Ford Mustang, with inline-four, inline-6, V6, and V8 engines offered during its production; the only Mustang model with no Capri equivalent was the Mustang SVO.

The second-generation Capri was produced through the 1986 model year. For 1987, while the Mustang underwent a mid-cycle update (lasting to 1993), Mercury withdrew the Capri, focusing on the Cougar XR7 as its two-door performance vehicle; not offering another sports coupe until the FWD Cougar in 1999.

===Special editions===
1981–1983 Black Magic - Black cars with gold striping, gold metric TRX wheels and a gold cat&#x27;s head on each side of the front valance. The interior received special black seats with sand-colored inserts (code YA), with Recaro seating optional in 1982 (code TA) and Sport Performance seating optional in 1983 (code HA). In the 1981 and 1982 models years the Black Magic option could be ordered with polar white (code 9D) paint but otherwise had the same exterior appointments as the black cars (gold striping, gold TRX wheels, and gold cat&#x27;s heads). Magazine ads for the 9D Black Magic used the term &quot;white lightning&quot; but the name of the package was still &quot;Black Magic&quot;. The 1983 model is extremely rare and the only Black Magic to receive the compound rear window.

1983 Crimson Cat - Bright red (code 27) paint with gold striping and Cougar XR-7 TRX wheels set this car apart. Crimson Cat received black sport performance seating with red inserts (code KA).

1984 Charcoal Turbo RS - A Capri RS Turbo that was only available in charcoal upper-silver lower exterior paint with light grey striped rub moldings, Garrett 60 trim turbocharger, enhanced multi-port EFI four-cylinder engine, Michelin TRX package, 5.0 HO Sway bars, 3.45:1 limited-slip rear axle, hood scoop, and orange and red lettering and striping. Sun- and T-top roofs were optional.

1985 Mercury Motorsport Capri- Built as pace car replicas to commemorate the 1985 Detroit Grand Prix &amp; MotorCity 100. These were also cosmetically modified by American Sunroof Company for Mercury and are highly sought after for their low production of less than 50 cars and availability in only Michigan &amp; Ohio.

===Motorsport===
This particular generation was successful in the Trans Am Series, winning the championship from 1984 to 1985 with an aftermarket V8 engine. The Mercury Capri 5.0 L was the car used by the Jack Roush team with Wally Dallenbach Jr. driving to win the 1985 Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans AM championship.

=== Variants ===

==== ASC McLaren (1984–1986) ====
ASC (American Sunroof Corporation, now known as American Specialty Cars) produced several conversions of Mercury Capris from 1984 to 1986. Along with convertible conversions, hatchbacks were restyled (renamed as Coupes by the company).

The Coupes were tuned and enhanced with several suspension and visual upgrades including striping, a built-in radar detector, ground effects, Hella fog lights, headlight and taillight covers and Italian Campagnolo honeycomb-style wheels.

For 1984, Coupes (10 produced) were all painted midnight blue. The 1985–1986 coupes (150 produced in 1985) were either painted blue or white. In 1986 (115 made), the last year for the coupes, customers had an even larger choice of colors, including smoke charcoal grey and raven black, joining the Oxford white as well as Shadow Blue Metallic, and silver metallic.

In comparison to the coupes, convertibles were a far more involved project, as the conversion required the redesign of the unibody chassis. As part of the conversion, the convertible top replaced the rear seats. The manual top design is specific to the vehicle, requiring design-specific equipment (such as seals, weatherstripping, and windshield moldings). Fabrication required a replacement rear deck lid, floor reinforcements, quarter panel caps, tonneau cover and a windshield that was raked back an extra 10 degrees

In total, 557 convertibles were built during its 1984–1986 production run.

===== Powertrain upgrades =====
ASC McLaren coupes were fitted with BFGoodrich Comp T/A radials. The 225/50/15 low profile size of these tires (as opposed to the standard 5.0 L Capri&#x27;s 225/60/15) raised the ASC/McLaren Coupe&#x27;s effective gear ratio from 3.08:1 to approximately 3.35:1.

These were the quickest cars produced by Ford in 1985 and 1986 with zero to sixty times well under six seconds and quarter-mile times in the mid-13 second range.

====Ford Mustang (Mexico, 1981–1984)====

The third-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured in the Ford Cuautitlán Izcalli plant (located outside Mexico City) from 1979 to 1984. Produced for sale in Mexico, the vehicles were produced in both hatchback and notchback coupe body configurations.

From 1981 to 1984, Cuautitlán Assembly produced the Mustang using components from both the Mustang and Mercury Capri. Along with the taillights of the Capri, the Mustangs were produced using the front fascia of the Capri (with Ford badging) from 1982 to 1983. From 1983 to 1984, the facility produced the Mustang hatchback with front and rear fenders of the Capri, along with its &quot;bubble-back&quot; rear hatch.

== Third generation (1991–1994)==

For the 1991 model year, the Mercury Capri made its return to the Mercury division after a five-year hiatus. To give Lincoln-Mercury a competitor for the Mazda MX-5 Miata and Toyota MR2, the Capri was released as a two-door roadster. In a fashion similar to the first-generation Mercury Capri, the third-generation version is a captive import; produced by Ford of Australia alongside its Ford Capri counterpart and the Ford Falcon, the Mercury Capri was intended for American exports. For the first time since 1978, the Mercury Capri was the first Mercury without any Ford counterpart in North America.

Derived from the Australian Ford Laser (sold in the United States as the first-generation Mercury Tracer), the Ford Capri also shares drivetrain commonality with the Mazda 323. To adapt the Capri for United States sale, Lincoln-Mercury made several changes over the Australian-market Capri. Along with the addition of a driver-side airbag (required to meet passive restraint requirements), the dashboard was changed to non-metric gauges; Mercury Capris are fitted with body-color bumpers.

While both two-door convertibles similar in size and price, the Mercury Capri and Mazda MX-5 featured major departures in powertrain and interior configurations, with the Capri adopting a front-wheel-drive powertrain. While the MX-5 was strictly a two-seat vehicle, the Capri was a 2+2, with (small) rear seats. Along with folding back seats (allowing access to the trunk), the Capri also offered the option of a removable hardtop (similar to the MX-5).

During its entire production, the Mercury Capri was sold under two trim levels: base trim and XR2, distinguished largely by the powertrain. The base trim was equipped with a 100 hp Mazda 1.6 L DOHC inline-4; the XR2 was equipped with a turbocharged version of the 1.6 L engine, rated at 132 hp. A five-speed manual transmission was standard for both trims, with a four-speed automatic available on base-trim Capris. From 1991 to 1993, the Capri was sold with minimal revisions. The XR2 received standard 3-spoke 15&quot; alloy wheels for 1992, and for 1994, the Capri received new tail lights, bumpers, and wheel designs.

<text>Actual idealism is a form of idealism, developed by Giovanni Gentile, that was influenced by the absolute idealism of G. W. F. Hegel.

== Doctrine ==
Gentile calls his philosophy &quot;actualism&quot; or &quot;actual idealism&quot;, because, in it, the only true reality is the pure act of the &quot;thinking that thinks&quot;, i.e. self-consciousness in the present moment, in which the spirit that comprises all existing is manifested. Reality lies in the productive and self-creative act of thinking, rather than in the object thought.

The Spirit is Thought, and Thought is a perennial activity in which there is no distinction between subject and object. Gentile therefore opposes any dualism and naturalism claiming the unity of nature and spirit (monism), that is spirit and matter within the thinking consciousness, giving it a gnoseological and ontological primacy. Consciousness is seen as a synthesis of subject and object, synthesis of an act in which the first places the second. Therefore, they do not make sense only spiritualist or only materialist orientations, as it does not have the clear division between spirit and matter of Platonism, as reality is unique: here is evident the influence of Renaissance pantheism and Brunian immanentism, more than Hegelianism

Unlike Benedetto Croce (proponent of absolute historicism or historicist idealism for which all reality is &quot;history&quot; and not an act in the Aristotelian sense) Gentile appreciates Hegel not so much the historicist horizon, as the idealistic system based on consciousness as a &quot;transcendental subject&quot;, or the assumption of consciousness as the principle of reality, a position that brings him closer to Fichte. Also according to Gentile there is an error, in Hegel, in the setting of the dialectic, but in a different way from Croce: Hegel would have built his dialectic with elements of the &quot;thought&quot;, or that of the determined thought and science. For Gentile, on the other hand, only in the &quot;thinking in action&quot; consists the dialectical self-consciousness that encompasses everything, while the &quot;thought&quot; is an illusory fact.

Gentile&#x27;s actualism therefore aims to reform the Hegelian dialectic, to make it an authentically absolute idealism, with the addition of the theory of the pure act and the explication of the relationship between &quot;logic of thinking&quot; and &quot;logic of thought.&quot;

Taking up Fichte, the philosopher asserts that the spirit is foundational insofar as it is the unity of consciousness and self-consciousness, thought in act; the act of thinking thought, or &quot;pure act,&quot; is the principle and form of becoming reality, outside of which there is nothing: there are no empirical individuals separate from the absolute I; error, evil, and death have no consistency before Truth and the Eternal; even the past lives only in the present moment of remembrance.

According to Gentile, the dialectic of the pure act is implemented in particular in the opposition between the subjectivity represented by art (thesis) and the objectivity represented by religion (antithesis) to which philosophy (synthesis) provides the solution. The &quot;logic of thinking thought,&quot; understood as an archetypal-ontological instance, is a philosophical and dialectical logic; the &quot;logic of thought thought,&quot; on the other hand, is formal and erroneous, because the individual thoughts coming from original thinking are merely a contemplative reflection, a kind of &quot;by-product.&quot;.

=== Abstract thought and concrete thought ===
Reality is thus not a fact, a factual and static datum, but an act, an action of the spirit, a dynamic activity endowed with an infinite power. Potentiality and actuality are to be understood here not so much in the Aristotelian sense as in the Neoplatonist sense borrowed from German idealism.

Although realists admit that the external world is the only knowable one, enclosable within a &quot;static&quot; concept based on the repeatability of experience that would testify to the existence of a solid basis transcending the mutability of our perceptions, they continue to dogmatically assume that there is something real independently of the thought that thinks it.

But a reality thought of as a &quot;presupposition of thought,&quot; that is, thought of as &quot;unthought&quot; (being external, prior to thought), is a contradictory, dogmatic, and arbitrary concept that corresponds to the empirical point of view. Empiricism is an abstract point of view, because it separates the object from the ego, from the subject that posits it, and thus &quot;abstracts&quot; a part from the whole. The only concrete reality is the unitary synthesis of subject-object, which Gentile calls self-consciousness, in which it is possible to recompose the opposition between &quot;thinking thought&quot; and &quot;thought thought&quot;, between &quot;act&quot; and &quot;fact&quot;, or according to Gentile&#x27;s terminology, between &quot;concrete logos&quot; and &quot;abstract logos&quot;.

=== Immediacy and mediation ===
The actual self-consciousness of thought is not immediate subjectivity, but mediated. Assuming the non-ego as opposite to the ego is in fact, at the beginning, an abstract and therefore immediate positing of thought that does not see itself in the objects of the world, a positing without mediation. Conversely, the transcendental (self-conscious) Ego is a mediated consciousness of itself, because it cannot subsist without consciousness of the other than itself, that is, of the world.

Gentile rejects as abstract the Kantian table of the twelve categories, which depend in fact on the only true concrete judgment constituted by the &quot;I think&quot; (or aperception):

=== Empirical self and transcendental self ===
The transcendental self that operates this synthesis must be distinguished from the &quot;empirical self&quot;: the latter is an entity different from all the rest as well as from the other &quot;empirical&quot; selves, the transcendental self is on the contrary the universal subject, which can never be looked at from the outside, because it cannot be the object of our experience, like a show we attend as spectators, otherwise it will no longer be a subject but an object, a self indeed simply empirical.

Even if we presume to objectify the subjective act of the Ego, we would still lower it to one of the many finite objects of knowledge. For this reason it is an act that can never be transcended: its transcendental (not transcendent) nature cannot be understood as a completed act, but only as an &quot;act in progress&quot;, that is, an act that is never definitively concluded, constantly actualizing and in continuous becoming.

In this act lies that concrete character that remains for Gentile as a fundamental need also in the act of Education, understood as self-education of the mind based not on the otherness of the teacher and the pupil, but on the unity of the same process that are the school and the life, the Pedagogy and the Philosophy, theory and practice.

=== The autoctisis of the mind ===
Actual thought is in fact &quot;the center in which the principle of life is, from which every reality sprouts&quot;: actualism is the awareness of this center.

Thinking is at the same time an act, a constant process of self-creation or, as Gentile says, of &quot;autoctisis&quot;, with which by thinking it places itself and the world at the same time, thus becoming aware of itself .

The self-production of the mind as &quot;causa sui ipsius&quot;, however, is not prior to the act with which thought is thought, but is this same act, because one cannot formulate thoughts without the awareness of formulating. Moreover, the nature of such a self-production is essentially the volition, free creation of the feeling, whose ethics is not external but is one with this self-production, which alienates itself in an external reality to return to itself.

The moment of objectification, of the non-ego, is essential as it constitutes the very thought of the ego; the latter gives himself an object in order to carry out his activity, because otherwise a thought without content could not exist.

=== The circle of self-awareness: negation and affirmation ===
The starting point of the circle of self-consciousness is therefore an inactual potentiality, but it does not exist only ideally, because without immediacy mediation is not possible.
That is, the abstract is still a moment of the concrete, and it provides fuel for it to the extent that it is denied. The abstract cannot be combusted once and for all, otherwise becoming, or the dialectic of thinking, would stop. Rather, each time the abstract is overcome in the concrete, the concrete presents itself again as a new abstract, to be overcome endlessly.

=== Logic of abstract thought ===
The logic of the concrete therefore does not deny the object, but rather is aware of its abstractness, which it therefore recognizes by admitting alongside the dialectic of thought a logic of the abstract, as its degree or moment in becoming.

The logic of abstract thinking consists of the principle of identity, when being is made the object of thought, becoming identical with itself (A=A).

Being is the negation of thought, because it is external to the actuality of thought, a being that according to Eleatic or naturalistic philosophy would exist even when it is not thought.

Gentile points out that pure (natural) being, understood as the immediate and static &quot;A&quot;, cannot be identical to itself, being unthought and therefore unreal, whereas only thought, however abstract, can establish the relation of identity A = A. This relation thinks the being as distinct from the thought, but not separated.

The principle of identity then gives rise to the other determinations of Aristotelian logic such as that of the noncontradiction, of the excluded thirds, of the judgments and of the syllogism, a logic which thus remains fully valued by Gentile, and &quot;remains all solid and alive&quot; as a moment of the logic of the concrete.

=== Logic of concreteness ===
The determinateness of the abstract concept must thus be brought back to the concreteness of the actual life of the spirit, since it is proper for spiritual concreteness to create determined and circumscribed forms.


The determined forms of thought reality, that is, of &quot;experience,&quot; are expressions of the historical, spatiotemporal becoming of the Spirit: their multiplicity is not next to the unity of the Spirit, but belongs to the world as the object of consciousness, which unifies them all in a simple act.

The positivity of the historical determinations is thus reconciled with the original negativity of the self-concept, or self-consciousness of the determined concept. The act of the spirit is &quot;original negativity&quot; in that it is fulfilled at the moment in which it denies being as nature (the simple &quot;A&quot; devoid of connections), that is, it denies something that does not exist (mistakenly believed to exist by naturalism), and in this denial it realizes itself. Pure being is nothing because it is not even that conceptual being posited by abstract thought which, although inactual, provides fuel for the logic of the concrete.

The latter, also called authentic or speculative logic, highlights the continuity of the self through its progressive development in the principles me = me (differentiation in unity) but also me = non-me (unity in difference), for both find their synthesis in the real unity of the concrete and the abstract, of the subject thinking and the object thought.

=== Identity of history and current events ===
The transcendental feature of thought is such that the present thought of now includes the past and the future: the now, the present hour of thought is not between before and after, but encompasses the totality of time, and therefore it is eternal, an eternal becoming.

Gentile challenges Croce&#x27;s distinction between &quot;history that is made&quot; and &quot;history that is thought,&quot; between &quot;res gestae&quot; and &quot;historia rerum gestarum,&quot; asserting the contemporaneity of history, which &quot;should not be confused with Vico&#x27;s, which leaves out of itself one that unfolds in time : one where our eternal is the same time considered in the actuality of the spirit&quot;.

Historical knowledge consists of the reduction of the multiple to the concrete unity of the act, a synthesis of the opposing theses that conceive the spirit now as a historical dialectic, now as an ahistorical eternity. The identity of philosophy and history is therefore supported by Gentile in a much more radical way than Croce:

=== Evolution of the Spirit ===
The history of the spirit as an eternal presence of itself to itself is seen by Gentile as a progressive awareness of actualism.

Reforming the idealism of Hegel, he intends to purge it of both the developments going in the direction of Platonism attempted by the Hegelian Right and the Materialist results of the Hegelian Left. According to Gentile, Plato&#x27;s mistake is to assume the transcendence of ideas with respect to thought, remaining in a dualism of mind-matter based abstractly on a being, or a matter, presupposed to the thought, which is the characteristic feature of Greek philosophy.

Christian philosophy has the merit of overcoming the intellectual position of the Greeks, their materialistic representation of the world, through the arduous effort to spiritualize reality, while still affirming the transcendence of the Spirit. This will later be resolved by Spinoza in the immanent unity of substance, which Gentile intends to transform into an immanentism of a subjectivistic and spiritualistic kind.

The &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; of Descartes is a fundamental step in the journey of Western philosophy toward the self-consciousness of the actualist principle, as are George Berkeley&#x27;s famous adage &quot;esse est percipi&quot; and Kant&#x27;s &quot;a priori synthesis,&quot; though they still admit some realist and transcendent elements beyond the act of thinking. Berkeley, for example, while affirming the dependence of actual on the idea, i.e., that there are no objects outside our perceptions, nevertheless continues to attribute representations of reality to an objective and absolute mind, presupposed to the human mind. For Gentile, on the contrary, the only absolute thought is that which is immanent to becoming and to individual minds, i.e., actual thought.

With German idealism, thought finally becomes aware that there are no other realities outside itself, although Fichte remains in the dualism of the self and the not-self, which is never overcome by the actuality of thought, but only by an infinitely dilated practical act, without prejudice to the opposition between theory and practice. The same opposition is not overcome by Schelling either, if not by an intellectual intuition thought in a dogmatic way and thus always presupposed to the present consciousness.

Finally, Hegel, by tripling the single thought, conceives of logic and nature as something other than spirit, as &quot;thought&quot; rather than as moments of the same thinking act, so that his dialectic result is definitive, immutable, situated at the apex of the development of the mind. For Gentile, becoming is eternal, outside of time; otherwise arriving at such immutability would be at odds with its flow. To this end, Gentile endorses the need, already stated by Spaventa, to &quot;kantianize&quot; Hegel, by bringing the totality of the mind within the unity of the transcendental self.

In the concrete synthesis of this Ego, in its &quot;autoctisis&quot; outside of which there is nothing, that distinction between theory and praxis falls away, which Gentile reproached Croce for again, who was wrong to put a &quot;logic of fact&quot; in place of the actual logic of the Spirit, basing it on the distinction of the forms of the Spirit (art, philosophy, economics and ethics), which being &quot;distinct&quot; are only empty abstractions, divorced from the spiritual life, whose unity they compromise.

=== Art, religion and philosophy ===
Gentile is repeatedly reiterates the concreteness of the spiritual life of the thinking act, which unfolds in the dialectical triad thesis-antithesis-synthesis, represented by art, religion and philosophy.

* Art (thesis): we have seen how the initial moment of the Spirit&#x27;s self-production was immediacy, immediate subjectivity, in which art properly consists, which is precisely &quot;the form of subjectivity or, as we also say, of the spirit&#x27;s immediate individuality&quot;.

Gentile recovers the romantic conception of art as pure sentiment, giving it a character of lyrical intuition as De Sanctis and Croce have already done, however, challenging the latter that art is not mediated expression of feeling, but the feeling itself, an active force of the spirit that contains the whole in power. Moreover, art is not to be distinguished from other forms of human creativity as Croce believes, but permeates them all. And sentiment, as the core of art, will be increasingly revalued by Gentile to the point of saying that it is not only the potentiality of thought in action, but infinite creative energy that moves thought itself, and therefore the world, reality.

* Religion (antithesis): opposite to art, religion is the exaltation of the object, disconnected from the subject and therefore from the ideality and knowability of the spirit. As art was consciousness of the subject, religion is therefore consciousness of the object, but without rational mediation, and therefore requires a mystical adherence by the subject who feels like nothing, replacing revelation and grace with knowledge and autonomous will.

Religion, however, is a necessary moment in the development of the spirit that needs to alienate itself in order to become self-aware.
* Philosophy (synthesis): the moment of synthesis is thus represented by philosophy, in whose actuality the contradiction of art and religion, thought at the beginning as inactual, is resolved: these are simultaneously integrated in philosophy, which grasps them not as separate moments, but in the oneness of the final self-conscious act.

Gentile recognizes in Christianity the beginning of this process of evolution of the spirit, because it has always privileged the intimacy and the responsibility of the subject starting from the central dogma of the Man-God, which recomposes in unity the separation between the divine spirit and the human spirit.

=== Actualism and Christianity ===
Gentile thus presents his philosophy as essentially Christian, or the fulfillment of Christianity in a demythologized form, as a religion of interiority which he intends to purge of the elements of realism and transcendence brought historically by platonism and aristotelianism.

Restoring the authentic Christian tradition, Gentile proposes to renew even the spiritualistic instances of the Italian Risorgimento, removing them from Platonism and mysticism of transcendence, in favor of an immanent religiosity that excludes any barrier between sacred and profane, and in which every man finds within himself, and in every aspect of his life, the concrete unity of the spirit.

=== Actualism and science ===
Between art and religion lies science, which shares the limits of both without participating in their validity. Like art, science does not deal with the universal but with the particular and, in this sense, it is subjective. On the other hand, being faced with an object that it does not create, whose materiality is opposed to the activity of the spirit, science is in a condition of passivity typical of religion.

Instead of combining the subjectivity of art with the objectivity of religion, as philosophy does, science thus remains at their level of abstraction, which cannot be overcome except in the self-consciousness of the spiritual act, the only one where subject and object concretely coexist.

Gentile rejects the accusation of &quot;hostility to science&quot;. To the contrary, he claims to share the desire, proper to a scientific mind, to overcome every limit that is considered inviolable by thought, a desire that finds its foundation in the &quot;fruitfulness&quot; of a philosophy such as the actualist one.

Because actualism denies the existence of immutable realities that oppose thought, every limit to free human creativity falls in the technico-scientific direction.

=== Ethics and politics ===
Since the divine is immanent to the human, even on the ethical level, the spirit must be affirmed not as an empty universality that suppresses individuality, but as the concrete overcoming of particular interests in a superior ethics that includes them all and at the same time realizes them.

In this sense, Gentile presents himself as &quot;more liberal than Wilson and more socialist than Lenin&quot; (&quot;più liberale di Wilson e più socialista di Lenin, certamente&quot;), defending a human liberty understood as the capacity to universalize oneself by going beyond the limits of one&#x27;s own empirical singularity. Gentile rejects the distinction made by Croce between economics and ethics, which, taken individually, remain at the stage of unattainable abstractions, in order to integrate them into a synthesis in which both find their concreteness in action, represented by . The State is conceived by Gentile as a living organism in which individuals express themselves and discover their raison d&#x27;être; a state that does not set itself as a fixed and binding goal, but understood dynamically as a constant process of integration and renewal of spiritual life, as Gentile saw embodied by fascism.

In view of a reform of ethics and of the national conscience of which Actualism would have constituted the foundations, he motivated his adherence to Fascism by honouring himself as its official philosopher.

== Reception ==

Actual idealism was successful in that it promoted a theory of regarding thought, that garnered enough attention to be a competitor to the new waves of positivism, and therefore materialist conceptions of social life that were vying for reformist tendencies in the politics of the time. Its ideas were key to helping the National Fascist Party consolidate power in Italy with its own reform, and integral to giving fascism the content of its philosophical sentiment. Despite this, Gentile claimed actual idealism to be the true form of positivism, and the proper interpretation of the concept of positivism.

== Criticism ==
Benedetto Croce objected that Gentile&#x27;s &quot;pure act&quot; is nothing other than Schopenhauer&#x27;s will. However Schopenhauer &quot;…came to rest in an Absolute which transcends concrete experience … and for (Schopenhauer) the Critical Philosophy was only a prolegomena or propaedeutic to a speculative or &#x27;transcendent&#x27; philosophy of the kind which Gentile and Kant are united in opposing&quot;, according to H. S. Harris&#x27;s book on the basic metaphysics of Giovanni Gentile in contrast to that of Schopenhauer.

With actualism, Gentile reforms Hegelian dialectic based on the spiritualist motives of the Italian ontological tradition, reconciling them with the needs of concrete character of Marxist thought. He thus takes to Spaventa and Marx the reference models to reinterpret Hegel, proceeding to one of his &quot;kantianizations&quot;, but avoiding falling into materialism.

An opponent of all intellectualism, which he considered detached from reality, he succeeded in postulating a theory of speculative thought that would obtain sufficient consensus to compete with the new waves of positivism (and thus of materialist conceptions of social life) that were clashing in the field of reformist political trends of the time. In 1921, Piero Gobetti wrote of Gentile that he &quot;brought philosophy down from the professorial obscurities into the concreteness of life&quot;. However, unlike Benedetto Croce, who permeates Italian culture in general, Gentile had an impact on the specifically philosophical milieu of his time.

His ideas, historically, are decisive for the consolidation of power of the National Fascist Party in Italy, providing a dogmatic basis for relative reforms, as well as the real driving force of the Fascist philosophical doctrine, tending towards the construction of a new humanity. Nevertheless, Gentile claims for his actualism the quintessential quality of positivism, of which it would constitute only the most correct interpretation.

With his conception idealist, Gentile intends to become a prophet of the spirit, a priest of an immanent divinity that religion wrongly considers transcendent, devoid of limits and imperfections. This concept, however, enters a crisis at the end of World War II, when new philosophical paradigms based on existentialism and individualistic presuppositions impose themselves. Nicola Abbagnano, although a bearer of these new philosophical instances, exalted Gentile&#x27;s differences between Gentile&#x27;s philosophy and the idealism of Benedetto Croce, emphasizing at the same time the strongly romanticism roots from which Gentile&#x27;s actualism draws.

Similarly, according to Leo Valiani, &quot;his philosophy seems anachronistic to us. The evolution of societies and sciences has made it even more anachronistic than it already was. The link between thinking and doing, the problem of the active character of knowledge, which is at the center of Gentile&#x27;s meditations, is nevertheless an eternal problem, which survives the particular approach he gave it&quot;.

Among Gentile&#x27;s most faithful disciples is Ugo Spirito, who defends the immanentism of his philosophy, to the point of reconciling it, after a long philosophical journey, with a vision that elevates science to the rank of cornerstone of the contemporary age. If other thinkers find in Marxism a natural outlet for his immanentism, there are those who, more attentive to the religious and spiritualist motives of his thought, claim the need to open up to transcendence, in particular the idealist Augusto Guzzo, or in the Catholic sphere, Armando Carlini, Michele Federico Sciacca and Augusto del Noce.

Recently, the philosopher Emanuele Severino is keen to highlight &quot;the essential solidarity between actualism and techno-science; on the other hand, the capacity of actualism to carry over the entire Western tradition: this means that Gentile&#x27;s thought is destined to be recognized as one of the most decisive features of world culture&quot;.

<text>Sligo Airport is located in Strandhill, County Sligo, west of Sligo, at the end of the R277 road, in Ireland. The airport is a small regional airport and has had no scheduled routes since 2011. It is the home of the Sligo Aero Club (a Registered Training Facility) and the northwest base for the Irish Coastguard. Private flight training, skydiving and charity jumps are all operated from the airport. In 2002 a Euroceltic Airways Fokker F27 aircraft carrying the band Aslan overshot the runway and the nose dipped into the sea. The accident caused no casualties.

==History==
The first commercial service, Sligo to Dublin, began on 4 July 1983, operated by Avair. 

As of 2002, Euroceltic was operating the Government of Ireland public service obligation subsidy scheme for the route to Dublin. The airline collapsed shortly afterwards and Aer Arann operated the route for the remainder of the contract. The 2005 contract tender was offered to Loganair who declined it. Aer Arann subsequently negotiated the operation of the contract with the Government. 

On 21 February 2007 the Irish Government announced that it would be giving €8.5 million to the airport in capital grant money, to upgrade the runway and add approach lighting and safety enhancements. However, the proposed runway extension would have required infill and the erection of gantries across part of the adjacent protected beach. The plan drew much local criticism and almost 400 objections from residents of the local area, fisheries groups, the Department of Environment, An Taisce and Birdwatch Ireland. The planning permission was quashed on the third attempt by a high court judge on justification grounds.

Until the end of 2008 Aer Arann operated flights to Manchester Airport. In 2011 the airport lost its only scheduled route, operated by Aer Arann, to Dublin Airport twice daily. The final flight was on 21 July 2011.

The Irish Government-commissioned Value for Money Review of Exchequer Funding on the Regional Airports Programme recommended the ending of operational subvention to the airport and the ending of the PSO designation, citing poor performance, growing operational costs and development of alternative transport connections to the region.

Since the end of passenger flights in 2011, the airport has continued to be a base for the Irish Coast Guard Rescue Helicopter (Rescue 118). General aviation also operates at the airport, including aircraft such as Cessnas, Pipers, and Beechcraft. Sligo Aero Club continues to operate from the airport. The airport receives occasional visits from jets which are suited to land on the shorter runway.

==CHC Ireland Search-and-Rescue base==
Sligo Airport is the home of Rescue 118, the Irish Coast Guard Helicopter which has served the north-west of Ireland since 2004. The base operates a Sikorsky S-92A helicopter 24 hours, 365 days a year (which replaced the previously used S-61N on 1 July 2013). It deals with many types of incidents, such as cliff rescues, hospital transfers and dealing with sick patients off coastal islands.

==Accidents and incidents==
Like airports such as Gibraltar and Funchal, Sligo has a lack of safety margin for undershoots and overshoots because the peninsula upon which the airport is situated is less than long. On 2 November 2002, a Euroceltic Fokker F-27 (registered G-ECAT) was coming in to land, after a routine flight from Dublin, when it overran the runway. After landing nosewheel first almost halfway down the runway, the aircraft eventually came to rest with the nose of the aircraft in the sea, and the main landing gear on an embankment. Passengers were evacuated and there were no reported casualties. However the plane was declared a write-off by the company two weeks later, due to the saltwater damage to the cockpit. The cause of the accident was a &quot;fast, low approach, leading to the aircraft landing late, beyond the normal touch down point, thereby making it impossible to stop the aircraft on the remaining runway available&quot;. The pilot at the time had been placed under restrictions following a CAA audit of Euroceltic, as noted in paragraph 1.18.2 of the AAIU report. The chief pilot of Euroceltic &quot;was using an instructor tone and coaching&quot; the pilot during landing, as noted in paragraph 2.1 of the report. The AAIU report also notes in paragraph 2.1 that &quot;Whilst the meteorological conditions were difficult they were well within the limits for the type of approach and there was very little crosswind component&quot; and in paragraph 2.2 that &quot;there was no significant standing water on the runway during the landing&quot;.

<doc id="901729" wikidata="Q666123" url="?curid=901729" title="A52 motorway (Switzerland)">
<text>The A52 is a main road () (American English: &quot;Expressway&quot;) connecting Zumikon in the canton of Zürich with Hinwil and Rapperswil-Jona in the canton of St. Gallen.

== Route ==
The A52 starts out from the intersection with Zumikon and Küsnacht. It passes through Zumikon and Forch before heading for Egg, Esslingen and finally Hinwil. Near Hinwil, there is a huge expressway-class roundabout with three different roads connecting to Rapperswil-Jona, Hinwil and again back to Zumikon and Forch. It finishes in Rüthi and Jona SG.

An &quot;Autostrasse&quot; is the Swiss equivalent of a major rural British &quot;A&quot; road. Portions of the road are nearly like a motorway or American expressway (without the central reservation) with very short entrance and exit sliproads (ramps), with two lanes going in each direction, making it four in all. Possibly due to this, the road is often surprisingly smooth to travel on.

The A52 is also referred to as the Forchstrasse (Forch Road) as it is a continuation of the Forchstrasse in a main road form.

It runs in a southeast-to-east direction before the Hinwil crossing, continuing south toward Rapperswil after the intersection.

&quot;Main route:&quot; Zumikon - Forch - Egg - Esslingen - Hinwil - Rüthi - Rapperswil

== Restrictions ==
&quot;Speed limit:&quot; at start in Zumikon, then and progressively . The Hinwil roundabout has a speed limit of 80 km/h.

&quot;Tolls:&quot; no toll/vignette required.

<doc id="901730" wikidata="Q202693" url="?curid=901730" title="Jo Nesbø">
<text>Jon &quot;Jo&quot; Nesbø (; born 29 March 1960) is a Norwegian writer, musician, and former football player and reporter. More than 3 million copies of his novels had been sold in Norway as of March 2014, and he had sold over 50 million copies worldwide by 2021, making him the most successful Norwegian author of all time. His work has been translated into more than 50 languages.

Known primarily for his crime novels featuring Inspector Harry Hole, Nesbø is also the main vocalist and songwriter for the Norwegian rock band Di Derre. In 2007 he released his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Doktor Proktors Prompepulver&quot; (English translation: &quot;Doctor Proctor&#x27;s Fart Powder&quot;). The 2011 film &quot;Headhunters&quot; is based on Nesbø&#x27;s novel &quot;Hodejegerne (The Headhunters)&quot;.

==Early life==
Jon Nesbø was born in Oslo on 29 March 1960 and grew up in Molde. He graduated from the Norwegian School of Economics with a degree in economics and business administration. He worked as a freelance journalist and stockbroker before he began his writing career.

==Career==
===The Harry Hole series===
The series follows Harry Hole, a tough detective working for Crime Squad and later with the National Criminal Investigation Service, whose investigations take him from Norway to numerous other countries. Hole takes on seemingly unconnected cases, sometimes found to involve serial killers, bank robbers, gangsters, or the establishment, but spends a significant amount of time battling alcoholism and his own personal demons.

The Harry Hole novels are multi-layered, violent, and often feature women in peril, as typified by &quot;The Snowman&quot;. On the return of Harry Hole in &quot;The Thirst&quot;, Nesbø said: &quot;I was always coming back to Harry; he is my soul mate. But it is a dark soul, so it is – as always – both a thrill and a chilling, emotionally exhausting experience. But Harry and the story make it worth the sleepless nights.&quot;

A film adaptation of &quot;The Snowman&quot;, with Tomas Alfredson directing (replacing Martin Scorsese, who executive produced), and starring Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, and Charlotte Gainsbourg, premiered in October 2017.

A television adaptation &quot;Jo Nesbø&#x27;s Detective Hole&quot; began filming in Oslo in 2024.

===The Doctor Proctor series===
&quot;Doctor Proctor&#x27;s Fart Powder&quot;, originally published in 2007, was Nesbø&#x27;s first children&#x27;s book. They are illustrated by Mike Lowery. The series is set in Oslo and follows the story of Doctor Proctor, a crazy professor waiting for his big break, his next-door neighbour Lisa and her peculiar friend Nilly, a short redheaded boy. The ruthless twins Truls and Trym Thrane sometimes lurk in the background. Doctor Proctor&#x27;s first major inventions are a powder that makes the user fart (and the farts don&#x27;t smell) and the &quot;Fartonaut Powder,&quot; which makes the user fart so powerfully that they blast into space. In book 2 he invents a bathtub that allows the user to travel through time. As of 2018, there are 5 books in the series.

In 2014, a live-action film adaptation of the first book was made, and is only available in Norwegian. A sequel, &quot;Doktor Proktors Tidsbadekar&quot;, was released in 2015 with German involvement. Both films received mixed reviews.

===The Olav Johansen series===
It was announced in October 2013 that, writing under the pen-name of Tom Johansen, Nesbø had written at least two novels provisionally entitled &quot;Blood on Snow&quot; and &quot;More Blood on the Water&quot;, scheduled to be published in autumn 2014 and spring 2015. The books &quot;Blood on Snow&quot; and its sequel &quot;Midnight Sun: Blood on Snow 2&quot; were published in 2015, but under Jo Nesbø&#x27;s name.

It was also announced in October 2013 that Warner Brothers had bought the rights to &quot;Blood on Snow&quot; and planned to make a screen adaptation, to be produced by and possibly starring Leonardo DiCaprio. However, on 4 April 2017, it was reported that the screen rights had been purchased by Tobey Maguire&#x27;s Material Pictures and Lawrence Grey&#x27;s Grey Matter Productions, and that Maguire would make his directorial debut on the projected film adaptation.

This series follows Olav Johansen, a fixer for Oslo crime boss Daniel Hoffman. In &quot;Blood on Snow&quot;, Olav has just found the woman of his dreams. The only problem is that she&#x27;s his boss&#x27;s wife and that his boss has hired him to kill her.

A film adaptation of &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;, titled &quot;The Hanging Sun&quot;, directed by Francesco Carrozzini directing and starring Alessandro Borghi, Jessica Brown Findlay, Sam Spruell, Peter Mullan and Charles Dance, premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival in September 2022.

===Other projects===
In 2011, the Nesbø story &quot;Twelve&quot; was adapted by Magnus Martens into the film &quot;Jackpot&quot; (), a black comedy crime mystery film.

In 2014 it was announced that Nesbø would contribute a re-telling of the story of &quot;Macbeth&quot; as part of the Hogarth Shakespeare project, described as a &#x27;crime noir&#x27; version of the tragedy. His &quot;Macbeth&quot; is set in 1970 in an unspecified location that combines aspects of Scandinavia and Scotland, and involves an Inspector Macbeth of a paramilitary SWAT team targeting bikers, drug dealers, and his police colleagues. It was published in April 2018.

In 2016, it was announced that there are also plans to adapt his stand-alone novel, &quot;Sønnen&quot; (&quot;The Son&quot;), as a film, to be directed by Denis Villeneuve, with Jake Gyllenhaal as producer and Channing Tatum in the lead role.

On 5 April 2017, it was announced that Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur was working on a new adaptation of &quot;I Am Victor&quot;, a short story by Nesbø previously planned as an NBC television series but not completed.

==Other work==
Nesbø played as a striker for the football team Molde FK until he was forced to give up his football career upon tearing the cruciate ligaments in his knee.

<doc id="901733" wikidata="Q4930861" url="?curid=901733" title="Blyth Navigation">
<text>The Blyth Navigation was a canal in Suffolk, England, running from Halesworth to the North Sea at Southwold. It opened in 1761, and was insolvent by 1884. Its demise was accelerated by an attempt to reclaim saltings at Blythburgh, which resulted in the estuary silting up. It was used sporadically until 1911, and was not formally abandoned until 1934.

==History==
Between Southwold and Walberswick, the mouth of the River Blyth forms a tidal creek, which opens out into a large area of saltings below the first bridge over the river at Blythburgh. The river was navigable to the port of Blythburgh until the 16th century, but navigation was increasingly affected by silting up of the channel. The volume of water which drained from the saltings on every tide kept the mouth of the river scoured, and enabled Southwold to develop as an important, though minor, port.

The idea of making the river navigable beyond Blythburgh was proposed by Thomas Knights in the 1740s. Knights was a brewer from Halesworth, and suggested that Southwold harbour needed to be improved first. An act of Parliament, the Southwold Harbour Act 1746 (20 Geo. 2. c. 14), was obtained to authorise the improvements, which were sufficiently successful that harbour dues more than doubled over the next five years. Knights tried to gain more support for a navigation to Halesworth, and a plan for the navigation, including a branch from Halesworth to Ubbeston was prepared by Benjamin Reeve in 1753. The project which included three locks was costed at £4,614 by John Reynolds in May 1753, but there was a delay before the bill was submitted to Parliament.
Following the granting of the (30 Geo. 2. c. 47) on 1 April 1757, which included additional powers for the Southwold Harbour trustees, a new survey was carried out by Langley Edwards, who estimated the cost at £3,000, which included the purchase of Wenhaston watermill. By 1759, subscriptions had been received from 38 people, mainly from the immediate locality, for a total of £3,600. Having made the estimate, Edwards was responsible for completing the work to that price, but failed to attend most of the meetings which the commissioners called. Despite his elusiveness, the work was completed at a cost of £3,822, and the official opening took place on 23 July 1761.

===Operation===
As built, the navigation had four locks while some sources also mention a tidal staunch located above Blythburgh bridge. Southwold Museum show two sections where the winding river channel was bypassed by a new straighter cut, one above Blythburgh bridge and one below, with several minor cuts to remove meanders. They place the tidal staunch just below Blyford bridge, and only show three further locks between there and Halesworth. Their map is based on surveys carried out in 1821 and 1840. Ordnance Survey maps show a lock around below Blyford bridge, which prevents tides from passing further upstream, a second just above Blyford bridge, a third just upstream of Wenhaston railway bridge, allowing the navigation to bypass Wenhaston corn mill, and a fourth at the start of the New Reach in Halesworth. Earlier 6-inch maps show an additional lock at Mells Bridge, then called Old Chapel Bridge.

From the sea, the navigation followed the River Blyth until it reached the Town River, which it followed to Halesworth Lock. From there, the New Reach took the canal to a wharf at Halesworth, which formed the terminus of the canal. The New Reach joined back up with the Town River a little further to the west, in order to provide the water supply for the locks. The locks were built to allow wherries to use the navigation, and so were . However, they were unusual, in that the side walls curved outwards in the centre, to provide an extra of width. So that wherries could reach his maltings, a local maltster named Patrick Stead increased the water levels above the point where the New Reach and the Town River joined, by building an additional lock near the junction.

The day-to-day running of the navigation for the first four years was the responsibility of Samuel Jones, who appears to have overseen the construction of the navigation while Langley Edwards was elsewhere, and who was appointed as lock keeper, toll collector, warehouse keeper and surveyor of works by the commissioners. Each time his contract was to be renewed, they attempted to reduce his salary, and so he left and was replaced by his assistant William Bickers. Tolls over the next thirty years averaged £134 per year

===Demise===
In the early 19th century, the saltings below Blythburgh Bridge were reclaimed by the construction of embankments, to prevent them flooding. The plan was poorly thought out, and soon afterwards the condition of Southwold harbour was deteriorating, largely due to the deposition of silt, which made access difficult. The canal engineer John Rennie was asked to advise on a course of action, but although his report of 6 January 1820 pointed to the embanking of the saltings as the cause of the problem, he could offer no acceptable solution. The entrance to the harbour became blocked in 1839, and a further report was prepared by John Wright and James Walker in 1840. They calculated that the embankments surrounding the saltings excluded 5.5 million cubic yards (4.2 million m3) of tidal water on each tide, and thus the scouring effect of the river was considerably reduced.

1879 saw the opening of the Southwold Railway, a narrow gauge line between Southwold and Halesworth, which crossed the navigation near Southwold on a swing bridge. Although lack of capital prevented the construction of a branch from the main line to the navigation at Halesworth and another along the north bank of the river towards Southwold harbour, the railway still had an effect on the navigation, use of which declined until the commissioners advertised that they were no longer deriving any income from it in 1884, and would therefore cease to maintain it. In 1894 the commissioners voted to ask the Board of Trade for a warrant to allow the navigation to be abandoned. Despite this, a trader from Halesworth called Fred Lambert brought a wherry called &quot;Star&quot; to the river, and carried coal from the harbour at Southwold to Halesworth until 1911. He estimated that the cost of repairing the navigation was £1,000, but he could not raise the money to carry out the work.
The Southwold Railway finally built a branch to the harbour in 1914, as part of a plan to relieve congestion of the harbours at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft during the herring fishing season. The outbreak of war prevented its use for this purpose, although it was useful when coastal defences were being built in the area. The harbour declined until it was sold back to the Southwold Corporation in 1932, while the navigation finally ceased on 19 February 1934, when an order of abandonment, the (SR&amp;O 1934/283), was obtained under section 41 of the Land Drainage Act 1930.

==Remains==
The swing bridge which carried the railway over the river was widened in 1907, and was removed at the outbreak of World War II. It has since been replaced by a fixed Bailey bridge to provide access on foot to Walberswick. With the demise of the locks, the river levels have fallen, so that it is difficult to imagine that wherries once reached Halesworth. The embankments enclosing the saltings below Blythburgh have been breached, and once more a large inland lake forms when the tide is high. Southwold harbour is used for moorings, and can accommodate 110 boats, while navigation is still possible to Blythburgh, although the Bailey bridge restricts access to smaller boats.

The New Reach in Halesworth has an unusual status. In 1968, Wilfred George the owner of the maltings at the end of the navigation registered the waterway as a village green. The designated area ran from the point at which the New Reach leaves the Town River, just above Maltings Lock, to Halesworth Lock. It includes part of the towpath, and the spur which enabled wherries to reach the maltings from Langleys Quay, which subsequently became a tarmac footpath. In 1993 a community group was set up to turn the New Reach into a resource for the town, but frustration at the difficulties of negotiating water levels and flooding in that year let to the plans being dropped. The section is owned by Waveney District Council.

There have been sporadic efforts to restore the canal for navigation, but the resultant flooding of bordering land has made this unpopular. On 27 May 2016, Gerald Burns canoed from Halesworth to Southwold, carrying a sack of malt in his boat, which he delivered to Adnams Brewery in Southwold. The purpose of the journey was to raise funds for the restoration of New Reach at Halesworth, which played an important part in the industrial history of the town. The New Reach Working Group was formed, and in 2017 launched a working punt named after the maltster Partick Stead. In 2018 they were given a powered brush cutter to assist in maintaining the waterway by the Ipswich Branch of the Inland Waterways Association.

<text>Zhou () were historical administrative and political divisions of China. Formally established during the Han dynasty, &quot;zhou&quot; existed continuously for over 2000 years . &quot;Zhou&quot; were also once used in Korea (, &quot;ju&quot;), Vietnam () and .

==Overview==
&quot;Zhou&quot; is typically rendered by several terms in the English language:

* The large &quot;zhou&quot; before the Tang dynasty and in countries other than China are called &quot;provinces&quot;
* The smaller &quot;zhou&quot; during and after the Tang dynasty are called &quot;prefectures&quot;
* The &quot;zhou&quot; of the Qing dynasty are also called either &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;dependent departments&quot;, depending on their level.

The Tang dynasty also established &quot;fǔ&quot; (, &quot;prefectures&quot;), &quot;zhou&quot; of special importance such as capitals and other major cities. By the Ming and Qing, became predominant divisions within Chinese provinces. In Ming and Qing, the word &quot;fǔ&quot; () was typically attached to the name of each prefecture&#x27;s capital city, thus both Chinese and Western maps and geographical works would often call the respective cities Hangzhou-fu, Wenzhou-fu, Wuchang-fu, etc.

After the Meiji Restoration, &quot;fu&quot; was also used in Japanese for the urban prefectures of the most important cities; today, it is still used in the Japanese names for the Osaka and Kyoto Prefectures.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, &quot;zhou&quot; today exists only in the designation &quot;autonomous prefecture&quot; (), administrative areas for China&#x27;s designated minorities. However, &quot;zhou&quot; have left a huge mark on Chinese place names, including the province of Guizhou and the major cities of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Lanzhou, and Suzhou, among many others. Likewise, although modern Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese provinces are no longer designated by &quot;zhou&quot; cognates, the older terms survive in various place names, notably the Japanese islands of Honshu and Kyushu, the Korean province Jeju-do, and Lai Châu in Vietnam.

==History==
&quot;Zhou&quot; were first mentioned in ancient Chinese texts, notably the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; or &quot;Tribute of Yu&quot;, section of the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;. All agreed on the division of China into nine &quot;zhou&quot;, though they differed on their names and position. These &quot;zhou&quot; were geographical concepts, not administrative entities.

The Han dynasty was the first to formalize the &quot;zhou&quot; into actual administrative divisions by establishing 13 &quot;zhou&quot; all across China. Because these &quot;zhou&quot; were the largest divisions of the China at the time, they are usually translated as &quot;provinces&quot;. After the Han dynasty, however, the number of &quot;zhou&quot; began to increase. By the time of the Sui dynasty, there were over a hundred &quot;zhou&quot; all across China.

The Sui and Tang dynasties merged &quot;zhou&quot; with the next level down, the commanderies or (). The Tang also added another level on top: the circuit or (). Henceforth, &quot;zhou&quot; were lowered to second-level status, and the word becomes translated into English as &quot;prefecture&quot;. Thereafter, &quot;zhou&quot; continued to survive as second- or third-level political divisions until the Qing dynasty.

 The People&#x27;s Republic of China recycled the name, using it to refer to the autonomous prefectures granted to various ethnicities.

<doc id="901738" wikidata="Q5286863" url="?curid=901738" title="Dobroyd Head">
<text>Dobroyd Head is a point or headland in the Northern Beaches local government area, in the suburb of Balgowlah Heights, New South Wales, Australia. It is part of the Sydney Harbour National Park, which contains examples of ecosystems at risk such as coastal heath. Tania Park is located to the immediate north-east, and contains the 2MWM 90.3 transmitter. There is a lookout sited on the headland named after Arabanoo, the first Aboriginal man to live among European settlers who was captured in Manly Cove in 1788.

==History==

In January 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip noted Aboriginal people living in caves at what is now Wellings Reserve, Balgowlah Heights, and there are a number of Aboriginal sites recorded in the area, including a midden at Reef Beach, which was partly eroded by a storm in May 1974, when human remains were exposed. What is now Dobroyd Head was originally named &quot;Dobroyd Point&quot; (which is now the name of a locality in Haberfield in the Inner West) by Simeon Lord (1771–1840), a landowner in the district in the early 19th century. Dobroyd Castle, its namesake, was the home of his mother, Ann Fielden, prior to her marriage in 1764. On his death in 1840, he gifted the land to the Crown, with a stipulation that the name must be kept.

In 1871, the Secretary for Lands, Bowie Wilson, set aside the area of 100 hectares comprising the Dobroyd headland as a defence reserve, but excluded all privately owned lands, such as Reef Beach, Forty Baskets Beach, Grotto Point, Castle Rock and Clontarf. On 14 August 1874, prominent surveyor and hydrographer, Commander John Thomas Ewing Gowlland was drowned in an accident off the headland. In August 1963 the Manly, Warringah and Pittwater Historical Society unveiled a plaque at Dobroyd Head commemorating him. In 1914, the government steamer, &quot;SS Kate&quot;, was struck and sunk by the Manly ferry &quot;Bellubera&quot; off the headland. The Dobroyd Scenic Drive, funded by the council, was opened in 1938 by Manly mayor Percy Nolan.

Between 1923 and 1963, various small cabins and shacks were built around Crater Cove on the headland, they were for use as weekenders and retreats and remained occupied until the 1980s.

Various subdivisions for the development of Balgowlah Heights occurred throughout the next 80 years until in 1959–1960, when Manly Council learned that land near Cutler Road and Tabalum Road was to be subdivided and objected to any development and sale of land below Cutler Road. This movement to preserve the lands of Dobroyd Head for public recreation was led by alderman Frank Preacher, and on 17 October 1960, Lands Minister Jack Renshaw met representatives of Manly Council on the site. Renshaw later approved the removal of these lands from the sale of land and transferred responsibility for its preservation to Manly council. In 1975, responsibilities changed again when the area was proclaimed as part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. A 2015 article in the &quot;Manly Daily&quot; later revealed that Manly Council had voted in June 1997 to erect a plaque to honour Renshaw, alderman Preacher and Manly Council&#x27;s role in the preservation of the headland, but no action has since been taken to carry it out.

<text>The Bat (, &quot;Bat Man&quot;) is a 1997 crime novel by Norwegian writer Jo Nesbø, the first in the Harry Hole series.

==Plot==
Norwegian police officer Harry Hole is sent to Sydney, Australia to work with Australian police investigating the murder of a young Norwegian woman residing in Australia, Inger Holter. Her boyfriend, Evans White, is initially approached as a suspect. Hole is assisted by Aboriginal colleague Andrew Kensington; together they find out that they are dealing with a serial killer who strangles blonde women. As the story becomes more complex, Hole struggles to find the killer and falls deeper into alcoholism.

==Translation status==
This is the first of the Harry Hole novels, introducing the character, but it was very late in being translated to English. The British and American publishers chose to start by translating the later books, set in Oslo, and only after these became very popular came around to publishing the first book, set in Australia.

This order of publication caused an unintended spoiler, as Harry&#x27;s reminiscences in a later book—published earlier in English—included the name and specific characteristics of the murderer in &quot;The Bat&quot;. 

The second book, &quot;Cockroaches&quot;, set in Thailand, has been translated to English, fifteen years after being originally published in Norwegian, and was published in the UK in November 2013.

==Critical notes==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; states that &quot;It’s an unusual debut since the very first page finds Harry clearing passport control in Sydney, half a world away from his native Oslo... Harry is already every bit as volcanic as in his later cases. The big difference is Australia, which Nesbø, seeing it through the eyes of both a tourist and a cultural pathologist, makes you wonder how much different it is from Norway after all.&quot;

Andy Hoban of &quot;Sunday Express&quot; gave a rating of 5/5 and noted &quot;Nesbo’s principal characters are both credible and well-drawn and it is fantastic to see a younger Harry, a more loquacious Harry. The Bat explains some of what burdens and drives him in the later books. So for anyone new to Nesbo, you are in for a treat if you follow Harry’s career beginning with this book. For me, the biggest insult to Nesbo was to see him advertised as “the next Stieg Larsson” when in fact The Bat was written eight years before The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Still, now I can dig out the rest of the series and read them again, in order.&quot;

<doc id="901744" wikidata="Q1782330" url="?curid=901744" title="Harry Hole">
<text>Harry Hole (the surname pronounced as &quot;HOO-leh&quot;), who is also called &quot;Harry Holy&quot; (strictly the first novel) by allies in the Australian police force, is the main character in a series of crime novels written by Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. The name is derived from Old Norse &quot;Hólar&quot;, the plural form of &quot;hóll&quot;, meaning &quot;round and isolated hill.&quot; Harry&#x27;s surname is also the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway) with a heritage that goes back to the Viking Age.

In his stories, Hole is a brilliant, introverted, and obsessively driven detective. He has few friends and often clashes with colleagues, but his work and skill are so widely known and respected that he is considered a specialist, leading him to sometimes consult on cases in other cities and countries. Throughout the novels, he sometimes uses unorthodox and illegal methods in his investigations. A common focus of the novel series is Hole&#x27;s struggles with alcoholism and depression, as well as how his mental health suffers as a result of his morally questionable actions and the brutal nature of the crimes he investigates. The novel series eventually shows Hole recognizing the harmful nature of his work and increasingly problematic behavior, prompting him to leave the police force. Despite this, later novels show Hole continually finding reason to return to Oslo and assist new criminal investigations, despite his own initial reluctance and the protests of his loved ones.

Critics liken the personality of Harry Hole to those of the famous literary detectives such as Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Jules Maigret, and Nero Wolfe. According to Jo Nesbø himself, the character is inspired by and a tribute to Michael Connelly&#x27;s character Harry Bosch. The novels are frequent bestsellers.

==Character==
Harry Hole is introduced in &quot;The Bat&quot; as a police officer with the Oslo Crime Squad. Born in 1965, Harry&#x27;s mother, a descendant of the Sami people, dies due to cancer while he is in his twenties. Harry never has a close relationship with his father Olav, a former teacher, but is deeply attached to his younger sister Søs, who has Down syndrome. Taxi driver Øystein Eikeland is an old school friend of Harry&#x27;s and one of the few people he is close to. Introverted and prone to depression, Hole is a chain-smoker alcoholic when first introduced, though he later recognizes his addiction and is considered a recovering alcoholic in later books. His encounters with assassins, corruption, and serial killers throughout the novels often strengthen his cynical views and his desire to escape reminders of his experiences and traumas.

Harry Hole&#x27;s home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett, located in the author&#x27;s own home city of Oslo. Many of the stories involve extensive background details and descriptions of real locations such as the actual Oslo Police Department headquarters. Hole regularly interacts with city residents and immigrants from a variety of ethnic and social backgrounds. Many of the novels feature his favorite &quot;watering hole,&quot; Restaurant Schrøder (Schrøder&#x27;s, for short) in St. Hanshaugen.

Along with standard police training, Hole undertakes specialized training in interrogation techniques and firearms at the FBI. His problematic and often unsocial behavior, as well as his obsessive tendencies during investigations, brings him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues. Bjarne Møller, head of the Oslo Police Department, often shields Hole from being fired, believing he is a brilliant detective and vital to certain investigations. This repeated protection results in Harry feeling loyal and close to Møller. Others in the police department whom he comes to trust as friends include Beate Lønn and Bjørn Holm (both in the forensics division), Katrine Bratt (a Bergen detective who helps secure specialist information), and Gunnar Hagen (Harry&#x27;s former senior officer prior to &quot;Phantom&quot;). Hole&#x27;s skills become renowned enough that he is considered a specialist, leading him to be sought for occasional consultation by authorities in other cities and countries. In the first novel, &quot;The Bat&quot;, he travels to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police (who refer to him as &quot;Harry Holy&quot;). In the second novel, &quot;Cockroaches&quot;, he is called to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador.

Outside of the department, Hole develops a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke. Her son from a previous relationship, Oleg, comes to view Harry as a father figure, sometimes calling him &quot;dad.&quot; After the seventh novel, &quot;The Snowman&quot;, Harry&#x27;s relationship with Rakel suffers. This, along with recent trauma, compels Hole to leave Oslo and the police force. The next novel &quot;The Leopard&quot; shows Harry living in self-imposed exile in Hong Kong. Kaja Solness, a new Norwegian Crime Squad officer, asks him to return to Oslo to help investigate a possible serial killing. Learning his father Olav is also ill and likely to soon die, Hole agrees to help and returns to Oslo. During the story, Olav asks his son to assist in his suicide in order to end his pain, but Harry cannot bring himself to do so. At the end of the book, Harry has a brief reunion with Rakel before then visiting the imprisoned killer of &quot;The Snowman&quot;. It is implied that Harry then aids in the criminal&#x27;s own suicide. Disturbed by his recent experiences, Harry determines to return to Hong Kong for good.

The next book &quot;Phantom&quot; depicts Harry returning to Oslo yet again some time later, this time because Rakel&#x27;s son Oleg has been arrested for murder. Harry finds out the truth behind the murder, but is then shot and the book ends without clarifying if he will survive or not. Harry is revealed to be alive and living again in Oslo in the tenth novel &quot;Police.&quot; Deciding his obsessive pursuit of criminals has cost him too much, he now lectures at the Police College and resumes a relationship with Rakel. A series of killings leads his former colleagues to seek him out for help. Following these events, Harry marries Rakel and legally adopts Oleg as his son. He promises he is done with police work, but finds himself drawn into another investigation in the following novel &quot;The Thirst.&quot;

<text>Tranz Am is an action video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game that was released for the ZX Spectrum in July 1983. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic version of the United States and centres around a racing car driver on his quest to obtain the Eight Great Cups of Ultimate, which are scattered throughout the country.

The game was written by Chris Stamper and graphics were designed by Tim Stamper. &quot;Tranz Am&quot; was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing instant loading of the game (the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes). The game received mostly positive reviews upon release: praise was given to the game&#x27;s graphics and simple controls, while criticism was directed at its confusing interface.

==Gameplay==

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic United States in the year 3472. Eight Great Cups of Ultimate are dispersed around America, and the player&#x27;s mission is to obtain all of them. Petrol is in short supply and the only way to re-fuel vehicles is to find petrol pumps, scattered across the country.

The game is presented in a top-down perspective and involves driving around America to collect the eight trophies whilst avoiding natural hazards and kamikaze cars, which attempt to crash into the player. The player has a limited supply of petrol and must collect fuel at regular intervals by driving over petrol pumps. Obstacles include trees, boulders and destroyed buildings. The overworld has an invisible border which causes the player&#x27;s car to reverse automatically to ensure that they do not cross the game&#x27;s boundaries.

The interface displays a list of comprehensive data: a map showing a list of key cities in the contiguous United States, petrol gauge, speedometer, remaining lives, number of cups collected, short-range radar and engine temperature. Every key city in the game contains at least one petrol station. If the player drives too fast for too long, their car will overheat and slow down. To save an overheating car the player must drive below a certain speed or stop entirely to allow the engine to cool.

==Development==

&quot;Tranz Am&quot; is one of the few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing &quot;instantaneous&quot; loading of the game when the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes. The game can also run on the 16K version of the Spectrum.

==Reception==

The game received a mostly positive reception upon release. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; praised the game&#x27;s controls and accessibility, stating that they were &quot;easy to get into&quot; upon the first try. A reviewer writing for &quot;Home Computing Weekly&quot; found the game to be &quot;compulsive&quot; overall, but noted that the game did not live up to the promises made by the description on the packaging. Simon Lane of &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; praised the game&#x27;s graphics, sound and presentation, stating that they were of &quot;a very high quality&quot; and that &quot;Tranz Am&quot; was an &quot;original game&quot; in comparison with the other games released by Ultimate. Lane criticised the game&#x27;s interface, however, stating that he found it difficult to &quot;concentrate on everything all at once&quot;. Lane also added that the game did not reward the player enough for collecting all of the cups, displaying just a short congratulation message before inviting him or her to begin again. A reviewer writing for &quot;Your Computer&quot; magazine heralded the game as a program of &quot;outstanding achievement&quot;, considering that the game&#x27;s playing area was calculated at &quot;600 times more than the actual screen area&quot;.

&quot;Tranz Am&quot; reached number one on the ZX Spectrum charts compiled by WHSmith replacing Ultimate&#x27;s first game &quot;Jet Pac&quot;.

<doc id="901769" wikidata="Q1432462" url="?curid=901769" title="Raymond &amp; Maria">
<text>Raymond &amp; Maria was a Swedish pop group. It was started in 2002 by the male members of the band: Johan, Staffan, Olle and Per. As singers they found Maria and her sister Camilla. The first single from the band was &quot;Ingen vill veta var du köpt din tröja&quot; (later released in English as &quot;No One Notices Your Brand New T-shirt&quot;) in 2004. The song was number one in the Swedish charts for several weeks.

The band produced a stir when they broke through with their anti-commercial messages. The music is simple with only drums, guitar and vocals. As the band is quite concerned with their privacy, they have opted to not disclose the band members&#x27; last names. Nonetheless it has emerged that Johan Kindblom is the author of the lyrics.

The name comes from a swinging club in Stockholm.

The band broke up in 2013.

<doc id="901771" wikidata="Q1563513" url="?curid=901771" title="HELLP syndrome">
<text>HELLP syndrome is a complication of pregnancy; the acronym stands for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. It usually begins during the last three months of pregnancy or shortly after childbirth. Symptoms may include feeling tired, retaining fluid, headache, nausea, upper right abdominal pain, blurry vision, nosebleeds, and seizures. Complications may include disseminated intravascular coagulation, placental abruption, and kidney failure.
The cause is unknown. The condition occurs in association with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Other risk factors include previously having the syndrome and a mother older than 25 years. The underlying mechanism may involve abnormal placental development. Diagnosis is generally based on blood tests finding signs of red blood cell breakdown (lactate dehydrogenase greater than 600 U/L), an aspartate transaminase greater than 70 U/L, and platelets less than 100×109/l. If not all the criteria are present, the condition is incomplete.
Treatment generally involves delivery of the baby as soon as possible. This is particularly true if the pregnancy is beyond 34 weeks of gestation. Medications may be used to decrease blood pressure and blood transfusions may be required.
HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.7% of pregnancies and affects about 15% of women with eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia. Death of the mother is uncommon (&lt; 1%). Outcomes in the babies are generally related to how premature they are at birth. The syndrome was first named in 1982 by American gynaecologist Louis Weinstein.

==Signs and symptoms==
The first signs of HELLP usually start appearing midway through the third trimester, though the signs can appear in earlier and later stages. It is highly associated with known pre-eclampsia. Risk factors for pre-eclampsia include older age, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Symptoms for HELLP vary in severity and between individuals and are commonly mistaken with normal pregnancy symptoms, especially if they are not severe.

HELLP syndrome patients experience general discomfort followed by severe epigastric pain or right upper abdominal quadrant pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, backache, anaemia, and hypertension. Some patients may also have a headache and visual issues. These symptoms may also become more severe at night. As the condition progresses and worsens, a spontaneous hematoma occurs following the rupture of the liver capsule, which occurs more frequently in the right lobe. The presence of any combinations of these symptoms, subcapsular liver hematoma in particular, warrants an immediate check-up due to the high morbidity and mortality rates of this condition.

==Risk factors==
Elevated body mass index and metabolic disorders, as well as antiphospholipid syndrome, significantly increase the risk of HELLP syndrome in all female patients. Females who have had or are related to a female with previous HELLP syndrome complications tend to be at a higher risk in all their subsequent pregnancies.

The risk of HELLP syndrome is not conclusively associated with a specific genetic variation, but likely a combination of genetic variations, such as &quot;FAS&quot; gene, &quot;VEGF&quot; gene, glucocorticoid receptor gene and the tol-like receptor gene, increase the risk.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology is still unclear and an exact cause is yet to be found. However, it shares a common mechanism, which is endothelial cell injury, with other conditions, such as acute kidney injury and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Increasing the understanding of HELLP syndrome&#x27;s pathophysiology will enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially in the early stages. This will lead to advancements in the prevention, management, and treatment of the condition, which will increase the likelihood of both maternal and fetal survival and recovery.

===Inflammation and coagulation===
As a result of endothelial cell injury, a cascade of pathological reactions manifests and become increasingly severe and even fatal as signs and symptoms progress. Following endothelial injury, vasospasms and platelet activation occur alongside the decreased release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor and increased the release of von Willebrand factor (vWF), leading to general activation of the coagulation cascade and inflammation. Placental components, such as inflammatory cytokines and syncytiotrophoblast particles interact with the maternal immune system and endothelial cells, further promoting coagulation and inflammation. These interactions also elevate leukocyte numbers and interleukin concentrations, as well as increase complement activity.

===Low platelet count===
vWF degradation in HELLP syndrome is inhibited due to decreased levels of degrading proteins, leading to an increased exposure of platelets to vWF. As a result, thrombotic microangiopathies develop and lead to thrombocytopenia.

===Blood breakdown===
As a result of the high number of angiopathies, the erythrocytes fragment as they pass through the blood vessels with damaged endothelium and large fibrin networks, leading to macroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. As a consequence of hemolysis, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemoglobin are released, with the latter binding to serum bilirubin or haptoglobin.

===Liver===
During the coagulation cascade, fibrin is deposited in the liver and leads to hepatic sinusoidal obstruction and vascular congestion, which increase intrahepatic pressure. Placenta-derived FasL (CD95L), which is toxic to human hepatocytes, leads to hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis by inducing the expression of TNFα and results in the release of liver enzymes. Hepatic damages are worsened by the disrupted portal and total hepatic blood flow that result as a consequence of the microangiopathies. Collectively, widespread endothelial dysfunction and hepatocellular damage result in global hepatic dysfunction often leading to liver necrosis, haemorrhages, and capsular rupture.

==Diagnosis==
Early and accurate diagnosis, which relies on laboratory tests and imaging exams, is essential for treatment and management and significantly reduces the morbidity rate. However, diagnosis of the syndrome is challenging, especially due to the variability in the signs and symptoms and the lack of consensus amongst healthcare professionals. Similarities to other conditions, as well as normal pregnancy features, commonly lead to misdiagnosed cases or more often, delayed diagnosis.

There is a general consensus regarding the main three diagnostic criteria of HELLP syndrome, which include hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia in patients suspected to have preeclampsia. 
* A blood smear will often exhibit abnormalities, such as schistocytes, bur cells, and helmet cells, which indicate erythrocyte damage. 
* Thrombocytopenia, which is the earliest coagulopathy present in all HELLP syndrome patients, is indicated by low platelet count (below 100 x 109 L-1) or by testing the levels of fibrin metabolites and antithrombin III.
* Elevated serum levels of certain proteins, in particular, LDH, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), are indicative of hepatic dysfunction. Extremely high serum levels of these proteins, specifically LDH levels &gt; 1,400 IU/L, AST levels &gt; 150 IU/L and ALT levels &gt; 100 IU/L, significantly elevate the risk of maternal mortality.

A number of other, but less conclusive, clinical diagnostic criteria are also used in diagnosis alongside the main clinical diagnostic criteria for HELLP syndrome.
* &quot;De novo&quot; manifestation of hypertension with systolic pressure and diastolic pressure above 160mmHg and 110 mmHg, respectively.
* Proteinuria, leucocytosis and elevated uric acid concentrations &gt; 7.8 mg.
* Decreased serum haptoglobin and haemoglobin levels.
* Increased serum bilirubin levels and visual disturbances.

Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are instrumental in the correct diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in patients with suspected liver dysfunction. Unurgent cases must undergo MRI, but laboratory tests, such as glucose determination, are more encouraged in mild cases of HELLP syndrome.

===Classification===
A classification system, which was developed in Mississippi, measures the severity of the syndrome using the lowest observed platelet count in the patients alongside the appearance of the other two main clinical criteria. Class I is the most severe, with a relatively high risk of morbidity and mortality, compared to the other two classes.
* Class I HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count below 50,000/μL.
* Class II HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 50,000-100,000/μL.
* Class III HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 100,000-150,000/μL.

Another classification system, introduced in Memphis, categorises HELLP syndrome based on its expression.
* Partial expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of one or two of the main diagnostic criteria.
* The complete expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of all three main diagnostic criteria.

==Treatment==
The only current recommended and most effective treatment is delivery of the baby, as the signs and symptoms diminish and gradually disappear following the delivery of the placenta. Prompt delivery is the only viable option in cases with multiorgan dysfunction or multiorgan failure, haemorrhage and considerable danger to the fetus. Certain medications are also used to target and alleviate specific symptoms.

Corticosteroids are of unclear benefit, though there is tentative evidence that they can increase the mother&#x27;s platelet count.

==Prognosis==
With treatment, maternal mortality is about 1 percent, although complications such as placental abruption, acute kidney injury, subcapsular liver hematoma, permanent liver damage, and retinal detachment occur in about 25% of women. Perinatal mortality (stillbirths plus death in infancy) is between 73 and 119 per 1000 babies of woman with HELLP, while up to 40% are small for gestational age. In general, however, factors such as gestational age are more important than the severity of HELLP in determining the outcome in the baby.

==Epidemiology==
HELLP syndrome affects 10-20% of pre-eclampsia patients and is a complication in 0.5-0.9% of all pregnancies. Caucasian women over 25 years of age comprise most of the diagnosed HELLP syndrome cases. In 70% of cases before childbirth, the condition manifests in the third trimester, but 10% and 20% of the cases exhibit symptoms before and after the third trimester, respectively. Postpartum occurrences are also observed in 30% of all HELLP syndrome cases.

==History==
HELLP syndrome was identified as a distinct clinical entity (as opposed to severe pre-eclampsia) by Dr. Louis Weinstein in 1982. In a 2005 article, Weinstein wrote that the unexplained postpartum death of a woman who had haemolysis, abnormal liver function, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia motivated him to review the medical literature and to compile information on similar women. He noted that cases with features of HELLP had been reported as early as 1954.

<text>The Redbreast (, 2000) is a crime novel by Norwegian writer Jo Nesbø, the third in the Harry Hole series (although the first in the series to be available in English).

A large part of the book is laid at the time of the Second World War – specifically, the Siege of Leningrad, wartime Vienna and the Bombing of Hamburg – making &quot;The Redbreast&quot; a war novel as well as a crime novel. The book touches deeply on the still highly sensitive issue of Norwegian Collaboration with the Nazis and specifically the voluntary recruitment of Norwegians to the Waffen SS.

The novel was voted Best Norwegian Crime Novel ever. Upon translation into English, by Don Bartlett, the novel was shortlisted for the Crime Writers&#x27; Association Duncan Lawrie International Dagger.

==Synopsis==
During the Siege of Leningrad, a small group of Norwegian Waffen-SS volunteers are manning trenches just a short distance from the western lines. One of their number, Daniel Gudeson, is shot through the head and killed when he stands up to celebrate midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve. His body and face are covered up and he is laid to wait for a burial committee the following day. That same night, another soldier named Sindre Fauke disappears, believed to have defected to the Red Army. Oddly, later that night, Gudeson&#x27;s body mysteriously reappears in the trench. After a hand grenade lands the soldiers in hospital, one of them, under the guise of &quot;Uriah&quot;, falls in love with a nurse. After an unsuccessful attempt to elope, the two are separated.

Decades later, when the U.S. President visits Oslo for an Israeli-Palestinian peace conference, policeman Harry Hole is assigned to the security detail. After shooting a suspected assassin during the approach of the President&#x27;s convoy, Hole is promoted to inspector and investigates a crime involving a very expensive sniper rifle. In addition, a group of neo-Nazis with which Hole has a prior history is suspected in the murder of an elderly drunkard. Hole and his colleague, Ellen Gjelten, hear of a man connected to arms dealings called &#x27;The Prince&#x27; and set out to learn his identity. Hole shares a mutual attraction with a colleague named Rakel, who is reluctant to take things further due to a custody battle for her son, Oleg; unbeknownst to her and Hole, the matter is being orchestrated by Rakel&#x27;s superior, who is also infatuated with her.

Ellen accidentally discovers the identity of The Prince, but she is murdered by Sverre Olsen, one of the neo-Nazis, before she can identify him to Hole. When Hole and his new assistant, Halvorsen, attempt to arrest Olsen, they discover that another police inspector, Tom Waaler, has apparently shot him in self defence. When Rakel&#x27;s superior and an elderly woman named Signe Juul are both murdered by the sniper rifle, Hole finds a link between the killings and Norwegian collaborators during the Nazi occupation. He also realizes that the killer has a split personality, with the second personality being that of Daniel Gudeson. Hole is led to believe that Juul&#x27;s husband Even, who was obsessed with Gudeson, is behind the killings. However, Hole finds that Even has apparently committed suicide in an attempt to stop his &quot;other personality&quot; from continuing the murders.

Hole realizes he is wrong when he comes across the actual killer&#x27;s journal, in which he attacks the Norwegian royal family and other government officials who fled to England during the occupation and who later labeled the collaborators as &#x27;traitors&#x27; despite their resistance to the onslaught of the Soviet forces. The killer also reveals the details behind the mysterious reappearance of Gudeson&#x27;s body in the trenches and the truth behind Fauke&#x27;s supposed defection. Finally, the killer threatens to assassinate Norway&#x27;s Crown Prince during imminent Constitution Day celebrations as retribution for the &#x27;betrayal&#x27; of Norway&#x27;s leadership during the war. Hole rushes to prevent the assassination, managing to stop the attempt at almost the last second in a hotel room. To keep the assassination attempt out of the press and to prevent any problems for the assassin&#x27;s surviving family (which includes those close to Hole) Hole&#x27;s success is covered up.

<text>Sorgenfri (lit. &quot;free of sorrow&quot;, like Sans Souci) is a neighbourhood in Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality in Greater Copenhagen lying just north of Kongens Lyngby.

The neighbourhood is enclosed between the landmarks of a forest with Lyngby Åmose, Mølleådalen and Spurveskjulskoven (lit. &quot;sparrow shelter&quot; forest) in the south, the Furesø Lake in the west and the parklands of Sorgenfri Palace and the Open Air Museum in the east. In the north of Sorgenfri lies the town Virum – which was till the end of the First World War a village. 

Lottenborg is an inn located in Sorgenfri. The building originates from the 1700s, where the town&#x27;s gatekeeper (Danish: &quot;vangemanden&quot;) lived, which gave the house the nickname &#x27;the Gatekeeper&#x27;s House&#x27; (Danish: &quot;Vangehuset&quot;). The gatekeeper worked on the royal Sorgenfri Castle, and when Princess Charlotte was born in 1789 and the house was renamed to Lottenborg in her honour. Lottenberg eventually became a popular inn, and worked as inn and restaurant for many years. After the death of the owner in 1993, the house was willed to Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality. It was put on sale in 2010 and sold in 2011.

<doc id="901788" wikidata="Q1342578" url="?curid=901788" title="England national amateur football team">
<text>The England national amateur football team was the amateur representative team for England at football. It was formed in 1901, due to the growth of the professional game which meant that amateur players could no longer easily find places in the main England national team.

It was the most successful team in the British Amateur Championship, winning on 16 occasions (5 joint). The England amateur team was disbanded by The Football Association in 1974.

==First match and unbeaten run==

Its first international match was against Germany on 21 September 1901, a 12–0 win at White Hart Lane, London, with R. E. Foster scoring 6 (one source gives 7). It was to be another five years before an official England amateur team was founded. The next match was away against France on 1 November 1906 and resulted in a 15–0 win for England, with Stanley Harris netting seven goals and Vivian Woodward four. The team played many internationals against the full representative sides of Europe, which were usually a mixture of amateur and professional players. The strength of the English amateur team meant they were still able to beat many of these sides and in fact they were unbeaten in 20 matches from 1906 to 1910. Whilst these England amateur matches are not considered full senior internationals by The Football Association, they are deemed to be by their opponents. As such, the England amateur side delivered the biggest defeats on several European nations; the Netherlands in 1907, Germany and Belgium in 1909, and Sweden &amp; Hungary in 1912 (as Great Britain), beating them 12–2, 9–0, 11–2, 12–2 and 7–0 respectively.

==England amateurs and Great Britain Olympics team==

 There is a difference of opinion as to whether the England amateur team was effectively the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 1908 and 1912 Olympic football tournaments. The FA&#x27;s website considers the gold medals in these tournaments a win for the England amateur side rather than a British team, whilst in Bryon Butler&#x27;s book it is shown that the winners&#x27; certificate names England. Conversely, Mark Chapman&#x27;s &quot;England&#x27;s Amateurs&quot; site states that the 1908 and 1912 teams were Great Britain and points to the fact that photographic evidence shows the team playing with the Union flag on their shirts. It can be stated that both arguments are true, as it was the case for the 1956 Olympic tournament where the team played as &quot;Great Britain&quot; but the team was organised by the FA and consisted solely of amateur Englishmen as the other home nations withdrew their support.

==Demise and successors==
The England amateur team was disbanded in 1974 when the Football Association abolished the distinction between amateurs and professionals, simply calling them &quot;players&quot;. A semi-professional representative team, made up of players from the National League System, now plays in its place.

==Top goalscorers==

The list below only includes those matches prior to World War I (1906–1914).

Willie Jordan has scored 6 goals, while the likes of William Stapley, Arthur Bell, Syd Owen and Frederick Chapman settled at five.

<text>The Devil&#x27;s Star (, literally &quot;The Nightmare Cross&quot;, 2003) is a crime novel by Norwegian writer Jo Nesbø, the fifth in the Harry Hole series. An English-translated version of the book named &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Star&quot; was translated by Don Bartlett. 

The story moves between two parallel themes – the appearance of a new serial killer terrorizing Oslo, and Harry Hole&#x27;s ongoing feud with the corrupt and utterly ruthless fellow police officer Tom Waaler, which was already a major part of the plot of the two previous books, &quot;The Redbreast&quot; and &quot;Nemesis&quot;. Eventually, the two issues converge – enabling Harry to resolve both in the course of a single cataclysmic night.

==Plot introduction==
A young woman is murdered in her Oslo flat. One finger has been severed from her left hand, and behind her eyelid is secreted a tiny diamond in the shape of a five-pointed star – a pentagram, the devil&#x27;s star.

Detective Harry Hole is assigned to the case with his long-time adversary Tom Waaler and initially wants no part in it. But Hole is already on notice to quit the force and is left with little alternative but to drag himself out of his alcoholic stupor and get to work.

A wave of similar murders is on the horizon. An emerging pattern suggests that Oslo has a serial killer on its hands, and the five-pointed devil&#x27;s star seems to be the key to solving the riddle.

==Synopsis==
Pursuing his suspicions during the Nemesis investigation, Inspector Harry Hole attempts to convince the Chief Inspector that his colleague, Tom Waaler, is a criminal arms dealer known as &#x27;The Prince&#x27;. Due to a lack of evidence, Hole is refused and goes on an alcoholic binge. Hole&#x27;s superior reluctantly sends termination of employment papers to the Chief Inspector, but Hole gets a short reprieve as the Chief is on holiday for three weeks and thus cannot sign them.

Meanwhile, a murder victim is discovered dead in her shower, shot in the head. Waaler is appointed to lead the investigation, but Hole and his former partner Beate Lønn are attached to his team. Hole, investigating the murder scene, discovers a small, red, five-pointed diamond under the eyelid of the victim and that a finger is missing from her left hand. Another murder is presumed when the director of a theatre production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; reports that his wife has gone missing. Her finger is later sent to Kripos; it has a ring on it with a small, red five-pointed diamond. A few days later a third victim is found, this time in the female toilets at a law firm, also on the floor and a five-pointed red diamond on the body. Yet again a finger has been removed.

Waaler – who has heard about Hole&#x27;s suspicions – offers to include him in his illegal dealings, dangling the large financial benefits as an inducement. In return, Hole has to perform an initiation task. Hole is initially confused as to why Waaler is effectively admitting his guilt, but is reminded that, as an alcoholic, Hole&#x27;s evidence would not be sufficient to convict him if he went to his superiors. He agrees to think about the offer. Meanwhile, a chance sighting of a pentagram brings Hole a flash of inspiration. The five-pointed diamonds found on the victims are in a similar shape – known as a Devil&#x27;s Star – and provide a major clue as to the next possible murder locations, which are kept under surveillance: one is in a student residence hall and the other is a house on the outskirts of Oslo, owned by Olaug Sivertsen.

While investigating this house, Lønn discovers that the likely murderer is Olaug&#x27;s son, Sven. She informs Hole by phone as he and Waaler are checking out the other prospective crime scene. Hole gives this information to Waaler, who immediately leaves to assist Lønn. Hole, using recently installed CCTV cameras, notices another pentagram on a student&#x27;s door. Eventually, the body of the victim is found at the residence hall and is determined to actually be the first victim of the killer, murdered five days before the first discovered victim. Meanwhile, Waaler apprehends Sven, but his threats to shoot him ultimately lead Lønn to realise that he intended to murder Sven instead of arresting him, leading her to agree with Hole&#x27;s suspicions.

Hole is given his task by Waaler: to kill Sven in custody using a poison capsule, as Waaler&#x27;s influence is such that he can guarantee that Hole will get away with it. Waaler&#x27;s argument for the murder is that he would get a lenient punishment from the Norwegian judicial system, and that death would be a worthy sentence for his crimes. Hole realizes however that Waaler&#x27;s true aim to eliminate a potential witness to his role in the smuggling ring, and to this end Hole convinces Sven that he should trust him and not Waaler. Hole breaks Sven out of custody with the intention of bringing Waaler to justice. Now a hunted man, Hole&#x27;s future in the police and quite possibly his life depend on his being able to prove Waaler&#x27;s crimes.

Sven is willing to testify against Waaler, but is adamant of his innocence of the murders, and consequently his testimony is wholly dependent on Hole exonerating him. Hole is faced with the daunting task of discovering the true murderer in a single day. However, a clue is provided by a seemingly irrelevant photograph which Sven shows Hole, and this combined with a very minute but precise piece of forensic evidence points to a completely unexpected perpetrator. Leaving Sven chained up, Hole encounters his new suspect in the immediate aftermath of his committing yet another murder. Hole comes very near to being killed himself, but eventually the killer commits suicide. Just as Hole believes that he is in the clear, Waaler calls to inform him that he has kidnapped his surrogate son Oleg and demands that he trade Sven for the boy.

Hole arranges a meeting at the residence hall. Using the CCTV cameras as a bargaining chip, Hole tries to convince Waaler that his position is hopeless. More and more outrageous stories are proposed by Waaler to explain how he intends to cover up what has happened, and when it becomes clear that Waaler will kill all three witnesses in the lift of the building, Hole enacts an escape plan and manages to overpower Waaler and rescue Sven and Oleg, with Waaler ultimately being killed in the ensuing scuffle. Having exposed Waaler and solved the case, Hole&#x27;s termination of employment is rescinded and he returns to the force.

==Adaptation==
Netflix will adapt &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Star&quot; as a series, with Øystein Karlsen directing, and Nesbø writing the script. The series, entitled &quot;Jo Nesbø&#x27;s Detective Hole&quot; will star Tobias Santelmann as Harry Hole, Joel Kinnaman as Tom Waaler and Pia Tjelta as Rakel Fauke.

<doc id="901796" wikidata="Q1190864" url="?curid=901796" title="The Bourne Supremacy">
<text>The Bourne Supremacy is the second Jason Bourne novel written by Robert Ludlum, first published in 1986. It is the sequel to Ludlum&#x27;s bestseller &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (1980) and precedes Ludlum&#x27;s final Bourne novel, &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (1990).

&quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; gave its name to the second Bourne film, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, starring Matt Damon in 2004; however, the movie adaptation has a completely different plot from the novel.

== Plot ==

Jason Bourne has recovered from most of his mental and physical injuries and is teaching Asian studies at a university in Maine under his real name of David Webb, living happily on campus with his wife Marie under supervision of psychiatrist Morris Panov.

Meanwhile, high-ranking U.S. officials Ambassador Raymond Havilland and Undersecretary Edward McAllister discuss an increasingly alarming situation in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where the popular Communist official Sheng Chou Yang is boosting his rise to power with assassinations perpetrated by someone impersonating Jason Bourne. They fear that Sheng, a fanatical nationalist, might trigger a war, and therefore want him to be found and killed. Webb would be ideal for this, but they plan to involve him indirectly owing to his mistrust of the U.S. government and Webb&#x27;s deep-seated emotional instability due to the loss of his first wife and children in Vietnam.

McAllister arrives and informs Webb of the assassin in Asia who is killing under the name of Jason Bourne. Webb is told he requires a more visible security force because someone wants him dead.

Soon thereafter, Marie is abducted by unknown people. Webb returns to the house, finds clues to her abduction, and immediately phones government officials, threatening to leak information about Treadstone and Medusa in an attempt to get assistance. He finds out information has been manipulated in order to make him seem crazy and delusional, and that his only course of action is to follow the instructions left by the kidnappers. He turns to the only person he thinks will be able to help him, Alexander Conklin, even though Conklin once tried to kill him. Conklin, now limping, is convinced there is government involvement but that they have lost control of the situation and the hired guns holding Marie are no longer in their control. Webb, who has transformed back into the persona of Jason Bourne, now has no choice but to go to Hong Kong and play out the scenario to get Marie back. In Hong Kong Bourne is led to a wealthy Tai-Pan who wants Webb to locate the impostor Jason Bourne because the impostor killed his wife; the Taipan is actually a British intelligence officer named Lin Wenzu collaborating with the CIA to make Bourne find the impostor. Bourne agrees, saying that if his wife is not heard from the very moment he returns, he will kill his nabbed impostor without a second thought. Lin Wenzu is later critically injured when he uncovers and kills traitors on his team passing information to Sheng.

Marie, held captive in a British hospital, fakes illness and escapes, taking refuge with Catherine Staples, a former colleague now employed at the Canadian consulate in Hong Kong. The duo make runs and go incognito to avoid the CIA and to find Webb. Unfortunately Marie runs away from Staples thinking she has joined forces with her captors who want to take her back, and Staples gets killed by Sheng&#x27;s men. Marie later contacts Conklin and Panov, who arrive in Hong Kong and confront McAllister and Havilland.

Webb, tracking the impostor Bourne on land, water and air, through Kowloon and Macau, encounters D&#x27;Anjou, alias Echo, another former Medusa operative, who is also tracking down the impostor Bourne, whom he had personally trained to be like Bourne. They join forces and track the impostor to mainland China, where they realise that a trap was laid by Sheng who was anticipating them following the impostor, and Echo is captured. Webb tracks him to a bird sanctuary at night, where Sheng Chou Yang is seen holding an open air conference with his rebel supporters and captured &quot;traitors&quot; to his cause, whom he is going to &quot;judge&quot;, including Echo and the impostor Bourne. Echo is executed but not before he manages to delay Sheng and buy enough time for Bourne to mount a surprise attack on everyone. Amidst explosions and gunfire and killings, Webb captures the impostor Bourne, hijacks an empty charter plane and brings him to Kowloon, but in attempting to swap the impostor for Marie, is misled by McAllister, as Marie is not with them as was agreed, and still hidden by Conklin. Thinking Marie has been killed, an angry Webb now attacks and bombs Havilland&#x27;s estate on Victoria Peak, where the impostor Bourne is killed and Webb nearly is as well, saved only by the timely arrival of Marie, Panov, and Conklin.

Webb and Marie learn he was selected because no one was more skilled and lethal, and Marie was abducted because Webb would have never agreed to the mission had the CIA told him the truth. Since Webb has now seen what Sheng is capable of and since Echo died for his sake, he decides to go back into the fray and kill Sheng. McAllister accompanies Webb, and during their search for Sheng, McAllister explains that he should be the one to kill Sheng, and Sheng will only trust McAllister for agreeing to rendezvous, and this has been McAllister&#x27;s plan from the start. They fool Sheng into meeting with them, proposing to destroy the only copy of confidential documents that can expose him in return for money. The meeting between Sheng, Webb and McAllister takes place on the Chinese border with the assistance of Wong, a previous acquaintance of Bourne. During the meeting, McAllister sees that Sheng has already grabbed the confidential documents from Victoria Peak, and is shot by Sheng before he can shoot the latter. But Bourne arrives and stabs Sheng dead. Webb, McAllister, and Wong escape in Sheng&#x27;s helicopter amidst gunfire.

In the end, it is shown that Lin Wenzu and McAllister have survived, Havilland commends McAllister for his acts of bravado, saying he will be promoted, Panov and Conklin have left for the U.S., and Webb and Marie have flown to Hawaii to rest.

<doc id="901799" wikidata="Q456803" url="?curid=901799" title="Sidney Fox">
<text>Sidney Fox (born Sarah Liefer; December 10, 1907 – November 15, 1942) was an American stage and film actress in the late 1920s and 1930s. Fox&#x27;s Hollywood film debut was in Universal Pictures&#x27; 1931 production &quot;Bad Sister&quot;, which is notable for also being the first film of actress Bette Davis.

==Early life==
Sarah Liefer was born in 1907 in &quot;Poland-Galicia&quot;. In 1911, she emigrated with her Jewish parents — Rucha Rose (née Szapiro) and Jacob Liefer—to New York, where, by 1920, her mother had remarried. Rose&#x27;s second husband was Joseph Fox, who identified himself in government records as a Yiddish-speaking native of Poland. After her mother&#x27;s marriage to Fox, Sidney adopted her step-father&#x27;s surname, although the federal census of 1930 shows her younger brother Samuel continued to use his given last name, Liefer, in the Fox household. The census documents that in April that year, 22-year-old Sidney was living with her mother and stepfather on the 500 block of West 178th Street in Manhattan, along with Samuel and their two stepbrothers. Sidney identified herself then professionally as a stenographer, while during any spare time, she was busy pursuing roles in stage productions. Additional sources regarding Fox&#x27;s early life indicate she was employed in an array of other jobs as well, including work as a seamstress, a secretary in a law firm, and as a model or &quot;mannequin&quot; in a shop on Fifth Avenue.

==Stage and film career==
By the late 1920s, Fox had begun studying acting to establish a stage or film career. She temporarily joined a touring theatrical company around 1928, and within a year, she was performing on Broadway. She had a role in &quot;It Never Rains&quot; in 1929, and the next year, she portrayed the character Rhoda Wampas in the comedy &quot;Lost Sheep&quot;. In May 1930, the theatre critic for &quot;Variety&quot; gave &quot;Lost Sheep&quot; a lukewarm review but complimented Fox&#x27;s energetic performance in the play, noting &quot;That little cutie Sidney Fox, who first came out in &quot;It Never Rains,&quot; pleased again with her Rhoda.&quot; Someone else in the audience was impressed with Fox, Carl Laemmle Jr., then head of production at Universal Studios. Laemmle soon signed her to a multi-year contract with the Hollywood film company.

Fox made her film debut in the 1931 Hobart Henley drama &quot;Bad Sister&quot;, playing opposite Conrad Nagel, Humphrey Bogart, Zasu Pitts, and Bette Davis, who was making her movie debut as well. In 1931, Sidney was selected by motion picture advertisers as a WAMPAS Baby Star, recognizing her as one of the film industry&#x27;s most promising new actresses. The next year, she starred as Madamoiselle Camille L&#x27;Espanaye in the Robert Florey film &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; opposite Bela Lugosi. Then, in 1933, she played opposite operatic bass Feodor Chaliapin in the English-language version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Many of her subsequent roles were bit parts in B-movies, although she did have a starring role in the 1935 release &quot;School for Girls&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Fox&#x27;s relationship with studio executive Carl Laemmle Jr. as his mistress was one of Hollywood&#x27;s open secrets for several years. In December 1932, however, she wed Charles Beahan (1903–1968), and they remained married until her death. By 1940, according to that year&#x27;s federal census, Charles and Sidney Beahan were residing together in a $125-a-month rented home at 9421 Charleville Drive in Beverly Hills, California. Fox is listed in that census as having no occupation and &quot;not seeking employment&quot; in 1940, and Beahan is documented as being employed as a &quot;Literary Agent/Stage &amp; Motion Pic[ture]s&quot;.

Two years later, on November 15, 1942, Fox died in Hollywood from an overdose of sleeping pills that authorities ruled &quot;an accident&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; announced her passing before this ruling in its issue of November 18. In the paper&#x27;s brief obituary, Fox&#x27;s given age, and the date of her death differ from those documented in official government records and on her gravestone in New York:

When Sidney died, Charles was reported to live at 519 North Crescent Drive in Beverly Hills. Following the coroner&#x27;s investigation of her death, her body was returned to New York City and interred at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Glendale, Queens.

==Filmography==
Sidney Fox&#x27;s final work of her film career consisted of last-minute retakes she performed in early August 1934 to complete the production of the musical comedy &quot;Down to Their Last Yacht&quot; before its release on August 31, 1934. Another film in which she starred, &quot;School for Girls&quot;, was completed before &quot;Down to Their Last Yacht&quot;, but this dramatic film was not released in the United States until February 19, 1935. Therefore, &quot;Down to Their Last Yacht&quot; includes Fox&#x27;s final performance on film, but &quot;School for Girls&quot; is her final film to be released.

<doc id="901806" wikidata="Q7659936" url="?curid=901806" title="Sydney Fox">
<text>Sydney Fox is the title character on the television show &quot;Relic Hunter&quot;, played by Tia Carrere.

==Relic Hunter==
In the TV series &quot;Relic Hunter&quot;, Sydney Fox is a Professor of Ancient Studies, at a generic North American university. She most often teaches courses on what appear to be archaeology and cultural anthropology, though she is also shown teaching history and architecture as required by the plot. She frequently misses her own classes to work as a &quot;relic hunter&quot; who is constantly on the hunt for ancient treasures and artefacts so that she can bring them to their university’s museum. Inspired by an Indiana Jones style of adventure, Fox is often found battling rival hunters for artefacts. Her supervisors only rarely complain, since Fox usually stores the relics she finds in the university museum for safekeeping. Fox herself regards it as her duty to keep relics from falling into the wrong hands, either because they should be enjoyed by all mankind or because they are too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands.

Sydney&#x27;s weapon of choice is a Persian hand-crossbow, which she usually uses to deal with traps, relying on hand-to-hand combat when actually fighting.

The series has attached a number of stereotypes onto her role as an Archaeologist throughout the series. Producers of Relic Hunter have utilized sex appeal to enhance Sydney Fox&#x27;s character. Fox enjoys the rush of a dangerous mission, as she is unafraid of anything and is a good example of a strong and brave woman. Throughout the television series Fox&#x27;s clothing is often tight fitting and revealing which makes her easily identified as a feminine sex symbol. With the exotic styles and accessories, Fox portrays a picture of a glamorized archaeologist. This image may be misleading to the reality of the field, yet proves to be more appealing for viewers. In a few episodes, Sydney is actually shown conducting conventional excavations, though she abandons the digs in question once it becomes apparent that the answers she needs are in a nearby sacred cave or ruined temple.

Fox has an on-screen connection with Nigel Bailey. This connection is apparent through the emotional and physical bond they share as they work closely together. The storyline romanticizes and draws on an exotic setting in some episodes.

Episode 1 (&quot;Buddha&#x27;s Bowl&quot;) shows us Sydney Fox in her primary setting as a college professor. In the classroom, Fox expresses her teachings and love for her studies through a series of inappropriate class lessons. An example of this is in the first episode where her seductive dance moves and sexual tendencies are used to educate the students on tribal rituals Fox&#x27;s initial first impression on Nigel had certainly caught his attention. As she stripped out of her ritual clothing and back into her office attire, the newly introduced teaching assistant is shown admiring her body as he attempts to remain in conversation, despite his obvious sense of hesitation and mesmerisation.

==Popular culture and archaeology==
Archaeology as a field of study has often been incorrectly portrayed by popular culture and mass media. False stereotypes glamorise it with the use of violence and thrill. &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; is an example of how a profession can be altered to fit public interests. Although &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; has faults in its portrayal of the profession, the overall concept of searching for relics and uncovering historical archives is relevant. While Fox is portrayed as a young professional to the field, her sex appeal is used to intrigue viewers and place a different spin on a female archaeologist/professor. Like real archaeologists, Fox does not hunt relics for glory or monetary gain, but so that they can be studied and learned from.

==Setting==
The show takes place in a variety of different settings across the globe; therefore its archaeological appeal can be interesting for a wide range of viewers. As the episodes follow Fox on different &quot;hunts&quot;, the theme of the adventurous archaeologist searching for treasures is rampant throughout the series. The three seasons of &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; were created to have a multitude of different settings. Themes such as violence and the notion of discovery are intertwined with a sense of romance between characters Fox and Bailey. The idea of danger constantly being within hands reach makes the series both exciting and enticing to watch. This is a popular trend in contemporary archaeology programs.

Yasmin Jiwani argues that Fox &quot;represents the quintessential assimilated Asian American woman.&quot;

<doc id="901827" wikidata="Q6818962" url="?curid=901827" title="Meredith Music Festival">
<text>Meredith Music Festival (otherwise known simply as Meredith or MMF) is a three-day outdoor music festival held every December at the Meredith Supernatural Amphitheatre, a natural amphitheatre located on private farmland near the town of Meredith in Victoria, Australia.

A self-funded, non-commercial event that was first held in 1991, the festival spawned Golden Plains, a music festival that takes place over the Labour Day long weekend in March. At the APRA Music Awards of 2020, the festival won Licensee of the Year Award. The 2022 festival was the first to occur in 3 years, following no festivals since 2019.

==Description==
The festival is held on a private property owned by the family of one of the organisers, Chris Nolan, near the town of Meredith. Since the Nolans own the site, permanent infrastructure has been built including showers, compost toilets, and recycled water with the surrounding areas set up for usage of tents, vans, caravans or motorhomes. The culture and music of the festival reflects the strength, and diversity of the Melbourne and surrounding music scene. Warren Ellis (musician) (Dirty Three / Grinderman) referred to it as &quot;the world&#x27;s best festival&quot; in a 2010 interview.

===Attractions===
* The Meredith Gift (a reference to the Stawell Gift) is a nude running race, with the chance to win &quot;The Golden Jocks&quot; trophy.
* The Pink Flamingo Bar, an ever-popular cocktail bar
*Eric&#x27;s Terrace, cocktail bar with a large selection of food and drinks. 
* A sportsfield which includes the Meredith Eye Ferris wheel.
* The Ecoplex Cinema displays both short and feature-length films, including outdated informational films, advertisements and television shows intended to humour the audience.

===Ticketing===

The event is usually &quot;sold out&quot; before the date. Ticketing is implemented via a system which sees the first allocation distributed through a &#x27;Subscriber Ticket Ballot&#x27; - allowing half of the total allocation of tickets randomly distributed to &#x27;subscribers&#x27; already on MMF&#x27;s email list. Subscribers are notified in August and need to purchase their tickets within a set period of time.

The second allocation is sold in record stores in Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and the Surf Coast as has been the case in previous years. These go on sale after the Ballot closes. The third allocation is distributed online.

<doc id="901830" wikidata="Q7243725" url="?curid=901830" title="Prince's Bay, Staten Island">
<text>Prince&#x27;s Bay is a neighborhood located on the South Shore of New York City&#x27;s borough of Staten Island. Prince&#x27;s Bay is bordered to the north by Huguenot, to the south by the Raritan Bay, and to the west by Pleasant Plains. The neighborhood is represented in the New York State Senate by Andrew Lanza, in the New York State Assembly by Michael Reilly, and in the New York City Council by Joe Borelli.

The neighborhood&#x27;s name is often mispronounced as &quot;Princess Bay&quot; or &quot;Prince Bay.&quot; It is believed the town was originally called Princess Bay for reasons unknown. A 1776 map of Staten Island shows it as Princess Bay. The community&#x27;s United States Post Office officially bears the name &quot;Princes Bay Station&quot; according to the USPS web site and directory.

Prince&#x27;s Bay&#x27;s ZIP Code is 10309, which it shares with other South Shore neighborhoods including Charleston, Pleasant Plains and Richmond Valley. The western part of Prince&#x27;s Bay is now commonly recognized as a separate neighborhood, known as Rossville.

==History==
Development in the area accelerated when the southern terminus of the Staten Island Railway was moved from Eltingville to Tottenville in 1860. The Prince&#x27;s Bay station crosses underneath Seguine Avenue, formerly known as Prince&#x27;s Bay Road.

Primarily a fishing village at first, its oysters were so famous that &quot;Prince&#x27;s Bay Oysters&quot; could often be found on menus at prominent seafood restaurants in Manhattan, and even London. A large factory, operated by the S.S. White Dental Manufacturing Company, was once located along the shoreline at the foot of Seguine Avenue; at one point, the plant was the largest employer in all of Staten Island, but closed in 1972. In the late 1970s a small shopping center, known as the Prince&#x27;s Bay Trade Mart, was opened in the former factory complex; but its remote location and inability to compete with the larger and already-established Staten Island Mall doomed the project to failure, and it closed a few years later. The vacant complex was burned and razed, and the site has been kept empty due to ground contamination.

At the northeast corner of the neighborhood is Wolfe&#x27;s Pond Park, a city park that was the scene of a gruesome homicide committed by Gus Farace (at the time a Prince&#x27;s Bay resident) and three accomplices in 1979. Lemon Creek flows into the pond for which the park is named; the creek can then be traced westward into land where dairy and poultry farms flourished until the 1960s, eventually travelling by underground conduits to the Arthur Kill.

Prince&#x27;s Bay and other communities on Staten Island&#x27;s South Shore were once popular locations for summer homes, most of which were owned by residents of other boroughs, particularly Manhattan; however, these declined when the surrounding waters became increasingly polluted during the middle third of the 20th Century. The neighborhood also featured several small hotels, the Christmas Tree Inn on Wilbur Street being perhaps the most prominent among them. One block west of the latter is the South Campus of Staten Island University Hospital, formerly known as Richmond Memorial Hospital, which has the distinction of being the southernmost acute-care facility in both New York City and New York State.

In recent decades, the area&#x27;s waterfront has been revitalized by the development of many upscale single-family homes, becoming one of the more affluent areas on Staten Island.

==Points of interest==
The Abraham Manee House is one of the oldest houses in the five boroughs of New York City. The beams in the oldest part of the house date to 1670, while that part of the building is dated to 1690. Although designated a New York City Landmark by the NYC Preservation Committee (currently marked as endangered by the LPC), it seems that the local landlord, Leo Tallo, wishes to demolish it to build more townhouses. The house is located at 509 Seguine Avenue.

The Seguine Mansion is a historic house with an equestrian center with peacocks and horses. Some parts of the home date back to 1670 and have been deemed endangered by the New York City&#x27;s Preservation Committee.

Wolfe&#x27;s Pond Park and Lemon Creek Park are located in Prince&#x27;s Bay. These parks contain children&#x27;s playgrounds, open fields for outdoor sports such as football, baseball and soccer. These parks also contain running trails and divided dog parks for big and little dogs.

The House at 5910 Amboy Road was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

==Education==

===Public libraries===
New York Public Library operates the Huguenot Park Branch, which serves Prince&#x27;s Bay and other neighborhoods, at 830 Huguenot Avenue at Drumgoole Road East. The branch opened in January 1985.

===Educational facilities===
Prince&#x27;s Bay is home to Margaret Gioiosa Elementary School (P.S. 3) and Elias Bernstein Intermediate School (I.S. 7). St. Joseph-St. Thomas is a private Catholic school that serves grades Pre-K3-8.

==Transportation==
Prince&#x27;s Bay is served by the Staten Island Railway station of the same name.

It is served by the local buses on Seguine Avenue, and the local buses on Hylan Boulevard. It is also served by express buses to/from Manhattan: the SIM25 along Hylan and on Foster Road/Seguine Avenue, the SIM2 along Hylan as well as Huguenot Avenue, and the SIM24 along Huguenot Avenue.

In 2018 Commuter Fast Ferry service to/from Midtown and Downtown Manhattan was under study for Prince&#x27;s Bay.

<text>Václav Hanka (also written as &quot;Wenceslaus Hanka&quot;) (10 June 1791 – 12 January 1861) was a Czech philologist.

==Biography==
Hanka was born at Hořiněves near Hradec Králové. He was sent in 1807 to school at Hradec Králové, to escape the conscription, then to the University of Prague, where he founded a society for the cultivation of the Czech language. At Vienna, where he afterwards studied law, he established a Czech periodical; and in 1813 he made the acquaintance of Josef Dobrovský, an eminent philologist.

On 16 September 1817 Hanka claimed that he had discovered some manuscripts of 13th- and 14th-century Bohemian poems in the church tower of the town of Dvůr Králové nad Labem and later some more at Zelená Hora Castle near Nepomuk. The &quot;Manuscripts of Dvůr Králové and Zelená Hora&quot; were made public in 1818, with a German translation by Swoboda. The originals were presented by him to newly founded National Museum at Prague, of which he was appointed librarian in the same year. Great doubt, however, was felt as to their genuineness, and Dobrovský, by pronouncing the latter manuscript (also known as &quot;The Judgment of Libuše&quot;), to be an obvious fraud, confirmed the suspicion. Some years afterwards Dobrovský saw fit to modify his decision, but modern Czech scholars regard the manuscript as a forgery. A translation into English, &quot;The Manuscript of the Queen&#x27;s Court&quot;, was made by Albert Henry Wratislaw in 1852.

In 1846 Hanka edited the &quot;Reims Gospel&quot; and made it available to the general public, for which he received the cross of the Order of St. Anna by the Tsar Nicholas I and a brilliant ring by Emperor Ferdinand I.

In 1848 Hanka, who was an ardent pan-Slavist, took part at the Prague Slavic Congress, 1848 and other peaceful national demonstrations, being the founder of the political society &quot;&quot; (&quot;Slavonic Linden&quot;). He was elected to the Imperial Diet at Vienna, but declined to take his seat. In the winter of 1848 he became lecturer and in 1849 professor of Slavonic languages in the University of Prague.

He died in Prague on 12 January 1861 at the age of 70.

==Works==
His chief works and editions are the following:
*&quot;Hankowy Pjsne&quot; (Prague, 1815), a volume of poems
*&quot;Starobyla Skiadani&quot; (1817–1826), in 5 vols, a collection of old Bohemian poems, chiefly from unpublished manuscripts
*&quot;A Short History of the Slavonic Peoples&quot; (1818)
*&quot;A Bohemian Grammar&quot; (1822)
*&quot;A Polish Grammar&quot; (1839) (these two grammars were composed on a plan suggested by Dobrovský)
*&quot;Igor&quot; (1821), an ancient Russian epic, with a translation into Bohemian
*a part of the Gospels from the Reims manuscript in the Glagolitic alphabet (1846)
*the old Bohemian &quot;Chronicles of Delimit&quot; (1848)
*&quot;History of Charles IV&quot;, by Procop Luph (1848)
*&quot;Evangelium Ostromis&quot; (1853)
*Hanka also composed the song Moravo, Moravo!, sometimes used as a Moravian national anthem.

<doc id="901837" wikidata="Q660117" url="?curid=901837" title="Gaumee Salaam">
<text>&quot;&quot; (, ; ) is the national anthem of the Maldives. The lyrics were written by Muhammad Jameel Didi in 1948, and the melody was composed by Sri Lankan maestro Pandit Amaradeva in 1972.

&quot;Gaumee salaam&quot; is a declaration of national unity, the Islamic faith, the victory of historic battles, and an homage to the heroes who fell defending the nation. It also wishes further development on the country, while paying respect to the country&#x27;s leaders.

==History==
Until 1948, a melody without lyrics called the was performed by a royal band on state occasions at the , the residence of the Sultan. Soon after, it was decided that the needed lyrics accompanied by a new melody. The lyrics were written by a young poet and later chief justice, Mohamed Jameel Didi.

Jameel Didi wrote the words for the new Salaamathi bearing in mind the influence of Urdu poetry during the time, closely imitating its style and also furnishing his work with words borrowed from Arabic. Afterwards, Jameel Didi began looking for a tune to accompany his poem when he heard the noon chime (&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;) of his uncle&#x27;s clock. The tune was adopted to the lyrics, and the new was complete.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Maldivians became more aware of the importance of a national anthem, and in 1972, shortly before the Maldives was visited by Queen Elizabeth II, the government hastily commissioned Sri Lankan maestro W. D. Amaradeva for a new melody for the anthem. The original lyrics were retained, with a few changes to emphasise the fact that Maldives had been a republic since 1968. , this version of the anthem has survived without any modifications.

==Lyrics==
Normally, only the chorus and first two verses are sung.

<text>Amy Yuen Yee Chow (; born May 15, 1978) is an American former artistic gymnast who competed at the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics. She is best known for being a member of the Magnificent Seven, which won the United States&#x27; first team gold medal in Olympic gymnastics. She is also the first Asian-American woman to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics.

==Early life==
Chow was born to Nelson and Susan Chow, who had immigrated to the United States from Guangzhou and Hong Kong, respectively.

Chow began gymnastics training in 1981 at the age of 3. Her mother wanted her to be a ballerina and tried enrolling her in ballet schools, none of which would take a child that young. She then signed Amy up for classes at West Valley Gymnastics School in Campbell, California, where she joined an accelerated program at the age of 5, training under Mark Young and Diane Amos. Her younger brother, Kevin, was also a gymnast.

== Gymnastics career ==
=== 1989–1993 ===
At 11 years old, Chow became the first gymnast at her school to reach the elite level. She began competing nationally in 1990.

=== 1994–1995 ===
Chow&#x27;s first international competition was the 1994 World Championships in Dortmund, Germany. After a poor showing in preliminaries (she fell twice on vault and three times in a single balance beam routine), she performed well in the team finals, helping the United States clinch a silver medal.

The following year, Chow was part of the gold medal-winning American team at the 1995 Pan American Games, where she also won a gold medal on vault, silver on the uneven bars and bronze in the all-around. She made the United States team for the 1995 World Championships, but had to withdraw because of a sprained ankle sustained just days before the competition.

=== 1996 ===
Chow is primarily known for her performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics, where she won a gold medal with the team and a silver on the uneven bars. At the Olympic Trials, she fell off the beam, scraping her face on the side of the apparatus, but got up and completed her routine despite obvious pain, and was named to the Olympic team along with Amanda Borden, Dominique Dawes, Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Jaycie Phelps and Kerri Strug. The team would become known as the Magnificent Seven.

In the team final at the Olympics, Chow competed on the uneven bars and vault. In the bars event final, she completed a very difficult routine with an almost flawless dismount and scored a 9.837. She edged out the more experienced Dawes to tie for silver with Bi Wenjing of China, although the commentators felt Chow should not have had to share the medal, as Bi made a visible mistake that the judges did not take into account.

After the Olympics, Chow and her teammates performed in numerous exhibitions, including the John Hancock Tour.

=== 2000 ===
When Chow decided to return to gymnastics in hopes of competing at the 2000 Olympics, she contacted Mark Young and asked him to train her for it. He agreed, despite the fact that he was retired by then. Chow juggled a rigorous training regimen with medical research at Stanford University, where she was working toward her undergraduate degree in biology, but ultimately took time off school to train.

Five of the seven members of the Magnificent Seven tried for a spot on the 2000 Olympic team: Chow, Dawes, Miller, Moceanu and Phelps. In the end, only Chow and Dawes made it, along with Jamie Dantzscher, Kristen Maloney, Elise Ray and Tasha Schwikert. Chow proved she was in top form by finishing second in the all-around at the Olympic Trials. She was also named by Béla Károlyi as one of three leaders of the 2000 team, the other two being Ray and Maloney. The team finished fourth at the Olympics, and individually, Chow finished fourteenth in the all-around final.

Ten years later, on April 28, 2010, Chow and her teammates were awarded the bronze medal when it was discovered that the original bronze medalists, the Chinese team, had falsified the age of team member Dong Fangxiao. Dong&#x27;s results were nullified, and the Chinese team was stripped of the medal by the International Olympic Committee. Chow said that while the American team had been disappointed with its fourth-place finish in 2000, she nevertheless felt bad for the Chinese gymnasts because they had worked equally hard to medal.

=== Notable skills ===
Chow has two gymnastics skills named after her on the uneven bars: the &quot;Chow/Khorkina&quot; (stalder 1½ pirouette) and the &quot;Chow II&quot; (stalder to Shaposhnikova). She was nicknamed &quot;the Trickster&quot; within the gymnastics community for her extreme difficulty on each apparatus and her ability to perform complicated skills with apparent ease. She was the first American woman to perform a double-twisting Yurchenko vault and a tucked double-double bars dismount in international competition. She also competed one of the most difficult balance beam routines ever performed. It included a standing piked full; back handspring, layout, back handspring, layout series; full-twisting swing down; and round-off, back handspring, triple full dismount.

== Other accomplishments ==
In 1994, Chow received an advanced level certificate of merit for piano. In high school, she was a competitive diver for Castilleja School, and continued with the sport at Stanford. She also competed in pole vaulting as an unattached athlete at &quot;open&quot; track and field events. Because she received monetary compensation following the 1996 Olympics, she was ineligible to be a collegiate athlete.

== Post-Olympics ==
Chow attended Stanford University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in biology in 2002. She graduated from Stanford Medical School in 2007 and completed her residency in pediatrics at Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital. She is licensed as a physician and surgeon.

She married Jason Ho, an orthopedic surgeon, on July 10, 2010, in Saratoga, California. After finishing her residency at Lucile Packard in June 2010, she set up private practice as a general pediatrician in Northern California, where she lives with her husband and two sons, Timmy and Matty.

== Awards and recognition ==
Chow was inducted into the U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame twice: in 1998 as a member of the 1996 Olympic team, and again in 2005 as an individual. In 2004, she was inducted into the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame.

In spring 2003, Chow received the Paul &amp; Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. She was also a recipient of the Outstanding Overseas Chinese Award.

In 2008, she was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in the team category, alongside the rest of the Magnificent Seven. The team received their award in Chicago with other Olympic greats.

<text>Ernest Frank Guelph Cox (1883–1959) was a British engineer, with knowledge in electrical and mechanical engineering, which he notably deployed in marine salvage. Between 1924 and 1931 his Cox &amp; Danks Shipbreaking Co. successfully raised 35 ships of the German Imperial Navy High Seas Fleet that had been scuttled at Gutter Sound, Scapa Flow, in 1919. A tough but caring employer, after a series of fatalities and accidents to his employees, Cox sold his marine salvaging business to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company in 1932. He remained a consultant to the British Admiralty throughout his remaining career, and retired in the early 1950s after selling his profitable scrap metal business to Metal Industries Group.

==Early life==

Born in 1883, the eleventh son of a Wolverhampton draper, Cox left school at thirteen but chose to study electrical engineering in his spare time, and through a succession of jobs, earned himself the post of Engineer at a Wolverhampton power station by the age of eighteen. Deciding that anyone who could put electricity into people&#x27;s homes would become rich, Cox was determined to be just that, and moved to the post of Assistant Engineer at Leamington, and from there to Ryde Corporation on the Isle of Wight. In doing so he learned the art of salesmanship, selling electrical power installation to the inhabitants of Ryde.

==Early career==
From Ryde he moved to Hamilton, Scotland at the age of twenty-three, a change of position that taught him the rudiments of management. Moving yet again, this time to Wishaw in Lanarkshire, he took what was to be his last salaried job, laying down plant and network as Chief Engineer, aged just twenty-four. It was here in 1907 that Cox married the daughter of Wishaw Councillor Miller, the owner of Overton Forge, a Lanarkshire steelworks, and joined the firm as a partner. Unable to leave his post at the power station, he carried out both jobs simultaneously.

==Cox and Danks==
In 1913 he set up the firm of Cox and Danks Ltd, with his wife&#x27;s cousin Tommy Danks as a silent partner and financier. Cox&#x27;s need for capital was met by Danks, who sought a way to increase his inheritance without personal involvement in business.

The firm was well positioned to profit from large munitions manufacturing contracts during World War I. The end of hostilities opened new and lucrative opportunities in scrap and metal salvage, enabling Cox to open new business in Sheffield, and buy out his partner Danks&#x27; interests by 1920. In 1921 Cox had branched out into shipbreaking and opened a yard at Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, on the River Thames estuary. There the company broke up and sold off an assortment of World War I surplus vessels, including two British battleships and and some ex-German naval items including a large floating dock taken as reparation following the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet prior to the Armistice.

Fatal accidents on the wreck of the White Star liner (stranded on the Cow and Calf rocks, adjacent to Roches Point, off Cobh, Ireland in 1929), took some of the drive out of Cox, for he respected his workers and treated them accordingly. In Cox&#x27;s opinion money could always be replaced, but good men could not. Resultantly, during 1932 he sold the company&#x27;s marine salvaging business to Alloa Shipbreaking, and retired himself from marine salvage. Cox remained a consultant to the British Admiralty on matters of deep water salvage, and undertook their side of the work in the raising in 1932 of the old battleship , contracted to the Alloa Shipbreaking, which the Admiralty had used as a target ship and sunk by mistake.

Foreseeing the possibilities of another war in Europe in the late 1930s, Cox expanded the scrap metals business by opening yards in: Bedford; Birmingham; London (Brentford, Feltham and Park Royal); Manchester; and Neath (South Wales). During World War II he undertook research and development for classified materials for the Ministry of Supply. Cox&#x27;s last salvage task was during WW2, raising of the ship &quot;Stella&quot;, which, having been bombed by the Luftwaffe, had then sunk in and thereby blocked the Manchester Ship Canal. Again, Cox and Danks flourished as the war ended, disposing of military surplus and salvage.

In 1949, Cox sold the firm to Metal Industries Group, who by now owned Alloa Shipbreaking. Though the salvage side of the business never quite broke even, especially during the course of the salvage of the German fleet (he was ten thousand pounds out of pocket at the sale of his interests), the scrap metal side business offset the loss by turning considerable profit, ensuring that when he retired he and his family no longer needed to work.

Cox &amp; Danks Ltd did well during the post-Beeching Axe era in the early 1960s, tendering for contracts to scrap surplus railway locomotives, rolling stock and associated equipment for British Railways. The majority of the GWR King Class locomotives were withdrawn late in 1962, with ten allocated to Cox and Danks for disposal. On 1 April 1970 the company, by then part of the Metal Industries wing of Thorn Electrical Industries, became a subsidiary of the Six Hundred Metal Holdings group owned by George Cohen&#x27;s &quot;600&quot; Group.

==German High Seas Fleet==
Lacking work, by 1924 he turned his attention to the wreckage of the High Seas Fleet, scuttled at its moorings in the natural harbour of Scapa Flow in Orkney, off the North-east coast of Scotland in late June 1919. Though initially written off by the British Admiralty as unsalvageable, the recent rises in the price of scrap metal had changed the value of the wrecks to the extent that they would now be profitable to lift, based on Cox&#x27;s estimates of the quantity of high quality Krupp steel armour alone, before taking into account non-ferrous salvage.

Ignoring expert opinion, his initial investment was to buy from the Admiralty the rights to salvage two battlecruisers – and – and twenty six destroyers. The two heavy ships were both accessible from the surface; &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was often mistaken for a small island as her port flank stuck perhaps six metres out of the water, and &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was upright with her decks awash. Cox&#x27;s idea was to raise the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and use its twenty-six thousand ton hull as a floating platform from which to enable salvage of the other ships. This was ultimately to prove impractical, as several attempts to lift the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; ended in failure, due to the hulk&#x27;s instability and the likelihood of its capsizing whilst being pumped out, as it was sitting on rock and not shingle as had been first supposed.

He took his reparation ex-German floating dock, once used for U-Boat testing and sectioned it lengthwise to salvage the first of his destroyers, which was then cleaned and converted into a floating workshop. His team was composed of local labour supporting a core of hired divers and skilled salvage men from all over Scotland; after some practice they were raising a destroyer every four to six weeks, with the fastest lift being accomplished in just four days. Heartened by this, Cox bought the rights to the remainder of the sunken fleet, and proceeded to lift the battlecruiser which was upside down in shallow water with her keel at the surface at low tide. Adapting the advice of Italian salvage experts who had raised an upside down ship from the bottom of Taranto Harbour, Cox raised the ship inverted by filling it with air. It was then lightened and towed to Rosyth on the Firth of Forth for scrapping, Cox having sold the hulk to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company for its weight in scrap. This basic technique would be used repeatedly on many ships of the fleet. Divers would descend to each wreck and perform work such as closing and dogging bulkhead hatches and fastening timber backed plate-steel patches over holes. Then air would be pumped in from air compressors at the surface. In some cases where the hulls themselves could not be made close enough to air-tight, pontoons were used, similarly being filled with air, and ballast was sunk alongside the sunken ships and then secured to them to counterbalance them for lifting.

It was during this stage of the project that his venture suffered a severe blow; the price of scrap metal collapsed, finally stabilising at a quarter of its previous value. Whilst sufficient profit remained to ensure a chance of breaking even, the sunken fleet no longer represented the cash rich harvest that it once had. Indeed, the price of scrap remained depressed until 1937, well after Cox had effectively retired from salvage.

A plain spoken and often blunt man, Cox was known for his explosive temper; he was respected by his workers as being brilliant, hard working and stubborn to the point of pig-headedness. He did not spare either his workers or himself during the eight years he remained at Scapa Flow. He kept his business afloat by common sense and good judgement, such as the salvage of coal from the wreck of the &quot;Seydlitz&quot; to provide fuel for his machinery during the General Strike of 1926. This was balanced by acts of ego, such as the re-sinking of the &quot;Seydlitz&quot; after it had been successfully lifted early, as he had arranged for the press to be present on the day that it had been scheduled to be raised. Considered a &#x27;showman&#x27; by his contemporaries, Cox was happy to allow the recording of some of the works in progress at Lyness on the Island of Hoy by reporters and photographers, including film shot for newsreel. Some of these can still be found on YouTube; Cox is visible in most of them, an active figure, incongruously dressed in tweeds.

By May 1932, Cox had raised the battlecruisers SMS &quot;Moltke&quot;, SMS &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, , and SMS &quot;Hindenburg&quot;; the battleships and , and the light cruiser .

After personally witnessing fatal accidents on the wreck of the White Star liner , and additional accidents whilst raising the &quot;Von der Tann&quot; and fatalities on the &quot;Prinzregent Luitpold&quot;, during 1932 Cox sold the marine salvaging side of his business to Alloa Shipbreaking, and retired from marine salvage. The &quot;Prinzregent Luitpold&quot; was the last ship that he raised in Orkney, despite having bought the rights to salvage , sunk at Scapa in 20 fathoms.

Cox remained a consultant to the British Admiralty on matters of deep water salvage, and undertook their side of the work in the raising in 1932 of the old battleship , contracted to the Alloa Shipbreaking, which the Admiralty had used as a target ship and sunk by mistake.

Cox was frequently assumed to be a poor businessman who did not understand business efficiency, and admitted to being inexperienced in the difficulties of ship raising. But he also suffered from an astonishing amount of bad luck during his eight years at Scapa Flow. Accidents that were as much the fault of the elements as of human error had plagued the salvage. An imaginative man, he learned quickly, overcoming the frequently appalling weather to which the area is prone, which when coupled to the fact that no two lifts are ever the same may have dissuaded or broken a lesser man. The rise and fall of the price of scrap frequently ate up the best of his profits during the long salvage operation. The major slump in the price of scrap during 1924 was only really reversed by 1937, in time for his successors Alloa Shipbreaking to capitalise on their investment (the hull of the SMS &quot;Friedrich der Grosse&quot; alone was valued at £130,000 following salvage that year). Despite all this, he was considered a fair, if firm, and above all popular employer. His yard at Lyness on the Orkney Island of Hoy employed 200 workers at the peak of his business, and he was noted for granting holidays with pay during times of financial hardship.

==Later life==
After selling his business, Cox spent the remainder of his days supporting charities, and giving lectures on deepwater salvage, including the High Seas Fleet.

In failing health, Ernest Cox died in 1959 at the age of seventy-six.

<text>Sidney Alderman Blackmer (July 13, 1895 – October 6, 1973) was an American Broadway and film actor active between 1914 and 1971, usually in major supporting roles.

== Biography ==
Blackmer was born and raised in Salisbury, North Carolina, the son of Clara Deroulhac (née Alderman) and Walter Steele Blackmer. He started in the insurance and financial counseling business but abandoned it. While working as a construction laborer on a new building, he saw a Pearl White serial being filmed and immediately decided to pursue acting as a career. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Blackmer had a role in the highly popular serial &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1914), his film debut.

In 1929, he returned to motion pictures and went on to appear as a major character actor in more than 120 films.

He won the 1950 Tony Award for Best Actor (Drama) for his role in the Broadway play &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, co-starring with Shirley Booth.

In film, Blackmer had a role as the conniving Manhattan warlock Roman Castevet in the guise of one of many overly solicitous elderly neighbors of the pregnant titular character (played by Mia Farrow) in the Academy Award-winning 1968 Roman Polanski film, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;.

A humanitarian, Blackmer served as the national vice president of the United States Muscular Dystrophy Association. He also helped found the North Carolina School of the Arts. In 1972, he was honored with the North Carolina Award in the Fine Arts category. It is the State of North Carolina&#x27;s highest civilian award. On his death in 1973, Blackmer was interred in the Chestnut Hill Cemetery in his hometown of Salisbury, North Carolina.

== Personal life ==
For his contributions to the film industry, Blackmer has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1625 Vine Street.

<doc id="901858" wikidata="Q4418003" url="?curid=901858" title="Network element">
<text>In computer networks, a network element is a manageable logical entity uniting one or more physical devices. This allows distributed devices to be managed in a unified way using one management system. 

According to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the term &quot;&#x27;network element&quot;&#x27; refers to a facility or to equipment used in the provision of a telecommunications service. This term also refers to features, functions, and capabilities that are provided by means of such facility or equipment. This includes items such as subscriber numbers, databases, signaling systems, and information that is sufficient for billing and collection. Alternatively, it&#x27;s also included if it&#x27;s used in the transmission, routing, or other provision of a telecommunications service.

==Background==

With development of distributed networks, network management had become an annoyance for administration staff. It was hard to manage each device separately even if they were of the same vendor. Configuration overhead as well as misconfiguration possibility were quite high. A provisioning process for a basic service required complex configurations of numerous devices. 
It was also hard to store all network devices and connections in a plain list. Network structuring approach was a natural solution.

==Examples==

With structuring and grouping, it is very well seen that in any distributed network there are devices performing one complex function. At that, those devices can be placed in different location. 
A telephone exchange is the most typical example of such a distributed group of devices. It typically contains subscriber line units, line trunk units, switching matrix, CPU and remote hubs. 
A basic telephone service leans on all those units, so it is convenient for an engineer to manage a telephone exchange as one complex entity encompassing all those units inside.

Another good example of a network element is a computer cluster. A cluster can occupy a lot of space and may not fit one datacenter. For enterprise solutions, it is common to locate cluster nodes in different locations, even in different regions (settlements).

==Maintenance==

In general, an NE can generate two types of maintenance information: 
:#Information related to the quality or health of the transmission signal, and 
:#Information related todata its own internal hardware/software integrity. 

The functional components of surveillance are performance monitoring and alarm/status monitoring, also known as alarm surveillance. In the national and international standards area for telecommunications operations, performance monitoring and alarm surveillance are classified as subcategories of the more general system management functional categories of performance management and fault management, respectively.
Maintenance consists of both preventive and corrective procedures that are designed to (a) prevent troubles and identify potential troubles before they affect service, and (b) detect a network failure that impacts performance and make the appropriate repairs. A typical seven-step maintenance process consists of:

:#Trouble Detection – Detect trouble by continuous monitoring, periodic tests, per-call or other pre-action tests, or other automatic processes. 
:#Trouble Notification – Send notification of a specific event or condition to a local display or Operations System (OS). Trouble notifications include output messages and visual and audible alarms.
:#Service Recovery – Minimize the degradation of service by automatic or manual protection actions.
:#Trouble Verification – Determine whether the reported condition still exists.
:#Trouble Isolation – Isolate the trouble to its source, preferably to a single field-repairable element, e.g., circuit pack.
:#Repair – Fix or replace the faulty element.
:#Repair Verification and Return to Service – Verify that the trouble has been fixed and return the element to service.

Telcordia GR-474 establishes trouble-detecting and reporting criteria for signal transmission failures and internal hardware or software anomalies. GR-474 provides proposed generic requirements that pertain to the Fault and Performance Management functions in transport and switching NEs used for alarm surveillance and control.

GR-474 complements recent criteria in industry standards such as ITU-T Recommendation M.3100, G.707, and G.709, and ANSI T1.

==State models==

A network element state model facilitates cross domain network management and promotes a multi-vendor environment. The standard definitions and mappings allow Operations Systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports.

Telcordia GR-1093 discusses the two primary state models in industry. One is the Telcordia State Model, which consolidates the state models previously described in several Telcordia documents. By consolidating the models, changes and expansions to the models can be presented and can evolve in a coordinated fashion. Also, inconsistencies and redundancy may be averted. The other model is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) State Model, which is defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.731.

The state of an entity represents the current condition of availability of the underlying resource or service in the NE from the point of view of management. In the context of the Telcordia State Model, the term &quot;entity&quot; represents an entry in a TL1 administrative view (i.e., represents the resource or service generally identified by the Access Identifier [AID] parameter). In the context of the ISO State Model, the term &quot;entity&quot; means &quot;managed object&quot;.

Different types of entities (such as hardware, transport facilities, and subscriber service) have a variety of state characteristics that express the availability of their underlying resources that are specific to each entity type. However, a state model is expected to be common to a large number of types of entities. It expresses key aspects of their availability at any given time. The purpose of the state model is to indicate the availability of an entity in providing its functions and, if an entity is not available, to indicate the cause of the unavailability and what kind of activity may be taken by the manager (e.g., the OS or the craft) to make the entity available.

In a specific application, only a subset of the state model may be needed. The rationale of such restrictions is not described in GR-1093. The technology or application-specific requirements document should be consulted for this information.

The standard definitions and mappings allow Operations Systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports.

To help ensure interoperability, particularly for an OS that interfaces with multiple NEs using one of the two state models, a mapping between the models may be needed. GR-1093 provides a mapping for the two models and also defines the extension to the OSI state/status attributes that is necessary to meet the telecommunications needs of the service providers.

==Telecommunications Management Network==

A concept of the network element as a distributed entity is widely used in TMN model which in turn is used as a standard for developing element management systems.

<text>Thomas Fallon (1825–1885) an Irish-born Californian politician, best known for serving as 10th Mayor of San Jose. Fallon remains a controversial figure in San Jose&#x27;s history, owing to his role in the American Conquest of California.

==Biography==
Fallon&#x27;s family moved to Canada when he was a child. At age 18, he was in St. Louis and joined the third expedition of John C. Frémont to California. Early in 1846, Fallon stayed in Santa Cruz after Frémont visited the area. In June 1846, he raised a group of 22 Santa Cruz-area volunteers to join Fremont, appointing himself captain. When the Mexican–American War began in California with Commodore John D. Sloat&#x27;s capture of Monterey on July 7, Fallon&#x27;s force crossed the Santa Cruz Mountains to capture the El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe (now the City of San José) without bloodshed, on July 11. On July 14, 1846 he received an American Flag from Sloat, which he raised over the &quot;juzgado&quot; of San Jose, the pueblo&#x27;s administrative building. Fallon&#x27;s volunteers then joined Fremont&#x27;s California Battalion for the remainder of the war.

After the war, Fallon returned briefly to San Jose, then back to Santa Cruz where he established a business as a saddler. At the beginning of the California Gold Rush in 1848, Fallon took a cargo of iron picks made in Santa Cruz to sell to the gold miners. With his share of the profits, he built a combination residence/workshop/hotel on the Mission plaza in Santa Cruz (where the mission chapel replica stands now). In 1849, he married María del Carmen Cota (1827–1923), commonly called Carmelita, daughter of local landowner Martina Cota Castro (1807–1890) and her first husband Corporal Simon Cota, owners of Rancho Soquel. Carmel inherited one-tenth of Rancho Soquel, 3400 acres of land.

In 1852, Fallon sold his plaza property to the County of Santa Cruz for use as a courthouse. Shortly thereafter, Thomas and Carmel moved their family to Texas. Following the death of their children, they returned to San Jose. In San Jose, Fallon began buying land in the area and built the Fallon House (1855) in Downtown San Jose. The house is preserved as a museum, across from the Peralta Adobe. In 1856, Fallon was elected to the San Jose Common Council. In 1857, he was elected to the city&#x27;s Board of Trustees (which had replaced the Common Council) for one year. He was a council-elected Mayor of San Jose in 1859, and served a single one-year term.

According to one account, in 1876 (after 26 years of marriage) Carmel found Thomas and the family maid in a compromising position, and filed for divorce. Carmel used the divorce settlement to build several hotels and other buildings, including the Carmel Fallon Building (1894) at 1800 Market Street in San Francisco, now part of the San Francisco LGBT Community Center. Thomas Fallon died in San Francisco in 1885.

==Legacy==
In the 1980s, San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery had the city commission a statue of Fallon raising the U.S. flag in San Jose at a cost of over $800,000. The statue was completed in 1988, and was scheduled to be located in the City Park Plaza (now known as Plaza de César Chávez) near the site of the flag raising. However local groups, including Hispanic Americans, protested that Fallon represented American imperialism and repression of the Mexican population. The statue was stored until 2002, when it was finally displayed in Pellier Park northwest of the original proposed location, near Julian and St. James Streets.

In 2020, such criticisms were revived in the aftermath to the murder of George Floyd and more specifically to the grand jury&#x27;s decision over the shooting of Breonna Taylor. On the day of the grand jury&#x27;s decision and following evening, peaceful protests occurred in San Jose around the same area where the statue is located. However, some protesters surrounded the statue, vandalized it including with anti-police messages, and then set it on fire. Then San Jose mayor Sam Liccardo talked with historians and community leaders and residents on what to do with the statue. It was ultimately removed April 24, 2023. The city will keep it unless a museum or educational institution requests it.

<text>Tana Toraja ( &#x27;Toraja Land&#x27; in Toraja language) is a landlocked regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) of South Sulawesi Province of Indonesia, and home to the Toraja ethnic group. It covers an area of and had a population of 221,081 at the 2010 census and 280,794 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2022 was 291,046 (comprising 150,655 males and 140,391 females), but the official figure for mid 2023 was a much reduced total of 257,901 (comprising 132,284 males and 125,617 females). 

The local government seat is in the town of Makale, while the traditional center of Toraja culture is in Rantepao. Formerly, the Tana Toraja area covered a larger area, but on 24 June 2008 this was divided into two regencies, consisting of Tana Toraja with its capital at Makale and Toraja Utara (North Toraja) with its capital at Rantepao.

The Tana Toraja boundary was determined by the Dutch East Indies government in 1909. In 1926, Tana Toraja was under the administration of the Bugis state, Luwu. The &quot;regentschap&quot; (or regency) status was given on 8 October 1946, the last regency given by the Dutch. Since 1984, Tana Toraja has been named as the second tourist destination after Bali by the Ministry of Tourism, Indonesia. Since then, hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors have visited this regency. In addition, numerous Western anthropologists have come to Tana Toraja to study the indigenous culture and people of Toraja.

== History ==
The government in Toraja has been started since the government Dutch East Indies. Based on the Emergency Law No. 3 of 1957, the District Level II Tana Toraja was formed which was inaugurated on 31 August 1957 with the first Regent of the Regional Head named Lakitta.

Decree of the Governor of the First Level Region of South Sulawesi Number 954/XI/1998 dated 14 December 1998, the district of Tana Toraja consisted of 9 definitive districts, 6 district representatives, 22 districts, and 63 villages. Then Law No. 22/1999 on Regional Government was issued, and followed up by issuing Regional Regulation No. 18 of 2000 dated 29 December 2000, 6 district representatives were changed to definitive districts, bringing the total number of districts to 15 definitive districts, 22 districts and 63 villages.

In 2001, the regional regulation no. 2 of 2001 dated 11 April 2001 provided for the entire description of the existing &quot;village&quot; to changed their names to &quot;lembang&quot;. After the stipulation of Regional Regulation No. 2 of 2001 concerning the First Amendment to Regional Regulation No. 18 of 2000, the Regional Regulation of Tana-Toraja Regency Number 8 of 2004 concerning the second amendment to the Regional Regulation Number 18 of 2000, as well as the regional regulation number 6 of 2005 concerning the amendment of the Third Regional Regulation Number 18 of 2000, the Tana Toraja Regency area developed into 40 administrative districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), subdivided into 87 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 223&quot; lembang&quot; (rural villages).

Next came the discourse of regional expansion, namely North Toraja Regency. The discourse of the expansion has created pros and cons among the Toraja people themselves. The formation of North Toraja Regency was finally determined through the plenary session of the People&#x27;s Representative Council on 24 June 2008. However, the inauguration of North Toraja Regency was carried out two months later, which was coupled with the commemoration of the 51st anniversary of Tana Toraja Regency, namely on 31 August 2008.

== Geography ==
Tana Toraja is centrally placed in the island of Sulawesi, 300 km north of Makassar, the provincial capital of South Sulawesi. It lies between latitude of 2°-3° South and longitude 119°-120° East (center: ). The total area (since the separation of the new regency of North Toraja) is 2,043.62 km2, about 4.5% of the total area of South Sulawesi province. The topography of Tana Toraja is mountainous; its minimum elevation is 150 m, while the maximum is 3,083 above the sea level.

== Administrative Districts ==
Tana Toraja Regency comprises nineteen administrative Districts (&quot;Kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the administrative centres of the districts, the numbers of administrative villages within each district (totaling 47 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 112 rural &quot;desa&quot;), and its post code.

Notes: (a) includes one &quot;kelurahan&quot;. (b) comprising 4 &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 13 &quot;desa&quot;. (c) comprising 3 &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 9 &quot;desa&quot;. (d) including 2 &quot;kelurahan&quot;. &lt;br&gt;(e) comprising 14 &quot;kelurahan&quot; and one &quot;desa&quot;. (f) comprising 4 &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 4 &quot;desa&quot;. (g) all 5 are &quot;kelurahan&quot;. (h) comprising 3 &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 3 &quot;desa&quot;.

== Demographics ==
=== Ethnicity ===
The original tribe that inhabits Tana Toraja is the Toraja tribe. The Toraja people are a tribe who live in the mountainous region of the northern part of the province of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The population of the Toraja people is estimated at around 1 million people, and 500,000 of them are in Tana Toraja Regency, North Toraja Regency, and Mamasa Regency. Most of the Toraja people embrace Christianity, while some adhere to Islam and an animist belief known as Aluk Todolo. The Indonesian government has recognized this belief as part of the Hindu religion.

The word Toraja itself comes from the Bugis language, namely &quot;to riaja&quot; which means &quot;people who live in the land above&quot;. In 1909, the Dutch colonial government called this tribe the Toraja. The Toraja tribe is famous for its funeral rituals, Tongkonan traditional houses and also various types of wood carvings typical of Toraja. Toraja funeral rituals are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting for several days.

Before the 20th century, the Toraja tribe still lived in autonomous villages. They previously still adhered to animism, and had not been touched by the outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries arrived and began to spread Christianity. Then, around the 1970s, Toraja people began to open up to the outside world, and Tana Toraja district (before it was expanded) became a symbol of Indonesian tourism. Then there was the development of Tana Toraja tourism, and it was studied by anthropology. So that in 1990-1s, the Toraja people underwent a cultural transformation, from a society with traditional and agrarian beliefs, to a society that was predominantly Christian, and the tourism sector in the Tana Toraja area continued to increase.

=== Religion ===
Based on data from the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2021, it is noted that a large majority of Tana Toraja&#x27;s population (85.94%) adhered to Christianity, including 69.49% following Protestantism and 16.45% Roman Catholicism. Most of the remaining population (12.17%) followed Islam, with smaller minorities adhering to Hinduism (1.71%) and Buddhism (0.17%) and other faiths (0.01%).

== Tourism ==
=== Tourist attractions ===
The life of the indigenous people, namely the Toraja people, as well as a unique culture, makes this highland area in South Sulawesi chosen by tourists to see and learn Toraja culture.

In 1974, Tongkonan Siguntu&#x27; dirara (traditional ceremony / Rambu Tuka&#x27;) was attended by delegates from 60 foreign countries who attended the PATA conference in Jakarta in 1974. Since then Toraja has become known as a cultural tourism destination in Indonesia.

=== Buntu Kalando ===
Tongkonan/house where Puang Sangalla&#x27; (king of Sangalla&#x27;) lives. As the resting place of Puang Sangala&#x27; and also the palace where the government of the Sangalla&#x27; kingdom was managed at that time, Tongkonan Buntu Kalando had the title &quot;tando tananan langi&#x27; lantangna Kaero tongkonan layuk&quot;. Currently Tongkonan Buntu Kalando is used as a museum to store prehistoric objects and relics of the Sangalla kingdom.

=== Kambira ===
The graves of babies whose teeth have not yet grown (aged 6 months and under) are placed in a living tree that is hollowed out.

=== Pallawa ===
Tongkonan Pallawa is one of the tongkonan or traditional house that is very interesting and is located among the bamboo trees at the top of the hill. The tongkonan is decorated with a number of buffalo horns that are plugged in the front of the traditional house. Located about 12 km to the north of Rantepao.

=== Lemo ===
The place is often referred to as the home of the spirits. At the Lemo cemetery, we can see corpses kept in the open air, in the middle of steep rocks. This burial complex is a blend of death, art and ritual. At certain times the clothes of the corpses will be changed through the Ma&#x27; Nene ceremony.

Located on Burake Hill, Tana Toraja has built the Statue of Jesus Christ Blessing which is claimed to be the tallest Jesus statue in the world. This means that the location of the statue is at an altitude of 1100 meters above sea level or the location of the tallest statue in the world, while the size of the statue itself is not the highest in the world.

== Conservation efforts ==
Tana Toraja is one of the conservation sites for the PROTO MELAYU AUSTRONESIAN cultural civilization which is still well-maintained today. Traditional culture, music, dance, oral literary arts, language, houses, carvings, weaving and culinary which are still very traditional, have made the Indonesian government strive for Tana Toraja to be known internationally, one of which is to nominate Tana Toraja to UNESCO for became a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009.

This is supported by Japan to make Tana Toraja a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Japan itself will participate in the conservation efforts, especially related to traditional houses in the area.

This support was conveyed in a meeting between the Indonesian and Japanese delegations in Poznan, Poland, Saturday 11 November 2010. September 10 in Poznan attended by representatives from about 40 countries in Asia and Europe.

<doc id="901867" wikidata="Q3620914" url="?curid=901867" title="Apple Open Collaboration Environment">
<text>Apple Open Collaboration Environment (AOCE) is a collection of messaging-related technologies introduced for the Classic Mac OS in the early 1990s. It includes the PowerTalk mail engine, which is the primary client-side interface to the system, the PowerShare mail server for workgroup installations, and a number of additional technologies such as Open Directory, encryption, and digital signature support.

AOCE and PowerTalk were heavily marketed between 1993 and 1996, but the hardware requirements meant that most users couldn&#x27;t even install or use it. Developers were likewise stymied by the complex system, and since the installed base was so small their potential sales were even smaller. In 1996, Apple Computer quietly dropped its efforts to market AOCE, and the project quickly disappeared.

==History==

Development of AOCE started in 1989, largely the &quot;pet project&quot; of Apple Fellow Gursharan Sidhu, formerly engineering lead at Apple for LaserWriter, AppleShare, and related networking products.

===Objective===

The project started by looking at existing mail systems and trying to find common concepts and problems. The team also found problems with existing email systems. They tended to support plain text mail only, and rarely supported non-English characters. Support for mobile users was poor, often relying on third party workarounds that were of dubious reliability. And they were all based on a dedicated email server that was typically complex to set up, and often excessive for small installations with only a few people in an office.

None of the existing products could give the user what they really wanted: a single universal mailbox and a single universal address book. In this pre-Internet era, savvy users often had mailboxes on their corporate network, online services such as CompuServe or AppleLink, and perhaps also a number of bulletin board systems (BBSs). Each email system used its own standards for collecting and storing information, which required users to run multiple clients to access the different services. Although a single-mailbox system could be constructed by administrators with the use of email gateways, these tended to be expensive and technically challenging to maintain.

===Solutions===

At one end of the system, AOCE focuses on the underlying delivery and addressing systems, generalizing the email concept so the system can be used to deliver anything from email to word processor documents to print jobs. Addressing was another issue the market was struggling with, so AOCE offers a single universal addressing mechanism and address book, one that could support not only people&#x27;s email addresses, but the addresses of things like printers and fax machines as well. These could be looked up in an interface much easier to use than the existing Macintosh solution, the Chooser.

AOCE normally store users&#x27; email on each personal computer, as opposed to a server. This not only allows the user to read mail offline, but also removes the need for a single machine with huge storage space. Small networks can be set up simply by installing the standard client software; the machines discover each other on AppleTalk and communicate directly. AOCE understands that users are not always connected to the network, so outbound mail is cached on the sender&#x27;s machine until both the sender and recipient are online. Even on a LAN this is valuable, as many users turn off their computers at night and the mail would must wait until the next morning for delivery.

Since the mail is stored locally, users with laptop computers are able to read and compose mail while mobile. Everything automatically updates upon reconnection to the office LAN. AppleTalk Remote Access, Apple&#x27;s standard implementation of AppleTalk over modems, provides remote sync.

For security over the potentially open phone lines, all communications can be secured using RSA encryption and digital signing, even on the local network. Additionally, the Keychain stores various login credentials in an encrypted file. This allows the users to use a different username and password on the various systems, placing them in the keychain database for secure storage. This requires only a single password for the keychain; AOCE can retrieve the credentials for a particular service on demand.

Users can share documents directly simply by dropping the address on the document, or vice versa, bypassing a message at all – the document would arrive automatically in the other user&#x27;s mailbox. Delivery of email (which in this scenario is nothing more than a text document in a specialized format), or of anything else, was handled entirely by plugins, allowing the user to collect mail from all of their sources into a single inbox.

An optional server can be installed for performance and maintenance needs for those sites that required it. In this case any attempted delivery would be intercepted immediately by the server, thereby avoiding delays if the recipient was not online. The server then delivers the message on behalf of the sender when the recipient connects online.

The AOCE project suffered from what is known as second-system effect, where engineers spend considerable time designing a system that does everything. Invariably these projects fail as the demands are not only incredibly difficult to meet, but often fail to meet real user needs. Often the ideas themselves are good, but buried inside unusable implementations.

===Release===

By early 1993 the client side of AOCE was nearing completion, which was then referred to as PowerTalk. Apple started a pre-release marketing campaign, telling larger customers and even third party email vendors that AOCE would soon arrive and change the market completely. Their claim was that nothing else would be able to compete with its usability, power, and lack of maintenance overhead – all hallmarks of the Apple way.

The system was first widely shown at the Macworld Expo in Boston in mid-1993. At the show the developers found that the choice of naming was unwise, due to confusion between PowerTalk and Apple&#x27;s new voice recognition system, PlainTalk.

AOCE was publicly released in September 1993, part of the System 7 Pro bundle that also includes AppleScript utilities.

===Deployment===

When the product finally shipped after years of hype, users were dismayed to find that to install it requires a machine with 2.5 MB of RAM minimum, and needed 4 MB to run well. This is the maximum available RAM in many Mac systems of the era. Removing unneeded components do little to address this, and AOCE and the other Apple technology, QuickDraw GX, typically could not be run together because of a lack of memory. While newer machines were able to run AOCE more comfortably, as an email system intended to be run on diverse networks of heterogeneous machines the requirements greatly impaired market acceptance. Simply downloading and installing separate stand-alone client applications for each mail system the user actually had would use considerably less disk space, and had no constant memory footprint.

While PowerTalk was generally an interesting system, a combination of design features made it frustrating to use. For instance, the addressing system is so deeply embedded into the core of the system that simply typing in a new address is an ordeal. First the user clicks on a button, selects the address type, types it in, and then finally clicks codice_1 to have it appear in the message. Disk usage is also a problem because each message is stored as a separate file, requiring 1 kB or more of space in an era where 40 MB and 80 MB disks are still common. Thus a few hundred messages are enough to fill the free space on the drive. Backing up email was likewise almost impossible as a side-effect of the design; the mail was spread out over the network, some of it remote and inaccessible.

The system could not know who a user was, because the single-user Mac OS 7 does not require users to log in. Thus documents had to be delivered to a user&#x27;s machine. This does not work well when the user has two or more machines, making the concept of a universal mailbox difficult to achieve in practice.

Even the remote access functionality is doomed by feature interaction. To ensure that all messages are delivered in a reasonable time on a network where machines might appear and disappear at random (when they are turned on and off), AOCE has a 15-minute timeout in which it repeatedly tries to deliver pending messages. If the user is using a dialup connection on a modem, AOCE keeps the line open for a full 15 minutes before giving up on disconnected user, driving up long distance bills to deliver a potentially tiny message.

Many of these problems were intended to be solved with the PowerShare server, which acts as an always-on, always responsive super-peer. The basic AOCE protocol notices these machines when attempting delivery, and sends to them first, thereby eliminating the delays and centralizing storage and maintenance. The server was not ready in time for the release, and did not ship for another year. When it did it was likewise slow and resource hungry, largely a side effect of various features of the Mac OS that makes it unsuitable for server applications—a role for which it was never designed in the first place.

=== Cancellation ===

AOCE had one year at Apple&#x27;s Worldwide Developers Conference in 1995 when it was finally selling, but by this point, the market was moving toward SMTP-based Internet mail as a universal format. By 1996 Apple had given up on AOCE, and started talking about the CyberDog project based on the OpenDoc platform. AOCE is not supported in Mac OS 7.6.

==Overview==

AOCE&#x27;s Open Directory and related software introduced the concept of directory entries (such as business cards) as first-class desktop objects. This is used to create a drag-and-drop metaphor for mail, fax, and other directory-based activities. Each endpoint, a mail server for instance, is driven by a plug-in extension that is driven by a common AOCE-supplied queue and queue viewer. PowerTalk provides a set of standard forms for interacting with the items in the queues, and a common interface for mail, and a universal mailbox. Encryption is supported by a single keychain that remembered all your passwords and digital signatures, encrypting them together so only a single password needed to be remembered.

The system was designed in an era when there were many email formats and services, including online services such as CompuServe and AppleLink, networking standards like X.400 and SMTP (Internet mail), and LAN-based servers such as Microsoft Mail and QuickMail. In order to support this diverse environment, AOCE includes a robust layered protocol stack that, in theory, can be used with practically any store-and-forward type of environment. This is used within AOCE not only to service mail, but faxes, printing and even directly sending files from one machine to another without enclosing them in a mail message or needing a file server.

Adoption of AOCE among third party developers was slow due to a complicated API. The book documenting the system is larger than all of the books describing the rest of the pre-System 7 Macintosh combined. Adding a simple feature like &quot;mail this document&quot; to an application requires wading through hundreds of pages of documentation, and writing a core AOCE component is many times more complex.

Several parts of the AOCE engine are useful on their own, such as the Keychain. However, in order to get the keychain, the user must install all of AOCE, a cost the users were not willing to pay. Many years later the keychain was finally shipped as a stand-alone component in Mac OS 9. The encryption and signing support is arguably also useful (although not widely deployed), and it reappeared in Apple&#x27;s bundled Mail application starting with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar in August 2002.

==Reception==
In August 1994, Mel Beckman of &quot;MacWorld&quot; gave AOCE one star out of five, citing profoundly poor usability, documentation, hardware resource requirements, and telephone technical support. A network administrator of five years, Beckman failed to even properly send email after three dedicated days, saying &quot;setting up and maintaining a PowerShare server is not a chore for the fainthearted&quot; with daily tasks being &quot;odious&quot;.

<doc id="901869" wikidata="Q6569251" url="?curid=901869" title="Martha Summerhayes">
<text>Martha Summerhayes (October 21, 1844 – May 12, 1926) was an American memoirist. 

She was a Nantucket, Massachusetts, native who later on in life immigrated to Arizona. A well travelled and educated woman, Summerhayes spent two years, from 1871 to 1873, studying literature in Germany. Her passion for writing took her into a career as a writer. She became well known as a writer in Massachusetts, but she usually did her writing during the winter, which, in turn, led to her becoming interested in the warmer weather of Arizona. 

In 1873, she married soldier John Wyer Summerhayes, a veteran of the American Civil War. 

Wyer Summerhayes was still in the military when the couple married, so Martha further expanded her travels by going with her husband wherever the military sent him when no war was being fought. The Summerhayes arrived at Fort Russell, near Cheyenne, Wyoming, shortly after marrying. In 1874, they were sent by the military to an Arizona that at the time counted with only about 20,000 inhabitants. They stayed at a ranch owned by Corydon Cooley, a White man who had two Indian wives.

Accommodations at Cooley&#x27;s ranch were quite different from what Martha Summerhayes had experience in the east and Europe. She was also disturbed by the fact that Cooley had two wives. Her observations were published in 1908 in an autobiography named &quot;Vanished Arizona&quot; that details her memories of Arizona and the West before widespread settlement and the experiences of military wives.

Summerhayes travelled, in August 1874, about 200 miles by a steamboat to Fort Mohave from Fort Yuma, enduring temperatures along the Colorado River that soared to 122 degrees. 

Soon after arriving at Fort Mohave, the military and their families loaded their belongings into wagons, heading to Prescott, near where Fort Whipple stood. For Martha Summerhayes, the experience of traveling through the desert was both adventurous and frightening; she was not used to using snake protection before sleep, witnessing dogs being eaten to their deaths by these animals, and other experiences.

Soon after arriving at Prescott, the group of soldiers and their families moved slightly to the north, to Camp Verde.

Martha Summerhayes by this point began to think that the military had better accommodations for prostitutes than they had for the soldiers&#x27; wives themselves. In Camp Verde, she befriended Mrs. George Brayton, who advised her to &quot;Take all you need, and it will get carried along, somehow&quot;. The military group, consisting of 100 people, mostly men, faced a two-month-long trip to Camp Apache, passing by the Mogollon Rim. According to Summerhayes in her autobiography, they were attacked by Indians along the way.

During that era, Apache Indians went twice a week to Camp Apache to be counted and receive food and water. At one point, she noticed that one Apache woman had a disfigured face and that she had lost her nose because she had supposedly committed adultery.

Another time, she was watching a show, when the Apache chief &quot;Diablo&quot; supposedly approached major William Worth and asked him how many ponies would Worth accept in exchange for Worth&#x27;s wife. Again, she attended an Apache show, and she feared for her life when the Indians, painted and wearing feathers, began to jump and shout around fires. She said that they had knives and recalled her fear. Eventually, she was able to leave the show.

During her stay at Camp Apache, she found out that soldiers had also used cruelty in killing Apaches. Once handed a box, she noticed a foul smell coming from it. A soldier told her that the box had rotten cheese, and, in reality, it had the head of an Apache Indian, a fact which she found out about later, because she did not open the box herself. In January 1875, she was by herself as she gave birth to her son Harry. She had to perform various tasks by herself, because there were no nurses around, no running water for her or the newborn, barely any food (she and her baby survived the first days only on vegetables and milk), and, perhaps more importantly, no doctor to attend to them, as the military doctor on base was not well prepared to handle newborns and their mothers.

In April 1875, despite the pleas of Mexicans not to try to travel to Phoenix because of hazards related to warring tribes, the Summerhayes made it to Arizona&#x27;s future capital. Soon after, however, she and her husband, whom she affectionately nicknamed &quot;Jack&quot;, moved back to Nantucket, thinking about baby Harry&#x27;s welfare and about the hot Arizona summers. But they missed Arizona and returned shortly afterwards.

In 1878, the Summerhayes moved to California. This was followed by various other moves which were appointed by the military. After Geronimo&#x27;s campaign was over, the Summerhayes were ordered to Arizona once again. They arrived at Tucson using a Pullman car.

In 1900, her husband retired from the military, and the Summerhayes returned to the East, where they lived in various cities including Washington, D.C., New York and Nantucket. 

After her 1908 autobiography was published, Martha Summerhayes became a celebrity, receiving fan mail from hundreds of people, especially military men and students that valued her view of military. 

Martha Summerhayes died on May 12, 1926, at Schenectady, New York. She and her husband John are buried next to each other, at the Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="901870" wikidata="Q283121" url="?curid=901870" title="Josef Dobrovský">
<text>Josef Dobrovský (17 August 1753 – 6 January 1829) was a Czech philologist and historian, one of the most important figures of the Czech National Revival along with Josef Jungmann.

== Life and work ==
Dobrovský was born at Balassagyarmat, Nógrád County, in the Kingdom of Hungary, when his father Jakub Doubravský (1701, Solnice – 1764, Horšovský Týn) was temporarily stationed as a soldier there. His mother was Magdalena Dobrovská (1733, Čáslav – 1797).

He received his first education in the German school at Horšovský Týn, made his first acquaintance with the Czech language and soon made himself fluent in it at the Německý Brod gymnasium, and then studied for some time under the Jesuits at Klatovy. In 1769 he began to study philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1772 he was admitted among the Jesuits at Brno and was preparing for a Christian mission in India. However, the entire order was dissolved in the Czech lands in 1773 and Dobrovský thus returned to Prague to study theology.

After holding for some time the office of tutor to Count Nostitz, he obtained an appointment first as vice-rector, and then as rector, in the general seminary at Hradisko (now part of Olomouc); but in 1790 he lost his post through the abolition of the seminaries throughout the Habsburg Empire, and returned as a guest to the house of the count. At this time, he wrote some of the most important works in Slavic studies, historiography and philology.

In 1792 he was commissioned by the Bohemian Academy of Sciences to visit Stockholm, Turku, Saint Petersburg and Moscow in search of the manuscripts which had been scattered by the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and on his return he accompanied Count Nostitz to Switzerland and Italy.

In the 1780s Dobrovský participated in the academic life of Prague. In 1784, he helped to set up the Royal Czech Society of Sciences, and in 1818 the National Museum of what was to become Czechoslovakia and eventually the Czech Republic.

However, his reason began to give way in 1795, and in 1801 he had to be confined in a lunatic asylum, but by 1803 he had completely recovered. The rest of his life was mainly spent either in Prague or at the country seats of his friends Counts Nostitz and Czernin, but his death occurred in Brno, where he had gone in 1828 to study in the local libraries.

==Legacy==
Dobrovský remains a revered figure of Czechoslovak intellectual history. He has been subject also to philosophical analysis, for instance by Milan Machovec (in his 1964 monograph).

While his fame rests chiefly on his labours in Slavonic philology his botanical studies are not without value in the history of the science.

Between 1948 and 1968 Czech poet Vladimír Holan lived in the so-called &quot;Dobrovský House&quot; on Kampa, often saying that the &quot;Blue Abbé&quot; (a nickname by which Dobrovský was known) would sometimes visit him.

<doc id="901884" wikidata="Q483539" url="?curid=901884" title="Anaconda, Montana">
<text>Anaconda, county seat of Deer Lodge County, which has a consolidated city-county government, is located in southwestern Montana, United States. Located at the foot of the Anaconda Range (known locally as the &quot;Pintlers&quot;), the Continental Divide passes within south of the community. As of the 2020 census the population of the consolidated city-county was 9,421. As a consolidated city-county area, it ranks as the ninth most populous city in Montana, but as only a city is far smaller.

==History==
Anaconda was founded by Marcus Daly, one of the Copper Kings, who financed the construction of the Anaconda smelter on nearby Warm Springs Creek to process copper ore from the Butte mines. Daly originally named the site &quot;Copperopolis&quot;, but that name was already used by Copperopolis, Montana, a small mining town in Meagher County. Instead, Daly accepted the name &quot;Anaconda&quot;, and on June 25, 1883, Daly filed for a town plat using that name. There exists another story that the name was selected by the United States postmaster of the time, Clinton Moore. However, Moore filed the post office application in October 1883, well after the town plat was filed. When Montana was admitted as a state in 1889, Daly lobbied to have the capital moved to Anaconda, and Montana legislators decided to hold two referendums in 1892 and 1894 to choose a capital city. The campaigns for the referendums were heated, ending with a victory for Helena, the location supported by Daly&#x27;s rival William A. Clark.

In 1903, the Socialist Party of America won its first victory west of the Mississippi when Anaconda voters elected a socialist mayor, treasurer, police judge, and three councilmen. The Socialist Party had grown within the expanding Montana labor movement. Initially, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company tolerated socialist activities, but when the Socialists gained political power and threatened to implement reform, the company systematically undermined the party. City workers and councilmen refused to cooperate with the new mayor, and the company began to fire Socialists. In the long run, labor lost ground in Anaconda and the company exerted ever greater political control.

The Anaconda Company expanded smelting capacity over time; by 1919 the Washoe Reduction Works could boast that its 585-foot (178 m) smokestack (Anaconda Smelter Stack) was the tallest masonry structure in the world and that the smelter-refining complex constituted the world&#x27;s largest non-ferrous processing plant.
In 1980, Atlantic Richfield Company closed the smelter, bringing an end to almost a century of mineral processing. While some aspects of the operation had been cleaned up under environmental laws, closing the smelter resulted in a large area contaminated with hazardous wastes. Since then, an operation for environmental cleanup was put into place by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and executed with the assistance of ARCO. The multimillion-dollar cleanup and redevelopment has resulted in the &quot;Old Works&quot; Golf Course, a championship 18-hole course designed by Jack Nicklaus.

Anaconda joined with Deer Lodge County to form a consolidated city-county government in 1977. Part of Anaconda is included in the Butte-Anaconda Historic District.

==Geography==
Central Anaconda is above sea level, and is surrounded by the communities of Opportunity and West Valley.

==Arts and culture==

On main street is the Washoe Theater, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was the last theater constructed in the United States in the Nuevo Deco style. The theater was designed in 1930 by B. Marcus Priteca, an architect from Seattle and opened in 1936. It was listed by the NRHP for architectural significance in 1982. It currently is used for showing films, plus periodically hosting plays and other types of entertainment.

==Government and politics==

Deer Lodge County voters have a record as the most consistently Democratic county in Montana for Presidential elections. These voters have not supported a Republican candidate since Calvin Coolidge in 1924. In the last five elections before 2016, the Democratic candidate has won by 21% to nearly 49% of Deer Lodge County&#x27;s vote. In gubernatorial elections, the only Republican to carry the county in the last twenty years was Marc Racicot in the 1996 election. In that election the original Democratic nominee, Chet Blaylock, died and Marc Racicot carried every county.

The city is currently in the 39th district of the Montana Senate and is represented by Republican Terry Vermeire in the 2023 legislative session. Anaconda is also in the 77th district of the Montana House of Representatives, which has been represented by Republican John Fitzpatrick since 2023. This is the first time since 1945 that the city has been represented by a Republican in the state House of Representatives.

<text>Mark Levinson is an American high-end audio equipment brand established in 1972 by eponymous founder Mark Levinson, and based in Stamford, Connecticut. It is owned by Harman International Industries, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics.

== History ==
Mark Levinson Audio Systems Ltd. (MLAS) was founded 1972 in Woodbridge, Connecticut (a suburb of New Haven) by Mark Levinson. Original MLAS products were designed by John Curl (Hence the JC abbreviation to many of the early products) under the supervision of Mark Levinson, with a team of associates. Audio pioneer Dick Burwen, Levinson’s first electronics mentor, helped Levinson start the company with the iconic LNP-2 Preamplifier. Chief engineer Tom Colangelo, who brought visionary audio circuitry to the company, died in a tragic car accident in 2007.

By 1980 MLAS was in serious financial trouble. Levinson then asked Sandy Berlin, a retired executive in the audio industry, to invest in MLAS and to aid in the management of the company, which Berlin did, personally investing $480,000 in the company and persuading several others to invest an additional $300,000. At Berlin&#x27;s request, Levinson entered into an Employment Agreement with MLAS from December 1980, under which Levinson agreed to convey to MLAS the permanent and exclusive right, title and interest to the trade name &quot;Mark Levinson&quot;. He also agreed that, should he leave MLAS&#x27; employ, he would not engage in the audio business &quot;anywhere in the world&quot;.

In October 1984, three creditors forced MLAS into bankruptcy and Mark Levinson Audio Systems, Ltd. ceased to exist, with Madrigal Audio Labs acquiring &quot;all of [MLAS&#x27;] equipment, inventory, parts, finished and semi-finished goods, office furniture, blueprints and trademark and tradename rights including those arising under agreement between Mark Levinson and MLAS. 

Since 1990, the Mark Levinson brand and trade name have been property of Harman International Industries. Mark Levinson produces audio amplifiers and digital audio processors that have a characteristic black anodized chassis, a design associated with the brand since the beginning. Harman also makes Mark Levinson audio systems as an optional upgrade for Lexus luxury automobiles. Harman&#x27;s Mark Levinson automotive audio systems are designed in collaboration with sound, electrical, and design engineers who produce Mark Levinson audio electronics.

Certain Lexus models have featured Mark Levinson sound systems as an option since 2001, with prices varying based on the vehicle and its specific components (~US$2,500 for the LS 460, ~US$1,600 for the ES 350, ~US$1,440 for the IS 350, etc.). The first Mark Levinson car 5.1 surround sound system appeared on the Toyota Crown Majesta in 2004. Current US Lexus models available with the Mark Levinson Audio System include: CT200h, IS 250/300h, GS 300h/450h, RC &amp; RC F, NX 300h, RX450h, LS460/600h.

It is bordered to the east by the East Region, to the north by the Centre Region, to the northwest by the Littoral Region, to the west by the Gulf of Guinea (part of the Atlantic Ocean), and to the south by the countries of Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Congo. The South occupies 47,720 km2 of territory, making it the fourth largest region in the nation. The major ethnic groups are the various Beti-Pahuin peoples, such as the Ewondo, Fang, and Bulu.

The South Region has a fair amount of industry, its main commerce consisting of logging, timber, mining, and offshore oil drilling. Commercial agriculture is also important in the South, the major cash crops being cocoa and rubber. Cattle rearing and fishing are significant economic components, as well. Much of the population is made up of subsistence farmers.

==2008 presidential decree abolishes provinces==

In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing &quot;Provinces&quot; and replacing them with &quot;Regions&quot;. Hence, all of the country&#x27;s ten provinces are now known as Regions. This was to be the end of South.

==Geography==

===Land===

The soil of the South is made up primarily of metamorphic rock, particularly gneiss. However, the land is riddled with faults around the border with the Centre Province that arc toward the border with Congo; granite deposits occur along this line. The soil is primarily ferrallitic except for southwestern portions near the border with Equatorial Guinea and moving north to Ebolowa, where it is mixed. Due to high amounts of leaching, the South&#x27;s red earth is only marginally productive.

===Drainage===

Several river systems drain the South Region. The northernmost of these is the Nyong, which forms part of the border with the Littoral. The coastal Ocean division is drained by two rivers, the Lokounje to the north and the Lobé to the south. The Ntem, or Campo, rises in the east of the region and flows along or just north of the southern border to the town of Campo. All of these rivers empty into the Atlantic Ocean.

The Dja and Lobo Rivers flow through the easternmost division of the region, splitting south of Bengbis and encompassing the Dja Reserve. These two rivers form part of the Congo River basin.

===Relief===

The South Region begins at sea level on the coast. The land slowly climbs throughout the Kribi-Douala basin, which averages 300–600 metres in altitude, until it reaches the South Cameroon Plateau with elevations of 500 to 1000 metres above sea level. Rocky promontories on the coast and rolling, tree-covered hills inland characterize the land. The Ntem Massif near Ebolowa is the province&#x27;s highest point at 1400 metres.

===Climate===

The climate of the South Region is Type A or Guinea-type climate. Humidity is high, and precipitation averages 1500–2000 mm per year in the interior and 2000–3000 mm per year in the coastal region. The coast from the north of Kribi south to Ebodjé gets as much as 4000 mm of rain per year. Temperatures are relatively high as well, averaging 24˚ C and 26˚ C from Kribi north along the coast.

In lieu of traditional seasons, the Guinea-type climate affords alternating dry and wet periods. The year begins in a long dry season that lasts from December to May. This is followed by a light wet season from May to June and a short dry season from July to October. A heavy wet season begins around October and lasts through November.

===Plant and animal life===

The South is almost entirely covered in rain forest, the exception being a small tract of mangrove on the coast south of Campo. Much of this land has been intensely exploited for logging, however, allowing sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor and for thick undergrowth to flourish.

Today, the only relatively untouched forest is located in a handful of nature reserves. The Dja Reserve (&quot;Réserve du Biosphère du Dja&quot;) covers 5,260 km² in the northeastern portion of the province and the south-central portion of the neighbouring East. The Campo Reserve (&quot;Réserve du Campo&quot;) covers 2,640 km² in the southwest on the border with Equatorial Guinea. Finally, the Mangame Gorilla Sanctuary (&quot;Sanctuaire à Gorilles de Mangame&quot;) covers 1,224 km² on the Gabon border. In these more virgin areas, the forest is composed of multiple levels. Tall trees about 40 metres high make up the highest stratum. Below these lie smaller, thinner trees with leaves clustered at their tops. The forest bed has very little vegetation as little sunlight penetrates to it.

The southern rain forest supports abundant wildlife, including some of Cameroon&#x27;s last populations of chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants. All of these are becoming increasingly rare due to poaching and deforestation. More numerous are the various monkey, bat, and bird species. Other common animals include pangolins, porcupines and other rodents, and genets.

==Demographics==
===Settlement patterns===

Over 324,000 Cameroonians live in the South Province, and the overall population density is about seven inhabitants per square km. The most populous area is the central region south of Cameroon&#x27;s capital, Yaoundé, in the neighbouring Centre Province and extending south to Ebolowa, west to Kribi, and east to Sangmélima. The rest of the population lives in the villages and towns built around the roads that criss-cross the terrain. In contrast, the vast tracts of jungle that have little or no road access are scarcely populated. The forest area is also plagued by disease-carrying mosquitoes and blackflies that keep settlers away.

Tradition settlements in the Centre are placed along roads, resulting in large numbers of houses near the road with forest beginning directly behind them. The traditional house is a rectangular structure made of mud bricks and thin, wooden or bamboo posts. Roofs were mostly thatched raffia palm in the past, but they are more often made of corrugated aluminium, iron, or tin today.

===People===

The majority of the inhabitants of the South are members of various Bantu tribes that are collectively known as the Beti-Pahuin (&quot;Béti-Pahouin&quot;), the Fang-Beti, or simply the Fang. All of these groups speak various dialects of the Beti language. In addition, most inhabitants of the more populated areas can also speak French.

====Beti-Pahuin====

The Beti portion of the group is primarily situated in the Centre Province, but large numbers of Ewondo and Bane inhabit the Ntem and the Dja and Lobo divisions of the South.

The Fang group lives close to the province&#x27;s southern borders. The Fang proper are inland on the border with Equatorial Guinea and near Djoum. The Ntumu inhabit the area around Ambam, also on the southern border. The Mvang (or Mvae) occupy the regions directly east and west of the Ntumu. These tribal groups have many more members in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Congo.

The Bulu form the third group with about a third of the total Beti-Pahuin population. They are further broken down into the Bulu proper, who inhabit the rich cocoa producing area from Kribi to Ebolowa and east through Sangmélima and Djoum. Inland from Kribi live the Pahuin proper, centered on the villages of Bivouba and Fifinda. The Zaman occupy the valley of the Dja River.

====Other tribes====

Several non-Pahuin tribes also inhabit parts of the South. Several related peoples who speak Makaa–Njem languages live inland a short ways. One of these is the Mabi, who live inland of this around Eboundja. The Ngumba (Numba) tribe inhabits portions of the interior around Bandévouri to Lolodorf. The Mabea (Maboa), also have pockets or territory. Non-Makaa–Njem-speaking groups include the Batanga, who occupy the coastal region from Kribi to Grand Batanga. The Bakolo (Bakolle) are a coastal people north of Kribi, and the Bakola live inland from the border with Equatorial Guinea to Ngumba territory. Most of these tribes have their own distinct languages.

The South is also home to some of Cameroon&#x27;s oldest continuous inhabitants, pygmies of the Baka (Babinga, Bibaya) and Beye&#x27;ele tribes. These hunter-gatherers roam the forests of the region, particularly the area at the center and southeast of the province from Ebolowa to Ambam and Djoum with the Lala on the coast near Lolodorf, Bipindi, and Kribi. These pygmy groups are becoming increasingly sedentary, however, taking up lifestyles very similar to their Beti-Pahuin and Makaa–Njem-speaking neighbours and intermarrying with them.

===Religion===

Presbyterian and Roman Catholic missionaries converted most of the peoples of the region by 1939. Traditional beliefs are still strong, however, and large numbers of people still adhere to various animist beliefs, often in tandem with Christian beliefs. In some areas, such as the village of Mbéle, animists still greatly outnumber Christians.

==Economy==

The South is one of Cameroon&#x27;s most economically robust areas due to its numerous plantations and the tourism generated by its scenic beaches. The area&#x27;s economic stronghold, however, is the port of Kribi, which services the Gulf of Guinea. Campo, near the border with Equatorial Guinea, is another important port.

===Agriculture===

====Sustenance farming====

The majority of farming in the South Province is done on the sustenance level. Plantains are the major crop grown, with cocoyams being common north of Ebolowa. Maize, groundnuts, manioc, yams, beans, and other foodstuffs are raised in more modest quantities.

Traditional farms are placed in forest plots that are cleared with basic tools such as axes, hoes, and machetes. This is done during the dry season, and the resulting brush is then burned, with care taken to preserve any fruit trees. Planting occurs at the start of the wet season. Vegetables and spices are grown close to the house, while tubers such as cassava, cocoyams, and yams are planted with plantains in larger fields further into the forest. Plots are fertilised with farmyard manure. Farmers harvest at the beginning of the next dry season.

These slash and burn methods provide high yields the first year or two, but they eventually drain the soil of fertility. This necessitates the clearing of more farmland every few years, as this exhausted land can remain infertile for up to ten years. This presents little problem in the South&#x27;s more underpopulated areas, but can pose difficulties in areas of higher population density.

====Plantation farming====

The South&#x27;s equatorial climate makes it suitable for large plantations, as well. Cocoa is the major cash crop for the entire region, with 80% of the arable land of Dja and Lobo division and Ocean division dedicated to raising it. Major cocoa collection facilities are located in Ebolowa. Rubber is another important crop, and a major operation is located at Njété, about 20 km inland from Kribi. Palm oil is harvested near Campo.

====Other food sources====

The South is also home to various animal husbandry operations. Poultry farms operate in the towns of Ebolowa and Sangmélima. Modest cattle rearing takes place inland from Kribi, as well, though the area&#x27;s thick forests and the presence of the tsetse fly prevents larger-scale operations. Kribi is also the base for various commercial fishing interests that operate along the province&#x27;s coast.

Rural inhabitants of the South also practice hunting and gathering. Hunters traditionally utilise basic tools such as spears, bows and arrows, knives, and traps. In modern times, guns are increasingly used as well. This latter development has led to a great depopulation of many animal species, especially as demand has risen in urban centers such as Yaoundé for bushmeat from the region.

===Industry===

With ocean access and vast tracts of forest, the South is home to a good deal of industry. Timber is a substantial part of the region&#x27;s economy, and various logging companies have operations in the area. However, because the largest trees within the South itself have mostly been harvested, the region is increasingly being used as a transport network for logging vehicles from Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Congo on their way to the ports of Kribi and Douala. Kribi is also the site of sawmills, and a palm oil mill operates in Lobé. Ebolowa was in past years an important ivory-working center, but government regulations and the scarcity of elephants in modern times have dampened this part of the economy. Much of the South&#x27;s electricity is produced in hydroelectric power stations on the Ntem and Ma&#x27;an rivers.

The South also has a fair amount of mineral wealth. Iron ore is mined near Campo and Kribi. Natural gas is found offshore of Campo, and a Kribi-based plant has been processing this since the 1980s. Perhaps the region&#x27;s most lucrative resource is oil. This, too, is found off the coast of Campo. But more importantly, the South Province is located at the terminus of the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, which was completed in June 2004. The pipe&#x27;s mouth is located just south of Kribi, a fact that promises to bring in high revenues for both Cameroon and the province.

===Transportation===

For a region so heavily forested, the South has a fairly developed transportation network. Four main roads service the greater area of the region. The first of these, National Road 2, runs from Yaoundé to Ambam and then to the border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. National Road 7 is located completely in the South, travelling along the coast from Kribi to Campo. National Road 9 comes south from Yaoundé via Mbalmayo and then to Sangmélima, Djoum, and Mintom. Finally, National Road 17 begins at Sangmélima and goes to Megong before crossing the border to Gabon. Other major roads cover the stretches between Mbalmayo and Ebolowa and between Kribi and Edéa in the Littoral Province. Of these, the route from Edéa to Kribi and from Ebolowa and Sangmélima to Yaoundé are paved. All other roads in the province are dirt, and thus subject to weather conditions.

The South is also accessible via sea and air. The major seaports are Kribi and Campo, though Kribi is busier. Kribi is also the site of the regional airport. There are also airstrips at Ambam, Campo, Ebolowa, and Sangmélima.
===Tourism===

The South sees a good number of tourists due largely to its long, white-sand beaches. These run along the entire coastline, though the easiest to reach are at Kribi and Lobé. Kribi is the most popular destination due to its accessibility from Douala and Yaoundé via paved roads. It is also the largest beachfront town in the South, and it has an active nightlife and several large hotels. Undertow is a significant problem, however, and several bathers drown on Kribi&#x27;s beaches each year, a fact the locals personify as the siren-like &quot;Mami Water&quot;. The undertow at Campo is less dangerous, though the difficult road to reach that town keeps most holiday-seekers away.

Lobé, only a few kilometres south of Kribi, is another popular spot with tourists due to its even more isolated beaches and the picturesque Lobé Falls (&quot;chutes de Lobé&quot;), found where the Lobé River empties into the Atlantic. Local artists and vendors frequent the area around the falls, as do drivers offering to take passengers to Kribi or 65 km further south to see the Lala Pygmy village Elogbatindi, .

In addition, the Cameroonian government is working with various non-governmental organisations to develop ecotourism in the South. These efforts are largely concentrated on the area&#x27;s two major parks, the Dja and Campo Reserves, both of which are bases for various gorilla habituation projects. The Netherlands Development Organisation runs another project that takes travellers to the Campo Reserve and then to traditional homes in Ebodjé, a village 25 km north.
==Administration and social conditions==

With the opening of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline in 2003, the population of the South Region only promises to grow as more industry moves to the area, particularly the coast, making the South an important target for Cameroonian politicians.

President Paul Biya, himself a Bulu from a village near Sangmélima, enjoys widespread support in the South due to its place as the heart of Bululand. However, Biya has often been accused of showing favouritism toward members of the Bulu and closely related Beti groups, and a disproportionate number of Bulu and Beti today work in the civil service, in government posts, or in state-owned businesses. On the other hand, Biya has repeatedly shown intolerance of any opposition from his Bulu-Beti base. In 1996, for example, South Region native and Biya aide Titus Edzoa announced his candidacy for the presidency and was arrested on embezzlement charges, apparently at Biya&#x27;s urging.

===Government===
The capital of the region is Ebolowa, where the presidentially appointed governor has his offices. The region is further divided into four departments (&quot;départements&quot;), also called divisions, each under the supervision of a presidentially appointed prefect (&quot;préfet&quot;) or senior divisional officer.

The Océan department is the farthest west, located on the coast and administered from Kribi. Bordering this are the Vallée-du-Ntem (Ntem-Valley) department, governed from Ambam, and the Mvila department, headed from Ebolowa. Farthest east is the Dja-et-Lobo (Dja and Lobo) department, with Sangmélima its capital.

The Beti-Pahuin and other ethnic groups in the South have little traditional political organisational structure. Instead, groups of families are loosely organised into clans under a single patriarch. During the French colonial period, the Bulu formed a tribal union of their various clans. Today, these elders hold little actual power, and most such positions are merely honorary.

===Education===

There are 972 schools in the territory. Most of these are located in the area&#x27;s larger towns and villages. Attendance numbers diminish as one moves into the area&#x27;s frontiers, particularly the vast, forested areas south of Ebolowa and Sangmélima. Here, students are expected to walk long distances to attend school each day, or else to stay with relatives or alone in towns where schools are located. This problem is not as pronounced at the level of primary school, as these tend to be more widely distributed even in the remoter areas. Nevertheless, all schools in the region tend to be overcrowded.

===Health===

Poor sanitation is perhaps the South Region&#x27;s greatest health hazard. Many villages have no access to running water, and even areas that do have it must contend with outbreaks of amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, brucellosis, giardia, hepatitis A, and schistosomiasis. In 2004, the relatively developed town of Kribi suffered a major cholera epidemic.

As it is almost entirely forested, the South supports many disease-carrying organisms. Malaria-bearing mosquitoes are one such pest, and the disease is a major health hazard in the region. Other parasitic diseases found in the South include dengue fever, falariasis, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever.

Hospitals and clinics are fairly widespread, but they are mostly located in larger towns and cities. Traditional medicine is thus still the major source of treatment for many of the South&#x27;s citizens, particularly those in more remote locations. Witchcraft is still blamed for many maladies, including HIV and AIDS in many cases.

==History==

===Early population movements===

Archaeological finds in the areas of Kribi and Lobé attest to human presence in the territory of the South Province since prehistory. Of the area&#x27;s current inhabitants, the earliest to arrive were the Pygmies, who moved in from further south and east in ancient times and lived for centuries as hunter-gatherers in the forests. The Batanga arrived and settled the coastal areas in the 18th century.

The Beti-Pahuin Bantu groups entered the area in the 19th century from the northeast, south of the Sanaga River. They were under pressure from the migrating Vute, Mbum, Babouti, and Gbaya, who were themselves fleeing the Fulbe (Fula). The Beti-Pahuin were more militarily advanced than the natives they encountered, and they easily subdued and assimilated these peoples or else pushed them away, as with the Ngumba and Mabea, descendants of the Maka and Njem, who had traveled southwest toward the coast when the Beti-Pahuin had first encountered them a century earlier north of the Lom River. The Beti-Pahuin may have practiced cannibalism at this time, as well.

Once across the Sanaga, in present-day East and Centre Provinces, the various tribal groups settled individually in family groups, or clans. The Ntumu, Fang, and Mvae moved toward the Dja valley and into present-day Gabon while the Bulu travelled west along the Nyong to their present territory. The Beti formed the final wave.

===European contacts===

Europeans knew the entire western coast of the present-day South Province since Portuguese ships first explored it in 1472. The Portuguese set up trade with the natives, collecting particularly pepper, ivory, kola nuts, and slaves. Other Europeans followed the Portuguese, and the Dutch became the most active by the 17th century. Minor trading centers emerged, including Kribi and Campo. Trade was carried out on the Europeans&#x27; ships, allowing the coastal tribes to set themselves up as go-betweens, finding slaves from the interior and distributing goods obtained from the Europeans. In fact, the Beti-Pahuin migration was still taking place during this time, allowing the Bulu to set themselves in such a position.

The British supplanted the Dutch as the pre-eminent traders in the region by the 19th century. This was also the period of abolition, and the British sent elements of the Royal Navy in 1827 to the Cameroonian coast to prevent further slave trading. Merchants were instead encouraged to trade in items such as ivory, rubber, and palm kernels. Under the British, trade was conducted on land, and Europeans quickly set up bases along the coast. For example, a trading post was opened in Grand Batanga in 1828 to service the lower Cameroonian coastline. Slaves continued to be traded clandestinely.

===German administration===

Germany annexed the Cameroons in 1884, and for the first few years, they were only interested in the coastal area. Explorers under Governor Julius Von Soden were the first to penetrate into the southern interior when they pushed in to Beti lands in 1887. Eugen Von Zimmerer followed as colonial governor with an aggressive push to build plantations, particularly to grow cocoa. Much of the road infrastructure of the province dates from Von Zimmerer&#x27;s time, since the Germans needed a means of travelling along the coast and from plantation to plantation. It was largely the native population who was forced to build these improvements.

As the Germans consolidated their power and conscripted workers, they faced resistance from the indigenous peoples. Of Cameroon&#x27;s southern groups, the Bulu revolted first in 1891 in protest over their loss to the Germans of their lucrative trade position. Von Zimmerer&#x27;s army finally suppressed the rebellion in 1895. That same year, the Ewondo rose up until the colonials were able to suppress them in 1896. Germany also replaced native chiefs with more sympathetic ones when they deemed it necessary.

Jesko Von Pultkamer became governor of German Kamerun in 1895. He accelerated the creation of plantations through the southern forest zone, which created more need for conscripted native labourers. In 1907, the Ewondo rebelled once more, but the Germans again suppressed them.

===French administration===

In 1916, France gained control of most of Germany&#x27;s Cameroonian territory at the end of World War I. Under French administration, the present South Province fell into the Kribi-Lolodorf-Campo district, governed from Kribi, and the Ebolowa-Akoafim district, governed from Ebolowa.

The French maintained the various German-founded plantations and started new ones, including coffee plantations at Ebolowa, palm plantations at Kribi, and groundnut fields at Batoke. They also continued Germany&#x27;s policy of propping up puppet chiefs of the various native peoples. The French greatly expanded the road network through the region and improved the port at Kribi, albeit still with native forced labour.

===Post-independence===

Upon Cameroon&#x27;s independence in 1960, the present-day Centre and South Provinces were one territory called the Centre-South. In 1982, Paul Biya became the second president of Cameroon. One of his first moves was to separate the Centre-South into the modern Centre and South Provinces in August, 1983.

==Geology==
The West African coast has several structural basins, along with counterparts along the South American margin, which formed during the Late Jurassic to Albian-Cenomanian rifting associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland. During rifting, fluvial and marine clastic rocks plus evaporites were deposited. The Sanaga Sud Field, located in the Douala Basin, was discovered with the Sanaga Sud A-1 well in 1979, and produces from Lower Cretaceous shales and sands overlain by Upper Cretaceous shales. The gas-water contact shows up as a seismic amplitude event.
